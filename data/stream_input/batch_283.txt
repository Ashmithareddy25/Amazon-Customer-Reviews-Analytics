0446604844|3.0|I thought this book wasn't bad by today's standards. I like a lot of action in a story, however, and it fell somewhat short in that area. I enjoyed parts of it, especially the last couple of chapters, and any more that's about as good as the mainstream fiction work gets.
B00006SFLV|5.0|The only thing wrong with this series is that it was too short! Leave it to network television to cancel a show as wonderful as MSCL after only 19 episodes. What an outstanding 19 episodes they are, though! MSCL was probably the first primetime show (and perhaps the only) to depict such a realistic view of high school life. Angela Chase was a nice girl from a nice family that had their problems like any other family. She outgrew her childhood best friend & instead chose to hang out with two new eccentric & more exciting friends, Rayanne and Rickie--two of the best characters ever on television. She also had a crush on Jordan, the good-looking, quiet guy, who always looked serious & had somewhat of a bad-boy image. She didn't have a crush on the popular football player like most teenage girls are expected to. This show covered many serious & real issues in it's short run from teenage homosexuality, bullies, teenage sex & guns in school to being betrayed by your best friend & feeling like you can't trust your own parents. It even dealt with the problems in Angela's parents' marriage. The writing & directing in each episode are superb and so is the acting. Nothing is overly dramatic or in-your-face. There are subtle connections & ironies. When the characters explain what they're thinking or feeling, however unpoetic their speeches may be, you know exactly what they mean & that's the way it's supposed to be. I love the fact that they wear the same outfits more than once, that Angela only wears noticeable makeup on special occasions & that the teenagers don't speak like knowing adults & instead say 'like' & stumble and stutter over their words. This is without a doubt one of the best shows that has ever been on TV & it is definitely worth owning on DVD. You'll watch each episode over and over & never regret that you bought the collection!
0345448898|4.0|Sorry people, I don't buy it. Pullman has written an engaging series, full of intrigue, sci-fi, fantasy, suspense heroics, love and anger. Hate? Nope... it's just a good read, pure and simple. Why do we always have to dig down into a book for its hidden meaning, or a hidden agenda? Isn't it possible... just possible?... that an author simply wrote down a good story and made it into a book? Just my humble opinion, having been an avid reader of fantasy and sci-fi for almost 40 years. This is a simple story about good vs evil, like most other books it has its hero's, heroine's and evil mongers. I believe this is a bit complicated for a juvenile, but certainly nothing offensive. It's in the Harry Potter mode, but darker (as suggested by another reviewer), and perhaps more somber. Still, I would recommend it as a good read.
B000062Y98|5.0|This album is truely something else.  In my opinion, Blind Guardian's sound has only improved since Nightfall in Middle-earth.  The opening songs of Precious Jerusalem and Battlefield is a strong way to start a record.  Along with those two, track 5, The Maiden and the Minstrel Knight slows down the pace with a ballad that isn't wretched to listen too.  Actually, it is quite enjoyable.  The final track is another version of Harvest of Sorrow in Spanish and also the best yet.<BR>But the real reason to buy this album is for the single: And Then There Was Silence.  A 14 minute epic that is truely awsome and probably their best song recorded.  It's not one to get boring and keeps you interested with the several different sections of varying pace and dynamics.  <BR>In short, this isn't one that should be missed.
0385508417|4.0|Yes, it was a very light and easy read, but it was enjoyable and funny, too.  We read it on the drive back from California.  We also decided it would make a cute movie with Steve Martin at Luther.
B00006CYAD|5.0|Lets see I have been listening to SIMPLE PLAN for about 6 months now.  I love there cd and I know every song lyric by lyric.  I am sad that they are becomming more popualar, because I considered them my band.  I love there songs because I can relate to them. I am looking forward to them touring over here, in the Western US parts.  Great Job Simple Plan and looking forward to your next cd and songs.
B00006LWSF|4.0|This CD is pretty good. The 3 songs on this CD are \\"Lose yourself\\" by Eminem, \\"8 Miles and Run'n\\" by Jay-Z, and \\"8 Mile Road\\" by EM. Although only one or two songs are actually in the movie I'd say buy this CD. If you are looking for the actuall music that was in the movie, I'd reccomend getting the \\"More Music from the motion picture 8 Mile\\"
0060930187|5.0|This is probably my favorite book ever.  As a self-diagnosed bipolar, cynical, angry teenage girl I can say that Sylvia Plath puts what millions of us feel every day into exactly the right words.  [...] But then I read it again.  And again.  Probably too many times.  Plath knows exactly what she is talking about, this book is heartbreaking and personal.  It's like Catcher in The Rye with a poetic Franny as the main character, only Ester's way more [messed] up than Franny.
0060278269|5.0|i absolutely love sabriel and lirael, so i'm sure that i (and all readers) will like abhorsen just as much.  i've already read the first six chapters of it online ([...]) and they are fabulous!! nix did't post the prologue on his site because it supposedly has a huge spoiler in it...i cant wait to read it!!  even just in the first six chapters, the characters have become more developed and the plot is getting more complicated and intense, as readers of sabriel and lirael will know it was bound to.  i'm planning on buying abhorsen as soon as possible and i recommend for others to do the same!!
B00004Z459|5.0|Does anybody here really understand just how good this cd is?  I don't care if it's been done before.  I don't care if you think some of the songs are redundant.  I don't care what kind of music you like.  If you do not like this cd, then what in the world do you listen to?  This may be the only cd I have that I can listen to straight through and enjoy every song.  I say again:  EVERY SONG ON THIS CD IS GOOD.  I'm a pretty tough critic when it comes to cd's, and I don't know how anybody could give this cd anything less than 5 stars.  Nothing more needs to be said.
B000005HN6|5.0|Opeth  has the most amazing sound, in the death metal  world. I like to set opeth aside from   bands  like, Cannibal corpse,deicide,six feet under, etc. Opeth doesnt grow throught an whole song... They sing,harmonize, play acoustic and piano, which i think makes it classical, as well as progressive . Again these Bands like cannibal corpse,  six feet under,deicide and others, seems always limited to their ability to realy sing and play guitar solos.Well, this album \\"orchid\\" is an amazing,beatifully,agressive, fast, over all excellent music  for any one to listing to, even if you are not into death metal.  I feel so lucky for owning this  beatiful art on vinyl, yup ! Thats right, vinyl.  Opeth is the most superior progressive/deathmetal/rock and roll  band to ever be formed.  Suppert these  genious of music alright ? tchau !
0553382179|5.0|I recommend this book to EVERYONE, whether you're just getting started managing a home or you're doing things the way you've always done them... there is a better way!! The system works. This is not a manual telling you what each type of household cleaner is for or what kinds of gadgets can organize your closet space... it's a new way of life! <br />I used to write for a local newspaper as a home care advice columnist, and I have 136 books on home organization and housecleaning that I just GAVE AWAY because they were cluttering up my bookshelves, and THIS is the only one I needed to keep! Plus, the author has a whole support network waiting for you [online]! Believe me, this is not a complicated system, it's common sense and a wonderful mentor. One of my favorite sayings in the book basically says \\"your house didn't get like this overnight, and it's not going to get clean overnight.\\" Please give this one a try (and if you don't like it, give it to a friend who's having trouble with organization... maybe they will be able to use it!)
B00006SFBD|5.0|Im so proud to be an fan on this amazing band known as opeth. I just bought this album today... Let me tell you something, it's  the most beatifull piece of art. I know it's far realy far from their early  albums obvilious but it still better then ever.  I love opeth's orchid,still life,blackwaterpark  so much that i coulnd stop listing to those albums. Deliverance to me is another masterpiece from  opeth il cherish to the day i die. Buy it you will not regred it.
B00006C79E|4.0|What else can be said that hasn't already? Best Etienne album since Good Humor, without a doubt. Revisits older territory, splashes on some new studio trickery, as usual about twelve lightyears ahead of any other modernist pop outfit. Yes, 'Soft Like Me' is a bit cringeworthy. Yes there are dull, meandering spots. But look, the best music takes time to blossom for the listener, and anything worth doing takes work. Case in point: 'Amateur'. Another reviewer called it 'nerve-wracking'. I might have agrred with him/her at first listen. But Saint Etienne, underneath their glossy pop shimmer, can have this amazing, sinister undercurrent. Bob and Pete have a way of introducing melodic elements over the course of an entire track that gradually deliver the final crescendo, almost by insinuation. You hear this stark keyboard plonk, and it's awkward and thudding, but if you will get your naughty finger of the skip button, you see this jerky, fumbling fragment flower into a grand, sweeping hook. You are not allowed it all at once. Stark, imposing, bassed-out, becoming lit from within-- that is 'Amateur', and that is the essence of Saint Etienne.
B00003CXI1|5.0|The only thing better than the movie is the book.  Perfectly cast, and perfectly played.  One of the best DVDs of the year, along with Fellowship and Signs (2003).
6305280762|4.0|There comes a time in many a great actor's career when he's got to deliver a bum line in a big budget crowd pleaser. He's read the script. He knows what's coming. Like the bomb, it's forever hanging over him. One day, very, VERY soon he knows it must be delivered. How's he going to do it and not come across as a complete and utter dweeb? He can gabble through them and hope nobody notices (they WILL!) Or he can tackle them full on. The moment of maximum danger arrives. Tension at this excrutiating and frightening predicament is rising to fever pitch. They are in the lift. Captain O'halloran turns to the doomed actor. \\"You guys just keep building 'em higher and higher....\\" Paul Newman sighs, then looks straight at his feet as if avoiding the gaze of the public and also to put as much distance between himself and the line as possible. Can he do it? I think he's going to faint. Suddenly, he comes up for air by swinging his head in a dramatic KO right at McQueen. \\"Hey, are you here to take ME on or the fire?\\" Catharsis. Release. Bank cheque. Three weeks rest in Bermuda. McQueen stares at him with a 'there but for the grace of God' expression. He knows he has been given a very good scene later on where he is told just what he is expected to do to put out the fire. But tomorrow....?<br />Bigelow is trapped in a small room with his secretary surrounded by a wall of flames. \\"Nobody knows we're up here\\" he solemnly confesses to her. Hang on a minute, you told Jim Duncan you were going up to the promenade room. I think you're over-reacting, old chap.
B000066C87|4.0|For those who relish the upstairs/downstairs cultural clash of the passe English social system, this movie is a magnificent wallow!  Touted as a murder mystery, the film is driven largely by an implicit, though heavy-handed condemnation of the inequities between aristocrats and servants.  By showcasing nearly every conceivable abuse and slight that could confront those in service, the movie almost becomes a tiresome screed against the wellborn of Britain.  Intriguing characterizations and wonderful performances, however, save the day--and prove once again why films involving UK actors and plots can be so mesmerizing.
0060977493|2.0|But I have to say I do not understand how anyone can enjoy this book. The book is terribly depressing. I don't mind a book with sad moments and such, but The God of Small Things doesn't really make the reader sad (I never shed a tear) but just depressed at how horrible these people lives are. The book revolves around a series of terrible events. I actually rather like the non-linear aspect of this book, but Roy really does use it for the purpose of making everything more depressing. As other reviews have mentioned, you know what happens at page 100 (some others complained about it being confusing, which outside of maybe keeping some of the characters straight I don't see how this books could be). While you may know that Romeo and Juliet die from the very first, its not what the whole play is about, and some happy things did happen. This book just goes on and on, a definite \\"things can't get any worse\\" then they do type of situation. As pointed out the book ended rather nicely (in a depressing sort of way of course) but that doesn't excuse the other 315 pages. <BR> <BR>And its not interesting either. I understand thats its somewhat of a steam-of-consciousness thing, jumping from one memory to another. But it doesn't give the author an excuse to go on about some unimportant detail. The first thing I noticed was the repeated violent metaphors and lack of plot, luckily her overuse of metaphors doesn't really carry throughout the book. There was never much plot, at least when compared to the amount of text. More about what people are thinking and, of course, the \\"small things.\\" While I have a hard time understanding why people enjoy reading about grotesquely miserable and often evil people, I can understand that some people enjoy books more heavy on character without much plot or action (and by that I don't necessarily mean adventure, but simply things happening), I'm just not one of them. <BR> <BR>I did finish the book in a day and a half, which I can partly credit to my wanting to get it over with, but also to Roy's relatively easy to read writing style (I'll take incomplete over run-on sentences any day) that allowed me to read at the same rate I read a fantasy, as opposed to a slower rate when I read a cryptic piece of literature. This could also partly be due to the high amount of unimportant details. <BR> <BR>I should probably end this review by saying this book was assigned to me for a World Literature class, and its not the kind of book I would normally pick up, but I did finish it (and this review) before the semester started so I don't have any assignments or lectures to affect my opinion of the book.
B00005JL96|5.0|This is a gem of a movie.  Stitch is definately the star of this movie and adds the right degree of humor throughout the movie.  Kids and adults will enjoy this movie and so it is excellent family entertainment.  The love between the two sisters and their ability to eventually open their hearts to others at the end of this movie make it a moral and moving tale.  It is just a pleasure to watch a movie with plot, storyline, timing, humor, etc. all working together for a change.
0316666343|1.0|I just don't understand how this book rose to bestseller status. The writing is average at best, and the concept too weird to sustain my interest. Granted, the first fifty or sixty pages held me, but after that I put the book down and didn't pick it up again. Maybe timing is the answer to this book's success. Yeah, that's it. Has to be.
B0000640VO|2.0|This movie exudes the sort of Gallic charm that only the French can produce.  It would work better if it weren't so long and if the endless concoction of self-conscious contrivances were not so tedious.  Undeniably this movie has its moments, primarily thanks to Audrey Tatou, but in the end it's just tiresome.
B000063CMK|5.0|I love this album.(period)....I am only 19 and have only been listening to prog for abotu 5 years, so needles to say I don't have the experience w/ this music as most listeners do...but I can't stop listening to this album....I have enjoyed many recordings before...but none to this degree.....I think that POS is teh PERFECT mix between emotion,metal,prog,and energy....I love dream theater but they do allot of showing off w/ huge solo sections (mainly on thier newer work)...but w/ POS it seems to be more abotu the songs themselves....well honestly I could go on and on abotu this band......but I just felt liek telling everyone I love the album....and please buy it if you feel the urge.....I can't garante that you'll love it...but just listen w/ an open mind...and try not to be TOO judgmental
B000063DI9|5.0|I don't have a lot of time to write, but I will convey a few opinions about this album.<br />Not only do I view this as Iron Maiden's best work, I also hold it as one of my top five favorite albums from ANYONE. After reading some other comments, I find it interesting that the songs other people don't really care for are the very same songs that I cannot get enough of. The title track and Moonchild were initially my favorite songs from the effort, however I grew to love The Prophecy - which is still my favorite song. The only thing I don't like is that it's so short.<br />I recommend this album to anyone who appreciates awesome guitars, great bass, non-repetitive &amp; strong drums, searing vocals and all-around great music.
B00005JL7Q|4.0|This movie has some of the best music in it since another favorite of mine - &quot;Rushmore&quot; (if you haven't seen that film you're missing a treat).  Hugh Grant is perfectly cast and everyone else is great also.  I recommend this movie!
B00006CXSS|5.0|My father was a veteran of the D-day landing on Normady Beach and I had very little understanding of his experiences. Like most WWII veterans, he never talked about it.  I think this DVD set is an exceptional collection that gives us an appreciation of the sacrifices &quot;The Greatest Generation&quot; made to the modern world.  The film, Saving Private Ryan, and this collection should be required viewing of all high school and college American history students.  Absolutely an outstanding production!
B00006RU5B|4.0|I think alot of critizism of this record tends to be buried in the past.  After listening to nothing but jazz for 6 months, I find this record to be an interesting sound in my return to rock music.  I think people forget that this isn't supposed to be rage, or soundgarden, and I find comparisons to the likes nickelback and creed to be a little farfetched.  But don't listen to me, check it out for yourself, because this record is definitely worth a shot.
0767805712|5.0|Gattaca is by far one of the best sci-fi movies I have ever seen. It's about a man named Vincent who overcomes a prejudicial system impossed upon him through sheer self determination, who doesn't accept anything less than the full attainment of his dream. The story line was both inspiring and thought-provoking, the acting was great (especially Hawke and Law), and the production design and art direction were totally stunning. There are little special effects, which sets this movie apart from other sci-fi movies. Gattaca is simply a beautiful unique work of art filled with emotion, intelligence, beauty, and suspense. Definitely a must see for anyone.
B000002H33|5.0|Never, ever again will you hear an album of this magnitude. A sweeping statement, I know.  However, this is metal at it's most impressive.  From the opening flamenco cords of BATTERY through the sheer genius of MASTER OF PUPPETS, the lyrical angst and musical power of WELCOME HOME and DISPOSABLE HEROES, to the almost nihilistic qualities of DAMAGE, INC., this is, quite simply THE best album of all time (let alone the best MetallicA album).  Anyone who was lucky enough to catch them live when they toured this album (with ANTHRAX in Europe)in 1986 knows what I mean when I say that this was musical power at it's most awesome. They would also have been in the fortunate group, like myself, who saw CLIFF BURTON live before he was tragically killed.  As an epitaph for a true metal god, there is nothing more fitting than this album.  Oh, and if you've only got this album on CD - do yourself a favour and get it on vinyl.  The sound is awesome!!<BR>
B00007E8V4|5.0|the whole cd is awesome but i personally like ego brain and rulette the best
B00006J3T4|5.0|Knopfler's new record is so good it's hard to believe.  The songs are varied, with an emphasis on folk blues.  The production is stellar.  The melodies are gorgeous.  I also note that these are songs one does not get sick of.  The overall effect is both mellow and inspiring.  Anybody who is even a casual Knopfler fan could buy this CD risk-free.  And any true Knopfler fan who doesn't own the CD should place an order for one immediately.
B00006CXSS|5.0|I will review each episode of this series separately. <br />EPISODE ONE: CURAHEE <BR>Depicts boot camp. This episode is actually one of the best, despite the lack of action. There is drama inherent in the attempts to oust the incompetent, cruel Cpt Sobel, without being executed for mutiny. The savagery of boot camp reminds one of Full Metal Jacket.<br />EPISODE TWO: DAY OF DAYS<BR>Depicts the drop on D-Day. The main character is Dick Winters, who leads a vital attack on a German battery with only thirteen men. The fight scenes here are exquisite; and the shots of the drop itself - with flak and ack-ack flying everywhere - really make a mockery of The Longest Day!<br />EPISODE THREE: CARENTAN <BR>This is my favourite episode. It depicts the travails of a quiet and nonviolent private named Albert Blithe. This episode is rather reminiscent of The Red Badge of Courage, with the viewer left wondering: does Albert Blithe find courage when he shoots the German?? - or does he become everything he dreads - a killer without remorse? My favourite scene is where Cpt Speirs, the cold-blooded killer, tries to convince Blithe not to have so many qualms about combat. <BR>Not only do you get this fine psychological drama, but you also get easily the bast battle-scene in the series - the tank battles to the southwest of Carentan. You've never seen a war-film until you've seen US Paratroopers fending off German Jagdpanther self-propelled guns! The Americans even counterattack in a dramatic (and historically accurate) tank-battle: the Shermans crash into the flank of the German armoured units, forcing them to retreat.<BR>This episode is perfectly scripted and acted, and would probably be Oscar material if it had been released cinematically.<br />EPISODE 4: REPLACEMENTS<BR>Not as strong as the first three episodes, this depicts the Arnhem Campaign. Yet another tank battle, near Eindhoven, in which the British Cromwell tanks get trounced by none other than the famous German Tiger tanks.Very impressive. I have never seen a film with such realistic German tanks. The human element concerns the hobbit-like Sgt Bull Randleman, and his replacement-squad, which has to prove itself in battle.<br />EPISODE 5: CROSSROADS<BR>This episode has a very impressive battle against German SS infantry at the beginning - again, very accurately recreated. Dick Winters becomes head of Battalion, leaving Easy Company to Lt Dike. Not a particularly strong episode, lacks some structure. On the other hand, this is the episode directed by Tom Hanks; and there is some fine camera-work here, with striking imagery.<br />EPISODE 6: BASTOGNE<BR>This episode may be the weakest of the lot, with some poor acting and not-very-compelling scripting. But it is still worth watching. Hopeless love blossoms between medic Eugene and a Belgian nurse. This is the episode where McAuliffe is asked the surrender, and replies \\"Nuts!!\\" Not a lot of fighting or human story.<br />EPISODE 7: THE BREAKING-POINT<BR>This may possibly be the best episode, along with Episode 3. This episode truly captures the horrors of war. The constant shelling at the Battle of the Bulge has dreadful consequences as some of the company begin to go crazy. They are preparing to assault the village of Foy, near Bastogne. Led by the incompetent Lt Dike, Easy Company is slaughtered in the open. This film really shows what military incompetence can do., One is gritting one's teeth and yelling at Dike to get a move on!!!<br />EPISODE 8: THE LAST PATROL<BR>This is also one of the best, showing the effects of combat fatigue like no other film, not even PLATOON. Easy Company is so exhausted that they wander along half-asleep. Yet they are forced to defend Alsace from Hitler's new offensive. After the slaughter at Bastogne, one a few men are left in each platoon! Most tired of all is Malarkey, one of the most overworked men in the company. <BR>Contrasted with them are Webster, a man who has not seen the company since October 1944and is treated like an outsider; and Jones, a freshfaced Westpointer who has just joined up. The contrast between the semi-conscious, fatigued Company and these two clean, fresh soldiers is unforgettable. The title refers to the patrol raid that takes place at the end of the episode - the last fight-scene in the series.<br />EPISODE 9: WHY WE FIGHT<BR>This is the episode where Easy Company relieves part of the Dachau complex of concentration and labour camps. Not one of the men is forewarned about such places, and one new recruit nearly goes crazy. Despite the accurate and affecting depictions of such horrors as walking skeletons and piles of corpses, and the fact that I like Beethoven string quartets, this episode is not actually very good. It lacks a certain dramatic unity. <BR>However, it is still well worth watching, especially to see the effects on Easy Company of seeing the Holocaust. Seeing the usually stolid and unmoveable Pte Bull Randleman vomiting is not something one forgets easily. <BR>No battle-scenes.<br />EPISODE 10: POINTS<BR>The episode that takes place after the surrounding of the Ruhr pocket. No battle scenes. Dull episode? Hardly! The episode is dramatic and intriguing, especially when the men liberate The Eagle's Nest at Rastenburg. It is moving to see the part near the end where we are told where the men all did after the war. <br />I think I've gassed on long enough; I'll shut up now. But each episode of this series really is like a separate war film, and each deserves its own attention. Altogether the series is extremely impressive, and constitute my favourite war films.
B000069AUI|3.0|Ok--for all those familiar with the Stone Roses and their decline from their first and second releases:  \\"Parachutes\\" was never as perfect as the Stone Roses debut CD.  And \\"A Rush..\\" is not near as bad as the Stone Roses sequel \\"Second Coming.\\"  If that is good news to you, then rejoice.  But while the Stone Roses' collapse was devastating, Coldplay's letdown with this sophomore effort is more predictable.  Some of the songs here are great, some just fine.  Others just don't grab you even after playing it repeatedly.  It is fun to guess their influences:  some of the phrasing and/or production sounds like (alternatively) Pink Floyd, 1970s Kinks, and even the Police.  Some of the worst tracks remind me of the Counting Crows.  I think the first four or five songs hold the high quality standard set on Parachutes.  The others are a wash. I know this review may make fans irate, but the proof is in the listening to the more objective listener.  And in the used bins around town--Parachutes is not to be seen whereas there are lots of trade-ins of A Rush of Blood to the Head.  Better going next time, fellas.
B000005JA8|5.0|Ok, if you've read any of the other reviews, then I'm sure your aware that this album is &quot;difficult&quot;.  It's true, it's not an album that you can throw on at a party or spin at the local dance club. I put it on at work, and had great fun watching other peoples reactions to it. So yeah, I suppose that this albums difficult. I don't however think that it's difficulty is what makes it a great album, but maybe that that the difficulty is a sympton of what is so wonderfull about this album, it's total originality and artistic creativity... or maybe just plain artistic genius.  <BR>First of it's just plain ignorance to say that the band must be horrible. The Magic Band was VERY talanted, and it's the ability to fit sounds and notes together in a totally new and creative way that displays this talent best. Then there's Beefhearts lyrics, amazing poetry, thats astounding in it's non-linear ability to just work words together for reasons other then their literal meanings. It's incredible that someone was doing this at all, let alone when this album was created. <BR>But yeah, this album isn't for everyone. I think it could be, but a lot of people aren't that patient. That's fine, in the end most people end up enjoying this album in the long run anyway. In fact you prbably allready do... Don't believe me? Who do you listen to? Chances are most of your favorite rock musicians probably treat this album like a bible.
B000007WNN|5.0|One of my favorite all-time albums, definitely a desert island disc.   Rick Rubin's production strips down the often \\"sappy, U-2 like guitar sounds of Billy Duffy into pure rock fury, Marshall Stacks set on 10.   Astbury's singing has never been  better.  While \\"Love\\" is a great album, it's almost \\"new-wave\\" metal sound  borrows too much from bands like U-2 and The Cure.   \\"Electric\\" is flat out metal. Everything is upfront and in your face with no subtleties whatsoever.  This album deserves to be played at max-volume.  So if you can't crank it up, don't buy it!!!   The Cult's best album in my book.
B00003CXXM|4.0|Lots of people compare this movie with Minority Report.  Both are full of action, have big stars,....are now both on DVD.  Anyway, while I did enjoy Minority Report...lots...it's good, trust me, for my money I pick Bourne Identity as the better of the two.  You go into Minority Report with all kinds of baggage that Tom Cruise and Speilberg bring to any movie they make.  Bourne Identity makes no pretentions about the uber-movie it's going to be.  It's simply a fun movie to watch, with cool action scenes and a hot chick.  Try it out
B000068TPN|2.0|I love a good, well-made war movie (i.e. Saving Private Ryan, Full Metal Jacket, Hamburger Hill etc.), but this film is a complete failure.  Not only are the characters poorly developed and the script lacking in credibility but the combat scenes are reminiscent of those badly filmed war movies of the 1950s and 60s. Though this film might be historically accurate, its visually absurd at times, with the Vietnamese troops blindly running into torrents of fire, often in single file.  Ridiculous.  Frankly, its insulting.  There are far better films than this to spend your money on.  This one falls flat.
0066214122|5.0|Being an avid Michael Crichton fan, I must say I am quite pleased with his latest work, &quot;Prey.&quot; Although it starts a little slow as Crichton lays the groundwork and explains the basics behind nanotechnology.

B00003W8NM|3.0|\\"Fight Clubs\\" evokes passionate responses; it bewilders some, digusts others, and awes many, particularly young males. If it impresses with the chances it takes in narrative form and cinematic bravado, it also proves problematic, cohering only on a peripheral level and ending its tale with a rather forced resolution that doesn't quite pull the thematic elements together. Fincher is, without a doubt, a talented director with a visual style all of his own; he produced \\"Fight Club\\" with a sparkling clear, but gloomy, photography that highlights its exisentialist ideas. But the telling is too forceful and heavy-handed, relaying its meaning and themes with blinders on. But by far the biggest drawback is that \\"Fight Club\\" is not as smart as it thinks it is. Its philosophy is ultimately too simplistic to be convincing.Among relatively new directors, Fincher is at the head of his class; his style is sophisticated enough to be taken seriously, and he generally handles his films with impressive skill. It's a treat to see, for example, how well he combines CGI techniques with traditional camerawork in this film.  But his direction is far from perfect.  While it's not a fault of the film by any means, my other problem with \\"Fight Club\\" is the mythic status it has attained among specific segments of the movie-going public. It's a film that is prone to over-intellectualizing and hyberbole, and since its release it has been a victim of both. By the way, if you do like this film, you will be happy with the DVD; the picture and sound quality is top notch.

B00005JKPF|3.0|The whole premise of there being of a mutant population throughout the world is the first thing that makes this movie lose its edge. For example, How interesting would it be to watch Superman if every other person in this world possessed similar powers. Nevertheless, if this concept was done right lets say with an apocolyptic or cryptic view, may be it could have been pulled off but, this movie consistantlhy loses its focus on the hero's and villians. It jumps from scene to scene senselessly. Even the X-Men's looked more like a group of plain people that put on their cheap holloween costumes. Hugh Jackman did a descent job of posing as the wolverine with his side burns but, were is the rest of the outfit?.  It seemed like the script and special effects were rushed in this film. <BR>Overall X-men is a decent movie that should have been a classic on a par with the Superman series and Batman 1 and 2, however it ends being a notch below.
B000066AXC|4.0|Ron Howard's direction of \\"A Beautiful Mind\\" is much like that of \\"The Sixth Sense\\" in that it is only much later in the film that we see certain realities of the main character's world for what they are.   It does lose points with me, however, for not portraying certain aspects of John Nash's life accurately. Ignored, for example, is the fact that his wife, the initially spunky and forceful, Alicia, is El Salvadorian, and while Jennifer Connelly's portrayal of her was well-done, she could have adopted a more Spanish-sounding accent for the part.   While a bit beefy for the lead role, Russell Crowe submerges himself nicely into the character of the eccentric, socially inept John Nash, complete with a Southern twang. The film features the usual cornerstones of a Crowe performance: Displays of brute strength, moments of violent rage, pensive charm, subtle glances from his very expressive heavily-lashed blue-green eyes, quick and pleasant witticisms, a wry smile, and of course, his excerising his \\"right to bare arms\\", that last of which should keep the ladies interested.   The story of course, revolves around Professor Nash's bout with schizophrenia, his major contribution to the world despite his illness, and his ultimate triumph as a Nobel Laurate.   We first meet Nash as a loner at Princeton University about to work on his thesis, but not succeeding at doing so at first. There isn't too much emphasis on math itself, the least favorite subject of many of us in school, which was perhaps done to keep most of the audience interested in the film. But the palpable distance between Nash and the elderly faculty member being honored by the ceremony of the pens can be measured in light years, as Nash stands in the hallway, a lone and solitary figure once again on the outside.   His life is made even more complicated by his roommate (Paul Bettany) and his roommate's adoptive niece who never ages(Vivien Cardone), as well as Government agent William Parcher (Ed Harris), who never changes his clothes.   Christopher Plummer's Dr. Rosen appears on the scene to treat Nash, giving a calm intellectual, but slightly smug performance as the once esteemed Professor falls from grace and into his care.   The scene on Nash's recipience of shock treatment is reminiscent of Jack Nicholson's undergoing the same procedure in \\"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest\\". But while there is debate about how meticulously   schizophrenia and the events of Nash's life are portrayed (his otherwise unmentioned son, whom he had out of wedlock plays an orderly in the film), Crowe makes Nash a very sympathetic character, and perhaps the film has led more people to empathize with the plight of the mentally ill.We feel somehow, that Alicia was meant to be the guiding force in his life, although in reality, the couple were divorced for a time.   Later in the movie, there is another pens ceremony, but happily Nash is not at a distance from it this time.   The make-up job of the Nashes as an elderly couple could have been better. But Nash's address of the Nobel Academy, which in fact never happened, gives the film a final, romantic flourish.   The stately and haunting anthem sung by Charlotte Church is one of vigilance on behalf of those in need of guidance.   While sparing us many gritty realities of the Nashes' life together, Ron Howard's movie is one of hope and triumph, with only a muted kind of joy because despite Nash's great achievements, the battle for sanity continues.
6305232660|1.0|zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz  thats my reacion to this film. I expected a lot more from this movie then some depressing borefest. Its hard to believe that they refused to send nukes up to hit this rock as contigency plan C through Z. Obviously a politically correct self righteous narrow minded film crew made this movie. Not to mention that the special effects [were bad]
B000070WJE|2.0|I couldn't be a bigger fan of Robbie Williams, but this CD was a big let down.  First of all, be warned, its full of bad language.  My 13 year old son is also a fan and I won't let him listen to this one.  Secondly, this is mostly Robbie bragging about himself and his prowess.  He just signed a big contract and I think his head is about to explode.  He also puts down his fans saying, basically, that he is just using them for what he can get.  The melodies are nothing new either.  The two stars are for 'Feel' which is a decent, thoughtful song.  Sorry, but most people can't relate to the rantings of a British pop star.
0736041850|5.0|I think a book like this was well overdue. Its so nice to finally know with precision which muscles are working when performing popular strength training exercises. I'm amazed at the level of work that went into making it. Kudos to the person who did the drawings. They are exceptionally beautiful and highly detailed. I have just one complaint. The text that accompanies the drawings is very small in size but still readable.    <br />All in all this book is an absolute must for anybody who is serious about strength training or bodybuilding. It is a worthwhile visual aid in planning your training program to hit all muscle groups. It is worth every cent which is more than I can say about a lot of fitness books out there. Buy it !
6304806442|5.0|i can honestly say that this is one of my favorite movies. i haven't reviewed a movie before, so don't expect a really in depth article and whatnot, but i highly reccomend this flick. it's tone varies from being upbeat and humorous, to somewhat depressing, and really bizarre, but it stays very entertaining the whole way through. its got a great set of characters, and their constant randomness keeps the movie interesting through what isn't exactly a specific plot. the directing, the constant inner monologue, and the scottish dialect make it just a fun movie to see, and i watch it pretty much whenever i can. i'd also suggest disregarding other reviews that give it one star because of the phoniness of the baby on the ceiling... in the long run that really doesn't make a difference... so if you get the chance, i would see this movie whenever you could, i dont think youll regret it.
B00005OM4N|5.0|\\"Britney\\" is one of the best albums I own, seriously!  I have been a fan since forever and I bought this album the day it came out in stores, which was November 6, 2001.  Hehe, I'm so obsessed with Britney's music that I even remember all the dates her album have come out!  LOL.  What can I say about this album?  Is it worth the money? Yes.  \\"Britney\\" is a collection of sure-to-be pop hits.  The choices for singles that were released to the public were not very good choices (\\"I'm A Slave 4 U\\", \\"Not A Girl, Not Yet A Woman\\", \\"Overprotected\\", and \\"Boys\\"), although those songs are among the best of her singing career.  These singles didn't really blend with today's sound, but that's what makes her so unique and different in her own way.  I don't understand why everybody hates on her.  She's everything you could ever want and expect from an artist.  This album truly expresses Britney and is so amazing for a crossover album, from pure pop to Pop/R&B.  If you do not have \\"Britney\\" then I suggest you add this one to your CD collection.  It will be, without a doubt, one of your favorites.  Here's my review on all of the songs on it:<br />\\"I'm A Slave 4 U\\"- Very groovy and sexy song that makes you want to get up and do some belly-dancing.  It's a great song for clubs.  9/10<br />\\"Overprotected\\"- Probably one of the more \\"pop-ish\\" songs on the album but it's a great one.  It talks about feeling overprotected and not taking [stuff] from other people.  This is one of my faves.  8/10<br />\\"Lonely\\"- The most rock-ish song on here.  It's definitely the best song on the album, it's got everything.  Rock, R&B, Pop, and even a little rap from Britney in the middle of the song.  She displays her talent very well on this song.  10/10<br />\\"Not A Girl, Not Yet A Woman\\"-  A lot of people found this song annoying or not very good.  I actually tend to think it's very good.  Her voice may not be like Mariah's or Christina's but she still pulls it off.  7/10<br />\\"Boys\\"- One of the funkier songs on the album.  I like this one a little better than the remix.  Great song for dancing and parties.  The chorus is very catchy.  You'll love this.  9/10<br />\\"Anticipating\\"- This song has an 80's feel to it.  It's definitely a disco song.  Decent lyrics and the chorus is so wonderful sounding.  8/10<br />\\"I Love Rock N Roll\\"- A popular song on this album, although it was not a single here in the U.S.  This is a cover of Joan Jett's original from the 70's.  I like this one better because the chorus is catchy, better beat, and Britney's vocals are surprisingly very good.  8/10<br />\\"Cinderella\\"- The most pop-ish song on here.  Nice lyrics and a decent chorus.  My favorite part is in the middle of the song when she sings \\"She has got to gooooooooo....\\".  Her voice sounds good in this one.  9/10<br />\\"Let Me Be\\"- Nice R&B feel to it, with a tad of hip-hop.  7/10<br />\\"Bombastic Love\\"- This song didn't really capture me at first but I grew to love this song.  I don't know what it's about though.  The orchestra music sounds really cool in this song.  7/10<br />\\"That's Where You Take Me\\"- This is one of my favorites!  I love the melody, lyrics, and her vocals.  The way this song was done is just amazing.  One of the slower tracks on here but has a little beat to it.  I love it!  10/10<br />\\"What It's Like To Be Me\\"- The chorus is absolutely danceable!  I love this song because it's so catchy and her voice sounds good.  The breakdown part is good in this song.  One of the best on the album.  9/10<br />Go buy this album!  NOW!
B00005NB0H|5.0|This is my 3rd fave Who album (#2 is Tommy, #1 is Sell Out,) but only by a hair. The band plays a full version of Tommy live, as well as a blistering set of stuff from their Mod-rock phase. &quot;Heaven and Hell.&quot; Is there not a better opener than THAT? I think not. Even &quot;I Can't Explain,&quot; &quot;I'm A Boy,&quot; and &quot;Summertime Blues&quot; sound killer here. I have the one-disc version, without the Tommy set. However, whoever assembled the album snuck in &quot;Amazing Journey/Sparks,&quot; and for that alone I'm fully satisfied.  &quot;A Quick One While He's Away&quot; is always better live than on the original vinyl. There's nothing about the album that should be broken up and analyzed. That's the great thing with any live album-it's just fun to listen to. It's like watching a live sitcom as opposed to one without an audience (like Monty Python's TV show as opposed to their first film, fellow Python nerds must agree with me on that,) If you have any doubts of the Who being the best band ever (or why Keith Moon and John Entwistle are dead, and why Pete Townsend is now practically deaf,) then pick this one up! Long Live Rock, indeed!
B000069AUI|5.0|This is seriously the best album of 2002! It has some of the most beautifully composed music ever! Coldplay is definitely a band that should be selling millions upon millions of CDs! Everybody who likes rock music needs to buy the CD and enjoy it! There are no songs to skip it is mean to be heard in its entirety, uncut. There are no explicit lyrics or offensive content which makes this music suitable for all ages (I don't know if younger kids will dig this kind of music but for those who do, this is a must have!) This CD is much much much much much better than Eminem's The Eminem Show which to date is the best selling CD of 2002! But I frankly think that CD fell short of the expectations I had for it. But \\"AROBTTH\\" took my expectations and multiplied them and filled them up! The music is so beautiful to listen to. I hate it when people compare them to Radiohead, because Coldplay sounds to me like, hmm, let me think, uh COLDPLAY! I think everyone should get this awesome CD today. Plus while you're at it pick up the first album \\"Parachutes\\" which I haven't heard yet (I have to get it soon) but is surely an awesome disc! PICK THIS UP!
B000002OZY|5.0|This was the first Who album I heard. My father loves old hard rock, and it certainly has rubbed off on me. We both agree that what made this album so compelling wasn't the story line (I mean, come on! A deaf blind mute who makes it playing pinball, then forms a religious cult?!) but in fact the music. The great thing is, unlike 'Quadrophenia', this could easily be played live. The only extra instruments used were the French horn and an occasional keyboard part. Not once was a brass section used, or synths, or strings, or any additional augmentation beyond the actual band. The recording techniques (for any audiofetishists,) were pretty cool: Guitars tracks that weren't double tracked had an acoustic line recorded in sync with it, forming a rythmic &quot;hi-hat&quot; (for lack of a better term) for the listener. The album always stands out now to me not just as The Who playing loud (granted, they do,) but also as almost majestic. The &quot;See Me Feel Me&quot; Finale is one of the most regal rock songs I've ever heard, and that it's repeated ad infinitum as it gradually decrescendos into silence enhances it even more. (For a killer live version, I reccomend picking up 'The Kids Are Alright.') 'The Underture' works in a similar vein, being a 10-minute version of 'Sparks.' 'The Amazing Journey' is a fantastic song. Despite Moon's reputation as being Satan with a drum kit, his playing here is nothing like the first three records, with nothing but toms and cymbals audible from a distance. Some songs he doesn't even play! Of course, this album spawned a classic (&quot;Pinball Wizard&quot;) or two (&quot;I'm Free&quot;) but I think there are better throughout the album: &quot;Eyesight to the Blind&quot; is a great tune, if a bit short. &quot;Go To The Mirror Boy!&quot; is another gem. &quot;The Acid Queen&quot; and &quot;Christmas Morning&quot; are probably my favorites. Entwistle's two songs are sick (that's a good thing,) and aren't to be overlooked: &quot;Uncle Ernie (Fiddle About)&quot; and &quot;Cousin Kevin.&quot; If you don't have it, get it. Forget the movie, forget the stage show, forget Quadrophenia-this is The Who at their (second) best! Rock on!
0671027344|4.0|I'd been told that this book was similar to The Catcher in the Rye, and it is on some levels. It's structured as a series of letters from the main character (Charlie) to an unknown recipient. Charlie is a delightful main character...introspective, sensitive, insightful, and never angsty (this is the big difference from Catcher). Chbosky tackles pretty much every issue that a teen could possibly face...drugs, alcohol, love, loss, you name it. While I didn't find it to be the most original book, I loved the writing style and there were a ton of great quotes. As a plus for book lovers Charlie reads a good number of well-loved classics and gives his opinions on them as he relates them to his life. Some of the titles include The Fountainhead, The Catcher in the Rye, The Stranger, The Great Gatsby, and To Kill a Mockingbird. Overall very touching and engrossing.
6305001162|2.0|I suppose the buying audience for this film is people who have already seen it. Being so, advice on film quality is really more important that a review of the movie, so let me say, that the DVD sound is not improved over the videotape, other than the general DVD over video quality one expects. Don't let the hype about redigitized or whatever hook you.<br />Also, understand the difference between full-screen and wide-screen. Full-screen means it will fill your entire TV screen. Since movies are broader left to right than TV screens \\"full-screen\\" movies have been \\"panned & scanned.\\" In other words, You see just part of the screen at once. \\"Wide-screen\\" means the whole picture is shown, with black lines at top and bottom. <br />Most people have a preference for one or the other. It's important to remember in the big choreography numbers that the panned & scanned versions are showing just half of the dancing. So be aware of what you're getting, especially if tou're buying used.<br />Now you can read my review of the content.<br />The ages of the actors in this film is obvious, and I personally found this really distracting. In a stage production, you can get away with casting 28-year olds as teenagers-- you can even get away with casting short adults as children sometimes. But this doesn't work in movies. --especially in a disturbing close-up of Olivia Newton-John's back teeth, as she milks one last \\"Su-uuuuu-mer Lo-ooooo-ve!\\" for all it's worth, but nevermind.<br />The actors were so obviously ten years too old to be in high school, that this added an unintentional extra layer to the film; it this really a fantasy of adults going back ten years to fix things in the past? This time Danny offers to drive, and Greased Lightning wins? This time Sandy finds the kishkas to change? This time Rizzo's not pregnant? Time Frenchy goes back to school? The overabundance of happy endings and the magic car in the closing shot left me wondering.<br />And Sandy at the end of the film?Sure, it might be time to shed the poodle skirts and pastel sweaters, but does she have to look like a 42nd & Broadway hooker? Isn't there a happy medium? And is \\"learn to smoke and dress like a slut in order to get the guy you want\\" really such a great message for the sweetness & light movie of 1978?<br />Well, anyway. sellers have lots of cheap used copies, the price of which is probably worth Stockard Channing's performance. Olivia Newton-John is a singer who can't act, and most of the rest of the cast is actors who sing passably. Stockard Channing is the only really substantial actor in the film (she's won some awards for her work on stage), and she's the only performer who comes through with a genuine character as opposed to a type-- although that may not be a fair criticism, since the script has a cartoon quality that suggests two-dimensional, broad, melodramatic types. Channing is also the only performer hired primarily for her acting who also can belt out a song.<br />My two stars are for her.
078322947X|5.0|Long before I went to the public library and read \\"The Wages of Fear\\"-- a fantastic book-- I became intrigued with \\"Scorcerer\\".<BR>   It had an edgy soundtrack and an edgy look.  Much of the tension and suspense was understated... and being plugged in to a more international view of the cinema, I loved the grit.<BR>   The characters are rock-hard and chisled tough.  You feel their intensity with a look or a phrase.  The setting is the stuff only B. Traven, and the guys from \\"Treasure of Sierra Madre\\" would be proud of... I could see Bogart playing Scanlon,the New York hood, Belmondo, Omar Sharif, and many other fantastic international actors in these parts.<BR>   The way the jungle [stinks] you in might seem, outwardly hokey, but Frankenheimer is masterful at using incliment weather and 3rd world rotting structures (like the rope bridge) to heighten the effect of man versus nature... and man is small in this.<BR>   How greed and ambition overcomes seemingly hopeless odds is amazing.  You root for the main characters, despite the fact that they are seedy criminals.  Amazingly enough... a great sense of humanity is defined, and you are transported into another world.<BR>   \\"Scorcerer\\" does not have the aires of \\"Agguire, Wrath of God\\" or its presumption.  These men are not fools or blustering dreamers... just desperate souls seeking some sense of practical salvation.<BR>   What a stroke of genius to have \\"Tangerine Dream\\" modulate the soundtrack... the mix of electronic moog musak and a dark, hungry jungle are magnetic.<BR>   BUY THIS DVD... they have really cleaned up the negatives and it looks great!
B000006MS3|5.0|Bush's most torturously inventive masterpiece, her fourth album \\"The Dreaming\\" is not for beginners (unless you already have a taste for \\"strange\\" music).  One reviewer remarks that \\"The Dreaming\\" is fully self-contained, that nothing before or after exists in Bush's catalog like this one.  That's generally true, except for the song \\"Breathing\\" from \\"Never for Ever\\", which very clearly sticks out on that album as belonging to this one. (\\"Breathing\\" is fairly \\"civilized\\" compared to \\"The Dreaming\\" though.)<br />\\"Sat in your Lap\\" starts immediately with a percussion riff, orchestra hits and a whole handful of curious vocal flourishes. When the lyrics proper start, Bush swings from husky commentary to multi-tracked growl-singing.  It's an amazing transformation from her earlier albums.<br />\\"There Goes a Tenner\\" is a lyrically amusing song about a botched bank job, with characteristically aggressive drums, a fairly simple piano line and Del Palmer's eternally delicious fretless bass.  Piano, bass and drums being the living skeleton of most Bush songs, even on this her most \\"out there\\" album, Palmer's contribution is inestimably important.<br />\\"Pull out the Pin\\", a song about the war in Vietnam from the point of view of a Vietnamese woman, is a simply amazing song. A vicious woodblock keyboard sound, light percussion, and jangly angry piano hang in the middle of the verse, while Bush and Palmer both slide and creep around on bass and voice.  For the chorus, strings add more meat, but the thing that sends chills down your back is Bush howling over and over in a never-before-heard (for her) gravely voice, \\"I love life, I love life, I love life.\\"  The dissonant, metallic guitar line at the end is right on with the rest of the music. And the way the song drags out at the end has always seemed symbolic to me of how the war in Vietnam dragged on.<br />\\"Suspended in Gaffa\\" (whatever that means) comes on with a violently contrasting piano waltz after the apocalypse of the last song.  Once again, hats off to Del Palmer. It's amazing to realize that the orchestration here is essentially the same as for the last song.  The vocals for the verse might seem a little light, but the shape alone of the chorus melody is captivating. How it sounds is even more so.<br />\\"Leave It Open\\" is ... indescribable.  Treated vocals, gorgeous vocal flourishes in the background, indecipherable lyrics, piano, bass and drums as the main backbone yet again.  Unquestionably one of the coolest things Kate Bush has ever done, when the big drums kick in at the end, the weird yells, the chorus of human voices, and then that multi-tracked (backmasked?) ghost-spirit seeming thing that drifts through is just spine-tingling. Even more tantalizing is the fact that this song (in ways you'll just have to hear for yourself) seems to be a companion piece to the last song on the album (\\"Get out of my House\\").<br />A candidate for strangest song on the album, \\"The Dreaming\\" is Bush's take on Aboriginal culture.  Almost entirely percussion driven with a didgeridoo groaning the whole time, again Bush counterpoises her \\"new\\" huskier low vocals with \\"old style\\" higher, more lyrical vocals (sharpened with her new edge). Meanwhile, literally scores of tweaky vocal variations are filling out the background, along with rushing cars, flapping bird's wings and a gong-like crash that it really very neat.<br />With \\"Night of the Swallow\\", Bush writes her most conventional song so far for the album. A beautiful piece with a self-evident debt to Irish music, the driving chorus is a great place to appreciate Bush's astonishing sense of melody and the way she bends and sculpts lines into the most improbably amazing and enchanting shapes.<br />\\"All the Love\\" is another jaw-dropper.  Recorded as if in a cave to create an almost agonizing degree of intensity, the combination of drum and fretless bass here is without peer. For the chorus, a boy soprano stands in for Bush, and at the end of the song, Bush samples goodbyes recorded from an answering machine while breathy gasps and sadomasochistic sounding woodblock slaps add accents.  Needless to say, Bush's vocals themselves are exquisitely beautiful.  Except for \\"Moving\\" or \\"Breathing\\", this could well be my favorite song by one of my favorite artists.<br />\\"Houdini\\" has a vocal bit in it that rubs me the wrong way, and a string section that doesn't really grab me.  Trivia: after Houdini's death, his wife went around debunking mediums that claimed to channel Houdini's spirit.  She did this because she and Houdini already had a prearranged secret phrase that would let her know it was really him.  In the song, the dead Houdini actually says the phrase.  Also, the bit about passing the key is historical; Houdini's wife would slip a key into his mouth with her kiss before they dropped him in a tank or box, etc.  The cover art illustrates this.<br />Another bafflingly creative song involving keys (\\"key\\" morphs into \\"keeper\\" in this song) and themes from \\"Leave it Open\\".  Toward the end, there is even a human braying like a donKEY (ee-yore, ee-yore).  Why? I have no idea.  It's always seemed to me like the lost boys from Peter Pan, who turn into donkeys. The lyrics don't help. (\\"I'm the concierge chez moi, honey. Won't let you in for love or money. My home my joy are barred and bolted. Get out of my house.\\")  The song starts off intense from the beginning and only gets even more so by the end with its creepy vocals, screams of \\"get out of my house\\", soaring, twisting vocals, indecipherable murmurs throughout.  It's as haunting and haunted as the original \\"Haunting of Hill House\\".  20 years later I'm still finding new things in it., Bush samples goodbyes recorded from an answering machine while breathy gasps and sadomasochistic sounding woodblock slaps add accents.

B00005JK8K|4.0|It seems to me that many reviewers on this site and many film critics did not like this movie because it does not discuss the Navajos as much as they thought it would and it is just not a good war movie.  I agree with the first part; the title is a bit misleading.  However, this is not a war movie.  It is an action movie that has a war setting.  The first clue to this should have been the director.  John Woo is not Steven Spielberg.  John Woo is not going to make the next Saving Private Ryan, but instead he is going to make an action flick, because that is what he is good at making.  As a result, the plot is sometimes hokey, but the battle scenes are exceptional in terms of action and violence.  Looking for a deep war movie in Windtalkers is like looking for an accurate depiction of the Navy in Under Siege.
B00000IGGA|5.0|There is no one to compare Tom Waits to. The man is a true original. We drove to Chicago to see him live, and it was hands down the best show I've ever seen. And Tom's recording methods bring a live sense to this album. You feel caught up in this oddball world he's created. And yet songs like &quot;House Where Nobody Lives&quot; catch you right where you are, managing to touch everyone while maintaining Tom's own vision. Probably my favorite album. A great intro if you haven't heard any Waits before.
6305546789|3.0|Generally, I don't like slasher horror flicks.  I like on-screen violence, therefore it does not scare me.  However, I decided that I should probably at least rent the definitive slasher flick, which turned out to be better than I expected.  I think the biggest problems occured in the second half of the movie, when Michael Myers actually kills people.  I found little to be frightened of at that point.  The beginning of the movie, on the other hand, was unbelievable.  The scenes when Laurie finds Myers stalking her at every turn bring chills.  As far as movies in this specific horror genre go, it is of course the best.  However, I think that the director could have done much more with the movie if he could have kept the eerie random appearances of Myers as the main source of scares rather than the murders themselves.
B00005JL78|1.0|I can't believe that's a Steven Spielberg film, if you're expecting action in this movie, forget it immediately ! The theatrical trailer is all that you've seen. Only a few minutes of action compared to over 120 minutes of tedious conversation, the film ends with a simple suicide of Max Von Sydow, that's too much ! Dts sound or not, it isn't helpful when the story line is boring.
B00006AW2P|5.0|This is, quite simply, the seminal Stones album; the roots of everything that was to come over the next 35+ years! When this album came out, it changed the way we thought about music. The reviewers who suggest that more songs be packed on the CD must be very young. You don't alter perfection...
0446677450|4.0|This book Is MSUT HAVE WILL USE BOOK, beacuse one you read the book you will use it in your everyday life and think of everything around you (money wise with a different light)<BR>In the book Robert often says that \\"people have spent years in school but learned nothing about money, and is result people learn to work for money, but never make money work for them.\\" When Robert refers to school in this way it was not to take away from school nor say don't go to school but educate parents who have children in school. In the book Robert also expresses that school is necessary but the parent must be a teacher also, the parent must teach the child about money and how to work with and for it to be successful because school doesn't teach you the proper tools to be rich. I agree with that because I attend school and all through my 12 years of school I have learned very little on how to make and save and just work with money, however I have been taught that you need a job for money, but I was not taught what to do with the money that I will be making from my job.
B000002O1Q|5.0|Some people have knocked this mix of soundtrack of the movie, but being a Jim Steinman fan, I still love the disc. OK, some of the 80's electronic sound is too pop and click for my taste anymore, but the Steiny compositions are masterfully delivered and as symphonic as pop music can get: the kind of stuff that can send chills up a spine. My CD came by way of the UK import; if you can nail it here at these prices, man, why wait? Tonight is what it means to be young...
B000069HK2|5.0|This is easily one of the top albums of the year.....about 2 or 3 songs sound a little popish...nothing more than that...i would advise anyone who wants a great cd to buy this..its unreal..anyone who says this album is \\"ok\\" is retarded...b/c this is a GREAT album...your money would be well spent if you buy this album...you should buy it anyway
1573225517|4.0|My second Nick Hornsby book went down as smooth as the first (&quot;About a Boy.&quot;)  Slick and Funny, &quot;High Fidelity&quot; is another easy tome of manly coolness and the deep mysteries of relating to women as an adult, instead of as a kid on the playground.  The writing style is sharp and the book flies by, clocking in at a few days read at the most.<br />Hornsby does a great job of capturing the strange realm of the &quot;collector,&quot; and of understanding that mode of life.  As the owner of a comic book store for a few years, I could relate to Rob's daily woes and the misfits that one can find oneself surrounded by.  The music makes for some nice interludes in the storyline.  The characters are not altogether likeable, but they do grow on you.<br />Like his other book I have read, &quot;High Fidelity&quot; is not exactly deep or thought-provoking, but it is fun.  Sort of like a pop song on in book form.

B00005JK8K|3.0|I had seen the previews for this movie for months and couldn't wait for it to come out on DVD.  It looked like it would be FANTASTIC!  I mean how could it miss?  It had a slew of big name actors - Nicolas Cage, Christian Slater, Adam Beach.  It was directed by John Woo!  It had a unique plot!  It had great scenes! Unfortunately, all of this couldn't save the movie.  <br />In case you don't know what the story is about-here goes.  The scene is WWII.  The Japanese continue to break the military's code for sending secret messages.  The Governement determines they can use Navajo Indians to transmit messages in their native tongue.  Turns out the Japanese never  were able to break this code!  So you would think the story would really focus on this extremely interesting story line.  It doesn't.  Although the story is about this it really focuses on the character of Nicolas Cage.  He's a Marine that ended up leading a platoon and falling into some really bad times.  He ends up responsible for one of the Navajo Coders.  The story really focuses on Nicolas' ghosts and problems he is dealing with - that's NOT what I wanted to see!  And his acting on this film was really flat.  In fact the acting of most of the characters was pretty flat.  To top it off, the film moved pretty slow too.<br />So, if you want to see some stunning war scenes, and just have to see Nicolas Cage, this is the movie for you.  I had a hard time staying interested in this very slow moving film.  Maybe the other aspects of it can keep you interested!<br />Enjoy...
0393974987|5.0|Since I have decided to dedicate part of my time spent reading in 2003 to the classics, I started first with The Mayor of Casterbridge, not the most famous of Hardy's works but seemingly a good place to start. I will definitely read the other works by this author since I was so captivated by this book.<br />The novel begins with the sale of Michael Henchard's wife and child to the highest bidder at a local summer fair. Henchard is drunk and his wife, tired of his habits, decides to leave with the sailor who bids on her and her daughter. Henchard wakes up the next morning, somewhat remorseful for what he has done and vows not to drink for twenty-one years.<br />The very next chapter picks up the story nineteen years later, with the return of the wife and child into Henchard's life. Henchard is now quite wealthy and is such an important man in his community, he is now Mayor of Casterbridge. From here, a series of wrong decisions and misunderstandings lead to the devastating conclusion.<br />Hardy is well known for his tendency towards gloomy endings and this book certainly fits the mold. But he is also well known for his lyrical descriptions of the English countryside and describing a way of life which had disappeared even in his own time. There were beautiful passages about the hay carts being driven through town, loaded so high that people on the second floor of homes could reach out and touch the top of the hay. Small details abound, describing the sound of rain on trees and the smell of the local foods. But perhaps the most significant aspect of the novel for me was the feeling that Henchard had wished for everything that had happened to him, and all of his wishes came true, and thus ultimately his downfall. These wishes were almost all made in a rash moment, when perhaps a minute or more of reflection could have produced a clearer head. Yet Henchard lives by his instincts, since for almost twenty years they seemed to serve him well.<br />I would recommend this book to any serious literature lover and I believe it serves as a good introduction to his other works. His books serve as a bridge from Victorian literature to modern literature, with no happy endings guaranteed.ok to any serious literature lover and I believe it serves as a good introduction to his other works.

B000005AYM|1.0|I really tried to like this CD, and I have to tell you that most music grows on me after time.  But this proved to be the exception.  It's hard to tell what Baduizm is which means it really does not qualify as an &quot;ism&quot;. If it's new school, what kind of new school? Indeed, I found it to be an eclectic mix of styles and themes lacking a core identity. The tracks are melodically rudimentary and rhythmically flat. Weak attempts to borrow techniques from trip hop. The only oasis in an otherwise desert-like sonic landscape is track 7. Too much negativity to bring?  Sorry, because overall, Baduizm lackluster musical experience.

B00006CXSS|5.0|I bought this dvd series because I heard it was really good and had the money to spare.  I'll always cherish this collection.  Simply put, these ten episodes documenting the sacrifice that these men gave for our country and for peace are quite possibly the best pieces of film to ever grace anyone's eyes.  I do not cry easily at all when watching movies or anything, last time I cried was when I was ten years old and I watched Swing Kids.  This movie had me choked up and teary-eyed at the very end of the last episode.  It's not based on a true story, it is a true story to the letter.  The veterans who were interviewed make it that much more real to the viewer.  No one has ever made a movie or show or any form of media that is so moving and powerful.  To not buy this or see it would be a disservice to yourself.
B0000797IO|4.0|The Good Girl is a difficult story in some ways, primarily because of its subtlety. Difficult for the viewer in that he/she will likely not know how to feel about its tone nor what to think, at its conclusion, about the morality and quality of life of its characters. For the filmmakers and actors, it must have been a greater trial. The deleted scenes portion of the DVD is revealing of the ultimate decision to deliberately leave out emotionally explosive and enlightening scenes, thus creating an ambiguous atmosphere throughout the film.<br />In The Good Girl, Justine Last (Jennifer Aniston) is lost, angry and ultimately dissatisfied with her life. Her husband is thoughtless pot smoker Phil Last (John C. Reilly.) Phil's best friend and partner in a house-painting business, Bubba (Tim Blake Nelson) sits eerily beside his friend and quietly longs for Justine. <BR> <BR>At the Retail Rodeo, Justine passes the days shirking her duties and chatting with friend Gwen Jackson (Deborah Rush,) until she meets Holden Worther (Jake Gyllenhaal,) quiet, closed off and actively depressed checkout person who enjoys reading and rereading Catcher In The Rye. Justine's soul-deep ennui urges her to connect with Holden and they quietly slip into an affair.<BR> <BR>The complications involve Gwen's food poisoning from bad blackberries, Bubba's continued fascination with Justine, and ultimately, the depth of Holden's mental illness -- sufficient to drag Justine headlong into lapses in judgment, compulsive lying and even a brief contemplation of murder.<BR> <BR>Yet as viewers, we walk away half-smiling, wanting for Justine to rip herself free from the mire her life has become. What might have easily turned into a clichéd romantic comedy or revelatory mid-life crisis \\"feel good\\" film has instead, under the skilled control of writer/actor Mike White and director Miguel Arteta, become an unnervingly life-like picture of personal upheaval. Every performance is strong, from Aniston and Gyllenhaal's desperate immorality right down to the comically twisted mischief carried out by Cheryl (Zooey Deschanel.) Love it or hate it, The Good Girl will leave you thoughtful.  <BR> <BR>The DVD (Twentieth Century Fox Home Video) is mis-packaged. Describing the film as \\"a quirky comedy about first encounters and second chances,\\" the blurb on the back of the DVD case is sorely misleading, likening the film's merits (or lack thereof) to what one might find in a Meg Ryan romantic comedy. <BR> <BR>DVD features include the 94-minute feature film in full screen and anamorphic widescreen, 9 deleted scenes, alternate ending, gag reel, full-length writer/director commentary, and best of all, an illuminating scene-specific commentary by Jennifer Aniston.
B00000K31Q|4.0|I'll admit right now, I tend to be a Shakespeare fan.  So I'm a bit biased going in. And, in this day and age, people are almost forced to come up with new ways to tell his stories, since there have been more than ample opportunities to see them 'traditionally.'  it's pretty much a filmmakers minefield when coming up with a new way to tell a story so many have probably heard before.<br />'10 Things I Hate About You' is a pleasant retooling of Taming of the Shrew.  What could have easily fallen flat or veered drastically off course is nicely done, with terrific casting, sharp writing, and a setting that actually seems to fit well with the original premise of the work.<br />Julia Stiles is perfectly cast as the difficult Kate.  Heath Ledger as well makes a great counterpart to her.  They have terrific chemistry and are a joy to watch together.<br />The minor characters as well are a hoot, and overall, it's a fun little film that you will enjoy vieweing many times.
0380789035|1.0|This book was waste of time. I read the first 210 pages and felt cheated. I kept waiting for the plot to develop and it never came close. How in the world did it win the Hugo? I may never read another Hugo winner.
6305513406|1.0|Star Trek is the first, and the greatest, sci-fi series.  So, what is the problem here?  Dog gone it! Why can I get New Generation and Deep Space Nine, and even Babylon Five first season DVD's that come in a nice box set, but not Star Trek TOS?  I don't want unnecessary clutter in my DVD library. I want 12 DVDs of Star Trek episodes, not 40. I want to buy them all at once, in a boxed set, not all helter-skelter, a couple of episodes here, a couple there.  I want mass quantities of extras: out-takes, commentaries, interviews, the works.  This is THE CLASSIC SERIES that started it all, and it deserves to be sold in a luxurious box set containing one years worth of episodes, in the order that they appeared. Paramount is being greedy and stupid.  I am EXTREMELY unhappy with how these episodes have been released, and will NOT purchase them until they pack the DVDs full, either with episodes, or GOOD extra material. I urge you to do the same.<br />..sorry about the rant.   Live long and prostrate.

014028009X|4.0|I'm doubtful that anyone will see this review, since I'm likely the last person in the world who hadn't read this book.  I've had it on my to-be-read shelf (actually, it's more like an entire bookcase--I can't stop buying) literally for years.  There just always seemed to be something that I wanted to read more.  I even broke my cardinal rule, and saw the movie first.  So, when I finally pulled it off the shelf to read on an eight-hour flight to Italy, I was expecting a light, easy, funny read.  <br />And that's just what I got.  Nothing earth-shattering, nothing terribly deep, just a funny, funny story about a slightly goofy girl's search for love.  If I was really just the second-last person in the world to read this book...seriously, what are you waiting for?
B00006690G|3.0|Eminem started rapping in the underground circuit back in 1995.

B00000AFHM|3.0|The Boy With the Arab Strap starts out so strongly that by the end of track two, you'll probably find yourself wondering whether Belle and Sebastian are in the process of topping their astonishing release from the previous year, If You're Feeling Sinister.  However, by the time \\"Is It Wicked Not To Care?\\" and \\"Ease Your Feet in the Sea\\" are through, you'll feel a bit ashamed for having even mentioned TBWTAS and IYFS in the same breath just minutes earlier.  Sadly, in an effort to diversify their sound on TBWTAS, Belle and Sebastian eschew the consistent songwriting skills they displayed so memorably on their previous album.  Every so often on TBWTAS, there's a track that reminds you just how great this band can be - that is, if you can resist the urge to reach for the stop button during snoozers like \\"Seymour Stein\\" and \\"A Space Boy Dream\\".  <br />Maybe the best strategy to adopt when listening to TBWTAS is to enjoy \\"It Could Have Been a Brilliant Career\\" and the incomparable \\"Sleep the Clock Around\\" then nap until \\"Dirty Day Dream Number Two\\" when things get brilliant again.  Stay awake through \\"The Boy With the Arab Strap\\" which you are also likely to enjoy.  Then, try to keep your ears open through the dull \\"Chickfactor\\" just so that you'll be rewarded with the superb, but brief, \\"Simple Things\\".  No question, Belle and Sebastian still have it.  Sadly, they just can't maintain it - the closing track, \\"The Rollercoaster Ride\\", clocks in at nearly 7-minutes and is guaranteed to induce slumber in even the most habitual of insomniacs.  <br />The handful of excellent songs on TBWTAS would warrant labeling this album as promising if it hadn't followed on the heels of a masterpiece like If You're Feeling Sinister.  Instead, TBWTAS is nothing if not disappointing.  Hey, that's what Belle and Sebastian get for setting the bar so high with their previous effort.  After requiring over a year to get over my initial disappointment, I came to accept TBWTAS for what it is - analbum composed of 5 brilliant tracks and 7 average-to-dull ones.  If that ratio is good enough for you - and it will be for most Belle and Sebastian fans - then go ahead and purchase it.

B00003CXXP|5.0|Once in a while a movie comes along that connects with the longings in your soul. A.I. is such a movie. Like some other reviewers here, I was sworn off this movie by friends who had seen it before me and hated it. That aroused my curiosity enough to see it for myself.<BR>It blew me away. It succeeded in pleasing me on so many levels: the story of a boy's longing to be loved, his epic adventures, the questions about life - real and artificial, the casting and excellent acting, and the thrilling special effects.<BR>I can't believe the vindictiveness against Steven Spielberg I have seen among these reviews. What's your problem, people?! He truly is a master storyteller of the visual medium. So many of his films have become beloved classics, even when the Academy snobs have ignored his work, as with the magnificent Amistad.<BR>At the time of A.I.'s release, professional film critics seemed to dwell on the collaboration between Spielberg and Kubrick in the making of this movie, as though that defined the film. They said Spielberg's optimism and lighter tone was tempered by Kubrick's cynicism, or the other way around. Granted, I imagine Spielberg honored the late Kubrick's vision, but he himself has not shied away from presenting the world in its ugliness, as with the heart-wrenching Schindler's List.<BR>Other than musings about Kubrick and Spielberg's genius, and the long-time sci-fi love affair with robots that think and feel, A.I. offers us other lessons to consider: the treatment of children as possessions to adore or discard as we see fit (the robot David represents all unwanted children); and the longing all of us have to be whole and to be loved.<BR>William Hurt's character brings up the question of God at the beginning of the film. He responds to a question about the ethics of creating robots that feel emotion by recalling Genesis: &quot;Why did God create Adam?&quot; he asks. Answering his own question, he says, &quot;To love him,&quot; meaning the love God expected from Adam, and by extension the rationale for creating robots that love us. That's only half-true. God also created Adam because God wanted to love Adam. As selfish humans, David's creator and David's sometime mother failed to return the love they expected from David.<BR>Don't look for a typical sappy happy ending here. This film is more Grimm's Fairy Tales than Disney. It's closer to the original Hans Christian Anderson Little Mermaid than the Disney version. It expresses longings that we know will not be fulfilled in this life.

B00003CXC6|4.0|The word \\"Rashomon\\" has long become a must-have-and-used word in the Orient as to interpretate the very same thing by different person with different point of views. The word \\"Rashomon\\", in modern days in America, can be used to explain how the Republican and the Democratic Parties to view and pitch or approach any agenda so differently such as Tax Cut, Health Care, Social Security, Foreign Policy, National Defense(oh, shall I say, the newly popularated \\"Homeland Security\\" by the Republican government?). The word \\"Rashomon\\" can also be miserably used to explain why the Islamic people hate the Jews or Americans, but we Jews or Americans never hate anybody but themselves when watching a NFL or NBA game won by the teams they never like or support enough to buy their merchandise. The word \\"Rashomon\\" only tell us, there always some other different explanations or views by different persons, in different ages, sex, moods, or in different time frames. Nothing is absolutely right or wrong, only depend upon where, how, why you choose to stand. The word \\"Rashomon\\" is a too deep philosophic word, yet a word you should grap at a certain moment or certain time to remind you and all of us, always leave some room or space to yourself and others, your world is sometime not the exactly world other people live in. Your very own birthday is already long past 24 hours earlier in the Far East, 3 hours ago in the East Coast, 2 hours ago in Central region. Even almost every single track house looks alike to the next or around, the furniture in each house is never the same. \\"Rashomon\\" is also the word to remind you how important the word \\"Tolerance\\" is.
B000069KGM|5.0|Ok, Listen up. Chicago Transit Authority is an awesome addition to anyone's musical catalog- those who like extremely well written, well arranged, powerful music. I &quot;discovered&quot; this album when looking through my parents music collection around age 15. The album jacket was worn but the talent within the music itself can never ever wear out. Question 67 &amp; 68, Beginnings, and Someday are my favorites. Of course, &quot; old-schoolers&quot; also love Does Anybody Really Know What Time It Is?<br />Here's the problem. I'm tired of hearing so many &quot;old-schoolers&quot; complain that later Chicago (80's ballads)can't contend. For those of you that I'm talking to, yes the early works are great. And because they are something of a first (in style and creativeness of the music at that time)they maybe greater due to their epic appeal. But don't knock the 80's Chicago (Chi 16 &amp; 17 etc. )because it also demonstrates why Chicago, the band is so great. This is largely because, within the 80's material, you can still feel the heart of the band and their triumphant horn arrangement style that no other band then or now could ever duplicate. Remember, it's their 80's material and particularly Peter Cetera, that caught my, and many within my generation's attention. Lastly, it is this interest that started my pursuit of listening and enjoying most of Chicago's music throughout all of their years. The time periods change, so does Chicago's music. It's simply different, yet still amazingly powerful and still distinctly- Chicago.
B000002H33|5.0|Quite simply the Best metal album ever. The only album that comes close is Ride The Lightning.
B00003CXRM|5.0|I approached the DVD with reservation. My friend said that it was his wife's favorite movie and they had watched the DVD so many times that now he had begun to like it a lot too. I got a copy and was caught up in the story right away. The cast of characters are almost cartoon-like in their simplicity but the actors play them with energy and creativity. Clooney's star power comes through but he doesn't dominate the film. Instead, he come across exactly as he should - as a man who has survived on his charm and not his wits. The masterful way the music is used as a unifying force worked very well for me (I bought the CD as well). Without the outstanding music score, the movie would not have been as appealing. It is making the rounds on cable these days and when I scan past it, I hang in there for a while because the acting is so good and each scene is photographed beautifully. Maybe not a film for everyone, but it works just fine for me.
B00005B36H|5.0|Good CD, Lots of music. The Lyrics are a little out there. The Guitar is definately used effectivly in this score. I suggest this CD to anyone. Good music, Not to much metal. Just right.
0316666343|5.0|This book is difficult to read if you have children. It also reminds those who do have children that life does have to go on regardless of what happensm  during a lifetime. The read was enjoyable because the story was believable and told from the perspective of a young adult. It was interesting to see the lives of the characters unfolding and frustrating because of the way  it ended for the killer. This is worth the short amount of time it took to finish the book.
B00005A46T|1.0|I gave a pretty liberal-soft opinion of this album when I first reviewed it. But the other day I was thumbing through one of my CD Books and decided to give this one a listen just because I haven't in so long. I then released that this was a bad CD, Almost every song on here is quit honestly the worst musicianship I've ever seen. It sounds like Corey Taylor and his masked buds went out in the woods and recorded a grizzly bear attacking some yack, Then put in a one chord thump with the distortion so high you cant tell what is going on. Give \\"People=Shit\\" a listen, You will see what I mean. For about two minutes you dont even know whats going on. <br />My honest opinion is the only reason people listen is that its the anthem for a false sub-culture(the goths) the only band they can really call their own. Thats the only way these losers will ever sell another CD.
B000006TRV|5.0|This is with out a doubt the greatest rock album of all time.  The only piece of music that it can be compaired to is anything by Beethoven.  With intricate placing of strings, guitars, vocals, and bass work, this is the closest thing that rock has to a symphony.  It is a masterwork that any decent person would kill to write.  All works of the Beatles, the Rolling Stones, even Led Zeppelin do not even come close to the beauty of this album.  This album has changed many lives, and caused many musicians to devote their lives to trying to make a work like this.  All should hear this and let the music and the message of not to build wall enter their minds and free them of the crap the world has ordered them to believe.  Bravo Pink Floyd, and thank you.
B00000I2UC|4.0|with pleasant results! While I was offended by the cleanliness and comparative tameness of Automatic when it first arrived, twelve years later, it sounds like a towering pop album that shoulda ranked high on 'best of' lists in 89. The Chain could always write good songs that were listenable, even during the \\"Psychocandy\\" years-they just chose to wrap it all in torturous feedback and LSD freakouts. Here, they drop the drugs and opt for the jaded love songs. This album feels good, very summery, certainly a happy aberration for the disturbed Reid brothers.
B00005U122|5.0|a stunning achievement. Here is the real genius behind the magic of Pink Floyd combining the best from those days with selections from his solo material. Backed by wonderful vocalists and musicians who complement him nicely, Waters brings new life to historically great songs. He manages to capture the essence of Floyd without the others. I find this material so much more entertaining than the other incarnation. Long live Roger Waters!
B00005B36H|5.0|I'm simply addicted to these guys. I can't take either Lateralus or Aenima out of my CD player (nor can I decide which is better). This stuff is the opposite of pop music: the first few times you hear Tool it may be hard to appreciate, but it will soon grow on you and eventually take a firm hold. And while Tool rocks, it's interesting and it doesn't get tiresome like almost all of the heavy metal out there.<br />I just wish there were another band out there right now that I liked half as much. If any other Tool fans out there have any thoughts, please post them.
B00006CXXU|5.0|There is no other way to describe this album than a masterpiece. It truly is the finest album released in 2002 and probably one of the finest in the last ten years. I think those who criticize Christina Aguilera's sexy singles and the revealing cover photograph misunderstand a lot of what this album is trying to say. Be who you are. If you want to be sexy, Christina, go for it. At least you aren't afraid to be your true self among all those who are truly lost. And Christina writes of those who are lost in these songs, comparing them to dreamers who are \\"Brought down\\" by hurtful words. Anyone who has seen the video for \\"Beautiful\\" will agree. It is a triumph. Here we see something that should have been showed to the world long ago...a gay couple who actually love each other, and an assortment of people who are most happy as individuals, which is what makes them all beautiful. The album is at times tragic, uplifting, inspiring, but always, always Beautiful, just like Christina Aguilera is...from the inside out.  Her voice and her heart are a gift to us all.
B000002ACR|5.0|All of the other 5-star reviewers have already said all that really needs to be said about this incredible album, so I won't waste your time repeating them.  But I'd like to make a quick comment on &quot;Mind Gardens,&quot; which most reviewers (including myself) tend to skip over when listening to this CD.  The album version is pretty unbearable, with a very obnoxious, atonal, experimental melody and dated trippy-dippy lyrics.  But lo and behold!  The alternate version of this song (track 15) is actually quite a bit more melodic, and lacking in a lot of the wild turns of melody. (Just listen, for instance, to the opening &quot;Once upon a time&quot;  line in both versions of the song.  The alternate version's choice of the note for the word &quot;time&quot; is better.)  It is less harsh, more smooth-sounding and mysterious, and, well, actually listenable.<br />It's still not my favorite song on the album, even in its alternate version, but I'm glad they included that version on the album.  And the rest of the album is just peerless.  5 stars all the way.
B00005YW4H|5.0|I BECAME AWARE OF THIS CD WHEN A CO-WORKER BROUGHT IT IN.  WE LISTEN TO AND ENJOY EACH TRACK OVER AND OVER AGAIN!  NORAH'S MUSIC IS A REFRESHING CHANGE FROM THE &quot;USUAL&quot; POP MUSIC OF ARTISTS HER AGE.  I LOOK FORWARD TO HER NEXT CD!
B0000640VM|5.0|One of my Disney favourites.  My children liked it the most of any of the Disney movies we have seen.  The music is jazzy and the tunes are catchy. The casting of the different dog breeds is fun and imaginitive -  Bette Midler as a spoiled show poodle is priceless!  Well worth having in your collection, especially if you are a dog OR cat lover.  Not many movies can say that.
B000005JA8|1.0|The first album I ever bought that actually left a bad taste in my mouth!  I'm going to have bad dreams, I think.  The UGLIEST music I've ever heard - like someone clubbing baby seals, but with bad rhythym.  I wish I could get a refund on the time I spent listening to this.
B000065FWT|5.0|and before digital, there was Willow.  It is unfortunate that it was not popular enough in its day to warrant some updating of the special effects, but the story is a classic, feel good, good-vs-evil, size-isn't-everything movie.  This is Val Kilmer's most charming role and the chemistry between him and Joanne Whalley was (at the time this movie was made) electric.  Romantic, swashbuckling, good-humoured, lots of action without overly graphic gore ... good family viewing!
0316666343|2.0|If you want to cry and like seeing other people in anguish and pain, this is a book for you. I'm not sure why this is such a popular book? A wrenching murder and then the painful aftermath are studied in great detail. This isn't an experience I would wish for anyone, so why do we need to read about it? I guess I was expecting something more based on the book's popularity. Probably it's my fault. High expectations often create a difficult hurdle for an author to overcome. I hope others found some solace or value in this. It was just a difficult downer for me.
B000066NW0|4.0|I first thought that Avril Lavigne would just be another pop star, but I guess her image made me change my mind.  There's something for all on this album - I'm a big Alanis Morrisette fan and some of the tracks really reflect her great voice and talent.  Mine, particuarly, is I'm with you, it's a beautiful song.  Don't be put off by any ther comments you recieve on this album - it's great!
B00006AW2M|5.0|Great Album. Good songs include: She's a Rainbow, In Another Land, 2,000 Man, and On With the Show. The others aren't that bad, either. A fine album I would not hesitate buying.
B00006RU5B|4.0|Over the last few years us Hard Rock fans have not had much to get excited about. Finally someone has put an CD out that rocks. This is Chris Cornell from Soundgarden on Vocals and Tim Commerford on Bass, Tom Morello on Guitar and Brad Wilk on Drums all three were members of Rage against the machine. The CD rocks from start to finish, the lyrics are good, and the songs are intresting enought to keep one listening to the whoke CD. I like Tom Morello's licks as well, he has his own style, for sure. I like all the songs and Cohise, Gasoline, Like A stone, I Am The Highway and Exploder stand out.
B00000I01A|4.0|The only problem I have with the CD is that they tampered with 3 of the main songs, the Training Montage, if you know from the movie, it changes in the begginning.  In Heart's on Fire, the didn't to the instrumental at the end and finally in the song war, which was great in the movie, was not that great on the soundtrack.  They did about 45 seconds of just a piano in it and the movie was just better.  If anyone has the exact movie version of those 3 songs, please e-mail me ...[and]I will be forever greatful.  Other than that, the soundtrack, like the movie....rocked.  No Easy Way Out, great, great song, and if you notice, that most of the Rocky 4 soundtrack is on the Rock Story.
B0000797IO|5.0|This truly is a great film and so much fun.  It is quite introspective and moving. Though it deals with some serious and real issues, it is not a depressing film because it never fails to be hilarious. It is a heartfelt and very funny look at life. It will hit home with anyone who has ever felt &quot;trapped&quot; in their daily existence. Life at the &quot;Retail Rodeo&quot; is too funny for words.  The filmmakers captured the spirit of a typical small town retail store so perfectly.<br />Jennifer Aniston reached new heights with her performance in 1998's &quot;The Object of My Affection&quot; and with this, her latest film &quot;The Good Girl&quot;, she tops it.  She's a natural and very talented actress.  Her performance is very humorous and touching. The rest of cast is superb as well. Jake Gyllenhaal plays the troubled young man with depth and priceless comedy, and John C. Reilly as Aniston's husband gives a rich and endearing portrayal. This movie is filled with lines that you will be quoting and laughing over for a long time to come. I highly recommend it.
B00000JCOV|5.0|I think this second  selftitle album by slipknot is pretty impressive, specialy songs like &quot;sic&quot;, &quot;eyeless&quot;, &quot;liberate&quot;, &quot;spit it out&quot; and, my all time favorite &quot;surfacing&quot;... I must admit that seeing slipknot perform &quot;wait and bleed&quot; in ozzfest made me kinda obsse with this guys. I never  told any one that before (laughs). Whenever, i hear that song &quot;sic&quot; i always feel sort of like  im listining to an disfunctionial nu-metal/deathmetal mix and i love it ! Buy it. k.m.r. slipknot's debut still the best one of all ! Suppert the guys from slipknot, they deserv it!
B000067CPX|5.0|This is the best cd I've heard all year! I love almost every song. I think out of all their cds this one is the best. It's not as hardcore as some of their older stuff. In fact most of the songs on this cd are mellow and laid back.But all in all it's a great cd. It's definitly worth a listen.<br />The best songs are: Can't stop, Tear, Dosed, Cabron,and Universally speaking
B00006SFBD|5.0|The new full-lenght by opeth is original, just like all of their other records... Thats what makes me be proud to be their fan. I dont need to express any more. Bye !
B000050XXO|1.0|I was also peeved by the lack of details about this \\"Collector's Set\\", so I went hunting.<br />Bottom line:  Unles you want lobby cards, 8X10 stills, and a few other \\"collectables\\", save your money.  The DVD itself in the \\"Collector's Set\\" appears to be identical to the DVD in the original release.  Based on other vendors' sites, here's what you get for the extra money:<br />- Lobby Cards: 8 Original limited edition lobby card prints.<BR>- Senitype: Exclusive limited edition senitype® image from movie with 35mm film frame.<BR>- Theatrical Poster: Original one sheet movie poster (27 x 40 ).<BR>- Exclusive Collection: 6 Original Limited Edition B & W Photograph Stills.<br />Information regarding the DVD in the \\"Collector's Set\\" is:<BR>DVD CONTAINS:<BR>- Digitally restored image and cleaned soundtrack.<BR>- Theatrical trailers.<BR>- YOU MUST REMEBER THIS, a 36-minute documentary newly updated with recently discovered, unseen outakes and screen tests.<BR>- Special introduction by screen legend Lauren Bacall, wife of Humphrey Bogart.<br />I didn't see any new DVD features on any site.<br />This is one of the greatest films ever made, but the \\"extras\\" aren't worth the extra $... to me.  I'll gladly take the original release, which should be in everyone's DVD library!!
B0000584V3|5.0|Blackwaterpark is another masterpiece done by this great band we all know as opeth.  I have to say my most favorite song on here is dirge november... I love the acoustic in the begining and then the melodic romentic guitar sound afterwards. A truly beatifull well-done slow romentic sound by this inteligent band. Opeth needs to be respected by every one not only in the metal scene but also in the classical music scene. Their music is very much classical,  as well as metal. Support opeth !
B000002VMD|5.0|this is still one of the best soundtracks ever made and if you love whitney houston you gotta cop this some of hewr best tunes here including the dolly parton remake I'll always love you and the chaka khan remake I'm every woman yes 1992 was a good year.
B00005A46T|5.0|Slipknot's third album isnt bad at all. I actullie  i like this alot, but i still think that the first is much more superior then &quot; iowa&quot;... Don't get me wrong this is  pretty god. Buy it !
B000055XMF|4.0|great dvd ...sound and picture are better quality than the uk version...but film freezes for a split second when jim and steph come out of the alley way.some scenes are missing but it does not spoil the film.<BR>worth buying for the extras alone...glad i bought this dvd..i now have both versions and both good in there own right.
B00005JKDR|5.0|This is a great Movie My Favorite Part is when is sullaman say if ure going to threten me do it properly And the Musical play is funny also
B00006CXXU|5.0|This is THE BEST POP/ R&B EVER!!. Doesn´t matter you dislike POP, or even if you do not like Christina´s style this album is really worthy.<BR> <BR>  You can´t denny this is THE BEST EVER, not only because of its unique, marvellous and supreme lyrics, but cause of its SUPREME BEAT included in each song. You´ve probably heard \\"DIRRTY\\", well, need to say that \\"DIRRTY\\" is the less worthy song of the album. I specially recommend you the songs \\"BEAUTIFUL\\", \\"CAN´T HOLD US DOWN\\" & \\"I´M OK\\".<br />  1. Stripped intro: nice intro, nothing out of this world. 8/10.<BR>  <BR>  2. Can´t Hold us Down (feat Lil Kim): Amazing, R&B/ RAP/ POP song. Catchy one. 10/10.<BR> <BR>  3. Walk Away: R&B/ BLUES/ POP BALLAD song. Nice lyrics. 9/10.<br />  4. Fighter: Cool song, good beat. ROCK/ POP song. 8.7/10.<br />  5. Infatuation Interlude: Short speach by Christina, she talks about how she met the bloke of the song Infatuation. Not bad, try to listen to the guitar playing, cool. It is just like the intro. 8/10.<br />  6. Infatuation: Wow, if you liked Christina´s latin like style, then this song will rock for you!!!. Nice and intelligent lyrics, all by Christina!!!. She talks about a rommance with a Puerto Rican bloke. LATIN POP/ R&B song. Really good to dance. Cool beat. 9.5/10.<br />  7. Loving me 4 me (interlude): it is exactly the same kind of interlude of infatuation, this one is more a POP song interlude. Really simple (THE BEAT), but this one has the best lyrics both the interlude and the song!!. 8.5/10.<br />  8. Loving me 4 me: This one has a really POPpish beat, really simple, as simple as Britney Spears´ music, yet this one has cool lyrics. Check them. 9/10.<br />  9. Impossible: (ALICIA KEYS!!) I´ve heard lots of crytics about this song, some say that Christina rocks with Alicia playing the piano, some others say that she was searching for popularity. Which of the 2 you take???, Doesn´t matter, because Christina rocks!!!!!. R&B / BLUES song. 10/10.<br />  10. Underappreciated: THis song sounds like a 70s R&B song. Pretty cool. Yet it sounds a little bit like the earlier song. It really doesn´t matter, the only thing in common the 2 songs have, is the beat, nothing else. Check the lyrics. 9/10.<br />  11. Beautiful: Her newest single. Love the song, the video not at all. This song has the best lyrics of all POP Ballads ever. This song is kind of a mixture: POP BALLAD/ R&B/ kinda GOSPELL song. 10/10.<br />  12. Make Over: What a beat!!. This song, has cool lyrics. Spanish (FLAMENCO) like sound. POP / ROCK song. Check Christina´s voice on this one!!!!. 10/10. <br />  13. Cruz: A nice ballad, good sound, nice lyrics. Nothing out of this world, yet amazing. Christina´s style is more R&B than POP this days, that rocks!!. 10/10-<br />  14. Soar: The 3rd best ballad of the album, right after The Voice Within and Beautiful, in ballads obviously. Really intelligent and more than average lyrics. Cool beat. POP BALLAD/ R&B. 10/10.<br />  15. Get mine, Get yours: Catchy beat, nice song, above average. I recommend you Infatuation, Can´t Hold us down or Dirrty with this ones. Those songs are dance for songs. Nice lyrics. 9/10.<br />  16. Dirrty (feat. Redman): The best beat of the album, nothing to see with her earlier works, amazing, simply lyrics, but both her singing style and her personality included in this song make this one a MUST for every POP / R&B / RAP like songs. 9/10.<br />  17. Stripped Pt. 2: This could have been Christina´s best song ever!!. The best beat right after Dirrty, amazing lyrics. The only problem is that this song is only 60 seconds or a little bit more long. Really worthy to listen right after listenning Dirrty. 10/10.<br /> 18. The Voice Within: CHRISTINA´S BEST BALLAD UP TO NOW. A kind of GOSLPELL LIKE/ R&B/ POP BALLAD like song. She really rocks!!!. Excellent lyrics, must not miss this one.  If you liked DESTINY CHILD´S \\"EMOTION\\" then you are going to love this one. 10/10.<br /> 19. I´M OK: Well people, there are some songs in which the artist reaches her maximum in quality, style, singing and everything. THIS IS CHRISTINA´S BEST SONG EVER, YOU CAN´T COMPARE IT WITH ANY OTHER SONG OF ANY OTHER ARTIST, BRITNEY WILL CRY AFTER LISTENNING TO THIS ONE, YOU WILL TOO. Amazing, that´s all. POP / R&B/ ROCK BALLAD song. SUPREME!!.  20/10. (I am not wrong this song really deserves 20 of 10).<br />  20. Singing my song: Christina enters to the GOSPELL´s arena, good song, above average, cool lyrics. 9.5/10.<br />  PROBABLY ONCE YOU`VE FINISHED LISTENING TO THIS ALBUM AND IF YOU WERE A BRITNEY´S FAN THEN YOU WILL HATE BRIT´S MUSIC AND LOVE CHRISTINA FOREVER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!.<br />  You can´t compare here to any one. The best POP/ R&B album sinc OFF THE WALL & THRILLER.<br />  MUST CHECK THIS ONE!!!.
B000002NIW|2.0|Along with Tool i think this band is really overated. The distortion is so thick on this album you can barely tell any of the instruments apart. It's like a big wall of fuzz with the occasional snap of a snare drum. Chino Moreno is such an awful vocalist, he can't sing and his screaming is so forced and weak. I'll give it 2 stars since i only give 1 star to truly worthless albums that deserve it, and i guess &quot;Be Quiet and Drive&quot; is an enjoyable emo-ish song. I recommed you listen to the bands who influenced the deftones such as Helmet, Bad Brains, Faith no more and Sick of it all.
B000002JOH|5.0|this CD is true, from-the-gut pure anger and brooding.  It makes music these days look like themes from sappy disnee movies.  A MUST-HAVE METAL CD.  PERIOD.
B00000JLWW|2.0|I admit, the movie sucked me in somewhat. It tore my heart when Jack fell under. I felt I was really there watching all those people drown. I was scared. I admit, I would have cried if it was not for the man next to me, whose presence reminded me I was a man. <br />This movie has to be something if it was able to suck me in so much. So it gets two stars, for sucking! I am kidding. It was engrossing and, in that respect, good. <br />But what a horrible film! What depression and horror! What terrifying action near the end! . . . Fellow reviewers and surfers, I ask you -- and be honest -- what makes this horror worth watching? When a film tells you: I am about death and misery; at my end most of the people you have seen die; I am, moreover, three hours long, three hours of which you already know; that is, you know I am about misery and death, and that my first two hours are there to make you feel more anguish at my end. . . . Why Watch! Why admire this monster! Why look at misery and applaud it! You are praising bad art, gentlemen . . . and ladies. . . . There are heroes, you say. Yes, indeed there are -- ones with violins in fact -- but not enough. Our heroes die in the water. We are left with an old woman.
B000002JNJ|4.0|Cemetery Gates is the best song on this CD, but the others are not all that bad.  Phil seems to have lost some of his anger that he displayed in the aforementioned CD.  A good CD to blast during rush hour on the Q-Bridge.
B00005J6UP|5.0|I notice that a lot of young viewers have rated this film, which is GREAT! But, I want to underscore the point that this is a fantastic movie for adults too! I first saw this movie when I was twenty years old, and now at thirty-six years of age I own the DVD and return to it regularly with relish. And when I am old and gray, sucking my dinner through a straw in a convalescent hospital, THIS is the movie I want them to play for me! Even as an adult, if you have just an ounce of a kid's imagination left in you, you will fall for this film head over heels!
B0000797IO|5.0|I honestly went into seeing this film with the idea that it would be just another Jennifer Anniston popularity boost disguised as an indie flick. I was wrong. This film addresses normally nearly taboo unspoken universal feelings many women have about feeling stuck in life situations they did not perceive at an earlier age. Anniston conveys her character's feelings of despair and ennui so well that I found myself reevaluating my opinion of her as an actress. I have not been so pleasantly surprised by a film, or an actress, in a long time. She held her own with John C. Reilly. The film brought to mind Ashley Judd's &quot;Ruby In Paradise,&quot; another film I would recommend to anyone who appreciated the thought provoking themes brought out in this particular film about women feeling trapped in their station in life.
B000066NW0|5.0|About Avril and her music, one generally hears two extremes (and lots in between). Some believe that she's a brilliant, talented, anti-Britney skater-punk queen, while others declare that she's a prepackaged phoney designed by a bunch of record company executives, marketed for teenyboppers riding the trend of prepackaged, sterilized neo-punk for posers.<br />There's some truth to both of these extremes, but ultimately I'm giving Avril five stars; I firmly believe that, at the heart of the matter, her songs are high quality and that she is very promising as an artist. Her image, on the other hand, undeniably doesn't quite fit and needs to be fixed.<br />AVRIL THE SKATER-PUNK?<BR>I can believe that Avril's image derives at least somewhat from her real personality -- she was always a self-described tomboy in her hometown of Napanee -- but she rather self-consciously takes the image to an extreme which really doesn't fit her music style.<br />I respect this image to a point: it's hard to deny that she's anti-Britney in her looks, her clothes, her lyrics. But, as anyone who honestly listens to her music can see, she strains to maintain this image. Her music is not real punk, and I think she must realize that if she intends to go any further. I have no problem with Avril, but it makes me cringe to see young teens  blasting her music and wearing neckties over tank tops, believing that this idolization makes them non-conformist rebels to society. (Then again, I was also like that as a teenager. :-P)<br />...BUT HOW IS HER MUSIC?<BR>Avril's music is high-quality, solid stuff. Her refreshingly honest lyrics will resonate with many of us who have walked the line between feeling accepted and rejected, loved and hated, comfortable and out of place. Her tunes are beautiful, and her voice is highly expressive and technically refined. If you've heard songs like &quot;Sk8er Boi&quot; and &quot;Complicated&quot; waaaay too many times, rest assured that there are many fresh, high-quality songs on this album. &quot;Naked&quot; is a pleasantly un-syrupy love song that's emotional without being melodramatic. The lyrics of &quot;My World&quot; may not burst with Bob Dylan-esque profundity, but they work well at giving you a glimpse of Avril's life -- her thoughts, her dreams, her unanswered questions. &quot;Losing Grip&quot; and &quot;Unwanted&quot; are more in the style of rock than most of Avril's other offerings, adding variety to the mix.<br />Avril's music is limited by her experience. That shouldn't be too much of a concern: as Avril grows as a person, so will her music. &quot;Let Go&quot; is a smashing album as it stands, but I firmly believe Avril's best stuff has yet to come.<br />CONCLUSION<BR>If you're looking for rebellion, look elsewhere. If you're looking for more mature stuff in a similar style, try Blondie. But if you're looking for the debut album of a promising young artist with a lot on her mind, Avril Lavigne's &quot;Let Go&quot; will not disappoint you.
B00005OAIE|5.0|Being a poor student, I am hesitant to put out cash on a relatively untested artist.  After all, the one or two tracks on the radio might be great, but what if all of the rest of the songs suck?  I gave John a chance, and I am so glad I did.  Into almost every song, he has put so much thoughtful effort, and it translates into one of those CDs you will play incessantly in your car for months.  This album will appeal especially to those of us who are just venturing out into the world on our own, as John manages to poignantly capture the confusing and exciting experiences of becoming an adult (i.e. a \\"quarter-life crisis\\" as he puts it).  Any age group, though, will be impressed with his musical skill and the fresh mix of styles that he incorporates into this consistently pleasing CD.

B00003W8NM|5.0|First things first:  You probably didn't understand this movie.  David Fincher makes dark films that toss muddled characters together and Fate spins the wheel.  Centrifugal force takes over.  Don't get me wrong.  The plot holds to logical conventions, reality may be stretched, but the otherworldiness of 'Seven', for example, shot in a dreary, nameless city, doesn't overly tax credibility.  In \\"Fight Club\\" the idea that Tyler and 'Jack' could spearhead a global movement of disaffected men with a penchant for thumping each other into senselessness, while a bit silly, isn't impossible to believe, given how men engage in the sorting out of the pecking order normally.  Anyone who has watched 4 year old boys in a sandbox knows that aggression determines who keeps the shovel.<br />But the movie is not about the Social Learning Theory of aggressive behavior.  It's about how we arrive at what is worth fighting for, about emotional connectedness, about how we integrate conflicting agenda items into our consciousness.  You can say all you want about the likeability of the characters.  Personally, I wouldn't trust Marla or Jack or Tyler for a minute, but each character is playing out a role that typifies a point on everyones psychological map.  Jack is in Siberia, in a consumerist gulag that has him prisoner to the Ikea catalog.  Marla, though plenty attractive, is so damaged by life that she wanders from one self-help meeting to another ( as does Jack ), hoping to heal her invisible psychic wounds.  Tyler is a glib, self-made philosopher/soap salesman whose motives seem to be mostly iconoclastic.  The perfect trio.<br />What happens in this film occurs because each character is impelled to pursue a fated role, not because he or she wants the inevitable outcome, but because each choice narrows the succeeding choices.  In such a nihilist universe, love is destructive, not redeeming.  I don't think this movie is enjoyable in conventional terms; it is abrupt, dangerous, eccentricas well as ironic and a little creepy.  Given that caveat, it succeeds as entertainment because it doesn't try to entertain.
B00006LPER|5.0|Although for the most part I enjoyed this film I have to admit that the utterly continental French ending leaving the audience to wonder what in the world happened and really left me cold with a feeling that I had fallen off a cliff or was cheated .... <br />In this movie we find our single 30'ish piano teacher extraordinaire living with her mother in modern day Paris with her domineering mother ..... Since both of them sleep together, in an apartment that we find does have more than one bedroom, the viewer is on more than one accasion treated to observe a violent and disturbing relationship between mother and daughter from the get go ...<br />To say that our heroine sufferes from sexual repression pushing her to madness we see perversion come to the light of day when she is openly courted by one of her younger students who could have practically any girl his own age for the sheer asking ..... The students admission of love for his teacher forces her to face up to her repressed sexual urges and fetishes, which, in turn are initially rebuffed as madness ..... <br />Although we hope that this young woman would be able to overcome her obsessions there is always a feeling within the viewers mind that this tragedy will not end well..... <br />Definitely for the mature viewers among us ....
B00000JGHM|3.0|I am a big fan of Michael Mann.  In Manhunter, he took his Miami Vice palette and painted a psychological thriller the equal of some of Hitchcock's work, not in the same style, of course, but with the tension and nuance of the master.  Here, he is stuck with phenomenal stars, Pacino and De Niro, and they don't pull off the heist, that is, they don't steal the show or even work well together.  The result is a crime drama that has more glitz than excitement, more form than substance.<br />I didn't care one whit about any character in this film, except Pacino's wife, and I can't figure out why she would stick it out for ten weeks with this guy, let alone ten years.<br />Val Kilmer is the doomed partner of De Niro, and at least he is so pathetic that you have some grudging sympathy for him, but in the end he's just another thief who gets his due.<br />I can't say this is a bad film, just not a particularly good one, especially in light of the resources at Mann's disposal.

B0000640VN|3.0|To put it simply, this is a love version of &quot;Back to the Future&quot;.  Instead of concentrating upon the technicality of bringing people from the past to the future, and vice versa, this movie devoids of the time travel sequence completely.  Perhaps, this would save cost upon the special effects.  Hugh &amp; Meg are likeable characters, and it's hard not to vouch for them to fall in love with one another.  In some ways, this movie is kind of ironic when Meg's character is a researcher, getting feedbacks from the general public to produce movies, ads that the mass public would accept.  This movie is no different from that, stick to the premise of the Prince sweeping the Princess off her feet and living happily ever after.  The gags about Hugh's character getting used to the contemporary setting is funny but forceful.  I'm sure that after a while, it wears thin.  This is not really a bad movie, but it's simply too well-rehearsed and too predictable.  Sting music is worth mentioning too.  Recommended for a rainy day.
0800141849|5.0|I've never been a big fan of Barbra's, but in this movie I love her! She's wry and funny and I think she's got great chemistry with Jeff Bridges. <br />You truly wonder how Greg (Bridges) feels about her.  There's a great \\"seduction\\" scene where the chemistry and passion are obvious.  I'll leave it at that.  <br />There are a lot of humorous scenes and it kept me in giggles (wry wit, awkward situations, etc.).  I LOVE IT!<br />As for reviewer who didn't like the Rose improvement: so what? Rose learns she IS beautiful...she just never tried to show it off.  She earned the right to show it off. Babs is great in this movie.
1573226521|4.0|Alex Garland's first novel takes a look at 20-something backpackers in Southeast Asia fighting to get off the beaten trail to find the ultimate real 'something' that cannot be found among pop culture-stained modern civilization .  The story follows the first person narrative of Richard as he stumbles upon a hidden utopia on a remote island of Thailand and what he discovers while living there.<br />This book was fantastically written - there is a nice balance of compelling plot and insightful commentary, so on one hand, you don't feel as if you are reading one-dimensional mindless [stuff], and on the other, it doesn't feel heavy-handed.  Garland does a terrific job at developing the ecclectic mix of characters, and he writes from the heart, from experience, so the dialogue and places are real.  Though the book itself is pop culture incarnate, it rises above the other English novels of its kind, as it introduces many questions never brought up before.  I wish there were more types of these books written - on backpacker culture, the motivations behind travel, the discoveries revealed from it, and the unending search for that something, whatever It is.  But I suppose if there were other books out there like this, this book would lose the quality that makes it so unique. <br />Another note - the book is so much better than the piece of garbage film.
B00006ZSAD|4.0|There's a reason that critics were immediately hailing this as one of the year's best.  Although the driving beats of Portishead's radio singles are missing (along with the DJ flourishes), the sound is not at all unexpected from Beth Gibbons.  In fact, this could very well be a new Portishead album with a little twist.  Not that I mean to slight it in the least.  Luxurious vocals that recall both aspects of Gibbons' Portishead moods (including the occasional Shirley Bassey-esque turn of voice), sparse arrangements that ooze atmosphere, and dark-yet-hopeful romance.  A stunning album that's well worth the import price.  You can't dance to it, and it isn't built for raves, but it's not to be missed.<br />As an added bonus, it's hip enough to impress your friends, yet it won't cause the folks to demand you switch the music.
0694003611|5.0|Goodnight Moon is a timeless bedtime story that I still hold onto (I am 26).  This is one of the books that has become just as much a part of my childhood as was Sesame Street and Mr. Rogers.  Goodnight moon is the most clever yet simple childhood book -- it is entertaining for children of any generation -- I am holding onto my copy for when I have children, so that I can read it to them!  I still remember the last words of the book:...\\"goodnight air....goodnight noises everywhere.\\"  I recommend this book to anyone who likes to read bedtime stories -- the pictures and the words are soothing and entertaining to children!!
B00005OWIU|3.0|John Williams has managed to not produce any new music for over a deacade, but he still delights with what he does come up with - generic, entertaining, very true to form to whatever movie he is scoring. This CD is no exception to that rule.<BR>Listen to Harry Potter and you can catch snippets of Star Wars (especially in flying scenes), similarities to Edward Scissorhands (delicate chiming noises) and those ever-present strings that underscore whatever emotion he thinks the character can't convey with looks alone. (You'll find that in ALL of his stuff).<BR>The best part about this soundtrack is that there are no distracting tracks with words, so you can play it in the background and do other things like read or use it as inspiration ofr writing (mmm, mood music!)<BR>Guaranteed that the second track will sound just like this one, but that is not a bad thing either, now is it?
B00005JL96|5.0|I'm proud of Disney for making such a great movie.  I have no what-so-ever dislikes about it in any way...and I'm extremely tired of people bad mouthing this wonderful movie!  I've watched &quot;Lilo and Stitch&quot; over ten times and it gets better each and every time I view it.  It was the cutest movie I've seen in a long time, and because I liked it so much, I went out and bought the soundtrack.  Some people were disappointed about the quarrels and &quot;scary&quot; aliens, but the quarrels between Lilo and Nani were sisterly &quot;Must Haves,&quot;  and the aliens were the ones that put the climax in the movie.  If you are completely out of touch with reality and thought that this movie was bad, I suggest you view it again with a better point of view.  I also suggest Disney's &quot;Spirit,&quot;  because it's a magnificent movie too.  Way to go Disney!

Even when others say it isn't possible... one man did make it possible in the end.It makes you jump with joy to see the reward for perservience.In the end Rudy's father who did not believe in him at the beginning was the loudest supporter.

0312117337|5.0|I just received my new Osho Zen Tarot deck. I've only been reading tarot for about a year now, and have started collecting decks that inspire me, I have 5 now with Osho Zen. I am always checking out different decks and their reviews. Well purely by accident I came across this gorgeous deck and the few cards they did show, were enough to make me want this deck. The whole deck is absolutly beautiful. Each card represents so much, just by picture alone. This is not a traditional deck on the outside , it has different names for all the cards ie:(thunderbolt,break through,healing) and there is one extra card (79 cards) instead of the regular 78. In the info book it shows you that the deck is based on the the four suits for the minor arcana (clouds, fire, water, rainbows) and it has the major arcana cards as well ie: (beyond illusion, no-thingness) but looking at these cards alone you would not know this.<BR> If you are new to the tarot these cards may be tricky to read because of the modern feel to them,it would be wise to just make sure you know your basics first.<BR> But.... If you are looking to be truly inspired then this is the deck  for you, you won't be able to take your eyes off of them.
B00005JKZT|5.0|I just went and saw \\"The Lord of The Rings: The Two Towers\\" tonight, for the second time.. and it (not surprisingly) was even better than the previous time. The first installment of the trilogy was very impressive, but the second is just plain fun. Despite some drawn out points of the film, I never lost interest.. not even for a moment. The battle at 'Helm's Deep' was amazing. Throughout the entire movie (the 2nd time), I was so enthusiastic about that whole war sequence to begin. This movie has such imaginative characters, and such saturatingly deep development into the story; you'll leave the theater wishing the final movie was out already.
0375414053|4.0|In this novel, we go along for the ride as yet another woman discovers you can't have it all. We're not with an average working mother, though; Kate Reddy is a high-powered careerist who can relieve stress by buying designer shoes and a slinky dresses without bothering to look at price tags. But in constant, stressful overload she is, and for this reason she grabs our interest and manages to keep it -- though there are times the reader is likely to hold the book at arm's length. Take her self-pity at not being able to manage lunch with a friend, for example, or at not having time to get her hair highlighted. Author Alison Pearson does build suspense, however: How long will Kate be able to juggle it all? What will go wrong next? Will she risk her husband for a self-indulgent affair? (One obvious question not addressed: if she has too little time for her kids, husband and job, where will she get the time and emotional energy for an affair?) One more quibble is the \\"court of motherhood\\" passages; these sound forced and don't add anything we couldn't do without. But despite its faults, this is an enjoyable novel of modern angst and overall, very entertaining. On those nights when you fall into bed as tired as Kate, you could do a lot worse than this read.

B00005OC0G|3.0|I've been listening to guite a few versions of Beethoven Violin Concerto ever since I saw that collaboration of Miss Mutter and the late great Karajan on a television program.  That was quite some years ago, and Miss Mutter herself had said that she would have played it very differently now. <br />Personally, I prefer the earlier version.  Always elegant she has been, the earlier version has that youthful robustness which I reckon is more suitable for the piece, even with the slower tempo. <br />I agree with my fellow review that it was too little too late. It wasn't really warmed up until the last piece, Romance No.2, which was played to near perfection.  Often when I listen to that track I feel as if the violin was not played, but singing, all by itself. Can't praise more than that.<br />Overall, Miss Mutter was at her very best, and, shall we say, not her very best.
B000002UB6|5.0|shut up all of you who hate this album.  I dont care if it is a breaking up lp.  The point is that it is the best album of 1970 and one of the best Beatles albums and it is the best Beatles album song-for-song in my opinion.  So buy it and cry if you have to.  The beatles' best work is showcased here with Lennon's voice and Pauls melodies.  Peace
B00005JL78|5.0|With Spielberg and Cruise together, you can't go wrong. And they didn't. A very cool idea about crime fighting. It is the year 2054 and there is a new kind of law enforcement in D.C. called \\"Precrime\\" law enforcement. With the help of what they call \\"precogs\\", they can see a crime before it happens and stop it, and then they can arrest and put away the assailant. Tom Cruise is Captain John Arderton. Using the precrime system, \\"wooden\\" balls are formed with the victims name on it. Holding these balls in his hands using a virtual reality type system, he can see what the precogs see and determine the time, place, and who the killer is. During one of these runs, he see's himself comitting a murder. He starts running to keep out of prison and to find out who set him up, if he indeed was setup. Along the way, he finds out about something called the \\"Minority Report\\" which is a report that is filed when one of the three \\"precogs\\" has a different image of the crime than the other two. And the only way to get this report is to back to the police station and download it directly from the \\"precog\\" that had the other image. The problem is, all over the town and in almost every building, there are eye scanners that track everyone and can alert the authorities as to where any person is. The storyline was very imaginative and very well done. The special effects and action are awesome. This movie will take you on one hell of a ride and keep you on the edge of your seat as you can't wait to see what happens at the end.

0553381709|5.0|Book just don't come better than this.  A Storm of Swords is the best book in an absolutely amazing series of fantasy novels.  If you are the type that like those novels where the good guys always win and no one (except the bad guys, of course) dies, then it isn't for you.  This is written for people who like to read books that reflect how people really and truly would act.  It's refreshing to see that there is one author whp isn't blinded by perfect endings.  <br />This book is great because it features superb writing and an increible story than moves at a good pace.  The characters are the best part.  No character is one demensional.  The good guys aren't perfect and even the bad guys have their noble acts.  <br />Pick up this series.  You definitely won't be disappointed.  Don't think this is just a fascination with the deaths of characters.  It fits the stories rather well and doesn't do anything to detract from it.
B00002R0MC|5.0|As a fan of Bob Marly, I've been listening to his music eversince  I was born or about 5 years old. Reading his books just makes people want to cry because it's really sad how he died at the end of such illness, but really he made the world lived in peace by his music. It really influenced people to listen to it while they're in the mood or working on something hard and it just calms them down to get it done. I admire Bob's work because it was worth it, even though he died but he really accomplish what he wanted in life to happen.<br />One Love!
0618001905|5.0|King Leopold's Ghost illuminates a nearly forgotten tragedy in human history: the exploitation of the Congo on behalf of one man during the late 1800s and early 1900s.  King Leopold II of the Belgians enjoyed a reputation for humaneness due to his sponsorship of efforts to end the slave trade.  As Adam Hochschild makes clear, the King's efforts were calculated so as to obscure from the world what was really going on in the Congo.  Starting in 1885, Leopold's minions worked literally millions of people to death in the pursuit of profits in ivory and rubber. Brutality was commonplace and expected. There are horrific descriptions of attacks on villages, coldblooded mutilations, and other horrors.  Hochschild draws parallels between the Congo atrocities and the activities of concentration camp officials in World War II and in the Soviet Union.<br />This book is also an excellent reminder of what can be accomplished when decent people see injustice and vow to stop it. Starting with a few righteous souls outraged over what they saw happening, the movement to expose and end the Congo atrocities eventually spread to many countries and ultimately embarrassed the Belgian government into taking control over the colony away from the King.<br />The book is well written, and despite the horrors it details never descends into sensationalism. It deserves a place in the library of any one who wants to shine a spotlight on evil.
6305609705|4.0|This is not a war film, though often mistaken for one, leading to the false opinion of attempting and failing.  Rather this is an adaptation of Joseph Conrad's \\"Heart of Darkness\\" set in the convienent realm of Veitnam that is more accessible to the general public than some deep, dark, primal Africa.<br />In this effort the film succeeds remakably bringing to the fore all of the conflicts both of \\"Marlow\\" as he travels into the \\"heart of darkness\\" and struggles to resist the desires to be an effective God, or to follow his original intention, to kill Kurtz, and the depths to which Kurtz has lost himself to his dark desires.  \\"The horror.\\"

B000067J1Q|3.0|The Sound Of Music is both loved and reviled by critics and fans alike.  Those who hate it find the film cloying, overly sappy and contrived and those who love it find it a joyous celebration of love, triumph and wholesomeness.  I think that movie falls someone in between.  The film can be annoyingly sweet, but it is also that sweetness that gives the movie a naïve charm.  Julie Andrews is perfectly cast as Maria and Christopher Plummer is charming as the patriarch of the von Trapp family of whom Maria becomes the matron.  The film is a tad long, but the film is perfect for family entertainment where kids will enjoy and most parents will also like it as well.  The film has become something of an institution still earning screenings in the theater in most major cities.  The film was, of course, a bog office bonanza in it original release and it faired quite well at the 1965 Academy Awards winning five Oscars including Best Picture and a second Best Director award for Robert Wise.
B0000640VN|5.0|&quot;Kate and Leopold&quot; is a marvelous and whimsical romantic comedy blessed with an ensemble of gifted actors who demonstrate a great flair for sophisticated, light comedy.  The story concerns Leopold, Duke of Albany (winningly portrayed by Hugh Jackman) who is transported from the 19th century into the 21st century via a &quot;portal in time&quot; discovered by Kate's ex-boyfriend, Stuart (neatly played by Liev Schreiber).<br />Kate McKay (played by Meg Ryan) is a smart, industrious advertising analyst whose career is on the upswing while her love life takes a dive since breaking up with Stuart.  But her personal life gets a boost when Stuart introduces Leopold to Kate, although it is not love at first sight for Kate.  <br />Kate initially believes that Leopold is a nutcase since he insists that he really is a 19th century Duke.  But Leopold's gallantry and earnestness eventually soften the cynical Kate's heart.  Love and complications ensue.<br />Hugh Jackman is pitch perfect as the Duke.  Jackman wears nobility effortlessly.  And Meg Ryan is appealing and convincing as a career woman who discovers that there is more to life than work alone.<br />I must comment on some of the negative remarks made about Meg Ryan by some reviewers here.  While I respect those reviewers' opinions, I wholeheartedly disagree with their displeasure over Miss Ryan.  Meg Ryan is a gifted actress who makes comedy look easy (and it isn't). And she has a pretty face which sometimes produces a goofy, endearing smile.  <br />Meg Ryan cannot help the fact that she is cute, even adorable at times.  It is also not her fault that she has a girlishly youthful demeanor.  Because beneath her lightheartedness, Miss Ryan is able to convey through her expressive eyes a world-weariness and wisdom gained from life's sometimes harsh experiences.  To me, she is totally convincing as an intelligent, ambitious modern woman trying to balance a burgeoning career with a decent social life.<br />&quot;Kateand Leopold&quot; is worthwhile because its characters are so likeable and identifiable.  Their longing for love and acceptance is universal.  This movie is a witty and insightful homage to longings fulfilled.

B000002IM7|3.0|All of the essential elements of what make King's X the best hard rock band nobody's heard can be found on this nice debut: wall-to-wall guitar, provided by Ty Tabor; soulful lead vocals by bassist Doug Pinnick; and complex percussive passages, executed to near perfection by Jerry Gaskill. On top of that are the Beatle-esque harmonies that really set this band apart. <BR>The only setback is in the compositional skills of the band itself. While some tracks leap out of the speakers and grab you, like King, Shot Of Love, and Far Far Away, a lot of them are somewhat average and skippable. But for a first album, Out Of the Silent Planet stands tall against most other debuts. The sound is distinct, and this is a signal of better things to come.
B000002KHH|5.0|This is most definately the best album i have heard by Black Sabbath. Iron man, Paranoid, War Pigs, and electric funeral, four of the best Black sabbath Songs on one album!

0385508417|5.0|&quot;Skipping Christmas&quot; is, unlike many of Grisham's books, NOT about the law.  The story begins as Luther and Nora drop their daughter at the airport to pursue time with the Peace Corps.  Luther, an accountant, crunches the numbers indicating the small fortune that his family spent on the previous Christmas; since their daughter isn't in town, he suggests that he and Nora take half the money they spent and take a cruise.<br />We North Americans seem to spend a lot of the holiday season ... well, spending.  We seem to have lost the interfaith idea of togetherness, and many have found their only religion to be shopping and spending and competing, Oh My.<br />Grisham's characters' dynamics are so real that I forgot that I was reading a work of fiction.  Everything that irked me about these people was features in people I've known.  The difference between these characters and the characters of my own world is that, in &quot;Skipping Christmas,&quot; these characters surprised me in the end.<br />This is not typical Grisham.  It contains little detail, though what detail there is paints a clear picture.  It will not give the reader a good example of John Grisham's depth as a writer, but it will give the person new to Grisham an idea of the amount of skill he possesses.<br />The biggest problem with this book?  As with all books by John Grisham, I finished reading far too soon.<br />(Purchased for me via my wishlist )
B00005OAIE|5.0|I bought this CD after I heard the now famous \\"no such thing\\" on a public radio station in philly, WXPN (my favorite) in February 2002.  After listening to it non-stop, i had an infatuation with John Mayer's lyrics and musical talent.  His voice is captivating and sexy with his fun yet down to earth tunes.  The only thing that bothers me about John Mayer is the teeny-bopper following that has developped.  These kids don't appreciate his music for what it is, and that is what frusturates me -now that i can't get tickets to his sold out shows as well.  i recently bought his first album, Inside wants out, which has some songs that aren't on Room for Squares, but others are repeats.  I suggest this album strongly to those who appreciate good music- even if \\"everybody else\\" likes it.  Enjoy. (i'm open to suggestions from you! let me know what else i'd like!)
0060537639|4.0|The author makes an interesting case for his premise, and though the passage of time and the lack of written records has made his thesis lack the rigour and certainty we have come to expect from modern scholarship, he still constructs a compelling narrative.  The evidence of travel all over the seas by everyone from the Vikings to the Irish monks who set up monasteries thoughout Europe as far as Moscow and down through the Holy Land by the end of the 12th century is irrefutable. In one Irish bishop's grave in Norway  archaelogists have uncovered his crozier, and a jade Buddha.  We know for a fact that Viking Longships from the Shetlands and Orkneys sailed all the way down to Rome to visit with the Pope in the early 11th century, that settlements in Greenland existed in the 9th.  Therefore, the debate will rage on as to who ever 'discovered' America  for a long time to come.  This book is vastly entertaining, though, and provides much food for thought, and provides us with a wealth of fascinating information on a culture with which we should seek to be more familiar.

0446310786|5.0|To Kill a Mockingbird is a novel that deals with difficult circumstances around the 1930's. Atticus has two children that he must raise without his wife. Calpurnia, their Negro housekeeper, helps in raising Scout and Jem, Atticus's children. Scout is a tomboy who prefers the company of boys rather than girls; she also chooses to solve her problems with her fists. Jem always gives her a hard time and tells her to act more like a girl. Scout and Jem enjoy school, but they enjoy trying to get Boo Radley out of his house even more. Midway through the story the children come to learn that their father will be defending a black man named Tom Robinson, who has been accused of raping and beating a white woman. The two learn to be tolerate to all of the racial remarks said to them daily. In the end Tom Robinson is convicted guilty and ends up being killed in his attempt to escape. One night Scout and Jem are on their way home from Scout's play and are attacked by Bob Ewell, and Boo Radley saves them. In the end Jem has a broken arm and Scout and Boo walk together to Boo's house. When Scout returns Atticus reads to her until she falls asleep.      <br />      I was amazed on how exciting this book was. I couldn't put the book down. I just wanted to keep reading to find out what would happen next. It has been a while since I have read a book that I really enjoyed. The brother sister relationship of Jem and Scout reminded me about my brother and me. It is good to see that a white man was standing up for a black man in the 1930s. It is breathtaking to see that Scout and Jem learned to quickly deal with the pestering words of society, not very many kids are that strong. Racism is still around to this day and it is awesome to see that a white man was fighting so hard for a black man. We need more books that teach us what is morally right when it comes to racism. I would highly recommend this book to any person.
B00005JKCH|5.0|This is the movie I've been waiting for since I was 9 years old!  Director Sam Raimi and screenwriter David Koepp have gotten it just right.  The story of high school nerd Peter Parker's (Toby Maguire) transformation into the powerful, crime-fighting Spider-Man is light, humorous, and filled with action and thrills.  The major characters from the comic are brought to life by the fine cast.  I hope we get to see more of JK Simmons' J Jonah Jameson next time around.    Unlike many, I thought that the CGI effects worked well.  The one disappointment in this film--and it was a big one--was the design of the Green Goblin's costume.  Why did they put that blank Power Rangers-type helmet on him when they had such a fine actor playing the role?  The Goblin's mask should have been malleable, just as it is in the comics, so that we could have seen Willem Dafoe's acting.  As he demonstrated in the laboratory scene, he is capable of projecting frightening rage./

It's not only because of I love \\"rosanna\\", \\"make believe\\" and \\"africa\\".. but the SACD sound quality are really cool.. Never thought that you could enjoy the music so alive.. Thanks to SACD.. and Toto off course. But please.. more SACD titles from AMAZON.COM
0812550706|3.0|Before reading this book, a friend of mine had me under the impression that this book presented a cogent science fiction realm where intellect could thrive.  I, unfortunately, did not find quite what I was hoping for.  The literature itself was an annoying read for the writing style was lacking in clariy or simply bogged down with overly childish cant.  More importantly, however, I felt the book only lightly skimmed over the constituents of the philosophic implications of the technology or situations of the presented time, despite the fact that this, primarily, should be the essence of expression via science fiction.  From other praise, I see that many derive philosophic significance from some part of this book, but I am quite confused as to its source.  I felt there was quite a platform for the presentation of ideas of huge significance in both saving a world and living day-to-day life, but Card did not seem to actually probe these ideas to any extent.  Simply put: the ideas that could have been were not developed.<br />In the book's defense, I will say that a couple of entertaining twists were thrown and that, if one were to take some of the ideas that were almost planted herein and run with them through several conversations, something interesting might crop up on occasion that is, indeed, worthy of consideration.  Lastly, I am no major fan of contemporary science fiction; I read mostly non-fiction, so my opinion might be jaded by the thrills I find in our own non-fictional world.<br />Overall, the book was probably a waste of time.  I seek higher intellectual thrills than this book was able to give me.
B00005JKED|3.0|I'm still not clear on why Ethan Hawke was nominated for best supporting actor for this film, since he's the star, or co-star at the least.  And his performance was much more nuanced and convincing than Denzel sleep-walking through another tough-guy role.  Of course the twist on this one was that he's the bad guy.  But we've seen it all before, and better, in some of his other films (of course, The Bone Collector was a huge piece of garbage, too...).<br />So I give Ethan five stars and Denzel two.  And you gotta subtract some brownie points for the everybody-gets-what's-coming-to-them finale that is completely disjointed from the cynical tone the rest of the movie carries.  Hollywood is out of ideas.
6305013578|4.0|Despite what H.G. Wells, (a favorite author), writes about this film by Fritz Lang, (a favorite director), and understanding his disgruntled feelings, it is a masterwork. When one views Metropolis, one isn't looking at a sad-face clown portrait, but at a Renoir or Dali. This film is beautiful, with a poignant look at how society works. The robot Maria is indeed one of the most alluring robots ever to grace a film.<br />The story is well done, and the filming superb. The acting, as with most silent films, is very expressive. Keeping this in mind, the actors do an excellent job. In particular Joh Fredersen, the master of Metropolis is fantastic and plays his concern for his son against his despotic abuse of the workers. Thea Von Harbou, the author of the original book, unfortunately joined the Nazi party later on. In viewing Metropolis the film, it is obvious that Nazism was on the extreme opposite of its intention.<br />This DVD print is exceedingly disappointing, with many scenes washed out beyond recognition. Despite some fun extras and nice packaging, it just doesn't make up for the poor quality print. Fortunately, it has recently been restored and made available, which is a costlier version, but well worth the money.  If you'd prefer to not spend the money, this edition will serve you fine.  The film I give 5 stars, but this edition I give 1 star, which averages to a three overall, but I'll give the film another star, because it's great anyway, and that makes 4 stars.
B00005JKL8|2.0|I'm a big Owen Wilson fan, but he needs to stick to comedy.  And I love Gene Hackman, so I wanted, I really wanted to like this movie.  So I tried really hard to overlook the unlikely escapes, the bad lines, the ridiculous inability of the bad guys to hit Wilson with a hurricane of bullets.  In the end, though, this is just a bad movie.  I think the scene that sums it up is when Wilson is running through a minefield being chased by enemy soldiers.  He's able to outrun the explosions as he trips the mines which (of course) obliterate the pursuing henchmen.  Got that?  He outran explosions.  Save your IQ and do something else with your time.

B00004XQ83|5.0|.<BR>This is a terriffic CD loaded with real Americana that touches the soul.  I grew up with this kind of music in the 1930's.  <br />I gave this CD five stars because I couldn't rate it with four and a half. At the risk of sounding like a \\"dog in the manger\\" I was slightly disappointed that, great as it is, it is not quite up to the aesthetic quality of the film tract.  To me it seemed a bit too slick and \\"overproduced.\\" <br />Much of the problem probably occurred in the recording studio, where everyone wanted to improve on an already near perfect product. If it ain't broke, why try to fix it? In the CD the sirens were hauntingly seductive, but not quite as seductive as those in the movie. This lessening of sensuality was not due to the lack of accompanying video. I think the degradation is the result of inadequate aesthetic sensitivity in the mixing.  It's hard to describe so I'll just say the CD sounds too accoustically perfect and somewhat plastic, in the Garth Brooks mode.<br />The chain gang recording, though incredibly good, could have been even better if the sledge hammer blows could have been toned down a bit in volume so as not to overpower the emotion of the soulful chanting of the prisoners. <br />Previous viewers have voiced these same criticisms.  Other than for these minor impressions I found this CD to be among the all-time best of sound tracts.  Don't let my comments deter you from getting this CD. These songs just get better with each listening.  The words alone to IN THE JAILHOUSE NOW, BIG ROCK CANDY MOUNTAIN, YOU ARE MY SUNSHINE, and the other great songs make this sound tract worth having. The slightly off-key music sung by the little girls is an especially enjoyable experience. This is pure imagination and auditory candy.<br />Votes on the \\"helpfulness\\" of reviews seem to reflect the voter's agreement or disagreement with the reviewer's likes or dislikes of the CD rather than the objectivity of the reviewer's comments.  I therefore expect to get very few positive votes because just about everybody loves this CD. But rather than unreservedly joining the approving crowd, I want my review to be helpful in alerting a prospective buyer to what I see as its minor shortcomings so there won't be any surprises.<br />In summary, You absolutely CAN'T go wrong with this CD.  The entire family will enjoy it, especially the kids and older folks, and it will never get boring or out of date.<br />Al Thompson, Brady, Texas
0345340426|5.0|After 1000+ reviews, what more could I possibly say about \\"Lord of the Rings\\" that hasn't already been said? So, instead, I will try and direct my review to the skeptics out there that don't think fantasy books are worth their time of day. I was one of those people and I am eating my words. <br />I work in a bookstore and it seemed everyone had read LOTR but me. Finally, I gave in and read it, admittedly after seeing the first movie. I can say that I have never been more drawn in or got more enjoyment from anything I have ever read. Tolkien has created an entire world, complete with landscapes, maps, languages and races all from his imagination. But the morality and heart of this book is the true gift. The characters are so believable and trust me, you will find yourself cheering for the fellowship every step of the way. As far as the \\"bad guys\\" go, you will be afraid. <BR>   <BR>No matter what I say, I can never do this book justice. I will be reading it again and again. If you haven't read it yet, I envy you, because you are in for a treat. If you have, no point in saying more, because I am sure you know what I mean.
B00005V9IJ|2.0|Tom's acting in this movie left a lot to be desired. I don't believe he was convincing enough as the ship wrecked sole survivour. His performance was weak and uninspiring thru out the whole movie. I found that it would have been real easy to fall asleep through this movie even the first time I watched it. Robinson Caruso On Mars was a much stronger and inspiring, even though science fiction movie. Not worth the money, and I wouldn't add it to my 500 + DVD collection.
B00005LB9O|5.0|Radiohead?  Radiohead??  I can't really dream why these guys could be compared in any reasonable fashion to Radiohead.  <br />Now don't get me totally wrong - I think Radiohead are good in their own right, but Travis is to Radiohead as the Beatles are to the Rolling Stones...the only real thing in common between them is their country of origin.  (OK, please do NOT flame me here...this is just to make a point.)<br />Take a listen to Travis' Invisible Band album and I guarentee that you'll first go...\\"oh geez...this sounds way too boy band/sugar syrupy to me\\", then on the second listen you'll be singing all the lyrics to Flowers in the Window, Sing, Dear Diary, Caged...well the whole album.<br />Then on the third listen...when you think that you can't possible deal with the \\"up\\" feel of most of the songs on this album...you can counteract the whole business with the rather eerie lyrics and sounds that will lavish you in Last Train (my personal favorite just because it's the odd man out on this album).  <br />In actuality - this whole album is a great listen...and one which you'll be happily surprised over...because you'll never get tired of it.<br />Just trust me...and give it a go....you won't regret it.
0767805712|5.0|Wonderful sci-fi story that doesn't depend on special effects and gizmos to entertain.<br />The characters are fantastic, the story is fantastic, and it keeps you guessing all the way through.<br />Very enjoyable.  Story-telling at its best.
0679417222|4.0|The Moonstone is a slow-paced detective novel written in the 19th century in London, England. The Moonstone was first obtained by Colonel Herncastle who bequeaths it to his niece Miss Rachel on her sixteenth birthday. She is thrilled with her gift and sets the gem in her bedside table that night. When she awakens the next morning, the moonstone is nowhere to be found. The loss of the moonstone is told by Mr. Betteredge, a servant in Miss Rachel's house. Mr. Betteredge offers an outside opinion, as he is not directly involved in the mystery, but sees all that goes on.   The rest of the book is split up into different narratives from various characters of the book. Each character's narrative is able to give the reader more pieces to the puzzle. Wilkie Collins wrote this book so well that the characters stand on their own during their narratives. Their personalities surface and are not supported by one another. This was very helpful in keeping the characters straight due to the detail and character that Collins gave them. I really liked this part of the book because all the clues to the mystery weren't given to the reader on a silver platter. Every character in the book had a separate identity. They had more purpose than just happening to be involved in the mystery. <BR>The Moonstone is also unpredictable. Collins will lead the reader to believe and act on other facts before turning the evidence completely around and ending up with a conclusion that throws the reader for a loop. I appreciated this because it kept me reading. I found out who stole the moonstone along with the characters. It was refreshing not to know the answer and having to wait for the other characters to figure it out. I also found the little subplots that were created during the story. They showed the interactions of the characters and helped to explain the personalities of the characters even more. The only problem that I found with The Moonstone is that Collins has a lot of patience. He is contentto examine every detail before moving on with the next piece to the puzzle. He also encourages his characters to wait with the solving of the mystery. It is almost exasperating to be so close in solving the mystery that only one character must be interviewed. Almost always, the character will be indisposed or out-of-town. It was a little frustrating to have to wait for the characters to return and having to read about what they had for dinner in the meantime. On a positive note, reading The Moonstone was like watching a movie. However,  instead of watching the characters eat, the reader reads about it. This still only adds to the detail of the book and makes you appreciate Collins work on making sure that every element of the story is attended to. All in all, The Moonstone was a great novel, and I would recommend it to anyone who likes a good puzzle to solve.
0316666343|3.0|I found the book to be engaging.  The story was peculiar and innovative.  It had a disturbing plot but it was written in a way that it wasn't overly upsetting.  I read the book within 2 days it was one of those books you can't put down.
630512762X|5.0|First just ignore anyone who disses this movie, because they don't know the facts, end of story. The concept for this movie is pretty original I must say, and the actors do an extremely good job of executing that concept. I might also add that the gun fights in this movie are exceptional, true they are not as good as the ones in The Matrix, but then again what is? Buy this movie when you have the money to do so, or at least rent it. But whatever you do don't listen to any idiot that says this movie is lame.
B00005JLSC|5.0|The movie was captivating from the very start. The music, dancing and acting superb. Go see it.
0345340426|5.0|This guy is nearly as high on my respect list as Shakespeare!  That has got to be one of the hugest complements I have ever given!  Sure, the movie is good, but the books are a Masterpiece!  If you like action and adventure (and really, who doesn't) Then pick up one of these books, open the cover, and read.  I don't know anyone who has read these books and not liked them.  Some people find the first few chapters boring (like me!) but you just have to sit back and read it because you will not be sorry. <BR>WARNING! And do not skip any pages or you will become hopelessly and utterly confused!
B00007E8V4|5.0|When Los Angeles Nu-Metal quartet, System of a Down recorded Toxicity they recorded 33 tracks but chose 14 for the album. The remaining tracks, along with past pre-recorded work were left for a future that might not of been. But these tracks eventually leaked on to the internet and began circulating around the globe. In early 2002 when System of a Down heard about it, they were dissapointed that unfinished recordings were spreading like wildfire on the web. Eager to finish the tracks 100% The band got together and finished some Toxicity Outtakes and some tracks from as early as 1995 and put Steal This Album! together. The album consists of 16 tracks, from the quirky Chic 'N' Stu, (referring to advertisement and that it causes the need for the item), to acoustic Roulette,(Which Daron Malakian has been working on for 8 years). Daron Malakian admits that the album might not of seen the light of day if the tracks were'nt spread over the internet but stress in the future to wait until their tracks are officialy released as the unfinished versions isnt System's 100%<br />Serj Tankian stresses to fans that Steal This Album! is not to be taken as an outtakes or B-Side album, but an album in itself. \\"Steal This Album! was'nt released to buy time for our next studio album, it is a crucial link from Toxicity to our next album. It is an example of what we've done and what we are capable of doing.\\"<br />Steal This Album is a definate buy for fans and may need to be listened to a few times for first timers. If this is what System plan to put out for us, then their long awaited next album will be huge!
0375414053|4.0|I Don't Know How She Does It by Allison Pearson is a fictionalized peek into the world of a archtype heroine/super-mother named Kate Reddy.  Although Kate's struggles are often chaotic and tedious, behind her polished exterior is a tattered and tenacious mommy of 2 striving to achieve her profesional dreams while being catapolted into agonizingly impossible family chaos.  Before setting out to read this fascinating, albeit far-fetched, novel of working motherhood, I made sure to remind myself that it's only fiction and not to be internalized as a factual manual of \\"how to's\\" for mothers of today's working world.  With this in mind, I found Pearson's work enjoyable and fascinating as Kate Reddy plows through a loaded sexist work-environment, and puts up with a nanny who seems narcissitic and chappy.  If you're looking for a character to relate to as a working woman and mother, you might look somewhere else.  But if you're a fan of the eccentric and ready to take a ride into the world of \\"it could be worse,\\" then I recommend this book.  It's a delightful journey for those more grounded in mommy-hood and career than Kate Reddy.
B00006LLNU|3.0|after having the cd for 2 days, i m not sure whether i like it love it  dislike it or hate it.  it's very pleasant for the most part, i m not sure what other feelings it conjures. i feel very alone.
B00005JKZT|5.0|The director Peter Jackson shows his true genious throughout this movie. Although the movie doesn't follow the book as much as the first it is stil great entertainment and keeps the same Tolkein feel as the first movie did. Peter jackson has made this movie in a way were when you walk away from the theatre you thought the movie was pretty good, but the more you think, the better you realise the how good this movie is. Gollum's portrayal was superb. Exactly as in the book. Maybe even more amazing than in the book. The battle of helm's deep was exelent, and unlike most movies this movie actually looked like 300 men against 10,000. It actually even looked like more than 10,000 orcs. The ents weren't shown as much as in the book, yet the seige of isenguard was portrayed as in the book almost down to the last detail. Everything matched up together to make, The Two Towers.<BR>    Although, because much of what happened in the second book needs to happen in the third movie, the third movie may be too tightly squezed toghether and much may have to be left out in the third movie.Maybe even the storming of the black gates. But the small adventure after arriving back at the shire will most likely be left out. But I know for a fact that they still have the grey havens and the pass of the dead.
B00004RHZU|1.0|This was a terrible waste of money.  The only good songs to me are: Most Girls and You Make Me Sick.  The rest sound alike and are pure filler.  This was a terrible debut.  Don't waste your money on this one.  Wait for the greatest hits compilation whenever it hits the stores.
B00005JKZT|5.0|I loved this movie. It rocked. The actions scenes were terrific. Some people whine about how certain scenes were not int he book, or characters had problems. <BR>1. Faramir - in the movie, Faramir is depicted as capturing Frodo, considering taking the ring, and kinda being a bad guy at first. Soem people don't like this, but i do. It's just showing how Faramir goes through all the trials Boromir went through, and is establishing his character as strong when he overcomes it, unlike his brother. <br />2. Osgiliath - in the movie, Faramir takes Frodo and Samt o Osgiliath. True, this is not in the book, but you have to admit it added well to the movie, especially the Ringwraith at the end.<BR>3. The Warg Riders - the refugees of Edoras are attacked by Wargs on the way to Helm's Deep. This is not in the book, but it rocks anyway.<BR>A lot of things in the movie that were not in the book were added to make it even better.

0060537639|5.0|One of the problems I see in the attacks on Gavin Menzies work is that they are full of accusations and easy labels (e.g. &quot;pop history&quot;), without any refutation of the facts and reasoning made in the book. To the &quot;reader&quot; who wrote the first review: It's easy to level accusations at someone when you just don't like the way he turned long-held views upside down, but can you provide specific examples in any reasonable refutation? I can be a skeptic also, but the attacks that you have made seem shrill and cynical even to me. If you are going to criticize, at least read the book first! In your &quot;review&quot;, you wrote that the fleets were &quot;disassembled in 1421&quot;. What?!? If you had even read the excerpt or any other history book, you would not have made that mistake. So read the book with an open mind instead of focusing on that chip on your shoulder. Instead of calling the book &quot;pop history,&quot; there is plenty of evidence that such attacks and accusations are pop accusations.
B00005BJ2O|5.0|If you liked the movie, then this is definitely a CD you want to add to your collection. Each track will take you back into the movie and it's a great reliving experience of the wonderful and complex scenes of the movie. The sounds are upbeat and will make you feel good. Great CD. And if you have this one, you do not need to get Soundtrack 2 - too many repeats.
0743435753|4.0|The Graysonian politics and culture is the main draw of this book. Probably because I am getting very tired of space battles. On the other hand, the degree of melodrama, in some points, is truly frightening.
B000001FE0|5.0|When 1968 came to a close for The Bee Gees, they were becoming more confident as a group.  Especially with their performing and songwriting abilities, which had been improving greatly.  The Brothers Gibb were looking to conquer more ground in 1969 and they decided their next album would be their biggest yet.  A giant lushly produced concept album with orchestration and music of various styles.  It looked promising but sadly the production of this album was a major mistake in the Bee Gees career.  First of all lead guitarist Vince Melouney left the group in December of 1968, unhappy with the direction The Bee Gees were taking.  Though it was a friendly parting, things only went from bad to worse.  Robin and Barry were constantly fighting in the studio and when Robert Stigwood chose Barry's single (over Robin's) for release that's when Robin jumped ship as well.  The dwindling number of band members really effected the production of 'Odessa'.  It went from a group attempt at a very promising concept album to Barry, Maurice and drummer Colin Peterson (who left in June of 1969) just trying to finish something that was suitable for release.  It's amazing how well this album turned out after all the problems during production.  Odessa turned out completely different then it was intended.  As a concept album it's a misreable failure, but as a collection of great songs (each great on their own), Odessa is a great album.<br />The qualtiy of the music is what saved Odessa from completely bombing and today it is considered the best of their 60's albums.  Some wonderful music here.  It really showed the Bee Gees musical talents were maturing.  The hauntingly beautiful title track ODESSA (CITY ON THE BLACK SEA) opened the album with a tragic feel.  YOU'LL NEVER SEE MY FACE AGAIN was another lovely  ballad by Barry which fit well into the concept album form.  BLACK DIAMOND is one of Robin's finest vocal performances. I love his harmonies near the end of the song.  MARELY PURT DRIVE is one of my favourites.  The Bee Gees attempt at country rock and quite successful I might add.  This should have been a single.  It's obvious that EDISON was a concept album song but it's mysterious why the Gibbs recorded a song about the inventor.  Nonetheless Barry and Robin's vocals on this one are wonderful on this somewhat jazzy tune.  MELODY FAIR is another excellent song that should have been released as a single in America.  Maurice's SUDDENLY is a nice upbeat tune that really stands out on this somewhat dark album.  WHISPER WHISPER is nothing special until the drum break and bass speed up and by that time the song's almost over.  Two more favourites of mine, SOUND OF LOVE and I LAUGH IN YOUR FACE are some of the albums best and strongest songs.  Whereas GIVE YOUR BEST is a ridiculous country rck novelty tune that is quite flat.  NEVER SAY NEVER AGAIN is a powerful pop rock tune.  FIRST OF MAY and LAMPLIGHT were the contenders for that album's first and only single and the cause for Barry and Robin's fight.  Both songs are strong and wonderful but personally I think Barry's FIRST OF MAY is more appropriate for a single.  As for the three orchestra pieces SEVENS SEAS SYMPHONY, WITH ALL NATIONS (INTERNATIONAL ANTHEM) and THE BRITISH OPERA.  Well these are beautifully arranged pieces of music but would have fit better on an actual concept album rather than this collection of more or less singles.  Still these are worth a listen.<br />Overall Odessa is a wonderful album.  Personally I don't think it's their best album from the 60's (The Bee Gees 1st has that honour in my opinion).  However it still has some of the best music ever produced from that era of the Gibb's career.  It's truly a shame this album was never completed as the intended concept album yet we still have these songs which are wonderful on their own.  And afterall The Bee Gees were far from over.  This album was merely a learning experience for them.  They would reunite again and produce a handful of wonderful records in the years to come.  Highly recommended!
B00003CWTI|5.0|Don't be fooled by the flower-like name: this is not a weepy delicate movie. Nor is it an adrenaline-packed movie. It's more like a well orchestrated opera - or like a carefully crafted car: everything works so in sync that the final result is visually, mentally and spiritually enjoyable. The trick is to watch it with kid eyes: don't try to guess, watch CLOSELY - and allow yourself to be surprised. <br />Magnolia is a movie with amazing characters, a well crafted plot, dark-comedy moments, some surprising twists and a lot of provoking visual metaphors. No moral lessons here, just a fantastic portrait of our world on the stories of these persons and the (casual?) convergence of their obsessive quests- making them so similar in the end - all united under the fantastic music of Aimee Mann.<br />Three sequences for posterity: Tom Cruise teaching his magistral class on what is a man.. the Save Me sequence.. and the rain, the rain that pours..
014028009X|3.0|this book gave me a headache. The new charicters, the weird names, the whole word formation. But I guess that is normal for a book in diary form. It was funny, and made you feel for bridget. MUCH BETTER THEN THE MOVIE!
0312952813|4.0|I read this for summer holiday reading, having devoured The Black Echo a year or so ago. I found The Black Ice to be slightly more predictable than Black Echo, but nevertheless thoroughly enjoyed it.<br />I am not a huge fan of crime fiction, but I do love the Bosch novels. There is just something about the hard-bitten maverick cop scenario that appeals to me, as does the seedy portrayal of modern Los Angeles. <br />While not a classic, this is a great crime thriller that satisfies.
6304479689|1.0|Elvis achieves several classic performances in this video; highlights include &quot;An American Trilogy&quot; and &quot;Bridge over Troubled Water&quot; as well as informal gospel warmups and warmdowns such as &quot;I John&quot; and &quot;Lead Me, Guide Me.&quot; But this tape should not be available to the public in its present form.<br />In spite of Elvis's greatness, the film is horrifyingly bad. The camera work and editing are amateurish at best, with several outrageous mistakes--most notably Elvis playing his guitar left-handedly because of accidental image mirroring. The sound may be the worst of any concert video ever legally released, with the sound coming in and going out as though the tape had been left in the sun, the piano completely indiscernable throughout the entire concert, and several of the other instruments frequently likewise indiscernable because of the extreme tape hiss. Finally, any sense of coherent direction is nonextistent, with irrelevant pseudo-documentary moments interrupting Elvis's performances.<br />BMG has taken over Colonel Tom Parker's job of insulting both the art of Elvis and the sensibilities of Elvis's fans. And this video may be the biggest insult yet. This video needs the same treatment as &quot;That's the Way It Is&quot; received; until that treatment comes, I will refuse to watch this video.
B000001G16|5.0|I'm a teen, I like heavy and wild rock ... because most rock songs are wild and heavy ... but this is the first CD in Rock history that can be called beautiful. Yet (I don't know why?!)this album is so hirribly under-rated - meaning . . . well face it, YOU probably neber even heard of this album before, huh? Richie Sambora, the guitarist from Bon Jovi, released what is so different from his work with the band but is still such a beautiful piece of work. Beautiful because:<BR>1. I have never heard electic guitar sound so good! The melodies are complicated and unique but are so catchy and great!<br />2. Very Strong On The Lyrics. Richie is a genious in that field.<br />3. Gives a total new meaning to guitar solos. THE BEST SOUNding GUITAR SOLOs I (and many of my friends) have ever heard.<br />This is without a doubt the best sounding album I have heard! Still remains one of my favorites (Ya, Up there with Bon Jovi, Aerosmith and Billy Idol) <BR>Just give this one qa chance, you'll love it!
B00005JKZT|5.0|All I can say is, Jackson did a great job of adapting the book to a movie. I was totally overwhelmed when I saw it in the theaters just as I was when I saw Fellowship last year. The beginning was sweet just like the first. I like this one just a tad bit more than the first. The fighting scenes in this one were much better than the fights in Fellowship by far. Helms Deep rocked! As did the Gandalf and Balrog scenes, the Warg battle, and the Ents destroying spree. After the first time I saw it, I was amazed, but my overall opinion had yet to come. I mean, there were many things they changed on what happened in the book. But a few days later, I read the reasons for the changes and grew an even greater appreciation for this film. I did decide I liked this one a tad bit more than Fellowship. I mean, afterall there were also many changes in the first one as well. Some people complain on how this movie is not exactly like the book. \\"OH MAN! I CAN'T BELIEVE IT! IN THE BOOK, THEY PULLED BACK ONLY ONCE AT HELMS DEEP! I DON'T LIKE THIS MOVIE NOW!\\" They also complain about other small things such as the outcome of the Ent Moot. Hey it eventually came to the Ents in battle and that is all that matters. Well it doesn't seem clear to them that MOVIES ARE DIFFERENT FROM THE BOOKS. And if the movie is too much like the book, people are going to complain on how boring it is (not that the book is boring, but movies entertain people in a different way). But then there are the bigger changes such as the Warg Battle, Elves at Lothlorien, Faramir, and Osgiliath. I don't at the least bit disagree with these changes. I think they're just fine. Jackson didn't make those changes to ruin the story. I thought the Warg Battle fit into the movie well. I mean, I guess those people would rather see this on the people's way to Helms Deep walking..walking..walking...walking.. And as for the Elves at Helms Deep, we get more action and hey! Elves are cool! And it also makes it more convincing that sucha smaller army could have held out against ten thousand for a night. The changes with Faramir show that all men are corruptable. And Osgiliath was pretty cool too getting to have a preview of Gondor. Gollum was amazing! And his humor was an unexpected welcome. I love the conflict between Smeagol and Gollum. Its both humorous and makes you feel sorry for him. Gimli was great for comic relief. I mean some people act as if hes turned into freaking Jar Jar or something... This was a great movie and wasn't disapointed in the least. The extended edition will make the movie even more better and less fast. I can't wait to see Return of the King..BLAST! Another torturous wait...
B00005JKZT|5.0|I loved the the Fellowship and this movie was a spectaculair sequal.  I really didn't think they could make Legolas or Aragorn or anyone else any better, but they did!  I've seen it three times and plan to see it again and again!  And \\"Smeegle\\" (my apologies to those who know how to spell it) was so cute!  I loved him!  Sure, he was evil at times, but really, he was a charming creature.  I have never read the books, so I'm don't care if they changed anything.  As someone who saw just the movies, this was the best movie ever!  I'm not saying it's better but it's just as good as the first one and we all know how great that was.  I mean, who didn't cheer when the elves marched to help Theoden?  (And yes, I do know that didn't happen in the book)  Please!  Go!  If you adored the first movie, you will love this one as well!

0316666343|4.0|Actually, I give The Lovely Bones 3 3/4 stars. For me it's better than 3, and almost a 4, but just a hair short.<br />Granted the goings-on in society today, this tale of a missing, murdered girl is a very relevant one. It can help us explore the possibilities behind such events, seeing the situation from several angles, including what goes on in the killer's world, and how friends and family cope behind closed doors.<br />I found it quite a nice concept to write the story this way. It is not in any way a whodunit, and even has a spiritual, New Age-ish feel. I just don't know why I had certain expectations of the novel that led me to give it less than 5 stars. It's really a rather interesting book, but maybe because I knew it involved crime, I thought it was going to be a very &quot;grounded&quot; read. Sure, Susie's already in heaven when the story begins, and that alone is a very ethereal thing for those of us still on Earth, but I really continued to think that that would be the only distinctly spiritual thing about it. But then, the novel reaches its climax and that's where it turns New Age-ish, like I descibed earlier.<br />Being into psychic and metaphysical matters myself, I love stories with such themes. But in this case, just because Susie's in heaven yet manages to tell us her story doesn't mean I was prepared for the very surreal ending of this book! It was fun to read, but I'll admit... I was thrown a little off track by what happens in the end, like the story was heading in a certain direction, but then we find ourselves somewhere else entirely. Read it to see for yourself.<br />Entertaining and eye-opening.
0679720200|5.0|regarding the book:  my rating of five stars is self-explanatory, and no further review is needed.<br />this \\"review\\" was actually prompted by some of the pseudo-intellectual garbage being tossed out in other reviews here.  i'm simultaneously annoyed and saddened when folks attempt to disguise their own ignorance with name-dropping, or mispelled vocabulary that could have easily been gleaned from the pages of the \\"Obscure Word of the Day\\" calendar...>i appreciate a bad review - when it's well done.  everyone has a right to his/her opinion after all.  But . . .<br />Points:<BR>(1)this book is a translation.  if you think it reads a little rough, keep in mind that it was written in french.<BR>(2)the author uses very dry, simple prose.  hemingway also used dry, simple prose.  hemingway did not write this book.  if you want to review hemingway, do so -  but wouldn't you be more comfortable doing it in the Hemingway section?<br />(3)who expects poetry or lyricism in an existentialist novel about a frenchman with no conscience?  i would be horrified and offended if this book were made beautiful.  beautiful is for \\"paradise lost\\" and God.  Meursault doesn't believe in God.<br />i believe that anyone would be perfectly justified in hating this book.  it could honestly be called \\"depressing\\" or \\"utterly pointless\\", and it is, i assure you, completely bereft of any emotion higher than hunger or sexual attraction.  Many of us would say, \\"That's the point.  It's existentialism.\\"  If existentialism isn't your cup of tea, you will hate this book, and you will be right for hating it.  <br />HOWEVER<br />i am loathe to see a good book trashed by someone too simple to understand it.  my plea is this:  please don't destroy what you don't comprehend.  If you must write a bad review, do it with style; make us all feel your pain.  Give us details, evidence, and facts so that we can learn to hate with a vigor to rival your own!  That way, we know that you truly read and understood the book . . . and thought it totally sucked eggs.<br />agh, enough ranting -<br />\\"The Stranger\\" is, in my opinion, one of the greatest books ever written, but that's just my opinion.  Either you get it, or you don't.
B000002GAF|5.0|Although most people love and cherish Gino's biggest hits - i.e. \\"I Just Wanna Stop\\" and \\"Wheels of Life\\"- which this release certainly offers, when you listen to the album in its entirety, you will understand why this is a truly great work. Heart-felt lyrics (always a staple of Vannelli's music !),funky synthesized beats (thank you Joe!) and ambitious entries like the title song make the whole a major delight. One of my personal, all-time favorite Gino songs is on this LP, too - \\"The River Must Flow.\\" Check it out !
0792837614|4.0|I do have to say that I love this movie for the most part. I always find myself getting incredibly attached to Riff (Russ Tamblyn) and despising Tony(Richard Beymer) based on their fantastic/horrid acting and singing. Tamblyn put forth a wonderful performance as the leader of the Jets and led fabulous songs such as &quot;Officer Krupkie&quot;, &quot;America&quot; and &quot;When You're a Jet&quot;. Meanwhile, Beymer displayed his lack of ability by making Tony appear as just a crazy boy, not a crazy boy in love. Natalie Wood (Maria) did an excellent job and at times made up for what her co-star was seriously lacking. However the woman who dubbed Wood's voice was not my favorite and I found myself unable to listen to some of the songs by fast-forwarding through &quot;Somewhere&quot;. I was only able to sit through &quot;I Feel Pretty&quot; and &quot;Tonight&quot; because they had other cast members in them and are just great songs. The medley of &quot;Tonight&quot; continues to astound me and gives me goosebumps whenever it hits my ears. Other actors who did a great job were Rita Moreno and George Chakiris, Who played Anita and Bernardo. Despite some of the bad acting, it is an overall great movie with great dancing and good music. It's no &quot;Into the Woods&quot; (my favorite) but it's still good
B00005YW4H|5.0|When I first purchased this CD I only listened to \\"Don't Know Why\\" and \\"Come Away With Me.\\" I didn't bother listening to the other songs for a while. A few weeks later I decided to give the rest of the CD a try, not really expecting to care for any of the other songs. Once I started to **really** listen to the CD I couldn't stop. It creates a very calm, relaxing mood without being insipid. There was not a single song that I didn't like. In fact, there wasn't a single song that I didn't LOVE. Some are better than others of course, but they are all wonderful. I think this is a CD that everyone should listen to at least once. Sure you may not like it, but it's a CD that I highly recommend. It is certainly worth of five stars and if I would give it an even higher rating if I could.
0385508417|1.0|Save your money!  This book was so boring and predictable, I wish I had saved my cash!  There's a reason this book only has so many pages.
B000005JA8|1.0|Considering how much it costs to get an album nowadays, you can't really justify throwing something away.  Then again, you can't really justify listening to this album twice.  Here's a tip: if your friends tell you that this is the best music ever made, borrow their copy first.  If, after that, you decide you can't live without it, then buy it - but make sure that you don't buy this solely on the strength of someone else's recommendation, or you may make a tragic mistake.  The more you know.
B00005JLSC|5.0|There is very little to prepare the end of the year movie-goer for the sheer glory of this VERY cinematic transformation of CHICAGO.  From the very first flicker on the screen (which sets a mood as successfully as the equally excellent CABARET, another gem by the same writing and choreographing team) the audience is consumed by the story, the music, the fine, fine quality of every aspect of this film.  The intersplicing of real life story with a staged musical version, creating a blur between fantasy and reality is just terrific.  The cast is splendid:  Richard Gere, Catherine Zeta-Jones, Renee Zellweger, Queen Latifah, John C. Reilly, Taye Diggs all own their parts and give more than convincing triumphs in the singing and dancing roles.  The direction is tight, every scene well paced, and the camera work is some of the best of the year.  This movie is an utter joy, and the proof is watching the audience applaud at the end, then  sing, whistle, and dance as they exit the theater.  Treat yourself!
B00005QG9J|5.0|...And also one of my favorite cd's I own. This album doesn't sound much like their old albums at all; it's actually more heavy, just in a different way, however, there are more soft songs on this cd then hard, and they are all brilliant to say the least. If you want something similiar to S.C.I.E.N.C.E, you won't find it here, but you might as well give it a chance or you will miss out on an icredible album. The only thing I don't like about the album is the slighty muddy protection.
0393312836|5.0|This book makes you think about life, and it shows you the silver lining in the clouds. Such as our wonderful US goverment. I know were better off than most countries, but its still corrupted. it tells about how a boy named Alex is driven to kill himself because of what the goverment does to him. the goverment controlled his mind and drove him insane, which happens everyday. the goverment hides these things from us, thats why i love this book so much. plus its just plain strange, which i like.<br />its hard to understand at some points but you gotta love it.
B00006BTCA|3.0|The music is a  rip off of the Psychadelic Furs and attempts to add in trippy Cure'ish background noise. I like the music, but the lyrics are shallow and sophmoric. A nice attempt from the designer drug generation. The album leaves me hollow and unfulfilled like the plastic recycled world in which we live. <br />For those that compare this album to U2's Boy album I have to laugh (deep from the diaphram). Those who grew up on U2 understand what the lyrics of U2 meant and the cause and grief that U2 was addressing during that period in time. Those that did not grow up on U2 read a bit of history on Ireland before listining to the first 4 U2 albums.<br />Maybe when Interpol finds a cause to grip onto we can place them in the ranks of U2, but for now the baby is still teething and wiping the slobber off its chin. I do think when the baby matures this band will make its mark and start to form cognitive writing skills. <br />Even though I give a bittersweet review, I am glad to see this flavor of music creeping back into the mainstream. I am so tired of the watered down nirvana/rap/hip-hop/madonnafied/Liberace laced sound that has saturated the  mainstream. <br />I will have to admit that Interpol has brought me out of my musical dungeon that I've locked myself in for the past twenty years. It is good to see someone actually picking up a guitar and making music come from it that caresses my alpha waves  instead of the three fingered power cord sound with wrist slitting lyrics that brings a droning thud to my ears.<br />I believe that the music industry is missing the boat by not pushing this band and others like them. The industry complains that they are losing money because of piracy. I have to say .... They are losing money because they are marketing bad programmed music to teenagers. What teenager wants to waste their valuable money on an album which has one listenable song out of 10. <BR> <BR>I have not bought and album in 10 years and Interpol broke this cycle for me. I bought it. So wake up record industry and start signing and promoting new bands again that know how to at least play their instruments and are not afraid to expirement.

B00006LIRI|5.0|I thought that the \\"Best of 1980-1990\\" collection musically, was awesome with alot of their strongest songs from their 80s heyday. However, I thought that compilation was forced with only one new song \\"Sweetest Thing\\" being a re-recording of a previous B-Side and with the hit songs having large parts cut out especially \\"New Years Day\\" & \\"Where The Streets Have No Name\\" and it dragged down the collection as a whole. However that was made up for with a 2-CD edition that made it a worthy addition to my CD collection and the same holds true with it's successor \\"The Best of 1990-2000. <br />U2 did not have as many major hits during the 1990s like they did during the 1980s and they were going further & further into experimenting with techno sounds which started with their 1991 masterpiece \\"Achtung Baby\\", went even further into techno with the craziness of \\"Zooropa\\" and eventually imploded with their vastly underrated opus \\"Pop\\", the latter of which the songs lifted off if were re-recorded. After that, they returned to their 'pre-techno' days with their critically acclaimed \\"All That You Can't Leave Behind\\" which is yet another great album from U2. <br />This second hits collection is a playing tape of U2's 90s experimental material and it<BR>S a great retrospective of their music from this decade although it has minor flaws just like every 'hits' CD does. I mean, there isn't such a thing as a 'perfect' \\"Greatest Hits\\" CD, even from my perspective but \\"Best of 1990-2000\\" nonetheless is a marvelous 72 minute CD of 16 tracks of amazing U2 music. There are 6 new tracks, four of which are re-recordings of older songs. There are also three songs that are lifted from soundtracks such as the haunting \\"The Hands That Built America\\" from \\"Gangs Of New York\\", and the bizarre \\"Hold Me, Thrill Me, Kiss Me, Kill Me\\" from Batman Forever. <br />Ok, the flaws begin with \\"Electrical Storm\\". There are two version, one original, and one William Orbit Mix. From my perspective, this is one ofU2's best songs in many years with elements of Orbit's haunting production and the song is one of the strongest cuts on the CD. However, I'm not sure if they messed up in placing Orbt's Mix on the regular 1-CD version of this collection instead of the regular version which is one the 2nd dico of the deluxe 2-CD edition as it should've been reversed with the original on the 'hits' CD and the Orbit Remix on CD2 of the 2-CD edition. Brushing aside the clumsy choice of the songs positions, both version are great but I love the Orbit Remix more. <br />The second flaw begins with some of the re-recordings of some older songs. While I have nothing against this, I feel that in the case of \\"Gone\\", & especially \\"Discotheque\\", the stripping away of the techno sounds reduces the pleasure ability of the songs that were present on the parent album version from the \\"Pop\\" album. \\"Discotheque\\" especially suffers from this. While the \\"New Mix\\" version is good, the original version on \\"Pop\\" with it's techno-pop charisma, has a very explosive, loud, & colorful feel to it where as the stripping away of it's techno feel, it robs the song of much of it's colorful sound. Overall, though, the song remains a classic nonetheless even in it's newer reincarnation. All is forgiven. \\"Staring At The Sun\\" and \\"Gone\\" on the other hand don't suffer as badly as the previous two tracks I mentioned even though I enjoy the originals more. <br />Third, of course is the exclusion of strong songs like \\"Who's Gonna Ride Your Wild Horses?\\", \\"Trying to Throw Your Arms around the World\\", and \\"Lemon\\" and \\"Elevation\\". Then again there was so much strong music that U2 did that there isn't enough room to fit them all on just one disc and making it a double album of just hits would probably kill the sales of the parent albums so I'm cool about all that. <br />It's still a smart decision to include \\"One\\" and \\"Mysterious Ways\\" on here as these two songs are as strong as anything that U2 did during the 80s if not better. \\"One\\" is a bittersweet ballad with a sense of bitterness, sadness, yet happiness, and warmth melted in with the sad & bitter feel to it. \\"Mysterious Ways\\" is one that's hard to explain but most of us have already heard it so there's little need to but what I can say is is that this and \\"One\\" are among U2's best songs they ever made. I personally think that U2's 90s works are as strong as their 80s works. <br />Apart from all of that, I think that this CD is a marvelous successor to the 1980-1990 collection. In fact, I think that 1990-2000 was much better assembled than the previous hits CD was as where that one offered little new, the 1990-2000 set offers plenty of new or non-album(not B-Sides) tracks that are worthy of having on here.<br />If you find this which isn't hard to do, I suggest getting the Deluxe Edition of this collection as the second disc contains some B-Sides and some awesome remixes that are truly haunting, fun, & amazing. By just getting the regular version of \\"Best of 1990-2000\\" you'll be missing out on some incredible yet obscure music that U2 made that I think is even stronger than what made it one the \\"Hits\\" CD. Even if you decide to just get the 1-CD version, this collection offers a lot more new material than what the 1980-1990 collection does in terms of 1-CD editions. This collection was worth the wait. If you can afford it, get the deluxe edition because disc two is worth the money. If not, then the regular version of this collection will do well too. Buy it! :-) :D
0385508417|5.0|Wow...never in my wildest imagination did I think I would like this book as much as I did.  It's campy and cute, the most darling Christmas book I've ever read.  And it's quick, too.  I read the whole thing while my husband drove us to my parents' house for Christmas.<br />For anyone who's ever been brave enough to tally up the cost of Christmas, it's amazing how a little ham or turkey, tinsel, wrapping paper and stocking stuffers can quickly put us into a very un-merry mood.  When Luther's daughter Blair decides to head to the jungles of Peru to join the Peace Corps, it seems that Christmas for him and his wife just won't be the same.  So they decide to do away with the whole idea and simply skip it this year.  Afterall, they'll be saving a bundle....enough to skip away to the Caribbean islands to sip margaritas and eat until they pop.  So they truly give it up...no charities, no gifts, no cards, no tree, no lights, no carols - NOTHING.  Sounds simple enough...  Cliche for me to say this, but easier said than done!<br />What I loved most about the book was that Mr. Grisham writes in such a way that you feel you are there.  His adaptation of the typical American Christmas will probably mirror your own family's.  For anyone who's ever precariously dangled off the top step of a ladder for the sake of meticulously stringing lights and perching a star upon the top branch of a tree, they could easily relate.  Sure, the spirit of Christmas is beautiful.  And the gifts (both giving and receiving) are truly special.  And the magic of the season is unsurpassed by any other holiday....but is it worth all the hassle??  You'll be agreeing and disagreeing with the philosophy of the family in this book as they tell their story.  No doubt you'll be laughing.  This book is too doggone cute for words.  It's certainly not worthy of a Pulitzer, of course, but it's surely worth a read.  It's made it's way into my collection permanently.<br />Oh, and I agree with the reviewer who said this should be made into a movie....however, I would pick someone much more serious than Steve Martin.  I'm thinking Dustin Hoffman....he's versatile enough to be grinchy, stoic and funny in the same role.id this should be made into a movie....however, I would pick someone much more serious than Steve Martin.  I'm thinking Dustin Hoffman....he's versatile enough to be grinchy, stoic and funny in the same role.
B00006LJ72|4.0|The music in this collection can be compared to many other kinds of music. I'll start at the bottom of the musical-merit totem pole.<br />In comparison to the countless, mindless, swear-laden, barely literate, and excessively dissolute songs from our ephemeral run-of-the-mill radio pop-star icons, this collection of music is vastly superior. Songs about abusing substances, women, weapons, etc., do not even hold a candle to the contemplative words and divine sounds of Enya.<br />Now, at the top of the musical totem pole, you have some of Enya's previous releases, among a few other elite musical works and collections. When \\"Only Time - The Collection\\" is compared to these, this reviewer's opinion is altered accordingly: There's nothing truly new here. Although there are some B-sides (tracks that are only available on singles and not on albums), there are some left out. All the other tracks are featured on her albums, with which most of her fans are totally familiar. Lastly, I can't access the video and other computer features on the 4th CD, but that may be just my computer.<br />On the plus side, the booklet inside the collection makes for a good read (albeit quick), and the box itself is beautiful... to say nothing of the fact that the track organization is commendable.<br />Should an Enya lover buy this? Well, if your financial situation is a bit tight, skip it. But if that's not an issue (or you just want to splurge) then this collection is worth your money.<br />If another collection of Enya music is released and it is simply more of her album tracks mixed in with a handful of b-sides, I will not buy it. But since I do not have her previous collection, I plunked down the cash for this one. The only Enya I can afford to buy after this is all-new stuff or a hypothetical disc of rare b-sides and relative-unfindables [viz. \\"An Ghaoth Ón Ghrian\\" or \\"The Solar Wind\\", the MP3 of which I have is a bit gritty and distorted in places].
0064430227|5.0|kids, schmids--i see this as a story that can encourage ADULTS: take a page out of harold's book and create your own happy reality! no need to stagnate in a job, friendship, marriage or town that doesn't fulfill you: just step out on faith and \\"draw\\" what you need. <br />i've done that very thing all my life... so i am honored that this book was written in 1955, my birth year!<br />(you GO, harold!)
6305499365|5.0|This is a surprisingly pleasing movie, whether you work or are too young to get a job. The film makes fun of work, all sorts. From Cubicles, to peppy waiters, to the wonderful &quot;ehs&quot; of construction workers.<br />Ron Livingston plays a man who is tired of his job. After getting hypnotized, he quits caring about his job, and gets his friends to go in on a scheme with him to get rich by stealing bit by bit from the company. But, when one of his accomplices screws up and too much money is taken out, they have to worry about what they'll do to cover up to keep from getting put into a federal prison.<br />The only problem I have with this movie is that its content got a little too needlessly mature for me. This film could have been just as good without all the cussing. But that's just one problem with an otherwise REALLY funny film.
B00005JKED|3.0|I have been a huge Denzel Washington fan for a long, long time.  His nearly flawless portrayals always hit the mark, and this is no exception.  If you're looking for gritty, down and dirty urban cliches this is your film, but it left me wanting.  Maybe I wanted to see some kind of redemption, some bit of humanist in Washington's character.  There is none -- but of course that's the point.  I supposed the problem boils down to this:  Denzel is too good in his portrayal of a corrupt, cynical, and debased police officer.  It was a disturbing bit of \\"realism\\" and it took a while to get it out of my head.  Denzel's portrayl, so against type for him, is impeccable, but it is just too disturbing to provide any real form of \\"entertainment.\\"
B00003CY6M|4.0|My husband and I saw this movie on cable and I loved it so much he gave it to me for our anniversary. It is a story about two people that come together in a chance meeting and can not get the other out of their mind. It is about fate and love and where one should be and with whom.
B00005IBGQ|1.0|This joker has the adasity to bad mouth the Backstreet Boys as a 5-headed monster.  He also refered to them and other young pop bands as \\"little boys\\" bands.<br /><br />After listening to this sorry artist's work I have concluded that just because Backstreet Boys have not written most of their songs and just because they are young - or at least younger than Wainwright, does not mean they can't sound good.  Wainwright's vocals sound AWFUL and does his silly yoddoling.  So what if he write his own stuff.  Backstreet Boys could sing it better.  So what if he has been around longer, young artists have been around longer, ie Jackson 5, Partridge Family, Hollies, Association.<br /><br />I would rather listen to the Backstreet Boys and even Green Day over this sorry old artist.<br /><br />OK so 90 people did not find this review helpful.  Well it figures.  However I did not post this w/o having any knowledge of what this artist sounds like and I said I think he sounds awful.  I did not say he has no talent or has no right to make music.  His implication was exactly that concerning the Backstreet Boys and I think he was out of line.  His music and BSB are two different genres entirily and therefore there is nothing to compare.  Fans of this music may not like BSB but that does not mean they have no right to put out music too.  I do not think RW's music is any good regardless if he wrote and played it.
B0000797IO|1.0|I realize it is harsh to give this movie only 1 star, considering I love Jennifer Aniston in Friends, but one of the only redeeming qualities about this movie is that it is only one and a half hours long. Although the acting in the movie was good, the plot goes no where.  Not to mention I had to look down at my watch several times to see if time was standing still.  What was said in the movie could have easily been done in 40 mins instead of one and a half hours.I don't understand what people like about this movie; I can't exactly say everything I disliked about the movie without giving away the ending, but in all the positive reviews no one really says what it is they like about it.  It certainly cannot be the ending to the movie, because every time I think about it I don't know if I should laugh or cry for Jennifer's character.
B00005JKZT|5.0|The Two Towers is the kind of film that makes you want to stand and applaud in the theater.  And it is appropriate for what is happening in the world today.  When Sam explains why he and Frodo must fight on it is as though he is speaking directly to the movie audience as if the character himself knows we are eagerly listening in.  Don't miss this flick -- it leaves you hungry for the 3rd installment of the series.  It is terrific and the cinematography, acting -- all aspects of the film -- are the best epic I've seen in years and years.  GO SEE IT and then GO BUY IT as soon as you can.
0316926345|3.0|The first two thirds of this novel are almost unmatched in Post-War British Literature: witty, insightful, acidly satirical, and, in their own way, powerful.  The sense of character and place is especially vivid, and personal and social tensions are brilliantly entwined.<br /><br />The last third is marred by a love interest that is anemic and thoroughly unconvincing.  Here the characters and imagery lapse into caricature.  Julia's climactic sacrifice is ludicrous, as is a long (and infamous) stream of purple prose.<br /><br />Waugh sought to dramatize the tension between the Sacred and the Profane.  But if the Sacred is upheld by a trinity of nostalgia, sentimentality, and reflexive Catholic guilt, lord help us all.  Ryder's \\"epiphany\\" is as much a shallow pantomime as his faux-naturalist paintings.<br /><br />The scene in which the \\"hero\\" and his aristocratic friends brutalize striking workers for a lark, is one of the most repulsive in all literature.
B00005QDW1|2.0|All I have to say to those who like this.  Quit bellyaching about Britney Spears.  Ok so maybe No Doubt write their own songs but would you complain less about Britney if she did.  I think not.<br /><br />No Doubt have reduced themselves to young pop artists status here.<br /><br />Now all is not lost here, I like some of the songs like Keep On Dancing.  Let's get a remix going.  Hey Baby is catchy but it is more silly than any Britney song.  Stefani's vocals are not really any better thatn Mrs. Spears either.<br /><br />This is a fun cd.  Hit me baby one more time!
B00005QZ7U|5.0|This movie is a must-buy.  Baz Luhrman strikes again, and this time his vision is nothing less than superb.  Nicole Kidman and Ewan McGregor, as well as the rest of the outstanding supporting cast, radiate in their performances.  The mind it took to create this is special.  Don't panic in the first 5 minutes when it begins and vivid images pop out at you from every angle -- almost an overload of imagery.  Hold on because it will settle in to one of the most heartfelt, unique and moving stories ever seen on screen. I've watched it 10 times at least, and every single time I watch it I notice something else.  It is a film experience like no other! MAKE THIS A PART OF YOUR FILM LIBRARY!
B00002Z88D|5.0|At first I was to say the least sceptical of Metallica collaborating with an orcheastra but when I heard this I was just blown away!!!... The whole sound of the show to put it plainly as I can [rocked]!!! I own almost 100 live CDs and bootlegs but nothing even comes close to the awesome superhuman mammoth power of this show. The intro-instumental 'Call of ktulu' is just amazing and spinetingling and deservedly won a grammy for best instrumental performance. It runs straight into 'master of puppets' and when it's opening chords are hit you can actually hear the hysterical roar of the audience ABOVE the sound of over 100 instruments- not least Newsted's super duper heavy basslines!!I could go on for ever but to put the rest of this review short 'For whom the bell tolls' will put tremors on your stereo and is performed with brilliant passion again raising the roof. The symphony does the intro to 'Battery' and combines classical music and metal in way which one could never think possible. There are a few new tracks in this show too the best of which is 'human'. You must hear it- it's an awesome song similiar a little to 'one'. Just BUY this CD it's incredible and it's a landmark CD(forget Deep Purple 1970 it's nothing compared to this). I would go so far as to recommend it over any Metallica original CD(by the way but 'Master of puppets ' as well) which is a huge recommendation.
B00000JGHM|5.0|I could go on &amp; on but i will spare you.Put simply this movie is the greatest,if you love a tense action thriller with dialogue as exciting as the action itself then this is the film for you.<br />I live in hope that one day Warner will re-issue this DVD as a special edition.
B000002BBY|5.0|In 1994, Oasis took the nation by storm, with their awesome debut album &quot;Definitely Maybe&quot; and many thought they could go down two roads with their next album. They could:<br />-Fail to impress with the second album, much like their Mancunian predeccors, The Stone Roses.<br />-Make a steady natural progression with their new material.<br />Neither of these things happened, because this is much more than a natural progression. This is a huge sprint forward. The production work on this album is much better, and Alan White makes a huge difference to the quality of the songs. Bu also, the music is better. From &quot;Up In The Sky&quot; to &quot;She's Electric&quot; in less than a year! Everyone knows the classics, &quot;Wonderwall&quot; and &quot;Don't Look Back In Anger&quot;, arguably two of the greatest ever singles to be released. These are awesome.<BR> But, it's not about the singles. There isn't a bad song on this album. The worst song here is probably &quot;Roll With It&quot;, a much loved 'Quo Style&quot; rock song, and no less than no.2 in the UK charts! The best song is debatable. Whether, it's &quot;Champagne Supernova&quot;, the light entertaining, &quot;She's Electric&quot; or the huge rocking &quot;Morning Glory&quot; or &quot;Hey Now!&quot;, they are all wonderful songs. The Gary Glitter excerpt, &quot;Hello&quot; is a real good rocker, and &quot;Cast No Shadow&quot; is beatuiful. <BR> I would reccomend this to everybody! Not just Oasis fans, or not just even rock fans! EVERYBODY!
B000001FS3|5.0|a must have...they sure don't make them like that any more
B000062YAZ|5.0|WOW,all i can say is WOW!!,what a killer cd here,from that opening riff to Angel of Death,to the closing riff to Raining Blood,it never lets up,if your in the mood for the thrashiest metal ever,BUY THIS!!,Also check out Sepultura - Beneath The Remains,Great cd there.
B00005RYP7|2.0|This film had an interesting premise.  The cast was promising.  The Glass House seemed like a fairly interesting little film.<br />It was interesting in a disappointing sort of way.  While the DVD quality was good, the actual quality of the story leaves much to be desired.  The performances are OK, but the story waivers and is inconsistent, and doesn't adequately set you up for a lot of the plot points.  In terms of a thriller, there are definitely WAY better choices out there.  And a lot of questions aren't really answered effectively, so the plot can't chug along in the manner intended.  That being said...you see the outcome a MILE away.  But The Glass House just doesn't delivery in terms of a strong, well-constructed story that hums along and packs a punch in the thrills department.<br />Really...watch this if you are forced to only.  It's just a waste of time otherwise.
B00000K19E|5.0|Needless to say, I loved this movie and was thrilled to get the widescreen edition on DVD.  I give it 5 stars for THE MATRIX itself and 5 stars for the bonus features.  If you're not into production notes or &quot;Easter eggs,&quot; then buy THE MATRIX strictly for the movie, but the additional features are rather nice, including a short HBO documentary, commentary by Carrie-Anne Moss (Trinity) as well as editor Zach Staenberg and visual effects supervisor John Gaeta, and a music-only track.  Explore a little further, and you'll stumble upon a demonstration of Gaeta's &quot;Bullet Time&quot; effect from conception to final realization, not to mention a few other video goodies.<br />As an aside, if you don't have home theater speakers for your DVD yet, THE MATRIX should give you an excuse to buy some.  Or at least buy a subwoofer.  Enjoy!
B00005YUPO|2.0|As a fine arts teacher for middle and upper schoolers, I was very excited to see what all the hype was about.  The combination of music with visual art is a natural way to involve multiple senses for all ages and create that \\"teachable moment\\" in a fun and exhilerating way.<br />Granted, the music is great -- how could it not be?  But to pair such masterpieces with commercial toys in a very clumsy and amateurish video production and call this educational is an abomination!  Really, the only purpose that I see to this pairing is pure and simple -- money.  They want you to buy all the toys.  And after watching this over and over, your kids will beg you to go out and buy them!  Now are the toys really that bad?  Probably not, but for a production that prides itself solely on its educational value, then why are we all subjected to one big commercial for all of these products?  (I find it very interesting that at the end of the video, the narrator/creator tells us exactly where we can buy all of the toys -- hmmm, what is she getting in return for this \\"free\\" advertising?)<br />This series had great potential, and does expose kids to classical music(thus the 2 stars).  My two nieces (8 months and 3 years) are mesmerized when they watch it. Entertaining?  Perhaps. But is it educational?  Not in my book. Just think what it would have been like if the creator had paired the music with swirling abstract colors, shapes, and lines, like Disney's \\"Fantasia\\" where characters morph into abstractions to emulate and support the idea that music is an abstract form of communication.  Or even if they showed people actually playing instruments to make the connection between what is heard and how the music is produced.  Too bad this series wasn't created by real educators.
B00003CXI1|1.0|Everybody loves special effects in the movies, but these Harry Potter films have one special effect parents are missing.  When the movie is over the seeds of witchcraft are planted into the mind of their child and a wicked life will result.  What evil goes in, will come out.  Repackaged witchcraft for children, that's all it is.  For example; many convicts in prison practice witchcraft with many wizard tatoos and demonic symbols.  There is no such thing as good witchcraft as this movie tries to portray.  The special effect is yet to be an unpleasant surprise upon the next generation having grown up with witchcraft firmly implanted and recognized as harmless fun.  The crime level is going to rise.  Just look at the evil spells the Harry Potter movie uses to propel the plot; drinking blood and other witchcraft evils.  Hardly innocent and harmless!  Is this what you want your children to watch?  Woe to those who call evil good and good evil.
1573228737|5.0|When I first started reading, I wasn't sure how I would enjoy it.  The progression was a little slow at first; but the by the middle, I was completely captivated in Waters' world.  The foreshadowing is placed so excellently, and the characters so real, as to make the book quite wonderful.  The ending actually made me cry; which I never do.  I still don't know whether I want to scream at it or just cry more.
0688152023|5.0|Peter Martins has worked a small miracle with this comprehensively wonderful anthem to the human body. Most of us seeking an exercize program begin our regamins with good intentions but, I would think, grudgingly. Study the faces of people jogging on the street, &quot;powerwalking&quot;, or laboring in gyms, and despite protestations of &quot;runners' highs or endorphin &quot;cascades&quot; to the contrary, most of these people look simply miserable. Perhaps that is so because they are missing the point: exercize can be a gift to oneself; it needn't be a demand we make of ourselves or a whip we hold over our heads for the purpose of shedding pounds or lowering cholesterol. Exercize can be--as Mr. Martins seems to tacitly imply--an almost sacred experience insofar as it can enable us to move closer to the ideals of physique and wellness that we all hope to obtain.<br />I have noticed that several reviewers have criticized the first part of this book because it is an apparent departure from the task at hand: to tutor the reader in an exercize program ostensibly used by dancers of the New York City Ballet. This, in my opinion, is hollow criticism. Peter Martins is clearly setting the table for what is to come. He is very gently leading the reader to accept the possibility of an idea that he has found to be true in his own life: exercizes used by professional dancers can be learned and practiced by everyone to tremendous advantage for more robust health, enhanced gracefulness, and to develope a physique that will make us feel more at home in our bodies. To those ends, Mr. Martins has been uncommonly successful. His passion for his art and his belief in the potential of his readers fairly spills from the pages of this book and we begin to believe that yes, we, too, possess a marvelous God-given instrument that we can mould into something more wonderful and beautiful than we might imagine.
B00006RU5B|4.0|This long-mooted and much-delayed collaboration is a supergroup in the true meaning of the word. When Soundgarden's Chris Cornell comes together with the powerhouse behind Rage Against The Machine - Tim Commerford (bass), Brad Wilk (drums), and Tom Morello (guitars) - you know you're not in for a peaceful hour. Even minus the political clout and personality of Zack de la Rocha, this is rock on an epic Led Zeppelin scale. In other words, how it's meant to be.<br />Fears that this would be an ego-fuelled jaunt for spent forces are thankfully unfounded. CVs as accomplished as these four would be hard to find if you trawled the rock archive looking for suitable applicants. The unrivalled voice of the grunge generation and a band that dealt in pure rage long before Fred Durst decided to break stuff sounds mouth-watering on paper. In reality (and on record) it doesn't disappoint. <br />There's pretty much everything you would hope for from Cornell in terms of lyrics - metaphors for religious grandeur, an obsession with the power of the elements, finding yourself rock bottom - and his voice still shudders with unsurpassable soul and depth. Morello's obviously been dying to treat us to his latest nimble fretwork and duly obliges with a real axe masterclass, while Commerford and Wilk construct a rumbling tsunami track after track.<br />As a whole, 'Audioslave' is the type of album that prowls menacingly and requires maximum volume at all times. Opener 'Cochise' sets the tone immediately with some almighty riffs and Cornell gives his vocal chords a long-overdue workout. 'Show Me How To Live' and 'Gasoline' are trademark Rage Against Machine, while 'What You Are' has a brooding force and 'Set If Off' is a primeval beast.<br />If Zep were a Rolls Royce then Audioslave are a top of the range gleaming Mercedes Benz with producer Rick Rubin as the chauffeur. These are men with a passion for perfection, making this record tighter than Robert Plant's leathers. It's sheer velocity bucks current trends of lo-fi production, meaning it'll be construed as unfashionable but at the same time those who've been crying out for such an polished rock album will be overjoyed.<br />Whether this is a one-off or the start of a beautiful relationship, Audioslave have dwarfed any rock uprising of the past few years to become the first truly great rock band of the 21st century.
0316666343|3.0|My 12-year-old son requested this book as a present after having it recommended to him.  Reading on-line reviews, the book looked fine, and I bought it (teenage girls said how much they liked it).  The jacket descriptions looked fine, and I gave it to my son without reading it myself.  I have candidly discussed sex, violence and rape with him (and I knew that this was a part of the book), but I do not take him to R movies.  However, when he read me the first chapter, I was appalled at the graphic details of the rape (page 14):  \\"'Big white panties,' he said.  I felt huge and bloated.  I felt like a sea in which he stood and pissed and shat. ... He started working himself over me. ... He was inside me.  He was grunting.\\"  Certainly the child abductions and molestations of last summer have made all pre-teens as well as teens aware of rape.  However, I found this description to be too vivid and inappropriate for pre-teens.  I now wish books would have a rating system so that parents would know what to expect.  I would have really appreciated a warning to read pages 13-15 of this book prior to letting my son read it.  I would have liked my son's first explicit description of the sexual intercourse and how it felt to have been of pleasure instead of pain and violence.  Perhaps I am too overprotective?  Or perhaps we are rushing our children to grow up and grapple with issues before they are emotionally ready?  I am certainly not saying that the rape is presented in anything but a very negative light;  I just question the appropriateness of this book to pre-teens due to its graphic description.
B00005RFAI|2.0|Released on Mon 28 Jan 2002<BR>Label : LaFace/Arista<BR>Pink artist area<br />Did you hear recently Pink proclaiming to be more talented than Madonna? Quite a claim for someone on their second album. Especially when that second album, is, frankly, not very good. Apparently a return to Pink's &quot;skater roots&quot;, 'Missundaztood' ends up more Alanis Morrisette.<br />Anyone looking for some spicy R'n'B to follow up Pink's fantastic breakthrough hit, 'Most Girls', will be sorely disappointed.<br />Opener, and title track no less, is weak, which is not a good sign. It's the sound of Pink playing in front of her mirror with a hairbrush, complete with awkward grunts and embarrassed giggles.<br />Elsewhere on the album, Pink asserts &quot;I'm a hazard to myself&quot; over possibly the worst track Dallas Austin has ever produced ('Don't Let Me Get Me'). Recent single, 'Get The Party Started', is a respite from the dirge, but only if you've consumed sixteen pints of alcohol and/ or are under sixteen years of age.<br />The most affecting moment on this album is the heartfelt 'Family Portrait', which hints at deeper workings in Pink's mind. It's also provides a welcome refuge from the rock-lite production which dogs the majority of this album. 'Missundaztood' ends on 'My Vietnam', a tasteless title if ever there's been one. It features such wonderful lyrical insights as &quot;life keeps dropping bombs and I keep the score&quot;. The song fades out as the American national anthem plays in the background.<br />I kid you not. More talented than Madonna? We'll see 15 years down the line. 'Missundaztood'? Maybe, but on this evidence, it's nobodies fault but her own.
0316666343|5.0|this was a beautiful book. susie is a well-written character. i loved alice sebold's description of how she lives vicariously through her sister and is still the young girl she was when she died. the characters ruth and ray both developed artfully and realisticly. this is a wonderful story about the afterlife.
B0000024K1|5.0|It Takes A Nation of Millions To Hold Us Back is the second of three albums released by Public Enemy. Although some might argue about whether this one is better than either Yo! Bum Rush The Show or Fear of a Black Planet, it is probably fair to say that this is the album that best defines their style (or at least their percieved style). <br />At the time of ...Nations..., Public Enemy was Chuck D., Flavor Flav, Terminator X, Professor Griff and the S1W's, and (in some sense) the Bomb Squad. Chuck D is the lead rapper with Flav providing a sorta ad-lib background. Terminator X speaks with his hands only, and the S1W's are a pseudo-military thing in lieu of dancers. Among the Real Rap(tm), PE is probably the most well-known, respected, and popular group (ie Vanilla Wafer and MC Mallet aren't real--sorry). In a way very similar to Run-DMC in 1983, Public Enemy in 1988 changed the tone of rap.
B00005OAIE|5.0|Rather than compare John Mayer to Dave Matthews a more accurate comparison might be to Michael Franks.<BR>Mayer has the same light jazzy-ness of Franks, track 6 in particular. The lyrics are eqully light and mushy.<br />I think the reviewers slagging this album are WAY off. Yes, it might be bubblegum guitar pop, but it is very well executed indeed. <BR>Don't miss out on the chance that this album may grab you and take you on a wonderful, sleepy, melancholy ride.
B0000024IE|5.0|Since the time of ...Nations..., Public Enemy has lost Professor Griff... sorta. But they still have Chuck D, Blackman and Lyrical Terrorist; Flavor Flav, The Joker; Terminator X, The Assault Technician; as well as the S1W's (Brother James I, Agent Attitude, James Bomb, and Brother Mike). Professor Griff is listed in the cover, but I'm not sure how he contributes to PE anymore. All I know is that he is banned from public interviews as a spokeman for the group. <br />Whatever. <br />We begin our tour of the Black Planet with a glance at the front cover. What a dope poster that would make. If you could judge a CD by it's cover, I could stop here. <br />In short, whether this is better or worse than Nation, it is a fine example of dopitivity in action. Buy it now. <br />Oh, before I go, let me mention that there's a brief two or three second conversation ending the last track that returns us to the beginning of the album: <br />                  \\"'Talk to me about the future of Public Enemy'<br />                   'The future of Public Enemy gotta....'\\"<br />On that note, I shall end my review.
6304493681|5.0|This movie is one of the most stunning anime movies I have seen. Think of &quot;The Matrix&quot; and &quot;The Terminator&quot; and you got &quot;Ghost in the Shell&quot;. Not only is &quot;Ghost in the Shell&quot; intelligently intriguing, there is amazing action (car chases, gun wars, explosions, etc.), a great story, and good characters. Coming with that, of course, is the typical Japanese anime nudity. This is probably one of my favorite anime movies of all time but what would have made it better if they made it longer and progressed with the Major's adventures. But besides that MINOR flaw, I thought this movie was excellent.
B00006LSM3|5.0|Not a day goes by that I do not listen to this album.  Don't think I will ever tire of this music.  It is uplifting, moving, witty & wry.  If some of this music does not move you, then no music ever will.
B00005NGAK|5.0|On July 25, 1998, in Hyde Park, history was made.  Performing on the largest stage ever built, Michael Flatley with over 100 dancers performed Feet of Flames in front of an audience of 50,000 people.<br />With the plan of it being his last performance, Michael Flatley decided to do one last, huge, triumphant and expanded version of Lord of the Dance.  He called it after his solo: Feet of Flames.  The entire show is Michael performing at his best.  Compared with the original Lord of the Dance, Michael and all the dancers have become much more free, and they relate to the audience at an incredible level.  With all new costumes, added dances and songs, Feet of Flames is truly a masterpiece.<br />Michael's flute solo Whispering Wind, is a touching traditional air.  He is a world champion flautist and his playing is beautiful.  Celtic Fire (a new number with the band) showcases the often neglected talents of the musicians.  It is traditional Irish music played in very untraditional way, and it is absolutely fantastic.  The new Siamasa number is simply a joy to watch.  The dancers look happy, and are so energetic one just wants to get up and dance with them.  But the most incredible part of the entire show is Michael's new solo.  With no music and no other dancers, it shows just what he does.  From slower, variated rhythm patterns, to blazingly fast footwork, and everything in between, this is Michael Flatley's masterpiece.<br />I have watched Feet of Flames 30+ times since I got it this past October, and I absolutely love it.  The 'Making of FOF: Into the Fire' is almost a full length film in and of itself, and gives a fantastic day by day report of the two weeks leading up to the show.  Feet of Flames is Michael Flatley at his best.

B00005LIN0|2.0|While the singing is lovely and the music, in general, is well performed -- the dramatic content of this production is severely lacking.  I've never seen such a low-key bunch of mourners in my life!  The ensemble looks embarrassed to be singing.  In fact, everyone in this production seems to be trying to avoid the obvious -- IT'S AN OPERA!   They all look like they are trying to pretend that they are speaking rather than singing.  The emotions are small and this production falls far short of the mark.  Gershwin's musical and emotional masterpiece presented musically, but without emotion.  Sad.
B00004XQ83|5.0|This sound track is the best to hit the market in a long time!  Your feet will be moving and you will be singing along.  Great songs!
B00003CXRM|4.0|After hearing about the positive praise of this movie from a diverse crowd and wondering why the soundtrack was in the charts for quite a while, I finally got the opportunity to see this movie. &quot;O Brother, Where Art Thou?&quot; is the second Coen brothers film I've seen since &quot;The Big Lebowski&quot;. The adaption of Homer's Odyssey was really creative of the Coen brothers since the movie bears some allusion but don't use this movie as a substitute for the real poetic epic because it does not tie into the real story. George Clooney, John Turturro and Tim Blake Nelson make a decent trio as three ex-convicts who are running from the law. They have some strange encounters, a blind prophet who is travelling in a hand operated rail car, three sirens who are washing clothes by the river, and a gigantic bible salesman/KKK member who has only one eye. Those encounters are just some of the allusions to The Odyssey. The trio also take an &quot;alias&quot; to get the public's attention as the Soggy Bottom Boys with their skills in folk singing as Ulysses Everett McGill (Clooney) tries to come home to his wife and kids.<br />This movie was kind of funny thanks to Tim Blake Nelson's funny southern accent and how the story went. John Turturro had done a decent job as the tough guy of the trio. The thing I liked most about the movie was of course, the music. I'm not a big fan of country, bluegrass or folk but the tunes were catchy, particularly the scene where Clooney, Turturro, and Blake Nelson sing &quot;I am a Man of Constant Sorrow&quot; even though Clooney did not actually sing and just lip-synched. The &quot;Down Into the River to Pray&quot; song was my second favorite because it had some inspiration into it. I liked the scenery of the South even though it had sort of the orange yellow tone color that existed most of the film. The style and creativity is what I liked best about the movie because the Coen brothers had written a good story that is funny and enjoyable.I am going to get the soundtrack and listen to this decent southern music.

0393317552|1.0|This book is basically politics masquerading as science. Hence it's appeal to left-wing campuses and all the hoopla that goes with such success. If true then affirmative action can be considered likely to succeed, but if it is based on exraordinary  assumptions then failure is to be expected. These assumptions are that man arriving in the various continents had no impact on the survival or extinction of the various edible and otherwise useful plants and animals to be found in his area. Man, in each case, Diamond assumes worked optimally with what was there. Since in Australia for example there are very few indigenous edible plants today, the macadamia nut, he simply assumes despite  the paleobiological evidence that this has always been the case, that men simply  didn't send some useful species into extinction in some places and not in others as he overused that commodity, whereas elsewhere as in Eurasia and MesoAmerica, it was deemed useful to save some to regenerate more later. Perhaps Neolothic Eurasians reacting to IceAge conditions, evolved- see Meme Machine,   Blackmore - the ability to plan ahead, noticing the connection between seed and future food. Australians by contrast- see Descent of Man,  Darwin - burnt the green forests for the short term gain of catching edible   kangaroos escaping, so changeing  the forest to desert or to fire tolerant eucalpytus. Who knows what possible edible plants, or animals with beast of burden potential, went extinct in the process. Diamond blithely assumes that none of this should be considered as he develops his political ideology.

0679721037|4.0|On August 6, 1945 a noiseless flash spread out across the early morning sky of Hiroshima.  One of the greatest diasters of World War II had just occurred.  This is the story of six people of all different social classes surviving the atomic bombing of Hiroshima.  With an explosive force of 12,500 tons of dynamite it completely annihilated the city of Hiroshima.  This book is the stories of six survivors excatcly as they remember it with no detail left out.  Although they endured the same horror they all have very different points of view about what happened on that fateful day.  This book tells the stories of Miss Toshinki Sasaki, Dr. Masakzu Fujii, Mrs. Hatsuyo Nakamura, Father Wilhelm Kleinsorge, Dr. Terufumi Sasaki, and The Reverend Mr. Kiyoshi Tanimoto.  It conveys the message, that through the horrors of war, some good can come out of it.  For instance, people joining together to help others in a time of need or distress.  A book that has the ability shed light on the horrors the Japanese people faced is truly a work of art.  John Hersey has written a masterpiece of literature that should and MUST be read by everyone.

B000083C49|3.0|Although I enjoy the culture-shock humor in this film, I think its reputation as the \\"best\\" of the original-cast movies is undeserved.<br />The whole plot set-up is one huge contrivance, a deus ex machina to get Kirk and crew out of the hot water they got themselves into in the third movie. The alien probe exists solely as a plot device, with no sensible motive and no explanation ever offered. The time-travel solution is a cheat -- if they can do it then, why not do it every time there is a serious threat? Spock could have taken the Enterprise around the nearest star in \\"Undiscovered Country\\" and prevented Kirk and McCoy's framing on assassination charges.<br />I will probably buy, or at least rent, the DVD because I do like the movie despite my criticisms, and I have found the extra features on the first three deluxe editions to be worth the time. But it's not the best Trek.
0783239955|5.0|I truly enjoyed this movie, and can watch it over and over again.  If you liked &quot;The Closet&quot; try this one and vice versa

B0000009TJ|4.0|This album is called the Best Band You Never Heard In Your Life.  That is an appropriate title for this album, because on it, you never really get to hear the band.  This album is fun, but it is mostly joking around and the band never really breaks out.  Each disc is about 65 minutes long and the sound quality is excellent.<br />In 1988, Zappa toured for 4 months with a big band, featuring Ike Willis, the Fowler brothers and many others.  He has released 3 albums from that tour, Broadway The Hard Way (a single CD consisting of mostly new songs that hadn't been recorded before),  Make A Jazz Noise Here (a 2 CD set, consisting most of instrumentals), and this one.<br />This album is mostly novelty songs.  He does some interesting covers of classic songs like Purple Haze and Sunshine of Your Love.  Some of them are just goofy, but the version of Stairway to Heaven is great.  He spends a lot time talking about Jimmy Swaggart, and actually rewords a number of songs in his &quot;honor&quot;.  <br />For most of the album, the band is in the background, mostly playing rythym.  The only gets to shine on a couple of tracks, like Bolero (from Ravel) and Inca Roads.  There are three good guitar solos from Zappa, especially the 10 minute solo during part 2 of the Toture Never Stops.<br />This album is fun, but there are only a few tracks that you would want to hear more than two or three times.  If you like the humor part of Zappa's concerts, where he talks to the audience, this is a good album to get.  If you prefer to hear the music, get Make A Jazz Noise Here, instead.
B00005YW4H|5.0|My daughters' boyfriend gave her a copy of this cd. I heard the music coming from her room and I asked her who the artist was.I think Norah Jones has a wonderful sound and I have added this cd to my own collection.
B000000JO3|5.0|Even some 20 years later, I still remember how awestruck I was while seeing/hearing Minor Threat for the first time. It was at  The University of Maryland's student union during the dark Reagan years and I was just dumbfounded by their speed, passion and intensity. The power and ferociousness of the music remains unmatched( The Bad Brains came close). This album/cd is a chance to hear the passionate and desperate sound of the only band that mattered since the Clash. No one since has even come close. I think Fugazi (with Ian McKaye) (and everything Henry Rollins has done), is great, but nothing compares with what is captured here from Minor Threat.
B00005JL78|2.0|I am a huge Speilberg fan, and i was very disappointed at this flick, i found my-self struggling to stay interested, the bottom line? It was to long, to long for its own good, i am glad i did not go see this in the movies, cause i would have for sure dozed off. The dvd set has great features on it, i guess if your a fan of Tom, you should get it, but i would recommend renting it first, then see if you want to buy it, cause it's defitnitley not a film you'll watch over and over again.IMO
006092988X|5.0|This is one of my favorite books of all time! Although it seems a challenge to read since it has 500 pages, there wasn't a single page where I was bored. Betty Smith focuses on Francie's struggles and thoughts about life, her family, and the world surrounding her. Tragedy and tough choices plauge Francie all throughout the course of the story. Her lovable but unreliable father, loving, realistic mother, and favored, companionable brother add conversation and relationship to the book. This book is a moving tale of one little girl who tries to understand the world around her and teaches the reader about love, sacrifice, and hope in the process.
0316666343|4.0|Michiko Kakutani nailed this book in her review in the New York Times, which I read after reading this book.  (nytimes.com > books > bestsellers)<br />I didn't think I would like Bones much because stories about 14-year-old girls put me to sleep, and heaven excites me as much as angels, unicorns, and i's dotted with hearts.  But Sebold pulled me in with a good story about how a death affects the lives of those around her, at times touching, funny, exciting, and sad.<br />Written plainly, as if told by an intelligent teenager, the story falls down only once.  (I actually slapped my forehead and groaned.) But she pulled it out of that tailspin, ending satisfactorily.<br />A good yarn.  I smell movie.

B00003CXDZ|1.0|I have read the glowing terms that other reviewers have used to describe this film, and I am amazed.  I don't care how \\"groundbreaking\\" the attempt was, the resulting film was so disjointed and boring that it was only the second film in my life that I could not sit through.  After a half hour of it, I had to turn it off.  This was the first DVD I tried to watch on my new player, and it was so bad that I had to go and rent another one just to take the bad taste out of my mouth.
B000002AGE|5.0|Probably the most known album from the Jazz-rock band 'Weather report'. Just listen to the track 'Teen town' to discover what great bass-guitar playing is all about and why Jaco Pastorius was said to be one the greatest of the bass players. 'Rumba Mama', a drum solo, has african influence. 'BirdLand' and 'Remark you made' are also very good. It has nice jams and pacy music. I am not a great listener of jazz music, still I can enjoy this recording. I guess that says a lot.
B00006CXXU|5.0|I was a fan of Christina the minute I heard her sing Genie in a Bottle. Although she was constantly being compared to other pop stars, I knew that her voice was much stronger. I anticipated this album's release until I read all of these horrible reviews. I started wondering if i should buy it at all. I am so glad that I did because I disagree with all the negative comments. <BR>First of all, I have to wonder if they even listened to the album, or just the song \\"Dirrty\\". Although the lyrics to this song have a sexual connotation, it is misrepresenting the rest of the album. This album is inspirational and encouraging. Christina's voice really shines on the tracks \\"Walk Away\\", \\"Beautiful\\", \\"and \\"Loving Me 4 Me\\". All of these songs are about having respect for and loving yourself. \\"Cruz\\", \\"Soar\\", and \\"The Voice Within\\" are about change and growth. The only other song on the album that is sexual in nature is \\"Get Mine, Get Yours\\". It is a great song to dance to. I don't see what everyone's problem is with the lyrics to this song. Yeah it's about commitment free sex. Just because it's a taboo subject doesn't mean that it doesn't exist. Everyone does it and doesn't talk about it. At least Christina gets it out in the open. Don't hate her for it.<BR>If you are looking for an album with a great variety of pop, RnB, Rock, Latin, and even some psychodelic punk (\\"Make Over\\"), you will like this album as much as i do. I have to wonder...if \\"Dirrty\\" hadn't been the first single, and instead it was \\"Beautiful\\", would there be all this fuss?<BR>Christina may dress provacatively but there are many women entertainers who do the same. As far as her lyrics are concerned, she is a 22 year old woman, not a teenager. She shouldn't be forced to stick with the same teenage audience she had years ago. She's way past the mickey mouse club! (If you are expecting the old Christina, then you are going to be in for it.) She writes about angst because that is something we can all relate to at this age. Christina really surprised me for the better and I hope that if you are considering buying this cd, you will look past the way she dresses, and truly listen to the songs on the album. Christina's talent speaks for itself.
B000002ADT|5.0|I will not name this or declare this the greatest jazz album ever, because quite frankly, I haven't listened to all that's out there, and it would be unfair to label this album as such.  However, after being introduced to this album by a close friend, I can honestly say that it has changed my outlook on music forever.  You simply couldn't ask for a better lineup of performers on this record, with Coltrane, Evans, Adderley, Kelly, Chambers, Cobb, and of course Davis all playing like there's no tomorrow.  Every song on this album catches you from the moment it begins and expands itself more and more with each listen.  It's a very free album, with modal jazz tunes unrestricted by chord changes and strict writing arrangements.  It's as if the band got together in the studio, said &quot;light swing in the key of B major&quot; and just took it from there.  Although Coltrane's tone leaves a little to be desired (Getz and Parker had much better tones, in my opinion), his playing is fantastic, and rivals that of his masterpiece, &quot;Giant Steps&quot;.  Adderley really shines on this record because his bright, resonant tone contrasts with that of Coltrane, offering different flavors to each song.  Kelly and Evans both tear it apart on the piano (duh, we're talking about two of the most influential jazz pianists of all time), as do Paul Chambers and Billy Cobb on the drums.  This album proves that it's not what a rhythm section plays, but HOW they play it.  Cobb takes relatively simple drum patterns and makes beautiful music with them, ala Elvin Jones and Max Roach, unlike the amazing yet abrasive, often distasteful stylings of virtuoso Buddy Rich.  But of course, the ultimate reason this album has received the acclaim that it has is the unmistakable lyrical tone of Miles.  No other person has ever captured moods and feelings like him on the trumpet.  The notes bleed off the record from the incredible amount of emotion in his playing.  He captures the playful (So What, Freddie Freeloader) melancholy (Blue in Green) and the romantic (Flamenco Sketches) moods with the greatest of ease, and it seems as if you ARE Miles Davis while listening to the album.  Every song here is perfect.  Most of the songs have a light, relaxed swing feel to them, but they never tire, and the album uncovers more and more joyful secrets to the listener with repeated listenings.  This version is great, including in it the alternate take of Flamenco Sketches, which is probably my favorite song on the record.  The alternate is a much more emotionally concise version, putting the still amazing final take to shame.  Adderley's soloing on this tune is especially fine.  Simply put, because I'm running out of time here, this album will change your perspective on jazz and music in general.  It works on so many levels, and can be listened to while doing practically anything.  I can both mow the yard and sleep to this album.  It never gets old; in fact, I find that with each sitting, I have enjoyed it more and more.  Some may not think it to be the greatest, but there is no way around the fact that it is the most influential jazz album of all time, and has shaped everything to come after it.
0385503954|3.0|I enjoyed the book, but as I was reading I kept sensing that I had read this before..don't get me wrong, I am not suggesting plagiarism at all...just the familiarity of the tone, the mood of the novels of Rumer Godden, a novelist of great popularity in the 1950s. Try her Episode of Sparrows, and then read Atonement with a different set of expectations and perceptions.
B000069AUI|5.0|This British band has so much to offer with their latest CD filled with fantastic beat, rich melody and voice. Every time I listen to ColdPlay, I am amazed at the powerfulness emerging from their music. One could easily get lost in it. Difficult to say which track is my favourite: &quot;Clocks&quot;, &quot;God Put a Smile Upon Your Face&quot; and &quot;In My Place&quot; stand out. It is by far the best album I have heard from any band in ages.
B00006LSM3|5.0|Rather than talk about which tracks are best, I'll mention the feeling of the CD.  George sounds very relaxed, at home with himself.  He's not trying to be someone that he isn't.  So to me, that makes for a very successful, honest record.<br />I didn't like the CD the first play or so, and I don't understand why.  But this is the kind of CD that magically improves with each listen.<br />If you waited for years for George to do another quality release, this is what you have been waiting for.<br />Best Line: If you don't know where you are going, any road will take you there
0060278269|5.0|This book is everybit as good as SABRIEL and even better than LIRAEL.  Almost everything that you learn in the first two books comes into play in this book, so if you are new to the series, I'd recommend that you start at the beginning with SABRIEL.  <BR>The story begins with a nearly successful assassination attempt on Sabriel and Touchstone (whose real name you learn later on in the story).  This event sets the pace for the rest of the book: fast paced and incredibly intense.<BR>You learn more about the characters throughout the story.  The relationship (if you can call it that) between Dog and Mogget is extremely interesting, and you find out about their past histories.  I had already guessed what Mogget was in the beginning, but Dog's past came as a suprise to me.<BR>For the most part Nix has tied up all the loose ends, but he leaves room for another sequel.  I sort of hope he doesn't write it though.  I've seen series drag out for too long and I wouldn't want that to happen to this series.
B00000J7S8|4.0|Diana Krall has never failed to let me down. The accompanying band conducted by Eddie Karam and Johnny Mandel keeps in excellent sync with Ms.Krall's impressive voice and command over lyrics.<br />This album is a must have for those who have a passion for contemporary female jazz. Highly recommended!!!!
0676973779|4.0|A wonderful book to be enjoyed by the whole family.  I have never read such an entertaining book.  Very enjoyable!
B00003CY6M|5.0|I know this film never will earn an Academy Award, but it is one from that kind of movies that is unforgettable and ideal for a great time. The theme is hilarious, ficticious but very well connected and developed, and cusack's performance is very good. And no words to describe Kate Beckinsale... Beautiful and a very good performance.
0679720200|5.0|The Stranger starts out with the main character, Monsiuer Meursault finding out that his mother had died.  Meursault was a low income hard worker who could not support his mother at home, so he sent her to an old peoples home in the country.  This was the first of his so-called sins used against him later.  At first it would seem as though Meursault wasn't sorrowful of his mothers passing, but Meursaults main foible was that of his taciturn nature and unwillingness to show emotion.  Later in the story he commits murder in a vehement moment of rage.  All of a sudden he is thrown in to a trial with a magistrate.  All of Meursaults little mistakes are brought to the attention of the jury, including the fact of his unresponsiveness to a priest and religion as a whole.<br />        This author did a great job writing this  book and showing how society can tear a person apart using small insignificant mistakes.  The author throughout the book shows exactly what Meursault is thinking plus his views on certain matters.  The author also points out the flaws of religion and how God is not for everyone and should not be pushed upon by someone.  I picked up this book not knowing what it was and enjoyed how Camus could fit all this into a book that is less than 140 pages.  It was a quick easy to read story.  It was insightfully written and give credit to Matthew Ward for translating it into English so well.
B0000640VO|5.0|In addition of the last review, I'd to say that Amelie is so mischievous and so charming. This movie is really to be watched without delay.
B00004T0UT|5.0|My favourite of the studio albums (if you don't count the soundtracks, there really weren't that many), this album was recorded at American Studios in Memphis in a series of sessions that were electic, bold &amp; important. Not a grab bag culled from miscellaneous sessions, this album is cohesive &amp; simply rocks throughout, with tough, bluesy numbers mixing with r&amp;b, country &amp; pop. You can hear the new direction Elvis was taking with his music that had it's impetus in the '68 special. Every Elvis fan should have this album in their collection &amp; an it's an excellent introduction to those not familiar with his later work.
B000002UVX|5.0|One of the greatest, if not the greatest Hendrix albums! Who Knows and Machine Gun are 2 of his greatest songs. Musically this is his best album. All his live albums are great, but his guitar work on this album, especially Machine Gun is magical! Buddy Miles and Billy Cox are far more better musicians than the Experience. Jimi, Buddy, and Billy just &quot;click&quot;. Jimi Hendrix is and will always be the greatest guitarist! I highly recommend this album.
B00007E8O5|5.0|Yes, I have bought both versions of this album.  And yes, both were well worth it.  I usually don't write reviews, but in being a music lover and musician for over 15 years something urged me to write this.  <br />That something was a great feeling of respect for Mr. Cantrell and his music.  The bottom line: Most likely the best Rock/Hard Rock/Metal album from the past 3 years.  Period.<br />Buy it, and share it.  It's that good.
B00005YW4H|5.0|Definitely a classic! especially &quot;Come Away With Me&quot;(featured in Maid In Manhattan OST), &quot;Seven Years&quot;, &quot;Cold Cold Heart&quot; and &quot;Don't Know Why&quot;
B00000IO4I|4.0|I wasn't looking forward to this movie very much, and it seemed to have a pretty slow start...and then suddenly I was drawn in.  I loved the plot and felt so sorry for LV, while at the same sympathising with Mari and Ray...and the ending was so tension-filled I was bouncing up and down screaming at the TV.  Normally I find Horrocks rather annoying but she, like the rest of the cast, was brilliant in this and I was most impressed by her singing.  The only thing is that I felt the film ended a bit abruptly.  Like you never found out how LV sorted things out with her mother.  It was a good ending but it just had some blanks to it.  <BR>I would recommend this movie to anyone who likes slightly grim social-reality movies, who is interested in singing, or is shy.  Check it out!
B00001IVOF|5.0|Man, I should have gotten this album a long time ago!  &quot;Hell On Earth&quot; is a definate classic.  For 1996 the beats are pretty phenomenal...definately nothing for the light hearted or the occasional hip hop listener.  This is probably Mobb Deep's darkest sounding album.  I can't see any Nelly fans getting into this group...and what's the problem with that?  Excellent lyricism.  This is  East Coast Thuginometry at its finest.  Get it!
0060926317|5.0|Wow, has this book received a bad rap on Amazon!  I thought it was fantastic!  It was not at all \\"new age rubbish\\".  I can't stand that sort of thing.  I found it to be down to Earth, yet uplifting all at once.      This book has stirred much contraversy because people think the author faked a \\"true\\" story and also misrepresented the aboriginies.  Well, Morgan never once claimed that it was true - that was for the reader to decide.  It was intended as a mix of fact and fiction.  As far as the aboriginies being misrepresented, this is probably true.  But when it comes down to it, she describes them as spiritually connected, loving, resourceful people who could teach us a thing or two about living.  Besides, I read this book for the beautiful story and will read a non-fiction book to study the life of the aboriginies.      I have recommended and gifted this book MANY times.  I would say 10 times in all.  One person did not like it.  The rest not only liked it, they LOVED it!  Including my 50 year old male cousin, my 30-something fellow Pilates instructor, my Mother - an avid reader of classics and a book \\"snob\\" and many others from all walks of life.  Please do not let the poor reviews deter you.  Buy it used and read it yourself.  I think you will love it!
B000002J1U|5.0|It boggled my musician-mind to read the clued out distaste expressed by another reviewer for Zep's r. section. As a bassist of both the upright and electric persuasions, I must take issue with this: John Paul Jones was one of the most talented bassists rock has ever been graced with. His imaginative, melodic and &quot;in the pocket&quot; riffing was what got me inspired to pick up the instrument in the first place.<br />Let's hear it from other musicians: Did Zep have rhythm or not? You bet your guitar/bass/drums they did. Case Closed.
6305692572|5.0|I must admit that the first time I saw this movie in the theater many years ago, I wasn't very impressed.  However, years later, watching it again on video (before DVDs!), I bawled my eyes out.  It was very romantic and a very non-traditional role for Meg Ryan.  Kudos!
B00005JL78|4.0|this movie is really good. Kind of feaky if you watch it alone. The story line is original. There is some action but there is also a plot, unlike some other movies. Its worth buying.
B000067CPX|5.0|Who hasn't heard of the Red Hot Chili Peppers?  However, their old headbanging, body painting ways aren't for everyone.  For those of you who listened to Californication by putting the cd on repeat on the final track, Road Trippin (not that i did, I air guitar to All Around the World with the best of them), their is finally a RHCP cd for you. Red Hot Chili Peppers made a name for themselves by producing their \\"hard\\" sound. However, this new cd has roped in a totaly different crowd, such as myself.  There is not a track on that cd that I do not enjoy.  Whether I'm driving, hangin out, or falling asleep, By the Way sparks just the right mood.  If you are not a Red Hot Chili Peppers fan because One Hot Minute, or Blood Sex Sugar Magic didn't do it for you, give this album a try.  And if you thought that they might be on to something when they released Californication with a few mellow tracks, then you will find that they have hit the jackpot with this one.
B000066NW0|4.0|I got the cd a week after it was released, back in July '02. I honestly didn't know what to expect, but I was blown away. The whole cd is awesome, and I think alot of people can relate to most of the lyrics, in some way or another. Avril is seriously talented and it shows throughout the entire album. This one of those albums that even after time you can't help but love.
6304346107|2.0|I might have enjoyed this more if I hadn't already seen the Gwyneth Paltrow Emma.  This one just doesn't capture the essence of Jane Austen's excellent novel.  Usually I can console myself by looking at the costuming or the scenery, but even that didn't do it.  I just kept wondering who cast this one.  Especially the actor who played Mr Knightley.  Yoicks!
B00006HBUA|3.0|If you are looking for a movie done in the spirit of the original Scooby series, you will be mostly disappointed. This movie is full of mocking, ironic, \\"hip\\" self-referential humor for \\"grown-ups.\\"<br />Irony was something devoid from the Scooby-Doo cartoons, it was part of what made them so endearing and long-lived in popularity. In this, it was similar to Spongebob Squarepants, a contemporary cartoon on Nickolodeon that is currently winning the hearts of children and adults. It makes one wonder if someday we'll see a Spongebob live action movie in which, for example, there is innuendo about Spongebob having substance abuse problems with Krabby Patties...<br />At any rate, in this movie the filmmakers have decided to mock the character of Fred by turning him into a smug narcissist. Daphne is now a helpless ditz frustrated by her own ineptness, Scooby and Shaggy are the victims of pot jokes, and Velma's high intelligence is lampooned.<br />The performance by Matthew Lillard as Shaggy is brilliantly performed and well-written; together with Scooby it is perhaps the one character that (other than the aforementioned pot joke) doesn't suffer from the kind of jokes at its expense that are lobbed at the others. He put a great deal of care into creating an authentic portrayal and it really shows on screen. Linda Cardellini plays an excellent Velma, but as with the other characters the script has her acting out of character for intended comedic effect. With a more faithful script she would have also been dead-on. Rowan Atkinson puts in a fine turn as the gang's client, although his small role leaves little opportunity for displaying his enormous comedic talent; it's a little like using a Ferrari to get groceries.<br />If you feel somewhat embarassed and self conscious about liking the old Scooby Doo cartoons, you will probably enjoy this movie with no qualms, and have a good laugh as the movie pokes fun at Freddie's clothes, etc. The filmmakers are embarassed too. For therest of us, it is still entertaining to see the characters moving around in real life, and the relationship between Shaggy and Scooby is the one bright spot that captures something of the original fun, warmth and camaraderie in the cartoon. Otherwise, the movie leaves one feeling a little unfulfilled, like they've eaten a hollow Scooby Snack.
6300248569|5.0|In this production the music is brilliant.  Watch the film again and listen to the &quot;conversation&quot; between Mary and the carter who is going along the road outside Longbourne at the very beginning. Mary's voice is represented by a staccato violin and the carter's replies are deep cello notes. Mary comes rushing back into the house and announces, &quot;I know who is moving into Netherfield Hall!&quot;  Then the oboe (I think it's an oboe, anyway) that accompanies our first sight of Mr Collins.  Wonderful.<BR>The production values aren't what we're used to these days (it's probably not a budget problem as some have assumed), but the script, the actors, everything is just so right.  My special favourite is Mr Darcy.  His stiffness isn't wooden, in my opinion, it's the pride he wears until Lizzie knocks some of it out of him.  At the end, when they're now engaged and are reviewing the previous mishaps in their relationship, he unbends to the point where he can't stop smiling.  It's a smile worth waiting for!
0789723107|5.0|This book invites you to read it cover-to-cover.  The information is presented so well, even a seasoned veteran will learn new tricks.  I seek books these days with far fewer pages than the typical &quot;Bible&quot; or &quot;Unleashed&quot; series books.  I demand well-presented, well thought-out content and this book delivers.  The author(s) also chose to include enough comedy in their material to make the book purely enjoyable.
B00005JKDR|3.0|.... Because what I saw was a high production film with more plot holes and predictable characterization than I can forgive. The dialogue by the various characters from heroes like Scully to the forgettable revelations that the boss was the bad guy was seen from a mile away. Snappy delivery does not equate to original stories or memorable plot designs. I do not own this DVD but I saw the film in the theater and presented as entertainment twice since then and there was that in flight presentation from Europe too which I studiously viewed it trying to &quot;get it&quot;. Did I like the characters? No. What was to like. Scully was a lovable lug with a heart, surprise, surprise. The big-eyed Mikey portrayed by Billy Crystal was also a character that's been presented over and over again as the selfish, funny guy who has a change of heart by the end (insert lovable smart-alec meercat from the Lion King, Jason Alexander's gargoyle from The Hunchback, monkey from Alladin, crab Sabastian from The Little Mermaid, petulant animated clock from Beauty And The Beast......), then the big corporate boss was the bad guy?! Noooooo.... really? Couple all that with a cute-as-a-button, prespeaking little girl who coos and ahhs and squeaks and is terrified by all those bad guys, but wants to be snuggled by the big blue Scully and you have a predictable &quot;hit&quot;. Of course people will love this. They're programmed to love it, and none too subtly either. Is it a bad film? No. It's fine. That's all it really is; fine. However when something gets the rave reviews this film recieved, I expect at least one good gut laugh.I'm not as hard to please as I might sound. This was a disappointment. So was Shrek. Maybe it's the highly rendered, overrated CGI that's the problem. Maybe it changes the way I view these predictable films. It's not dazzling me. By the way, my kids and my wife don't &quot;get it&quot; either. We &quot;got&quot; The Emperor's New Groove, The Iron Giant, Eldorado, Mulan,Lilo &amp; Stitch, as well as the more serious Atlantis from American animated cinema and several good laughs from the recent Ice Age. Compared to those, Monster's Inc is just a lot of the same old thing and not very clever, regardless of the stellar cast and the opinions of reviewers.Here's hoping it gets better with age.
0151008116|5.0|Life of Pi was an adventure I may read once again, I liked it that much. It is wonderfully written and very entertaining.   Also recommending: The Throne Room; by: Belter
B000002KDX|5.0|This record is a masterpiece! What a wonderful example of singer/songwriter, acoustic guitar driven music. It as is fresh today as the day it was when I bought the album in late 1971. Being a guitarist myself, I set out to learn this album note for note and I still can play it all the way through to this day! There have been very few records that have affected me like this one has. \\"Riverside\\" is a gem. You can't help but feel good listening to it. It is no wonder that America still opens their shows in 2003 with it. I have probably played \\"Horse With No Name\\" more times than any record I have ever listened to and it still gives me goosebumps. Dan Peek's \\"Rainy Day\\" is amazing. Gerry's \\"Clarice\\" definitely delivers with its amazing ending. Dewey's \\"Sandman\\" and \\"Three Roses\\" are brilliant and are still receive regular airplay to this day! The music that was dominant in the early to mid '70's is still my favorite of all time. Artists like America, Crosby, Stills & Nash, Jackson Browne, Eagles, Joni Mitchell, James Taylor and Carole King dominated the music scene then and I really miss the days when real singer songwriters were the rule rather than the exception. If you crave music that showcases harmony, melody and beautiful acoustic guitar sounds, do yourself a big favor, GET THIS CD. You will not be disappointed. After you get this album check out many of the others. They are all worth a serious listen. Man, I still LOVE this album!!!
1559409010|5.0|Okay, so there's been a lot of controversy over this film. <br />Admittedly, I am a big Python fan, and I think that all of their works are marvellous, but I understand that not everyone can appreciate the Pythonesque humour. <br />This film is probably the most different from the other works of Python, because this story is about one person, not just a bunch of sketches thrown together. The film has a nice flow to it, and focuses mainly on the one character.   <br />As for the bit about being blasphemous, you probably will have to decide for yourself. In my opinion it isn't. Christ only appears twice in this movie (giving a sermon on the mount, and his birth) and his roles are of a serious nature. The only scene which could possibly offend is when the ex-leper refers to Christ as being a &quot;Bloody do-gooder&quot;. <br />A quote from Terry Jones:<br />&quot;There was nothing funny about what Christ said and what's funny really is the fact that Christ said all these really good things about Love Thy Neighbor and everything, and then for the next two thousand years people are killing each other and torturing each other because they can't quite decide how he said it.&quot;<br />Think about that before you go calling this film blasphemous. This film has some very important morals that everyone should consider, and it never directly attacks Christ.<br />As for comparing it to the Holy Grail... you can't. They are both excellent films. They can both be very silly and very hilarious. If you've only seen the Holy Grail, and you liked it, then you should give this movie a try.      <br />Basically there are three types of people:<br />1) People who love all the works Monty Python.<BR>2) People who only like the Holy Grail.<BR>3) People who think it's stupid (maybe they're the stupid ones??)<br />If you're #1, then this dvd is great. It's great having the extra scenes, they're a real bonus, and in my opinion, worth getting.<br />If you're #2, and haven't seen Life of Brian, give it a go. Maybe you'll turn out to be a #1 after all!!<br />And to the #3's, you have the right to your own opinion. <br />A very funny film. The best thing about it, is that even though it has been nearly 25 years since it came out (well before I was born), you'll find that people of many different ages can still enjoy this film.<br />PARVUS:<BR>Get a move on, there!<BR>MR. CHEEKY:<BR>Or what?<BR>PARVUS:<BR>Or you'll be in trouble.<BR>MR. CHEEKY:<BR>Oh, dear. You mean I might have to give up being crucified in the afternoons?<BR>PARVUS:<BR>Shut up!<BR>MR. CHEEKY:<BR>That would be a blow, wouldn't it? I'd have nothing to do. <br />A very well written film, with brilliant acting from Graham Chapman, John Cleese, Terry Gilliam, Eric Idle, Terry Jones, and Michael Palin.<br />One of the funniest comedies of all time.<br />&quot;All right. But apart from the sanitation, the medicine, education, wine, public order, irrigation, roads, the fresh water system and public health... What have the Romans ever done for us?&quot;<br />&quot;Brought peace?&quot;<br />&quot;Oh, peace... SHUT UP!&quot;
B00003CXTG|1.0|What an unbeleivably stupid film. Full of corny and sentimental american ideas from start to finish.
B0000262QW|5.0|Everytime I listen to this album I am reminded why I place Stanley Clarke at the top of the pantheon of all-time great bass players. (That's right, Jaco gets second place.) Is there anyone who can rip on both upright and electric bass like this guy? Is there anyone who could do it and not have to give Stanley credit for setting the standard? And is there anyone more perfectly suited to complement Chick Corea in this and the later RTF settings? I submit no, and no, and no.<br />Of course, everybody on this recording does a superlative job. With the flute/piano combo, it's a jazzy and accessible sound, yet outside the box of the day's established forms. It's a shame no one is doing anything as innovative and alive, anymore (at least that I'm aware of.) When I listen to jazz radio, either locally or on the net, I'm struck by the predictability of it all. Sure, there are talented players, but everything is either slick elevator music or recycled bop, swing and blues. Where is the creativity of an RTF or Weather Report?<br />But back to the bass here. If you're a fan of the instrument, you owe it to yourself to hear Stanley shredding on the acoustic. You won't be disappointed.
0802130208|5.0|I don't chase after books squarely labeled &quot;Humorous&quot;.  This brilliant piece of work elevates the genre into world class quality. I approach books with humor as the predominate theme with less reluctance having read A Confederacy of Dunces. I wonder how many other books I've dismissed because I thought it wouldn't be my cup of tea? It's just one heck of a great read!  Toole's characters are perfectly filled out and I'm able to see the action taking place as I read.  Treat yourself.  Read the book.
6304698526|5.0|When I mention to people that Bullitt is one of my favorite movies, the common response is, &quot;Oh, you mean the one with the Mustang and the car chase, right?&quot;.  Well, yes, that is the movie that I am talking about.  However, I think that although the car chase is at least one of the best ever, there is still the rest of the movie.  I don't think that the car chase should be the sole basis for determining Bullitt's status as a classic.  I think that more importantly, it has a very complex plot.  In an age when theaters are overrun by cheesy Steven Seagal movies with comical plots, Bullitt is an intelligent action flick.  The various twists and character development make for a movie that is worthy of repeated viewing.  Additionally, good acting separates the keepers from the rejects when we are forced to sit through the likes of Chuck Norris and others.  Of course, the car chase is what Bullitt is infamous for, but just keep in mind that the rest of the movie has other qualities as well.
0142000663|5.0|The gem has it all.  Humor (you'll laugh out loud at some of the scenes), frustration, beautiful imagery not difficult to understand and ulimately, love.  You will believe the ultimate triumph of love and compassion we have for each other as family no matter who we're born to.  Let yourself see the pictures in your head Steinbeck gracefully describes as he writes.  It's not hard.  It's not difficult reading.  If nothing else, read the part about the one-eyed man getting hilarious, believable advice about how to succeed with women.  Great laughs!
B00006V9A0|5.0|this is a great cd even though I have not been a die hard nirvana fan until just recently. this cd pushed me straight into becoming one. curts work is fablous and I truly most agree that this ablum has all of the greatest hits the band has come out with. even though this band really resides on past history of popularity I still find that this band has not lost any of its talent in the punk rock genre that it is firmly placed in. which I believe shows that even though this band has long past died out. it will still be greatly arpricated by the older generation and acipated as a wonderful part of music history in the futhure. for what I believe shall be generations to come. its just like stuff like the beatles and rolling stones. it is simply to good to forget or just throw away. my favorite songs on this album would have to be the classic rock hit Smells Like Teen spirit, and Rape Me.<BR>but I shall not be suprised if in the futhure after listionin to this cd noumbrous times I will find many more classics of this great rock band. this diffently a good cd to get inot if you like old school punk rock. and if you are just a big nirvana junkie fan like me.
B00005V3Z4|4.0|I liked this movie.  Sad, thoughtful, touching.  It communicates emotional resonance in each glimpse it gives us of the faces of any of its characters.  Hints about what it's about?  What more do you need than The Last Temptation of Christ?<br />I found it deeply moving, a filmic poem as alien to rational thought as is the best work by W.S. Merwin, Wallace Stevens, or even Keats.<br />I guess maybe this review isn't very helpful, but this isn't a popcorn picture.  Rather, it's for one who wants to feel, to be reminded of the immediacy of life, and to believe that one really could change his fate--which is, after all, that each of us will die alone.
074322454X|5.0|I thought this book was interesting and unique in every way.<BR>It was so good, I wasn't able to put the book down until the end.  Band of Brothers explains in great detail what WWII was like in creative fashion.  I recommend it for any teen or adult to read.
B000068PQ0|1.0|It may reflect on me in a bad way, but I totally didn't get this record. I know the album has received just the best reviews from numerous reputable sources, many of whom I trust wholeheartedly.<BR>The reviews here on Amazon.com echo those I've read in more traditional print media outlets.<BR>But I just couldn't get through this album. It was boring and unappealing and uninteresting. Maybe it's me though...I see that many other reviewers have had to \\"go back\\" to the album to discover its' charms, but I just can't do it...<BR>I LOOOOOVE the title though...I'm the kind of music fan who's ridiculously optimistic. I hope to be transported by each and every artist/album I get. I buy a lot just based on reviews, if it sounds I might like 'em.<BR>This one? Like I said, I just don't \\"get\\" it.
B000069KE0|2.0|This album has always been my favorite by any group.  The sound quality on Rhino's \\"remastered\\" edition is pitiful.  My belief is that they played an old 33 1/3 and recorded it, since there are even skips in the CD version!
B00006LLNU|5.0|all i have to say is if there is a heaven, this is how it would sound
B00006G8G1|4.0|Rock In Rio is an excellent representation of how Iron Maiden still know how to pull it off.  The sound quality and video is the best live production they've put out to date. The only complaints I have is unless you have 5.1 surround you lose out on some of the sonic production... My other small complaint is that I wish there were more classic tracks.  I know Maiden have put out plently of live videos with all of the classics, but never with this quality.  All-in-all, Maiden live up to their dedication to their fans and have put out yet another must-buy.  Die-hard fans should also get their hands on \\"Eddie's Archives\\"...this should have been put out years ago...it is amazing!
B000002LUB|5.0|I dismissed this album when it first came out. I wanted Dio to be as lyrical as he was on 'Heaven and Hell'. On 'Dehumanizer' he's everything but that: snarling, angry, intense, bitter. It put me off for years. Occasionally a song from the album would pop into my head, but I never listened to it whole for many years.<br />I recently started working out, and I needed a hard-driving soundtrack. I thought of 'Dehumanizer'. It worked well. But, not only that, I began to get into the songs. That relentless, sharp-sounding agression eventually drove itself into my skull.<br />Just to pick out a few highlights:<BR>'Too Late' - A chilling storyline, building in tension until the end, when we see the fate of the sinner and understand why the song began with those echoing, plaintive wails of guitar. They are the cries of the damned man sinking slowly to his fate.<br />'TV Crimes' - a fast, exciting, down-picked riff reminiscent of early Metallica. I didn't know Iommi could play like this!<br />'I' - majestic and pompous, this is epic-scale metal.<br />'Buried Alive' - always better than you remember it being last time you listened to it. A great closer.
B00005JKCH|5.0|...As soon as it came out for dvd I ran out and bought it.  Anyone who's a fan of the comic books or has seen the cartoon will like this movie. It stays on track with the comics really well and the acting is superb. Great special effects and storyline, overall just a badass movie! Highly Recommended!!
B000021YQV|5.0|The first song i ever heard by System of a Down was Chop Suey, and at first i thought it was weird and i never took the time to listen to it, from beginning to end.Then my friend told me to listen to it, and i did, and i looked up the lyrics and i thought it was an awesome impressive song, especially to sing along. So i decided to listen to some other songs, then i heard Toxicity, and i also didnt really like it, at first, but then again i listened to it. <BR>   So the weird thing is about System of a Down, is that, i never listened to this genre before, and this band is has its own genre. <BR>   So after i listened to every song on the toxicity album,I became addicted to this band, I LOVED EVERY SONG...i like all of songs,and they are ALL catchy, i wouldn't skip tracks on this album. Unlike other bands that only have one or two good songs.<BR>  The first time i heard ATWA, i loved the chorus, and i also noticed how they can go from a sweet melodic sequence, to fast screaming, and back to melodic, which i loved. Just like in ATWA and Chop Suey. What's really remarkable, is how the Toxicity record does seem to be more melodic then their self-titled debut, which makes it different from other artists, which mostly have rhythmic guitar. System of a Down songs are melodic, but at the same time they aren't big on guitar solos, so that is remarkable.<BR>  Anyone who never liked Rock/Metal genre, has to try to actually take time to listen to some songs, they are truly remarkable. <BR>  As you are listening to System of a Down, you can REALLY enjoy the guitar, and definatly the drum sequences, and just relax, and try to listen to every aspect of the song, they are very enjoyable.<BR>  Every single song on this record, is excellent, but some are better, and each song, has its own mood, so this cd is good for any mood.<BR>  In the same year, I got lucky enough to attend a System of a Down live concert, In Montreal on July 31. I thought that they gave a really impressive performance, because their songs on stage sound a lot like their studio records. Which is rare, because unlike other genres, IE: rap, sound way off from the studio version.<BR>   With System of a Down, you can really appreciate the guitar work by Daron Malakian.<BR>   This record really got me into the genre of System, but their debut is more Rhythmic, and it is also Great.<BR>   Every single song on this album is really great,<br />Prison Song - A really hard song about the prison system of the USA, starts off slow, and has its soft side toward the end. Excellent for live shows. good chorus (i buy my crack,etc..)(8/10)<br />Needles - At first you might not like this song, but towards the middle it gets better, and is a really great song, once you get into it, Nice solo(8/10)<br />Deer Dance - A really good start, nice chorus, awesome song!(9/10)<br />Jet Pilot - This song is more hard metal genre, then other songs, but is still a good song if you like hard rock guitar playing. great for concerts(7/10)<br />X - This song is short, but damn is it good..It starts off slow, and speeds up right into a great riff, man. \\"We don't need to multiply, Die!\\" the song slows down and speeds up, but the guitar is really great.(9/10)<br />Chop Suey - This song is absolutely unbelievable! With an acoustic starts, it speeds up with electric guitar that rocks, and goes right into the screaming,\\"Wake Up!\\" Chances are you wont understand the meaning of this song, but thats why it wocks. Singing along is just great, and i love how this song sort of, slows down towards the end. My favourite part of the song is \\"Truuust in my, self righteous suicide, I cry when angels deserve to die!\\" because the keyboard comes into play and the drums and guitar are just remarkable. definatly CLASSIC(10/10)<br />Bounce - a pretty short song, that is pretty hard metal genre, and has a nice solo breakdown in the middle, overall, its a really fast song that yells pogo.Good riff(7/10)<br />Forest - Man...this songis good!just plain GOOD, it has so many parts, just excellent, a good way to get to know system (10/10)<br />ATWA - A REAL great riff, one of the best songs on the whole record, goes from fast to slow, just plain GREAT CLASSIC (10/10)<br />Science - this song is also really great, a good message, and just plain excellent (9/10)<br />Shimmy - A really fast song, that has a catchy chorus \\"i want life!\\", great song, pretty short, but just the right length (9/10)<br />Toxicity - One of the best songs on the whole record, really remarkable drums followed by great riffs, has screaming vocals, that switch to calm vocals.JUST listen, it is perfect.(10/10)<br />Psycho - you might not like it at first due to the start where serj screams \\"psycho!\\" BUT, this song is actually very melodic, with nice breaks like \\"so you want to see the show!\\", but the real best part, is after the last vocal, there is such a great solo, that you'll think this is the best interpretation of guitar ever! the best solo on the album, (10/10)<br />Aerials - Congratulation System, this song is nominated in the upcoming grammies next month. You might have seen the video, and realize that this song has a nice riff, i read on the internet that this song is about the beauty of retarded children and how they see the world. this might be helpfull to understand the song's lyrics. (10/10)<br />ALL of the songs are great, just because i gave a worse rating to one of the songs, doesn't make it officially worse, but it would be your decision considering the genre of music you like most. <br />For closure i have 3 words : BUY THIS ALBUM. It is the best of music out there. Period.

B000002OX3|4.0|The original vinyl was actually better if you lived in the United States,(that's the only time that this happened in the 1960's,)sacrificing \\"Heatwave\\" for the big hit \\"Happy Jack.\\" Oh well-the other nine are pretty good songs.  \\"Run Run Run\\" may very well be the best album opener since \\"I Saw Her Standing There.\\" It's one of my top three favorite rock songs of all time, up there with \\"Surrender\\" and \\"You Really Got Me.\\" \\"Boris The Spider\\" is next, the Who classic that never was. Moon is in top form, especially since it's his debut-\\"I Need You\\" features him singing. He has a good voice, and should have sung more often. \\"Whiskey Man\\" follows...[...] I miss John Entwistle. In America you'd now hear \\"Happy Jack,\\" which rocks just as hard as anything else on side A. Everywhere else, you get the super-lame \\"Heatwave,\\" which would have fit in better on the first album. That's ok though- \\"Cobwebs and Strange\\" more than makes up for it. Moon may have hated drum solos, but he really shines on this. There should have been more contributions from him on subsequent albums...imagine... Next we get three rather docile songs: \\"Don't Look Away,\\" \\"See My Way,\\" and \\"So Sad About Us.\\" The first one is a throwaway, I could take it or leave it. \\"See My Way\\" is a good song, just poorly produced (check out 'BBC Sessions' and you'll see what I mean!) and \\"So Sad About Us\\" is actually an outstanding song, which sadly fades away into side-a side-b album obscurity, just like \\"Our Love Was\\" and \\"Sunrise\\" from the next album. It's unfortunate, as Townsend could really turn in some good melodic love songs. Next is the mini-opera. The song, I'll admit, is better elsewhere...this one almost seems tentative at times. However, there are neat little production techniques (sometimes you'll have to wear headphones,) scattered throughout to keep you interested. The bonus tracks are good-for the most part. \\"Batman,\\" \\"Bucket T,\\" and \\"Barbara Ann\\" are neat little surf-style covers (surf was Moon's favoritetype of music,) and the rest I'd say are hit and miss. \\"Disguises\\" is again better on the BBC album, \\"In The City\\" and \\"Doctor Doctor\\" are fantastic...\\"I've Been Away\\" is hilarious, \\"The Man With The Money\\" is surprisingly good. \\"My Generation/Land Of Hope And Glory\\" is LAME...so's the acoustic version of \\"Happy Jack.\\" One can't help wondering why \\"I'm A Boy,\\" \\"Pictures of Lily,\\" and \\"Happy Jack\\" weren't included here as well. Oh well-as a whole I'd say it's great to play LOUD...but individually some songs (\\"Heatwave,\\" \\"Don't Look Away,\\") can't hold a candle to the big kahunas (\\"Run Run Run,\\" \\"Whiskey Man,\\") but that's ok-the boys were experimenting with their sound, making this almost a sample of the next album.

B000059H99|5.0|Rocky is one of the greatest movies ever made.  Rocky is the story of a not-so-bright boxer who does what he has to do to get by.  This is in to loansharking and hitting on pet shop employees.  At the start he gets no respect.  Then things start happening for the big goof.  If you want to be cool, quote this movie.  The best quote would be 'You want to dance pay the man, you want a ball pay the man.  Give me some money.'  This movie will give you hope and pump you up.  If you want to stay fresh on the scene go home and memorize Rocky.
B00005JKLZ|2.0|This 2002 cinematic version, supposedly of H.G. Wells time machine, is totally lacking in any of the charm of the 1960 version. As another viewer pointed out: H.G.Well's story is social commentary, and like the writings of Dickens, stands the test of time while pointing out the continued failings of humanity. To claim this cannot be protrayed in a movie version has as much truth as saying Citizen Cane whould have been better to avoided the subjects of greed, corruption, and averarice. Skip this version - buy the 1960 version.

B00005UEAR|3.0|I haven't actually heard Scenes from a Memory or any of their other works, so I'm not going to compare the two.  These guys have all the chops in the world, but I think they have a \\"showoff sickness.\\"  They do complicated things because they can, using blazing fast riffs and frequent (often unnecessary) time signature changes.  And the result is music that ends up sounding scatterbrained.<br />\\"Blind Faith\\" isn't a bad song.  That piano solo performed by Rudess in the middle of it is beautiful.  But it doesn't fit.  We're in rock... now, without warning, we're in a jazz solo, and then we're abruptly in rock again.  It takes a lot of talent to play it, but it would take a lot of restraint and good taste to leave it out.  And if the song as a whole can be considered progressive rock, it's hard for me to tell where it's progressing to.<br />\\"The Glass Prison\\" is good for about the first four minutes.  After that, it just sounds like noise.  This is in part because of the lack of fluctuating dynamics throughout the song; other than brief pauses, it's kept at the same intensity all the way through.  It can grate on your nerves.  Mike Portnoy loves this song, so I guess he can have his cake and eat it too.<br />\\"The Great Debate\\" is one of their more focused songs.  The instrumental portion of the song that starts about the 9:30 mark is very intense and exciting, and definetly one of their better ones.  If I were to show Dream Theater to any of my friends, I'd show them this song first.<br />These are just a few reviews of the songs.  In short, they're fun to listen to, but they could also play smarter, not harder.
B00006FDCD|5.0|The movie had a certain sense to it that only King could bring out in his writing, although directed by someone else, the movie like most of his other novels takes place in Maine. Maybe he has a conflict with his home? I gave it five stars based on how he uses the shape-shifting ability to grab the childrens worst fears and bring them to the surface, that maybe have been put away for a long time. Like me for instance i'm 17 and I don't have a real problem with clowns tell I see the movie and I just have a dfferent outlook on clowns. Tim Curry, (the clown),pulled the horror look and off beautifly, best choice, I think. if you wan't a well thought out, no running up-stairs tripping dumb woman, no-plot and one of the best scripts ever this is the, \\"BEST\\", choice.This movie got me started on horror maybe you.
B0000004V2|2.0|This CD is Not Great. Its generic pre-Oasis noodling.
B000001FI7|5.0|This is one of those cds that you buy because you like one song  but once you hear the rest of the cd you are totally hooked and can't get enough of it. I must have had this cd in my cd player for about 3 months straight now and I'm still not tired of it even though I play it over and over. It's haunting, relaxing tunes are refreshing from today's repetitive music styles of techno and rap and carbon copy boy bands.
B000035P7X|5.0|Brilliant.  Absolutely brilliant.  Being able to glance into the behind stage (and behind closed doors) antics of one of the greatest songwriters of all time is a rare honour (usually reserved for those closest to Dylan).  The performances show Bob at his best, and are simply captivating.  The archived footage of Dylan's performance of &quot;Only a Pawn in Their Game&quot; is rugged and honest...just Bob with his guitar.  Dylan, even now, prooves that all he needs is his voice and his guitar to get his message across.<br />The behind the scenes footage is the gravy for every true fan.  To be able to see him as a man (interacting with his friends, going through the motions of a busy tour schedule, and seeing the number of people that he felt &quot;responsible&quot; for) is refreshing and lets the viewer feel closer to Dylan.  Especially humourous is the scene that shows Dylan and Joan Baez in a car; Dylan reading a newspaper, and Baez singing yet another one of Dylan's songs (but this time, in a voice almost meant to imitate Bob).  He looks at her, and even though he is wearing sunglasses, one can clearly tell that he is annoyed.  Coincidentally or not, this is one of her last scenes in the film.  One can only imagine being in Dylan's shoes; trying to do something as simple as reading a paper only to be interrupted by his own song being slaughtered before his very eyes.  The many faces of Dylan are shown in this film...including the not so pleasant sides, but to love Bob is to accept ALL of his quirks and changes in mood (including those that see him aggitated and spouting &quot;gibberish&quot; in response to questions).<br />The true fan will love this film.  Only those people who already dislike Dylan to begin with (who are possibly ignorant of the musical genius, historical relevance, and &quot;ways&quot; of Dylan) run the chance of disliking this documentary...in which case, they really should have no cause to watch it...and are already too biased against Dylan to give an accurate, educated review.
B0000640VN|3.0|This is a light-hearted romantic comedy that is entertaining if you don't take it too seriously, especially considering the blatant omissions of time travel details.  Hugh Jackman is superb as the fish-out-of-water Duke of Albany who finds himself accidentally in modern-day New York.  Jackman demonstrates great depth and range of emotions, and his exceptional acting truly deserves a better movie than this.  Meg Ryan's character is actually quite unlikeable - I couldn't figure out why Leopold liked her in the first place - and her awful shaggy haircut is very distracting.  Fortunately, the interesting plot, strong acting by Jackman, and comedic talents of Liev Schreiber and Brecken Meyer save this movie from being an otherwise patchy love story and elevate it from being only mildly entertaining to being an enjoyable piece of fantasy.
B000002BYD|5.0|After the experimental sounds of 'No Code', this was a welcome return from Pearl Jam to their more original rock/ballad sound. Still, having said that this album sound very differnt to the other Pearl Jam albums.It is definitly the Pearl Jam album that contains the best collection of songs. Songs like 'in Hiding','Brain of J' 'Faithfull' are songs that dont sound like anything from 'Ten' or 'Vs'- the songs are more moody, innovative and less Rock'nRoll.This was the first PJ album I bought when it was released and it remains my favorite by far. I often wonder that if the band had promoted it better it could have been huge and PJ could be as big as U2 by now.
6301025083|5.0|Semi-autobiographical self-analysis mixed with fantasies in a movie?  It worked for Fellini to the point that it yielded him his third Oscar for best foreign film, the other two being La Strada and La Dolce Vita.  It's a unique testament to his vision.<br />The opening scene itself is memorable.  In it, Guido Anselmi is inside a car surrounded by traffic.  He tries to get out but can't, frantically rapping on the window, unable to breathe.  The occupants of the other cars stare expressionlessly at him.  It's a brilliant symbol of the oppression of society and conformity.  The allegory continues with him soaring into the sky and being a human kite, after which authority orders him to be brought back down to earth instead of being in the clouds.  How repressive!<br />Guido is a film director in his stride who's onto a rough start with his current project.  Yet his collaborator Daumier finds several flaws.  There is no fundamental guiding principle, no philosophical premise, and ambiguous intention.  One thing that Guido wants for sure is an angelic woman dressed in white, symbolizing innocence, purity, and salvation.  Ironically, in the end, it is she identifies his problem for him.  The reason why there isn't a coherent project going on is that the movie is more scenes from Guido's childhood, and many of those are played throughout the film.  He wants to make a film that is honest, helpful to everyone, and that will bury everything dead in everyone.  But does he really have anything to say?  In the meantime, he is hounded by his producer to stick to schedule, hire actors, and start shooting.<br />He also has a mistress Carla, who's extravagant, sexy, a bit loquacious, being at an impasse in his marriage to Luisa.  But it's the fantasy-world and the past that he retreats to in times of stress that's the real wonder here.  We learn of his encounter with the hefty and sensuous Saraghina, who lives on the beach and who teaches the local Catholic school kids forbidden dances.  The scene of having his own harem, full of the women whom he has encountered, is nothing more than a big booster shot to his male ego.  I need to daydream something like that more often.<br />In the scene between Guido and the Catholic cardinal, I found a line there that reminded me why I quit going to church.  Guido complains of not being happy.  The cardinal replies, \\"Why should you be happy?  That is not your task in life.  Who said we were put on Earth to be happy?\\"  He then quotes from Origenes:  \\"There is no salvation outside the Church.\\"<br />A question from Guido to Claudia, the stunning actress tapped to play his pure angel is also one to us all:  \\"Could you choose one single thing and be faithful to it?  Could you make it the one thing that gives your life meaning, just because you believe in it?\\"<br /> Marcello Mastroianni is well-placed as Guido, as is Sandra Milo as Carla and Anouk Aimee as Luisa.  Barbara Steele plays someone usually out-of-character compared to the horror films she did during this time, as Gloria, the poetic young fiancee of Guido's friend Mario.  She has a wonderful line:  \\"The cruel bees have sucked the life from these poor flowers.\\"<br />This movie was called 8-1/2 because Fellini had done seven films plus three collaborations in which he shot a short segment for an anthology, counting each collaboration as half, so he decided this film would be his 8-1/2th.  One of those movies in a league by itself.ces.  The scene of having his own harem, full of the women whom he has encountered, is nothing more than a big booster shot to his male ego.

B00006LJ72|5.0|I've been an Enya fan since the late eighties and I think she's wonderful! I spotted this album at B&amp;N and bought it on the spot!<BR>I absolutely love it! I have all her albums already, so this is only an extra tidbit for me. Yes, there could've been more biography with it but I didn't buy it to read, I bought it to listen to so I'm more than pleased. <BR>Anything Enya pleases me so I'm not going to delve into the why isn't this song in here or why was that song put in? Who flipping cares, it's beautiful music all the way around and very emotional and uplifting. And from someone who also listens to Nelly and Eminem sometimes relaxing music is the way to go!
B00007K08H|5.0|Like the star of Chocolat, the title character of this magical comedy also wants to heal people inside.  But this particular healer is a daydreamer with an irresistible smile, a Louise Brooks bob hairstyle or an Audrey Hepburn-like bun when it's tied up, and will charm the pants off the iciest of souls.<br />The only-child of a tight-lipped, hard-hearted doctor father and a neurotic schoolteacher mother, Amelie Poulaine grew up being too much unloved, with a not too happy childhood.  As a young lady, she becomes a waitress at the Two Windmills cafe, but other times spends her time in an imaginative world of dreams, not forming close ties with people, being terribly shy.<br />One day, she is watching TV when Princess Diana's death is announced.  From then on, she decides to be a healer of sorts, whether it be uniting a man with childhood memories he left in a cubbyhole in the skirting board long time ago, trying to soothe the hearts of people, make people's lives better, or being an avenging angel.  The scene where she helps a blind man across the street and describes what's going on is simply magical.<br />Amelie is also befriended by artist Raymond Dufayel, known as the Glass Man because of a disease that has given him very brittle bones.  They communicate indirectly through a painting he's working on, particularly a young girl that Dufayel's trying to figure out.<br />Amelie meets Nino Quincompoix, a man who collects discarded, frequently torn ID card photos from a photo booth and puts the reconstructed pieces in an album.  Included in there many times is a stern bald man whose pictures are always torn up.  Amelie finds Nino's album and wonders who the bald man is.  This is a mystery included in the film.<br />There's Colignon the grocer, an obnoxious middle-aged man who delights himself in disparaging his assistant Lucien, who's slow-witted but nice and sensitive.  Amelie feels sorry for Lucien and the scenes where she becomes his avenging angel at Colignon's expense are hilarious.  At one point she tells Colignon, \\"You'll never be a vegetable.  Even artichokes have hearts.\\"  Ouch, but well deserved.<br />Amelie's widowed father spends his life collecting garden statues to decorate his dead wife's shrine, instead of travelling around the world.  Amelie steals one of them, a bearded garden gnome complete with red pointed hat, and then something weird happens.  A few days later, her father receives a postcard from the gnome, who is apparently on holiday abroad!!!  This goes on for a while and completely baffles him.<br />Audrey Tautou would've been my choice for Best Actress of the year.  I simply melted everytime she smiled in the movie.  She also bears a slight similarity to another Audrey--Hepburn.  Both have in common black hair, a face brimming with charm, and irresistible smiles.  Maybe that's why it was love at first sight with me.<br />Director Jean-Pierre Jeunet uses some quirky film techniques, mostly visual imagery, such as a scene when Amelie literally dissolves into water.  The onscreen narration is also useful.  At times, it sets the stage for turning points in the film.  Earlier, it describes the likes and hates of the Poulaines and the one important characteristic of the Two Windmill employees.  He creates an imaginative film that's a breather from the usual Hollywood grind.  But it's his closeups of Amelie and her smile that make this worth seeing over and over.ense are hilarious.

0060278269|5.0|I was floored by Nix's mastery of story-telling. I was hooked through \\"Sabriel\\" and \\"Lirael\\" and the wait for \\"Abhorsen\\" was physically painful! I'm just in shock. These characters are alive and real. Lirael is so Strong and is a great role model for young girls. Girsl should love this and guys should too! I'm hoping (fingers crossed) that there's MUCH more to come.
B00005QZWJ|4.0|I concur that the music on this CD is beautiful, fantastic, and a masterpiece. And there's no arguing that this is one of my most favorite CDs in my wide collection of movie soundtracks. When compared to the actual movie score, however, this soundtrack really only dusts the surface; especially since the Extended Version came out. If you are a serious LOTR fan, then you've probably seen the movie at least 10 times, which is more than enough to notice all the music in the movie and absolutely love every second of it. &quot;Concerning Hobbits&quot; is one of my favorite tracks, but come on! What about Bilbo's Birthday party song? Not to mention that they skip a whole load of Moria music when they're running away from the Balrog. These are just a couple of examples. Maybe I'm just being picky, but what I look for in an &quot;original motion picture soundtrack&quot; is the ALL the music played in the movie. George Lucas did it for his Star Wars fans (yup, I have ALL of those CDs, and I love them!). There's probably enough music in &quot;The Fellowship&quot; to fill up four CDs, but I'd still buy it. That's what I'm waiting for. <br />If you're reading this review to help you decide whether or not to buy this CD, I'd say it's worth buying (it's gotten hours and hours of play time from me, but maybe that's because I'm still desiring more!). But when the &quot;Extra-Special Limited Edition&quot; comes out, buy that one too, and sell this one on ebay. Or keep it for the sake of your LOTR collection.
B00003CX8Y|5.0|excellent comes to mind when i look back on this movie.  great musicals, stunning character designs, brilliant score.  the only animated film to win best picture.  (then again there was really no competition)  i absolutely hated that pretty boy gaston. (therefore disney did thier job potraying someone stuck up) maybe it can be said that its thier best film ever.  but its heavily competitive against lion king. (the most succuessful animated feature of all time.  still beating out shrek). either way great film.  great dvd.  definately a classic.
B00007BH5C|3.0|After seeing the Two Towers for the third time, I couldn't get the theme of Rohan or Gollum's song out of my head. So naturally I went and got the soundtrack as fast as I could. When I finished listening to it, I couldn't help but have the feeling that somehow it came up short... Other reviewers have said this soundtrack doesn't stand on its own. Well, it doesn't really stand with the movie very decently either. So I thought about it for a while. Here's part of the problem I think: it doesn't follow the order of the movie. The tracks are all scattered here and there in some semblance of order, but when you think about the order of events in the movie, the soundtrack is all over the place forcing you to jump back and forth in your mind's eye. So forget trying to listen to the music in order. Hit the shuffle<BR>button on your cd player and call it good. However, there are some tracks that stand on wonderfully on their own: 1)Foundations of Stone, 6)King of the Golden Hall, 8) Evenstar, 10) Treebeard, 14)Breath of Life, 18) Samwise the Brave, 19) Gollum's Song. The rest is gobbledy-gook with redeeming qualities scattered here and there. <br />They must have sent Enya to the Undying Lands because she's nowhere to be found in the movie score, which I found extremely disappointing. Also, it appears you cannot play this CD on your computer, because when you pop the CD in all that happens is an oh-so-annoying screen comes up for the internet extras, etc. In my opinion, this sort of riff-raff doesn't belong on a soundtrack. The stuff that it offers you can easily get off the internet without its help. <br />It'll be nice when they come out with a soundtrack with the full, uncut movie score on CD (like George Lucas did with the Star Wars Special Edition soundtracks). Until then, our only choice is to content ourselves with small bites of elvish waybread when our appetite is screaming for golden-fried taters and fish! Can't say no to that!
B00001QEBQ|4.0|shan yu was the highlight of the movie for me.  the scary yellow eyes, the deceptive bird on his shoulder, the hun army, (finally theres henchmen that dont act like dorks.  a first in a disney flick.) perhaps the best since scar fron the lion king. i believe this was the last great traditional animated film from disney.  then they took a nose dive afterwards.  i go to art college and study animation.  this film and its villians are one of my inspirations.
B000003TAW|5.0|This album...I can't even explain how much I love it. I listen to it so much, I'm afraid I will get sick of it, but every time I hear it, I love it more and more.  Weezer is my favorite band by far, and this is my favorite album by them.  If you are reading this and are considering buying your first Weezer album, buy this one.  Every song on the CD is strong, unlike some albums where they mush together.<br />Numbering 1 - 10, favorite to least favorite<br />1 - Only in Dreams<BR>2 - Say it Ain't So<BR>3 - Undone: The Sweater Song<BR>4 - In The Garage<BR>5 - The World has Turned and Left me Here<BR>6 - Buddy Holly<BR>7 - My name is Jonas  <BR>8 - Holiday<BR>9 - Surf Wax America<BR>10 - No One Else - just because this song is number 10, does not mean it is not an encredible song!
0553106635|5.0|George R. R. Martin is a genius.  The books are more gripping, suspenseful, and shocking than any others I have ever read.  The atmosphere that Martin creates is so gritty and realistic, that you can't help but be sucked in, always guessing at what will come next.  And the best part is, you're usually wrong.  Martin is as bold as they come, never shying away from doing the unthinkable, and never adding any fluff.  His style is superb, his imagination is daunting, and his stories are more engrossing than almost any other author.  A Song of Ice and Fire and its composer are simply brilliant.
B00005N5RM|5.0|When hearing people swear by the classics of horror while giving newer \\"remakes\\" the cold shoulder by proclaiming the inferiority of their posturing almost immediately, I oftentimes find myself wondering if they actually watch the movies they make such broad generalizations about before commenting on them. I say this because  a movie in the \\"reissue phase\\" of livelihood will oftentimes find itself with a facelift that will make it a totally different piece for its predecessor, wearing not only a newer cast and script changes but also a new budget and effects to do the idea justice. This, in turn, opens something outdated to an audience that would be turned off to a colorless feature offering inside jokes to a generation they don't understand, granting them insight to ideas that would otherwise find themselves lost and that might help turn a viewer on to the idea of seeing a classical rendition of something because of a remade influence.<br />Such is the case in this reissuance of The Blob; a movie that keeps the namesake of something from an earlier era in film when graphic depictions of the horrific and the monstrous themes that empower the needy mind weren't actual allowed - without adopting its stance. In fact, I found it particularly chilling in some instances as bodies were dissolved inside that reddish-hued monstrosity and as some people met their fates in terrible fashions; an idea that slips well beyond the realm of the campy original and into the glamorous world of the terrible. In it, some people find themselves folded, some crushed beneath waves of gel, and others seem to take the Nestea Plunge into waters hungry with acidic undertones and appetites that make special effects fun. To me, that is what makes this film stand apart from its former titlebearer.<br />The premise of the movie involves a meteorite falling in the woods and someone being around to see it. Drunk and clearly ignorant of the dangers that all movie meteorites keep in their possession, our \\"patient zero\\" opts to prod at it with a stick until something comes oozing out. Further deciding that a stick would be the best offense to feed curiosity, he finds himself manacled in the lovely embrace of something horrifyingly delicious. Enter the town's local badboy, his need to play and subsequently wreck his motorcycle throwing him directly into contact with this drunken miser and with his attempts to remedy the invasive organism's attempt to claim his hand by trying to hack it off; a plan that doesn't hold much in the way of reasoning. This leads to a run toward a nearby road, the introduction of two more of a vast array of characters, and the carting of our friendly organism to the feeding ground called civilization. That's when the real fun and subsequent government intervention begins.<br />For anyone that likes movies with the dying always in earshot of their otherworldly hero (or menace, if that's how you see it), a storyline that can make one laugh at its bumbling and at its surprise ending, and that is saturated in gruesome spectacles, then this edition of The Blob is for you. It will not disappoint.ur \\"patient zero\\" opts to prod at it with a stick until something comes oozing out.

B00000JPH6|5.0|The Dark Crystal heralded a new age of puppeteering into the lives of many a young person and their easily influenced minds in the 1980s, showcasing not only the beauty of characters manipulated by a vast array of contraptions and the magic that could be woven on the loom of storytelling but also the dreariness that some legends hold within their epic grasps. This is one of the things I can clearly envision each and every time I look back in wonder on the tale of the Crystal and the \\"land that was green and good\\" that it lorded over, remembering how the thing came to crack and how the Skeksis began their rule over it.<br />We join the Skeksis as they gather in a time of transition, one that sees them ushering in a new era as their emperor dies and another will ascend to a place of power. It is also an era that will usher in a renewal of power for these reptilian/birds as well, assuring their reign for another 1000 years if nothing amiss happens before the stars and planets align. Everything seems to be going well for them, too, except for a little prophecy that states that a Gelfling will bring about the a time of transition. Still, there isn't anything to be worried about because all of the Gelflings were killed long ago when this was first heard, right? Well, that's when the last male Gelfling, Jen, enters the picture and the quest to heal the shard begins; one that will lead in down the paths of loss, love, and the conquest of fear.<br />As far as epic movies go, the Dark Crystal has it all. There are evils to be watched in admiration and their counterparts, the Mystics, to study under a cautious microscope for any sign of weakness, tiny villas full of \\"people\\" to see, jungles writhing with lifeforms both fascinating and bizarre, and many a support characters to enjoy. Also, the DVD version has The World of the Dark Crystal documentary on it, an informative piece in its own right, and a deleted scene depicting the Skeksis funeral scene. This all bonds together into one complete puzzle that is good enough for kids but is pH balanced for adults as well.into one complete puzzle that is good enough for kids but is pH balanced for adults as well.
B0000797IO|2.0|Watched the DVD last night and on my calibrated 50\\" HDTV this was one of the the worst looking DVDs I've ever seen. Most scenes were soft and flat, but the dark indoor scenes were the worst. Black areas glowed blue and all detail was lost/washed out. Really a shame since it's a interesting film with several  fine performances. I've checked with several others...and all share my experience.
B000075BFK|4.0|First let me say that i love Tupac's music. He is one of the top 5 mc's of all time...no question. The problem with Better Dayz is that most of these songs were leaked years ago and people are still trying to get paid off this man. There are tracks on here that still target Biggie and Mobb Deep. These joints are old and should not be released again. Yeah, the music to the album is hot but these are outdated Tupac lyrics....didn't he talk about George Bush Sr. and clinton on this joint....let the man rest in peace..da#n...
B000062YAZ|5.0|Wow, what an classic album ! Slayer's fast, heavy,dark  and most of all superior riffs are what draws me to them in the first place. This is what metal needs today. Need i say more ? buy it !
B00000JGHM|5.0|I agree with most of the reviews so I will not state the obvious...I remember Al Pacino (who lit the screen) saying to comedian Rick Harris &quot;Give me all you got...Give me all you got&quot;...that was so funny....classic movie..
B000000H3Z|5.0|What an album man ! I still  blast songs like \\"  inner self\\" ,\\"sarastic existince\\" and \\" beaneth the remains\\" ... Those songs makes this album  an instant classic. I would recomment this to any one who likes true metal but if you into nu-metal [junk] like korn , limp bizkit, linkin park and aparoach this is difinely not for  you because its  actullie good music and all  you little kids like stupid childish talentless garbage.  think and  learn !
B00006NSZ5|3.0|Yeah..the lead single \\"Lose Yourself\\" by Slim Shady was off the hook but that was the only stand-out track on the album. This should have been a classic release with mc's such as Rakim, Nas and Jay-Z on it..They are all possibly top 5. There were several good songs but overall....just an average soundtrack to an average movie...don't believe the hype..
B000000H3W|5.0|Sepultura's &quot;arise&quot; realy show  metalheads that foreign people can be just as good as them. Buy it !
6305263248|2.0|Man....I tried to watch this movie twice...fell asleep both time....it's boring and over-rated...shame in the great Robert De Niro...
B000002JOH|5.0|Im very impressed by this album. The production is right up there along with the heavy and dark riffs and the depressing &quot;this love&quot; kinda of a slow ballad that wakes you right up. I have to say my favorite songs here are &quot;Mouth for war&quot; , &quot; walk&quot; , &quot;live in a hole&quot; and, &quot; by demons be driven&quot;. Support pantera for their hard work and impressive heavy songs. Phil's lirycs along with his vocals are amazing.Buy it !
B00003CXAE|5.0|You know it's hard to fathom why any african american could see this movie as a classic. I mean for real, I can't relate to the 5o's and 60's like that and i don't like Rock-n-Roll...or do I..man, the music on this movie was great. Jonh Travolta was great which is to be expected. The song 'Hopelessly Devoted&quot; was so deep to me. I truly enjoyed the end of the movie and the song that they played..&quot;Always Be Together&quot;...we did that joint at my highschool back in 1993. yeah, Grease was a tight love story with a little humor...i gues i can relate...
B000062YB1|5.0|I realy do miss the days of old slayer because al of their latest realses seems kinda disapointing and boring. This is an amazing performance by slayer and it is worth every cent.  My favorite song ? &quot;dead skin mask&quot; by far the most brutal song on here. Buy it !
B00005JKCH|3.0|Spiderman was a lot of hype. It was over-rated and the movie just wasn't all that great. The producers could have did so much more with that huge budget. Maybe the &quot;Hulk&quot; will be better...
B000002JNJ|5.0|Pantera has not yet disapoint me with any of their realeses, i sure hope they keep bringing amazing albums like this siriously!   Im so happy taht we have great bands like pantera around   to kill  all of the trend crap bands like korn, limp bizkit etc... Buy it ! its good for you healph
0066214122|5.0|I don't know about the rest of you out there, but I think that this book was incredible.  Yes it's hard to understand and grasp the concept of hundreds of billions of nanoparticles forming clouds and even being able to form complex shapes (such as human form), but is it really?  I mean 50 years ago, no one would believe that in 2000, we would have computers the size of our palm.  Also, 20 years ago, who would've thought that soon there would be cellular phones that weighed as much 3 ounces and could fit in any pocket.  So now that we've evolved that much, is it really hard to believe that in say, 25 years, we could manufacture nano-machines that could perform tasks nothing else could?  The answer is no, it's not hard to believe, because in this brave world, anything is possible.  So in my opinion, this book is a great insight into the near-future of an obscure technology that could result in major improvements in medical imagery, etc.  This is nanotechnology...

B00006CXXU|5.0|A lot of people are being completely superficial in their reviews of this CD.  Those people are the exact people she is writing her songs about.  There is SO much emotion in this album, and she includes so many elements of musical style into her songs now.  I LOVE THIS CD.  I can't get bored by this.  It's great as a breakout performance from her &quot;pop&quot; image, which is exactly what her purpose is.  So what if she dresses a little trashy.  That's not the point, and that's what she's trying to tell you.  Great job, Christina.  Best CD of hers yet!
B00005AQE8|5.0|I got this CD last year. I must say that this CD should known as the greatest rap/hip hop CD ever made. Like before, 2Pac never put out a bad album. I think that Me Againts The World was a little better, but this is a must have. Its a beautiful collections of rough,sad,happy,and party songs. Guest appearances by Snoop Dogg, Dr. Dre,Tha Outlawz, Redman, Nate Dogg, Big Syke, KC & JoJo, Danny Boy, Method Man, Kurupt, Dat N***a Daz,E-40, Richy Rich, and more...<BR>The best songs on the album are:<br />-Ambitionz Az A Ridah<BR>-All About U<BR>-Skandelouz<BR>-Got My Mind Made Up<BR>-How Do U Want It<BR>-2 Of Amerikaz Most Wanted<BR>-Life Goes On<BR>-Only God Can Judge Me<BR>-California Love<BR>-I Aint Mad At Cha<BR>-Cant C Me<BR>-Holla At Me<BR>-Wonda Y They Call U...<BR>-When We Ride<BR>-Picture Me Rollin<BR>-Check Out Time<BR>-Rather B Ur N...<BR>-All Eyez On Me<BR>-Hevean Ain't Hard 2 Find<br />Songs that I didn't mention are also great.
1577311523|5.0|I love this book and I think it can change your life, but I'm troubled that I am seeing that Julie Norem is promoting her own books on other successful book sites to link her book up with theirs.  Shame on you.
0671027344|4.0|Nicely written.  The author captures something important about the voice of a teenage boy as he deals with popularity, family issues, sex, and drugs and alcohol.<br />My only complaint is that the revelation at the end of the book has become a rather hackneyed plot device by now -- how many novels have we read in which the cause of some problem is childhood abuse?
B000063WDH|5.0|Fantastic alblum!  I can't imagine who would not like this.
0195067142|5.0|Much has been said about the impact of the film \\"Saving Private Ryan\\" towards bringing the realities of war home to the general public. I must disagree because in the end, the medium of film cannot help but to be stirring; film is by its very nature is \\"sensational.\\" The personal memoir is a much more effective means of transmitting the experience of combat -- the confusion, horror, terror, and sheer filth of it all. WITH THE OLD BREED is unique in that it is a personal memoir written a (very intelligent and introspective) enlisted Marine. There a multitudinous memoirs by officers, and they can't help but have a \\"gung ho\\" flavor to them. WITH THE OLD BREED avoids all that, and focuses on the sheer physicality and brutality of war.<br />I cannot recommend this book strongly enough to anyone who wants to know what battle is really like, and why we should think long and hard before sending our sons off to kill or be killed.
B000001DWG|5.0|This is what started it folks.  One of my all time favorites.  From the music to the lyrics.  This covers a lot of ground.  I guess things happen for a reason.  I would like to see PJ cover some of the tunes.  I think they could &quot;revive&quot; them.  Sending people after the originals.  You only wonder what else they could of created.<BR>thanks
B00005YW4H|5.0|I was skeptical buying this CD at first- would all the hype measure up? I opened the CD and immediately put it in my car.  I did the usual scan through of the CD playing about 15 seconds of each song, only this time.. it didn't exactly work that way.  I couldn't make myself change the song- with every song I just couldn't wait to hear the whole thing.  This is one of the best CDs I've ever bought.  She's a genius w/ a beautiful, angelic voice. Do yourself a favor &amp; buy this CD.
B00003CXPJ|5.0|This is one of the funnier movies I can think of. Not only does it have perfect bone structure, but it is honestly the one Ben Stiller movie that I can stand. Owen Wilson is one of the funniest men alive in hollywood.<BR>  It is definitely silly comedy, in the vein of Saturday Night Live, but it puts movies like A Night at the Roxbury to shame. You won't learn any deep meanings of life watching this movie, but you will see a gasoline fight which is worth the price of admission.<BR>And you thought I couldn't eugugolize good.
B000002J09|5.0|This CD is simply outstanding.  Led Zepplin is by far the best rock band ever.  I have never heard a bad song by them, and i mean that.  This CD is no different.  ...
B00003CXTG|2.0|Oh dear God, where to even begin??  I can deal with Michael Bay's inane movies (The Rock, Bad Boys, Armageddon) if I go in expecting a summertime popcorn movie.  Why this man felt he needed to sink his soulless claws into one of the defining moments of the 20th century is beyond me.  This movie is so difficult to watch.  Yes, the explosions are very pretty, and the aerial photography/computer trickery is impressive.  However, all shreds of truth -- historical truth, personal truth, period truth -- have been shucked like an ear of corn.    It starts less than 60 seconds into the movie when a beautiful biplane rises gracefully (and in slow motion, of course) in front of a deep red sun with the tagline, \\"Tennessee, 1923\\".  Although I suspect they did have airplanes somewhere in Tennessee in 1923, they certainly didn't have this one.  It wasn't manufactured until almost ten years later.  This minor inaccuracy is only a shadow of things to come.  The biggest gaffe in this movie, and indeed in any movie I've seen in recent years, is when Ben Affleck's \\"character\\" -- a soap-opera/romance novel hero in every way, even down to the laughable name of \\"Rafe McCawley\\" -- embarks on his trip from New York to England to be a fighter pilot -- ON A TRAIN!!!  How this got past the editors of this movie remains a mystery, but clearly they should find other more suitable work, as trains have never run between the U.S. and England.    If they had diverted the budget allocation from just ONE special effects shot into rewriting the entire script, this movie could have benefitted greatly.  There were such regrettable lines as, \\"I'm not anxious to die, sir, just anxious to matter\\" and \\"I'm gonna give Danny my whole heart, but I don't think I'll ever be able to look at a sunset again without thinking of you.\\" (Why?  Her only sunset experience was with Danny, not Rafe.)  There are about 15 more such corny, lamentable lines, but you can experience those for yourself.  Even FDR's famous speechto the Congress has been altered.  Why?  If they took excerpts from it, that would be understandable, but to flat-out make things up that he never said?  Horrible.  And the scene with him rising from his wheelchair to teach his cabinet members a lesson about what can and cannot be done was just too cheesy and absurd for words.    Then there's the complete suspension of physical truth in Rafe and Danny zipping back and forth across Oahu during the attack (which lasted only 2/3rds as long in real life as this movie lasts) -- our heroes drive to one airfield, then drive to another, fly around there shooting up everything in sight, then fly to Battleship Row to \\"take care of business\\" or something ridiculous that Ben Affleck is forced to say, then immediately back to the second airfield, then to the hospital to give blood, then right back to Pearl Harbor to assist in the efforts to save the men trapped in the Oklahoma and Arizona, then back to the hospital... get the point?  They're amazing guys. How will the nurse ever choose between them???    As if these guys aren't impressive enough, they are then immediately tapped by Lt. Col. James Dolittle for a super-secret raid on Tokyo.  Never mind that he has crack pilots of his own.  Never mind that flying a P-40 fighter is completely different than flying a B-25 bomber.  These are just trivialities!  I probably can't blast this movie any more harshly than critics did when it arrived in theaters, but I'll say this much:  The biggest insult is the title of the movie itself.  It should be called something having to do with the actual storyline, like \\"Two Guys and a Girl\\" or \\"Life's Loves Lost\\" or something.  The attack on Pearl Harbor is just an inconvenient intrusion into a perfectly sappy, contrived love triangle.  No relevant or historically accurate background information is given about the Japanese attack, nor the Sino-Japanese war already underway in China.  The target audience for this movie is clearly adolescent girls(hence the utter lack of any realistic war scenes) who have only a vague, passing acquaintance with that little thing called World War II.    Bottom line: This movie is utterly shameful.  It's bloated, bombastic fluff, meant to touch on the fringes of light entertainment and have a big box office.  While this type of treatment is suitable and acceptable for large rocks hurtling towards Earth, it's wholly despicable to use the same formula on a historical event of such magnitude.  A full extra star for the music, though... Hans Zimmer's score is pretty good, and admittedly more moving than the script.  I'd never recommend anyone avoid this movie... it's not a total waste of time to watch, but it could have been so, SO much better.  The final nail in the coffin of this movie was near the end, an interminable hour AFTER the attack on Pearl Harbor concluded.  Feeling, I guess, a need to make the audiences feel like America didn't, in fact, get completely whipped on Dec. 7, 1941, the movie droned on for another four months to encompass the tiny, almost historically insignificant Dolittle Raid (which, true to its namesake, did little), then very hurriedly had our heroes crash land in China and get attacked by the Japanese with nary an explanation of why Japanese troops would be in China to begin with.  Remember, this is a Michael Bay film.  We can't be bothered with details!  There are explosions to film and slow-motion flag-waving shots to show!  Then a solemn voice-over intoned that \\"before the Dolittle Raid, America knew nothing but defeat; after, America knew nothing but victory.\\"  I'm pretty sure WWII historians would categorically disagree with this sentiment.  I don't know much at all about WWII, but I was under the impression that the Battle of Midway was the big turning point in the Pacific War.  The Bay and Bruckheimer duo struck out big time here.  This was subject matter that never, never should have fallen into their hands.

0060523794|5.0|This is a fascinating account, written by the man who orchestrated it, of the historic turn around of IBM.  In 1993, IBM was heading to extinction; mired in the tradition and culture of its own success, it was unable to respond to the pace and behaviors of the new economy.  Through relentless determination to return IBM to profitability, Gerstner sold what many would consider significant assets and developed ideas that were considered risky by the established wisdom.  <br />A significant section of the book concerns the work done to change the culture of IBM.  While this turnaround was the most significant to the success of the venture, it was also the most difficult to accomplish.  He turned the popular wisdom on its ear by exposing that \\"vision is not the same as \\"strategy.  It's very easy to develop visions.  It's the same thing as Babe Ruth pointing to the fences\\".  Customer focus ruled the day, with quick responses to their needs. Leadership was brilliant in understanding  that Service would become a vital part of the industry and became the niche that IBM was perfectly suited to inhabit. <br />\\"Who says elephants can't dance?\\" is a fast paced read, hard to put down and written in the style of a novel.  It holds the readers interest with unfolding developments and exciting outcomes.   I would recommend this book for people who are interested in the new network economy and the companies that rule the day.  Also for anyone in a leadership position, this book has invaluable support for making the hard decisions.

B00005IC2H|5.0|Undoubtedly this is an exceptional album if you can get into the music, but I've heard a few communicated misconceptions among certain parts of this album, which are somewhat 'secret.'  For instance, the intro and Avalon are done with the same instruments as everything else.  The first part of the intro is in fact the end of Agaetis Byrjun looped backwards, interestingly enough, and Avalon is Staralfur slowed down by 400%.  The interesting thing is that before someone told me about this, I sort of knew anyway.  Avalon feels the way it does because it's the same beautiful chord progression of Staralfur, just slowed way down.

They're very honest about everything and I can't help but admire it.

Don't complain about being discriminated, or brag about being better because you listen to other Metal bands.<br /><br />Hybrid Theory  is great, not as hard or aggressive as thrash metal or other metal genres, but it's still worth the time to listen to. All the songs are great, not one worse then the other, which is rare in any album.  Despite some criticism from long-time metal fans, Linkin Park lives up to Metal's standards.
3822855499|5.0|This is one of the more unusual books on my shelves, in that physically it is designed to bear a resemblence on its exterior to some travel guides.  The photograph above doesn't do it justice.  The material is kivar-like, and his famous photograph of the entrance to the Moulin Rouge is tinted in red and yellow.  Inside, the photographs are arranged thematically, according such topics as Salesman and Traders on the Streets of Paris, or Trades, Shops, and Window Displays, or interiors of Parisian homes, or, my favorite, Old Paris.<br />As the introduction of the book points out, Atget was the great photographic recorder of Old Paris.  It is to Paris of the turn of the 19th to the 20th century what Weegee was to lower Manhattan.  The pictures in this book are nothing short of remarkable, and to look at them for any length of time helps transport one, to the extent that that is possible, to a world that no longer exists.  This is not beautiful, genteel Paris.  It isn't the Paris of Proust.  It is more the Paris of Baudelaire fifty years down the road, the Paris of Toulouse-Latrec.<br />This without any question the finest inexpensive edition of Atget's photographs currently available, and since Atget is the predominant photographer of the Paris of a hundred years ago, the best inexpensive book of photographs of Old Paris.
B00006M183|5.0|Listened to Pearl Jsm for 13 uears now. They get better with age as I hope we all do. Anyone who wants a band to stay the same has a somewhat immature view of the artistic process. Experimentation is what keeps me coming back for more of PJ. Riot Act is what I was hoping it would be, thought provoking, something I could personally identify with, and rock like hell in the process.
B000002Q88|5.0|If you're looking for classic Kansas sound, you may be disappointed in this album. There are no compositions by Kerry Livgren, and there's no violin. Is that such a bad thing? Let's face it, I have lots of albums I absolutely love and only a few meet that criteria.<br />If you are, however, looking for a great album you are in for a real treat. This album, crafted in the likes of the earlier &quot;Power&quot;, creates a mood that is almost spiritual in nature, evoking mental imagery seldom found in pop music.<br />Although the songs on this album are not centered around a particular theme, there is an underlying thread which ties them together and carries the mood from start to finish. The title track and The Bells Of St. James still give me the chills.<br />The inclusion, once again,of Steve Morse taking on axe duty is nothing if not a bonus. His chops enhanced the emotion in every song, carrying them forward to climax.<br />Without a doubt, this surprising album ended up being my favorite Kansas album and in my opinion the best album of 1988. At the time, I could not believe this album didn't have a bigger impact on the charts (did it even make it?). Every person I introduced this album to was amazed. Although this album was released 15 years ago, it still holds up well today.<br />A definite buy in my view, even at full price.
B000056NX5|5.0|I was amazed at how other reviewers either loved or hated this production.  If you love JCSS as an &quot;opera&quot;, you should love this production.  I was one of the people who bought the original album back in 1970, before JCSS was ever performed as a musical, because I loved the music and words and the way they told the story.  The movie version was a giant stinkeroni, so it was with great trepidation that I tuned into this PBS version.  Was I ever thrilled, however.  I have never been lucky enough to see a stage version of JCSS (though I have seen at least 6 other Andrew Lloyd Webber musical productions in San Francisco, so I am no stranger to professional theater) but this is pure Webber, and the performers voices are fabulous.<br />My son, who is the same age I was when I originally fell in love with the record, says this is his favorite musical (and he has seen many live productions too, including Phantom in New York!).  It is not because he grew up with the music, because we haven't has anything to play my record on for many years - most of his life.  It is just because it is a great musical (believe me, he is not influenced by my opinions about anything!).<br />There is no question this is not your typical musical - it is more like Evita than like Phantom, and if you are looking for The Sound Of Music, which I also love, you will not like this - but this 54-year-old and her 21-year-old son give it 2 thumbs WAY up!

B00004RFFW|5.0|Gibson's got stamina, an ex-suicidal roman candle vietnam veteran who unleashes all his rage when Pleter Vorstedt said softly to him: \\"I pulled this mop of bloodsoaked hair to see this woman's face. Your wife, right?\\" Riggs lets all of hs fury loose on the cougar ants, to avenge the demise of his wife, (similar to Bruce Lee in the Chinese Connection) or angry that they might kill his Dutch sweetheart, such as when he iced that one guy, and said: \\"Master Race.\\" Gover's married, three kids, worried that Riggs (Gibson) is going to get the two of them smoked like a hookah, but his nervousness gives him that deadly, bad boy angry attitude.  For instance, when he picked up the nailgun and drilled those two South Africans, stops, takes a deep breath, and in a rugged, worn-out tone says: \\"Nailed 'em both!\\" Pesci's got an in-your-face, ranting, humorous personality, such as: \\"Everyone cheats a little bit, look at he Pentagon!\\" Or when he said: \\"See these these silk pajamas?  Free!\\" Murtaugh replied: \\"It's not free, it's taxes paying for it!\\" \\"Oh, come on, it's the same thing, okay, okay?\\" By the way, is that Home Alone, or moan on the phone?  O'Connor is pure evil, and builds up his anger,  when Riggs is reading his diplomatic liscence, saying: \\"Ok, you're Vo-Vorsh-enofk, ah, forget it, I'll just call you Adolf. His appearence extremely wicked, and his delivery of his lines and the look in his eyes when he was spin-kicking Riggs in the face on the cruise is 100% demonlike.
B00005KFUM|5.0|I bought this album while in the UK on holiday after hearing so much about from friends and I have to say that Muse are another great rock band. Although often compared to Radiohead I think they are a lot better, all of the songs on this album are amazing. With bands like this coming from the UK it shows us why the US isn't the home of Rock but of no name carbon copy pop bands and solo 'artists'. Put it this way the best we can come up with is ahem Nickleback and it's why the Foo Fighters are always in England and the Red Hot Chili Peppers sing songs about London.Come on we cant let them steal the limelight.
B000069AUI|5.0|With many artists that dont interest me, I have been searching for a band who sounds good and the lyrics are written well. I've found it! I don't know if you heard the first cd but I also reccomend that one in addition.
0316666343|1.0|Some one in our book club recommended this book. Alas I was not at that meeting and had read reviews on this book and thought   I would never read. I bought it and read 20 pages before I gave up in disgust. How it became a best seller is beyond my comprehension but what a great marketing exercise by the publishing house!
B000006045|5.0|This is the perfect after-hours disk for anyone into the club/rave music scene.  All of the songs have a beautiful flow to them.  The only songs that don't really fit are Teardrop and Angel; not to say that they're not good songs, they just change the mood.  Save the above, Mezzanine uses amazing downtempo beats throughout the bleak soundscapes, making an album very much ahead of its time; it doesn't overuse technology to make fast, and more complicated SOUNDING music.  It has may subtleties.
B000063UR2|5.0|\\"Legend\\" is one of those films that was really ahead of its time.  An epic tale of adventure along the lines of \\"Lord of the Rings\\", it really is unforgettable and features one of the most memorable villains in movie history.<br />The film is basically a fairy tale, centering on the struggle between good and evil.  Tom Cruise plays Jack, an elf looking to save his love, Princess Lily, after the forces of darkness kill a unicorn and kidnap her, along with the last of the remaining unicorns.  He must face the Lord of Darkness himself, played by an unrecognizable Tim Curry, to do so.<br />\\"Legend\\" really has everything.  It's, at its heart, a love story about a man trying to save the woman he loves from the clutches of evil.  But it also features a cast of characters that is almost too many to count.  Goblins, elves, and fairies populate the world of \\"Legend\\", making for a true fantasy epic.  The Lord of Darkness in particular is spectacular even when he says nothing, as he is both fascinating and terrifying to look at.<br />As I said, this movie was really made too soon.  The effects and sets are incredible, only matched lately by \\"Lord of the Rings\\".  The costume designs are incredible, particularly the Lord of Darkness and his minions.  In many ways, the effects are almost too good, as it almost overshadows the story.<br />That's not to say that \\"Legend\\" is perfect.  The acting, particularly by Cruise, isn't anything to write home about.  I think that was partially due to the fact that many of the voices are dubbed in.  Still, it's a bit disappointing.  There's also some characters in the movie that really serve no purpose, like Screwball, except comic relief, which is sort of inappropriate in this film.<br />This \\"Ultimate Edition\\" actually includes two versions of the film.  The \\"Director's Cut\\" includes the original score by Jerry Goldsmith, which is excellent.  This version is also a little longer, although it's not very noticeable.  The other version contains the original Tangerine Dream score, which is good, but is almost too cartoonish for my tastes.<br />The thing that really shines on this DVD is the documentary on the making of \\"Legend\\".  Almost everyone involved in the film (except Cruise) is in it, talking about the production, the set, and their disappointment in the final U.S. product.  The most interesting part is about how the sound stage where they had constructed this elaborate set burned down and caused them to forget about certain shots.  Ridley Scott is one of my favorite directors, and he very candidly talks about this movie from beginning to end.  It's really a treat for fans of this movie.<br />I would highly recommend \\"Legend\\" to any fantasy fan or anyone who enjoyed \\"Lord of the Rings\\".  It's a movie that really doesn't get enough attention from film fans and critics.
B00007E8V4|5.0|The mix of Rock, alternative, and just plain Weirdness defintly paid off with the last album. The best of the three, one you can listen to over and over again.
B00005JL78|4.0|I enjoyed \\"Minority Report\\" a lot, but it wasn't exactly the epic masterpiece that everyone has lead me to believe it is.  <br />The movie peers into the future, where an experimental program in DC called \\"PreCrime\\" has reduced the the murder rate to almost nothing.  Basically, psychics known as \\"Pre-Cogs\\" can see murders before they happen, sometimes days, sometimes only hours.  A group of cops then arrest the murderer before they kill and place them in a special chamber where they are put in stasis.  The problem is that one of the Pre-Cogs sees Tom Cruise killing someone he doesn't even know, so he has just a few days to figure out who this person is and why he's going to kill him.  <br />Cruise is very good in this movie.  He really does a nice job playing a character who's beliefs are shattered and who now has to try and disprove the very system he has staunchly defended.  The other actors in this movie are also excellent and very nicely convey the storyline and the emotions involved in it.<br />The picture of the future that Spielberg paints is not quite as fantastic as it was in \\"AI\\", but it still is interesting to see.  My favorite is how street ads and computers in stores can scan your eyes and pitch things to you by using your name.  It sort of shows how public our information is becoming.  The other effects are also very well done, although you'd think the machine that the Pre-Cogs feed their visions into would do more than carve names into two balls of wood, but I digress.<br />My main problem with this movie is that it gets too preachy at points in an effort to convey the message of \\"innocent until proven guilty\\".  There's a scene where Cruise is giving a government official a tour of the base and they get into a huge philosophical debate, even bringing the Bible into the mix.  Later scenes are similar and sometimes make you feel that you're watching a propoganda film.  <br />Otherwise, it's an entertaining movie with a few plotholes (like why is his ex-wife MIA for over half the movie and then suddenly become a major player), but, like I said, it's not the epic that some have portrayed it to be.
B000005JA8|1.0|I have to admit, I was intrigued by the variety and number of hate-filled reviews for this album, and that was pretty much the only reason I bought it.  Surely, this must be the modern equivalent of Varese.  I wasn't really expecting it to be immediately accessible, nor did I think that it would sound like popular music at all.  The problem is, I couldn't get this thought out of my head: what would an album sound like if it was made by people who truly had NO musical skill?  The answer, of course, is exactly like this.  Sorry, mates, but this is truly deserving of one star, and even that is slightly generous.
B00005Q4CS|5.0|Requiem for a Dream is a harrowing book, written in 1978, by the great Hubert Selby, Jr.  It follows the skewed ambitions and downfall of four people in Brighton Beach, Brooklyn from their various addictions, ranging from television to heroin. <br />The story was brought to the screen in 2000, directed by Darren Aronofsky, one of a host of young, innovative (P.T. Anderson, Spike Jonze, etc.) American directors.<BR>Using an extension of the innovative camera and editing techniques first glimpsed in his first feature, the black and white \\"Pi\\", Aronofsky, also co-writer (with Selby, who cameos late in the film as a taunting corrections officer), captures like no one before him, the utter self-inflicted hell of addiction. <BR>Except for Tyrone's (Shawn Wayans) joints being smoked, the use of drugs are shown using a fast-edit technique backed by a short hip-hop barrage, leaving the viewer to wallow in the harrowing after-effects of these lives coming unravelled - with absolute zero glamorization.  <BR>The filmed story is told very much as Selby wrote it, in a powerful way rare to \\"book-to-film\\" translations with absolute respect to the author's vision. It is a hard, blunt vision to view and it's impossible not to be affected by the gripping tale. <BR>The acting is phenominal.  Ellen Burstyn, as Sarah Goldfarb, will break your heart.  Jared Leto and Jennifer Conolley are mesmerizing as the drug-addicted Harry Goldfarb and Marion.  The big surprise for me was Shawn Wayans, who broke out of his clownish WB persona to deliver a wonderful performance.<BR>The film swallowed me whole, pure and simple.<br />The film was rated NC-17 in theaters and I believe this was a mistake.  If there was ever a true anti-drug statement than should be viewed by older children, this film is it...whether it strives to be or not.
B0000640SA|5.0|Ever since i read the plot synopsis in the newspaper, I knew i had to see this movie. I was a bit skeptical though. How good could it be, taking place in reverse chronological order. Would it use this &quot;gimmick&quot; as a crutch, relying on the viewer to ignore a hollow plot and/or characters becuase of this unique setup? The answer to all these questions is a resounding NO. It amazed me how not only this movie remained cohesive, but also offered intriguing characters, and still managed to throw in a twist ending (or should i say beginning)that was actually a good twist ending. I have the special edition and watched the hidden version that takes place in actual chronological order (which should only be watched once youve seen it how it was meant to be watched) and it was still a good movie. You cant say that about any other film that I know of. Please please please watch this movie.
B0000640VO|5.0|According to the American trailers for Amelie, 120 reviewers called this one of the best movies of the year.  Well, make that 121.  Amelie goes beyond the whimsical into the absolutely fantastic.  With humor and poignancy, the story unfolds.  Amelie is the lonely child of a distant father and neurotic mother.  As she stands childlike in the midst of a young adulthood, she observes human tragedy from the window of her apartment.  Upon finding a box of children's treasures in the dark space behind the wall of her bathroom, she begins to try to find the person who would have put it there.  This is the beginning of her emergence as a would-be fairy godmother, and her deeds become the portal by which she may be able to join with the rest of the human race as one of them.<br />The film is magnificently beautiful, and the casting perfect.  Tautou combines the self-knowledge of an introspective young woman with the disingenuousness of an imaginative loner to create an unforgettably charming character.<br />The DVD is rich with extra features.  What I found particularly compelling was Tautou's audition clip, as the actress seemed so much more contemporary and earthy than the character, but then was able to slip on a coat of whimsy even at that early stage.  Also noteworthy is the interview with director Jean-Pierre Jeunet, who says that he aims to make stories about the extraordinary rather than the ordinary (think City of Lost Children).  All in all, this is an excellent film and a great purchase...something I think I'll be watching over and over again.

B00000JY1X|5.0|I read of Stephin Merritt, the Magnetic Fields, and 69 Love Songs in the New York Times Magazine a year or two ago. I was enthralled by the concept... so, after far too long, I bought the box set. The only regret I have is not purchasing it the day it was released.<BR>Stephin Merritt must be one of the most brilliant songwriters the world has ever housed. One would expect that, out of 69 songs, at least a few would be... bad. By some miracle of unfailing creativity, Merritt has written 69 GOOD songs. Each is memorable, and the tunes range from upbeat to melancholy to insane to strangely sensible. There's a &quot;punk&quot; song, an &quot;experimental&quot; song, country songs, pop songs, alternative songs, showtune-esque songs, songs inspired by various countries' styles... everything. Scarily, every disc is about as good as the others (so often I find myself listening to one cd of a box set and ignoring the others). This set is, quite literally, flawless.<BR>Merritt's lyrics are ironic, hilarious, and meaningful. Those of us who yearn for music that makes one think (in this world of so much shallow &quot;musical&quot; garbage) can rejoice at his ingenuity and depth. Merritt is the primary singer in 44 of the songs, and his crazy-low voice never gets tiring. The other singers are equally talented, and the musicianship is astounding. Though the lyrics are my favorite part, I am blown away by the skill exhibited by all members of the Magnetic Fields.<BR>I'd list good songs, but that would take far too much space. Honestly, if I tried to pick 5 or even 10 favorites I would fail miserably. This work is brilliant. Amazing. Stupendous. All of the above. Et cetera.<BR>Buy the box set, because it comes with such a lovely interview book that I practically want to cry with glee. Merritt talks about the inspirations for each of his songs, his life, random things... it's nearly as delightful as the music.<BR>Unless you have a strange phobia of insanely good music, you MUST buythis box set. It's easily worth as much as 10 of your other cds, combined. Do yourself a favor and shell out 40 bucks for some of the most glorious music you will ever hear.
6305165912|5.0|Though it's not for everyone, those who do find the Big Lebowski funny find it extremely funny. What makes this movie so good is not the plot, but the well written charcters that drive it. You have the Dude, a lovable slacker/stoner, his best friend and bowling buddy Walter, a Vietnam vet that serves as his near-complete contrast:  the yin to the Dude's yang if you will. Then we have Jesus Quintana, a convicted pedophile and bowling rival whose brief but brilliant presence in the film testifies not only to how ingenious the Coen brothers are but how excellent of an actor John Tuturro is (he has a screen time of about 3 minutes yet is one of the most memorable characters). Another highlight of the film is the pair of incredibly shot dream sequences the Dude experiences, both incorporating bowling in some twisted way. If you know good comedy when you see it, I assure you that you will ove this movie.
0060934913|5.0|If you've never known a chef, and for most of my life I didn't, you have no idea what goes on back there in the kitchens of your favorite restaurants. Mr. Bourdain made the rounds when this book first came out, warning about Sunday brunches and when NOT to order fish, but this book is really more of an autobiography of a chef, and includes all the drugs, drink, crime, etc that accompany that lifestyle. Exceptionally well-written and honest, this book will fascinate the outsider and ring 100% true to the insider. Not for the faint of heart, anyone who appreciates good, edgy writing will appreciate the story.
B00003W8NM|4.0|Fincher has done it again! Many of you think this is just some knockaround-violent film but there's a lot of wisdom in this movie. Tyler Durden may seem like just a macho bar brawler, but after seeing this film you might just call him a genius.  You must watch this movie with the right mindset, it's the gateway to our souls.
B000068PQ0|5.0|Where to begin. How do you follow up the albulm of your career. Duh. Make a record about a little girl named Yoshimi and how she must battle pink robots in order to save the known world. But people who take the title and songs at face value are obviously fools. Hidden beneath each song is a layer of sadness that radiates into one giant message. Once you listen to the albulm as a whole you realize that you are in the hands of a master. The Lips make even the quirkiest of moments bittersweet and meeningful.  The first song alone, \\"Flight Test\\", proves just what a major talent  Coyne is as a lyricist. He sems to make the impossible, possible. He makes us care for little Yoshimi as she battles the robots and eventually wins. Only later do you find that the best record of 2002 was really a giant message of how to find the courage too love in the face of death. I would dare any other band in todays music scene to be brave enough to build a record of such possibilities! I simply can not say enough nice things about this masterpiece!!!!!!!!!
0060920084|5.0|I love this book. It was the first Bill Bryson book I ever read, and it's still my favorite (just barely squeaking by A Walk In The Woods).<br />I have a love for the offbeat, and quite frankly, Bill's travels in the book are like my dream vacation. If it's kitschy, I want to see it. If it's famous, more so.<br />Because of this book, I once travelled 2 hours by car while on a business trip to Michigan so I could visit the Henry Ford Museum and Greenfield Village. If Bill hadn't written so lovingly about it, I might not have thought of it when I was on the trip. This is now MY favorite museum as well. Thanks Bill! Keep writing!
B00006JL1Z|3.0|I purchased this CD because it contained most of the Fleetwood Mac songs I enjoyed as a young teen. However, when I listened to it, I was a little disappointed.  Although all of the songs have been remastered on this album, it is not perfect.  The quality of the recordings are sterile.  In otherwords, they are clean with no distortions or noise, but they lost that foot taping musicality that could be found on their old record albums as well as some of their older CDs.  It's a great album because of the collection of songs, but I wish that it retained the musicality and dynamics of the older recordings.
B00000255F|5.0|I listen to a lot of music--and I do mean a lot--and I must say that I've encountered few albums that can rival Born to Run as a work of rock and roll.  This album is a history-maker for a lot of reasons, but the most notable of those is the fact that it captures the essence of Bruce Springsteen's success.  Some pop artists can write catchy songs that get radio play, and some musicians can write songs with deep or complex meaning, but very few can compose with as much depth and appeal as Sprinsteen at his height.  This is one of those moments.<br />The CD is stacked back to front with great songs.  The title track, Backstreets, Tenth Avenue Freeze Out, and Jungleland are probably the most noteworthy examples, but truthfully there isn't a weak point in this album's lineup.  The arrangement is masterful, carefully maintaining a flow throughout all the songs and a consistent motif.  Like most of Springsteen's albums (all of them after Wild and Innocent, I believe), this one has a clear theme--the hope of youth--and that theme is well expressed.<br />Normally, I spend my time in these reviews citing the shortcomings of a product to warn off buyers who might potentially have a hard time with it, but I really don't have any of those to rest on with this.  The CD isn't a masterpiece--the fact that Bruce does the singing would be enough to deprive it of that distinction all by itself (he really has absolutely no vocal talent at all, does he?)--but it is solid, and among the top ten rock albums of all time (putting it in some pretty rarified air, along with other monuments like &quot;Let It Bleed&quot;).  If you can stand Springsteen's singing, you should buy this album.  That's all there is to it.
1572522089|5.0|This movie is a masterpiece. But it's not for people who are looking for light entertainment. Based on Shakespeare's King Lear, the film may leave you with a feeling that there's no hope left in the world. The battle and massacre scenes at one of the castles are stunning. It's what I imagine Dante's Inferno would look like. And the images of the old lord leaving the burning castle are truly unforgettable. <br />Tatsuya Nakadai plays the lead character, Lord Hidetora. He starred in dozens of movies, many of them classics. But he gives perhaps his finest performance in Ran. It's also worth seeing this movie just to watch Lady Kaede, played by actress Mieko Harada. She is the one person everyone will remember. Kurosawa has a knack for creating female characters who can make their macho samurai husbands look like wimps. If you've ever seen Throne of Blood, then you'll know what I'm talking about. The scene where Kaede finds a bug on the floor is not to be missed.
B0000025D0|5.0|Without a doubt, this is one of Bruce Springsteen's top three albums, and among the top twenty or so rock albums ever produced.  You'll find some disagreement among fans as to where it ranks within those ranges, but the simple fact is that this is a great piece of music, and one that any fan should definitely own.<br />For my part, I consider Born in the U.S.A. to be a little better in production terms and as an artistic work, but I must admit that since I got this CD two and a half weeks ago, it has grown on me in an alarming fashion.  We all know that Springsteen singing sounds like an elephant choking on a leopard, but, strangely enough, this album USES that frustrated, disgruntled howl of his.  I can think of nobody else who could perform &quot;Adam Raised a Cain&quot; as well as Bruce does here.<br />As with most of the albums he released after Wild and Innocent, this collection has a theme, and that theme is one of disappointment and disillusionment.  He mixes the best of his songwriting talent on this record as well, combining his knack for writing catch tunes about otherwise depressing subjects (see Born in the U.S.A.) in songs like &quot;Badlands&quot; with his talent for morose baladeering in pieces like &quot;Racing in the Streets.&quot;  The arrangement is nothing short of superb, with each song blending into the next without becoming boring or repetitive in tone and pacing.<br />On the whole, there's not much I can say is wrong with this album.  It's got all the usual Bruce Springsteen problems (1.  His voice; 2. Somewhat short, repetitive choruses), but those don't add up to much in the face of the brilliant artistic work presented here.  Any Springsteen fan should own it, as should most any music enthusiast.
B00006RU5B|5.0|Many were skeptical about the collaberation between former Soundgarden vocalist Chris Cornell and the three remaing members of Rage Against the Machine, Tom Morello, Tim Commerford, and Brad Wilk) just months after the intial announcement was made about Civilian.  It wasn't too long that they broke up, but only temporarly.  Now that this collaberation has been repackaged and went under a new name, now comes a brilliant self-titled album by Audioslave.  <br />The thrill of Rage Against the Machine and the intense vocals of Soundgarden is all captured in Audioslave as shown by the first track, &quot;Cochise&quot;.  It's not so hard to see that this single is a good display of music performance and immediately made its claim to fame after being played on radio.  Let's not forget about the other tracks such as &quot;Like a Stone&quot; and &quot;Bring Em' Back Alive&quot;.  It's song-after-song of explosive, sonic sounds and originality.  Not only does this album pleases both Rage Against the Machine and Soundgarden fans, but also new fans to come.  <br />In conclusion, Audioslave's self-titled shows a bright future ahead for the band.  Every band member in Audioslave have put their out most effort into this album and came out to be a success.
0385720920|3.0|This is a very quick read. If you spend more than two days on it, I'd be surprised. The pace of this story makes it easy to consume, and like a thick chocolate milkshake, you'll be loving it while it's going down, then feel maybe a little yucky the next day. The characters are fascinating because you wonder if such people really exist or if they are just semi-monsters created in Palahiuk's mind. One thing about Palahniuk, his characters are consistent, so a creep is a creep throughout. There is a shot at some redemption/healing stuff going on here at the end, with one of the characters, an ex-sex addict who collected a large rock each day he didn't jerk off, that seems perhaps a touch out of place, but is necessary for Palahniuk to tie together the threads of his ideas. Not a \\"deep\\" book per se, fun to read and thought-provoking in some respects. Quick and (relatively) painless.
6304118392|5.0|I must admit I am biased, as I have evry one of Oliver Stone's films, either as a screen writer or director.<br />I have just finished watching &quot;Natural Born Killers&quot; once again, and am compelled to advise potential customers to buy it. <br />The story of Mickey and Mallory is a dark satire not seen since Warren Beatty's &quot;Bonnie and Clyde&quot; of 1967.<br />What a searing indictment of American pop culture. Stone is not really American in his feel for cinema, but European. I personally think that is why he makes so many Americans uncomfortable.<br />20 years from now, people will still be discussing &quot;Natural Born Killers&quot;, as well as the rest of Stone's work. At least you can say it is not the usual Hollywood drivel.<br />Jeffrey P. Woloson
0767811038|5.0|I have seen Starship Troopers as well as reading the book by Robert Heinlein, and unlike those who might tell you not to waste your money if you've already read the book, I would actually recommend that course of action.  Why, you might ask?  One reason I recommend this movie is because of what it did for me--it led me to buy the book.  I had heard Heinlein's name mentioned in connection with other s/f series before, but until seeing Starship Troopers on VHS I had never felt any urge to actually sit down and read his works.<br />Another reason I recommend this movie is because I find it fascinating on several levels: 1) As a special effects-laden extravaganza; 2) As a satirical adaptation of a sci-fi master's work; and 3) As just an enjoyable, mindless fluff-fest.  Somehow Paul Verhoeven managed to work all three elements into one movie, a nearly impossible task in the world of moviemaking, and he carries it off brilliantly.  For those who have read the book and found themselves not liking the movie, I would definitely recommend watching it as a mindless fluff-fest.  You'll enjoy it much better that way.

B0000039PW|5.0|This is most definitley the best CD every made- BIGGIE is a lyrical genious and should go down as one of the best artists of all time
B000002J09|5.0|Yes, I noticed a couple reviews giving this album one star.  Wow!  Anyone who can give this album one star might as well call &quot;Nevermind&quot; (Probably my most beloved album) or &quot;Are You Experienced?&quot; a waste of time.  The forth Led Zeppelin album is one of Zeppelin's best cds and it conceals there best song &quot;Stairway to Heaven&quot; (And Rock's best song for that matter).  Heck, this epic of a song is worthy of the price of the album alone.  However, EVERY SONG on this album gleams with genious (More or less on &quot;Four Sticks&quot;).  Beginning with &quot;Black Dog&quot; which is one hell of a rock anthem to &quot;Rock and Roll&quot; to &quot;Misty Mountain Hop&quot; and on to &quot;When the Levee Breaks&quot;, which makes John Bonham seem like a thunder god, this album shows how great Led Zeppelin can really be.  EVERY Led Zeppelin album is brilliant but something about this album is more than brilliant it's breathtaking.  So those who know any thing about music will enjoy this album if not fall in love with it.  If you don't have it BUY IT!
0786915749|5.0|I read these books when I was younger, when I read fantasy for the action, and I hated them.   I gave them another try when I was older, starting with Dragons of Autumn Twilight, and I fell in love.  This book begins a sweeping epic that you never want to see come to an end.  My favorite character is Tanis, who is pulled in two different directions all the time because of his half-elven heritage.  The characters in this book are well written, and there is always a sense that the story is going somewhere.  The story is easier than LOTR, but the underlying thems of good and evil are there.  But in Dragonlance, there is a twist.  Sometimes good people do evil things, and sometimes evil people do good things.  These characters are not as black and white as Tolkien's, they seem more human.  Now that LOTR is a major movie hit and I see people reading it everywhere, this is the book that I recommend that they read next.
B00005M91K|5.0|This is an incredible, serious, and beautiful film.  The imagery is astounding and often thought-provoking.  The music is also great and matches the film very well -- if you like Peter Gabriel's \\"Passion\\" (the instrumental soundtrack to The Last Temptation of Christ), you will like the score for Baraka.<br />I disagree with the reviewer who said that Baraka is just an imitation of Koyaanisqatsi.  If you'd bother to read the credits, Ron Fricke (the creator of Baraka) was also responsible for ALL of the filming for the -qatsi trilogy (which includes Koyaanisqatsi).  Baraka is a different kind of movie, with a different, more subtly communicated message.<br />Baraka was shot in the (very expensive) 70mm format, which yields a very high quality picture, especially when transferred to DVD.  Ron Fricke is a master of the 70mm format, and he actually designed many of the camera rigs used in Baraka (including the very high quality time lapse footage).  Give Fricke some credit for having learned something in the almost 10 years since Koyaanisqatsi was filmed.<br />If you are expecting vapid, New Age eye candy, this is not the movie for you.  If you want a beautiful film that will change you, a film that you can watch again every 6 months without getting tired of it, then buy this DVD.  I have the original DVD (very hapy with it), so I can't say whether the film transfer quality in the Collector's Edition is on par.  Maybe one of these days I'll buy the Collector's Edition and see which one I like best.
B000067CPX|4.0|First lets get the bad points out of the way. As always, the lyrics aren't exactly poetic, and sometimes lack a little depth. There are also a few songs that really shouldn't be there, such as 'Can't Stop' (lightweight funk, a pale shadow on anything from Blood Sugar Sex Magik) and 'Minor Thing', which is just filler, to be honest. And, most importantly, this album doesn't rock! Anyone expecting another 'Give it Away' will be disappointed...<br />Anyway...enough complaining. Some of the melodies on this record are absolutely gorgeous. Comparing the chorus of 'Tear' to the Beatles or the Beach Boys would not be overdoing it. And John Frusciante's harmonising is glorious throughout, as are his consistently excellent riffs. Flea is, as always, fantastic, working with the songs and adding to them, but never overshadowing the melody. Also, Anthony Kiedis is really becoming a fine singer.<br />Highlights include Dosed (again, amazing chorus), Warm Tape and Venice Queen, a great song to end an album with. <BR>I'll get murdered for this, but yes, it's a whole lot better than<BR>Californication. The songs are better, and delivered with intelligence and care. Buy this record!
B00004S876|5.0|I still remember how excited I was listening to &quot;rosanna&quot;, &quot;africa&quot; and &quot;make believe&quot; 15 years ago. Toto was one of the legend pop-rock during eighties. The excitement comes again, specially when you're listening in SACD format. I never thought the beat, distortion sound of steve lukather's guitar is so alive. I don't know if it's because of Toto or the SACD sound quality. But all i know.. both combination are so great.. I have also DVD-Audio, but SACD sounds better. Thanks' to SACD technology..
B000003S09|5.0|i admit it, i'm a metal fan. this album converted me to a genre that i would have previously called &quot;old and soft&quot;.
B00006AW2J|5.0|The Rolling Stones rerealeasing their album \\"Beggars Banquet\\" . You could tell the major differences between the 1986 release and the 2002 release. Just by listening to the first song says it all. \\"Sympathy For The Devil\\". Incredible from 1 to 10.
B00006JDS4|4.0|If you are interested in losing \\"sanity points\\", then you should own or rent this movie.  I am a horror movie buff and this movie disturbed me.  ... this movie is, in my mind, THE most disquieting movie I have ever seen.  If you are interested in seeing manipulation of a \\"slow\\" person, rape of a beautiful woman, and the revenge of the aforementioned beautiful woman than this is your film.  Evil, but a glorious example of true revenge.  An \\"eye for and eye, etc\\" is portrayed in its most graphic sense in this film.
B00006RU5B|5.0|From this first effort, I must say that Audioslave is right up there, if not more enjoyable than Rage Against The Machine. Soundgarden I'm not so sure about. Regardless, this CD is awesome from top to bottom, with very few weak moments, and no bad songs. The biggest different between this and Rage is the range of music. Songs like &quot;I Am The Highway&quot; and &quot;Like A Stone&quot; are completely different from anything Rage ever did, and stuff that a lot of people never thought they would hear from the band that was Rage Against The Machine. Basically, this is usually powerful, sometimes moving, but always fun and enjoyable music for any kind of rock fan.
B000002NAK|5.0|this was a great buy, i was very pleased and madonna was great!
0553801511|5.0|I've been disappointed with a lot of eagerly awaited novels lately, authors and series I've always enjoyed suddenly have seemed padded and slow ( Jordan, Cherryh, etc)<BR>  I'm not disappointed here but maybe slightly wistful for the furious and frantic pace of her earlier books. Ms. Hobb normally builds up a trilogy of seemingly intactable and heartrending problems that are only resolved in the last third of the last part of a trilogy, normally in a fairly bittersweet fashion.<BR>  This isn't the case here, for instance a plotline is wether Fitz's adopted son will lose his apprenticeship. Beautifully written and observed but not saving the world stuff.<BR>  I wonder if this will conclude in three novels. For Ms Hobb to conclude this in a single book she will have to seriously accelerate the pace.<BR>  As usual the writing is of the finest quality, though as others have said start with the Assasin books and Liveships before you read this.<BR>   If you are a Hobb fan you should love this but I wonder if I'm alone in feeling that this was a trifle slow.
B000051Y0G|5.0|I distinctly remember, at the tender age of 12, receiving as a gift the vinyl version of She's So Unusual in 1984. Cyndi Lauper was all the rage then; her garish, multicoloured costumes in her frequently aired videos made her one of the more popular female artists in 1984 (possible even more popular than Madonna in that year). Many years after last listening to that vinyl record, I became reaquainted with She's So Unusual on this CD. The music is as dynamic and fresh today as it was back in 1984. I'm sure most people are familiar with the gimicky Girls Just Want to Have Fun, but the rest of the tracks are just as wonderful in their own way. From the beautifully sad ballad Time After Time to the bouncy She Bop, this album is a wonderful showcase for Cyndi Lauper (who unfortunately has never been able to duplicate this first success), and for 80's pop in general. Also included are live versions of Money Changes Everything, She Bop and All Through The Night - excellent additions for the serious fan.<br />Buy it...and step back in time to a wonderful era in music....
0684833395|5.0|Several reviews on this page, even the ones that label this masterpiece as a 5-star novel, fail to accurately grasp the book's significance on a moralistic level.  True, it can be said that it is an anti-war statement, but that is a shallow interpretation at best.  It questions the establishment of course, but in a sense so do all novels.  Its comedy is tremendous, but again, Catch-22 goes far deeper.<br />Catch-22 is perhaps the greatest novel of our time because it explores humanity from a perspective and depth of insight never before seen.  The significance of man in the modern world, the ironic yet inexplicably logical meanderings of man's mind, the wittiness, insecurity, hope, despair, failure, and, above all, the ultimate triumph that humanity possesses is utterly represented.<br />This novel has never failed to make me laugh, cry, despair, and ultimately to appreciate life.  Humanity is something to cherish, and Heller's Yossarian is the tangible embodiment of that ideal.
6305364613|5.0|the first time i saw this movie i hated it, i didnt understand what they were saying or what the heck was going on. But then we read the play in english, and i saw the movie again and i loved it! i think the thing about this movie is if you understand what they are saying. Its an awesome movie and i really like that they kept most of the orignal lines, and how they speek in old english. Before you buy or even watch this movie, i think you should read the play, just so you get alittle back ground on it and you know what they are talking about.
0316666343|4.0|This book was well written and very imaginative. I really enjoyed this page turner. It is a tragic story about a little girl that was brutally murdered by her neighbor. The story unfolds as Susie watches life continue without her, and her murder being investigated from heaven. Although sad, I really thought this book was worth reading and highly recommend it.
0312305060|5.0|Woven together with a master's hand, this is the story of three women in three different time periods.  One of them is the legendary Virginia Woolf, whose writing style and introspection sets the mood. We learn at the beginning that she takes her own life it 1941, but her story takes place in 1923 as she begins to write \\"Mrs. Dalloway\\".  The second story is set in the present and features the very modern middle-aged Clarissa Vaughn, who lives in my own familiar neighborhood in New York City. And then there is Laura Brown, living in a California suburb with her husband and young son in 1949.  These women have both nothing and everything in common, and, as they go about their lives on one particular June day with the hours stretching in front of them, a mood is created that sets the stage for the very satisfactory surprise ending.<br />The book is a mere 228 pages, and yet I had to read it slowly, putting it down every now and then and letting the images wash over me.  The author's words became the echoing chime of a bell, stirring my own memories and introducing a new perspective.  When a book can do all that it transcends being just a good story.  It is a work of art.  It's a troubling book, and not pleasant to read.  It deals with life and death and the hours of our lives.  And it sheds light upon it all.  Highly recommended.
B000002H2H|5.0|Do you remember when Metallica used to rock? I mean, they still rock(well, sort of), but do you remember when they used to ROCK? If you don't, I suggest you get Ride The Lightning ,not now, but right now! If you aren't convinced, check out this imaginary conversation between me and a potential customer:<br />hiphopforlife(ME): Welcome to my review of Metallica's second album, Ride The Lightning. before I start, let me give you some background on the band......<BR>Average Joe:Whoa, hold on. If your name is hiphopforlife, what are you doing reviewing a Metallica album?<BR>hiphopforlife: Be patient, homeboy. Yes I am black and the biggest lover of hip hop alive, but I am no joke as far as hard rock and metal go, since my taste ranges from Tool(LOVE EM!), Dream Theater(very underrated),Creed(very overrated),Limp Bizkit, Testament,Nirvana,Pantera,Slayer, Korn and Metallica;my first album was And Justice For All ten years ago<BR>(anotheralbum you should pick up). I am more than qualified to<br />review this album. Now on to buisness. Ride The Lightning is the second album from the artists formerly known as Metallica. While their first album, Kill 'Em All, was raw and off the wall as you can get, the guys calmed down(somewhat calmed down) and created one of the most brilliant and inventive rock albums ever; and the scary part is that the album after this one, Master Of Puppets(a legend in it's own time) is BETTER! It starts off with Fight Fire With Fire, arguably Metallica's fastest song. Ride The Lightning is up next, which brilliantly looks into the final thoughts of a man about to meet his end in an elecrtic chair. For Whom The Bell Tools relaxes on the speed, but cranks up the heaviness with a great foundation riff from the late great bass player Cliff Burton. Fade to Black is next, which is Metallica's attempt and sucess at a \\"power ballad\\"...<BR>Average Joe:Hold on ,hiphop;this has a ballad? Don't tell me that Metallica's gone Barbra Striesand or worse,Bon Jovi on us?<BR>hiphopforlife:To quote one of my rap idols, Ice Cube, KILL THAT NOISE! They have not wimped out by any means(the wimping out will be in 7 years).This is the second best metal ballad of all time(Sanitarium on Master Of Puppets is of course, number one. It is excellently written and sung by James Hetfield(the greatest metal vocalist of all time; sorry Ozzy).Trapped Under Ice and Escape are next; and to be honest, these two songs are just okay, in my opinion,which is why most people rank Master Of Puppets higher than Ride The Lightning; they aren't horrible, just okay. But the pace definitely picks up with the next two songs; DO NOT SKIP THEM! Creeping Death expounds on James' Christian scientist upbringing with a story on how Moses frees the Isrealites; it has a great middle part which makes the whole song worthwhile. Now it all comes down to the final song; the Call OF Ktulu, a superbly constructed instrumental which showcases all four members of the band's talents, especially the aforementioned Cliff Burton, who wraps up his title of the greatest bass player of all time.  That's Ride The Lightning, one of the most influential records from metal's most influential band. I would advise you to pick this up YESTERDAY, if not sooner.<BR>Average Joe: Thanks hiphop; you sold me. You are the greatest reviewer ever.<br />And you, dear reader, will be sold as well on the past greatness of the band once known as Metallica. Get Ride The Lightning, as well as their whole 80's catalog(and the Black album ,if you must).
B0000640SA|3.0|The designers of this DVD would have done well to read guidelines on human interface design. It's nigh impossible to figure out how to find all of the advertised extras because they're buried all over the place in the mock mental exam they put in in place of a menu. It's like navigating a twisted maze. This is really not the way to design these things.<br />(The movie, on the other hand, is brilliant, and many more things have been said about it than I could say.)

I wish people could see that jeremy stands for all the downtrodden and misunderstood people of the world. People should watch and understand that the way Jeremy was treated is the way African Americans are treated, Indians are treated, women, Jews, homosexuals, mentally impaired persons, old people, and anyone else society perceives as being different than they believe to be normal.<BR>When I saw this movie for the first time I remember thinking that the author was a genius and because I like to write also I wished I could write something so insiteful, powerful and moving as he had. This is truely the greatest movie ever!
B000002J1O|3.0|I'm a progressive rock fan who loves Yes, King Crimson, ELP, UK, the Nice, Rush, etc, to name a few. After years of hearing how great early Genesis is, I settled on this album as a place to start. While the playing of Steve Hackett and Tony Banks is really great when no one is singing, overall the songs are not. Specifically, the songs are pretty standard Genesis pop tunes, with some nice instrumental interludes. In later years they lost the interludes. To be honest, I find Duke and Abacab more listenable than this. I can't really include these guys as progressive rock a la the aforementioned bands just because they have some pretentions towards swords and sorcery type imagery. Oh well, maybe I can edit it down for some of the burning guitar solos and throw out the rest.

B00005JLSC|5.0|WHOA! What an amazing experience! Can anyone spell Oscar? Chicago is an incredible movie. It certainly was way more than I expected... this film is musical-lover's heaven. Even if you're not the biggest fan of musicals, you should still give this film a try- it has action, drama, and even a bit of comedy. The audience seemed to love every moment of it, clapping and laughing during several parts. No wonder why- this film is clever and powerful and beautifully done. The power of Chicago translated beautifully from the theatre to the Silver Screen. At several points in the movie I felt as though I was sitting in the front row of a theatre watching the actors on stage. The visuals and cinematography was incredible, and each musical number smoothly blending with the story. I was completely blown away by the cast, especially Catherine Zeta Jones and Richard Gere. They were absolutely incredible and such a pleasure to watch on screen. Catherine totally has that whole theatre, dramatic acting quality about her and I hope to see her in more powerful roles and singing and dancing herself away in future films. She was definitely the brightest talent in this film, and though she was one of the major roles it was still too bad that she didn't have more screen time. Renee Zellweiger wasn't bad. She's not really my favourite actress but I definitely can't say anything bad about her in this film. She fit her role nicely, and though she doesn't have nearly as powerful of a voice as Catherine nor does she seem quite as comfortable dancing on stage, she was still rather impressive. I have to also note that Queen Latifah was fantastic! She managed to make her character seem funny, loveable, selfish, and rotten all at the same time. She also proved herself quite well during her musical number. Overall, this film is absolutely amazing. I imagine it will be a major Oscar contender. Don't miss out... go see it! A definite 5 stars.

6305350205|5.0|Like I said I hate to tell you but I happen to like Star Trek alot, I've been a long time trekie, I LOVE ALL THE TREK MOVIES, and really love this one. Yes I think the effects could be better, but Star Trek is more then effects,its the friendship between Kirk, McCoy and Spock that makes this one great. Over all its not as good as ST6 but still one of the best(just think of ST:TMP!)The thing I like about this one is you get to see Spock as he was in ST1 and ST2, not the &quot;teen&quot; in ST3 or the stick in the mud Spock in ST4(had no life at all!). And I like the klingons, I like there culture, there always good(unlike some enemies like the Sona). If you read reveiws you can tell these people aren't trek Fans, there complete fools and don't know what there missing out on. Trust me, if your a trekie you will like it.<br />PS can't wait for the directers cut! if it comes out!
B00005JKWJ|4.0|If Guillermo del Toro set out to translate the language of comics to the silver screen, than he more than achieved his goal with the visually astounding Blade II. With the exception of the two returning characters of Whistler and Blade, this 'sequel' couldn't be more removed from the original if it tried. From atmosphere and colour coded lighting to whip crack pace and even more gore, Blade II is relentless in it's attempt to leave you gasping by the time the blood drenched credits roll. Foregoing any real semblance of plot (that would only slow things down after all), the film tends to feel like one long fight scene but it's all executed so impressively that the final impression left is one not unlike riding a rollercoaster. Not a bad thing and an even better thing if that's what the director set out to do. Guillermo himself is unapologetic in his honesty that he was simply intended to fashion a 'kick ...' movie that while different from Stephen Norrington's original, retains the similar style and wit that made the first so special. Acting wise, Blade is a role Wesley Snipes could probably play in his sleep so while he is predictably fantastic in bringing the character to believable life, all eyes settle on newcomer Luke Goss (he of Bros fame) and he doesn't dissapoint as the ruthless (and perhaps somewhat tragic) reaper Gerrad Nomak. From his appearance onscreen, Goss gives a captivating performance, somehow even investing a real humanity in a character that is more animalistic than human and that is testament to Goss' talents. Smartly avoiding overkill in the make up department, it's Goss' physical presence that is the most unsettling aspect of the villian. With two such formidable actors grounding the insanity that ensures in it's running run, the film is left to throw body parts up at the screen haphazardly. That it is crafted all so professionally allows you to simply be whisked away for the horrific ride. While not as acomplished as the first, Blade II remains startling good viewing. All action genres are pandered to, the horror fans get what they are after and when all is said and done, some might find themselves surprised how addictive the film continues to be, requesting if not demanding repeated viewings. A great horror and action film that deserves more of an accolade than simply 'sequel' and more a title in it's own right.
B00005JLF5|5.0|If there's anything I like more than tuna, it's Star Trek and Star Wars. Both have revolutionary accolades to their credit and rightly so. But since this is supposed to be a review for Star Trek and DS9 at that, I'll come to the point.<br />The original series back in the 60s sowed the seeds of interstellar civilization and space travel. TNG was that same theme carried fwd two decades later, but with more Victorian elegance as I like to think of it (for some odd reason). Maybe not the most apt analogy, but I think you get the idea. <br />DS9 was an interesting and pleasant deviation from the norm set by the previous two series. The prior two series centered around the universe. Whereas the universe centered around DS9, a deep space outpost recieved into the folds of the Federation for political purposes. DS9 is the only series to date from among the 5 aired since the 60s that has a single, cohesive, end-to-end story and plot. All the others, no matter how you slice them, revolve around starships exploring the universe, always the Enterprise sans Voyager. There might have been some connection between certain episodes and characters, but none of them had a single storyline across the series.<br />And this was where DS9 stood out. It was the only series that had a definite conclusion when the first episode aired. Only the details were worked out as the seasons and episodes passed. This is also probably in my mind the single main reason why DS9 has the most \\"extreme\\" followers within the Star Trek genre -- those who like it seem to love it, and those who don't tend to think it was the most worthless of all the series created. The key is you have to follow through (nearly) all the episodes and seasons (and in sequence) to understand how the story unfolds to savor it properly, else you're just wasting your time. You cannot watch a few episodes here and there, like you do in TNG or Voyager, and still enjoy it. I did the same thing at first and realized the error of my wayssoon enough, after an humble sermon from an appalled devotee of the series.<br />Once you bear this fundamental principle in mind, I think many of you will enjoy watching it more. It's a different kind of Star Trek that has its own charm. It is more deeply concerned with the development of civilizations and wars and politics and ethics rather than space adventures and explorations on distant \\"M\\" class planets. (Kindly of looks like earth going through its own evolution at times, actually!)<br />Just to whet your curiosity (for those who are unfamiliar with the series, that is), the story revolves around a deep space outpost called Deep Space Nine, which has been taken up by the Federation to help rehabilitate the planet Bjor, which had been mired in a long freedom struggle from the Cardassians and has finally received its freedom. The spacestation was constructed by the Cardassians and has been taken over by the Federation when the series opens. In the first episode, a most stunning revelation occurs to all that the space station is also located at the edge of a wormhole that leads to the other side of the galaxy to the gamma quadrant...and this wormhole is not a natural occurence, it was made by someone or something. In the course of finding out more, a race called the Dominion find their way back here with some very unfriendly plans. The series has some spectacular space battles down the road. <br />That's all I'm telling you...if this interests you, buy the series to find out the rest, else go back to looking for distant \\"M\\" class planets...
B000002J1U|4.0|The title of my review is usually the response when someone hears most of the songs on this album. It was mine. Yet throughout the years I've come to appreciate this album and Led Zep as a band because of it.  Gen X'ers like myself came to know Zep through FM rock radio's incessant playing of such Hard Rock classics like &quot;Dazed&quot;, &quot;Heartbreaker&quot;, &quot;Black Dog&quot;&quot;Stairway&quot; and such. Consequently, a gem like this album fell through the cracks. What this album shows is that Zep was first and foremost a band who played for the art of the song. Behind Jimmy Page's massed Marshall amplified guitar armies of sound, Robert Plant's vocal gymnastics and Bonzo's frieght train drumming was a group of four musicians that liked making music, creating and sustaining a mood.  Here, Zep just makes an album of music for thier own enjoyment and invite you to listen in. First up, is &quot;the Immigrant Song&quot;. Zep departs from blues based hrd rock and create a soundscape for Robert Plant's tale of Viking warriors on the high seas plundering distant lands.With its push pull riff and the cresting and swelling chord changes,the music paints a perfect picture of Vikings rowing thier ships on the stormy seas. Zep follows this with &quot;Friends&quot;. Jimmy Page weaves a new song from a riff borrowed from the intro of Crosby, Stills and Nash's &quot;Carry On&quot;. Page reshapes the borrowed riff with a droning guitar tuning while Jones adds colorful orchestral sections which sound like equal parts Ravi Shankar and the 2001 sountrack. This all provides the perfect backdrop for Plant's tale of being lost in a black night looking for friends he once knew. A total contrast to Crosby, Stills and Nash happily singing about &quot;love is coming&quot; in Carry On. Hey, Zep might of borrowed but they at least did something of thier own with it. This aspect shows up on the next 3 songs as Zep turns to the blues again in one form or another. Page returns to theblues slide guitar tradition and whips up a churning rocker in the process on &quot;Celebration Day.&quot; Next comes the album's tour de force,&quot;Since I've Been Loving You.&quot; Like what Eric Clapton did on &quot;Layla&quot;, Zep evoke the same emotional intensity of thier blues inspirations but without directly copying thier styles.  It moves much like Janis Joplin's recording of Gershwin's &quot;Summertime&quot; in mood, but Zep were just much better musicians than Joplin's band and they draw much more drama and nuance out of the blues. Side one wraps up with a rocker &quot;Out on the Tiles&quot;. Page and Jones play a  blues based riff that winds like a tricky coutry lane with that unexpected hairpin turn, while Plant sings about the simple pleasures of him and his special someone getting lost on country road one afternoon and how sometimes that is all you need. Things take a turn on Side 2. Zep blends thier love of British folk music and American blues together on thier version of &quot;Gallows Pole&quot;. A song which originally came over from the British Isles during the settlement of America,  was recorded by bluesman Leadbelly in the 40's and became popular on the 60's folk circuit. Plant dispenses with singing it like the coffeehouse folk singers did and instead testifies and shouts like delta bluesman while Page and Jones add in mandolins,banjo, acoustic guitars and an eletric guitar made to sound like a fiddle over Bonzo's galloping cadence.Is it blues or folk music? Who cares? Zep wasn't about displaying the music of the past faithfully to the last minute detail like a museum curator but, about learning from and contributing something of thier own to it. Zep then draws together English folk balladry and country music together on &quot;Tangerine.&quot; A bittersweet ballad of unrequited love with an almost omnious sounding guitar solo that falls in the middle of the song that sounds straight out of the hazy days of San Francisco psychedelic rock.Ifsome people dismiss Zep as a heavy metal band well show me where Deep Purple, Van Halen or Metallica do anything like this. Things mellow out further with a country folk ballad called &quot;That's the Way&quot;. If you like songs like &quot;Going to California&quot; or the &quot;Rain Song&quot; then this one will go over quite well. For a Zep album that Page eschews guitar solos on, he shows some flatpicking chops on &quot;Bron-Yr-Aur Stomp&quot; while Jones and Bonzo play upright bass and spoons. Finally comes the only weak track on the album &quot;Hats off to Roy Harper&quot;.<BR>Page and Plant messing around trying to sound like some scratchy old blues record from the 30's. I skip that one. Overall, the cohesiveness of this album may not be as strong as what showed up on II, IV and Physical Graffiti but the creativity and innovation shown should prompt Zep fans to take another look at this one. Headbangers might get bored with it but music lovers looking for a suprise might like this one.
B00005221L|5.0|Arnold was a burgeoning action star in the 80's, and the vicious, relentless \\"Predator\\" is one of his best.  The film has a dual plot:  Arnold is called to a central american country with his cohorts to recapture what they think is kidnapped dignitary, and also face off with a predatory (go figure) alein out for a little hunting.  They soon find themselves out gunned and out witted by the alein who can make itself invisible and also packs a laser gun that can blast a hole a diameter of a foot in your chest.  The climax is Arnold finds himself pitted against the unmasked alein, no longer invisible but terrifyingly strong.<br />The special and visual effects still look stunning today.  From the infared eyesight of the alein to his invisibility technology, it stills looks like computers today pulled off the shots.  Then lets not forget the action sequences, tightly directed by John Mctierien of \\"Die Hard\\" fame.  They're bloody but still some of the best I have ever seen.  Arnold and the gang are very much in their comfort zones with Mctierien behind the camera.  And to offset the blood and guts, there is some comic relief, mostly provided by Jesse Ventura.  I still get a kick out of the helicopter scene when they first go in to the jungle.<br />All in all, this an action movie that  has been able to survive the 80's with credibility, primarily because of the director.  The predator itself is a sight to behold, ugly as hell but still able to become a fixture of popular cultire, especially around Halloween.  If your in the mood for specatular action, stunning visuals and one hell of a villian, \\"Predator\\" should still near the top of your list.
B000066NW0|5.0|this is a great albume but a lot of the punks were expecting something way diffrent but i dont care ima person that has alwayz listened to hard rock all my life but this album kicks.... it has all kinds of twist's and turns along the way of this cd!it goes from rock to mellow to punk to soflt its just a great cd it keeps you gessing.great acoustics not to mention she is fine as hell! this cd is a must for anyone who loves to just mellow out and as the album is tittled let go
B00005V3Z4|5.0|Ok, I was wasting time in a chat room. Suddenly someone asked if anyone had seen this movie, \\"Donnie Darko.\\" Several others began to speak, but only vaguely. However, I was drawn, without knowing ANY specifics beyond the title and the mood of the movie. <BR>I found it that evening on a pay channel (does that seem a bit like destiny, my path in life?); and I watched, mouth agape, as the scenes unfolded in an intricate web of events all centering around the main character, Donnie, who was saved from death by his new imaginary friend, Frank: a six-foot tall bizarre-looking rabbit.<BR>Frank instructs Donnie to do things, things that disrupt and tear at the lives of the people of his town and school. And as I was appalled by Donnie's obedience, I couldn't help but to understand how we all feel led at times, as if it were out of our control.<BR>The movie is a study in irony at every turn; and as the story comes full circle, you see that redemption is the ultimate irony here. And Donnie Darko willingly and joyously bought it for everyone.<BR>Few movies have left me quiet for so long, alone with my thoughts of life/death, action/consequence... Now \\"Donnie Darko.\\"
0060536969|4.0|Well, Michael Crichton makes another interesting technical story that only seems plausible because of his exausting explanations that seem to appear in every chapter.  It always seems his explanations are meant to convince himself as well as the audience.  Like Andromeda Strain, Jurassic Park, Sphere and most Crichton works, he likes to deal with small group dynamics and avoids the global effects of the crisis at hand.  Still, it made for an interesting 13 hours.  I &quot;read&quot; the audio version, which infuses a little of the reader's acting into the read, but it seems the only way I can read these days.
B00005N5S5|5.0|The \\"Terminator\\" made Arnold a superstar, James Cameron a hot product and a franchise going ito its third movie.  The visuals and special effects are a little crude, but Cameron injects a kinetic style that makes up for it.  The opening scene with the machines advancing on the humans still can send shivers down your spine.  The plot very complicated, brimming with mythic undertones and an epic sweep, but a Terminator, an advanced machine that is programmed to kill humans, is sent back in time to kill the mother of John Connor, the savior of mankind against the onslaught of the machines.  But a human soldier named Resse is sent back also to protect Sarah, the mother, tell her of the future and destroy the terminator.  Their cat and mouse chase is gripping, and Arnold is chillingly cold as the machine.  We also have superb action scenes, such as a car chase through a tunnel, the Terminator rampaging through a police station, and especially Resse's flashbacks to the future. <br />In many ways, the coldness of the \\"Terminator\\" is more haunting than the effects happy sequel (though they use them to optimum effect).  Also, Linda Hamilton is effective as Sarah, a usually timid LA girl who learns of her future, iconic like status.  The main flaw with the movie is the sometimes too profane dialouge.  The interplay in some scenes does not need a ...  every other line.  Though Arnold telling the motel manager .... is utterly hysterical.  <br />This is one of the best action movies period.  The story is mythic, the acting well done and the direction top notch.  Even 20 years after its inception, this is still one of the premier action movies around.  Trat yourself to it.
B00003CXI1|1.0|Truly a bad movie, made all the more disappointing for the clunky, unimaginative way it tackles its subject: one of the most delightful and imaginative creations to come around in a long time.  The sets uniformly resemble prebuilt facades at Disney World, and the pacing and direction are plodding and second-rate.  Nowhere in this movie do you find yourself lifted out of your seat and truly engaged; one is always aware that they are watching the ponderous and effortful attempt to recreate the book.  The movie has no magic of its own.  One example is the wonderful secene from the book where the Sorting hat picks Harry for Gryffindor; in the book this scene is enthralling; in the movie, it has no zing.  The spectacle of the hat with an animated mouth is silly, and actually detracts from the notion that the battered old hat has hidden, mystical powers which Harry can only sense (and who's voice he can only hear) when he slips it on and is plunged into the inner dark world of the Hat.  (The hat in the book has no mouth.)  There were a million different interesting and creative ways of depicting this scene cinematically and Mr. Columbus, the director, has exhibited the anti-genius to find one of the more drab approaches to it.  (if only Terry Gilliam had been picked to direct the movie; he was in the running; but then the film might not yet be finished . . . .) The kids' acting is good, particularly those of the kids playing Ron and Hermione, although there are times when you're only too aware of the mimitations of the young cast.  The adults are fine, with the best performances coming from Alan Rickman and Robbie Coltrane as Professor Snape and Hagrid, respectively, but they're not around enough.  <br />My 7 year old son, who loved the books and claimed to LOVE the movie, was squiriming in his seat by the end of this overly-long movie; and now that we own it, he never watches it at all.<br />Read the book instead.
B00002Z88D|2.0|I first started listening to Metallica because I thought they they sounded very symphonic in their arrangements, so I thought this would be fantastic.  Boy was I disappointed.  Besides the fact that the early Metallica recordings (peaking with the mind-blowing And Justice For All) WERE arranged symphonically for the Symphony of Metallica.  The guitars use chorus and sustainer effects to give them the admirable qualities of a symphony orchestra, with the advantage that they are heavier, faster, more powerful, and clearer, which enabled them to musically go places symphonies had never gone before.  Now for this album's faults: First of all, look at their set list, it doesn't fit.  Many of those songs just weren't arranged symphonically, here's my dream set list <br />the ecstasy of gold<BR>the call of ktulu<BR>master of puppets<BR>welcome home (sanitarium)<BR>the thing that should not be<BR>disposable heroes<BR>blackened<BR>harvester of sorrow<BR>...and justice for all<BR>to live is to die<BR>damage inc.<br />nothing else matters<BR>for whom the bell tolls<BR>fade to black<BR>through the never<BR>one<BR>battery<BR>unforgiven<BR>trapped under ice<BR>creeping death<BR>unforgiven 2<br />At least these songs were written and arranged to played with symphonic granduer, unlike \\"almost\\" everything of their's that I've heard starting on the 'Black' album. Not to say that I don't like it, but it's completely different both stylisticly and theoretically. The reason most veteran Met fans don't like it is because they've heard these ideas done before, only better. The reason newer Met fans like it is because they've probably never heard the concept before. My advice: buy ...And Justice For All and pretend it's orchestra sounds.  It has better, cleaner arrangments, better songs, better solos, better musicianship, room for the songs to \\"breathe\\", (as was once said in a movie (about Mozart) \\"too many notes\\") better vocals, no screaming crowd, no chugga-chugga garbage, just badass melody-based ripping brutal [explicit]MeTaL \--/ METAL MILITIA FOREVER \--/ <br />
B000002JKA|5.0|In 1994, Dream Theater released their heaviest album to date, \\"Awake\\".  It's also possibly their best.  Well, either way, this album is amazing, and if you're a fan of Dream Theater it's obviously a must.  <br />The music is generally heavier and darker than \\"Images &amp; Words\\".  John Petrucci used a 7 string guitar for several songs on this album, and he does plenty of heavy riffing.  His solos are also awesome.  He can shred amazingly well, but in my opinion, he's also very lyrical and emotional.  His solo on \\"Voices\\" is just dripping with emotion.  Anyway, as I said, some songs are very heavy, especially \\"Lie\\".  I swear that riff in the beginning could have been played by Zakk Wylde!  <br />The highlights for me are \\"6:00\\", which is a DT classic, with it's awesome keyboard harmonies and heavy riffing, the trilogy, \\"A Mind Beside Itself\\", which I will talk about in a minute, the epic \\"Scarred\\" and \\"Space Dye Vest\\", Kevin Moore's dark, moody piano piece.  The trilogy, \\"A Mind Beside Itself\\" consists of three sections: \\"Erotomania\\", an instrumental that has themes that come later and some insane technical playing by the band, \\"Voices\\", which has possibly my favorite John Petrucci solo (it's ultra-emotional and simply incredible) and \\"The Silent Man\\", the acoustic guitar ballad, which is quite pretty.  I have to say though, I like the version of \\"The Silent Man\\" better on \\"Live Scenes...\\" where they kick it up and play it with the whole band.  This one is still good though.  \\"Scarred\\" is the longest song on the album at 11 minutes, but it doesn't seem long.  John's lyrics are really great.  \\"Space Dye Vest\\" is maybe my favorite on here.  It's a dark piano driven song, with lyrics written by Kevin Moore.  I really like his lyrics, and this song is certainly no exception.  I can't really explain how much I like this song.  When the guitar comes in to do the main melody at the end...Wow...<br />Anyways, I can't really say much about this album because I'm not terriblygood at writing reviews(I like to write them, but I always have trouble), but I can say if you like Dream Theater and you don't have this album, you must buy it.  If you like metal, there's a good chance you'll find this interesting, but it's much more progressive than bands like Metallica.  If you want to try something new, pick this up.  Also, check out \\"Images &amp; Words\\" which I like a little better than this one.
B00005YXZH|5.0|Yankee Hotel Foxtrot is the first Wilco album I've heard and I love it!  This CD is definitely one of my top 5 of 2002.  The songs are catchy without being dumb.  The lyrics are very thought provoking.  The first time I heard the CD I was shocked.  It wasn't at all what I was expecting.  While it is on the mellow side, Yankee Hotel Foxtrot doesn't become boring.  <br />Before I listened to this CD, I suspected the songs would be quiet, folky and dull.  While they are quiet and folky at times, they are also very modern.  The songs are certainly never dull.  These are excellent pop songs.  No record collection is complete without the album!
0140131558|5.0|This is one of the strangest books, actually three short novellas, that I've ever read. It's almost like a university-sponsored experiment in avante garde literature...no traditional beginning-middle-end structure, no formulaic plotline, no standard 'protagonist' and 'antagonist' characters, odd, stilted dialog, difficult to figure allegory, etc...all of the rules are broken here. It communicates on a bizarre, almost visceral level that is hard to describe, almost as if Auster creates a seperate reality that makes sense as you're reading it and later confuses the hell out of you when you stop and think about it. I couldn't really say that I &quot;enjoyed&quot; this book, honestly it kind of gave me 'the willies', but I keep a copy in my collection because it is just so odd, so amazingly unique and quite probably the work of a bona-fide genius. I have never read anything quite like this.
B00005QG9J|1.0|This cd does not even compare to any of the first three Incubus albums.  It all started going down hill with \\"Make Yourself\\".  An apt title to preceed this album since \\"Morning View\\" is exactly like every other main stream rock album out there.  Brandon used to have so much lyrical talent.  Now all he does is sing \\"I wish you were here\\" over and over in the choruses. Or \\"good bye nice to know you\\".  I guess it has a lot to do with doing too much drugs.  But if I were you I would purchase an older Incubus cd, where the music is structured and the lyrics were actually thought out before they were recorded.  If I could have given this cd half a star I would have.  [...]
B000002HPT|5.0|This album has gotten a lot of negative response because, apparently, it's their \\"sellout\\" album.  Well, don't take that too seriously, because aside from a few weaker songs (which are good, but not up to Dream Theater's standards), this album is friggin' amazing.  There are definitely some weaker songs though.  However, this album is still more than worth buying if you're a Dream Theater fan, because it's awesome!<br />Well, we obviously know that John Petrucci, John Myung, and Mike Portnoy are incredible musicians.  John Petrucci's guitar work here is, IMO, his most tasteful, and easily his least flashy, but possibly his best.  John Myung is a talented and humble bass player.  On \\"New Millenium\\" he uses a Chapman Stick, which shows how diverse and talented he is.  Mike's drumming definitely did not stand out here as much as previous albums, or as much as later albums, but it's still obviouse that he's an incredible drummer.  James LaBrie has an amazing voice, not much else can be said on that.  So, what about the new keyboardist, Derek Sherinian? Well, he's pretty good.  Not quite the songwriter Kevin was, and not quite the technical player Jordan is, but hey, if he was hired by Dream Theater, don't you think he must be good? Well, he is.<br />I suppose I'll start off with the better songs.  \\"New Millennium\\" is one of their best songs, IMO.  John Myung uses a Chapman Stick on this song, and if you don't know what that is, look into it, cuz they're pretty cool.  Anyway, this is a great song.  It reminds me of \\"Pull Me Under\\" or \\"6:00\\", being a perfect opener, and a Dream Theater classic.  \\"Peruvian Skies\\" is a great darker song, that builds up into some spectacular metal riffing and a great solo by John.  \\"Hollow Years\\" is an amazing ballad.  Just a beautiful song.  \\"Hell's Kitchen\\" is an instrumental, but not the same kind as \\"Ytse Jam\\" or \\"The Dance of Eternity\\".  It's not flashy and technical, it's more soft and beautiful, and John's guitar work is incredibly tasteful.  \\"Lines in the Sand\\" is an epic song, and a strong one.  Not another \\"Scarred\\", but it's very pleasing nonetheless.  \\"Take Away My Pain\\" is another ballad, and another beautiful song.  It's dedicated to John's father, who passed away.  \\"Anna Lee\\" is another ballad, which a lot of people don't like.  I think it's an excellent song.  Now here's the best part.  \\"Trial of Tears\\" is probably my favorite song on the album, and also the longest.  It starts off slow, and it builds up.  It has two incredible solos, one by John Petrucci and one by Derek Sherinian, and then it has a powerful finish.  One of their best songs ever.<br />Now the weaker songs.  Well, \\"You Not Me\\", while it isn't a terrible song, is definitely not up to DT's standards.  It has a pretty cool wah wah riff, but prog. fans will definitely be turned off by this one, especially if they don't like \\"mainstream\\" stuff.  \\"Burning My Soul\\" is almost awful.  The music is decent, but the lyrics are pretty bad.  Same with \\"Just Let Me Breath\\", although that's not nearly as bad.  The music in \\"Just Let Me Breath\\" is killer, but the lyrics have already been said before 100 times, and said better.  So, the weaker songs are ok, except for \\"Burning My Soul\\", but nothing spectacular.<br />Anyways, aside from those few bad points, this album is awesome.  Even though I don't like it as much as say, \\"Images &amp; Words\\" or \\"Awake, this album is excellent.  Highly recommended to fans of Dream Theater.
B000069HK2|5.0|Well The Used are something special. This album focuses on the bands past history and it shows, All the songs have real meanings and are performed with real meaning. 'Maybe Memories' and 'A Box Of Sharp Objects' are both similar but completely different. Both are pretty heavy and are great to listen to. 'On My Own' offers a great alternative to all the other songs as it is slow, a good to chill out to as its acoustic. If you like acoustic song, then you'll love 'On My Own'. Ive read other people's reveiws of this album and some i really cant understand, if you like this album you'll love it and if you dont then why did you buy it in the first place!!?? unless you havnt heard them before that is. These guys offer a quality performance and well worth the money. If you like Glassjaw or Thursday the chances are you'll like The Used. And id also like to add these guys sound nothing like Thursday or any other band for that matter, their totally original and are a class act.
B00006CXXU|5.0|Personally, I thought this CD was great!  It really does show  what I believe Christina Aguilera is........a girl with a beautiful voice.
B00001OH7V|4.0|I don't subscribe to the conventional wisdom regarding \\"Heroes\\", so I have taken a bit more time than usual to compose my review.<br />Apologies in advance, then, for the essay:<br />Context: It's the latter half of the seventies. Having faffed around in the Sixties producing the output one would expect of an Anthony Newley aspirant (i.e., none of any merit) David Bowie had struck gold - just - in 1972 with a second release of the second attempt on a tune he'd had knocking around since well before the moon landing in August '69. Space Oddity is a great tune, so the only surprise is that it didn't get picked up earlier.<br />From 1972 Bowie releases a succession of breathtakingly good records, numbering among them Hunky Dory (think \\"ch-ch-ch-changes\\", and then consider that this is probably the weakest track on the album. Yes, I know: it isn't weak), The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust (which melds the vastly differing styles of 1969's Dylanesque Space Oddity, 1971's hard rock effort The Man Who Sold The world, and 1972'a Hunky Dory), and then by way of post gig hangover, Aladdin Sane (Bowie's equivalent of Rattle and Hum - or \\"Ziggy goes to America\\").<br />At this point things (you know, cocaine, the success, the accountants, the management contract, the hairdo) were clearly beginning to get the better of him, and the latent paranoia in his records became startlingly overt in the next release, the Orwellian concept album Diamond Dogs (not actually as bad as it sounds!), and finally David wigged out altogether midway through the Diamond Dogs tour, quickly recorded and released a record of dreadful plastic Philly soul, Young Americans (which isn't to say it wasn't popular - it was - nor that doesn't have its dedicated adherents) and a live album of the experience (David Live) which appeared to prove quite the contrary.<br />This back-story is important because it is the context for Bowie's next three, great records, of which \\"Heroes\\" is the last.  The first and second are Station To Station and Low.<br />I should immediately own up to being a little controversial here: most Bowie-Nuts will, tell you that \\"Heroes\\" is the middle of The Great Triptych of \\"Berlin\\" collaborations with Brian Eno, which starts with Low and concludes with Lodger.<br />I think most Bowie nuts are wrong. Station To Station, whilst recorded in LA at around the time The Man Who Fell To Earth was filmed, is the first of the record where Bowie pulls everything together and jettisons entirely the excesses of the Ziggy Stardust experience: this is indeed the first part of the rehabilitation which \\"Heroes\\" completes: here, the Man has indeed fallen to earth and the decision to quit America has been made, even if the body hasn't moved. \\"The European Canon is Here\\" sings the Transylvanian sounding - and looking - Thin White Duke.<br />If Station To Station staunches the flow of paranoia and halluncination, then Low works it out of the system: if Bowie is to be believed (as often as not, he isn't) even when he moved to Berlin he was still a pretty spooked out puppy (\\"Always Crashing In The Same Car\\" is, allegedly, autobiographical) but by the end of an album half comprising taut, sparse, minimalist rock songs  and half moving but pretty maudlin instrumentals (from anyone else, you'd call that \\"self-indulgence\\"), Bowie was ready to pull out of the swan dive. Where Lodger might be  the fly-by once he'd done it, and Scary Monsters the sitting-by-the-fireside-recounting-all-his-adventures, \\"Heroes\\" prescribes the upward bending arc to the heavens.<br />Man, that sounds pretentious. But what i mean is that, for the first time in a while it's record that's not completely inward looking: Bowie notices others and they form the material for his metaphors: a performance artist who nails himself to a Volkswagen. Lovers who furtively meet by the wall. There are a couple of pretty nifty asides where Bowie assesses his position: \\"I wanted to believe me; I wanted no distractions;I wanted to be good\\" he wails in Beauty and the Beast, and in Joe the Lion he remarks, \\"You can buy God - it's Monday...\\".<br />For all this cleverness, it's an album which does take some getting used to. It doesn't have the lush production of Ziggy Stardust - even the comparatively jarring Low is an easy listen compared to Robert Fripp's punishing guitar work here - and there is half an album of pretty impenetrable instrumentals on it - again, at first listen they're harder work than the equivalents on Low, but fundamentally they reward perseverance.<br />But when Bowie does put it all together, it's just magnificent. There are two places he really does this. The first is the triumphant title track, \\"Heroes\\" itself, of which there's not much to say but listen. From the very first down-stroke, tweaks you like a photo of an old girlfriend.  The other is Sons of the Silent Age, which follows it, and in which Bowie really exercises his lungs with his patented \\"histrionic\\" singing style.<br />In summary, there are too many oddities and unexplained curios (such as the instrumental side!) on this record for it to hold up as among the greatest Bowie has done across 40 minutes, but, as the old boy himself said, \\"When it's good, it's REALLY good...\\"ions; I wanted to be good\\" he wails in Beauty and the Beast, and in Joe the Lion he remarks, \\"You can buy God - it's Monday...\\".<br />For all this cleverness, it's an album which does take some getting used to. It doesn't have the lush production of Ziggy Stardust - even the comparatively jarring Low is an easy listen compared to Robert Fripp's punishing guitar work here - and there is half an album of pretty impenetrable instrumentals on it - again, at first listen they're harder work than the equivalents on Low, but fundamentally they reward perseverance.<br />But when Bowie does put it all together, it's just magnificent. There are two places he really does this. The first is the triumphant title track, \\"Heroes\\" itself, of which there's not much to say but listen.

B00005JL78|2.0|I was disappointed by this movie. Tom Cruise and Colin Farrell were not able to do their best work here. The story at first sounded interesting. You have certain people who could see future events before they happened, these people were called precogs or precognitives. Murder was the only event they could see according to the movie. So much for robbery and kidnapping which are the most frequently committed crimes compared to murder. Well, maybe not kidnapping that's even more rare. Of course, kidnapping is an important factor in Minority Report because John Anderton (Tom Cruise) suffers with a broken heart and a broken life due to the loss of his son. His son was kidnapped about six years ago. The kidnapper was never found.<br />Precogs are useless in these types of crimes. John's wife leaves him and he lives in a technologically cold world of precrime work and loneliness. Colin Farrell plays a Dept. of Justice agent who is assigned to investigate any flaws in the system. The precogs are kept in an isolated chamber in a pool. Their brains are hardwired to a computer and their thoughts are downloaded into the computer's database for the police to use. The idea of downloading a person's thoughts is obviously not possible since we don't have software in our brains. Our brains are only hardware.<br />But there is the idea of \\"suspension of disbelief\\" when watching fictionalized stuff. The precogs of course predicted that John would commit murder and he's off on a Mission Impossible like escape. This movie is MI:3 with a more interesting premise. Of course about halfway into the movie I started feeling like a precog myself. I was able to predict down to the last twisting detail who was doing what and how it all would end. I guess I am a precognitive too...<br />Watch this movie realizing that it's MI:3 to a certain extent and that the precogs in the movie are not the only precogs that know how the movie will end. If you like Tom Cruise think about possibly watching thismovie. Otherwise read the short story.
0553108034|5.0|I consider A Clash of Kings the best novel so far in A song of Ice and Fire series. It has one of the best plots I've ever read. In the beggining, all the characters seem to be isolated and going through unrelated experiences, but Martin later brings them all together, in an explosive and compelling storyline. The battles in King's Landing and Winterfell are incredible. I could literally not put it down.<BR>       This book was almost a journey for me, I laughed, cried and was healed at the end. This is one of the BEST BOOKS I have ever read. When I was finished reading it, I was surprised that after 728 pages, I was sad to see it over. I bought the sequel the next day.

B000001C6M|3.0|Slayer's first album, 'Show No Mercy', is for all intents and purposes the spiritual twin brother of Metallica's 'Kill 'Em All'. It was one of the albums that really introduced the whole concept of \\"thrash\\" or \\"speed\\" metal, and offered up a few classics that still endure today...great songs like \\"Black Magic\\", \\"Die By the Sword\\" (remember Tom's cheesy live intro? \\"They say the pen is mightier than the sword! I say (BLEEP) the pen! 'Cause you can DIE by the sword!!!\\"), \\"Evil Has No Boundaries\\"...you get the picture.<br />But frankly, this album has another similarity to 'Kill 'Em All'...it's an album that I really never find myself having any desire to put on and listen to.  Compared to most of the band's work that followed it (including the terrifyingly brutal \\"Haunting the Chapel\\" EP that came out only a couple of months after this), 'Show No Mercy' really hasn't shown it's age well. While it possesses a sort of endearing naive charm, many of the songs seem stiff and reflective of the band's relative inexperience in writing; solos lacking any sort of firey intensity, Dave's drumming at this point being rather unremarkable. The production is a dull thud; totally lacking in any definition or bite. And the Satanic cheese factor is enough to induce constipation (Side \\"6\\" and side \\"66\\"?! Oh, brother!).<br />'Show No Mercy' is as important an album as any that exists in metal simply for it's historical value alone, but it doesn't hold a candle to what the band would later accomplish. Still, you need it for your collection.
B00005R87Q|4.0|Nothing says the Big Show like Vin Diesel blasting down the highway over a 100 mph. I enjoyed watching Vin (Dom, character he plays) race in the coolest cars you ever want to see. Dom was a fighter until the end. He got busted up but it was worth the fast pounding action and roar of the engines. I only took off one star because Paul Walker kept getting in the way.<br />Watch this movie for a speedracing rush and a quick shot of Vin on high Diesel.
B00006BTCA|5.0|I'm so glad I gave this CD a chance. While they inmediately remember me of musical landmarks as Joy Division, Talking Heads and David Bowie, the nicest thing about this New York band is that they're not a rip-off. They don't limit themselves to sound as another copy around their spectrum of influences, they just make you remember those influences but with their own twist. That means that yes, actually, you can hear them as themselves. If you wish you can call that \\"misreading\\", in the Bloomian sense of the word. And because they don't stand as a \\"three-chord-rock n'roll-saviours\\" (whatever-that-means), that makes them --paradoxically-- refreshing to the ear. And because they're refreshing to the ear, that means I can't take them off the player. If you give a chance to this CD, pay special attention to \\"Stella was a diver and she was always down\\". I'm sure you will manically put that  on 'repeat' again and again. Believe me, get this CD and like me you'll be glad that you have given this CD a chance. It's worth it. So, check this out. Enjoy.
B000002J1B|5.0|Jon Anderson's always inscrutable lyrics are at their most serviceable on this album.  There isn't too much of them; and what there is doesn't detract from the mood, which, unusually for Yes, is clearly discrenible (close to the edge of What?).  And, hey, it rocks, even if you don't find yourself humming \\"Gates\\" or \\"Sound Chaser\\" in the shower. If their overall tone inspires parody, well, that's the price of being dramatic as opposed to ironic.  You can blame them for that for all you want, and I frequently (over the years) do.  The main caveat I'd give for this is its propensity for being annoying-- but there are enough hooks to pull you over to their side with repeated listenings.  And \\"Soon\\" is one of the most heartbreakingly beautiful pieces in the checkered history of \\"progressive\\" rock.
B000009EAD|5.0|If I had to describe Iced Earth I really don't know what I could say but: awesome.  If you call yourself a fan of metal and don't own this album, there is something wrong. In this day and age of one-hit-wonder bands it is rare to find a CD that you can listen to all the way through without hearing the same sound. This CD is so great, I don't mind hearing it over and over. The Trilogy at the end is especially amazing (even more so when you see them play all 3 songs non-stop live)
B00005JL96|5.0|I absolutely loved this movie. Lilo and Stitch are so cute. Basically, once I heard Lilo use one of my favorite words abomination I fell instantly in love with this Elvis inspiring movie. <br />This is a good wholesome movie for anyone to watch. Maybe the Elvis haters should avoid this pick.
B00005MP58|5.0|Thank you A&amp;E. Thank God for Colin Firth. This adaptation to JA's Pride and Prejudice is wonderful beyond words. I was trilled with each moment. Any true romantic would like this, and even those who aren't romantic will find it very interesting. This brings that dull old book you have to read in high school to life and to see Jane Austen's wit on screen and treated in such a classic manner is priceless. This is a must have!
B000002J20|3.0|That this is a long album.  A really long album.  A TOO long album.  I'm wondering if there are very many more than the 90 or so people who gave this album five stars in this forum who actually listened to the whole thing more than a couple of times.  But don't get me wrong.  There's good stuff here.  But mostly on the first 10 or so minutes of &quot;The Revealing Science of God&quot; and almost all of &quot;Ritual&quot;.  &quot;Ritual&quot; is quite good, although you do get tired of it after a while, because, like the rest of the album, they kind of overreach.  I've never met anyone who actually listened to the other sides much, but evidently such people exist.  I personally never got through them more than once or twice.  Very boring, if not unlistenable.  The liner notes are a gas.  Hopefully they're preserved on the CD version.
B00004Z459|5.0|I got this CD about 2 years ago almost right when it came out.  I have listened to it about a million times since then, and I have NEVER been unpleased by its great mix of Rock, Rap, and Electronic music.  Never have I felt that the song has become boring because I've listened to it too many times.  If fact the more I listen the more attached I become!  Another great thing about this CD is that I can listen to it all the way through with out finding any bad songs.  The bottom line is that if you like good music get this CD, or you could continue to listen to ...  To wrap up; Linkin Park Hybrid Theory- Really Good;...
B00004T1C8|4.0|This tunnel generates one of four sounds when the train passes through or the button on the top is pressed. The sounds are well made. They include an owl sound, train and mine sounds and so forth. I think the playback volume is just right.<BR>A nice touch is the steps made on one side of the mountain as well as the small bridge on the top. These features creates a roleplay area for your child to explore with the small Brio men and women you can get in some of the other Brio sets.
B00004TDTO|5.0|\\"Jaws\\" is the best shark movie ever made and it is my absolute favorite movie of the 1970s. It is also a big hit at the box office in 1975. A police chief (Roy Scheider), a sailor (Robert Shaw), and a marine biologist (Richard Dreyfuss) ride on the boat, called the Orca, to kill the giant great white shark, that had eaten some people on the beach in Amity Island. The fact is that this movie is rated PG. It should have been rated PG-13 because of the violence in it and it is not a movie for younger kids to watch. But, it is a cinematic masterpiece. I have \\"Jaws\\" on DVD and I am happy to own it. A must-own for your DVD player.
B000002J1C|3.0|All right.  I've heard enough of the technical brilliance, the vision, the otherworldlines, the how-it-gets-you-there-ness better than Crimson or ELP or whomever, blah, blah, blah... And don't get me wrong, this music can be, well, transcendent.  That's why I bought it after hearing the live version in concert in 1976 and about 200 times subsequently on &quot;Yessongs&quot; when I was 17.  But you have to admit, that's a LOT of words, a lot of getting up and down, and, well, what about it?  I don't have a clue.  It was all so much clearer when Gerald Ford was President.
B00006RCNJ|5.0|If you're already an Andr Rieu fan then you know all of his concerts are great fun, and this one ranks with his best.  If you have not yet become a fan of his, it's time you did, and this is a good one to start with.  The concert starts out just about as any concert should.  Everyone is behaving, including the orchestra.  But gradually things become a bit -- how should I put it -- I wouldn't exactly say crazy, but I'd be getting close.  Those reserved Brits are dancing,clapping, yelling, popping balloons, and truthfully making you feel you have always had the wrong impression of them.  They are just as crazy as any other fans at a Rieu concert. By the time the fireworks go off at the end, you will be more than glad you didn't pass this one up.

B000068PQ0|2.0|I really don't understand why this album gets so much hype.  It seems like the people that rave about this album only listen to indie-rock and love what the Lips have done with this one.  Well guess what?  There are at least a hundred other people out there doing this kind of music only better.  The people that rave about this album probably have no clue because these other artists are in the \\"Techno\\" section of their favorite record store.  I'd avoid this [...].  To sum up- \\"Yoshimi\\" is boring and really cheesy at times.  There's one song where everytime the guy sings the word \\"Future\\" they make it sound like he's in a 1960's sci-fi flick.  The digital/analog effects aren't enhancing the songs, they're overdone.
0676973779|4.0|This book gets off to a really slow start, so much so that I either wanted to return it or use it as a sedative.  Then, out of nowhere..actually when Pi is in the lifeboat, the story takes off running.  Then, I had a hard time putting it down and finally understood why Martel won the awards that he did. I took back the idea that only pretentious writers won the Booker prize.
B000001EHS|3.0|I never thought I would actually buy a Def Leppard album!Def leppard has always been to me the perfect exemple of band with no talent what so ever that reaches the top for some unknow reason.Then a couple of weeks ago I heard Pour some sugar on the radio and the song wouldn't go out of my head!So I had to buy a greatest hits to check if my impressions about the band were still valid.<BR>And I have to admit that now I understand why DL made it to the top, they really have great refrains and melodies!Classic Heavy rocks or ballads, fun and straight to the point.<BR>But I still believe that the music is very basic and far from being original, the sound of the HYSTERIA period is too late 80's for me and I still think that Joe Elliot is not a great singer...fine that's all.<BR>But besides their great tunes what I really appreciate about Def Leppard is the sincerity behind the simplicity and the hard work they must have put on each album especially after Rick Allen's accident, and just for that DL deserves all gratitudes!<BR>I am not saying that VAULT will turn me into the biggest Leppard fan but it sure gives me the will to listen to more of their work.
0425152251|5.0|You can always find huge books about philosophy and after a few pages you're totally lost, and have to start over again several times. But this one is different. Jostein Gaarder has sold this book all over the world, and I can see why!!<BR>I first started to read this book when I was 15 years old, and to be honest I found it boring and gave up after a few chapters. But having read it again now, 4 years later, I have a completely different view on the book. It's not hard to read and you can easily follow young Sophie's ways of thinking. To some point her ways of thinking can be reflected in your ways of thinking. Trying to understand who you are, where you're from and other ancient philosophical questions. Seeing the different aspects of thinking makes you start to think yourself.<BR>I would recommend this to anyone older than 18. And espesially to those you want to learn something about philosophy without starting on books with a difficult language and content. And most important, all history of philosophy gathered in one place, to give you an easy overview on it. I had read this book before studying a semester of Philosophy, and it made the studies a lot easier! It's really worth to read, and you won't be disappointed.
B00005JKJA|4.0|In Mulholland drive you have a set of characters, a set of places, objects and sounds. You have what seems to be a an idea of story -Except for the man behind the wall, who is doing it all-. And then, before you can do anything about it, the story goes through a transition point after which nothing can be understood through the simplistic structure of conventional storytelling.<br />The interconnections between the caracters, their identities, objects and places, are all juxtaposed and thrown around, pieces to a puzzle that just doesn't seem to come together, but your intuition and that intuition which Lynch is a master of conveying into his ideas, suggest that all the pieces could somehow fit together... which in fact they do, in the sense of a dreamlike surrealist space, questions are not answered in a concrete, orthodox way. What happens as a reaction to this, is that one creates many questions on his own, and delves into the feeling of uncertainty with only a vague, but undeniable feeling of having been on wandering on Mulholland drive.<br /><br />Something that really gets my attention is how David Lynch wrote a story that so strongly suggests a co-dependence in all the elements in the movie but without tying them together through a certain conditioned logic as frame of reference, that is to say, you can sense how each fragment relates to any other fragment, but you cannot make them out to be a cohesive, normal narrative. If you want to feel as confused as the main characters, and find pleasure in that, you will certainly like M.D.
B00006RU5B|5.0|This is the greatest rock album of the new millennium. At first when I heard the rumours about the merge between Chris Cornell and what was left of Rage against the Machine I was sceptical, but when I got the album in my hand I saw the light!<br />Every song on this album is of a caliber that most other bands would give their left arm to have written. Not a weak spot anywhere - Buy it, and you´ll be in heaven to!<br />Cheers<BR>Jan T<BR>Stockholm

B000005JA8|1.0|It seems like there have been quite a few 1-star reviews of late, and I just wanted to add mine to the mix.  I've always hated this album, and every time I've been forced to listen to it, or pretend that I'm impressed that other people know about it, it kills me inside.  This CD represents everything wrong with experimental music - it's indulgent, pretentious, and worst of all: false.  This album is a lie, and all of the stories floating around about Beefheart's true musical skill or amazing, detailed work on this album are just canards.  Don't let the truth be obfuscated by a string of poorly thought out 5-star reviews.  This was a pile of garbage, thrown together without care, and unleashed on a stupid public.  I can't think of anything more offensive than the gall of Mr. Van Vliet to expect people to put up with stuff like this.  What's worse are the buffoons who fell for it.  Don't be one yourself.

0783219733|4.0|I would regard this as a good family film with some reservations. Since I remember how much I used to watch this when I was a kid, I remember what parts I enjoyed and what parts I didn't. It's okay to have a darker side to a family movie, but perhaps not with such unnecessary rough dialogue and violence with an evil veteranarian attacking and abusing animals. And since when does a father earn praise and honor from his wife and children when he punches out the bad guy?<br />The strength and the fun of this movie comes from the family who adopts a lost St. Bernard puppy, much to the father's dismay. The three children in this film, Ryce, Ted, and Emily (played by Nicholle Tom, Christopher Castile, and Sarah Rose Karr) are cute enough; what I like so much about this movie is the way they're shown as such a normal, loving, typical family that many of us could probably say we have seen before somewhere in our own lives. You've got the grumpy yet loving father, the nurturing \\"stay at home\\" mother, and the three mischievous kids. Overall, it's a film you might enjoy with your family...worth at least a rental.
B000000LZV|5.0|What could be romantic to Mike Watt?  Or to D. Boon and George Hurley, for that matter?  On DNOTD, Hurley pounds the 'skins like a man possessed, Watt twangs the hell out of his 'ol four-string, and D. Boon brings it on home with a staccato guitar and a \\"take no prisoners\\" singing voice.  <br />In epic scope on a \\"model railroad\\" scale, this album rivals the entire 'oeuvre' of Pink Floyd;<br />In single album stylism and range it rivals the Clash's seminal _London Calling_, ranging from thrash to instrumental to jazzy jams to popular theme music appropriated by the show \\"Jackass\\" (_Corona_) and some Nissan commercial (_Love Jam_);<br />In originality, it rivals Muddy Waters, Chuck Berry, and Louis Armstrong; masters of the past, and carries their legacy in spirit, if not in form;<br />And in brevity, their strongest suit?  The equivalent would be like a femtosecond snapshot in the life of a U-235 atom. (Postscript: a femto- is a verrrrry short period of time).<br />Five star ratings are often handed out like grocery receipts on this website, but I feel that this album and this band (like only a scattered few others) are truely worthy of the attention. DNOTD is the Minutemen's best album, it is perhaps the best album from the California punk scene of the late 70s- early 80s, one of the best albums of the entire genre of punk, and, well,...you get the progression.  <br />43 songs in under 55 minutes?  How could you go wrong?
B00005JLSC|5.0|Upon hearing of this movie musical, I was unsure how it would be done, considering the track record of movie musicals, a majority of them usually don't have too many songs breaking up the dialogue, either that, or they're pure musicals, all song and NO dialogue.  I had never seen the Broadway Musical, but I did know of it thanks to my girlfriend, who has seen the musical and exposed me to the soundtrack about a year or so earlier.  Being that I came into this film without seeing the stage version, it meant that I would be unbiased, and would have no basis for comparison, which was good.  Regardless of that, I have to say that the movie version of 'Chicago' is simply....  OUTSTANDING!!!  I was fully entranced, it was magical, it was funny, it made me feel GREAT!!  And to people who have seen the stage version, you'll love this film.  The acting, the singing, everything about this film was simply on point.  Catherine Zeta-Jones put in a fabulous performance as Velma Kelly, with some zest, pizazz, attitude, some fancy footwork, and some great singing as well.  Renee Zellwegger definitely did a fabulous job as Roxy Hart, with her cupie dolls looks and Betty Boop voice, she was great.  What surprised me the most was the absolutely extraordinary performance given by Richard Gere.  I had no idea he could sing, or dance for that matter, but he does both exceptionally well.  His portrayel of Billy Flynn simply oozed with charm, wit, smooth slickness, but enough heart to make him a loveable character, despite the fact that he's an opportunistic slimeball.  all in all, this is a fabulous film, something that will leave you smiling well after you've left the theater.
B00005YXZH|5.0|In a world full of one-hit pop stars, these guys provide a refreshing album full of well-written songs.  They're not trying to impress anyone and not trying to hit the top of the billboards.  Tweedy's written a bunch of songs that are simple, melodic, and timeless.  They're definitely influenced by music from the 70's, but you can also hear modern-day influences as well.  I don't recommend a lot of CD's, but if you're a fan of good music, you'll enjoy this one.  Give it a few listens and I think you'll come away with a smile on your face.
0375823360|5.0|These books are beautifully written, thoughtful and, in the end, hopeful. The story will hold the imagination of children that have enjoyed Harry Potter, Lord of the Rings, and the like. I suppose if you are a staunch Christian, you should stay away. But for the rest of us, these books present the universe in all its wondrous, mysterious, magical complexity.
0553278223|5.0|An interesting tale of how humans interact with another world. The premise of colonization is tertiary to the actual stories that abound in this series written over 50 years ago.<br />The stories themselves are vignettes that tell of life on Mars, but in classic Brabury style, they have other tales to tell. Principle to the first few stories is the human race's 'virus like' defeat of the Martian planet's defenses. Is Bradbury staking an early claim to a title of environmentalist? Another is the constant examples of how humans who are seeking to escape problems on Earth simply recreate them on Mars.<br />Political corrrectness is most definitely lacking in some stories, but the overall brilliance of the series should not be pulled down by overzealous censors.<br />This is an excellent SciFi series that should be read by all who call themselves fans of the genre.
B000002UJQ|5.0|Believe what you read about this album. Not only is it one of the decade's best, it's one of the all-time best. This is also the 1,000 review for this album on this site. Neato.
B000059ZLH|5.0|if you're reading this review, you're probably at least, a bit familiar with the band dream theater.  if you're not, know that they are 4 (5 if you count the lead singer, james labrie) of the most talented musicians on the face of the planet.  dream theater's &quot;metropolis 2000- scenes from new york&quot; proves this beyond a shadow of a doubt.<br />what's great about this dvd is that it shows the complete performance of their album &quot;metropolis part 2- scenes from a memory&quot; in it's entirety.  instead of getting a bunch of songs from a band's newest release, added to a bunch of old favorites, you get one of the greatest rock albums (this is no exaggeration- it's up there with pink floyd's &quot;the wall,&quot; queensryche's &quot;operation: mindcrime&quot; and other albums of similar ilk) of all-time, performed live.  not only that, but the extras, not included on the vhs version of this show, contain an additional hour of live material performed the same evening- three epic dream theater pieces: &quot;a change of seasons&quot; (which is 25 mins long, and the only official live release of this song), &quot;learning to live,&quot; and the three-part song &quot;a mind beside itself.&quot;  this added bonus, itself, is more than worth the price of admission.<br />the only bad thing i could say about this dvd is that, throughout the show, you're &quot;treated&quot; to some 80's style &quot;special effects&quot; that look more like a bad experience with acid than anything else.  the good news is, that it's not overwhelming.  still, if it weren't for the extra bonus footage, this might've caused me to rate the dvd a 4 instead of a 5.<br />the most important thing to realize here, is that this band has more musical talent and ability in one member's toe than any other popular band today has in their entire band.  and you get to see them live.  john petrucci truly is a master of guitar.  you hear him on a cd and think &quot;that's not possible.  there must be some over-dubs or other tricks involved.&quot;  and then you see him live, and still can't believe it.  mike portnoy on drums is the only drummer alive (w/ maybe the possible exception of carter beauford- highly underrated) who can be mentioned in the same breath as neil peart.  (mike portnoy also directed this dvd, and did a fantastic job!)  john myung is probably the most underrated bassist alive.  probably because he's shy and isn't concerned with critical acclaim.  but his bass riffs are more complicated than most band's guitar riffs.  and jordan ruddess is amazing on keyboards.  this guy does it all.  james labrie, the lead singer, isn't anything to write home about, but he is good, and his voice and style fit almost perfectly with the music the band plays.<br />conclusion- buy this dvd if you're a fan of dream theater.  buy this dvd if you're a fan of great live performances.  and most importantly, if you respect GOOD music, and you're not very familiar with dream theater, BUY THIS DVD.  you will NOT be dissapointed.  the musical talent these guys possess is just sick.  every musician is a virtuoso (three of them met at the berkley school of music) and stand head-and-shoulders above their peers.  besides, the music is just plain GOOD.
B00004SYWZ|5.0|a-ha's comeback album is a treat, indeed.  It's a dark-sounding album, with interesting melody choices and fun lyrical content.  &quot;Summer Moved On&quot;  redefines the term &quot;power ballad&quot; - it is, to my mind, the perfect meld of Paul Waaktaar-Savoy's songwriting and Morten Harket's voice.  The title track is a fun dance-type song; &quot;The Sun Never Shone That Day&quot; is a rocking song that makes interesting reference to their earlier work.  The highlight of the album, for me, is the final track - &quot;Mary Ellen Makes The Moment Count.&quot;  &quot;Velvet&quot; is a familiar song for anyone who followed Waaktar-Savoy's other project, Savoy, and, while I love it here on this album, I do actually prefer Paul's vocal.  <br />This album delves into the darker aspects of life; it's a wonderfully mature album from a band that most Americans still associate with 'silly' 80's pop.  If you're looking to shatter your expectations, give this one a listen!
B000062Y98|5.0|German Gods Blind Guardian spend a year composing their latest, \\"Night at the Opera,\\" and come out with an astoundingly massive sound that demands our full attention.<br />I've got to be honest:  I'm still trying to wrap my mind fully around this one.  Most bands de-volve into ever increasing spirals of simplicity and commerciality over the years.  Blind Guardian is doing the exact opposite.  Every iteration of the band grows more and more progressive.  My prog-fan friends are literally freaking out over this band:  they aren't doing what they're supposed to!  It's getting even more brave, even more groundbreaking!<br />And, in the case of \\"Night at the Opera,\\" much more huge. <br />In fact, during the hallowed \\"Tales from the Twilight World\\" years, when BG's impact was first being felt in Europe and Japan (and for the lucky few of us here in the US), this band was clearly a speed metal band with a twist:  their sound was actually UPLIFTING at times, an anomaly in the genre (Yahoo still has them classified as \\"Death Metal\\"--incredibly insulting).  With their latest release, Blind Guardian have fully incorporated their ultra-speed roots with totally new styles.  Truly, Blind Guardian has the most significantly unique sound of any band in the last 10 years.  From mere speed metal with a gimmick, BG has become the most universally un-definable heavy act I've ever seen.  Yes, they're Power Metal, but...  Yes, it's Progressive, but...  Yes, it's got some Queen-esque overtones at times, but...<br />You can't pin them down, other than to say, \\"It's really heavy, and really intense.\\"  And maybe that's the way it should be.<br />\\"Night at the Opera\\" must be experienced with a clear head and a sound mind.  Songs like \\"Punishment Divine,\\" \\"Under the Ice,\\" and \\"The Soulforged\\" will undoubtedly satisfy even the heaviest appetite.  \\"Sadly Sings Destiny,\\" with it's epic chorus, will quench the listener's thirst for a hook.  But even these massive tracks have elements rarely seen in heavy music.  Unexpected breaks abound, even in the most vanilla moments of the album.<br />Other songs, such as \\"Age of False Innocence\\" and the incredibly diverse \\"Wait for an Answer,\\" take the band in directions fans might not be comfortable with.  But that's exactly what makes this album undeniably relevant.  The band is moving, working, evolving.  After many, many years--it's still happening with these guys.  Their 7th album, unlike many other bands, reveals a unit vital with energy, fertile with creativity, and ripe with talent.  Would fans accept anything less from BG?  Not a chance.<br />We've all watched with amazement as a little-known post-Maiden speed metal band called \\"Blind Guardian\\" grew into a true power in modern heavy music.  Now nothing can deny them their just rewards.  They have become legends in their own time, in spite of the mainstream's ignorance.  Their latest tour, which includes dates in the US for the first time, proves as much.  Sold out shows in Atlanta and Chicago (both of which I was priviledged enough to attend) became unforgettable events we lucky few will cherish for a lifetime.<br />Buy this album.  Not for quick thrills, for there are none.  But for lasting, deeply fulfilling, musical satisfaction.
B0000797IO|1.0|I am a huge Jennifer Aniston fan, however I have seen her in better scripts.  Her performance was good for what the film was.  I personally did not enjoy the story line.  Normally I watch a film to escape and feel good, as you do with a good book.  But, this movie bored and depressed me.  Anytime someone dies in the end it makes you wonder what was the point of spending two hours of my life to watch a film.
B0000648WZ|5.0|I break the audiences into 2 divisions for this movie.  Those that hate it and those who love it.  I fall on the side that loves it.  It has wonderful action and it is always nice to see the training the troops go through and all of the dialogue is nice.  The special edition contains very little that is new from the old version, but I would still recommend having this version more.  I wish that they would release like a &quot;Criterion Collection&quot; for this movie or something.  The sound and picture is superb.  I really cannot say too much about this movie, other than I love the film and the DVD comes with many extra features.  Buy this!  OH P.S.  I want them to release a Starship Troopers 2 please!
0060537639|4.0|Gavin Menzies' \\"1421: The Year China Discovered America\\" presents a fascinating premise: in the year 1421 a huge armada set forth from China to explore the oceans of the world, visiting not only India and East Africa, already known to the Chinese from previous expeditions, but also West Africa, the American continents, Australia, and even Antarctica decades or centuries before European explorers reached those same shores.  But when the survivors of this great endeavor returned to China a profound change at the highest levels of the government had taken place, a change that ruptured contact with the outside world.  China withdrew within itself, destroyed the records of the expedition, and the great adventure was forgotten.  Nonetheless, critical information about their discoveries was conveyed to the West, sparking the European age of exploration.<br />It is tempting to dismiss Menzies as being simply yet another in a long line of authors who have proposed extremely ambitious revisions to traditional history based upon much speculation and little solid evidence.  We have all seen books that offer the true stories behind the Pyramids and Great Sphinx of Egypt, the Holy Grail, King Arthur, Atlantis, and a host of similar topics - books that promise much but soon fade from sight. Yet, Menzies does outline a large body of evidence in support of his theory.  Perhaps most crucial are old maps dating from the 15th and early 16th Centuries which appear to show in persuasive detail coastlines of the Americas, Australia, and Antarctica long before European ships reached those shores.  Menzies believes that these maps originated in the Chinese explorations, the information passed on to foreign contacts even while it was being obliterated at home.  (Other amateur revisionist historians have sought to explain such maps by resorting to ancient sea-kings in a pre-Ice Age world or even to extraterrestrial visitors; Menizies' theory seems almost sedate in comparison.)  In support of this idea, he quotes from contemporary accounts that European explorers finding \\"new\\" lands admitted that they were guided by existing maps.  Menzies' partiality towards maps and questions of navigation is undoubtedly grounded in his background as a former commander of a Royal Navy nuclear submarine.  The experience gave him, as he describes it, a \\"periscope's eye\\" view of lands seen from the sea, valuable in interpreting what might be shown on a centuries-old chart.<br />There is a broad array of other evidence mentioned by Menzies: inscribed stones at numerous locations around the world, the supposed presence of Asiatic chickens and African coffee in the Americas before Columbus, the reported growth of American maize in southeast Asia before Europeans provided a link across the Pacific, Chinese-style structures in various places, mysterious old shipwrecks which seem to be Chinese junks (including one in a sandbar along California's Sacramento River), possible Chinese colonies in New England and Portugese colonies in Puerto Rico well before Columbus ...  The list of presumed evidence appears endless.<br /><br />However - there is always a \\"however\\" in these things - can we be confident that Menzies has properly evaluated and presented this seemingly overwhelming body of information?  Footnotes are rather sparse, something which must make the careful reader cautious.  By Menzies' own acknowledgement, the validity of some pieces of his evidence has already been strongly challenged in the past: the stone tower of Newport in Narragansett Bay, the controversial Vinland Map, and the mysterious underwater \\"roads\\" of Bimini.  Menzies has stated that additional detailed supporting material will appear on his Internet website, but as yet I have seen little there of this promised data.<br />Given the bold nature of Menzies' proposal and the broad scope of information presented, it seems inevitable that at least some of Menzies' evidence will be shown to be in error.  But might enough of it eventually be proven correct to validate his ideas?  There are a number of paths of research suggested by Menzies for further pursuit, including archaeological excavation of the Sacramento River wreck and of mounds on the beaches of Bimini, DNA analysis of plants, animals, and peoples in many places ordinarily presumed isolated from one another, caron-14 dating of artifacts sitting on museum shelves, and so forth.  Perhaps, the thesis of the great expedition of 1421 will be found to be too narrowly phrased, while the broader matter of pre-Columbian contact with the Americas will be buttressed.  Quite possibly some of the more ambitious Chinese exploits described by Menzies, such as a voyage around the north of Greenland and the exploration of the north coast of Siberia, will be pruned away, leaving a more solid central core intact.  Or maybe in the end the whole thesis will be discarded.  But before that happens, I would hope that a serious look be given to Menzies' ideas and the underlying evidence.  The Chinese of the 15th Century, we now understand, certainly did have vessels capable of long ocean voyages, and we should not be so Eurocentric to preclude the notion that East Asian explorers could have made their own wide-ranging explorations.  And that detailed information on those old maps had to come from somewhere, after all.  Was it more than only imagination and luck?<br />\\"1421: The Year China Discovered America\\" makes for a fascinating reading experience with much in it worthy of further thought, but I would also recommend to the prospective reader that caution be exercised against taking everything at face value.  At the same time, the reader would be well-advised to keep an open mind to the possibility that the ancient Chinese at least briefly knew far more of the external world than we had ever realized and that this information helped kindle the flames of European exploration.t enough of it eventually be proven correct to validate his ideas?

6302548195|5.0|I managed to get a *NEW* copy of this movie yesterday.  Don't expect to watch some awing, breathless, unforgettable, and the best of all Arnold movies.  But what you can expect is a nice documentary about how Arnold and other competitors go through the Mr.Olympia Bodybuilding contest.  I found it to truly be interesting for a documentary, but also let me say that I am a big Arnold Schwarzenegger fan.  I wouldn't say that it worth [money]used, but I would say that if you can get a nice deal(like me), then this is a nice addition to your collection.  Arnold throws some of his humor in, and I feel that I learned more about bodybuilding in this movie, than I knew before I turned it on.  If anyone here has Cinemax, then right now, the special 25th anniversary edition of Pumping Iron is on cinemax this month.  It is a special edition and UNCUT!  Get your VCR ready!  Some footage in this isn't availabe in the normal version.  Go to [website]to find out when it will be on.  Remember that the times will be displayed in eastern I think.  Good Luck!
0446608955|5.0|I had to make myself put this book down. I read it after seeing the movie, but the book is definatey better. I was reading it during testing at my old school last year and had to (&amp; succeeded in) stopping myself from crying. It was a marvelous book, as are all of the Nicholas Sparks books I have read. My mother and I love him and his books. I totally reccommend this book to everyone. Even if you don't like reading (like one of my friends who read and loved it), you'll fall for Landon and long for the love he shows Jamie. You have to read this book. It's a must-have.
B00006J3WH|5.0|First off, if you haven't seen the musical, Once More With Feeling, you may not understand what is going on in the music! The cd ties in very well with the episode, and I love the lyrics they are so witty. If you saw the episode you will love this cd!
B00006AFUR|5.0|I initially downloaded a few songs because I just didn't think this would turn out to be anything good (I was expecting another actor failing in music), but I was wrong. It was just the type of music I wanted to listen to, and the songs all fit together great. It just works. I actually found a sampler CD from about 3 years ago with them on it that I had liked, but forgotten about. <BR>There were some comments about the band's live show. I missed many earlier shows, but when I did see them, I thought they were fine. The sound was a little off, but more to technical problems than anything that the band was doing wrong. Maybe they had some bad nights, maybe this was a better night, or maybe they have just improved with time.
B00004Z459|5.0|this album is good for anyone who likes rock, but doesn't want to hear explict lyrics. Also if you don't mind language, you still might find you like most of their songs. They are very well written, and I can relate to most of them. rock on!
0790729652|5.0|michael keaten is batman. in the first installment of 4 movies batman must face off against the JOKER and bruce wayne needs to keep his love life in tact without blowing his secret. this is the best movie of the BATMAN saga and will most likley stay the best. for any batman fan i reccomend this movie.
B00000DHRZ|5.0|No matter how many times these songs were/are overplayed, they never get old or boring.  Definatley recommended to any punk/hard rock fan, since it's a combination of those, and a little bit of rap (not too much, but enough to make some songs funky.)  The strongest songs on the album are: \\"Pretty Fly For A White Guy\\" and \\"The Kids Aren't Alright.\\"  Even though there are no bad songs on this album.<br />Go out and get it, an essential CD to any collection.<br />Don't burn it because it includes a CD extra including: videos from older albums, home videos, Offspring songs without vocals that you can sing along to, and much more!!!
B00000IQC8|3.0|yep wrote this one too.<BR>ok i love the jersey saga, but something about this was just diferent.it wasnt the color it wasnt the picture or the people(dante, randal,caitlen,veronica)although some of them ... me off.maybe it was the lack of jay and silent bob.why the ... am i ranting on about sensles things.if you like the jersey saga buyt it today.
B00005YXZH|5.0|I don't know what the people at NARAS were smoking but apparently they missed hearing one of the most amazing albums to come out of 2002. Next to Tori Amos' \\"Scarlet's Walk\\", the fools at NARAS failed to recognize Wilco's latest album \\"Yankee Hotel Foxtrot\\". I'm not really a big fan of country music or even this so-called alternative country movement but I have been hearing so many good things about \\"Yankee Hotel Foxtrot\\" that I had to get it. Actually \\"Summerteeth\\" was my first Wilco album and I really enjoyed that album. I was just waiting to find a copy of \\"Yankee Hotel Foxtrot\\" in the used cd bins at my favorite record store. Thankfully I found a copy over the summer. Considering the story behind the album, I was expecting the music to be inaccessible and not very radio-friendly. Oh how wrong I was (and you too Warner Bros.). \\"Yankee Hotel Foxtrot\\" is extremely radio-friendly, well maybe with the exception of \\"I Am Trying to Break Your Heart\\", a almost 7-minute opus. Jeff Tweedy's fragile vocals lend to a emotional tinge to the songs, especially on songs like \\"War On War\\", \\"Ashes of American Flags\\", and \\"Poor Places\\". I found the songs all melodic and catchy. I am still steamed over the fact that \\"Yankee Hotel Foxtrot\\" was ignored by the Grammy committee and while most of the nominees are all championed by MTV and VH1 (major snoozefest). NARAS really needs to listen to \\"Yankee Hotel Foxtrot\\" and especially tracks like \\"Poor Places\\" and \\"Pot Kettle Black\\". That is just some of the most amazing music I have heard in the past year (that wasn't signed to Metropolis Records).
B000053VAF|5.0|i wrote this a long time ago but...wouldnt let me post so now you can see it.<br />two renagade angels were banished two wisconsin now they found a way back to heaven with one side effect... it will unmake everything. the characters(bethany, jay, silent bob, azrael, loki, bartelby, rufeus, serindipity, and the triplets. lets not forget the golgothan)all have a quest either to help detroy man kind or save it. i was very happy when i saw this movie. i reccomend you buy it unless... your very religios.
B00004STPT|5.0|To be brutally honest, I thought the movie &quot;Gladiator&quot; was one big bore to watch. Granted that movie was definitely one of Russell Crowe's better films but as a whole, I found myself bored with the epic film. It was loud and bombastic in terms of quality like a Jerry Bruckheimer/Michael Bay film but with actors who can actually act. The film score however is an excellent piece of work. One of the best I thought. I have always enjoyed the works of Hans Zimmer and Lisa Gerrard (ex-Dead Can Dance). The entire cd takes the listener back to the film. You can envision every scene according to the tracklist. The production is excellent. When I close my eyes and listen to tracks like &quot;The Battle&quot;, I can almost find myself in the recording studio where the conductor is directing the orchestra. Next to &quot;Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon&quot;, &quot;Gladiator&quot; is one of my top personal favorite film scores ever.
B000002IOW|1.0|If you are new to Rush, or if you forgot all about this band for the past 20 years or so (as I did), skip this one. At one time, these guys were on the same level with Zeppelin and Floyd. Presto sounds as if it was recorded in a tin can. There is no bottom end, and the songs are B-O-R-I-N-G! Insipid lyrics, melodious hum-drum, and 3 musical gods who, somehow, somewhere, fogot how to play. Anagram ranks up there with Vital Signs as possibly the 2 worst songs Rush ever did (I take that back...up to Presto, nothing was as bad as Vital Signs). The album is so polished and smooth that it sounds as if the whole thing is being played on computers. The only cut worthy of mentioning is Scars. But the tempo should have been slowed down. Lifeson has some good guitar work, and Lee's bass line is interesting, but Peart sounds as if he is playing a kit full of snares. The song just doesn't work. Hard to believe that these guys were on top of the world between 1976 & 1982. Can you imagine Entre Nous or Xanadu or Camera Eye being done in this style? This album is just awful.
0060537639|5.0|clofo s review is not helpful. He attacks the book on an emotional basis  and appears to be a lazy thinker.Methinks a better  and more valid way  would be to examine the source material listed by Menzies  and to consult  scholars on the subject. Mr Clofo s evaluation is hasty. Lets hear from some academics gifted with the power of rational thought and the appropriate background.
B00005U8EM|5.0|Groundhog Day is the funniest movie of the 90's. Brilliant performance by Bill Murray who plays a cocky weatherman Phil Connors who covers Groundhog day every year in the small town of Punxatawnee that he hates. The day end with him being stuck there because of a blizzard that he didn't predict...and what more, he relives groundhog day over and over again...taking advantage of it, taking his own life, making a move on his producer Andie Macdowell which turns out to be his first lesson in reviewing his inner cruelty and becoming a better person, and a local hero!<br />This movie is straight out funny...it will make you crack up with every viewing. Watch out for Stephen Tobolowski in his bizarre role as Ned Ryerson, and a cameo appearance by the film's director (and Murray's costar in Ghostbusters) Harold Ramis.<br />The features are well worth the money too.
B000002HFU|5.0|Pros: Anybody making a remake of this album will only stumble and make a wack album. There is no way this album can be redone (not even by ODB himself).  Its crazy, its hard to get into but its defenitly worth it when you do.  Lazy listeners, I suggest you try something else, maybe some Nas, if you want to listen to real rap (he's great). This is the rap fan's album, the hardcore one. Definitly one of the greatest albums of all time nobody knows why. I'll tell you why: ODB gots S-O-U-L. You can tell because while his rhymes are simple and sometimes stupid (albeit fun as hell), there is nobody who can imitate him.  After Cuban Linx and Liquid Swords, this is my favorite Wu-Tang (solo) album with Ironman and Tical coming close.<br />Cons: I just have one complaint, I wish that extended version of &quot;Shimmy Shimmy Ya'll&quot; (the one we hear on the video and then some) was here instead of the one we got, but its still a great song.
B000002AZ8|3.0|Vitalogy is one of the best rock albums to come out of the post-grunge era; even though in 1994 grunge was still sort of out there with fake-acts and with Soundgarden and Alice In Chains. But still that doesn't take away from the fact that 'Vitalogy' is a good; not great album.  Songs off of this are catchy; and some flat out rock, but the overall mix of the albums songs seem to be weird. Take the hard fast rock song 'Spin The Black Circle' being followed by the gentle 'Not For You' and then followed that by 'Tremor Christ' and 'Nothingman'; the lineup of the album seems puzzling. But besides all that the songs off of this are good songs; and only a few of them: 'Betterman', 'Corduroy' , and 'Immortality' i would call great songs; but they are the only GREAT songs off of this album, every other one is decent, i guess. But all in all this is a good album; but not one of the best.
B00001IVOR|5.0|Enter the 36 Chambers is one of the top 5 rap albums of all time and one of the top music albums ever. Now with that said, Wu-Tang Foverver is more advanced than 36 Chambers (not meaning that its better).  The lyrics throughout the WHOLE album is one step ahead anything else they made (except maybe Liquid Swords).<BR>Their is no catchy hook on this one (for better or worse), just great lyrics. Nobody lags, but the ones that really shine on this album is the RZA. For some reason he is just ON. I've never heard RZA like this before (and sadly neither have I heard him like this after).  Check this line from <BR>&quot;Severe Punishement&quot; &quot;As the pendulum swings close to the millenum 2000, wickedness is spread amongst my citizens&quot; And his entire verse in &quot;Duck Seazon&quot;. <BR>This album is more mature and experimental (check the song structure in Deadly Melody) then 36 chambers wich is why some people might be put of by that album.  I can't praise this album enough. This is truly an artistic achievement greatly misunderstood and while a commercially succesful album (mostly due to its hype) its an even more underrated album.
B00006RU5B|2.0|Boooooo!!!  We want Zach back!  Breaking up the foursome of Rage Against the Machine has got to be one of the stupidest acts in rock history!  They had so much going for them, and then they threw it all away.  Not only did they toss away the greatness they had acheived, they brought in some ... vocalist like Chris Cornell.  Did something happen to his voice since the days of Soundgarden?  Because he sure doesn't sound like the Chris Cornell of \\"Black Hole Sun\\".  As for their debut album, maybe the only good song is \\"Show Me How to Live\\".  But what's with Chris' voice at the end?  He sounds terrible.  \\"Like a Stone\\", isn't bad either, but I can only imagine how bored poor Tom Morrello must have been.  Aaah, Tom, why did you do it?  Every other song on the ablum sounds like some bad rendition of \\"Bombtrack\\" or \\"Ghost of Tom Joad\\".  And the lyrics just don't add up to what they had before.  If Chris doesn't want to be in a political band, fine, but why does he have to go record songs like \\"I am the Highway\\" and \\"Hyptonize\\"?  ... God, how I miss the days of \\"Guerilla Radio\\" and \\"Bulls on Parade\\".
B00004BZ0N|5.0|It's a mistake to try to classify this recording as punk or rock or whatever. Remember, it was recorded over 20 years ago, yet it still sounds fresh! Yes, The Clash crossed out of the binds of punk for this but they gave the music world new horizons to strive for and brought us along for the ride. Some of these songs rock, some soar and some move us. The sum of it all is brillance. Don't classify it, just listen to it and enjoy.
B000069AUI|5.0|I recommend both Parachutes and A Rush of Blood to the Head to anyone who is into Alternative music. I'll never get tired of listening to both of these albums. Lead singer Chris Martin is an absolute genius and I hope he continues along with the rest of band in the future.
B00006RU5B|5.0|If you plan on buying a new cd this year and you haven't purchased this cd yet,  then you should.  This album has all the great aspects of any great record.  It can make your nose bleed while at the same time put you to sleep.  Morello's chunky guitar riffs mixed with Cornell's melodic banshee-type vocals brings us back to the days of simple guitar, drum, bass, and vocal bands.  The record hasn't been overproduced, (unlike a lot of records these days), and has a wide range of simple, creative sounds. Tracks like &quot;I Am the Highway&quot; and &quot;Hypnotize&quot; may drag you into a calm, euphoric state.  While &quot;Set It Off,&quot; &quot;Cochise,&quot; and &quot;Show Me How to Live&quot; will bury your face in the ground.  Almost every song on the record features undeniable &quot;how do you do that?&quot; solos brought to the table by Morello's creative genius.  Commerford's bass and Wilk's drumming techinques add a solid bottom end to each tune, respectively. And though Chris Cornell is in his mid-thirties, he can still give us those high, scorching vocals that we all know and love so well.  For fans of both old and new, this cd is a must have.  There's no better feeling than buying a new cd and knowing that you got your money's worth.
B00005JKCH|4.0|I almost didn't watch this movie--just not too big on Science Fiction types.  However, I'm glad I decided to bring it home for the night.  <br />The story line is ok.  Loner boy gets magic power, loses his uncle, and finds the ones he loves threatened by the mysterious Green Goblin.<br />The best part of the movie are the incredible jump scenes where Spiderman hurtles himself through NYC.  The fight scenes are also pretty neat...kind of reminiscent of The Matrix.<br />If you want a movie that you watch strictly for the filming, this is probably it.
B00006RU5B|5.0|If you plan on buying a new cd this year and you haven't purchased this cd yet,  then you should.  This album has all the great aspects of any great record.  It can make your nose bleed while at the same time put you to sleep.  Morello's chunky guitar riffs mixed with Cornell's melodic banshee-type vocals brings us back to the days of simple guitar, drum, bass, and vocal bands.  The record hasn't been overproduced, (unlike a lot of records these days), and has a wide range of simple, creative sounds. Tracks like &quot;I Am the Highway&quot; and &quot;Hypnotize&quot; may drag you into a calm, euphoric state.  While &quot;Set It Off,&quot; &quot;Cochise,&quot; and &quot;Show Me How to Live&quot; will bury your face in the ground.  Almost every song on the record features undeniable &quot;how do you do that?&quot; solos brought to the table by Morello's creative genius.

B00004R9A4|5.0|'Bedknobs and Broomsticks' is a 1971 Disney classic that showcases the brilliant talent of Walt Disney's legendary animators, even four of Walt Disney's Nine Old Men, some of his most trusted associates. It is a live-action/animation feature, and is not some happy-go-lucky Disney glitzy pop like today's Disney animation.<BR>This film is directed by Robert Stevenson and produced by Bill Walsh, the same creative team that brought Mary Poppins to the screen in 1964. Many things are the same about the picture; such as the children in the picture. The con-man was played brilliantly by David Tomlinson, who also was the father in Mary Poppins. Yet, one thing was different, it was clearly missing the creative endeavor of Walt Disney.<BR>Based on the novels by Mary Norton, 'Bedknobs and Broomsticks' is about a spinster named Eglantine Price, who lives in 1940 war-torn England, and is secretly a mail-order amateur witch. She is forced to take in three children because of the London bombings, and these kids are named Carrie, Charles and Paul. After a rocky start, the children find out Eglantine's secret about being a witch, and they become friends. Yet, Eglantine has to find a way to keep their mouths shut, since she does not want anyone to know she's a witch. So, the four of them seal a pact. Miss Price enchants a magic bedknob to keep the pact. In return the children will keep her secret. <BR>The bedknob, when put on the bed upstairs where it was taken from, will take them anywhere they want to be taken. Yet, their plans are changed when Eglantine learns that her teacher, Emelius Brown, has closed down the witch college, without mailing her the most important spell ever, Substitutiary Locomotion, which makes \\"inanimate objects take on a live force of their own\\" and Eglantine believes she can defeat the Germans with the spell.<BR>So Miss Price, Charlie, Carrie and Paul go to London, and there they meet Emelius Brown, who is obviously a terrible magician. Emelius claims that he lost the book in which the spell was, and they go to Portobello Road, a sort of farmer's market that sells fake second-hand items. Here Eglantine and company learn that Astoroth, a sorcerer, wore a necklace that had the magic words on it. They also learn that Astoroth kept animals in cages to make them more human-like. The animals rebelled and killed Astoroth, and stole the necklace. The necklace is on a neck of a lion on The Island of Naboombu. <BR>The animation starts here, when Eglantine, Emelius, and the children attend an underwater ballet, and also play a soccer game with the villianous lion on the Island of Naboombu, in which they manage to steal the necklace.<BR>Returning back home, the Locomotion spell flops, and Emelius leaves that night back to London to enter the war. That night, the Nazi Germans attack. After the Nazi's imprison Eglantine and the kids, Emelius returns secretly (by turning himself into a rabbit) and helps Eglantine and company get out.<BR>Working together, they use the Locomotion spell to mobolize an army of armor and defeat the Nazi Germans. Eventually, Emelius stays with Eglantine, Carrie, Charlie and Paul, but joines up with the army anyway.<BR>The bonus feautres are really great. The film is restored to its original length (after being cut numerous times before) and is remastered and restored fabulously. There is a Mickey and a Donald Duck short, and also a featurette on the making of the film, among other extras. <BR>I highly reccomend that you get this excellent film, and it deserves much more than 5 stars! It's a great film, your whole family will love it!
B000063S6Z|5.0|This cd has a very &quot;soul-y&quot; feel to it, but with a modern edge.  Very good cd, not a huge fan of &quot;Jam for the ladies&quot; but its not really a 'bad' track. Buy it if ya like Moby, you won't be dissapointed.
B0000797IO|3.0|Jennifer Aniston, as Justine, has always been a &quot;good&quot; girl and all it has gotten her is a mismatched husband who doesn't &quot;get&quot; her and a deadend job.  She is fed up with her life and is vulnerable to the attentions of a younger man who is a co-worker.  She finds him much deeper and more interesting than her husband and enjoys hearing him compare himself to Holden Caulfield in &quot;Catcher in the Rye&quot;.  The attraction blossoms into an affair which leads to further complications in her life.  Soon things are out of control and she continues to lie to cover up what she has done.  All around her, people's lives are crashing and she seems oblivious to it all, still concerned about her own self-interests.  The performances are good, but sometimes the humorous scenes clash a bit with the seriousness of the rest of the film.  The ending to this one is NOT predictable and the viewer is left to wonder until the end.
B00000IL1K|4.0|Sarah Brightman's amazing CDs, Time to Say Goodbye and La Luna had just the right balance of classical and pop/new age tracks.  Eden seems slanted in favor of the pop/new age type of music.  I for one think that Sarah's talent is best showcased in classics such as Nessun Dorma.  I wish Eden had more tracks like it.  Eden is still a great CD and one you'll listen to over and over.  But, it isn't Sarah's best work.  Hopefully her new CD, expected in Spring 2003 will be better.

B000068PNQ|3.0|It's nice to have the stereo and mono version in one package. But the compilers completely screwed up by adding along with disc one (consisting of the stereo version most people already have), Nico tracks from \\"Chelsea Girls\\" that most people already have. No doubt, CD 2 is an essential product to put on the market, so I may sound nitpicking here. But they should've either have sold disc 2 separately or, ideally, to make the double package with the stereo version (of which this is the third time I'm purchasing it) worth it, as a double CD with long overdue tracks long available on bootleg (but deprived from people who adhere to distribution laws as myself): the song \\"Chelsea Girl\\"'s demo with Lou Reed on guitar (with the proper dose of feedback), or the complete \\"Melody Laughter\\" (which has already been earlier compromised on the VU box set by being edited down to make room for these same Nico tracks). Let's get it straight, folks: Most people interested in this band have already long owned a copy of Nico's \\"Chelsea Girl\\" (and prefer the complete version). I know I'm essentially repeating what [another] reviewer said (of which \\"The Nothing Song\\" is unknown to me), but that's why I'm saying it. I suggest a new trend involving CD compilations: Let people who care compile them, (please)! a-hem.

0140367357|3.0|Edith Nesbit is a charming writer. She tells her story with wit and humour, and interjects sly digs that engender a wink and a smile, but while the premise is timeless and interesting, the prose is extremely dated, making the book a bit tedious to read for any length of time. Also, the ideas and prejudices exhibited by the characters date the material.<br />The five siblings of the title, who have found a Sand-fairy willing to grant them one wish a day, continually make silly wishes that get them into trouble. Their first wish is to be \\"as beautiful as the day\\". Right there you get a sense of the book's outdated charm. This is of interest more as a tribute to a talented children's writer of a bygone era rather than for its own sake.<br />I wanted to enjoy this classic, but I found it hard slogging through. That is just my opinion, however, but I'd suggest you read a bit of the text before purchasing it unless you're already familiar with, or particularly interested in, author Nesbit.<br />Caveat: The occasional black-and-white line drawings are by H.R. Millar, not the Paul Zelinsky watercolors promised in the Editorial Reviews section.
0871137380|5.0|This book was great and was actually the book that lead me to be one of Bowden's greatest fans. Black Hawk Down gives you what you want. It gives you the action of the whole scenario, the feelings, emotions, and the view from the outside. For a person like me, who likes reading books of the supposed &quot;good&quot; guys of war vs. the &quot;bad&quot;, I enjoyed this book greatly. I loved the vivid detail. People have been annoyed with Bowden leaving out any sort of glossary about weapons and such. When it really isn't needed because Bowden took the time to tell about the amount of damage and the explosion the certain aresenal created.
B00005JLRR|2.0|Perhaps the huge salary they paid to Patrick Stewart made the studio determined to figure out some way to make the fate of the cosmos depend upon him being in ever scene.  Do not get me wrong, Patrick Stewart is a wonderful actor, however this plot bordered on the ridiculous.<BR>The movie will remind you of the very first Star Trek movie with V-Jer.  A very long, very slow build up to an unexciting climax.  <BR>The thing that made movies like \\"The Wrath of Khan\\" work, was an exciting plot throughout the movie, supported by understandable motives and good character development, when needed.  This movie struggles to introduce a new villain with a silly motive, all filmed in a dark gloomy sound stage.<BR>the enterprise is summoned to Main planet of the Rommulan Empire because the new Preator wants to start negotiations.  They are suprised to hear that the new leader is not from the Planet Romulus but from it's sister planet Remus. (Fans of the books take note, this movie COMPLETELY departs from any continuity with the books, in which Romulus and Remus were twin planets jointly governing the empire and were colonized together.  In Nemesis, Remus is a locked in an orbit giving it a perpetual dark side, on which the remunds, a Pale, romulun subspecies resembling vampires, are used as slaves to mine the surface.<br />Picard and the crew meet the new leader, who strangly enough is human, and even stranger looks just like Picard 30 years earlier.  It is at this point that the movie completely withers, falling into a mass of cliches such as \\"Shields down to 40% Captain\\"<br />I hope that the rumors of this being the last Star Trek movie are false as it would be a true shame to end the movie on such a sour note.
B000003TAW|5.0|Ah, Weezer.  If there is one thing we can all agree on, it's our affection and appreciation for the musical genius of Rivers Cuomo and company.  This album is the epitome of a &quot;contemporary classic,&quot; with catchy tunes and smart lyrics that we can all relate to.  The work as a whole is rather indescribable!    Typical of song writer/ lead singer Cuomo, there is a sharp, sometimes cynical side to his words; but whether you buy this album intending to read 'between the lines' or not, its simplistic charm and perfection will undoubtedly brighten your day.  Look also for Weezer's other albums; but keep in mind that none surpass the 'mighty Blue'.
B00003CWTI|4.0|MAGNOLIA is one amazing film.  it is quite bizzare and you really have to pay attention.  it has a great cast and was one of the best films i have seen in a long time.  for me i am tired of cliche hollywood movies with happy ending and such.  i like differnet films.  i like art films which is what i consider this movie.  <BR>     it is the story of about nine people(i think , it is hard to keep track of all the people) and each of their stories intertwine  this makes it hard to keep up but if you like something different, this is it.  this movie deals with death, healing, forgiveness and many other subjects.  it is not really one straight story form a-b with subplots.  it is, like i said, about 9 people whose lives intersect.  <BR>     the dvd has some bonus stuff including: tv spots, movie teaser & trailer and a \\"diary\\" as well as the aimee mann video \\"Save me\\" and some other stuff but i found the movie was good but the dvd was just ok.  i was kind of bored through some of the diary.  the other features were ok but the movie is the real prize.
B00006JDVV|2.0|I predict this film will one day become one of those \\"so-bad-its-good\\" movies.  Thirty years from now audiences will enjoy watching just to count the number of plot holes and idiotic inconsistancies, laughing they're heads off.  The first dumb idea to kill the suspension of disbelief is the realization that the nations of the world, equiped wiith air-to-air heat-seeking missles mounted on supersonic jet fighters, couldn't kill a bunch of slow-flying reptiles.  But, miraculously, twenty years later, after the world is burned to ciders, a handfull of humans bring down dragons from a single helicopter using skydivers carrying - get this - nets!  Later on the dragonslayers get even more retro and go after the head dragon with - get this - crossbows and arrows!  Give me a break.  This would have been a much better movie had it been a typical knight vs. dragon film.  The futuristic stuff is silly.  Someone please stop Rob Bowman before he directs again!
B000000W6R|5.0|If your just discovering the pumpkins then i reccomend keeping an eye out for billy corgan and company when it comes to b-sides.  some of his b-sides are as good as any thing he releases, sometimes better.  for example, i bought the single for the song ZERO and freequently play it as if it is an actual album.  <BR>     this album was released after siamese dream and before mellon collie.  it is amazing.  i think his cover of stevie nicks landslide outshines the original (and buries the dixie chix version) <BR>     this album is filled with both electric and acoustic songs.  another interesting note is that james iha sings on blew away.  i love pissant, an angry less than two minute blasting rocker that scorches my ears.  also girl named sandoz, plume and the 7 minute builidng beauty of starla which starts off acoustic but builds to electric with some great jazz drumming from drummer extraordinaire jimmy chamberlain.  <BR>     all in all this is as good an album as any &quot;official&quot; release.  sometimes when you hear b-side album, ytou think the material may be weaker but forget that idea when you speak of billy because when he writes, he really writes and not all his good songs are releases right away.  i knew most of the songs here because i collected the singles from siamese dream.  starla on the single i have is ten minutes plus where as on pisces it is chopped to 7 something.
B000021YQV|4.0|The album is good, good editing, good instrments, good everything, but I don't like politcal lyrics.  I just don't like them.  Conservative or Liberal, i just don't think music is the proper place to air out politcal views.
0920668372|5.0|Reading this book makes you realize that someone was able to put into words and pictures just how deeply the love for your children goes. My son loves to hear the mother whispering sweet nothings to her son while rocking him and loving him at every stage of his life.

B000066NW0|5.0|Avril Lavigne's debut album \\"Let Go\\" is quite different from recent pop stars.  She's definatly NOT slutty (like Brittany Spears) i think this music is good for most teenagers, because avril reflects on alot of regular teen problems. Her first single \\"Complicated\\" is about someone trying to be who their not. I think we've all had a friend who has that problem... It talks about her thinking her boyfriend/friend as being Complicated because he acts different around other ppl.  Sk8er Boi, (her next single) is a good pop/rock song. very catchy. her next single \\"I'm With You\\" shows more of a mellower side of Avril as she shows off her AMAZING voice. i recomend people who like Michelle Branch to get this CD. Although she doesn't ONLY talk about love, as Michelle Branch tends to do... For instance, her song \\"My World\\" talks about her life growing up in a small canadian town. This new singer is something else... since lately all u see is people like Brittany Spears, Shakira, ect. Avril Lavigne is exactly opposite, not a sex symbol. (but she IS hot) hehe. well gotta go. GET THIS CD
B000007T1M|1.0|System of a Down is the worst band that has ever existed, currently exists or will ever exist in the history of the world. How a no-talent collection of alt-metal posers can get a music contract is incomprehensible.
B00005AQE8|5.0|Tupac Shakur is hip hop and rap's premier embassador of the ghetto and street life.  His profound mother, Afeni Shakur, raised him to be a intelluctual leader to fight against the troubles of the black community living in a \\"white man's world\\".  All Eyez On Me is Tupac's fourth album and first since his bail from Rikers Island.  This CD contains all of Pac's accumalitive thoughts and ideas that he grasped from books and his experiences in his troubled life.  Book 1 contains all of the singles exept one, and demonstrates his Westside style in tracks like \\"All About U\\", \\"2 of Amerikkka'z Most Wanted\\", and \\"Cali. Love\\".  The production is good on this CD and his mostly done by Deathrow producer Daz Dillinger.  \\"I Aint Mad At Cha\\" is definetly the CD's best song.  The catchy piano laced background melody cradles Pac's lyrics of his thought of death.  \\"Only God Can Judge Me\\" and \\"Life Goes On\\" are two tracks that embarse Tupac's lyrical capability and also compensate his thoughts on death.  Book 2 alone can be sold as a seperate CD.  The style and production is a bit different but still keeps that Pac flavor.  Tracks like \\"Shorty Wanna Be a Thug\\" and \\"All Eyes On Me\\" make you realize how unique Tupac was.  \\"Picture Me Rollin\\" is the best laid back cruisin song that anyone can jam too while riding in their car.  Dr. Dre produced \\"Cant C Me\\" gives you that Westside feeling with a \\"bump\\".  All in all, F*#k Nas, Mobb Deep, and Bad Boy, nobody will ever sound like Tupac. Nobody will ever surpass his accomplishments and number of songs put out.  All Eyez On Me cannot be critiqued or hold one's opinon, yet only one can judge Pac and a world can listen to his talent.
B0000691TJ|5.0|After three albulms of experimenting with pop, the Ramones returned to form with 'Too Tough To Die', their eighth release.  Tommy and Ed Stasium, as Dee Dee acknowledges in Billy Altman's short booklet, were unsurpassed at capturing the Ramones in production, and this reunion lives up to expectations.  <br />This re-mastered albulm opens with the fleshed-out punk &quot;Mama's Boy&quot;, and veers through everything from pop (&quot;Howling At The Moon&quot;, &quot;Chasing the Night&quot;) to hardcore (&quot;Wart Hog&quot;, &quot;Endless Vacation&quot;).  Despite this wandering, it's difficult to find a mis-step to break the monotony of this gushing review.<br />The re-mastering work continues to be expertly performed, adding texture, depth, and clarity to even the rawest tracks.  This albulm, strong enough on its own, has been given a royal treatment with twelve bonus tracks, one of which may be one of the best Ramones covers ever; &quot;Street Fighting Man&quot;, rescuing a song that was formally an object of punk mockery.  The appeal of the demo versions could well be lost on the casual listener; some of them are mostly unpolished forms of the studio track, although Dee Dee's version of &quot;Planet Earth 1988&quot; has a blistering rawness the original lacks.<br />This is a much more mature effort than the classic first four releases, as one might expect from a band that was a decade old as of the first pressing of this albulm.  One can hear the Ramones acknowledging (or even upstaging) what other innovators did with the punk sound they created in the '70s, and still hear some lingering polish from their pop days.  Some punk purists will dismiss these tracks as irrelevant; a retreat to derivative mediocrity after an unsuccesful sell-out.  Instead of a retreat, however, this albulm is a surge forward with stomping foot and grinding guitar, demonstrating an energy and competence that reminds the listener why this band's fanbase will happily buy a re-mastered re-release.  If you want to skip the pop phase, this is the albulm to come back to the Ramones with.
B000001GRZ|5.0|I don't use to write reviews or comments, but reading previous ones rating this recording so low, I must do something to increase its value.<BR>I own the cello suites in several versions by Casals, Yo-yo Ma and Fournier's. This is the most &quot;Bachian&quot; and trustful to barroque spirit (don't know other versions)of all three. Very well recorded (that cello sounds as if was in your room), has tempo, virtuosity and emmotion. Yo-Yo Ma's is good, but lacks the tempo and has too much emmotion, I think it's not as trustful to Bach's intention, but is also worth listening. Casals is also outstanding, but the old recording quality sometimes takes focus away from the music.<BR>If you are looking for a first version for your collection or you are a music lover that already have it by other performers, you should have it or at least give it an audition. Its weakness (if any) is that Fournier's cello sometimes sounds so bass heavy that seems it has 5 or 6 strings, but it's very pleasant.
0694003611|1.0|My daughter (I bought the book when she was 6 months and she is now 14 months). She is totally not interested in the book. I personally did not like the book also. No story and boring... simply did not make sense. Pajama Time ! (Sandra Boyton), Dinosaur's Binkit (Sandra Boyton) and Good Night, Gorilla, are my daughter's favourite bedtime books.
B000069AUI|5.0|&quot;Coldplay&quot; follows up their 1998 hit album, &quot;Parachutes,&quot; with this gloriously real, drifting, play of music and light. This album has you ascending into aurora skies, dark galaxies and strewn constellations. <br />         Some of the best songs on this album are &quot;Clocks,&quot; with its repetitious beat, but beautiful melody it becomes addictive listening. The second best song is &quot;In My Place,&quot; which became the album's first single. This song is a thoughtful, projection of thoughts of being alone. The other tracks are just as good, but these two struck the most with me. <br />         Buy this if you want to be in the mood for relaxing, thoughtful rock &amp; roll.
0805047905|5.0|I bought this book when she was about 9 months. Simple, big and colourful pictures, with repeated words, the book is very good in teaching colors and simple sentence like 'what do you see?'. My daughter cannot wait for me to finish the sentences on each page and flips the pages herself! We read it very frequently.
B00006YXEK|5.0|Great for Harrison fans.  You can hear the happiness, sadness and sarcasm in George's vocals.  At times it seems like he's immitating Dylan.  His vocals build on the lyrics, which are among his best, and the melodies are reminiscent of the Wilbury era.  The classic Harrison slide is everywhere.

I don't think my eyes have ever hurt more, as I found myself reading this book non-stop, missing out on a lot of sleep!<br />The entire series of A Song of Ice and Fire are all the same. Martin is a true artist, he paints a picture of such detail showing us deep character development, as well as a detailed world surrounding that.<br />A Feast for Crows can't come soon enough. To tell you how well I liked this book, I UPS'd it 2-4 day, and I will do the same for book 4 due out soon.
B00005Q79B|3.0|'The Lights Of Zetar' is an episode that plays by it's own rules and the result is one of the poorest efforts of the original series.  The story was written by Shari Lewis, of \\"Lamb Chop\\" fame, and her husband Jeremy Tarcher, with the thought that she would be the female lead.  Thank goodness clearer heads prevailed!  The idea of a conscious body of interstellar beings traveling the galaxy looking for an escape from their incorporeal state isn't really a bad concept at all.  It's the way that they are defeated that's the problem here.<br />In the beginning we are introduced to Lt. Mira Romaine who the Enterprise is taking to Memory Alpha, an immense library sanctioned by the Federation and open to all.  The starship encounters an unusual phenomenon just before reaching their destination.  It appears onscreen as a multi-colored cloud that gives no discernible readings when scanned.  It soon penetrates the hull and disables the crew in various ways; the cloud assaults Lt. Romaine momentarily and later she has what she believes is a disturbing premonition concerning the Memory Alpha facility.  Within time the true identity of the mysterious cloud is discovered - and the crew also learns that Lt. Romaine has been chosen by them to fulfill a sinister and costly purpose.<br />What really hurts this episode is that Kirk, Spock and McCoy devise a way to defeat the Zetars that isn't quite plausible.  How will this method defeat the beings?  While you are watching this keep in mind they penetrated the ship's hull with no problems in the beginning of the show and also they have existed in zero gravity for millennia.  I'm going to guess that the episode may have had an earlier solution that wasn't practical in view of budget concerns; this ending was written as a substitute and was certainly easy for the special effects crew to pull off.  The result: It Stinks!  Any reasonably educated person isn't going to buy this explanation as presented.  The romance between Scotty and Lt.Romaine is a limp-legged plot element as well and it only gets in the way of the story, bogging it down with sappy and unlikely dialogue from the normally levelheaded engineer.<br />'The Cloud Minders' fares much better and introduces the city of Stratos that floats on a cloud, one of the most memorable fantasy elements created by Star Trek.  Upon arrival Spock meets an attractive and intelligent woman whose beauty so impresses him that he gives brief consideration to a romance.  But as you might have guessed something \\"sours\\" the milk for the first officer.<br />The Enterprise goes to the planet of Ardana to pick up a shipment of zenite, the antidote to an epidemic that has struck a Federation planet's vegetation and may destroy it all.  On the surface of Ardana Kirk and Spock are attacked by terrorists known as Disrupters; they are rescued within seconds by the ruler of Stratos, Plasus, who has come to the surface with two guards.  Returning to Stratos with Plasus, Kirk and Spock receive the explanation that the miners who live on the surface of Ardana are rebelling against their superior counterparts who live in the city of Stratos.  Kirk and Spock see the clear distinction between the classes of citizens and attempt to negotiate an understanding of their differences, running afoul of both of the warring parties, leading to several complications.<br />The mutual attraction between Droxine and Spock develops nicely; their conversations are believable and revealing, adding necessary insight to the two cultures depicted here.  Kirk takes the dire matters into his hands breaking all rules of diplomacy and shooting from the hip.  It's hard to believe that the Federation would tolerate Kirk's actions in this case despite the severity of the situation.  Apparently the creators of Trek realized this as you'll note by the final line of dialogue between Plasus and Kirk.  Another unintentional comical moment happens when the elegant and refined Droxine tells Spock that shewill go to the surface to work in the mines.  Yeah, right!  She wouldn't last 30 seconds in the completely foreign and harsh environment of the underground caverns.  Obviously she wishes to continue to further impress the intrepid Mr. Spock.
B00005JLSC|5.0|I really can't put into words how much I enjoyed this movie.  I won't go into the story as you can pick that up from the other reviews here and across the country.<br />I'll just say that this is a fun, brash, exciting, phenomenal film that I won't soon forget.  Catherine Zeta-Jones BLEW me away!! She is amazing and has a great voice.  Of course, she's also sexier than you can imagine.<br />One of the things I enjoyed the most about this film was the dancing/choreography.  The few musicals that have been relased over the last few years (\\"Evita\\", \\"Moulin Rouge\\") were great, but, they didn't have much dancing in them.  The dance numbers in this film are superb.  <br />Do yourself a favor .. catch \\"Chicago\\".  I'm going to be seeing it again!!

0142000663|5.0|At first when I started out, I wasn't too sure I would want to continue.  This book is written in local dialect which I thought would be tedious but I was in for a surprise for it was not.  After a while I began to love the dialect as much as I loved this book to tell the truth. No wonder John Steinbeck won the Pulitzer Prize in 1940 for this work.<br />The Grapes of Wrath centres on the Joads; a Dustbowl family from Oklahoma whose land was confiscated from them, along with others in the Midwestern states. All these families head for California where it is understood that there is lots of opportunity in that golden state to start again.  This being in immigrant work or farm labour in grape, pear and peach reaping.The trek is long but it's supposed to be well worth it with expectant good wages. and somewhere decent to live, somewhere to call home.<br />Meet the Joad family of Ma Joad; a good Christian woman and as the strength and spine of the family, she holds a tight reign on the entire bunch of them retaining their team spirit, and keeping the morale alive amongst them.  Then there is Casey  a sometimes preacher man; Tom Joad her eldest son  who is driven and afraid of nobody, but just anxious to get out to California to make some money; his brother Noah, a man consumed by quiet moments and little to say; Al the brother who drives the loaded down truck from Oklahoma, out to the West; Uncle John a restless soul, but who can blame him!  These along with Pa Joad, the Joad sister Rose of Sharon, and the young ones Ruthie and Winfield, they make up the exodus.  An exodus like none ever seen, we share in each heartache and disappointment as well as their hopefulness which Ma stokes daily.<br />As the Joad family turn from farmers in their own right to immigrant workers, it gets harder for the family to retain their dignity.  The reader will find himself living through these characters lives, and experiencing gratefulness for the little things which are so often taken for granted day in and day out.<br />I would love to encourage anyone interested in good literature, to get your hands on this powerful book soon. It certainly encouraged me to look at life differently.<br />Reviewed by Heather Marshall<br />January 10th, 2003or granted day in and day out.  <br />I would love to encourage anyone interested in good literature, to get your hands on this powerful book soon.

B00004WGAI|5.0|I agree that this version is the most true to the book.  My only problem is that I would like to purchase this film on DVD, not on VHS.  So where's the uncut DVD version?
0066214122|5.0|This book was one of the best he's ever written!!  It was really scary.  I love books about when science invents something and it goes horribly awry.  I wish that he had included dinosaurs in this book....but it was scary enough without dinosaurs, but it would have been ood.l.  I can't wait until his next book. I bought this one at the mall near my house and can't believe that it wasn't sold out!!!

0553801511|4.0|Robin Hobb's characterization and writing are excellent as usual in this second volume of the Tawny Man trilogy. However, the plot did not advance much. Not all series have to be in trilogy form! I had two specific quibbles, which I will describe, but try not to give away anything that would spoil people's enjoyment.<BR>First, I found it hard to believe that with all the spying and observation that goes on in this series, there was a failure of intelligence to locate a large one armed man and a war horse in a small town.<BR>Second, there was an instance in which Fitz went running to give away a secret told him by a friend. I found this to be very much out of character for him.

B00005NOOH|5.0|I remember first watching The World at War along with my father when I was about seven years old and I cannot overstate its impact upon me as a human being. Perhaps it's not surprising that since many of the images contained within these twenty-six episodes (French refugees fleeing their homes, the forceful separation of Russian peasant families, British civilians laying dead among the rubble of the Blitz, not to mention the nightmarish horrors of the extermination camps) have remained seared in my memory after all these years, this program has been pivital in forming my world view. Please forgive me if I rant a bit, but even as I write this review, similar unspeakable atrosities are being committed in third world countries around the globe while the nations of the free world remain as apathetic to the plight of thousands (just as they did in the early and mid 1930's) because those who suffer are considered insignificant or unworthy of concern.<br />Gripping and often rarely seen footage, an emotionally moving soundtrack and Laurence Olivier's astoundingly compelling narration combine to make Jeremy Issac's The World at War one of the most interesting and informative documentaries in television history. However, in my opinion, the addition of interviews with numerous participants from most of the engaged countries, many (if not all) of whom are now long deceased, are the best part of the film. For instance, I will always remember the German woman who, with heartbreakingly tearful regret, tells the story of when \\"...Hitler made me a murderer.\\" The viewer be warned. The horrors of the Second World War are neither sanitized, nor obscured in any of the episodes of The World at War and though some aspects of the conflict are missing due to the regretable constraints of time, the story of when nearly the entire world went to war is pointedly told from beginning to end with incisive integrity.
B000059XUI|3.0|I thought buying the DVD would give me some hidden suprises a better picture- something. It really doesn't and I was very unahppy with the DVD itself. Of course I am a superman fan, I kept the movie for my collections because Superman I &amp; II is about the best work from the 1970's.<br />Maybe my expectations were to high but sound wasn't too great and the picture not good quality. You may be better off buying the VHS and saving some money. I was so unhappy that I didn't even see if there were special features. I don't mean to sound totally negtaive, b/c I love superman. But that's about it.
B00006RU5B|5.0|If you were expecting Rage Against the Machine when you listen to this album, then you will be disappointed.  I am a huge fan of RAGE, but I knew that this group would sound nothing like RAGE because Cornell is a completely different element than De La Rocha.  This CD is by far the best I have heard in several years.  I cannot wait for their next CD to arrive, which probably will not be too long because they still have tons of stuff recorded.

B000065V41|3.0|&quot;Muppet Treasure Island&quot; and &quot;Muppet Christmas Carol&quot; are both good movies, but Disney came out with a bad DVD.  Both of the movies are in full screen format.  I think they should really have offered wide screen versions of the films.  The Special Features of Muppet Christmas Carol are: *Audio Commentary by Director Brian Henson.  *Frogs, Pigs, and Humbug: Unwrapping a new Holiday Class, which is a making of documantary.  *Christmas Around the World.  *On the Set which are the out takes from the movie.  *And animated menues.  <BR>  Over all, the special features are good, but i am not happy that it is only in full screen format.  If you are mad as well call Disney to get it changed at: 1-800-723-4763.
B00005JKNC|3.0|I liked this film.<br />Synopsis:<BR>Jim Carrey plays Peter Appleton, a Hollywood film writer who is accused of Communist affiliations.  He knows the accusation is going to ruin his career as a writer.  In coping with this realization he gets drunk, goes for a drive, gets in an accident, and hits his head.  The knock to the head results in temporary amnesia.  When he is found, he is taken to the town of Lawson, CA where it just so happens that the town has lost 50-60 young men in World War II and one of them, Luke Trimble, just happens to be a spitting image of Jim Carey's character.  The father of Luke Trimble, Harry Trimble (played by Martin Landau), happens to see Peter (though Peter has forgotten his name and his past life) and believes that his son whose body was never found in the war has returned home.  <br />Harry owns The Majestic, a now defunct movie theater that doubles as their home.  Well, Luke's return to Lawson creates something of an uproar as all of his old friends and his old flame, Adelle, played by Laurie Holden, all renew their relationships with him.  Luke helps get The Majestic running again only to have one of the movies that he wrote play in the theater.  When it does, his memory finally comes back.<br />What I haven't mentioned is the counter-plot that is running throughout the whole movie.  The Communist Activities Committee (that isn't the actual name, I forget it now) is trying to find Peter Appleton for being a Communist sympathizer.  Well, it just so happens that Harry dies the night that Luke/Peter realizes who he is.  The day they bury Harry is the day Peter reveals himself to Adelle and the Communist Activities Committee finally finds him.  When they find him it is a big social event and the entire town of Lawson is disillusioned by it.<br />Peter has to testify before the committee.  Adelle tries to convince him to deny the charges but when they separate Peter seems to be willing to read a statement saying he has severed his ties with the communists and then rat out several other Hollywood figures.  Well, Adelle gives him a gift as he leaves, a copy of the U.S. Constitution and a letter from Luke.  This affects Peter and he ends up denying the charges and facing down the committee.  When he faces down the committee he is raised back up to a hero in the eyes of Lawson and Adelle.  He ends up returning to Lawson, running The Majestic, and marrying Adelle. <br />My Comments:<BR>I liked the film because it had some memorable characters and made normal people the focus of the film rather than larger than life individuals.  The Usher for the Majestic, Emmitt Smith played by Gerry Black was one such character.  He was simple yet profound.  I like characters like that.  Also, Harry Trimble, played by Martin Landau, was also a simple and profound character.  <br />When the focus of the movie was on Lawson and the feelings of a town that has suffered so much, the movie made a great statement on the consequences of war and the importance of relationships in our lives.<br />When the movie switched back to the obvious political statement of Jim Carey's character before the investigating committee, the movie lost some of its glow.  Movies that have to tell you what they are trying to say often miss the point.  <br />Overall, the movie was fun to watch.  The tension that floated in the background from the individuals looking for Peter Appleton kept the movie moving even though it wasn't integrated as much as it could have been.

B00003CXFG|3.0|Before Vin Diesel got billed as the next action hero, he starred as a convicted murderer being transported on a ship through space.  Among other passengers on the ship are a tough captain (Radha Mitchell), a drug addicted cop (Dazed & Confused's Cole Hauser), and some other characters played by Keith David and Farscape's Claudia Black.  When the ship crashes on an uncharted planet, the surviving passengers are forced to band together to survive against the planet's indigenous vicious creatures.  The plot and storyline are far from original, but the excellent acting (including the surprisingly well acted role by Diesel) and superb directing from David Twohy (The Arrival) make Pitch Black a high grade B movie that is a great guilty pleasure.
6305807426|4.0|Excerpt from the Three Mothers:  \\"I Varelli, an architect living in London, met the Three Mothers and designed and built for them three dwelling places, one in Rome, one in New York, and the third in Freiborg, Germany.  I failed to discover until too late that from those three locations, the three mother ruled the world with sorrow, tears, and darkness.  Mater Suspiriorum, the mother or sighs and the oldest of the three, lives at Freiborg.  Mater Lachrymarum, the mother of tears and the most beautiful of the sisters, holds rule in Rome.  Mater Tenebrarum, the mother of darkness, who is the youngest and cruellest of the three, controls New York.  And I built their horrible houses, the repository of all their filthy secrets...\\"<br />That is what Rose Elliott, living in an apartment building in New York, discovers in an ancient book sold to her by Kazanian, an antiques dealer and later, as we learn, rabid ailurophobe--fear of cats.  She realizes that she lives in one of the three houses and sets out to unlock the riddle.  However, she is brutally killed, but not before sending a letter to her brother Mark, who is studying music in Rome.<br />Mark, distracted by a sultry woman with a huge dirty white Persian, forgets the letter at the music auditorium.  His classmate Sarah reads it, and calls Mark.  When he gets to her place, he finds her murdered.  He arrives in New York and gets mixed up in what his sister was investigating.<br />The scene preceding Rose's death is one of the eeriest, with windows lit hellish red, shimmering blue lights dancing along the walls, lightning, and glass breaking with the rain pouring in.  It climaxes with her gory demise.<br />Another is when Rose drops her keys in a pool and diving to get them, finds a weird room underwater.  Actress Irene Miracle clearly put her talents as an experienced underwater swimming to good use.<br />Two other characters meet with even worse deaths.  Elise, Rose's neighbour, has a, well, CAT-astrophic fate.  It's a highlight of this movie.  Cats feature a lot in this movie, BTW.  Ditto Kazanian, only worse, and with a different animal.  The casualty rate in this film is higher than in Argento's Profondo Rosso and Suspiria.<br />Although not mentioned, the girl with the cat was Mater Lachrymarum, and wordlessly played to perfection by Ania Pieroni.  Check the closeups of her blue eyes.  Two alumni from Profondo Rosso appear:  Gabriele Lavia and Daria Niccolodi.  As in Rosso, Lavia plays a character named, yes, Carlo.  Daria Niccolodi (Elise) was Gianna in PR and was the ex-wife of Dario Argento and mother of Asia Argento.  Alida Valli (the desk woman) came out in Suspiria as the menacing Miss Tanner.<br />One superlative visual effect was done by Mario Bava, and that was the transformation scene of Mater Tenebrarum.  Not bad for a period without digital graphics technology.<br />Keith Emerson's (of Emerson-Lake-Palmer) piano score captures the eerie atmosphere of this film, as does his Latin choir in the Mater Tenebrarum song near the film's end and credits.<br />The second in Dario Argento's as-yet uncompleted Three Mothers trilogy, while not as visually grabbing as Suspiria, still maintains horrific deaths and images, lots of blood, whispering voices, and menacing hands.  And Leigh McCloskey (Mark) comes across as unassertive and undynamic.  Still, a laudable effort from Argento.a highlight of this movie.  Cats feature a lot in this movie, BTW.

B000002J1F|5.0|Why buy the Album?<br />The reviewers below really hit it dead on:  this is not Yes' most cohesive or best album, but it still is one of the essential albums in any rock collection.  Every member of Yes is incredibly talented:  Jon Anderson's raspy voice sounds like two people singing at the same time; Chris Squire plays bass as if it was a lead instrument; Steve Howe's guitar at times rings with classical underpinnings and at other times rips out overwhelming lightning fast rock riffs; Wakeman's only peer on keyboards is Keith Emerson; and I suspect Bill Bruford is one of the few drummers who could possibly anchor this much talent.<br />Without reviewing the songs individually, the music is some of the most complex to be produced by a mainstream rock band with extended instrumental passages which paint great musical landscapes.  The lyrics are pure poetry, the meaning of which is not always ascertainable.  In a way this enhances the band in that it allows Jon Anderson's voice to be a musical instrument communicating pure emotion without the necessity of resorting to the meaning of the words he is voicing.<br />Amazingly, 30 years after this album was released, YES! can still fill the the 2500 seat Universal Amputheater in Los Angeles, with seats going for an average of $... a pop.  That says a lot for the quality of the musicians and their compositions.  And that is why this album is essential to a music collection.<br />Why buy the DVD-Audio?<br />CDs are harsh and brittle.  They produce listening fatigue in minutes, and have always left me fiddling with the trebble in a feeble attempt correct the uncorrectable sound.  Nothing worked.  So, for serious music appreciation, I needed to resort to the long playing vinyl album.  These have their own problems such as limited dynamic range, transient distortion, poor pressing quality, tape hiss and noise, scratches and thousands of pops and ticks, rumble, wow and flutter, and expensive playback equipment which needed careand tuning.  And worst of all, I had to get up to flip the album half-way through!<br />DVD-Audio and SACDs fix these problems.  Initially, I put on the CD of Yes' \\"Close to the Edge\\" just to assure myself that CDs aren't for extended listening.  I then played the DVD-A and the vinyl of Fragile at the same time and flipped back and forth.  The stereo track on the DVD-A revealed instruments which were burried on the vinyl:  Steve Howe's guitar has a beautiful warmth to it which is missing on the vinyl -- the ring and sustain of the guitar notes at the beginning of Roundabout held on longer; the echo from the room in which Anderson was singing became more apparent; Wakeman's synthesizers sounded crystaline without harshness; and you could hear with clarity the wood of Bruford's sticks as they hit the rim of a drum.  The 5.1 track reveals even more, most notably in \\"Cans and Brahms\\" when Wakeman hits a deep bass organ peddle and the room vibrates.<br />A must have album.  If you have a DVD player, I also recommend Yes Live at the House of Blues and Keys to Ascension.

With songs such as \\"Alone Together\\" it is quite certain The Strokes will be here for awhile. With a sound that is timeless, it is good to know that someone today is interested in good rock music and not just pointless pop music that is overunning the charts. The Strokes and the rest of the neo garage genre (The Vines, White Stripes, The Hives,etc) are making music with a purpose.

Their worst album to date. I love  classic albums like \\"seventh son of a senventh son\\" , \\"power slave\\", \\"Killers\\" , \\" number of the beast\\",  and my all time most cherish and proud albums of all  \\"somewhere in time\\"... All the albums i named are classics,  and made me proud to be an fan but \\"fear of the dark\\" is very disapointing. I have to admit that,  it made me fallsleep while listining to this ... album. Iron maiden is an awsome band, with songs that no other band can outdo todate. Their far  from bands like guns and roses,metallica, slayer and s.o.d.,  iron maiden is the best one out of all  of them  ...  I realy do love iron maiden alot but this album is just  plain garbage and if  you been an maiden fan you will agree. Don't purchase this piece of ... !

B000066NW0|4.0|Times don't really change all that much. Nor do people. It's just the alliegances that change, or rather, differ from society to society. In America nowadays, the only way to differentiate yourself from anyone else is to cling on to a collective definition of particular music types, it seems, and blast a verbal hole in the head of anyone who crosses those lines of definition. Then we laugh at the rest of the world for clinging to what they consider important (and what arguably IS more important) in their respective societies. Perhaps we should just have some good old fashioned coats-of-arms declaring PUNK &amp; EMO &amp; POP &amp; COUNTRY &amp; RAP, etc, and shun others who don't follow our most beloved of personal choices. I'm rambling now, so in conclusion: Avril herself is really cute. She's already mastered the whole &quot;I'm not cute, shucks, stop saying I'm cute! *giggle*&quot; act, but I'd still blush and stammer upon meeting her; who wouldn't?

0790742780|5.0|To hell with what movie critics said about this film, it rocks!  I loved every minute of it.  The acting was superb, the story great, and even though i doubt the creators intended it, it is funny as heck!
0345448898|3.0|Pullman's trilogy is beautiful, immensely imaginative, and profoundly disappointing.  The first two books are wonderful works of fantasy fiction that adults and young people alike can easily enjoy.  On that basis alone, I recommend reading it.  Unfortunately, the last book winds up being a dogmatic condemnation of religion, the organized church, and the idea of a loving, wise, or powerful God.  For someone from a European society, with a closer connection to the history of a single and too-frequently abusive church authority (in Pullman's work, the \\"Authority\\" obviously stands for the Catholic church), this work may be more acceptable and understandable, but for American readers growing up in a more pluralistic society with greater respect for (and less arrogance about) other people's beliefs, Pullman's ultimate thrust is as dogmatic and insulting as the church he fantastically creates and criticizes.  The religious figures in this book are mean, distorted characters, fanatics who only want to control or, failing that, exterminate their foes.  For people wise enough to recognize they have no singular purchase on the ultimate truth, Pullman's attempted rendering of a more sophisticated, adult truth in which there is no real God comes across as an ugly and uneducated piece of propaganda.  It's unfortunate that an otherwise spectacular story could get bogged down in such inappropriate sermonizing.  If you like science fiction or fantasy and couldn't care less about religious and spiritual matters, you might love this trilogy.  If you have any respect for Christianity or other religious traditions, you may find this work disturbing, despite its beauty and inventiveness.
B000001Y2U|3.0|I haven't listened to this album in particular in its entirety. My brother is a fan of Marilyn Manson and he likes to download his music, which I listen to occassionally. Don't get me wrong, I'm not a fan of Marilyn Manson, but I am going to speak out against those who underestimate him. Marilyn Manson, as far as I can tell at least, is using shock to his advantage. That's not a problem, so did Alice Cooper (the original King of Shock Rock.) There's no problem with that, as he is a satanist and according to that particular religion the use of shock or some other such tactic is very useful and not in the least bit demeaning (after all, using beauty to get sex, or using advertizements to get customers is the same thing.) Secondly, although he seems to take it a bit more seriously than Alice Cooper, he is essentially doing the same thing by becoming a stage character named Marilyn Manson that is nasty, violent and sexually ambiguous. That's not such a bad thing, now is it?  Just because he focuses on the negative things in life with his music doesn't make him a negative person, the character \\"Marilyn Manson\\" is the negative aspect of his personality, not  the whole. I have no intention of bottling up the entirety of Marilyn Manson in this one review, but this is the way I see him and I just want you naysayers to get another POV.
B00006SFLV|5.0|I dont have the dvd set, but I have all the episodes that I taped myself from the mtv reruns of this classic show.  This series was nothing short of a masterpiece.  Pick it up, it's well worth it.
B00005YW4H|5.0|I love Norah Jones' CD &quot;Come Away With Me&quot;.  There is not a single track I don't like on this CD.  It is definately worth buying, with its calming and light sound.  As a teenager, I enjoy the work of Norah Jones because she is a refreshing break from the highly-produced pop singers that are topping the charts right now.
B00005UW7G|5.0|I have not seen this DVD yet, and I will revise this review when I have. However, it is worthy of note that Fred Plotkin, former performance manager of the Metropolitan Opera and author of one of the best guide-books to the appreciation of opera, Opera 101 (Hyperion, 1994), made the statement quoted in my title, referring both the movie and to the CD of its soundtrack. <br />Regarding Raimondi's performance in the title role, Plotkin says \\"His Don Giovanni is elegant, aristocratic, seductive, cynical, dangerous, and always very musical. With his superior diction in his native Italian he caresses, growls, barks, and sweetens words to make each one meaningful\\" (p. 260). Among the star-studded cast, which includes Kiri te Kanawa \\"in one of her finest roles,\\" he finds only one weak link -- Kenneth Riegel as Don Ottavio, who \\"does not capture the sweet lyricism of Ottavio's music,\\" especially in his two \\"meltingly beautiful\\" arias. <br />The Karajan DVD of this opera, while a superb performance featuring Samuel Ramey as the Don, is flawed by poor video quality and a mediocre Zerlina. The ArtHaus DVD, a 1991 performance by the Gurzenich Orchester Cologne and the Cologne City Opera, is very good, though Thomas Allen as the Don does not compare to Ramey and the disk is flawed by a poorly done descent-into-hell scene. And only this Paris Opera movie version, released on DVD in 2002, comes in wide screen format. All things considered, it might be the version to acquire first, though every opera lover should have at least one video of a stage version as well. <br />And do have a look at Plotkin's book if you want an informed and systematic course of initiation into the glorious world of opera. After a fascinating introduction to the history of opera and its terminology and singer types, Plotkin takes us on an intriguing journey of discovery starting from Rigoletto, and proceeding through Tosca, Lucia Di Lammermoor, and Il Barbiere Di Siviglia. Then we are ready for Don Giovanni, for which he uses this movie version. <br />After we have throughly savored this opera in its many dimensions, Plotkin deems us ready to go on to even more complex genres and more \\"advanced\\" levels of connoisseurship with Les Contes D'Hoffman, Eugene Onegin, Don Carlo, Tannhauser, Die Walkure, and Elektra. <br />I am still only about half way through the journey myself, and I haven't followed the course very systematically, getting intoxicated by Wagner when I had just begun to explore most of the earlier operas in Plotkin's course of study. Fortunately, it now behooves me to take several steps backwards in Plotkin's course and do a thorough study of Tosca for an up-coming performance in August.<br />Fortunately, I have also been asked to learn a duet from this \\"most exalted of all operas,\\" Mozart's masterpiece, so I will have use for another different version of the opera in my study. I am greatly looking forward to my first viewing, particularly since its conductor, Lorin Maazel, just put himself on my list of favorite musicians through his beautiful collaboration with Andrea Bocelli on the album Sentimento.

B00005M6AP|5.0|Know what? This simply shows how the legendary band still can rock hard. Even though they are at their late 40s and 50s they can still create the unique Scorpions amazing moments, also this shows that the Scorpions love to play live. Their live recordings are almost as great as their studio recordings.... the changed version of Holiday is as amazing as the original one... and the Queen's Love Of My Life has never sounded better. Klaus Meine's vocal is the key part in this acoustic album.
B00006RU5B|4.0|Much of this album sounds like the old Grunge rock of the early 1990s. I suppose Chris Cornell wrote most of the songs to sound like the vintage Soundgarden sound, but the music has a bit of an updated feel and vibe thanks to the playing of the old Rage Against the Machine members. Overall, the songs are very smooth and flow nicely, the lyrics are good and the guitar has a bit of an older, more down to earth rock feel to it than some of the records by either old band. This fusion didn't seem to make much sense when Chris Cornell got together with the Rage guys in 2001, but the music they have produced is definately a winner.
B000001Y2U|4.0|This album is awsome! But there are  a few songs that really suck like 6,11,14,7,8 (ok but still),3, and few others but songs like 10,12,13,1,2,5 (ok), 15 (ok), are awsome. If your gonna buy this new its worth it. Just stay away from smells like children.
B000002BYD|5.0|I'm sorry to do this but I had to give &quot;Do the Evolution&quot; gratification somehow.  It is one of the greatest songs I have ever heard.  And then, on top of that, there's the AMAZING video.  Every time a hear and see that song (because the video is part of the song) I experience more emotions than I thought possible.  I feel sad, lost, ashamed, pitiful, hateful, afraid, and much more.  Mainly the best part of the song is the vocals.  Eddie's screams seem very controlled and intentional.  It's almost as though he is playing his voice like a musical intrument.  Now I don't know if the song really ranks musically, but the whole point of music is to evoke thought and emotion, right?  It sure as hell does that.  Every single human being should see this video and hear this song.  It's time we opened our eyes to what's going on.  What have we become?
B00005JL78|4.0|Another great movie from Steven Spielberg - this time a sci-fi that talks about precrime.<br />Imagine a world that has no crime. Before a crime occurs, special cops are there to catch you and thus no crime for  6 years. Wow! How would be a world without crime and war? It is a fantasy only I guess. The subject of the movie is a very interesting topic and the movie goes well until it falls into the usual formula of setting up and the plot. The screenplay is awful that we feel boring many a time during the movie. Looks like Spielberg did not bother about it instead concentrated on the special effects. Besides this there are lot of loopholes in the movies that questions the logic. We cannot leave them aside as this is not a James Bond movie - this is Spielberg's. <br />But what holds the audience is the extravaganza of what all typically we can expect in another 50 years - Transparent Monitors, Keyboard-less Mouse-less Browsing, Electronic Newspapers, Rounded Cars, Security Check through Retina Scan, Flying humanbeings,  Artificial Spiders that do the security job, Customized shopping experience... all we could expect over time. A special applause to Steven Spielberg. Only he could do it. Unlike other sci-fi movies that tell about unrealistic and unimaginable, Spieldberg talks about a realistic future.<br />Adding to the above are the excellent photography and background music and the dialog &quot;Everybody runs&quot; - class apart. On a whole the movie is enjoyable if you forgive certain aspects. Nothing notable to comment about Tom Cruise' performance.
B00005JLSC|5.0|I was totally blown away by CHICAGO.  At first, I was expecting to see a movie that was all hype and no talent.  I was *so* wrong to underestimate this film.  I haven't seen a movie this good in YEARS.  Everyone sang and danced very well, which was a very pleasant surprise, compared to all the hype surrounding Nicole Kidman because she sang in Moulin Rouge.  (Pity she didn't sing very well, compared to the people in CHICAGO.)  Anyway...this is a film that can't afford to be overlooked.  Why?  Because this movie is really something special.  You're really going to be in for a treat if you go see this movie.
0553382179|5.0|I am an executive assistant for a very busy (and previously very unorganized) CEO.  As such, my work life is impeccably \\"together\\" and full of systems and lists.  For some reason, though, I never thought to apply the same theories to my home.  The FlyLady's ideas are not necessarily anything new, but they have revolutionized my home -- I've been using her system for a week, and am much less stressed and much more clean and organized for it!!!  Best of all, my husband helps more around the house, because he doesn't need to ask what needs to be done -- he just goes to the \\"control binder\\" to check the list for that week's zone!!!!!

0142000655|5.0|\\"East of Eden\\", although a bit long, is a truely worthwhile read.  John Steinbeck paints a magnificent portrait of the Salinas Valley, his hometown, and encompasses The Hamilton family and the Trasks in a unique fashion.  Though spanning several generations and jumping around a bit, Mr. Steinbeck composes a compelling epic tale which revolves around the fall of Adam and Eve, and the famous rivalry betwixt Cain and Abel.  <br />Steinbeck sections the novel into four parts.  The theme of Part I [impulses] leads directly into what man desires most in life [glory], the theme of Part II.  The greatest glory man can achieve for himself and for God, is to overcome sin through being gven a choice (which is discussed in reference to the Cain and Abel aspect).  The theme of Part III is the choice that God gave to Cain [timshel] which means \\"thou mayest\\"...indicating that although he has sinned, he will overcome in the end.  The theme of Part IV ties in all of the prior focuses: Man is likely to fall into sin as a result of the 'rejection cycle'.  [Desire to achieve Glory] - [Rejection] - [Anger] - [Crime] - [Guilt].  Steinbeck's characters discuss this idea, and if applied to almost any character in the novel, one is able to see how the cycle works in each life.  <br />The Elia Kazan-directed film starring James Dean is very well made, however in correlation to the novel itself, does not do it justice as it only covers Part IV.  The fact is that you simply cannot cover the time and experiences of a 600+ page novel in a concise manner.  To capture the true essence of Steinbeck's message. Don't be intimidated by the size...once you pick it up, you will find that the intimate relationship you develop with the characters forbids you to lay it down.
B000005JA8|1.0|This album should never have been made.  I bought it on the recommendation of a co-worker, but I was left almost angry after poisoning my ears with this tripe.  I was warned that I wouldn't like it the first time I listened to it, but this exceeded all expectations.  I'll not be bothering with this again any time soon.
0151008116|5.0|I read Life of Pi over a month ago, and I still can't get it out of my head.  I've been reading a lot of novels over the last year, and this book was enjoyable - until I got to the last 40 pages or so.  Then - wow!<br />I'd never want to spoil the sense of exploration that readers have - especially in this book.  Let's just say this:  I can hardly wait to get this book back from a friend so that I can reread it.  And I don't reread books.<br />Buy it, read it, share it!
0446605409|5.0|At my age, most books help me get to sleep.  But when I read this book, I was riveted.  The historical local details DeMille gives and his sarcastic wit are two of the reasons I'm going back for more DeMille.  This story is even more relevant in light of the current events at Plum Island.
0002005549|4.0|This book was a great read, fast paced and interesting. I've come to love Michael Crichton's books and this one it a keeper. Filled with action, awe-inspiring technology and suspense, this was an very interesting read.  I did however, find that it didn't carry the weight that TIMELINE did, seemed to be &quot;too fast&quot; in some sections, and the technology explanation was a bit rushed not as detailed as TIMELINE or SPHERE. But over all, the book was awesome (AAA)! Buy it!
B00006LI4S|5.0|Being the world's number one David Gilmour fan, my only complaint about this DVD was there wasn't enough on it! The price of this DVD is more than worth it just to hear him sing a Shakespearean sonnet...and show off a bit of his French as well.  Although the years are showing, I think he might have ONE MORE PINK FLOYD TOUR in him...I hope!  Great DVD, his version of Elvis' \\"Don't\\" is spectacular!
6305531374|3.0|This one besides the first two is the best of them all. Not because of the story or acting, because of how scary it is and how great the ending is. This one is well worth buying, The story takes place in California at a school where Jaime lee curtis is the head mistress. She faked her death to get away from her brother Michael and now has a 17 year old son named John. But somehow Michael finds away to get to her and starts trying to kill John. Laurie now knows to face her brother in this one.This one is truly a thrill ride from start to finish with a great ending.
B00005JLSC|5.0|Wow! I was so surprised when I saw this movie. I've never been into musicals, especially after seeing Moulin Rouge. Basically, I went to this movie because I'm a Richard Gere fan. I didn't really have high hopes. But my outlook on this movie definitely changed. I loved every single minute of it! The cast was incredible, the songs were catchy, everything was great. I've already seen it twice and will probably end up seeing it again. When you watch this movie you will be smiling the whole time. I looked around the movie theatre as Catherine Zeta-Jones and Renee Zellweger were performing on the screen and everyone watching had a huge grin on their face. If you see this film you will know what I mean! Give it a chance, even if you're not a big musical fan. You won't regret it.
6305137293|3.0|The sequel to the high anticipated Halloween. I have to admit this was a pretty good sequel on accounting most sequels are bad. This movie was flawed but it was enjoyable to watch. The story for H2 was simple Michael is still alive and he travels to a hospital Laurie Strode is staying well that cant be good can it? This one continues of from the first one when Michael falls off a balcony from six shots by Dr. Loomis. I enjoyed this film a plethora amount. I think this one like Halloween was scary and thrilling. This is what you actually call a Thrill Ride. This one is worth buying not unlike Halloween Ressurection. This one is close to the best of them all.
B00006CXSS|1.0|How you seen how clean the uniforms of the soldiers were in the entire series. I think that this miniseries poorly portray the image Stephen Ambrose book &quot;Band of Brothers&quot; wants us to have.If you want to watch how real soldiers fight in the war you should watch &quot;The War at World&quot; series.
6305971099|2.0|What happened? This film saga was good until this one came out. I admit it was decent, but thats no excuse for bad acting, bad storyline, and no jump or frightening scenes at all. The story is boring in a way. Michael returns after jaime when shes in a mental asylum. This film was poorly made and poorly written, and the characters are so bad you dont care if they die. This is by far the worst in the series. I only liked it because of some deaths were cool. But this is my own opinion and i still think its worth to rent.
0060989157|5.0|I loved this book.  I can't get it off of my mind like seeing a bad accident.  I read this 6 months ago and am ready to read it again to be sure I got it right.  What filth, what insight on the world of a rock and rollers.  I think there should be some kind of college course reviewing this book as you could discuss for hours how rockers are rewarded for behaving badly and seem to just exist to party and not take part in bathing, laundry, sleeping with sheets on a bed etc. The whole groupie mindset is frightening and makes me happy to only have given birth to sons. I felt like I had spent a month with them on a show like Survivor and knew them deeply.  Can't explain my fascination with the book as I am not a fan and am a 42 year old housewife but just could not put the book down.  Run, don't walk and read a treat of a book.  I can't imagine anyone not enjoying jumping head first into this motley mess.  The Ozzie references are priceless.  This would make a good movie.
6305546789|4.0|I have seen many slasher movies in my time and Halloween is by far one of the best out of all of them. I would compare this movie to Psycho (1960) Which is another classic in horror. By my opinion from 1970-1990 was the best horror movie era. As if no one knows the storyline this movie takes place in Haddonfield,Illinois when a little boy name Michael Myers kills his sister on Halloween night. Almost over 20 years later Michael escapes from a mental asylum and returns to his home where it is being accompanied by Jamie Lee Curtis when Dr.Loomis played by Donald Pleasence attempts to kill Michael. In all this is a great film to watch in the dark. Its well worth the money.
B00005QIPH|5.0|When you first listen, the guitar sonics scream Television and Julian Casablancas (vocalist) sounds like Lou Reed. Soon after the Strokes become their own with the urgency and hooks only the best rock bands find. Many listens later (four times one day), &quot;Is this it?&quot; stands as an important statement to compelling attitude and creativity among today's abundance of created music.  It's energy doesn't wear off and Casablancas' unique vocal phrasings leave you wondering if the Strokes aren't the best band since Nirvana.
B00005JKZT|5.0|I had missed the opportunity to see part one of this trilogy in the theaters, although I am VERY happy and pleased with the new 4-DVD Special Extended Edition version of THE LORD OF THE RINGS: FELLOWSHIP OF THE RING. I told myself I WOULD, God willing, see this movie in theaters and boy am I glad I did.<br />Here then, is THE LORD OF THE RINGS: THE TWO TOWERS as brought to the screen by Peter Jackson, Phillippa Boyens, Fran Walsh, Howard Shore, and their crew of merry troubadours. There is no break in action from the first film to the second.  This picks right up where THE FELLOWSHIP OF THE RING left off. Upon seeing the opening grand vistas of the mountains of New Zealand and revisting Gandalf's last-stand battle with the infamous Balrog, I knew I was in for a treat, one that kept me glued to my seat for the full three hours of this movie. Those three hours seemed to just fly by and not once was I bored with the film.<br />Granted: The visuals for this film are stunning, no matter what they depict. The music, once again supplied by Howard Shore, dances expertly being noble, exciting, chilling and tender without missing a beat. I loved the use of choir in this work, and especially the Norwgian fiddle used in the theme for the people of Rohan. All the music for me, however was absolutely first rate and further added to the supsense and beauty and high adventure of the film.<br />Granted: The parts of Gandalf and Saruman, respectively, in this movie are small. However, both Sir Ian McKellan (Gandalf The White) and the incomparable Christopher Lee (Saruman The White) manage to give to their scenes an undeniable air of power, nobility, and in their respective cases, tenderness (for Gandalf) and menace (for Saruman). Also, though her role as Arwen is small here, Liv Tyler, to me, shines in it. I LOVED the scenes between both her and Aragorn (Viggo Mortensen) and her and Elrond (Hugo Weaving) In both cases Arwen's scenes were tender and provided a real emotional impact. Ifelt the weight of her choice as she struggled yet more with the decision between a mortal life with the love of Aragorn versus the immortal life of an elfin princess. I felt for the plight of the Elves as they further progressed towards their final departure from the world of Middle Earth.<br />All of the acting here in my view was wonderful. Viggo Mortensen shines as the heroic and noble Aragorn. Elijah Wood and Sean Astin are a pair you can really relate to as the stalwart little Hobbit Frodo Baggins and his trusty sidekick Samwise Gamgee. Brad Dourif made my skin crawl as the dastardly Grima Wormtongue. Bernard Hill came across as a tough but tender father figure of sorts as Theoden, King of Rohan (the scene where he mourns the death of his son had my own eyes burning with tears). Miranda Otto was apprropriately  stately and regal as Eowyn, who proved she was no mere damsel in distress, but could handle herself quite well. Making a welcome return as Gimli, son of Gloin, John Rhys-Davies strikes the perfect balance between comedic and tough-as-nails. Orlando Bloom (Legolas) and Cate Blanchett (Galadriel) were also a joy to behold again. Everybody did a great job.<br />Special kudos must be given to Andy Serkis (The voice of Gollum/Smeagol) I really sympathized as he watched the unfolding of the sad life of the little creature so horribly twisted by the dark powers of Sauron's One Ring of Power. Andy Serkis really pulled off the role of a poor little creature driven to utter madness and forced by this to be thought of as a monster by virtually ever other inhabitant of Middle Earth.<br />I found the love triangle worked well. Arwen's time with Aragorn was passionate but done with extreme taste. Likewise, Eowyn's affection and love were obvious, without her throwing herself at Aragorn, AND Aragorn's fidelity to Arwen despite Eowyn's attention was very touching to me<br />The Battle Of Helms Deep AND the complete and utter TRASHING of Isengard by the Ents (with SOMEhelp from Merry and Pippin) were sequences that both amused, impressed and kept my attention riveted to the full. (I loved seeing Saruman's fortress getting its proverbial buttocks kicked) and the Helm's Deep battle was engaging in the best sense of the word. The Nazgul (the ring-wraiths)  were as chilling as ever, even though their appearance was brief. It was made all the more chilling because the fact that they rode on the backs of winged creatures means that water is no longer a barrier(as it sometimes was when they rode the black horses) and that they could travel greater distances muc faster than before. Treebeard and the Ents looked convincingly real, and John-Rhys-Davies vocals for Treebeard gave that character a gruff nobility that on the whole was entirely appropriate for that character.<br />In short, this movie is no less than the continuation of a trilogy that is a cinematic masterpiece. In terms of visuals, music, acting, pace and sheer entertainment, it left me breathless and makes the wait for THE LORD OF THE RINGS: THE RETURN OF THE KING even more taxing and agonizing. I say, bring it on. This was a great film, and I for one am very eager and happy to see how the final chapter of this awesom movie trilogy plays itself out. When it is done, I am totally convinced that we will have one of the greatest movie trilogies of all time on our hands. Go. See it. Enjoy it. It's an easy film to enjoy, and even an easy film to love, if you have the courage to let your heart be touched and your imagination carried away to the awesome cinematic world that is Middle Earth, brought expertly from page to screen by a crew that knows and obviously loves what they're doing. Peace, and God bless you and yours, always.
0316666343|1.0|Seldom do I agree with a New York Review of Books in so many particulars as I did concerning The Lovely Bones. The author begins with an interesting premise, but the execution is anything but satisfying. It's all spun sugar; it lacks substance.<br /><br />Susie's heaven has precedence in certain Theosophical and spiritualist accounts which describe the afterlife in terms of a myriad of subjective environments. Each soul goes to the one it is most comfortable with. One may ask for or create new elements (e.g., an addition to one's home) therein, and may move from one to another as one feels ready or becomes curious. Unfortunately, this was the only interesting element in the book.<br /><br />Far from handling the gruesome realities of life as Ms. Sebold has claimed was her goal, the story quickly degenerates into a lot of drivel about relationships. It is something like what the less sentimental of both sexes refer to as a chick movie; it isn't even a good one, since a true production of that genre at least attempts to make the audience sympathise deeply with the characters in their situations. Sebold tends to describe emotions in such a way as to make us feel no immediacy, no genuine tugs at the heartstrings whatsoever.<br /><br />I wonder was this book seized upon because of its portrayal of Susie in her afterlife? It certainly wasn't due to Sebold's lackluster depiction of Susie's killer and the hunt for same. I essentially read this book through hoping to find out how they would catch him, and was disappointed even in that.<br /><br />Worst of all, toward the end of the book, Sebold begins to cheat. She's established that people in Heaven may observe earthly affairs, but are unable to intervene; now, she breaks that rule. Susie is allowed to return to earth via semi-voluntary possession of a friend -- I read the reason as that she'd never had an orgasm and felt she'd missed out on a fundamental experience of life. Surely there are equivalent states of rapture in Paradise? The rule is broken again a few pages later, causing a conclusion even less satisfying than it was already.<br /><br />I prefer Capra's ungainly, nightshirted second-class guardian angel to the fare proffered us by Sebold. Capra let us feel that ghastly tragedy full force, the angel's intervention lets us see how much worse it could have been, and while the ending is not entirely realistic (particularly from a legal standpoint) it contains a fulfillment that Sebold's little ditty lacks.gain a few pages later, causing a conclusion even less satisfying than it was already.

And I sat down and listened to the whole thing all the way through. I had to say that I was pretty impressed. Her singing was beautiful, and just a breath of fresh air next to all the other &quot;pop divas&quot;. And she's not so much jazz as she is pop. But, I am a male, and she is rather attractive. And for a while I couldn't be very critical of her music because I was semi-in-love with her(by the way, I love every interview with her that I've read... she's just a cool chick). But I've come to the conclusion that her music is good for a first album. I'm sure she has the potential to do a lot more musically because she really is a jazz pianist, but you don't hear much of it on Come Away With Me. If she makes another album that sounds just like the first, I think we can dismiss about 75% of the hype around her. I mean, people who like pop music may like this. People who expect it to be jazz will be disappointed. I still listen to it occasionally. It's a nice &quot;before bed&quot; album. Norah Jones deserves moderate attention but she's got to establish herself more. I have high hopes for her second album. I'm expecting hardcore bop, yeah! ;)
B000066NW0|5.0|hello people!<br />This is album is great. I don't get why all the reviews are negative?<br />All the songs are catchy and she writes them herself. Sure she sounds a little like Alanis at time, but who cares? Thats a good thing.<br />Go out and buy it!<br />Best tracks are Anything But Ordinary, I'm With You, Get Over It, and Tomorrow.
B00005RHGL|3.0|I won't wax eloquent about the film itself. Suffice it to say that I enjoyed this movie enough to purchase it's first release on widescreen DVD in 1996, and was very much looking forward to this new Vista Series release. I suppose the commentary and documentary could justify the additional expense I put out for the Vista Series, but I am going to take this opportunity to elucidate some negative aspects of the new release. Since this new transfer is THX certified, I was expecting a very pristine presentation compared to the 1996 DVD release. My main complaint of the new transfer is that it's black level is set waaay too low. You will find yourself cranking up the brightness to see any shadow detail at all, and even then you can't dial it in just right. On the positive side, the color is much, much nicer on the new transfer, and the sharpness is a tad more detailed also. Just a few comments now on some of the \\"extras\\". The extra 4 minutes of added footage does nicely fill some gaps in the original version, and certainly does not ruin the experience, as one very opinionated viewer noted below. The commentary by George Cosmatos is entertaining and quite informative, even more so than the three-part \\"Making of\\" documentary. The \\"Tombstone Epitaph\\" looked very nice, until I actually tried to read it. One reviewer noted that the print was too small to see. I suppose that determination hinges on the size of one's screen and the quality of one's eyesight. All I can add to his comment is that on my 32\\" monitor the Epitaph print was clearly legible, albeit small. But my one reservation about the Epitaph hinges about how one must navigate to read the print. Imagine that a big picture was taken of the paper, and your screen zooms in on just a portion of it. To navigate up, down, left and right to see the whole thing, you use the arrow keys on the remote. Problem is, some of the columns in the newspaper are divided down the middle by the edge of the screen. So, you can read the left half of each column, or the right half. But to read each line you must constantly be pushing the arrow keys left, right, left, right endlessly. Ridiculous, and I gave up. They should have made one column of the paper fill up one screen's width. Also included as an extra is a map of the beginning of the gunfight at the O.K. corral as penned by Wyatt Earp in 1919. This is printed on very nice looking paper, but all of the small handwriting is illegible as presented. Nice thought, though. It is hard to believe that a Director's Cut Special Edition of a film does not include any cast bio's or filmographies. Sad. Finally, the new packaging is quite slick looking, with both the cover art and internal art having a very nice rustic look to it. Quite classy. The only reservation I have is of the durability of the package. I have not experienced good longevity of this type of packaging, with the plastic DVD trays hot-glued to a paper or plastic backing. They always seem to come unglued eventually with heavy use. Just thought I would cut through the hype and offer some meat-and-potatoes info on this new Vista release.
B0000065O1|4.0|Getting this video used for a buck was the best deal I have found all year.  Cindy begins with a good warm up and stretch section.  The aerobic series follows.  I am not a fan of elaborate aerobics, so I was happy with the basics that are really worked: lunges, squats, kicks and jumps.  Three ab segments are spread out across the workout: you will feel the burn.  I think there is a total of about 160-200 reps.  The stregnth training is very thorough: lots of chest excercises are something kind of different, rows and curls are plentiful.  All of this takes place with beautiul backgrounds and ethereal music.  Cindy is sweet and inspirational, but as another reviewer pointed out, not even supermodels have perfect bodies.  Working out is fun!
B00005JLRR|3.0|WHAT I LIKED: <br />1)The interaction between the characters was first-rate. Character interaction has always been a hallmark of the Star Trek franchise. While Insurrection lacked it, Nemesis made up for it. Well done.<BR>2)Characterization. Happily, Troi seemed like Troi, Riker seemed like Riker. Many of us have been following these characters for years. When we tune in, we want to see these characters, not reasonable fascimiles.<BR>3)The action sequences were outstanding.<BR>4)Tom Hardy worked as a young Picard.<br />WHAT BOTHERED ME:<br />1)This was hailed as the beginning of a new generation. All right? Where was it? From what I've heard, we were supposed to get a new First Officer. Where was he? It would have been nice to have seen him. Also, Dr. Crusher was supposed to have left the ship at the end of the film. Did I blink? Without these elements in place, it didn't seem like the beginning of a new generation.<BR>2)The movie seemed to end suddenly. It didn't seem done. One minute we're mourning a crewmember, the next we're all smiling again. <BR>3)There were apparently scads of missing scenes. Wesley Crusher was at the wedding, but he had no lines. What was the point? If he did film a scene with...you know...lines, it would have been appropriate to include it.<BR>4)What was Worf doing on Enterprise? At the end if DS9, he was supposed to have left Starfleet. Don't get me wrong, I like him, but I don't appreciate unexplained slips in continuity. <BR>5) Some time ago, the Enterprise discovered a prototype of Data---Lore. He turned out to be rather---loony. Yet nobody mentioned this when Enterpise discovered B4. Instead, they slapped B4 together, plugged him in, and then gave him Data's memories. You would think someone would have said \\"Remember Data's other brother?\\" <br />All in all, it was a good movie. But not great. If they hadn't cut some of the scenes they cut, and if they had not left so many holes in continuity, it would have been brilliant. By the way, the missing scenes (the new First Officer, Crusher's goodbye) are in the book version.
B00005221M|4.0|One of the best movies of the 90's - the DVD removes the only drawback to the movie - - which were Hawkeye's 20th century wisecracks which seemed completely out of context and character. It was if Rambo suddenly took over Daniel Day Lewis' mouth for the moment;  for others - and i know you are out there, who also were bothered by this, rest assured that they are removed.<br />Also - Clannad's insipid &quot;I will find you&quot; is also removed, as it was also a bit overdramatic.  I am a Clannad fan, but I felt the music was out of place.  Kudos for removing!
B00006690G|5.0|i am not a rap fan. i listen to mainly rock music. eminem is the only rapper i will make an exception for. honestly, i was brought up not to like him, but i always have anyway. i didnt really get into him until last summer, though. i got this cd for my birthday from my brother, and i love him for it. we're both eminem fans. my rents almost took it away from me after all the cussing, but i talked them out of it. i'm gonna cut the ...now, and just give you a rating of each song in my opinion:<br />1.curtains up-this is just an intro, no need to rate it.<br />2.white america-sweet song. 5/5<br />3.business-pretty cool. 4/5<br />4.cleanin out my closet-2nd single. awesome song and video.5/5<br />5.square dance-possibly my fav song on cd. i just love it. 5/5<br />6.the kiss-another skit. he goes a little overobard on the cussing, but whatever. thats eminem.<br />7.soldier-first time i heard it, i hated it. it grew on me a lot, tho 4.5/5<br />8.say goodbye hollywood-cool. 5/5<br />9.drips-ok, i do not like this one. i always skip it. 1/5<br />10.without me-first single. whats not to like? 5/5<br />11.paul rosenberg-skit.<br />12.sing for the moment-another awesome song. 5/5<br />13.superman-this is em's newest single that just came out as of the time of this review. 5/5<br />14.hailies song-great song to his daughter. sings in this one. 5/5<br />15.steve berman-skit.<br />16.when the music stops-okay, but not nearly as good as the rest. 3.5/5<br />17.say what you say-cool. 4.5/5<br />18.'till i collapse-awesome. 5/5<br />19.my dads gone crazy-hailie was a little annoying at first. def. grew on me. funny song. 5/5<br />20.curtains close-skit.<br />overall, an awesome cd that definetly is worth your money!! 5 star material, no questions asked. eminem is controversy, and i know some people hate him for it, but i love him. hes real, hes no fake, regardless of what some of you say. he is a cool guy whose songs have meaning and has some great lyrics, which can especially be shown in sing for the moment. this cd is much better than its predecessor, marshall mathers lp, which is average. i dont yet have his first cd, so i cant compare to that one. anyway, i highly recommend this cd, even if you're not really into rap.
B00005A46T|5.0|after reading many bad reviews 4 this cd i decided to right one for myself a truthful one. the truth is no this cd isnt like the one before it. iowa is alot heavier, i personly love this cd way more then their other 2(mate. kill. feed. repeat.,and slipknot) if u are a true fan you'll love this cd...... so get it!<BR>...
B0000004V2|5.0|Absolutely extraordinary. To my mind this is the definitive piece of modern music of the last 20 years. All the more remarkable that it should come from a band that seemingly vanished as quickly as it appeared.<br />It's hard to describe this album. There are several threads that work together; Each dark brooding lyric comes coupled with a soaring anthemic melody. You have airy psychedelica and no-nonsense consumate rock simultaneously. Moreover this record is a complete article - there's a groove to this work that ties each song to the next - I never shuffle this CD...each component is already in the right place. Almost 15 years after I bought CD it continues to be the mainstay of my collection - the one record that continues to spin regularly and the one I've turned the car around for again and again.<br />This is my favourite record of all time. Buy it. Rip it and then pack it away carefully for your offspring. Think \\"London Calling\\", \\"Revolver\\", \\"The Bends\\", \\"What's Going On\\". It's in that space of utter quality.
0312305060|1.0|When I read, I hear the voice of the narrator in my mind.  As I read &quot;The Hours&quot;, the voice I heard was that of a &quot;pretentious offbeat hippie&quot;, putting on airs in a coffee house of the 60's. My impressions may have been intended by the author, since much of his tale describes characters of the period, who populated the coffee houses of New York's Greenwich Village and the Near North side of Chicago of my own youth.  That the author was a Pulitzer Prize winner surprised me.  The book dragged initially, and I found myself wondering how one could make a movie of it.  It is definitely not my cup of tea.
B00006BTCA|4.0|If you rely on the reviews to decide whether or not to give Interpol a chance you'll wind up thinking that this might be yet another copycat effort in an otherwise dry and uninspired current rock scene.<BR>   So is this true then? Do Interpol sound like the Psychedelic Furs or the Joy Division or the Smiths, etc. etc. etc? Hmm, well, in all honesty, when i first heard the album i thought i heard tens of hints and references to several legendary bands of the 80s. Nevertheless, i couldn't come up with a direct comparison. Yes, Interpol combine many elements from the aforementioned bands while at the same time standing their ground with more than enough decency (that IS possible, you know)..<BR>    But, it would be unfair to compare these New Yorkers with the Strokes (the Strokes?? please..) or any of these \\"new\\" post 80s-postpunk-post whatever-post me a postcard bands. Why? Well, cuzz Interpol are simply better than that lot and because they emit a lot more pathos and involvement in their music. Sound good enough so far?<BR>    At their most capturing Interpol are best at their darkest. And dark they are mostly throughout as they narrate everyday stories which are paradoxically rare for the everyman.<BR>    Obviously they aren't rediscovering the moon but lets be fair here. There's a reason why the rock scene is stagnant these days and that reason is that it has become damn hard to sound original any more, if not impossible. On that term, this album is one of truly wonderful quality. And, lets face it, what are your choices if you wanna hear straight-out emotional, angsty and intriguing guitars? Limp Bizkit? I didn't think so either...
0060516070|5.0|One of his classics, and among the few that focuses on the practicioner (the manager) instead of the practice itself (management). Drucker delivers in his classic lucid style, insightful but never pedantic.  There are lots of truisms in this book, but the one that stands out is the power of focus -- do one thing at a time. In practice, this is among the hardest things to do for a manager.  As owner of a growing consulting firm, I am strecthced in all directions at all times.  Applying this simple principle -- focusing on a &quot;rock&quot;, as opposed to the &quot;pebbles&quot;, not only increased my productivity -- and thus revenues --  but level of personal satisfaction as well.  We all know what needs to be done. It's how to get it done (being effective) that's often the problem. Read this book and learn.
0671578855|5.0|After reading this book, which is an emotional roller coaster that will have you grinding your teeth, laughing, screaming, wincing in sympathy and just counting the seconds before you get to watch the charaters realize they've walked off the cliff with out noticing. It will leave you thoroughly glad Lois (delightfully evil woman that she is) isn't in charge of your love life. And then you like me, will wonder where you are going to find the money to give copies to all your friends and family.
B00005S8FC|5.0|For those of you who are in love with the Tango, this is the perfect album.  This CD is a joy to dance to.  The beat and changes in melody allow the dancer a real freedom.  The music gets inside your soul and it's hard to stop dancing once the song is over.
B000023VR6|5.0|The driving force behind rap takes back what's his with his much anticipated return to the scene. Incredible beats, sensational song writing, and savay delivery. The most influential person in the rap industry and it's not hard to see why.
079284131X|5.0|Child's Play has always been one of my favorite horror films and is one I can watch again and again. It's scary, but also has some humor. <br />I do wish however that the DVD version was available in widescreen format. I believe there are some scenes that have lost something by being converted to fullscreen.
B000002UA9|3.0|In hindsight, its hard to imagine a time when the Beatles were simply a struggling, up-and-coming act that had to scratch and claw its way into the studio, and were insecure enough about their own writing skills that they filled out most of their first disc, Please Please Me, with cover songs. It's also hard to imagine a time when the world outside of the UK and Europe barely knew who they were, and the only songs anyone might know would have been the minor hit Love Me Do, and the first breakthrough hit, the title track of this album. We didn't have the many rock stations that we have now that constantly have Beatles songs that range from the obscure to the most famous in their rotations. Back then, you were lucky to have ONE station, and certainly you didn't have only rock and roll playing on it.<BR>It's in this context that you have to listen to this disc, and forget that you have heard several of these tracks a million times already. This is a great first step for the band, and features such early classics as the already mentioned Love Me Do, the title track, along with I Saw Her Standing There and the incredible cover of the Isley Brothers' Twist and Shout. The Beatles knew not only how to bring out the best in a cover, but how to make it their own. Certainly, when one thinks of Twist and Shout, its these guys, not the Isley's, that you think of first.<BR>Other notables: an early Paul McCartney ballad, PS I Love You, the George Harrison-sung (and John Lennon-written) Do You Want To Know A Secret?, and a raucous rocker sung by the lovable Ringo Starr, called Boys.<BR>But despite the great promise shown here, there are still enough clunkers to show that they weren't the greatest team in the world just yet. Anna, Ask Me Why, and There's A Place are skippable and avoidable. A Taste Of Honey is slightly haunting, but in the end wears thin. The band's musicianship is pretty much straight-forward, and nothing about this album points to the experimentation and risk-taking that would eventually become standard fare from the Liverpudlian foursome.<BR>A good solid start. Worth having, but not the best album by the Fab Four.
0375414053|5.0|This is an excellent book that I would recommend to every working moms who have been juggling between life and work. Despite different life scenario, the similarity between Kate's and my feeling and thoughts constantly strikes me throughout the book. The scnario is so real and sadly, applicable to my own life. It could replace my own dairy! This book was recommended by my career counselor, now I would like to recommend it to you.
B00006JJ1O|5.0|This is a great album! All of the songs fit well together, and I can honestly say that there wasn't a single song I didn't enjoy. This CD ranges from techno (Not Gonna Get Us) to pop (All the Things she Said) to beautiful sadness (30 minutes) to mixtures of many elements. It is rare that a foreign artist (especially Russian!) makes a statement in the American music world, but t.A.T.u., you got it!
0066214122|1.0|This ranks as one of the worst books I've ever purchased.<br />It ramples with shallow characters.   The writing is just terrible.   At one point a group of characters runs around acting like birds (they're seriously attempting to avoid getting killed) in an attempt to fool the Prey.<br />Don't buy it!
B000002L9W|5.0|In 1985, when Dave was still in Van Halen, he had two big solo hits &quot;California Girls&quot; and &quot;Just a gigolo.&quot;  When Dave left VH, he couldn't be a viable solo artist just covering lounge songs and Beach Boy hits, he needed to put together a rock band, one that was as good, if not better, than his old band.  This is just what Dave did.  He got Steve Vai for guitar, Billy Sheehan for bass, and Gregg Bissonette for drums.  Not only was his first solo band, the &quot;Eat 'Em and Smile&quot; band technically as good as Van Halen, but it wrote songs that were up-to-par with VH classics.  In my humble opinion, the Eat 'Em and Smile album was as good as the first six Van Halen albums.  I see this album as being the true follow-up to Van Halen's 1984.  In a sense, I see this as being the seventh Van Halen album.  I also think that this album is far superior to Van Halen's first album with Sammy Hagar, 5150.  Like the first six Van Halen albums, this album is only about a half hour, and rocks top to bottom.  It is filled with heavy, catchy rifts, color, melody, and humor.  There are a lot of classic rockers on this album, such as &quot;Yankee Rose,&quot; &quot;Going Crazy!&quot; and &quot;Shy Boy.&quot;  There are a few lounge numbers--&quot;I'm Easy,&quot; and &quot;That's Life.&quot;  There are a few slower numbers such as &quot;Ladies Night in Buffalo?&quot; and &quot;Big Trouble.&quot;  Overall, this album is a straight-a-head rocker, with no ballads or synth-pop.  If you are a fan of the David Lee Roth era of Van Halen, than this CD is a must have!
B0000029DD|5.0|Jeff Buckley's album GRACE is by far the best music I've heard in a long time! Seeking an escape from the radio's tendency to overplay the same old songs, I came across this awesome musician. It is a pity he is no longer with us to bring more great albums, but GRACE can be listened to over and over~ I'd reccomend this album to anyone who wants to hear some good old music plain and simple.
B000001ES9|3.0|So what if Neil \\"drum god\\" Peart wasn't in the band yet. So what if more than a few of the licks and riffs sound like they were lifted from a Led Zeppelin 101 class. So what if the lyrics are basically teen angst cliches. This is good solid rock and roll.<BR>Released in 1974, Rush is the debut album from a band that would go on to do bigger and better things throughout their surprisingly successful careers, despite efforts from critics and radio station managers to rid the world of Geddy's high-end 'chipmunk on speed' vocals. Their fans know what they like, and they know good music. And it all started here with a document of a time that was unique for the Canadian trio. <BR>As was alluded to before, they wear their collective influences on their sleeves, but for a bunch of kids (they were only about 19 - 20 years old when this was recorded), the playing is just professional enough and the songwriting is just original enough to make you sit up and take notice. <BR>Gems from this classic rocker include the lead off track, Finding My Way. Also, the 'Heartbreaker'-inspired What You're Doing. The album's big finale, Working Man, is not only a catchy rocking jam, but also a rarity of sorts in that, the words sound more like they should be on a Bob Segar album than a Rush one.<BR>The band hadn't begun to flex its prog-rock muscles yet, but you can hear them foreshadow it with the gentle extended opener to the kick butt Before and After. It starts off as if it might be an instrumental ballad, but builds to a crescendo, bursting into one of the best riffs on the disc.<BR>But a few of the tracks are simply exercises in derivative rock, such as Take A Friend and Need Some Love, and the Skynyrd-ish In the Mood. But you can't help but groove along, and that alone makes it worthy. Sometimes, you just gotta have fun. And its here that you get Rush doing that very thing with energy and youthful zest. Decent first record. If you like Zeppelin, or you just want to hear what Rush sounds like with John Rutsey on drums, this is for you. But better things were to come...
B000002VSN|5.0|This CD is another of Whitney's greats.  She got to take it back home to the church where she came from and her heart still is.  &quot;I Love the Lord&quot; is just heartwarming just as the rest of her songs.  You will also get the chance {for all those that don't know}to hear her mom on here. Alot of the unchurched love this CD also.  THE MOVIE WAS NOT BAD EITHER!
B00005QZWI|5.0|I saw the film and knew the soundtrack was excellent, but it was after my first careful listening on CD that I knew it was the best of the year--hands down.<br />What makes this the finest soundtrack since &quot;Saving Private Ryan&quot; is its uncanny ability to, in one moment, exude the grand proportions via lush orchestration (vast choral and string parts) demanded by this epic film, and in the next moment bop happily along a sunny field in the Shire with a Hobbit.<br />Each musical cue DOES something, GOES somewhere, is melodically pleasing and provides musical PAYOFF.  No one enjoys listening to a seemingly abstract collection of musical cues that only make sense in the context of viewing a film.  A soundtrack that is perfectly fitted to its original purpose (complement a film) AND stands alone as a musical statement (as this one does), is great.  But a soundtrack that does this AND is both epic in scale and captures the character of the story (as this one does)?<br />Well, that's worthy of an Oscar (as this one won)!
B00000K2VZ|5.0|This is one amazing album, from the first track to last.  Every single song is bleeding with emotion, and not just from Janis, but from her band as well.  All the members of Full Tilt Boogie are first class musicians.  I was particularly impressed with the guitarist.  His solo on &quot;My Baby&quot; is very soulful and bluesy.  That's what this album is at heart: a blues album.  The only thing that I would like to have heard is a longer version of &quot;Bobby McGee&quot; where the band jams for even longer.  I recommend this album to anyone who is a fan The Allman Brothers, Otis Redding, and music in general!
B000002UAC|3.0|The Beatles were beginning to become more confident in themselves as a recording act, and you can hear it in the solid playing found on this disc. The first album was hastily assembled, and sounded loose and a tad raw. Here the band had more time, and were able to put forth more professional performances without losing any of the fun vitality that marks this legendary band.<BR>The formula of the first disc is followed here, with 8 of the tracks being written by the band, and the rest consisting of cover versions of their favorite American songs. PS I Love You was the ballad on the first disc from Paul, and here he covers the show tune from The Music Man, Till There Was You. A sweet, forgettable number, but a showcase for Mr. McCartney's growing popularity among the female fans of the group.<BR>Also, George Harrison is given a couple of numbers here, as on the previous disc. The difference here is that one of them marked his songwriting debut, a standard beat-rocker called Don't Bother Me. A decent start for his songwriting career.<BR>Drummer Ringo Starr is showcased on another blazing rock song, as his last vocal performance (Boys) was so successful for the band live that Lennon and McCartney put their heads together and knocked out I Wanna Be Your Man for him. They also gave this song to The Rolling Stones, who issued it as their second UK single.<BR>And for the finale, another cover of a great R and B classic, Money, is handed to the able John Lennon, who shreds and rips the vocals as his bandmates sing along and provide a catchy exciting canvas. Its no Twist and Shout, but is a good closer for the disc.<BR>The Paul classic All My Loving is found here, and other highpoints are It Won't Be Long and the George-sung cover of Roll Over, Beethoven. This version destroys the original Chuck Berry version, and almost leaps off the disc at you. Perfect pop/rock bliss.<BR>A few generic offerings do abound, such as Hold Me Tight, Little Child, and Devil In Her Heart. The other songs are average, but only serve to build anticipation for the stronger tracks that have been mentioned. Skip buttons are a gift, aren't they?<BR>But even with those few slow spots, this is great rock and roll from a great rock and roll band. They still were climbing that ladder, and hadn't really found themselves yet in way that would set them heads and shoulders above the other bands out at the time, but it certainly was a boost. A fun album, and a stepping stone towards better things to come.
B000060P79|2.0|Yeah I think this album has only a few good songs. Like the first track &quot;I'd do anything&quot;(featuring the great Mark Hoppus) and &quot;I'm just a kid&quot;. Those are my favorite songs. The rest of the album is ok but it's way to poppy and It gets so boring after a while. I mean I like pop/punk and all but this is like really POP with some punk influence. But don't get me wrong they kickass live. After a few listens to it the cover and booklet photos are the only interesting thing. Well if you like a poppier version if Blink 182, give it a listen.
B000062YB1|5.0|Seasons in the Abyss is quite possibly the greatest Slayer alblum to date. <BR>With such classic tracks as Dead Skin Mask, War Ensamble, Seasons in the Abyss, Skeletons of Society, and many more, Slayer delivers the sound of a wall of screaming stacks pumped directly into your brain. <BR>I would reccomend this alblum to any longtime Slayer fan, or any fan ot thrash and speed metal!
B000000H57|5.0|This is the drab 4's most \\"ROMANTIC\\" album and a good one to listen to when you have your significant other over for the night.:-P  Songs like \\"Cinnamon Girl\\", \\"Love You to Death\\", and \\"My Girlfriend's Girlfriend\\" are all well played masterpiece of Goth/Metal romaticism....very catchy guitar work and beats really set the mood...this is yet another masterpiece in the history of Steele.
0679735909|1.0|This is without doubt, the worst written book ever.<br />EVER. AS Byatt writes with extremely pretentious language. She uses words that only the best dictionaries have. Within the first 160 pages, absolutely nothing happens. The mindboggling slowness of these 160 pages is only exceeded in incompetence in the non-stop interruptions of her story, with bad poems and bad fairy tales.<br />The book is so badly written, with so much unneccessary padding, and so many unneccessary interruptions. ... and while there may be pretentious values of the book like \\"postmodern\\" techniques and all that, it is a very slow, poorly written, difficult book. There is no great meaning or message. A twist, but, who cares? 500+ pages of agony
B00007BH5C|3.0|HOWARD STONE IN AN INTERVIEW ON THE EXTENDED DVD SAID WRITING THIS SCORE WAS LIKE WRITING AN OPERA.  WELL, HE IS STILL WRITING<BR>HIS OPERA.  GRANTED THE MUSIC MUST BE SEMI-CLASSICAL BECAUSE OF THE AGE PERIOD HE IS DEALING WITH, BUT MUST THERE BE SO MUCH<BR>CHORAL MUSIC?  <br />TO ME AS I HAVE SAID BEFORE, JACKSON SHOULD HAVE OBTAINED THE TALENTS OF DAVID ARKENSTONE TO DO THIS SCORE.  IF NOT DAVID THEN JOHN WILLIAMS.  BOTH ARE MORE IN TUNE WITH SOUNDTRACKS OF THIS<BR>TYPE STORY I FEEL.<br />BUT IF YOU LIKE OPERA YOU WILL ENJOY THIS SOUNDTRACK ALL THE MORE.........
0385508417|2.0|I am amazed at all the good reviews here about this book.  I am a fan of John Grisham and have enjoyed all his books, but this one was a major dissappointment. I can't believe he wrote it.<br />It's not that I object to a subject other that the law,(\\"A Painted House\\" was most enjoyable). The subject of this book, skipping the holidays & doing something else, sounded interesting and I had high hopes when I started reading, but Grisham's heart was obviously not in it.<br />Skip \\"Skipping Christmas\\".
B00005221M|3.0|This is my all time favorite movie, but I was so dissapointed in the DVD version. There were some scenes that were cut out that should have been left in. If you have never seen this movie, I reccomend the VHS version, it is by far better than the DVD.
B000000H6D|5.0|This mixes the best of both world's unless you own the paper covered 9 song copy that they have above(the original has about 15 songs)...it has all the slow romatic songs and about 4 punkish..speed metal songs..\\"Kill All the White People\\"(hilarious) ect...and nobody can forget Type O's pinnacle \\"Black #1\\" where Pete pokes fun at the Goth lifestyle....with such atmosphere and a very memorable bass and guitar line(one of my fave songs to cover:-))...If you can only own 1 T.O.N album..make \\"Bloody Kisses\\" that choice as it it a great mix of both of Type O's great sounds...and will not dissapoint.
0553573403|5.0|I am a huge fan of George R. R. Martin and have been so ever since reading his superb sci fi short story, Sandkings. I was pleasantly surprised to find that Martin wrote fantasy as well, and eagerly picked up A Game of Thrones. I was not disappointed; it is one of the best fantasy novels I have ever read. The characters are not only believable, but their lives are so captivating that I was unable to put the book down.<br />One reviewer complained that the novel is poorly written. I would like to dispute this. There is so much drivel and swill that passes for fantasy and sci fi nowadays that it is a breath of fresh air to read such a finely crafted work. The same critic compared Martin unfavorably with Tolkein. I personally found A Game of Thrones to be much more accessible and interesting than Lord of the Rings. It is no surprise Martin's novel garnered a Nebula nomination and won the 1996 Locus Award for Best Fantasy Novel.<br />If you're looking for an engrossing fantasy novel with good guys you'll cheer and bad guys you'll curse, then this is for you. The characters are wonderfully flawed and human, and the story has plenty of unexpected twists and turns that'll keep you riveted. The dwarf, Tyrion, is one of the most interesting characters in fiction today, in any genre.<br />Read and enjoy!
B00006RU5B|1.0|Everyone has forgotten the whole meaning behind Rage Against the Machine's music, one minute the band close down wall street, next minute they're on a 50 foot high stage rocking it out with Fireworks in the background. OK maybe the band never stood for that except for De la Rocha, but the meaninig of the words and the sheer anger of De La Rocha made Rage what they are. Instead, Morello digs out another fossil riff from their lost archives [well it sounds like it] and it isn't exactly hard to come up with a verse and chorus for Rage riffs since there is no real melody, just funky ostinatos. There isn't an even a breakthrough in sound what so ever, just a band drowned in boundaries.<br />Anyone who likes Soundgarden and RATM but is too lazy to get up and change records should buy this. Unfortunately Rages' repetitive rocking riffs and Cornell's bitter pretentious vocals are dated and sounded good 10 years ago. Rage Against the Machine were one of the main transistions of commercial rock from the 80s to the 90s, but this watery cocktail makes them sound like they've taken several steps back.<br />I heard the first five tracks from this album, and like a bad movie, I didn't wanna know how it ended. I guess they pulled off the angsty rock ballad, but they do it as if they were the very first or something.<br />I'm not going to recommend anything instead of this record, but the first stage is to turn off, because silence seems to make more sense.<br />Face it, they will never be able to relive those golden days with tunes like 'Killing in the Name' but they're obviously brainwashed by some kind of money machine.<br />The commercial rock scene is almost a mirror image of the pop scene; people like their music the same over, and over and over. Audioslave lead the way!<br />This is overproduced, washed up caveman rock. Please avoid
B00005JL96|5.0|What a Fantastic movie!  It moved my heart even more than the Lion King and Shrek.  The characters are totally endearing and the story is delightful.  It was exciting and funny, with the animation done in such a remarkable way that it showed even the most subtle emotions.  The voices were perfect, even to Nani and David's lovely Hawaiian lilt.  Because of the super team that made this movie, both voice cast and animators, we knew what the characters were feeling - and we felt it too.  This movie grabbed our hearts and dragged us along for the whole super story.  I owned a copy by 9 AM on the first morning this movie went on sale.  We've watched it many times but my heart still stops when Stitch says, &quot;Lost&quot;, and &quot;Waiting&quot; and when Lilo says, &quot;Don't leave me, ok?&quot;.  Disney, you did one heckuva job on this one, thanks!
B00005V3Z4|5.0|It is too hard to try to critique this movie in the starndard plot and theme way. If you have ever had your mind running on too many things at once and it scared you this is your flick. Jake Gyllenhaal delivers one of his best performances ever. I will not give any of the movie away but if you have any doubts try and rent it before you buy it. But I think you will buy it anyway. Jake Gyllenhaal plays the title role of Donnie Darko who is a very troubled but brilliant teenager. The power of this movie depends on your observatory skills and your imagination. This is the best movie I have seen in a very very long time.
0967984602|5.0|I ran a summer family camp in July 2002 and built the smaller oven in one day.  I had kids from age two to fifty two stomping the clay, sand, hay and water with thier feet. I set fire in the oven on day two and made our first loaf of bread.  The directions are easy to follow and was a hit with my fourty campers.  I would highly recommend this book.  A great family or group activity!  Loved it.
B00005OAIE|5.0|This is a great CD. Sorry I came to this CD so late. If seems like I am the only one, I noticed that no less than three of the songs on this CD (No Such Thing, Your Body is a Wonderland and Back to You) were on the Mix radio's most requested play list for this past year. And that doesn't even include my favorite- City Love. The tracks Why Georgia and Neon also get some airplay. <BR>     John Mayer is up for a Grammy for Your Body is a Wonderland and for New Artist of the Year! That really says something.  This is truly a CD where every song is good. When was the last time you could say that? <BR>    Like always, it's the music and voice of the artist is what first attracts you to a CD and this one has it- especially when Mayer uses his change of pace musical shifts. If you like his gravely voice, ala Dave Matthews, (one of my favorites artists) you will enjoy every song on this CD.  I think it's OK that he sounds like Matthews, because he has so much to offer in his music- from acoustic riffs to the fullness of the strings on City Love.  <BR>     Though it's the music is first attracts you to this CD the lyrics are pure poetry. And that it one of the reasons you can listen to this CD over and over. The more you listen, the more songs you like and your favorites will enlarge. The more songs you are still singing the next day. Wait I think my new favorite is St. Patrick's Day. <BR>     The more you listen, the more of those gems of poetry will stick in your subconscious, make you smile and jolt your heart. They are clever and seem to hit right on when he is trying to invoke a very specific personal human feeling, or failing. My Stupid Mouth is definitely my favorite song.   <BR>     Mayer's songs are not really stories but emotional snippets about epiphanies we make throughout our lives.  Like \\"I just found out there is no such thing as the real world.\\" Wait a second, great music with snappy lyrics sounds a lot like a pop Michael Franks. I predict he will have as longand successful career as Franks.<BR>     I think my new favorite track is No Such Thing. Did I say that this is a Great CD? Buy it and you'll keep saying that too.
B00005JL2O|3.0|Yes, the title sequence at the beginning of &quot;Goldmember&quot; is al all star classic, with cameos by Tom Cruise, Gwyneth Paltrow, Steven Speilberg, Danny DiVito and many others offering a laugh-out-loud 10 minutes.  But after that, &quot;Goldmember&quot; is a hodge-podge of uninspired and been-there-done-that dialogue from the great Mike Meyers.  I'd really hoped for a more lively episode, along the lines of the first two movies, and was clearly disappointed.  Beyonce Knowles - GORGEOUS HERE - is solid as Foxy Cleopatra, but the rest of the cast seems like they are just going through the motions.  Even Meyers himself seems to be channeling SNL characters rather than focusing on making this funny.  Let's hope the next Austin Powers movie finds him back in real fine shape, bay-bee.
B00005MP58|5.0|Further praise of this wonderful production seems superfluous after all the other glowing reviews on this site, but I have to add my voice to the many others who have fallen under the spell of this excellent rendering of Jane Austen's novel. <BR>I am amused by those who commend this series for its wholesome, family-friendly nature. On one level, they are absolutely correct. Certainly, it contains no violence,  rough language, or sex and would make perfectly appropriate viewing for all ages. Yet, from an adult perspective, the chemistry between Colin Firth as Darcy and Jennifer Ehle as Elizabeth Bennet, the intensity of their performances, the restraints imposed by the customs of the time and the long, long buildup until they finally get together winds up the erotic tension to an almost unbearable level. Ehle is captivating, lovely and intelligent as Elizabeth. No surprise that she's the only daughter Mr. Bennet relates to as an equal. Colin Firth's performance is a wonder. Has an actor ever communicated more eloquently with his eyes? They are by turns pools of pain, of frustration, of longing and, finally, of warmth and love as he watches Elizabeth at the piano at Pemberley. Minor characters are perfectly cast. I particularly like Mr. Bennet, so clearly unhappy with the egregiously awful Mrs. Bennet. Hiding out in his study, Mr. Bennet is the 19th century version of Dad in the den with the remote. That's Austen's genius, I suppose--creating characters that we can identify with, despite the gap in time, place and social customs. Kudos to the screenwriter and to the wonderful cast for so skillfully conveying both the historical setting of Austen's story and the timeless humanity of her characters.
B0000214F2|5.0|I first saw this movie last year and it is one of my son's favorite adult films that he is allowed to watch with supervision.  A man that is so depressed that he self commits himself to a mental ward at Fairfax Hospital, VA., feeling that he has no purpose in life and makes no difference that he exists.  He realizes that the therapy he is receiving makes him feel no better, but realizes that the inmakes on the ward are in worse shape than he is and getting no better either. He finds that he, as a patient, more in touch with reality, tries a different approach and he makes a difference.  Thus begins the transformation of Patch Adams, who makes it his life long dedication to help people who are worse off than he is and to use the  special talents and intelligence given to him to become a doctor. I have spent a great deal of time at Fairfax Hospital for care of my children and medical care I required.Two of my children were born there.Doctors have become more sensitive to patients than in the past. Some refuse to give up the stiffness, that is their own problem of not being able to change.  Perhaps Patch Adams is a bit strong for some to deal with, but his patients respected him for his ability to see them as human beings.Patch insisted to know the name of a patient, as Fairfax Hospital and many other hospitals are teaching hospitals.  The medical profession has come a long way for doctors who see the light that Patch Adams was trying to shine to open their eyes, that book knowledge is only part of being a good doctor.  Patch Adams wanted doctors to see that if they wanted respect from their patients, they needed to respect their patients and understand that they had feelings, and to  at least call them by their name.  The children in the cancer ward, if one is knowledgeable, there are Child Life Programs to deal with the feelings and help the children who are long term or terminal patients to deal with the  trauma of hospitalization, and deal with the medical proceedures that the children will be experiencing to reduce their fear, a job the medical staff is too overloaded with to  perform while doing their own responsibilities to have time to spend to add to their load. The best hospitals in the country all have Child Life Programs, Fairfax Hospital, Children's Hospital in Pittsburgh, and John Hopkins, to name a few. Patch Adams' colleagues realized that he had a good point, it was just a concept that they were never taught as part of their medical practice. The movie was meant to teach a story, but at the same time to be entertaining.  No patient likes an arrogant doctor who thinks that he is a superior being to a patient, or who does not  take the time to consider what the patient is trying to tell them. Patch Adams was a dedicated doctor who felt that the needs of his patients included more than medication.  He never felt medicine was not part of their care or medical school would not have been so critical to him. Mrs. Symmington
B00004XQ83|5.0|There is really nothing new to add to my predecessors' reviews. This is a wonderful soundtrack for those who want to explore different types of musical formats. It is quite remarkable how this release went platinum several times over.<br />Perhaps what makes this CD so appealing is that in this package, there are several well-vocalized and finely played songs that tell a story and that add a little humor. Sadly, many in today's entertainment world have become so deeply entrenched in a Sex Sells mindset that they forget the refinements that create enjoyable, good-quality entertainment.<br />After observing trends that have come about for the last three decades, many, including myself, once thought that bluegrass is a type of music that belonged to times and eras that have since passed and could never really again reach out to mainstream audiences.<br />All in all, I would say that in terms of reviving bluegrass, the O Brother, Where Art Thou? Soundtrack is this decade's equivalent to The Nitty Gritty Dirt Band's Will the Circle Be Unbroken from 1972.
B00006IUL7|4.0|Easily one of the most suspenseful films of 2002, &quot;Insomnia&quot; is a showcase for Al Pacino, Robin Williams and Hilary Swank - threee Oscar winners who prove their mettle in this fast-paced thriller that's perfect for the long cold winter we're experiencing this year.  Williams is a maniacal presence, proving again that the actor can play against type and control his acting chops without going off on tangents.  Swank, in a thankless role as a rookie local cop, makes the best of the character's essence as she lovingly learns from Pacino's character.  And Al Pacino hasn't been this good in years - his &quot;HOO-HAW&quot; inflections from &quot;Scent of a Woman&quot; have faded, and he's all character here.  See it for these three performances and for a taut script that has twists at every turn.
B00006JJ1O|5.0|...after months of trying, really trying to understand the excitement around this group and their music, I now play it on repeat while working on my computer. Somewhere in medias attention, their sexual disposition seemed more important to discuss than their music, and the appearance on the MTV European Music Awards, that included acts of love between the two girls, made the whole world jump in their seats of aversion. Why not put all of that aside, and listen to their wonderful music instead? Don't they deserve to be judged as any other popartist or group, by the proffessionalism and competens as musicians? Sure, they don't write their own songs, but how many popartist can brag about that? After my daughter had played \\"All the things she said\\" about five million times, and I repeteadly heard and read about them on the news, radio and on the Internet, and still couldn't figure out what it was about these girls and that song that made them so popular, a good friend of mine told me to listen to the other songs on the album. He played \\"Not gonna get us\\" for me, and I was immediately hooked. I got shivers by the innocent voices that seemed to reach higher than no one has ever reached before, and the beats, synthesizer solo's, the lyrics...suddenly it hit me: this is good music, this is NOT only a PR thing, haussed by media and brought to fame only by the sexual aspect of their appearance. Teenagers see beyond that, and concentrate on what's really important in this issue: music. So, listen to the very catchy and well produced \\"Not gonna get us\\", \\"All the things she said\\", the first two singles from the album. But don't forget to hear out \\"Malchic gay\\", \\"How soon is now\\", and the beautiful \\"30 minutes\\". And please, don't forget to listen to the lyrics - the word sounds more sinsere when sung by a young girl with an angel-like, honest, yet fragile voice. Don't be prejudice about \\"all the things they say\\" - buy the album and make your own opinion. (And please forgive my english, I'm getting there!) Love, Dia.
B00005B6C9|5.0|I grew up with the Bee Gees, so to speak.  I was here in Pittsburgh when the concert was on T.V. to introduce this album.  They sang many of their oldies to please the audience, and sang songs from this album.  It led me to think that there was something that was going to take this wonderful group away from us.  I bought the CD and my two daughters were married within a short span of each other that year.  The Sacred Trust and the Wedding Song, along with several other songs seemed so appropriate as a gift to the two of them.  I feel so privledged to have been able to view the concert twice on T.V. and be able to know of this CD to buy it and share it with my daughters.  Today Maurice was taken from us.  I will always cherish this CD as it was the last  time I saw the Bee Gees perform with their wonderful musical diversity which is on this CD.  It diverts from the style that we were used to hearing from the past, but it showed that with the 40 years of pleasing their audience, they also were changing as the years went on but in no way was the quality of their music less. There is only one way to describe this CD: Excellence.  Mrs. Symmington
B00006LLLN|5.0|I am not exactly a fan of bluegrass music by any stretch of the means, but there are times when listening to tunes of my favorite music formats can get quite old. I first saw Alison Krauss on television when she performed a couple of selections in a recorded live production of Carolina Calling, a highly popular, local PBS program enjoyed among North Carolina viewers.<br />This 2-Disc set is quite enjoyable. For those, including myself, who are not into the twangy side of bluegrass but nonetheless have an appreciation for excellent instrumental performances with banjos and dobros harmonized quite well with the lovely vocals of Ms. Krauss, they will likely find the second disc to be the better half of this set. <br />And let me say that this performance is a classic case of how a good start can lead up to a fabulous ending.
B000003RCY|5.0|THIS ALBUM IS A DEFINITE MUST!<br />All the songs are Rammstein Classics!  Full of adrenaline throughout.<br />Great debut album by Rammstein (1995).  Will come as the 'American re-release'.  At least that is how it was sent to me, not the album with the cover of the flower behind Rammstein members, but the white background with the faces of the Rammstein members.<br />GREAT CD, DON'T HESITATE TO BUY IT!!!!
0792839730|3.0|A Bridge Too Far is one of those movies that you feel just has to be great.  It was directed by Richard Attenborough with a screenplay by William Goldman.  It has a superior cast including Michael Caine, Anthony Hopkins, Robert Redford, James Caan, Elliot Gould, Gene Hackman, Laurence Olivier and Sean Connery.  With all this, it should be great, but it isn't.<br />The problem is the epic scale of the movie: it is the story of an Allied operation in 1944 designed to bring the war to a close in one fell swoop.  It is a complicated operation with things going on everywhere and the movie follows it all.  As a result, the characters themselves are not very important; the action is everything.<br />There are a few memorable performances, in particular by Caan, Gould and Redford, but they are not nearly enough to carry the movie.  No one is in much more than 25% of the movie, and many for far less; there is no one for the viewer to really get attached to, which limits the amount of the interest that can be sustained.  <br />There is also a lot in this movie that is reminiscent of other World War II movies from the same general era; even the music invokes thoughts of other such movies.  So the movie has kind of a been-there-done-that sort of feel.  If the movie has too much talent to make it bad, it also doesn't use that talent enough to make it good.  If you are big on WWII epics, this may be your cup of tea, but otherwise, this can be skipped without missing anything.
B00005JKQZ|3.0|I have to say that I was pretty dissapointed with this movie. The media and all the awards it got made it look like a fantastic movie, but I didn't really care for it. The only reason I watched it was my cousin forced me too. He probably only liked it because he has this &quot;thing&quot; for Russel Crowe. I thought it was kinda strange and a little hard to follow. This movie is kind of like biography that belongs on A&amp;E, not on the big screen. I was pretty bored through a lot of the movie. Sure, it's cool and everything how smart the guy was and all the things he did, but the movie was just hideously boring. I'm not even sure I agree with the 3 stars I gave it. Sorry, but pass this movie up. It's more of a &quot;there's nothing else left at the store, I guess we could rent this&quot; movie. For those of you out there that liked this movie.... Enjoy!
B0000039LE|4.0|Before I saw Halloween, I though it was going to be a stupid dumb horror movie like childs play (no offense i just though they were funny). But when it started with that erie pumpkin I knew this was going to be scary. It all got really scary when Michael Myers started comming out of no where and looking at Lorie strode(Curtis). That was scary!  And when Lorie and her friend are driving in the car and talk to the dad of the frind and find out that a mask and knives(WINK WINK) are stolen. After i saw this movie I was scared to the bone. But there were stupid things, like how does Michael know how to drive a car, and why did he pick up that dog when he killed it.
B00005AAFS|5.0|This was the first Rammstein CD I purchased...and all of the tracks on the CD are each hits on their own.<br />From Mein herz Brennt to Mutter and Sonne, to Links 2 3 4... I could go on but to describe them would not do them justice... you have to hear it to feel it.<br />This album like all of Rammstein's songs have longevity... I have listened to this album everyday for almost 2 months!  I don't know if that is only a sign of a die-hard fan or of a unique and refreshing music group.  I think it is both.<br />Not only have I thoroughly enjoyed listening to the music over and over and over again, but I have even begun to learn some German thanks to the album and it's insert with the lyrics (In German).  I have translated most of it by going to various Rammstein websites and translation sites.<br />I would NOT HESITATE one second to buy this album...I WISH I HAD ONLY DONE SO SOONER!<br />ITS A GREAT BUY!  YOU WILL NOT BE DISSAPOINTED!!!!

0553106635|5.0|I don't know, if I were George Martin and by some metaphysical quirk all of his characters somehow came to life, I'd be very very worried.  The afterlife of this world he's created here is certainly getting crowded.  Someone, somewhere must be starting some kind of pool to try and guess which characters will make it to the end of the series.  At this point I couldn't even guess.  This is one of the few books I've ever read that has absolutely no sense of \\"false jeopardy\\" at all, you know when a character is in danger but you know he's not truly in any danger because the author would never kill him?  That's all out the window here.  There are hundreds of characters in the book and there are still some minor characters from the first book that have survived while so called \\"main\\" characters have fallen by the wayside.  Anyway, if you're reading this it's either to a) see if you agree with my opinion of the book or b) you're curious to see if this series is any good.  Too many series start off good and then go swiftly downhill, rest assured, amazingly enough the quality has been maintained since the start.  Each book heralds big changes (some permanent, some less so) for all the characters and there's not a sense that Martin is just killing time while he pumps out books.  After three books the series is just as gripping as it has ever been and if he coasted on momentum alone for the last few books (I hear there's a total of six) it would still be pretty decent.  This remains one of the most realized fantasy worlds I've ever read, sure there's magic but it's kept pretty much in the background, no pompous battles of flashy wizards here, the focus here is all on plot and charactization.  Another thing I have to credit Martin for and it's done so skillfully that you might not notice it, how wonderfully detailed the backstory and history of this land is.  It spans several thousand years but there's no big \\"history appendix\\" at the end of the book, it's all done through dialogue and he really gives it a mythical sense, even the stuff that only happened twenty years before the series starts.  The history itself almost becomes a character.  There'll probably be calls for Martin to write a sort of \\"prequel\\" to this series, since he makes it seems so exciting, but hopefully he'll resist since all that would do is fill in the blanks really.  Best to leave 'em wanting more.  Anyway, everything that made the first two books great is here in spades, and I for one am eagerly anticipating the next book.  And I'm not normally a big fantasy fan.  Go figure.ogue and he really gives it a mythical sense, even the stuff that only happened twenty years before the series starts.

B00005OAIE|4.0|I'm hopelessly addicted to this CD.  I purchased it on a whim.  I had heard &quot;No Such Thing&quot; a few times while at the gym and liked it.  I had also read a few reviews and was interested in hearing more of JM.  I got it in the mail a few days ago and I just can't stop listening to it.  <br />Although at times JM reminds me of Dave Matthews Band, Genesis and bits of other artists, that in no way takes away from this stellar CD.  The songwriting is great.  The musicianship is superb.  And the lyrics, although seemingly shallow at first listen, are deeper than their first impression.<br />I highly recommend this album!
B00007E8V4|5.0|This is a good album. I have all but the first 1. I like all the songs on this album. This is a keeper.
6304806442|5.0|I saw this movie in the theatre when it first came out. I was an active heroin user at the time, but also found the movie extremely good (what I could remember of it). Of course when I did see it, I was also under the influence of the drug, so i wasn't constantly conscience through parts of it. For the past 3 years i have been in recovery, and could NOT bring myself to watch it,(although I  did want to see it again) on account that I feared bringing heroin back into my thoughts, and perhaps thinking of only the \\"good things\\" it did for me. But anyway, I did decide to rent it just recently, because my wife, who is also in recovery, wanted to see it for the first time. The experience I got from it this time was not of glamour, but of the absolute, gut-wretching, not wanting to go on anymore, just wanting to end the pain and die attitude, and the dead-end street in had brought to my life. This movie is truly a wake-up call, and a remember when for me. Something I would NOT ever want to go back to, but also something I want to keep up front to remember what it really did do to my life and the depths it brought me down to. The junkie-life in Scotland, is the same there, as it is here or anywhere else in the world for that matter. The movie doesn't flinch from depicting the horrid consequences of heroin use, but it never lets you forget that most people do it because it feels better than anything else. It's surrealistic and speedy, in a rock video kind of way. It approachs the dead-end scene of heroin use.The movie is NOT for everyone. And as I read from one reviewer, probably not for most. But if you are interested about what this crap does to ones life, or have a friend or family member hooked on it, it's a good movie depicting what these people go through on a day to day basis. Highly Recommended

I'v been a Vin Diesel fan ever since The Fast and the Furious, and i thank this is a better movie. Vin is the same guy in all of his movies, so if you like vin's other movie's you will like this one. Co-staring Cole Hauser(Hart's War), Keith David(Marked for Death). try out Predator or blade.

For the past 3 years i have been in recovery, and could NOT bring myself to watch it,(although I  did want to see it again) on account that I feared bringing heroin back into my thoughts, and perhaps thinking of only the \\"good things\\" it did for me. But anyway, I did decide to rent it just recently, because my wife, who is also in recovery, wanted to see it for the first time. The experience I got from it this time was not of glamour, but of the absolute, gut-wretching, not wanting to go on anymore, just wanting to end the pain and die attitude, and the dead-end street in had brought to my life. This movie is truly a wake-up call, and a remember when for me. Something I would NOT ever want to go back to, but also something I want to keep up front to remember what it really did do to my life and the depths it brought me down to. The junkie-life in Scotland, is the same there, as it is here or anywhere else in the world for that matter. The movie doesn't flinch from depicting the horrid consequences of heroin use, but it never lets you forget that most people do it because it feels better than anything else. It's surrealistic and speedy, in a rock video kind of way. It approachs the dead-end scene of heroin use.The movie is NOT for everyone. And as I read from one reviewer, probably not for most. But if you are interested about what this does to ones life, or have a friend or family member hooked on it, it's a good movie depicting what these people go through on a day to day basis. Highly Recommended
6304884419|5.0|This film was absolutely fantastic, this is EXACTLY the kind of material my Media Studies teacher would love, its not a boring film that goes from good to bad and a happy ending. Its realistic. Ive never felt so obliged after a film to write a review, but this film was so good i just had to. The Newspapers gave it 3 stars, and their information about it was totally wrong! This really is a must see film, after seeing it on TV last-night i just have to buy it and show my friends and my Media Studies teacher. I just sat there and was thinking &quot;Yes, this is excelent&quot;, which IS so true.<BR>Watch, buy, rent this film, it is so good, you can't miss it.
1558908382|4.0|This is one of my favorite movies of all time, and (as far as I'm concerned) quintessential Cusack--mostly subtle between bursts of noise, melancholy yet ultimately upbeat.  I love Cusack as a hit man--not because he seems like an obvious person to play a hitman, but because he seems like the last person in the world to play a hitman, and that's perfect for his apologetic-yet-defensive hitman character in the movie.  I should also say that the soundtrack works PERFECTLY, and is worthwhile in its own right.  I've never been a fan of Minnie Driver, but he's not horrible as the love interest in this movie, and Dan Akroyd (who I'm not normally a huge fan of, either) works as a hitman trying to get Cusack's character to join his hitman union (or else).  A movie full of quirky, underplayed fun.

B00005JLEU|5.0|...this movie was like Alice in Wonderland written while on acid... well, Lewis Carroll WAS on acid while writing that.<br />Anyway, this movie is great.  Probably the best animated film I've ever seen, definitely blows away just about everything Disney has ever done.

B00001MXXH|5.0|Although most of the stars of this classic teen comedy flick are now long gone or just aren't as sparkly as they were when this mvoie was released, Ferris Bueller's Day Off is still the best comedy movie of the dreadful 80's. Jeffrey Jones's Ed Rooney character is the highlight as the school dean who gets his ... kicked, ripped and bitten by everything and everybody except the one person whose driving him nuts, Mathew Broderick's Ferris Bueller. Alan Ruck's Cameron Frye is the legendary character that each person relates to, absolutely hilarious in the most \\"depressing\\" way...and i do mean that in a good funny sense. Mia Sara's Sloane Peterson is the sweetie pie that not only Ferris wanted to marry, Edie Mcclurg as the dean's secretary will make you crack more laughs than the number of pencils in her hair...and let's not forget Jennifer Grey's Jeanie Bueller, the jealous bitchy sister who falls in love with a drugged out loser played by Charlie Sheen in the funniest cameo appearance ever.<br />This is one of my favorite comedies of all time...despite the features which only include director John Hughes shot by shot commentary, the DVD quality of this classic is worth the while.<br />Now don't tell me that you can't hear Wayne Newton's \\"Danka Shane\\" and the Beatles' \\"Twist and Shout\\" playing in your head!<br />own it now!
B00005JKZT|5.0|\\"The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers\\" is in every way a worthy continuation of Peter Jackson's adaptation of the Tolkien trilogy. Just as finely wrought as \\"The Fellowship of the Rings,\\" yet even more fiercely dramatic, \\"The Two Towers\\" hurls us into the action where the first movie left off, with the fellowship scattered in different directions. Jackson moves gracefully between the three parallel stories, giving the audience just enough time to catch its breath before the next dazzling set piece. Particularly dazzling are the Battle of Helm's Deep, a thrilling extravaganza that takes up the film's last hour, and the character of Gollum, simultaneously hideous, sinister and pitiful, a brilliant collaboration between actor Andy Serkis and Jackson's crackerjack team of computer artists. The special effects are state-of-the-art; the actors show superb teamwork, all holding up their ends while modestly serving the purposes of Jackson and Tolkien. Once again Jackson makes unobtrusive but definite changes to Tolkien's story, particularly in the form of some romantic complications for Aragorn (Tolkien, as everyone knows by now, fastidiously avoided the mushy stuff). But Jackson's choices are always astute, serving to open up the story cinematically and make it play better to a movie audience. Once again, Jackson is particularly careful to preserve Tolkien's moral vision--namely, that there are clear choices between good and evil, and that the will to wield power is the will to do evil. There are enough parallels between the action of \\"The Two Towers\\" and the current world situation to give us pause, just as there were between \\"The Lord of the Rings\\" and the insanity of the world wars Tolkien himself lived through. Tolkien always denied any intentions of allegory, and indeed he didn't need allegory; all he needed was insight into human character. Combining this with masterful scholarship and an agile imagination, he created a fantasy world unique in 20th-century literature. Jackson, in turn, has paid marvelous cinematic tribute to this fantasy world, far above what any audience could expect.e.

B00006J9OT|5.0|I'm a 14 year old sax player but this is the CD that sits in my CD player (no sax on record - except last studio track). It has this uncanny way of lifting me up. You can just feel the emotion and you hear her maturity. I've always been into \\"live\\" recordings because you can hear the musician's ability to \\"hang\\" and this one just oozes the \\"groove\\"...man, I am a new fan and pray she comes to Texas. My dad plays jazz guitar and I turned him onto Anthony Wilson. Anthony knows how to fit in with the piano (not an easy thing to do) - his licks and comps are so tasteful - just right for this type of music. Diana's touch on the keys is masterful - mainstream with just the right mix of chording and single lines. You can hear her really getting into each note...that's what it's all about! Adam
B00005JL96|5.0|I thought that Lilo and Stich was one of the best movies to come out this year animation wise. The story of how the two sisters have to take care of one another while under the watchful eye of the caseworker gave the film a sense of reality. Stich was kind of a strange character and was hard to get into until the middle of the film when his being there was revealed.<BR>I think it gives the viewer the meaning of family and i would buy this film before Disney pulls it at the end of Jan. You won't regret it
B00005YW4H|5.0|There are a lot of very lauding reviews of this album everywhere. The only thing I can add to the canon is that Norah Jones has the ability to relax and excite the listener within the same song. She is wise beyond her years.<br />If you like female vocalists, you will like Norah. Check out Holly Cole also if you have never heard her.
B00007BHOE|5.0|I have never had the pleasure of seeing Slipknot live, so I was really exicited about a live DVD coming out. Especially with a whole second disc with a collection of their vidios, some I have never seen before, and the bonus track &quot;purity&quot; thats amazing, I had also never heard before.  DTS would have been top of the line sound, but the standard 5.1 does the job fine. I must add how good of a job the music comes across live on this DVD.  Sometimes players have a hard time keeping up the hectic pace of their studio work, especially in this field of music, and slipknot not only keep up but play with  with more vicious intensity than you hear on the record if you can believe it. Coreys double bass playing is incredibly accurate as ever. You gotta buy this DVD and hear it for your self! Not for the weak hearted. If your 555 then i'm 666!  -RockSteady!
B000002U8A|5.0|There has been much praise for this third Duran Duran album but Also, much criticism that I believe to be unfounded and unfair. I suppose it was inevitable. This album came not too long after Rio, the album that made the band a household name in the 80's. I am not writing this in any way to criticise Rio because that album is by far one of the best of the 80's and you really cannot go wrong with it--and I myself love it, but I feel that because of the popularity of that album, Seven tends to get overlooked and is constantly seen in the shadow of Rio.<br />The Similarities: I think what I like best about Duran Duran is the ambiance and feel that you get from the music; Lush, tropical and exotic pop pleasure. And I'm not just talking about the music videos because I have never seen any of the videos for this album but that feel is evident in the sound presented on this album. The same mysterious and sometimes eerie feeling that Rio gave you ( &quot;The Chauffeur&quot;, &quot;Last chance on the stairway&quot; ) is also present here ( &quot;Tiger Tiger&quot; &quot;The seventh stranger&quot; ). Those who enjoyed &quot; Hungry like the wolf &quot; and &quot;Rio&quot; for their pure 80's pop sound will probably enjoy this album immensely.<br />The differences: Rio is definately more artsy than Seven.Other than their two biggest hits, The songs are lyricly deeper and the sound is less conventional than what you'd expect if you compared those two singles or anything on this album with The other songs on that album.In other words, if you were to take all of the songs from each album and put them on the radio at the time of this release ( 1983 ), the songs on this album would be much more popular because they fit the decade better. Many might find that this album is so &quot;POP&quot; that it has no substance to it; this is untrue. Simon's vocals vocals shine on &quot;New moon on monday&quot; and bubble gum pop artists would not be so creative or inspired to make &quot;The seventh Stranger&quot;; the best track on the album which is NOT a simple pop song but truly a sensitive and melancholy ballad with thoughtful, original lyrics to back it up. <br />Reasons why you should buy this: 1. Does &quot;The reflex&quot; ring a bell? That big hit did NOT come from Rio by the way... 2. This is the last album with all of the original line-up together. 3. This is the end of the early era( The best in my opinion ) of Duran Duran. 4. This is your best choice of all DD albums for pop lovers and those who seek GOOD 80's pop music with innovative sound. 5. If you already own Rio, DON'T snub this one; you'll regret it!
B00004X0ER|5.0|This album just plain rocks. I was skeptical of The Hives at first, because I was sick of people compairing all of those &quot;The bands&quot; that the mainstream has recently decided to pay attention to. Don't listen to the critics, check these guys out.<BR>They are completely doing their own thing. Of course there will be bands out there that might have a few similar elements to their music, but every band has that. It's not fair that they got swept into the wave of *gasp* what's &quot;trendy&quot; right now. The Hives have a lot more to offer than 'Hate To Say I Told You So'.

B00000055E|4.0|Came out in 1997, the records were recorded during the years around \\"Strictly\\" time. I didn't get this until last year because I couldn't find it anywhere and it took me a while to grow up on it and after all these months, I finally did. Since it came out in 1997, it leaves me asking the question why its releases were never featured on 2pac's Greatest Hits album. After all, the releases he released were all great tracks and deserved to be on his Greatest Hits album. Many people didn't like this track because it sounded different from all of 2pac's other work but to me, it sounded like the work 2pac would usually do, just in his younger days. This CD provides many great unreleased tracks that are groovy to listen and dance to and has the most party tracks I've seen 2pac release on an album. Some of my classics on this are- Hellrazor, I Wonder If Heaven Got a Ghetto, Nothing to Lose (the best song on the CD), Lie to Kick It, Hold On Be Strong, Fake Ass Bithes, Do for Love, Nothin but Love, When I Get Free II and Only Fear of Death. I would recommend this to true 2pac fans as it will take a while to grow on it since its the present, not the past (many people don't really like listening to old music now but I find I enjoy it) but it is definately worth a listen. Peace to Rap's finest rapper, R.I.P.
B00006BTCA|5.0|What can be said that hasn't already been said about this album?  It is my favorite of 2002, if not the past five years or so.  This album is what &quot;alternative&quot; guitar-based music has been missing for some time.  Yes, yes, they are obviously influenced by Joy Division - a good thing if you ask me, except that they build on that structure and take it further.  What really stands out on this album is the guitar work.  The guitars soar to new heights with Kessler's haunted vocals.  Many of the songs will beautifully remind you of the groundbreaking bands of the 70's and 80's, while pushing into new, original ground backed by great lyrics and original, dreamy tunes like &quot;Hands Away&quot; and &quot;Stella...&quot;.  This album is a must.

You think that the first track is starting out with some arty studio sounds or random tuning or something, but the whole album sounds like that.  If your favorite part of classical music concerts is when everyone is tuning up at the same time before the show, then by all means, pick this up.  Otherwise, don't waste your time.

B00003CXXM|5.0|I love action films that actually have a riviting plot and good acting.  This film fulfilled all of my wishes.  I loved it so much that I went and saw it again.  I later read the book, which was incredibly different than the movie.  Personally, I liked the book a lot more.  It is pretty big but so riviting that it will go so quickly.  I just bought the rest of the Bourne Trilogy.  I hope that they make the next two books into movies.  Get this movie, and the book.  The book is not a substitute for the film, and the movie does not take the place of the book.  They are both so good!

Maybe it's got something to do with the new members, but they haven't added anything fresh to the mix.<br />While Noel's lyrics would never make you mistake him for a poet, they were fun (Shakermeker, Live Forever, Roll With It, etc..).  Now he seems to have used his ideas up, and delivers a simple rehash of prior work.  Liam should stick to the pipes.  His writing is basic at best.  I'm actually suprised at how bad this and the last (Standing on the Shoulders..) albums are and that Noel and the gang didn't try harder.  Simply put, this album makes me actually more fond of &quot;Be Here Now.&quot;  Shocking.  What's happened to these guys?!?!<br />If you're new to the band, you may want to try Definetly Maybe, What's the Story.., or the b-side collection: The Masterplan before this one.  Also, skip the live album, it has a very bad mix.  I was at one of the shows and it sisn't transfer well.

630428540X|5.0|This is a very deep movie and worth viewing for people wanting to understand the elector- magnatism of this plant and the people therin.  A must for questers!!
B00000K3D4|5.0|This film is one of my favorite films.  It is a Lucasfilm directed by Jim Henson and starring David Bowie. I originally purchased it on VHS.  <br />The widescreen DVD version is outstanding.  The picture is absolutely beautiful.  Widescreen is a must for this film.  Without it, you lose much of the depth and atmosphere.  Even the beginning credits are better with widescreen.<br />The DVD contains the making of the film.  Usually, I don't care for this, however, the making of Labyrinth was very good.<br />I have a library of about 500 DVDs and 2000 VHS.  This film is one of my top 10.
B000021XS0|5.0|Petrucci and Portnoy are both amazing musicians, but previous DT albums were boring and somehow flawed in my eyes (possibly because of lame keyboard players).  This one is awesome.  I think Rudess must have helped with the compositions because all of the songs have really tight and catchy progressions not previously seen in DT.  His layers of synth flesh out the sound and really up the production quality.  One complaint is that LaBrie needs to have his balls reattached.  His singing .....  I know he has a great vocal range but his whiny feminine voice annoys everyone I know (including myself).<BR>Bottom Line:  buy this if you like extremely complex music (metal in particular) meticulously composed and performed by outstanding musicians
B00005RIKI|5.0|When an album features &quot;Tuesday's Gone,&quot; &quot;I Ain't The One,&quot; &quot;Simple Man,&quot; &quot;Gimme Three Steps,&quot; and &quot;Free Bird,&quot; how could it NOT get five stars? Add another little-known classic, &quot;Things Goin' On,&quot; to that list, and it starts to look like a very impressive album. And it is.<br />Skynyrd's debut album is at best fantastic and at worst great. It is almost a greatest hits album, with the impressive track list, and virtually all of the songs are classics. As an introduction to Skynyrd, this album works as well as a compilation -- you get most of the good stuff here, anyway!<br />A true rock classic that deserves 5 stars as much as any of the all-time classic rock albums out there.
B00005QXXO|4.0|Quite why Radiohead are releasing a live album now, hard on the heels of their second studio album in as many years, is a mystery. You can't imagine Thom Yorke wants a slice of the lucrative pre-Christmas market, although he has said that he only undertook the recent spate of interviews because he needs to make enough money to move his family to the moon!<br />What's more likely is that 'I Might Be Wrong' is Radiohead trashing the notion that 'Kid A' and 'Amnesiac' were difficult and sterile studio bound affairs. 'The National Anthem' positively swings live, buzzing with an energy that's anything but wilfully avant guarde, while 'Morning Bell' is vibrant and compelling, building up to the \\"walking walking walking\\" coda with the kind of loose chemistry that only happens onstage.<br />In some cases, hearing the songs live can help you make sense of the recorded versions. 'Idioteque', greeted by a huge cheer and accompanied by a mass singalong, is miles away from the 'Kid A' version. On record, the track is jarring and harsh, but live it's hypnotic, celebratory even. <br />'Like Spinning Plates' also benefits hugely. Stripped of the backwards special effects and pared down to Thom's voice and a piano, the track is achingly beautiful and bound to haunt you for aeons to come. You can also make out the words for the first time, giving yet more insight into the song and proving that these compositions can work on a purely emotional level if only you let them.<br />Of most interest, though, is the previously unreleased 'True Love Waits'. One of Radiohead's oldest unrecorded songs and a live favourite, it drifts along on a casually strummed acoustic and a surprisingly calm Thom, and feels like a rare moment of contentment until you hit the line \\"I'm not living/I'm just killing time\\". <br />Ironically, though, it's missing the electronic backing that made the song so hypnotic on earlier bootlegs. Don't worry. Now you've got your head round everything, a full on beats'n'bleepslive album is bound to be released the week after next.
B00000JNO2|4.0|This album, as many have said, isn't Skynyrd's best. Skynyrd at their worst would destroy most bands, though.<br />There are some real classics here, and some of it comes pretty close to being filler. It is all, however, good to listen to, and it's not an album you'll soon tire of.<br />If you're looking for hard rock, Skynyrd style, this isn't the album for you. They rock for some of it, but a lot of it is acoustic. It's great, but it gets away from the trademark Skynyrd sound -- which is the hard rockin' sound.<br />It gets 4 stars. It's a great album, really, but it doesn't seem quite as great when you compare it to their other stuff. If you're a Skynyrd fan, you'll love it, but if you're just getting into the band, check out the other albums first. This album doesn't have the same sort of &quot;fun&quot; rock as the other albums -- it certainly has a more serious edge, and the lyrics are deeper.
B00005RY7X|3.0|What kind of cynical so-and-so enjoys bursting the glistening bubble of promise? It's not a pleasurable past-time by any means. But hell, people have a right to know. Ladies and gentlemen, Andrew W.K. is distinctly, definitely, decidedly average.<br />The 22-year-old NYC geezer with the bloody nose has had his hairy, hedonistic metal-pop hyped to high heaven. Current single 'Party Hard' is moshing mentally around the UK Top Twenty right now. And debut album 'I Get Wet' features another eleven identikit tracks - over a gloriously brief 35 minutes.<br />Jim Bob and Fruitbat may feel that a comeback is in the offing after listening to this. For where Carter USM would harness their superior synthy beats to edgy punk rock guitars and caustic kitchen sink lyrics, Mr W.K. chooses metal/goth/glam riffing and &quot;live hard&quot; lyrics on songs such as 'It's Time To Party', 'Party Til You Puke', 'Fun Night' and 'Don't Stop Living In The Red'.<br />Sticking to the same relentless pace throughout, W.K. and his karaoke Marilyn Manson growl conjure up thoughts of Van Halen, Zodiac Mindwarp, Gary Glitter, Pop Will Eat Itself, The Ramones and Slayer. Hell, there's even a bit of Terrorvision in there too.<br />Not rock's latest saviour then but a young chap with a lot of energy, a few catchy anthemic tunes and a lust for life. By the way... W supposedly stands for 'the world of strength and unity, the shape of two arms locked in unwielding power', while K represents 'the consumption of the universe', the continuous symbol of greater than, less than, always level'. Hmmm, bubble barely intact then... party hard dudes!
B000067CPX|4.0|The Red Hot Chili Peppers have been accused of much softening up over the years; fair enough, but I don't think they are any worse off for it as a band. In fact, I may very well prefer the more reserved nature of By The Way to the relentlessness of Blood Sugar Sex Magik...yes, I said *prefer.* When hearing the singles By The Way and The Zephyr Song on the radio I can tell that they don't work nearly as well in that setting as they do on the album, which is a rare case indeed. Then to be trumped by songs like Can't Stop and Minor Thing, that are truer to the RHCP you used to know, only makes this latest release by the boys of groove that much better. Who says the contemplative can't be better than the aggravated?
B00005QAPH|4.0|This is my first experience with Fellini.  In my college days, I often heard the expression, \\"You don't have to be Fellini to figure that one out,\\" and am only now coming to realize what that meant.  Fellini is fearless in exploring the most difficult questions, like one's sexual honesty, the ability of anyone to \\"tell the whole truth\\" to the public when one is less than honest with onesself, and what level of certainty one must have in order to instruct others.  If these questions seem a bit obtuse -- they are.  Yet, I defy anyone to show these most primal of subjects addressed in American films.  At least Fellini addresses them with a sense of humor, without losing his emotional or physical passion, and with images that will stay with you for many days after viewing this film.<br />The clarity of picture and sound are impressive.  It is a rather \\"honest\\" portrayal of a movie director with the cinematic equivalent of writer's block.  On first viewing, I must confess that I missed some of the Italian cultural references, of which I was informed by watching the movie with the running commentary (top notch).  But here is the real rub on this one -- this movie is worth owning for the extras.  These are contained on a separate disk, and merit watching over and over and over again.  The interview with Sandra Milo (Fellini's mistress of some 17 years) is worth the price of the DVD set alone.  The hour-long documentary made by Fellini himself contains clips of movies that never made it into production and, for me, represent the ultimate in entertainment value.  So, even if the subject matter of 8 1/2 does not sound like your cup of Chianti, buy it for the extras alone.  You will want it if you enjoy any of Fellini's other films.
B00006F83Y|4.0|QOTSA are a band whose albums I want to like more than I actually ever do. They are like the second coming of Faith No More or something, but I think Faith No More might have come better the first time. I do not mean to say that the Queens are in any way bad, because there isn't a single weak album on my top 15 this year (and there are really 17). However, I have gone back and forth between whether some of the songs on this album are filler or not and ultimately decided that a couple were. What isn't filler? Well: first and foremost Dave Grohl's drumming on any of the album (but especially at the end of Song For The Dead), the album all the way up to the amazingly screamed Six Shooter (give me more Nick, baby!) and none of the last five songs of the album, especially not the bonus track. Meaning, there is a little downtime in the middle, but it's not down enough to where it's unlistenable. Your best bet is to buy it if you already know you like the Queens Of The Stone Age.
B00005RFQ5|4.0|This CD is far different than his earlier work, which is what makes it so unique.  It is the kind of CD that makes you LISTEN to the music.  Once again, Prince has triumphed!
B00006690G|4.0|Eminem is vastly talented; if you disagree with that I reserve the right to throw you out of my choice of moving automobile. That aside I can understand the various reasons why people don't like him, but I'm in it for his sheer talent and his ability to continuously get under the skin of anyone who is looking for a reason to be offended. There was no way he could have possibly come back with a better album than 2000's The Marshal Mathers LP and so he didn't even try. Instead, he went in a different direction and it worked just as well for him as about anything would have. On The Eminem Show he really does do a play of sorts where he raps to somewhat conceptual beats and with a variety of different lyrical deliveries. It's not the same Marshal Mathers vs. Slim Shady, evil vs. slightly more evil shtick he ran on his first two albums (light comic on SSLP and dark comic on MMLP) and it's nice to have a change. Even if he *is* just learning to work outside the box and it may be a couple more albums before he delivers one even close to successful as his second. Then again, if Lose Yourself (from the 8 Mile sdtk) is any indication, it may only take one.
6304578482|5.0|this movie is so much fun i am a huge fan of lisa kudrow
B000002MG1|5.0|I wouldn't exactly call myself a big fan of REM's music but in the past couple of years, I started changing my mind about their music (I used to think that they were highly overrated). It was their last studio album \\"Reveal\\", particularly \\"Imitation of Life\\" that changed everything that I thought about the band. I immediately fell in love with Beach Boys-esque sounds of \\"Reveal\\" and the lushness of \\"Up\\". At a recommendation of an aquaintence of mine, I thought I would check out their much heralded \\"Automatic For the People\\". I remember when this album first came out, I just did not care for \\"Drive\\",\\"Man On the Moon\\", and especially \\"Everybody Hurts\\". I was in high school then and was more into punk music at the time. Now I love those songs and the whole feel of this album. There is such a haunting quality to \\"Automatic For the People\\" that simply sends chills down my spine. I especially love \\"Try Not to Breathe\\" and \\"Nightswimming\\". I think those two songs are two of REM's best ballads I have ever heard. The countryish sounds of \\"The Sidewinder Sleeps Tonite\\" is absolutely incredible. The song itself is extremely catchy. I used to really despise \\"Everybody Hurts\\" but after the terrorist attacks, I find an emotional outlet in the brooding ballad. As I am listening to this album for the first time in months, I find myself falling in love again with \\"Automatic For the People\\". There is a magic and joy that I just am not hearing in today's music. \\"Automatic For the People\\" will never sound dated. Ten years later, it still sounds fresh and invigorating to listen to at night.
B00005V3Z4|5.0|Ok the director made a flaw when he mentioned cellardoor. I loved his mentioning it but his mistake came when he went on to assume that it was edgar allen poe that made the comment, in all actuality it was JRR Tolkien who made this comment. Tolkien was the great linguist who actually created his own languages. Poe was a poet. So if you read this then now you know. So the movie is great. It made me think. I generally like doing such activities. You got this kid who sees the future with his powers and \\"unconsciously knows\\" he's going to die. He wants to change the way things will be and uses his powers to do so by keeping himself from dying the fateful nite. He does this by creating an alternate course of time where he is not in his bed when a jet engine crashes on top of it. So he's always sneaking out of his room at nite on the off beat chance that nite is the fateful nite. Then you have this old lady who also has these powers and writes a book on it and she wants things set right and put back in order, and she does this unconsciously as well by causing Frank to accidently kill Gretchen by unconsciously always being in the middle of the road. I guess Lady Death \\"unconsciously knows\\" this will help Donnie make everything right. The kid sees that he has to change things back to how everything was supposed to be (where he dies)and makes the jet engine of his mom's airplane fall into a portal which he creates for the engine to go back in time and fall on himself 28 days from the 30th. How the jet engine ever initially falls is beyond me but according to time theory if you have an 8 ball go through a portal to the past then that 8 ball will always have gone into the portal and always come out at the other end of the portal. The thing is when it comes out in the past what changes will it make? Even if say the 8 ball runs into itself somewhere down the line that in itself may have caused the 8 ball to have gone through the time portal initially, but there is no disputing the fact that the 8 ball will have to go into the time portal and come out no matter what you try to do to stop it. The 8 ball initially always came out before the possibility of it going in is conceived. Therefore predestination exist if time travel exist. It's a law of time. If time travel itself is possible. And seeing that he actually does force the jet engine to fall on his previous self in the alternate future then this would bring an end to his alternate universe/the world. So the bunny was right all along, the world did end. The touching ending is what made it all the worthwhile. The end has the director saying that Donnie is smiling because Donnie thinks it was all just a dream. But to me Donnie was smiling because he was no longer afraid to die alone. Which if the director didn't think about seeing it that way then his ...missed a good ending call. Also from a deleted scene you have Donnie and Gretchen playing some 80s racecar game and he describes the visions he has and says they are like dreams but they are crystal clear and right when they are over just like when you wake up from a dream it all slips away little by little really quick. Well at the end you see everyone and they are all waking up from the \\"dream\\" that Donnie made, his alternate universe. And eventually they all start to forget about it. And that's why Gretchen hesitates at the end but still says that she never knew Donnie. Because to her it was all just a dream that's slipping out of hers and everyone else's memory. If you didn't know, the deleted scenes have a lot of Donnie and Gretchen together as bf/gf. And another scene that was deleted that was not even in the deleted scenes section show him and Gretchen dropping off the roberta sparrow letter. And I feel that the love story here is awesome even though they downplayed it with editing. But yeah there you go. Great ending. Loved it. All time classic movie. If i'm wrong about certain things then I don't care.
B00007E8V4|5.0|System Of A Down have created a sonic landscape that sets them apart from popular bands in music today.  Although this album wasn't ment to be released until it leaked online in may of 2002, it has proven to be an album of good songs and sonic incantations.  I own all three albums from this amazing band,<BR>their sound is unlike anything I've ever heard in music, the drums, guitar solos, bass and their lead singers voice is something strong and just musically amazing.  Buy Steal This Album and pay attention to each song, as you bare witness to album of sonic brillance.
B00005LMWI|4.0|You know how sometimes you play an album for the first time, and you realize the music isn't the most original in the world, but you still can't help banging your head like crazy because it's done so well?<br />That's Karma.<br />This was my first Kamelot album, and like I said, the music has been done before.  It's basically late-80's power metal with massively pumped-up double-bass drums and extremely clean, yet powerful, vocals.  In fact, the vocals are probably the most original part of the band.  Khan is a vet of the old prog/power band &quot;Conception,&quot; who were one of my guilty pleasures in the mid-90's.  His voice is silky-smooth, always with an air of mystery, and a range that will shame most Metal singers.  In Kamelot, he hasn't lost an inch of his considerable prowress, and actually manages to pull the band into Conception's sound briefly at times.  That's a good thing, by the way.<br />Favorite Songs from this album:<BR>1) Forever<BR>2) Wings of Despair<BR>3) Karma<BR>4) The Light I Shine On You<BR>5) Fall From Grace<BR>6) The Spell (really cool, atmospheric lead break)<br />If you want to hear Classic Metal with plenty of sonic force and great production, pick up Kamelot's Karma.  I used to love this stuff--once more on the merry-go-round is fine with me.
B00005A46T|5.0|Yall KNOW this is a wicked beyond wicked cd! We aren't talking about sissy music here. The only people listening to this stuff are people who(for the most part)understand and appreciate good hard metal! The first cd was raw and unspoiled. As their second cd, this one has the proper elements of growth, loudness, and fearlessness! They have nothing to prove to the metal community that they haven't already proven to the world. Haters...go on and keep hating! I love this cd! I unwrapped it before noon on my lunch break the day it came out and loved it from the first 2 seconds! Just for the record, \\"Skin Ticket\\" is one of the most moving songs I've EVER heard from any band...This cd rules! They don't expect to put out a myriad of cds...so...long live the sicness!! Buy this cd!
B00006JJ1O|5.0|Otchin Horosho Ladies ! \\"200 km/h in the wrong lane\\" is a bomb ... I did not hear something so incredibly refreshing since a couple of years. I discovered \\"all the things she said\\" on French TV during my Christmas vacation. The video is deliciously provocative ... This French guy is now listening to the album 24/7. Thanks Trevor Horn for the impeccable production and bolchoi spaciba Lena and Julia for the beautiful voices that mix together so nicely.
B00004U8P9|5.0|omg! this is my favorite movie of all time, and i love the special features of the dvd.
B000068TPN|5.0|Next time you want to be critical of our armed forces, watch this movie before you open your mouth. I believe everyone should have a copy at home.<br />Soldiers do what they are ordered to do. Don't blame them. A soldier's duty is unique and only in combat it becomes historical reality. This movie is about love, not hatred.<br />The greatness of Lt. Colonel Moore lies in his willinhness to respect, see and talk to his oponent, Lt. Colonel Nguyen Huu An. They got together years later, not as enemies, but as old former combatants. There was greatness on both sides.<br />A true epic of the first rank.
B00003CXTF|5.0|As a former Army nurse once stationed at a hospital near Pearl Harbor in Honolulu, I find the movie &quot;Pearl Harbor&quot; (2001), directed by Michael Bay, to be one of the best films depicting the lives of American nurses during war. The Navy Nurses in this World War II movie are seen not only as professional persons carrying out technical skills with compassion and expertise, but also as complete persons with their lives deeply affected by the Japanese bombing of Pearl Harbor and the ensuing war. Throughout the movie there are glimpses of nurses performing their many responsibilities. The nurses' lives during and before the war are realistically depicted. During the pre-war times, the nurses in New York are conducting aspects of the physical exam. Once in Honolulu at the military hospital, you find them on a quiet nursing unit. With the bombing of Pearl Harbor on the main island of Oahu, the nurses are mobilized into setting up emergency surgery and one of the very first emergency triage areas. The beautiful, caring and dedicated nurse heroine, portrayed extremely well by Kate Beckinsale, uses her lipstick to triage the critically ill and those too badly wounded to be saved. The nurses are depicted as skilled, brave, professional and intelligent. Beckinsale's character saves the life of a major with her finger by pressing a bleeding artery during the bombing, and because of this heroism is able to obtain information about the two men she loves who are engaged in the Doolittle Raid in Japan. No one is spared from the ravages of war. One of the nurses is killed during the bombing. As the Japanese admiral stated early in the movie, a brilliant man figures out how to resolve conflicts without a horrible war killing so many.
B00005QDW1|4.0|I give this album a rating of 4 stars mostly because of the first six tracks; after that, it is mostly ho-hum with a few good ones. My most favorite track is 'Making Out', which is so much fun I can't help but dance and sing along to it each time I hear it. The lyrics are great, too - one gets a great sense of what Gwen Steffani was feeling and thinking to the point where the visuals are chrystal clear. Another highlight is 'Hella Good', a bass-driven, breathy, sweaty dance song with a pulse that gets those hips going voluntarily. 'Underneath It All' is a precious moment that sees a woman recounting the different aspects of her relationship and deciding that love ultimately conquers all. 'Hey Baby' is quite a funny look at the life of rock stars, especially through the eyes of a girl watching the guys in her band with groupies. It's another great dance track. 'Detecvtive' is one of the quirkiest songs on the album, and one of my favorites. The clever, clipped lyrics keep the song going, especially the chorus which is charming and very emotionally bearing. Steffani definately lays it all out there in this song, and the musical composition adds considerably to the modd. I seriously have listened to the first six songs on this album non-stop since I bought it, and I feel it was money well spent.
0780631684|4.0|Much, much better than I anticipated.  I expected a corny schlocky teen flick (and there is some of that) but it is so creepily done that the thrills outweigh the drawbacks in this one.  Basically, the gang is marked for death - they know it and we know it.  The thrills come into play with the when and the how.  Wong TEASES us to death with this part of the film. Great, elaborate teases arise as each character meets his/her doom. Most of the tension comes from the set-ups and they are very well done. Fun, effective and eerie.  Recommended.
B0000640VO|2.0|It's forever a sunny day in Paris of Amelie.  The streets and subways are immaculately clean, with no urban problems of graffiti, cars, noise - or any of those darned people of color.  The weirdoes that populate the beautiful subway are merely shy, handsome, eccentric guys that collect discarded photo booth pictures to ponder who the souls are.<br />I have no objections to fantasies, to optimistic tales that say, hey, life is wonderful.  We have friends, sunsets, and puppy dogs.  How can you not be thrilled to live?  But the reality in the life of Amelie is whitewashed, computer generated and enhanced.  The result is a cynical underlying underpinning.  Amelie's world creators lack the depth to the see the glass as half-full and see joy in the mundane.  Instead of seeing the silver lining to the cloud, this movie creates a beautiful fantasy cloud.  Instead of seeing the glass as half full, it fills the glass to the top.<br />The movie begins with a wonderful 20-minute voice-over that gives a capsule of her life - from the suicidal goldfish episode to the ice-cold father who touched Amelie only during his heart-checkups.   Later, she talks of the joys in noticing details in movies that she believes nobody else notices, like the bug in the background of an old black and white movie that enters the open lips of a woman about to kiss.  She also talks of the small pleasures in her life, like skipping stones in the lake.  She's had a couple boyfriends who failed to interest her.  Amelie develops something of a Walter Mitty fantasy life.<br />It all reminds me of a certain person I once knew, and it is all to character.  <br />But the movie goes downhill after the voice-over.  She meets the quirky, handsome, eccentric boy through an elaborate game she devises (\\"follow les arrows ...\\").  In the end, she finally hooks up, they have an elaborately choreographed neck-kissing scene, and the next scene is of a naked Amelie and eccentric guy.  Amelie is finally happy.<br />That'sthe happy ending.  Instead of learning confidence or something worthwhile, or saying something insightful to the viewer, she has to be with a guy and have sex upon first meeting.  It's trite, doesn't quite follow the character, and is a further distortion of reality.<br />I found this movie offensive, and I don't say that too often.
B00005JL96|5.0|A young Hawaiian girl adopts a pet who is actually an alien fugitive from the law.  This short description doesn't do this movie justice.  This is probably one of the most inventive Disney originals in a long time.  Highly enjoyable for both children and adults.<br />The characters are almost real.  You can believe that Nani and Lilo have gone through many troubles in their life.  The interaction between Nani and Lilo are very close to what real people would actually do.  That makes Nani (and thus Lilo) more realistic and more believable.  Nani's bit about \\"gravity increasing\\" makes you believe that she's just a kid at heart with more responsibilities than she may be able to handle yet.  And Lilo reading to Stitch was just precious.<br />The characters are fantastic.  \\"Cobra Bubbles\\" indeed.  Some of the \\"in\\" jokes may go over younger viewers heads, but older viewers in the audience, and certainly the adults, will be laughing along with the kids, just for different reasons.  Watch for the sequences about the mosquito - you will absolutely die laughing when you get to the punchline.<br />Even the main character's name - \\"Stitch\\" - suggests something that was sewn together out of parts and pieces.  Older adults will appreciate the use of Elvis tunes throughout the movie to illustrate main points.  Watching Stitch imitate Elvis was one of the better bits.<br />And the dialog in the movie is fantastic.  The scriptwriters deserve a hearty congratulations for coming up with some of the most memorable lines that have been used in cartoon movies recently.  Examples include: \\"No more caffeine for you.\\"  \\"Nah, the manager's a vampire.  He wanted me to join his Legion of the Undead.\\"  \\"Oh, good; my dog found the chainsaw.\\"  \\"So far, you have been adrift in the sheltered harbor of my patience, but I cannot ignore you being jobless.  In case you're wondering, this did not go well.  You have three days to change my mind.\\"<br />But it's \\"Stitch\\" that steals the show.  Even in the commercials for this movie, you knew \\"Stitch\\" wasn't going to be one of the Disney heroes we have come to expect.  He starts out so bad - whatever he says at the start of the movie was so terrible that it makes some council members faint, and even a robot throws up.  But by the conclusion of the movie he grows into the role of a hero - and that makes him one of the more believable Disney heroes in a =long= time.  Stitch also becomes more like a person in that time - making him even more believable as a character and as a person in his own right.<br />And the message is equally important.  \\"Family means never being left behind - or forgotten.\\"  Sure, it's one of the messages that Disney is known for promoting.  But it is presented the best when Stitch finally realizes that it means something important to him.  And the family that Stitch knows is preserved.  Perseverance pays.  It is -how- that family is preserved by Stitch that makes this move special.<br />This film is presented in the time honored frame-by-frame animation technique - a technique that often gets forgotten in these days of computer animation.  Sure the visuals may look a little simple - but that's part of the joy of the old frame-by-frame animation process.  And the characters look more real.  Nani looks a -lot- like what a young Hawaiian woman would look like.  Lilo looks like a kid.

B00005NC66|3.0|This movie gets very irritating after a time. True, Jean Seberg is stunning in her portrayal of a young woman without roots whose survival instincts are finely honed. True, there are attractive moments in Godard's cinema verite style. But the situations are so boring and the lead male character so vacuous that it is hard not to get irritated. One reviewer praised Godard for spending a half hour with the couple lounging around in her bed. Boring, boring, and finally, irritating. Try the 400 Blows -- similar style but a really interesting, even gripping, story.
B000069HK2|2.0|The used are great, there very melodic and...heavy yay! I didnt like em at first, then I listened to &quot;A box full of sharp objects&quot;, and i was like &quot;wow:)&quot;. There great, except they sound like something done before. There are 2 flaws about the band: 1.the singer screams to much at the wrong places 2. the lead singer went out with Kelly Osbourne (sad, very sad). uhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh great band, and EMO RULES! p.s. BUY IT !

0767802470|5.0|This is an excellent DVD. I really liked the story, except the end is really sad; it is really hard to see the submarine crew die during a massive air raid without being able to do anything about it, especially after all the skills and courage they had displayed before, while they were very successfully fighting against all kinds of odds in their submarine. Apart from the sadness resulting from the last scene, the rest of the movie is really excellent; the actors are good, the atmosphere of the movie is nice, the pace is fine, the suspense is excellent etc. I do not recommend the french translation though.
6303614493|5.0|The characters in this movie must had used bad lanuage about 10 to 20 times in an hour and 41 minutes. You have a dad, and his daughter, 4 ghosts, a mad woman and a man that  her partner. Or whatever he is. How much more fun do you need? Of course for some reason this movie has not been released on dvd? But maybe soon the company of this film made decide to bring Casper on dvd. When Casper opens, a lady named Carrigan Crittender (Cathy Moriarty) is ferious to learn that her dead father has only left her a mansion named Whappistaff. She even yells at her partner named Dibs (Eric Idle). They take for for Maine and learn all by themselves that the house is haunted by a freindly ghost named Casper (Malaoni Pearson), his grumpy uncles Stretch (Joe Nipate), Stinkie (Joe Alaskey) and Fatso (Brad Garrett). So when the 3 out of 4 ghosts scare away people she hired to get rid of the ghosts, she decides to have the place torn down but again the ghosts scare away the workers. Until one day when Casper sees a story on Hardcopy about a ghost psychiatrist named Dr. James Harvery (Bill Pullman) and his daughter Kat Harvey (Christina Ricci) and quicky disappears and puts the story on in Carrigan's hotel room where she calls the town that Jmaes Harvey and Kat are currently in and hires James to take a try iof rid the masnion of the ghosts, but doesn like his weeks or years reply on how long it should approzimatly take.<br />If you love movies that was children's animated shows, I reccomemd you to watch Casper. Plus if you are a fan of either Mr. Rogers, Ben Stein, Rodney Dangerfield, or Mel Gibson, they all pretty much has apparances in the movie. Or had apparances if thier scenes were deleted from the film. I know for sure you can see both Mr. Rogers and Ben Stein are dentifly seen in this movie. Here are some of my thougths on Casper. If you love movies with songs in it, you will be disappointed to learn that there are only 5-6 songs in Casper including a Frank Sintra song called &quot;That's Life.&quot; Plus you got the song Casper the freindly ghost performed by Little Richard. But I won't reccomend this movie to yong kids (like maybe under 5 or 6) because there may be scenes in this movie that may scare them.quot;That's Life.&quot; Plus you got the song Casper the freindly ghost performed by Little Richard.

0066214122|5.0|This was another awesome book from Micheal Crichton. I love the way Crichton writes because he takes a concept that is very complex and hard to understand and is able to make me understand all while telling a great story. Fans of Crichton will not be let down but the thrilling story that deals with nanotechnology. I like what this book has to say about not putting regulations on technology and the ramifications it can have on society. I read this book in about three days I could not put it down and neither will you.
B00005JL96|1.0|Although I am old enough for not going ga-ga over animated movies, I still enjoy them, I liked Ice Age a lot, Shrek was wonderful, Monsters,Inc was also of my liking, but this lame pice of garbage was terrible. First of all, I think the film was a terrible example for children, why, oh let me think, the two main characters were a pair of good for nothing creatures, Lilo was a spoiled brat who did anything she wanted and here shield was that her parents were dead, come on, so if a kids parents die that means the kid is free to do as she wants and get what she wants, she was a destructive and stupid girl that thought she was so cool just for liking Elvis, so,not that I hate Elvis, he Is the King of Country, which I enjoy, but that was a very lame addition to this already wreck of a film. And the second character, Stitch was a destructive and vicious animal that looked like he had some sort of disease, I still think he should be put down by a vet or something. This characters are \\"wonderful\\" role-models for children right. In a time when children are growing more and more dumb and spoiled, do we really need to encourage it even more. I think Disney has lost all of its once wonderful quality, Disney was so desperate of getting people to like this movie so they put in the trailer all of the GOOD movies of the past like The Lion King(the best animated of all time) and Beauty and the Beast(the second) and made it look like if Lilo & Stitch was a spoof, thats why I went to see it, then I saw it, and I went out feeling angry because I spend almost two hours of my life seeing this \\"movie\\". Everything in it was awful, the story, the characters, the lame and stupid lines and etc. This \\"film\\" made it look to kids that the best and only way to be was to be like Lilo & Stitch, my little cousin tried to adopt the style of living of thoose two stupid characters, Disney must remember that children get very infuenced by tv and films and if they imitate the behaviour they see, I have seen it happen many times, and do you parents think is correct to condone indicipline, destructiveness and all of the things that were gloryfied in Lilo & Stitch, you may find it amussing, but kids will make it their way of life. If this film wins best animated movie in the Oscars I will really be upset and don't see more of the awards because any person or group of people that condone honour this film don't know anything about movies, I do, I have studied filmaking, and have watched many films, I'm no master, but I know a little, and that is enough to see that this is junk, worst than junk but I cant curse here, so please, See Spirit:Stallion of the Cimarron rather than this, because I think that Lilo & Stitch shows most of the many things that are wrong with the world and encourages these mischiefs.
B00001IVOR|4.0|i would just like to remind everyone that this album had a lot of difficulties surrounding it...the studios that this was recorded at got flodded about 70% of the way through the recording process and they had to do allllll the track again so if there is any qualms aout the performances on this record, you now know the reason...nonetheless...its a 'bangin' cd and should be picked up!

B000001ESJ|5.0|A Farewell to Kings......Lifeson graduates! He moves from being the guitar great from Canada who did 2112 to the exclusive status of GUITAR GOD (joining Gilmour, Beck, and Page).My original exposure to this album was on 8-track. The title track opens with a classical piece which is very well done. Although Lifeson is not known for his acoustic prowess (Rush should have used the acoustic more), the song moves into a heavy riff which has Lee in perfect voice. The solo is earth shattering then immediately moves into a cut-time riff which USED to be their trademark.Xanadu shows the incredible talent of this Kid Lifeson. The intro is pure volume pedal. To young guitar players in the mid-70s, we had never heard anything like this before, or since. The song is brilliant. A reviewer stated in her review of the Odeon live version that Alex sure rocked back then. Yes he did! However, within 10 years, Lifeson would forget how to use the volume pedal, as well as the wah, and basically forget how to play guitar in general.Closer to the Heart is a bit to AM for me, maybe because radio has since worn it out (radio has a way of taking a good song and playing it into the ground...look at Sawyer and Limelight). But it gells nicely with this album. Madrigal is a soft ballad that is very well done. Many blast this song because it doesn't rock. Well, DUH! IT'S A BALLAD, MAN! Cinderella Man is probably the best song ever written by Lee. The band is absolutely tight. Cygnus closes out the album. Very strange song, LOADED with cut riffs and time-signature changes (if you like post Roll the Bones Rush with all its standard 4/4 time and melodic emptiness, then you probably won't like Cygnus). But clearly, Cygnus defines Rush as a powerhouse. All in all, a perfect album. Rush would continue its extraordinary art form for 2 more albums, culminating with the incredible Permanent Waves.

B0000797IO|4.0|\\"The Good Girl\\" is the movie that finally separates Jennifer Aniston from her \\"Friends\\" persona and shows her to be an actress of remarkable talent. She has become rich and famous due to the long running TV series [while also becoming Mrs. Brad Pitt in real life], but from her penchant for taking roles in small, independent movies, it's clear that she has been searching for artistic recognition. \\"The Good Girl\\" gives it to her in spades. <br />This is the story of a woman who has been crushed by the inertia of her life. Justine [Aniston] lives in a small, nondescript town where she works at the Retail Rodeo, a smaller, kinder version of Wal-Mart. Her husband, Phil [John C. Reilly], and his ever present best friend, Bubba [Tim Blake Nelson], paint houses by day and smoke dope by night. These guys are likable enough but choose to be on the tour bus of life, traveling day after day to nowhere. Little wonder, then, that Justine becomes fascinated by Holden [Jake Gyllenhaal], a man ten years her junior who is obsessed by the novel, \\"The Catcher in the Rye\\". They begin a serio-comic love affair that leads to disaster but not to a stereotypical cinematic conclusion. You will be left thinking about Justine and hoping that her choice was the right one.<br />The Good Girl\\" is part drama and part comedy with just the right amount of satire thrown in to keep it lively. Highly recommended for viewers who enjoy well written and acted character-driven movies.
0316666343|5.0|I just finished reading Alice Sebold's The Lovely Bones.  I do believe that this book is destined to become a classic, as a reviewer wrote on the book jacket. Our perception of heaven is challenged, and that is what makes great literature--to challenge how we see things now.   Alice Sebold writes sparingly, with every word and phrase meaning something.  The subtle nuances of life and relationships are told well.  This was the saddest book I have ever read.  It was also the most uplifting book as well. Heaven is HERE on earth, and through this story, I have learned to appreciate all that we have been given.  If you read this book, be prepared for it to engulf your life while you are reading it. The characters seem so real.  The issues in the book had closure, which helped, in the end, to  give an uplifting tone to the story.  Definitely worth the tears.
630460291X|2.0|This film is only saved by the performances of Morgan Freeman and Alan Rickman.  Micheal McShane is good as Friar Tuck, but underused.  One thing that folks around here have neglected to mention is that Costner starts out the film with a light British accent, which he loses about 5 minutes into the film.  Costner probably refused to have a dialect coach.  Robin Hood is an English character, and it might have done Costner some good to actually challenge himself for a change. <BR>In my opinion, Errol Flynn is still the definitive film Robin Hood.  Also, the British series 'Robin of Sherwood' is a marvellous version of the Robin Hood story, with much better acting than in this film.
B00005JL2O|4.0|I have to admit that all of the Austin Powers' movies are little guilty pleasures, and Goldmember is no exception.  Yes, it is filled with the typical [strange humor] comedy that made the two previous movies so popular, yet its story is unique on its own.  Mike Myers is wonderfully diverse, reprising his roles as Austin, Dr. Evil, and Fat Bastard, while introducing the new character Goldmember (a raving 70's Dutchman who eats his own dried skin...pretty wacky).  Beyonce Knowles plays a great, rather platonic sidekick, and Michael Caine is surprisingly convincing as Austin's \\"fahza\\".  <br />Many may find the family plotline in this movie rather sappy and even predictable, and the ending may leave faithful Austin devotees thinking \\"ok, now what?\\"  However, Austin is still as endearing as ever, and this movie is an adequate recovery from the rather slow \\"Spy Who Shagged Me\\".  Heck, the cameos in the intro to Goldmember alone make it a vast improvement.   <br />The infinifilm DVD format is good.  All of the trailers, including my personal favorite featuring Verne Troyer as the mini-Austin Powers, are featured, as well as deleted scenes, music videos, and \\"the making of\\" featurettes.  This DVD actually has three versions of the movie in its entirety.  The first is just the movie alone; I recommend watching this first.  The second is the movie with infinifilm features inserted (e.g., a deleted scene or a \\"how they made this scene\\" option is listed at the bottom of the screen at the point in the movie it pertained to);  these are interesting, although some are so short,  I almost wonder why they even bothered.  The third is the movie with Jay Roach (director) and Mike Myers providing commentary of the scenes throughout.  This is funny, although somewhat repetitive of the extra features on the DVD and rather self-gratifying (i.e., Mike Myers and Jay Roach tell you what a joy it was to work with everyone on the cast and how great it is that they made this movie).<br />All inall, this is a truly funny movie, and the infinifilm features definitely try and give you the inside scoop on the movie.  Although repetitive, if you really liked Goldmember, you won't mind watching it more than once.
B000005JA8|1.0|It's not that this music is hard to appreciate, it simply isn't music in the first place.
B00000AFDW|3.0|I'm a Kiss fan from way back, so I really wanted to like this album.  Unfortunately, there are only a handful of really good songs, with the rest of them somewhat below average.  For me, the standouts include the title track, \\"We Are One\\", and \\"Raise Your Glasses\\".  The only song on here that is truly awful is \\"I Finally Found My Way\\" with Peter Criss on vocals.  It feels completely out of place with the rest of the music, and seems to be another attempt to recreate the song \\"Beth\\".  As much I as love Ace Frehley's bizarre vocals, his song \\"Into the Void\\" didn't do anything for me.  Overall, the main problem with this album is that it doesn't have any direction; the band and songwriters just seem to be going through the motions.  It's unfortunate because their two previous studio albums \\"Revenge\\" and \\"Carnival of Souls\\" are both quite good.<br />Like the title says, buy it used if you must have it, but there are other Kiss albums I would recommend instead of this such as \\"Love Gun\\", \\"Dressed to Kill\\", or the first two live albums.
0140177396|3.0|&quot;Of Mice and Men&quot; by John Steinbeck is a very interesting  story where two men with different personalities live their lives in a form of a &quot;family&quot;. George and Lennie are the main characters of this story, between them exists a good balance because  George is the one who posesses the intelligece and Lennie is the one who posesses the strength. George always tries to keep Lennie  away from problems but can not guard lennie from the things that Lennie likes.<br />&quot;Of Mice and Men&quot; is a really good book so I`m going to give it 3 stars because from there you can learn and be excited at the same time .I think that you are never going to expect what is going to happen there, so try to read the book and then you will see that my recomendation is good
B00005JKYI|3.0|Teenager Ren MacCormack (Kevin Bacon) moves with his mom from big city Chicago to a small town in the Midwest after his parent's divorce. Ren is suprised to find that it's against the law to listen to rock 'n' roll and the law also prohibits dancing! Ren can't understand why these laws were brought about but tries his hardest to fit in with the town people. Unfortunately, though he's accepted as a friend by fellow student Willard (Chris Penn), no one else seems to like him, calling him a 'big-city kid' and a trouble-maker. After a while, he comes up with a plan to try to make it possible for the Senior students to be able to have a prom dance. He'll be going against the whole town, most specifically the Reverend Shaw Moore (John Lithgow) and the town council. Will Ren be able to change the stiff necked town people's minds? At the same time, Ren begins to fall in love with the Reverend's wild and unpredictable daughter Ariel (Lori Singer) while trying to keep his distance from her boyfriend Chuck (Jim Youngs). Also starring is Sarah Jessica Parker as Ariel's best friend Rusty, Dianne Wiest as the Reverend's wife Vi, and John Laughlin and Timothy Scott play Woody and Andy Beami, two of Ren's allies.<br />*PLOT* - This is my first and only 80's dance movie to watch and I must say that I very much enjoyed it. The plot was interesting though of course some points were a bit unrealistic. Basically the movie is in a way a 'coming-of-age' film. I loved the way each of the characters are portrayed. Kevin Bacon's character Ren represents the 'hero' of the movie. At first when I read the reviews I thought Ren would be your typical rebellious teenager. A bit on the contraire, he is responsible and you can't help but feel proud of him when he brings his case up to the council. It's hard to explain and I can't tell you much since this is only a review, but I must say that Ren's character was extremely well-done. Ariel on the other hand is very rebellious, and flaunts it to her father. I loved how she and her father were able to resolve their problems at the end.<br />*ACTING* - Kevin Bacon definitely steals the whole movie with his acting. He plays the part of a teenager perfectly, even the way he walks. His dancing was also spectacular, most notably his solo dance at the warehouse to the music, \\"Never\\" by Moving Pictures. If he was doing only half of what we see on screen, I'd still be impressed. John Lithgow is also outstanding, it was interesting to see his dramatic abilities after watching him on goofball comedy tv series, \\"3rd Rock from the Sun\\". He certainly can put power in his 'sermons'! Lori Singer beautifully stunning as Ariel, a perfect example of the category of 'wild and beautiful'. Besides the character of her father, Singer's character of Ariel has the most development in the movie. <br />*DANCING* - The dancing is just pure fun to watch, especially for people who loves 80's dancing. The last dance was not only the best dance, but the best part of the whole movie. If by chance somebody didn't enjoy the movie, I'm sure the end will make up for it. I loved it so much, I downloaded that segment onto my computer so I can watch it any time.<br />*SOUNDTRACK* - The soundtrack is another plus side to the movie. Besides the \\"Top Gun\\" soundtrack, \\"Footloose\\" is on my top list of favorite movie soundtracks. Great songs include two by Kenny Loggins, \\"Footloose\\" and \\"I'm Free (Heaven Helps the Man\\". Other of my favorites include \\"Let's Hear It For the Boy\\" (Denise Williams), \\"Almost Paradise\\" (Ann Wilson/Mike Reno), \\"Somebody's Eyes\\" (Karla Bonoff), and \\"Hurts So Good\\" (John Cougar Mellencamp). Plus there's plenty more!<br />*PG Rating* - From here I will be giving you the downside to the movie \\"Footloose\\". I was extremely disappointed that the movie does not hold true to what a real PG movie should be. There are many reasons as to why this movie should be changed to a PG-13 rating. Though the movie is about a small town which has a dislike for rock music and dancing, the movie portrays some of the teenagers there as being very immoral. Besides having sexual innuendo, some violence, and drugs scattered all over the movie, the language is also pretty strong. I strongly recommend parents not to have younger children watching this movie. Best for kids 15 and older.<br />Overall, \\"Footloose\\" has the great elements to make a good movie; great story, terrific acting, nice music, and cool dancing. But it also shows some of the immoralities of teenagers so parents should be cautioned. The movie is more aimed towards teenage viewers and adults might not find this movie terribly entertaining. But then again, adults might enjoy the movie for they might be able to relate to John Lithgow's character as the father who does not want to let go of his daughter because of his love for her.
6303921248|5.0|And that's not easy considering it's over 6 hours long!  You'll make the time if you own this set. I'm thinking about giving it for Christmas presents next year so that everyone I know has it!  Of course, Collin Firth is UNFORGETTABLE and TIMELESS in this movie.  That's the best acting I've EVER seen!  It's a collectable keeper!
B00005JLSC|4.0|I've never seen the stage version of Chicago, so I can't say if the movie was faithful to the source material, but judged on it's own by a pair of fresh eyes, Chicago was a lot of fun, especially considering I'm generally not crazy about movie musicals.<br />  Maybe this one was a little more palatable to me because most of the musical numbers were staged as the daydreams/fantasies of Renee Zellweger's character Roxie Hart, a wanna-be Jazz baby singer/murderess awaiting trial for killing her lover. Catherine Zeta-Jones co-stars as Velma Kelly, a singer/dancer in the same prison for her murder of her stage partner/sister and Husband, who she found in the sack together. Richard Gere plays Billy Flynn, the money-hungry Lawyer representing them both. (He's portrayed as a Jazz-era Johnny Cochran.) All three leads acquit themselves nicely in the song & dance department, especially Zeta-Jones, but to me the real revelations were Queen Latifah (As the Prison Matron) & John C. Reilly (Amos, the cuckold Husband of the ruthless Roxie); Reilly's rendition of \\"Mr. Cellophane\\" is heartbreaking. (It seems like lately Reilly is in every other movie that comes out, and with the quality of his performances, it's easy to see why.) I also got a kick out of seeing Christine Baranski, Chita Rivera, and Mya in smaller roles. The songs are really catchy, and I think I'm gonna have to check out Chicago on stage next. Although the movie dragged in spots, I still highly recommend it, even if you don't generally flock to musicals.

B000001EYW|3.0|For The Bee Gees, the tide seemed to turn all over again in the 1990's. They've acclaimed a huge success overseas, but not in the U.S. for a very long time. The last time The Gibb Brothers made it in the mainstream was in 1989 with the album, One. That album scored the Gibb Brothers their last Top 10 hit in America with One, which the record was made in memory with their brother, Andy Gibb who died that year of a terrible heart virus.<br />The 1997 album, Still Waters still proved that The Bee Gees still have made terrific music, although they didn't seem to have it all in the mainstream, with Corporate Pop acts like The Spice Girls, and The Backstreet Boys hype, many people didn't look at them as a inspiration. Although there were a few good songs on the record like Still Waters, and the Adult Contemporary hit, Alone. Although The Gibb Brothers recieved greater success with writing for Celine Dion that Year with Immortality for her Let's Talk About Love, it wasn't delivered on the this album, which I thought could've brought even better sales with Still Waters.<br />Tragically, it would be one of the last albums The Bee Gees would ever record as a trio. Band Member Maurice Gibb tragically died Saturday, January 11, 2003 in Miami of intestinal blockage. He was 53 years old. Although he has passed on, The Bee Gees still have made music that has lasted the longest test of time possible, still Stayin' Alive.

B00006RU5B|5.0|Ok first I would like to say not to listen to most of the reviewers that were &quot;dissapointed&quot; because it didn't sound like RATM. There is no reason to be dissapointed that it doesn't sound like Rage because it is NOT RATM! It is Audioslave. Rage and Audioslave are 2 differant bands! Yeah, Tom Morrelo and the rest some of the other former Rage members are in their, but that doesn't meant that the band has to sound like Rage. <br />With that said, I must say this is a great album. Cornel's writing is amazing as is his voice. And the Tom has definatly NOT lost his touch. Awesome riffs and lyrics that will stick in your head. Buy this album and put it on repeat on your stereo till it's worn out. Then buy another and repeat the process

B00005YW4H|4.0|I do think that a lot of Norah's success may be in part to her age (yes, and her looks... but isn't that always the case?) in that there's a lot of novelty factor in someone so young singing jazz.  But that doesn't mean that she's not worthy of the acclaim.  She has a mesmerizing voice, and a sexy vulnerability that comes across both on record and on stage.  True, some of the songs on this record are a little shallow lyrically (e.g. \\"I feel as empty as a drum\\"), but I like the melodies, the performance and most of all the honesty of the artist to who she is.
B00006DEFA|5.0|F. Murray Abraham's performance as Antonio Salieri in Amadeus is without a doubt the finest acting performance I have ever seen. In my opinion, it is THE standard by which all performances in the craft of acting should be measured (for all time).<br />I have seen many good performances for not-so-complex characters and many above-average performances for complex characters. But this is the only first-rate performance I have ever seen for such a complex character! In particular, the ease and brilliance with which Abraham was able to convey the cocktail of emotions in Old Salieri - and so lucidly make the audience see Mozart's genius through his own lens - was breathtaking. Every emotion known to Man was represented in the cocktail of Salieri's soul and Abraham's acting reproduced each one to perfection. And the audience could feel and touch Mozart's genius just by watching Abraham bleed his soul during his confession to the priest. This is when acting virtually becomes reality itself - it is almost impossible to believe that the real Salieri could have done a better job (acting as himself) than F. Murray Abraham.<br />Abraham's masterful performance was itself &quot;an absolute beauty&quot; (the very words Salieri used to describe one of Mozart's compositions).<br />In summary, Amadeus is a brilliant movie made immortal by an acting performance that has no pair.
B00006LSM3|4.0|I've read a review in the newspaper the other day that said this album was the highlight of George's solo career.  While I would love to give it my sympathy vote for all the joy George's music brought me through the years, I honestly don't think this is his best. That title goes to &quot;Cloud Nine&quot; in my book. Nevertheless, about half the songs on this album are really good, a couple are great and a couple more are dreadfully boring.
B00005NTN5|4.0|Okay Bound was a pretty good movie but the plot has been done before. The movie itself would have played out the same if \\" Corky \\" was a guy. What makes the movie good is the plot after Gina Gershon and Jennifer Tilly start their relationship. Everything before is so stereotypical it hurts. The lesbian part of this movie plays as a marketing tool. It's still a good movie to watch, but  just remember not all lesbians rob from gangsters, and wear black
B000068PQ0|5.0|the flaming lips completely blew me away with this album, it was so cool and strong and just plain showed sonic genius. all people who consider themselves to appreciate music should purchase this.
B00005JL3A|5.0|I can't wait Untill Resident Evil Nemesis comes out in 2003/2004! Great Director! I love they way it is based on the RE Series from the Classic PS days! RE 1,2! it is just a even total different type of Horror Movie! Um \\"Night Of The Livin Dead!\\" Remember that classic movie will its kinda like it so..watch and see if you like it..Don't watch it in the dark!
B00000099Y|5.0|Stinkfist= kicked ...!<BR>Eulogy= great<BR>H= cool<BR>46&2= solid<BR>Hooker w/ A Penis= for the haters<BR>Intermission= awesome<BR>Jimmy= awesome<BR>Push It= great<BR>NEMA= kicked ...<BR>3RD Eye= the best
B000002LRX|5.0|After the massive success of \\"The Real Thing\\", Faith No More looked composed to hurl their way into the big time. Yet, rather than repeating the formula of \\"The Real Thing\\", the band chose to release a follow-up that could possibly be the most challenging arranged musical compositions the music industry has ever witnessed. An individual should listen to \\"Angel Dust\\" on a numerous occasions to grasp the brilliance of Faith No More's unique sound (Given that the person has enough patience). The stand out tracks including, A Small Victory, Midlife Crises, Everything's Ruined and Be Aggressive are all incredible, the best bunch of songs they have ever written, performed and composed. Eleven years after its release \\"Angel Dust\\" continues to give and give without disappointment. Truly, the best faith no more album released at the peak of their career, this is your chance to witnessed the most innovative and creative rock groups of our time. Angel Dust is a must buy
0812550706|5.0|&quot;Ender's Game&quot; was an exciting novel that kept me wanting to read more after every page that I turned.  I thoroughly enjoyed reading &quot;Ender's Game&quot;, because it was well written.  At some parts you could feel exactly how Ender felt, because of the author's wonderful description.  You also felt like you were in the story watching this young hero grow up and become a man.  As Ender makes his way through Battle School with all of theother geniuses of the world,he over comes many obstacles, and becomes a hero, Ender makes many trustworthy friends who help him along the way.  I would recommend this book,and the sequel &quot;Ender's Shadow&quot; to anyone who is interested in things like space, science fiction, and stories with magnificent heroes!
B000000JO3|4.0|back when it was safe to call hardcore \\"hardcore,\\" it was excellent. take DC's legendary Minor Threat. their songs were played very loud, very brief, very fast, and directly to the point. Ian Mackaye's vocals are expressive and erratic (imagine Sam Kinison as a disturbed young man who joined a band like Black Flag) and his lyrics about everything from religion (\\"Filler\\"), drug use (\\"Straight Edge,\\" where the sXe movement originated, \\"Bottled Violence\\") and self-esteem (\\"Small Man Big Mouth\\") were very meaningful, despite the fact that they were indecipherable at times. the sound quality on this album is poor, probably due to the fact that they didn't have much money and had to use bad recording equipment, but to an extent, you feel the intensity of Minor Threat, and their brief but influential reign as DC hardcore saviors.
B00000HYXB|5.0|As a long time Blind Guardian fan I picked up this CD and I was instantly transported into Tolkien's DARK SIDE.<br />This album is a masterpiece. It belongs in an art gallery because it is a master piece.<br />The story will knock you off your feet. I was in tears and then I was laughing. I don't know man, this is DEEP STUFF. I mean REAL deep.<br />I think there is a greater truth in this album, a truth we will never know for sure. <br />GANDALF FOREVER
B0000714BP|5.0|I have say that I only bought &quot;To Wong Foo, Thanks for Everthing Julie Newmar&quot; because my mom really wanted it. And she really enjoyed it. The DVD looks and sounds really good, but the special features are pretty bare. The only thing that you get are deleted scenes. Overall, it was a great buy for the price
B00005QG9J|5.0|one of my favourite, most played album. i'm surprise at the gap of difference between this album and their last. but that's all good. it gives you a sense of... tranquility and zen. brandon's 'near enlightened' lyrics goes well with their new sound. i especially love the last track, aqueous transmission. and no it does not make one want to pee.
B000063DIR|1.0|As you have already noticed the amount of negative reviews on this release, you probably already know that former bassist (Bob Daisley) and drummer (Lee Kerslake) have been removed, not only from the record, but also from the photo inside. The album was re-recorded with current line-up bassist and drummer.<br />But what really makes me sick is that I don't have the original version of 'Blizzard of Ozz'. It's out of print. That's why I can't understand the guys who say &quot;I grew up with the original, I find this re-record stupid...&quot; but hey, you own the original, so what's the matter ??<br />To add something the other reviewers didn't say yet (well, I guess) is that Bob Daisley and Lee Kerslake began a trial against the Osbournes, but for the moment, they are losing,<BR>because they couldn't prove they weren't paid the royalties they deserved for the first 2 Ozzy solo albums.<BR>But anyway, there's no reason why they shouldn't win. <BR>The answer may be given in the first months of 2003.<br />To finish, let's put some quotes of Ozzy's wife that say it all :<br />&quot;Bob Daisley and Lee Kerslake have harassed Ozzy and our family for several years. <br />&quot;Because of their abusive and unjust behaviour, Ozzy wanted to remove them from these recordings.<br />&quot;We turned a negative into a positive by adding a fresh sound to the original albums.&quot; <br />HORRIBLE ! I can't even imagine how she could dare to say that !
B000069CWE|4.0|a little late at reviewing this album, but if you liked Hybrid Theory, this is a mustbuy. it gives an entire perspective on their songs. fans will definitely lap this one up.<BR>although one can't help but think that this is just a ploy to keep fans interested while they work on their second album. despite that, Linkin Park definitely have talent
0316666343|2.0|The first of the book held me.  As it continued, I became frustrated trying to figure out who she was talking about at that moment.  The ending was terrible and very unsatisfying.
B00005MP58|3.0|The plot and acting on this DVD are strictly five-star.  But the qualty of the video is distressingly worse than what was broadcast on PBS; quite poor by modern standards.  You may be able to set that flaw aside as you become engrossed in the story, but it's inexcusable that you should have to.
B00005JLRR|1.0|Oh Whatever!  I saw this movie last night and it was sooo bad.  The special effects.  The ridiculously executed plot, which had potentintial for good but was just bad, bad, bad.... I wanted very badly to sleep through it, but it was too hard in the movie theater seats.
B000069HK2|1.0|Why do people keep calling the Used punk?  I checked them out, and I have to say, the singer's voice is whiny and annoying, the songs drag and generally suck, and the album is just plain bad.  These guys are the farthest from punk it's possible to be.
0380820846|5.0|I thoroughly, completely, and utterly enjoyed this novel.  I found myself wanting to laugh out loud many times, although I refrained as I was reading it in a public place.  :)  Still, I couldn't help but devour it and ended up reading it in two sittings.  You should read it, if for nothing else, because Lady Whistledown is unmasked!  This was my first Julia Quinn book and I've already started on The Duke and I.  Highly entertaining, quick read.
0316666343|5.0|The Lovely Bones is on of the best books I have ever read.  Even with all the difficulties of looking upon a grieving family, friends, a detective who has been faced with many unsolved crimes and the grusome murder.  I was fortunite enough to come a long this book, as part of an assignment for a psychology class.  With a story line I will never forget, and an author who has had a beautiful debut, this book is likely to become my all time favorite, and read over and over again.
B000075BFK|5.0|Man I tell ya, You can never go wrong with a good Tupac Album. Better Dayz explains this perfectly.This has to be his best posthumous cd since \\"Greatest Hits\\". Although he has some tracks that have been floating around on the internet for some time, the music still sounds fresh due to the good producing. I really like the \\" When We Ride on Our Enemies\\" and \\" My Block\\" remixes, sounds like they have been produced well. My personal favs are \\"Better Dayz\\", \\"They Don't Give A F**K About Us\\", and \\"Never Call U B***H Again\\". But I think the best song on the cd is \\"Mama's Just A Little Girl\\". He has a nice flow and it's always cool to tell a story and have a tight beat. My only beef with this album is that he has Nas on \\"Thugz Mansion\\". This is a definite \\"No-No\\" because everybody knows that Pac had beef with Nas. Pac crushed him on his \\"7 Day Theory\\" cd. I don't think it is cool for artist to \\"imagine\\" that they are cool with dead MCs. Oh yeah Pac also said Trick Daddy's name on \\"Still Ballin\\"....makes you wonder doesen't it??? This cd is a must have if you want to listen to real rap music.
B000002NIW|5.0|Every single song on this CD is perfect. Chino's voice is hypnotizing and the way he screams is perfect. This CD is one of the best CD's i own. DEFINETLY one of Deftones finest. Don't even hesitate to buy this CD. my personal favorite song on this CD would be either 'Be Quiet and Drive (Far Away)' or 'Mx', but every song is so heavy it's very difficult to choose favorites! Be careful listening to this one, it'll make you want to break something! Buy it, now!
B00004BZ0N|5.0|I got this record for Christmas after waiting for a month, a couple of days after Joe's death. It is tied with their self-titled for my favourite album I own. Every single song on here is unbelievable, it blows a persons mind!! Not only are their great catchy riffs on here but great often political lyrics that actually have meaning. Many grat kinds of music are blended on here, and it works perfectly. What can I say I love it!
B00003CXXM|5.0|As soon as I saw this movie in the theatres, I went out and bought the book immediately. I recommend both items. This movie will look great on any movie buff's list.
B00005OM5L|5.0|The best video buy I've ever made!Buy it,watch it,and revell in the best Clapton in thirty years!
6304383827|5.0|I have watched this movie literally a hundred times or more. It's one of my favorite movies and I don't always like movies that fall into the &quot;romance&quot; genre. This movie is filmed in lush scenery and utilizes that Austen wit. It's a purely fun movie to watch. <BR>Emma is a spoiled but warmhearted English lady(Gwyneth Paltrow--as in aristocrat) who thinks nothing of interfering with her friends own personal issues and love lives. She makes a mess of trying to guide her newest friend's(Harriet, played by Toni Collette from &quot;The Sixth Sense&quot;/&quot;Muriels Wedding&quot;)introduction to society and an equal mess of advising her on whom to choose as a suitor. It's only when she realizes her friend has fallen for her dashing best male friend, Mr. Knightley(Jeremy Northrup), that she comes to terms with her own feelings. Although she temporarily devestates her best friend, Harriet, with the news of her engagement to Mr. Knightley, everything comes to rights in the end and Harriet uses her own advice and follows her heart. <BR>Maybe this is what guys would call a &quot;chick flick&quot;, but secretly my boyfriend will watch it with me...although not more than a couple of times...this is definitely the movie my best friend (hello sara!) and I love to watch with all of its elegant costuming, beautiful scenery, and the daydream that it would be nice to live in Emma's world. <BR>(There are also many other characters who add charm and wit to Emma's world...especially Mrs. Elton. Her snobbery and out-and-out rudeness is pretty funny.)
0684874350|5.0|This book is brilliant not because it is a Pulitzer Prize winner (although it actually is), but because it is written in such a heartfelt manner. <br />A painfully honest memoir, I was totally glued to the pages. The description of life in Catholic Ireland was vivid and gave a whole new meaning to hardship and resilience.<br />McCourt is an excellent writer and he took us all through his early days in Ireland until his journey to the United States of America. If only all memoirs are this interesting!
0060523794|4.0|This is an excellent book giving a birds eye view on how a large, successful company can deteriorate to a level that is destroying the company and yet insiders are virtually oblivious to the actual impact their actions are playing in that demise. How an outsider is sometimes needed to help them see the way out. I think Mr. Gerstners skills as a consultant and especially his experience as a significant IBM customer were significant to the turnaround at IBM and gives clear examples how a person does not have to be an expert at a specific business to lead it to higher ground. <br />I really appreciated the strategic planning and reasoning provided by the writer as to the direction IBM took on mergers and acquisitions and the reason most of the proposals were best left alone. Growth for the sake of growth is not advisable if it is not strategic to the core of the company's goals.<br />This is a good, easy read and relatively captivating book. It does get a little lengthy, and the many letters at the end of the book are only interesting to get a better view inside Mr. Gerstner. Actually, I found them enlightening, but not always portraying the message he actually intended, at least not as strong as he thought he made it.
0316666343|1.0|This book was recommended to me by many people so I finally relented and read it over the weekend.  On the positive side, it is short, there are no typos, and I didn't pay my own money for it.  The negatives are more numerous and substantial.  The story is founded on a secular spirituality, which allows the reader to experience mysticism while avoiding any references to God or religion, so it belongs in the same class of pastimes as numerology, astrology, crystals, Feng-shui, etc., that currently occupy weak-minded and lazy post-hippie suburbanites.  These things allow you to have deep spiritual insights without reading long words or thinking too hard, or depriving yourself in any way, so that's nice, isn't it.  The character Ruth also embodies the feminist crusade against male-female violence, except that rather than inventing statistics and redefining violence to shape the issue, she literally finds dead women and girls in every step around midtown Manhattan.  This is, I'm sure, very satisfying for some comfortable women who would like to pretend to feel endangered and oppressed from the comfort of their suburban kitchens, and would like to pretend that they are &quot;on the ramparts&quot; against a real issue rather than just driving their SUVs to the tennis club, but it is tripe.  The novel is badly written, it is directed at a fifth-grade reading level, the character development is slap-dash, the story is incredible, and the ending is contrived and ridiculous.  I suggest as an alternative that you go outside for ten minutes and gaze at the sky.
B000002AGE|4.0|There's energy and drive to spare in this landmark work from the premier jazz fusion act of the 70s, the impeccable Weather Report. A remarkable blend of style, hip grooves, and smoking hooks, &quot;Heavy Weather&quot; dragged jazz kicking and screaming from the doldrums of the early 70s (look into the jazz works of that period and you'll see what I mean, though there are a few gems) into an era where jazz would ultimately meet (and fuse) with pop/rock elements, evident on tracks such as &quot;Birdland&quot; and &quot;Harlequin.&quot; There's even a little disco present in the sharp hooks of &quot;Teen Town.&quot; That doesn't mean that Weather Report sacrificed their roots for the sake of a modern sound; rather, they integrated the improvisational nature of jazz into the standard rhythms and sounds of the day. There are moments when the music shows its age, though it's not from the arrangements or the traditional instruments, but from the synthetic sound of the period's keyboards, which have a harsh edge typical of the time. That in no way detracts from the overall quality of this remarkable work.  The core of the group--keyboardist Joe Zawinul and sax artist Wayne Shorter--provide the basis for &quot;Heavy Weather's&quot; multi-layered sound, but it's the late Jaco Pastorius who nearly steals the show with magnificent efforts on bass and drums. This is one of the great jazz works of any era, and is highly recommended.
B00006RU5B|5.0|In today's world of sampling old licks and trying to turn heavy rock into [stuff], it's good to hear some straight ahead rock and roll.  No it's not RATM, it's not Soundgarden, but it is Cornell and his awesome vocals added to the RATM beats. This reminds me alot of Temple of the Dog... which never really was popular, but has some great songs.  But hey, don't listen to me... buy it and make a decision for yourself. It's worth it!
B00004TX5F|5.0|This is possibly my favorite movie, and I was shocked to see bad customer reviews of it on Amazon.com. To set matters right: The film is amazing, both as a look at 18th-century attitudes towards music, and as a story about the many different incarnations love takes. The film's sex scenes are probably some of the most beautiful around, and those that feel they are unnecessary to the film are probably looking at the past through puritanical filters. (The twentieth century did not, in fact, invent good sex...) <br />Castrati were, in fact, very much sex symbols in their time and farinelli, when in the service of the spanish king, was summoned ot him \\"most nights to sing until one or two o'clock in the morning,\\" interptet it as you will. For more information on Castrati, see \\"Eunuchs and Castrati, a Cultural History\\" and also The chapter on castrati in \\"Singers of Italian Opera\\".<br />As far as authenticity is concerned, the film portrays baroque audiences, with theior liveliness and level of involvement, beautifully, and I find the director's portrayal of Farinelli quite satisfactory. The machinery and decadence of the opera of the time is conveyed to perfection, and much research has obviously gone into the film.<br />Handel's music, of course, speaks for itself. It can be easy to get lost in a Handel opera sometimes, among Da Capo arias, but this movie reminds us that this is, in fact, some of the most beautiful music ever written.
B000066C87|5.0|Reading the customer reviews, it's obvious people either love or hate this movie...and sometimes for personal reasons. One commented on the phoney British accents - odd, considering many of the actors hail from England. Another found the characters evil - I found them refreshing honest in their dishonesty.<br />I loved this movie which surprised me 'cause I am not a great fan of director Altman's MASH or Nashille.<br />You have to really pay attention to what's on the screen because each scene is like a painting...there's almost always more than one thing to focus on; often more than one character talking at the same time. I loved that. I could't believe the bitchiness, the selfishness -- and not like Hollywood's usual over-the-top portrayals. These are people you meet at large dinner parties (minus the accents).<br />Maggie Smith and Helen Mirren were nominated for best-supporting Oscars and I had thought, as much as I love these performers, I wonder if they're just nominations for their body of work. Wrong...they simply are amazing.<br />I won't promise you will enjoy this movie as much as I, but I highly recommend you give it a try.
0767805712|5.0|This is the movie that everyone overlooked.  I have heard people call it a thriller that is too slow, a mystery that is too unimportant, and a feel-good movie that doesn't make you feel good.  It is not any of these; it is a transport to a world where your whole life is determined from the time of your birth, and it is the story of a man with too much ambition to accept his fate.  I would rank it highly among the best movies of all time.<br />Gattaca is set in a near-future where doctors screen embryos for genetic 'defects' during in-vitro fertilization.  Nobody has children the natural way anymore, because why would you risk having a child with high potential for heart disease?  Designer babies can be promised a life of perfect health, perfect vision, and unlimited potential.  And such children would obviously grow into better workers, athletes, and lifemates.  Genetic discrimination might be illegal, but everybody does it.  A handshake, a fallen hair, any mark that your body leaves behind can be used to measure just how perfect or imperfect you are.<br />Enter one Vincent Freeman (Ethan Hawke).  He is a love child, a \\"faith birth\\", an In-Valid with bad genes, nearsightedness, and a potential (but unconfirmed) heart defect.  He dreams of the stars, and of exploring them himself one day.  But Gattaca - the future's equivelent to NASA - only employs the best of the best, the cream of the crop... the genetically perfect.  Denied his dream, Vincent joins the underground ranks of the \\"de-gene-rates\\", \\"borrowed ladders\\", people who refuse to play the genetic hand that they were dealt.  He purchases the identity of the recently-crippled Jerome 'Eugene' Morrow (Jude Law), and he meticulously replaces his every fallen hair and drop of blood with samples from Eugene.<br />And it works.  Armed with Eugene's biology, Vincent-as-Jerome has the drive, discipline, and ability to live his dream.  As the movie opens, he is one of Gattaca's most promising candidates, getting ready for his first mission into space.  But one inattentive moment, caught by an ill-timed murder investigation, threatens to unravel everything Vincent has worked for.<br />Gattaca is several things rolled into a larger picture.  There is a thriller aspect: will Vincent evade detection or will he be unmasked and have his dreams shattered?  There is a love story: does the woman he is involed with care about him, or his genes?  There is a background mystery: who is responsible for the murder of the mission director?  But none of these are the central theme, which is this: how far can the human spirit go in pursuit of a dream?<br />The movie asks and tries to answer that question in flawless manner.  The clean-cut, sanitized designs of the future evoke a vaguely impersonal setting.  The pacing of the movie is slow, but steady - every moment is played perfectly.  Ethan Hawke delivers a fantastic performance as Vincent, but it is Jude Law who really shines as his opposite - a man with everything but ambition, someone who felt entitled to the world and is now too angry and embittered to help himself.<br />Andrew Niccol's screenplay is simply brilliant, and full of detail, right down to the words and phrases - degenerates, borrowed ladders, 'Eugene' and eugenics, Gattaca and the G/C/A/T codes that make up DNA.  There is far too much depth in this movie to convey in any review.  I have watched it a half-dozen times, and there is always a nuance or subtle take that I missed before, and which changes the way I think of it.<br />Ultimately, Gattaca is a movie with a strong belief in the human spirit.  It is not just clever, it is smart - its joy isn't in its twists and turns, but in its message.  It is a parable about the importance of dreams in a world captivated by genetic science.  And I think that anyone who lives in todays world, with the near-future looming so close overhead, should be able to appreciate it.
B00005OM4N|1.0|my friend got this cd, and i must say it really ... she really looks and sings like a .... (no offence to britney) sure the first cd was kinda cute, but after that they just all went way downhill. now if u want some GOOD music, worth listening to, i suggest Eminem (the eminem show)or Good Charlotte.
B00006JJ1O|5.0|Finally t.A.T.u.'s 200KM/H in the Wrong Lane has been released in the U.S.  These two girls are cute, look wonderful together as a couple and have complimentary voices.  Their songs are often about young gay/lesbian love but anyone can relate to them.  The first single, \\"All the things she said\\" is an incredible dance song and is just as good in Russian.  The techno-dance music on this CD is ground-breaking.  Their voices take a listen or two to get used to but then you'll be hooked.  Their remake of the Smith's \\"How soon is now\\" is utterly compelling.  Other CD highlights are the title track \\"Not gonna get us,\\" \\"Clowns\\" and the bubbly \\"Malchik Gay\\".  Trevor Horn does a great job in (over)production and let's hope this is just the beginning of more energetic dance music from t.A.T.u.
B000066NW0|5.0|i got the cd a while back and first let me just say avril rocks! she can totally stay herself in this britney wannabe world. her songs are really cool, b4 i got the cd all i heard was \\"complicated\\" and i loved it, so i bought the cd, went home and listended to it all the way through, and from \\"losing grip\\" to \\"tomorrow\\" to \\"naked\\" were all really great, it like didnt dissappoint me at all! i would totally recomend it to anybody who likes her punky rock music!
B00006SFLV|5.0|It's hard to believe it's been over 8 years since this wonderful show's only season aired and was cancelled. It was too good for a public who preferred to watch shows like Blossom that do not make them think or feel. Still easily the best, most realistic show about teenagers that I have ever seen (I am 38 years old). If you are in to well-acted, well written show that can (at different times) make you laugh, cry, happy and angry, get these DVD's. You will be in for a treat.
B00005JKZT|5.0|After awe....... How do they make an amazing sequal to an amazing prequel! I have no regrets to \\"The two towers\\" except for the fact that if you haven't read the book it's going to seem kind of and odd storyline. While Frodo and Sam meet up with the creature gollum and merry and Pippin meet up with the ents and in the futur demolish Isenguard and the Orthanc, Aragorn Legolas and Gimli (the somewhat main characters of the movie) set off to fight for Rohan in the climactic battle of Helm's deep. Aragorn was the very social one of the trio and I belived for a second that he was cheating on Arwen for Eoywen. Legolas I belived was the greatest character int he lord of the ring series. His stunning elf scences create him into a robinhood ype guy who does the coolest stunts like how he gets one-handedly flips upon a howse and when he takes a shield and boards down a flight of stairs on it and takes out orcs with his bow at the same time. Gimli was the funniest one of the trio for his comical way of being short and at the beginning when he lags behind r=the other in an orc-hunt. Movie=amazing  acting=supperb.
B00001NFCY|5.0|I bought this CD, a few years ago, what can I say I am a procastinator. When Creed first released My Own Prison in 1997, I was not a fan.  In fact, I would switch the radio station if a song from that CD would play.  However, when the single &quot;With Arms Wide Open&quot; started palying on the airwaves, I listened.  Yes, it is overplayed, but it started me listening to Creed's music.<br />I must admitt that it was not until I heard &quot;Higher&quot; on the radio before I decided that I wanted the CD.  Now I did not purchase the CD, I was smart about that, I asked for it as a gift.<br />There are many CDs in my collection that I bought or wanted (gifts) that I only listen to one or two songs.  This is not one of those.  I listen to the entire CD, and there is not one song on it that I don't like.  Now the before mentioned songs got me hooked to Creed's music, they are not my favorites on the CD.  Don't get me wrong I like them a lot.<br />To share an anecdote:  While my husband and I were dating, I had bought him the CD as a gift.  He doesn't usually listen to rock music and teases me about my tastes in music.  But he loves this CD.  In fact this CD has traveled overseas with us on a trip to North Africa.  While driving through the counrtyside we played this CD non-stop... well almost.<br />True Creed's music is over played, but there are other good songs on this CD that have had less air time.  Maybe there is a reason as to why they have sold millions of copies of their music?  It is nice to listen to artists that write their own music and actually have meaning.  Remember when this CD was released grunge was dead, and pre-packaged teen pop music was the rage.  This CD was something different at the time.
B00005JKCH|5.0|It's just a fun movie.  Special effects were great, and some of the liscense they took was actually an improvement.  Maguire played an good Parker, with that geeky kind of outlook on everything.  For a first movie that has to introduce everything and everybody, they did a wonderful job (much better than I expected).  Defoe overplayed his role a bit, but that is kind of his calling card anyways.  The web slinging was excellently done (computers are wonderful things).<br />Yeah, if you are looking for a movie that is 100% comic book faithful, you might be a bit irritated at some of the changes.  But if you are looking for that, you need to stay away from Hollywood all together.<br />If you are looking for a fun night with the family, or just want a good fun action flick, this is a definite good choice.  I even got to see it on a plane ride back from France.  Watching Spiderman swing around the city, while the plane is undergoing turbulance is a VERY interesting feeling.  :)
B0000797IO|2.0|Come on people! Sure there are a few good moments, and I am not one to necessarily criticize offbeat comedies; however, this is just a lousy movie overall. If you want to see a film that is consistently funny with a decently written script and that has Jennifer Aniston in it, see &quot;Office Space.&quot; Jennifer's acting is impressive enough in \\"Good Girl,\\" but the slow pace and sloppiness just makes me wish I had spent the last hour and a half, using my mind in a more productive way than this seeing this trite movie about basically uninteresting people making poor decisions with their lives. &quot;One Hour Photo&quot; uses characters working in a mega shopping center but unlike &quot;Good Girl&quot; has a better script.  I felt like I was teased along for an unsatisfying ending in this sappy little movie.
B00005JKZT|3.0|So long!!!! yes.  I enjoyed the first one better because it had more adventure to it a little less talk. If you must a very big fan to enjoy the entire 3 hours and 10 min of it, I admit after the first hour I was bored out of my mind.  But in a \\"planned\\" Triligy the 2nd movie always seems to be the settig for the 3rd which useally like in this movie has a lot of taking and setting up.  If you gunna go see it I suggest takeing a neck pillow  with you and be pre-bared to sit there for a long while, if you have read the book or really enjoy it may seem like 45 min to you if you havent it will seem like 11 hours (no joke).    <BR> But now to complamit it, I was blown away by the battel seqences so well done I couldent beleve it thats what made it intresting to me and I look foward to Lord of The Rings III<BR>    But be pre-pared I hered the 3rd and final installment is going to be about 3 hours and 45 min.
B00005YW4H|5.0|I first heard Don't Know Why as a snipit on aol, but that was enough to convince me that Norah Jones has a timeless voice that has not been heard since the days of other rarities like Lena Horn, Billie Holiday Patsy Cline, and of course Judy Garland.  Norah Jones is the next legendary diva.  She has a voice and enough talent to be one of the greatest singers of the 21st century and I wish her all the luck in the world.

B00000AFFI|5.0|This album is one of my dearest possessions. While I like all PJ Harvey's albums, this by far my favourite, and for all the virtues of earlier, rockier, dirtier Polly Jean, I think this is her most subtle, complex and richly textured album. While I love the brash gender-bending rock of \\"Rid of Me\\", and the theatrical melodrama of \\"To Bring You My Love\\", this album seems much more intimate to me, and almost incandescent in its loveliness. It's still obvious that PJ Harvey is trying on different masks on this album, playing with various personae; she's still very fond <BR>of the archetype of the abandoned female, for instance, and the parade of lovesick, self-devouring women on this album is seemingly endless. This time, though, PJ Harvey externalizes this role-playing a little by creating characters - Joy, Catherine, Leah. She's always loved delving into the myths of femininity, and trying them on like dresses - or not wearing them at all. Here, though, the lyrics don't just screw with Biblical references, but conjure up whole narratives, and here, the phrasing is subtle, allusive, and quietly poetic. I've had this album for years and I'm still trying to decipher the stories that linger aambiguously behind the words. \\"The Garden\\", for instance, has always sounded to me like a homosexual encounter between a young boy and an older man - with a vague hint of menace and the suggestion of defilement thrown into the mix. But, then, who knows? It's funny I should feel this album is so warm and incandescent, because, really, it's pure winter on all of these 12 tracks, and the moments of beauty and clarity are often perverse, pitted against all possible odds, and haunted by a sinister undercurrent - and the characters are, almost without exception, jaded, empty, and debased by their overwhelming hunger for love. And yet it persists, the slow-burning beauty of this album, especially on the title track, \\"Angelene\\", and \\"The River.\\" It's suffice to say that if the Brontes sisters were alive and collaborating on an album, it might sound a bit like this.
B00005JKJA|5.0|I am a 41 year old man, and this is the best movie I've ever <BR>watched. It is amazing because most of the movie is the movie<BR>a young lady invents inside her own mind to explain and subsume<BR>her real life.  In other words the images and speeches are all<BR>filtered through her troubled mind, and any details of her real<BR>life, aside from a few brief minutes in the film, must be <BR>inferred from the film-inside-her-head, which is most of the<BR>movie.<BR>   <BR>That said, let me proceed with the explanation, as I think it is<BR>not too hard to figure out.  The chief problem in figuring out <BR>the film, is deciding what is dream/fantasy sequence, and what <BR>is real.  Leaving aside the disturbing questions that Lynch <BR>raises about the illusory quality of life in general, I believe <BR>there is a definite part of the film that can be called real-life<BR>and another that can be called dream/fantasy.<br />The first short sequence of the dancers is fantasy.  The seconds-<BR>long scene which follows - the first-person camera going down to<BR>the red pillow - is real, probably Diane Selwyn as she drifts off<BR>to sleep or death.  The rest of the movie, up until the descent <BR>into the secret box, is fantasy.  The scenes and characters and<BR>lines are inventions of Diane Selwyn.  Whether they are based on <BR>real people, or are composites based on several people, or are <BR>completely unconscious formations is not revealed; we can only <BR>infer.<br />The next real life scene begins after the box thing, when she <BR>wakes up and lets in her ex-roommate to pick up her things.  She<BR>soon descends into madness/fantasy again, with the hallucinatory<BR>sexual fantasy of Camille.  In my opinion the hit man scene, and<BR>the dinner party are hallucinations (they are simply not logical<BR>enough to be real life), and the real Diane Selwyn doesn't <BR>return until the ominous knocks on the door propel her into the <BR>mad despair which causes her to take her own life at the end.<br />One of the more interesting things about the film is when in real<BR>time the fantasy takes place.  Is it a life-in-fantasy review<BR>as she lays dying, a haunting dream, or a premonition?  I think<BR>Lynch is telling us something very important about the illusory<BR>quality of our lives, and how life imitates art in very important<BR>respects.  <br />Thank you for reading this review.

B00003JRCQ|5.0|This movie is one of my Austen's favorite. I should say that, in fact, its completely different from other Austen adaptations but all the same it captures best the character's feelings in the book. Of course is not as so \\"dynamic\\" as other adaptations but we must understand that this novel is the last one that Jane Austen wrote and is entirely different from the others. Many critics say that this novel was written in a new style and much of the situation and places are highly connected with Austen's own life so involves much more mature emotions ,and if we consider that this is one of the oldest protagonists of  Austen's novel and has suffer a vast deal more than any other character, it is absolutely rational to expect a much more serious movie with deep \\"hidden\\" feelings in which the audience can understand and connect with Anne's feelings. <BR>I absolutely think that Amanda Root's performance is superior, it has credibility, and most of all she is capable of expressing  the love, and passion that she feels for Cap. Wentworth, and at the same time the pain and suffering that she bestowed all those years , to me she fully represents my idea of Anne Elliot. <BR>Ciaran Hinds its mostly the same, he is wonderful! Everything that a Cap. Wentworth should be. His performance really makes you suffer and love him through the movie with his looks, and at the same time with his indifferences towards Anne. Pitty that the movie does not shows Anne and Wentworth kissing for a longer time !!!!!<BR>To me this movie is one of the greatest adaptations of Austen's novel with P&P, faithfully to the book and intense as the book itself.

B00005JKJA|2.0|Few films polarize audiences like David Lynch`s Mulholland Drive.  The vast majority of average filmgoers will be unsatisfied with this movie, because it is unconventional to the point of confusion.  Some viewers don't see this as a problem, however, calling the movie  \\"eerie,\\" \\"provocative,\\" and \\"cerebral.\\"  <br />People who are fans of Lynch have a thirst for the challenge of traditional aesthetics and the disruption of the conventional rules for watching films.  As a study of art, Mulholland Drive is rich and fascinating.  As a motion picture, however, it just does not work.<br />Hollywood produces many films that are hard to understand at first (Momento, Fight Club, Pulp Fiction, etc).  Each subsequent viewing helps clear the muddiness.  Mulholland Drive, on the other hand, becomes more confusing.   The harder you try to understand it, the more frustrated you will become.<br />When the traditional filmgoer sees this movie, the viewing is as difficult as someone who enjoys landscape paintings first encountering the art of Andy Warhol.   The experience is totally foreign.    Unless you have a background in some form of art analysis and admire works labeled  \\"Post-Modern\\" or \\"Avant-Gaurde,\\" I would not suggest this film.  Those who do love \\"art for art's sake\\" will call this the best film of 2001.  Therefore, the question of whether you should see Mulholland Drive really is contingent on your own expectations.    I expect a movie to by marginally comprehendible, and so, I found the viewing to be less than enjoyable.
6304602979|5.0|this may be the greatest movie ever made!  it has all the elements of a classic film.  written, directed, and shot with the artistry of a great composer.  not to mention the cast. as fabulous as ever assembled.  if there were oscars give for specific scenes(i think there should be) there are three in this movie that would receive one. after viewing this movie treat yourself to another incredible experience and watch \\"romeo is bleeding\\". it's a beauty also.

This stuff melds together with as much continuity and spontaneity as anything Miles was doing at the time. The secret is Herbie Hancock, who effortlessly shines through this whole recording. Also, Hubbard sounds very natural in this context.
0440180295|5.0|Slaughterhouse Five by Kurt Vonnegut is a very well-written book.  Vonnegut does an excellent job of keeping your attention by adding certain aspects of humor to a very solemn subject.  The time-travel can get a bit confusing at times, but is easily understood after a little thought.  He adds in certain passages that have nothing to do with anything, with absolutely no meaning, then triggers the reader to try to interpret what he was talking about by asking why.  I would highly recommend this book to anyone who is interested in an entertaining anti-war book.
B00006CXSS|5.0|All the way from the start you feel as if you know how they feel even if you dont really know their characters till you have watched it twice.  During Bastogne you truly realise their suffering and become a bit more attached.<BR>        Sadly after watching the large documentary it makes you realise that it is actually a lot shallower than you would be made to think.  Perhaps if they spent the same budget on a miniseries 1/2 as long it could have been even better, i dont know.  What i do know is that it is most certainly worth buying and watching as it is much more enthralling than Saving Private Ryan and you can watch select parts whenever you want.<BR>        On the other hand perhaps we could have a series depicting another part of war than just the Americans winning the war (no disrespect) but maybe a film based on the brits with perhaps a slightly more even approach to the enemy and perhaps even a small insight into their lives.  Sadly i think anyone would find it difficult to contend with this.<BR>        Needless to say this is definately worth watching even if you just rent it though it can do with watching twice because its so good.

B000007MVD|5.0|The four Beatles introduce themselves and the instruments they play.  Leave it to Mr. Lennon to be the witty one:  \\"I'm John and I too play the guitar.  Sometimes I play the fool.\\"<br />Live at the BBC means that this was broadcast on any one of their radio program appearances from 1963 to 1965.  However, there are actual live versions of \\"Thank You Girl\\" and \\"I Saw Her Standing There\\" here.  And their version of \\"A Hard Day's Night\\" is interrupted during that final guitar just to prove that this wasn't just a record playing.<br />The rapport between the radio host and the Beatles is also fun, in the spirit of the dialogue on the A Hard Day's Night movie.  John in particular is quite a clown.  They get Lee Peters to introduce \\"Baby It's You\\" in his famous James Mason-impersonation voice.  Another time, we learn that the Beatles current single is at number one in Portugal and it's called \\"Crisnk Dee Night\\", or \\"A Hard Day's Night\\".<br />The real treat is that the majority of songs aren't on any other Beatles album.  They cover songs by Arthur Alexander, Chuck Berry, Buddy Holly, Little Richard, Carl Perkins, and Elvis Presley, to name a few.  Basically, these two discs show what groups and artists influenced the Beatles.  However, there are songs that are already on their studio albums, such as \\"Things We Said Today\\", \\"You Really Got A Hold On Me\\", \\"I'm A Loser\\", and \\"Ticket To Ride\\".<br />They capture the spirit of the originals.  Foe example, John sings \\"I Got A Woman\\" by Ray Charles and it's a 50's rockabilly number.  \\"Keep Your Hands Off My Baby\\" is a Shangri-La's/Shirelles type number that could've been included on Please Please Me.<br />Well-known numbers that don't need any introduction:  Chuck Berry's \\"Johnny B Goode\\" and Elvis Presley's \\"That's All Right, (Mama)\\" and Chan Romero's \\"Hippy Hippy Shake\\" which they originally did in their days with Tony Sheridan.<br />Classic rock and roll with Chuck Berry's \\"Too Much Monkey Business\\"<br />Chuck Berry, Little Richard, and Carl Perkins in particular are given special note.

Chuck Berry numbers are done here.

B00005JL96|4.0|I've just received Lilo and Stitch on DVD as a gift. I had already seen it in the movie theater over the summer. Overall, it is an extremely entertaining movie--very &quot;un-Disney.&quot; This is a tale of a troubled, (and sometimes very difficult) girl who finds plenty of fun and adventure when she befriends an alien who was cast off from the the planet Turo. I've really enjoyed this. Now for those of you who complain about violence and poor role models, please note that this movie was rated PG. I applaud the decision to create a situation involving a dysfunctional family--very believeable.(Yes, sisters do act like that. Not positive, but that is, sadly the reality.) Also, if you dislke movies about space aliens, etc. you might not like this. Wondering why there are only four stars? The DVD itself is not all what it could be. What is lacking is  a more detailed account of how the film was made, etc. It would also be helpful to be able to change from widescreen to a full screen. I hear that Disney will rectify this by releasing a two DVD edition. So, if you are looking for a quirky, enjoyable film, check out Lilo and Stitch.

It was not the greatest book I have ever read, but it entertained me and was a nice break from much of what I usually read.  It is a fast read, and it brought smiles to my face.  I also enjoyed its synchronistic messages.  I would recommend this book.  When I have children I will definetely read it to them, and encourage them to read it as well.

Anyway... you really must have this movie with you.
0140177396|5.0|Inspired by Steinbeck's centennial celebrations last year, I picked up a copy of  \\"Of Mice and Men\\" because I had read it was a thriller of sorts. As a mystery fan and writer, I am always interested in sudden apocalyptic d&eacute;nouements. I read the book in a couple of hours and, let me tell you, I'm still thinking about it two days later.<br />The story of George Milton and Lennie Small - who was, in every sense of the word, a \\"brute\\" - develops fast up to its high climax, and its end hits you like a thunderstorm. They are a couple of illiterate men who travel together, going from ranch to ranch in the Salinas valley at the time of the Great Depression, and \\"buck barley\\" for a living. They have no home or family, but they have each other, and they have a dream, which is repeated as an omen throughout the story: to save enough money to buy their own ranch and \\"live on the fatta the land.\\" George, with a small physique, has assumed the role of caretaker of Lennie, who is mentally retarded but naturally (or unnaturally?) strong. This trait of his had cost them their last job, but no matter what, they continued to stick together, true to their dream and their promise of honest friendship. Two days later after they arrive at their new place of work, the picture is totally changed and - in order not to give away the ending - I'll say so is the dream.<br />This is an excellently crafted novella, where every single character, event and word has been assigned a key role; and only a writer as talented as Steinbeck could have achieved it. It no only takes full manageability of the writing craft, but also an implicit trust on behalf of your readers in order to accept such a moralizing tale. Personally I like Steinbeck's omniscience, and anyone who knows about the context of his lifetime would understand why he thought a writer should always offer something for the betterment of mankind.<br />\\"Of Mice and Men\\" offers a perspective into us. It is a rite of passage from dreams to reality and back, an understanding of the true nature of friendship and the shattering reality of its breakage, where the pieces can no longer be picked up because they are no longer important. A novel that will make you want to hug the people you consider your friends.lity and back, an understanding of the true nature of friendship and the shattering reality of its breakage, where the pieces can no longer be picked up because they are no longer important.

0812550706|3.0|Ender's Game is so full of excitement, intelligence, realism, and with such an interesting cast of main characters and a conclusion that evokes such mixed feelings, nominally triumphant but really tragic, it's hard not to love it. The battle room scenes were especially gripping with their detailed explanations rather than just generalizations. For that, and excellent science fiction, 3 stars.<br />There were at least a couple parts that were disturbing (Card argues in his intro to this 1991 edition that some childran really DO think and talk like Ender and the others, and I'm willing to accept that).<br />Without spoiling things, the world is not democratic; evil forces are in control is almost justified with descriptions of \\"peace and prosperity\\". Don't get me wrong but I wouldn't like a book describing a future under communism or facism and putting hope into that, saying that humanity experiences \\"peace and prosperity\\". Would you? The ultimate \\"hegemon\\" has quite a bit of blood (partially) on his hands. There are other characters who do some reprehensible things and get away with it. In the end, a crushing look at politics (as with war).<br />A supposedly more sympathetic character, Ender's sister Val, allows herself to be used by evil and never seems to completely atone for her actions. She runs away, is still the smiling kid who asks why she shouldn't be allowed to have fun, and doesn't seem to be bothered by the fact that she was so easily, hopelessly repeatedly, controlled, and helped mislead millions of people. This should have been better developed. She even partially justifies it, claiming that we all \\"fill roles\\" given to us by others. While this may be true, they are not the right words to be coming out of this particular character's mouth.<br />Well the book is entertaining enough but that entertainment seems overshadowed by pain and tragedy, all well represented within the character Ender, and the ironies that result. It draws in the reader very personally. I think it has to, because we are enjoying the \\"games\\" which lead to the killing, by reading the book, in that sense we are like Ender who is the actual doer.<br />Add these elements together, sometimes I think the troubled consquences are simply suppressed or put aside one too many times; the last chapter didn't happen soon enough and wasn't long enough; things went on too long too complacently when evil ruled politics and while Ender followed violence so far (wittingly or not). This is very troubling, because it suggests, despite evidence to the contrary, that the war was after all the centerpiece of the book, and that the other factors were simply the decoration, the after-thought, the accompanying philosophy that cannot exist without first military priorities or military victory. Which would make it a glorification, intentional or not, of violence, and evil. If you think I am crazy judge for yourself. I suppose I am sensitive to such subtleties because I have read one too many biased writings, and know how subtle and troubling these biases can be, even unconscious ones, despite facades that are presented..<BR>It was honestly that thought that kept me awake at night long after I had finished this book. Well, you can come to your conclusions, but while I am unwilling to certainly condemn, and can only express doubts, those doubts are enough to keep me from ever being completely comfortable with this book.
078322799X|4.0|With all the interest in Peter Jackson since his marvelous work on Lord of the Rings, this movie is bound to get a lot of renewed attention, and I hope lots of people will finally watch it.<br />First of all, the special effects, although fairly tame by today's standards, are really quite good.  There is a \\"grim reaper\\" type of character who flies around doing terrible harm thoughout the movie, and he is very nicely done.  It's kind of a precursor to the fabulous effects Jackson would helm for LOTR.  And the special effects were done at Weta Workshop, who also handled, you guessed it, LOTR!!<br />The story is fairly simple.  Michael J. Fox makes his living as a \\"ghostbuster\\", for lack of a better word, and it so happens he can see ghosts, and has a handful of them who help him out by created supernatural disturbances,which he can then stop for his frightened customers (and get paid handsomely too).  But he gets implicated in a series of mysterious deaths in his small community, and the plot accelerates from there.<br />The movie is more funny and clever than scary.  Although it goes for thrills, it doesn't go for chills too much (although there are a few scenes late in the film with Jake Busey, playing a serial killer, that are a bit creepy and probably earned the movie its \\"R\\" rating).  A real treat is seeing Jeffrey Combs (Re-Animator) as a truly deranged FBI agent, who looks like an SS stormtrooper, trying to crack the case, yet also losing his grip on sanity.  He's a comic delight to watch.<br />I would say the movie is maybe 10 minutes too long.  The pace sags once in awhile.  Also, the romance that blooms in the movie is a bit tepid...Fox was really never too good at generating heat.  <br />But overall, I highly recommend it for a fun, frantic and mostly unique good time.

But I was intrigued with the blend of jazz, pop and country and I kept listening. Now I can't get enough of Norah and the CD. I am completely head over heals infatuated with her music. I love the soothing laid-back phrasing and her simple, yet beautiful vocal embellishments.  Some other reviewers, often claiming to be jazz experts, have dissed Norah and the CD. I guess I can understand their views, but I disagree with their overall assessemnt. Sure, the piano and guitar riffs are weak, but this doesn't bother me. I just want to hear more. I have joined two Norah Jones listserves just so I can listen to live performances and other tidbits.<br />I am not going to compare Norah with other vocal greats. Norah has her own unique style and niche that defies characterization. I still love Sarah V, Betty Carter, Cassandra and Ella. I won't stop listening to Diana Krall, Jane Monheit and Karrin Allyson. However, at least for now, I can't stop listening to Norah.
0790729725|3.0|This is one of the greatest movies ever made. I used to watch this movie over and over again when I taped it off of HBO back in the day. The acting is great as is the cinematography and direction. You really get a good feel for all of the characters.<br />The bad thing is the DVD. This DVD for one does not have any worthwhile Special Features besides a couple of trailers, a couple of actor bio's and a few Production Notes. Where's the directors commentary? Where is the behind the scenes footage? I hope that perhaps they are planning on releasing a Specail Edition because this DVD does not do it justice. Also halfway through the movies you have to get up and flip it over to the other side. What up with that? <br />You could by the VHS for cheaper and not miss out on anything special.<br />As a movies its great, as a DVD I give it 1 star. <br />Here's hoping they come out with a better DVD version.
6304493681|5.0|This is the first anime film I've watched, so I don't have the usuals to compare to.  If this is in any way representive of the quality being produced, then, I'll be back.<BR>It tells an interesting story of cyberpunk origin that led down some plost twists that even left an old sci fi reader like myself surprised.<BR>The animation, artwork and musical score are flawless.
0684135051|4.0|My boyfriend says &quot;at least the book isn't called 'knitting without killing your partner'&quot;. Although I did actually cry when I couldnt get the hang of anything in the book to do with needles and wool, I've finally reached an even balance. I can knit, just not the way she tells me to. OK, I do actually like this book now, lots of useful stuff but just takes a bit of getting used to her &quot;conversational style&quot;. Just a pity the book got slightly ruined when i threw it against the wall.
B00006HBUC|4.0|This movie is based on the highly successful Hanna-Barbara cartoon series.  It stars Freddie Prinze Jr. as Fred, Sarah Michelle Gellar as Daphne, Matthew Lillard as Shaggy, and Linda Cardellini as Velma.  The plot revolves around the group's mystery solving team, Mystery Inc.  The group has split up after differences among the members surfaced.  However, two years later, each receives a letter from the owner of Spooky Island, a hot spring break resort.  Apparently, some supernatural forces have been at work on the island, and the group has been summoned to see if they can help.  However, each does not know that anyone else has been invited, so its a shock when everyone arrives at the airport and discovers that they're all going to the same place.  Will everyone be able to put their differences aside and solve the mystery?<br />I thought the acting in the movie was pretty good overall. However, I thought Fred's character was too preppy and self-involved. Sarah Michelle Gellar does a good job as Daphnie, and Linda Cardellini makes a perfect Velma, but this movie belongs to Matthew Lillard.  His portyayal of Shaggy is top notch.  He even sounds like the old Saturday morning character that we grew up with.  His relationship with Scooby is just like I remember as a child. The computer animation is well done, and Scooby Doo seems almost life-like.  This is a fun movie and brings back a lot of childhood memories.
B00006LLJ4|2.0|Goodness! They actually made a DVD out of this?! The movie is only good the first time around. If you haven't seen this on the big screen, then get this, but don't expect to watch this more than once... it's very boring. The action scenes are NICE, and so is the story and computer graphics. And Tom's acting leaves a lot to be desired. Since ol' Steven made this, I thought it was OKAY, but the ending is really GOOD, the first time around. Watching it again made the movie boring since you can see everything that led to the impressionable ending of this movie. All in all, this movie is less than OKAY. If you don't believe me, go buy it and waste $22 bucks... lets see, what could I have done with my $22?
B00006CXXU|5.0|When you are as talented as Christina's album reveals, you don't need to dress sleazy to grab people's attention. Your music will do that by itself.

B000000WCX|5.0|David Bowie is a genius, plain and simple.  I am a musician that writes electronic industrial music, but likes many different genres of music.  This album is an amazing pallete of sound, thought and sound engineering that many artists today simply cannot acheive.  When I first bought this album, I had also just purchased ChangesBowie.  I was blown away by the imagination that this artist has at 50 years of age!!!  It's not too dark or to pop influenced, but brings together so many different styles, it makes my jaw drop.  This is the BEST album from Bowie in the 90's!!!  Truly, this is ahead of its time and only in the years to come will people see this as mainstream.
B00005QIPH|5.0|really good music to just have fun with. every track is quality...no tracks i skip over. one high-energy ride from beginning to end.  it's become my favorite driving cd.
B00005QIPH|3.0|This record came to me in the mail by surprise so I had no expectations when I popped it in the changer.<br />Listened all the way through and let it cycle about five times before I had to turn it off.<br />It's not great headphone music but it's great for grooving around the house or in the car.  Honest indie rock, highly listenable.
B0000009RT|4.0|An incredible recording, important listening and socially relevant to the time that it was recorded. Many artists/musicians have undoubtedly been inspired by 'The Mothers' (I hear a little of Alice in Chains during the dual vocal intro into &quot;Who Are the Brain Police?&quot;). The first half is actually preferred listening, because the tunes are both silly and musically interesting. The orchestration is definetly 'of that time' and the 50's-ish pieces are also, but I really feel some connection to tunes like &quot;How Could I Be Such A Fool?&quot; and &quot;Anyway the Wind Blows&quot; (and I wasn't even alive during the style's hey-day). <BR>  There is plenty of social commentary on tunes such as &quot;I'm Not Satisfied&quot;, &quot;Trouble Every Day&quot; and so on, addressing concerns, like suicide, depression, lonliness, and insanity. Coupled with silly tunes like &quot;Wowie Zowie&quot; and &quot;Your'e Probably Wondering Why i'm Here&quot;, and you'll start to get an idea of just how diverse this recording is. The 'far-out' experimental pieces during the 3rd and 4th 'acts' aren't very listenable....funny and interesting at times, but I personally wouldn't run the last 25 or so minutes of the album very often.<BR>  I certainly cannot go without mentioning the sound quality. It was, of course, recorded in 1966, so there are problems. Also, the master didn't quite transfer very well to CD, yet the more recent re-issues have addressed most of the concerns. Actually, for when the music was recorded, it's actually very good. The recording isn't as reliant on special effects and tape manipulations as later releases, so it's a much more natural sounding recording. <BR>  As it's been mentioned before, if you're new to Zappa's music, get his greatest hits CD, or something like &quot;Hot Rats&quot; or &quot;Over-Nite Sensation&quot; first. This is something that fans of early rock music, rhythm and blues, Motown, and doo wop will love, as well as fans of music that addresses social concerns.
B00005YW4H|5.0|This is an excellent CD, introduced to my husband and I at a recent Christmas party.  My husband went out and bought me the CD the very next day and I have it on every single day.  I don't think I will ever tire of Norah's wonderful voice.  This is one of those CD's where you actually listen to every track unlike other artists where one might skip a few tracks and only play the popular tunes.  I recommend Norah Jones' CD &quot;Come away with me&quot; highly...in fact I'm travelling to Ireland soon and plan to take 5 of them with me for friends.
B0000214F0|2.0|This film is a great example of Malcom McDowell's finest acting. Even Helen Mirram does quite well (if not up to par with her later roles)....however, the script is just terrible, the supporting cast is horrible, and the plot is just ridiculous. I give props to Guccione, Brass, and etc. for realistically visualizing Rome at the time of Caligula, and for the truly outrageous and elaborate sets, but everything else just doesn't cut it.<BR>  As a porno, this movie is just dandy. There is a 10 minute lesbian scene, and a roughly 10-15 scene that features an orgy. This is only about a total of 30 minutes of hard-core material, and for a movie that goes on for nearly 3 hours....well, what can I say? I didn't watch the movie solely for the adult material (I did find out about the film from Penthouse magazine, so I knew what to expect, though!): Malcom MacDowell, Peter O'Toole....people like that just elevate the films that they appear in, and this is the case. In THIS case, an abyssmal flick is raised to the status of tolerable flick.<BR>  As far as extras go, i'll give the film an extra star. A lengthy 'behind the scenes' featurette from the late 70's is informative and fascinating, particularly for giving the viewer an oppurtunity to see what went behind the construction of the massive, multi-million dollar sets. It also offers a rare oppurtunity to see Bob Guccoine in person, speaking about the film (even if he is garbed in chains and a leisure suit!). The actors' perspectives are also great. Beyond this, not much else....you can listen to the soundtrack without the speech, and it is truly a massive and powerful score to the film, nearly on par with the 40's-50's epics. A commentary track with either Guccione or McDowell would be great, but I suppose that perhaps the latter may have dis-associated himself with this picture over the years?<BR>   Watch it for the quality acting. Watch it for the `adult' material. By no means should you watch it for the gratuitous violence(it's just horrible to look at, and i've seen plenty a gruesome movie....seeing a man gutted isn't my idea of entertainment), grainy film transfer and appaling screen play. I hope to see Mr. McDowell one day star in a big-budget film of his own...it's been much too long.
0066214122|3.0|I was completely caught up in the first half of the book.  His story and character development were typical top notch Crichton.  Then the last half of the book became a rerun of previous Crichton novels.  Not giving anything away, but it sure seemed at times like I was reading a combination of Andromeda Strain and Jurassic Park all over  again.
B00006690G|5.0|...This is such a good album that everyone should have it.  He talks about some serious situations and I think that it's awesome coming from a man who shows no mercy.<br />This album is very, very, good.  And he is better than most rappers out today!  I rank him highly up to Jay-Z and Nas and all them other cats because they all are very good rappers!  The only problem with this cd is..........that there is no problem...Peace out folks!
B00006LLNV|5.0|Just as the movie was absoltely encaptivating, so is this soundtrack from Elliot Goldenthal. An eclectic mix of Latin and Mexican sound, I found myself wanting to tango! This is sure to get many awards.
B00004T9UF|5.0|This album is simply good!  Very creative and replay value is awesome!  What else can I say?  This is like a light Illmatic cd.  Well make that dark because Em' talks about killin' his wife.  But this is a good album because Em' says stuff on this album you wish you could say to every problem you have ever faced.  He doesn't hold back and that what makes this album a classic! Peace
B000063UR2|5.0|May I suggest that 'surround sound' is turned off???<BR>As all the other reviewers seem to be concentrating on the presentation and not the content of the film, here's my twopence worth. <br />Definitely not a kid's film, this is a dark, sensual adult film of the age-old theme of the devil wanting darkness to take over the world - requiring the services of a virgin and a unicorn. The visual effects and photography are just brilliant, given the era this was made in - you can see Ridley Scott's influence and imagery in the latest Lord of the Rings films. <br />The acting is superb; <BR>young Tom Cruise (as Jack) brings off the young lad charged with the task of rescuing the Princess and destroying Darkness with a grace and style that belong to a veteran; <BR>Tim Curry is in his best-ever role here, (even better than Frankenfurter!); the stifled undercurrent of rage is barely held in check as he woos the slightly-willing princess; one is almost convinced by him as he declares his philosophy and aims - \\"No Good without Evil; no Love without Hate; no Innocence without Lust...\\" in that rich chocolatey voice; and his laughter and dismissive tone as 'the BOYY!' Jack confronts him sends shivers down one's spine;<BR>and Mia Sara (whatever happened to her?) is both innocence and seduction, and believable in both roles, but her forceful rejection of the Lord of Darkness is as powerful a piece of acting as you will ever get.<br />Altogether a classic of film-making - seeing it again after several years makes one realise what a masterpiece this is!<BR>Unreservedly recommended. *****
B00000163G|5.0|This cd is like putting two Illmatics together and making the beats better.  This has to be the best rap cd ever.  And that is a understatement folks!<br />This album is so good that I don't see why a person wouldn't have this in there collection at all.  I just can't believe Tupac made this cd in such a short time.  If Tupac actually sat down and planned everything out for this album.......This would be the Ultimate album.<br />But cuz of short time......ah what can ya do?  This is a good album by far though.  The only problem I have with it is that........there is no problem and that makes me really mad.  Peace!!!
0316666343|1.0|This is a very interesting concept. I'm not sure what the author wanted to do. What type of story she wanted to tell. To me, it did show me a view of life as seen by a young person. While it was interesting, to me not very compelling. I read it and re-read some of it trying to see what I missed Not sure what!<br />I've read many authors in a variety  of fictional reading. This story I found lacking in something. Not every author can write for everyone. Unfortunately, this one was not for  me.
B000023VR6|5.0|This is going to be short!  This album is very, very creative and I didn't have to skip a single song on this whole album.  I agree with everyone who liked and recommended this CD.<br />Ah if you read my review of the first \\"Chronic\\" then you know that I gave it a four for it's replay value!  Well that is out the window here folks!  This album you can play over and over again in your car with the big subs! Peace out folks!!
B000002KIQ|5.0|There are a few releases that stand out above the others. Jazz is certainly one of them.<BR>It is very hard to classify the music. Is it blues, jazz, rock?<BR>All of the above?<BR>Whatever the genre, Ry is most definately a master. And whatever the genre, this album fits into the top 10 list of all time greats. <BR>Don't be surprised if, after hearing it, you add it to your top 10 list as well.
B000003AEB|5.0|I am not going to say much because you will read other reviews and they will say the same. This is a must have!  If you don't have this then.....I don't know what is wrong with you!<br />This CD is so good I don't know what to say.  It's better than Dr. Dre's Chronic.  Some people may argue with me on that but the truth is that this album is so old but the replay value is so good.  Enough said for one day. Peace!!!
B00003CXAA|4.0|This set is a dream come true for Godfather fans. It has all the films, extra footage, and interviews. I would have given the set a 5 star rating but for some reason, there's lots of extra footage that you see in the &quot;Godfather Saga&quot; that was made for TV that is not included in the set. (Yes, I know, even though the write-up says the extra footage is included, any hardcore fan that knows every scene of the saga will easily identify that much of the extra footage for the &quot;Godfather Saga&quot; made for TV, is not there.) Why? Some of that footage is excellent and really fills in lots of scenes that were too brief. If I could buy the &quot;Godfather Saga&quot; on DVD (or on VHS for that matter) I would but for now, this is the best they got.
B0000029GA|5.0|I am pretty sure that you have read the reviews for Illmatic and I have to agree with all of them.  This is a great lyrical album and was probably even hotter back when it first came out.  Nas was truly ahead of his time on this album.<br />This album also debut a rapper named AZ, who is a very good rapper.  I recommend anyone who bought this album to also pick up any AZ albums considerin' the fact that AZ is basically a student of Nas. <br />Overall a classic, must have album.  All the songs are perfect and if you think about the time this album came out....this was a good production album also. Peace out folks!!!
B00005JKG9|4.0|Anyone who has ever been in commission sales will be able to relate to some aspect of this film. Its' brilliant characterizations take from commissioned salesmen that can be found anywhere. <br />The reason I didn't give it 5 stars is that it moves a bit slow and I would have liked to have seen a longer film with the salesmen going on more sales calls. But, it's a brilliant film nonetheless.
0375823360|5.0|I just want to say that I think this is a very good trilogy, it deals with religion and what ifs, and makes you think.  I'm a Christian and believe in God, but I think those of you who won't read Harry Potter, or these books because they have something even remotely against God are narrow-minded, I respect your strong faith, but I think you should at least look at it as a chance to think about or discuss religion.  <br />Also, if you don't think your child should read these books, I think you're missing out, these books could provoke good discussions about God.  You might learn that your child is even more fiercly religious than you after they read this so-called \\"blasphemy,\\" then again, maybe Christianity in't the right road for them, God gave all of us free will, for good or bad, you need to allow your child(ren) to excercise that free will, and chose God or another path.  <br />I hope I won't be hunted down for writing this, but this is what I believe, and will continue to believe until someone shows me why I should believe otherwise.<br />And, once again, please keep an open about books, and give these a try, you might just surprise yourself with questions you never thought about before.
B000002LJW|5.0|Having contributed to a lot of bands' albums and concerts over the years, Eric Clapton has amassed a group of friends who also happen to be first-rate musicians.  Never being one to assume that he alone makes his albums great, Clapton routinely gives them a lot of room to write and perform.  True since Clapton gave up the solo on \\"Layla\\" to Duane Allman, it works for him in spades on this album.<br />Jerry Jeff Williams, a Texas songwriter with whom Clapton has had many fruitful collaborations since the Eighties, wrote several of the originals, standouts being \\"Pretending\\" and \\"Breaking Point.\\"  The first song has the most confident, tension-free vocals Clapton has committed to a studio album since _461 Ocean Boulevard_ more than a decade earlier; its low, bluesy verses and suddenly louder choruses seem written specifically to Clapton's strengths as a vocalist.  As was true throughout the entire album, Clapton taps the midrange boost on that custom Stratocaster and burns through the solos and fills.  If this record did nothing else for his fan base, it proved that Clapton had overcome his early-Seventies fear of overplaying or repetition; not until _24 Nights_ would anyone hear Clapton having as much fun as a lead guitarist again.<br />As the Amazon reviewer pointed out, he remained rooted in a bluesy context throughout, juxtaposing the faithful treatment of Bo Diddley's \\"Before You Accuse Me\\" with the sophisticated Robert Cray minor blues of \\"Old Love.\\"  While the production remains extremely clean, no one could accuse Clapton or any member of his supporting bands of not bringing enough soul to this particular session.  Aside from \\"Run So Far,\\" which indulges Clapton's taste for cheerful and insubstantial country, there's not a weak song on this album.  If you had to purchase five essential records by him not including box sets or anthologies, this would rank among them, below _Layla and Other Assorted Love Songs_ and _461 Ocean Boulevard_.<br />Well worth owning for fans and enthusiasts, and an excellent place to start for people who really liked _Unplugged_ but don't know where in his thirty-five years in music to start.
630463949X|5.0|I have always enjoyed listening to Stevie Nicks solo and never knew much about the Fleetwood Mac days or the songs they did as a group. I bought this DVD simply because of my desire to see more Stevie Nicks. I have no idea how good the music of the Fleetwood Mac days happened to be.<BR>I enjoyed the show completely with the exception of &quot;Tusk&quot;. I guess I just didn't get it. But the rest of the show was great. If a person is a Stevie Nicks fan, as I am, this would be well worth adding to a collection.

B00006AUIG|4.0|Beyond it's initial shock factor and delightful creepiness, Session 9 offers, in it's final words, a lesson. Though not readily apparent, the 'darkness' preying on weak and the wounded conjures up for me the Jungian spectre of accepting the shadow-side of our personality before it eclipses the rest of it's host. Session 9, with it's characters who exsist in bitter denial of their own natures, is not only a well done movie- but well worth watching again.
0553801511|5.0|There two things that are just horribly wrong with this book.<br />1) It's way too short.<br />2) It makes me that much more impatient for the book that follows it!  (It's really going to seem like forever till then, now....)<br />So, to say it better: I want more, I want more...  Definitely!
0060207051|5.0|I am 26 years old, and I still keep a copy of \\"Goodnight Moon\\" in my room.  Margaret Wise Brown and Clement Hurd tell and illustrate the goings-on of the world as the night comes upon us...<BR>This is a book that will ease any child into a goodnight sleep...dreaming of the \\"bowl of mush\\" and comforted by \\"the old lady whispering \\"hush\\" that Goodnight moon tells us about.

0060507772|4.0|It's not so easy to assess The Last Hero. Terry Pratchett gets top billing as the storyteller, but the book is largely the work of illustrator Paul Kidby. Not that the tale (a chronicle of the heroic attempts of Rincewind and his colleagues to prevent the destruction of Discworld as Cohen the Barbarian seeks, with the rest of the Silver Horde, to go out in a blaze of epic glory) is dull. Yet, the small-ish amount of space given over to yarn spinning does not allow for the virtuosic narrative sweep (and dust mopping) typical of Pratchett's full-length works.<br />On the other hand, the drawings of Kidby, who usually gets a cover credit at best, are witty and artistically astounding (although readers who wish to form their own visualizations of Rincewind, Leonard da Quirm, and other Discworld regulars are advised to avoid The Last Hero), replete with their own versions of Pratchett-style puns, references, and inside jokes.<br />Discworld fans will find plenty of allusional nuggets, including Apollo 13, The Right Stuff, Casablanca, The Ring, arras work, Michelangelo, famous gladiatorial phrases, The Last Flight of the...something--Icarus, maybe--and a whole lot more.<br />Overall, The Last Hero is a worthy addition to the library of any Discworld aficionado, or at least to his coffee table.
B00006JJ1O|5.0|Of course, the cd is great they are lesbains, everyone likes lesbians.
B00003CXE7|5.0|what can i say? this movie is so amazing I was left breathless by the end of it. This movie just blows away any competition which is hundreds of miles away at the best. Ben Her and \\"Fall of The Roman Empire\\" look like pathetic messes in comparison, and are also quite boring. To be fair though, i can see the directors vision in those movies but as far as it coming onto screen as something decent, those failures don't even do that. But gladiator on the other hand is a historical epic to top all historical epics. The acting is as fine in this movie than in any movie ever brought to the silver screen. The story is absolutely facinating. Russel Crow is the most uniqivically the best actor of alltime. I can't say enough about this movie, just go and buy it before you see it! You will be blown away.
B000003TA4|5.0|I heard smells like teen sprit once, i put it on repeat and sat there until the fourteenth time or so and then listened to the rest of the album which is just as good.THE BEST ALBUM EVER MADE .BUY IT NOW YOU FOOLS, EVEN IF YOU ALREADY HAVE IT.
B000066NW0|5.0|Talented is the best way to describe Avril.  I was blown away to think that she wrote these songs.  The album is really good.  She has a nice voice and sings with a lot of feeling.  You can tell that the songs come from the heart.  This album and artist have a lot to offer.  Hope her next CD is equally as impressive!
6304044836|1.0|The 1995 SABRINA was marketed as a remake of the 1954 Audrey Hepburn-Humphrey Bogart-William Holden film--adapted, of course, to modern sensibilities but not necessarily \\"improved.\\" I'll confine my remarks to those parameters.<br />Can you have a \\"Cinderella story\\" in a democracy? The original fairy tale and film were set in a world of strictly defined class and gender roles which the protagonists struggled to transcend. There is no snobbery in the world of the 1995 Larrabees--the fuddy-duddy senior Larrabee has been conveniently dispatched, the matriarch is a tough-talking old broad but good at heart, the chauffeur Fairchild (whom Bogart bemusedly called \\"a terrible snob\\" in the original) drove the elder Larrabee \\"with the partition down\\" for years but never improved his near-Cockney accent. There is really no death--Sabrina's suicide attempt (which viewers on this site found too gross) has been expunged.<br />Nor is there cruelty. In the original, David/Holden is the younger brother gifted from birth with all the graces, which he uses to satisfy his yen of the moment with the assurance that someone will clean up after him. Sabrina/Hepburn goes to Paris a child (presumably fresh from high school; David speaks of her two years later as 22 but is probably boosting) and returns as glib and beautiful as David himself, fully aware of the harm she's about to do. The film is about her redemption by kissing the frog.<br />The remake fudges all of this. The dance at the Larrabee home to which Sabrina gets herself invited the night of her return was originally a party celebrating David's engagement, at which his neglect of his fiancee for the stunningly gowned Sabrina upset both families, threatened the planned merger and prompted Linus's intervention at the tennis court. In the remake David's fiancee is in California for a medical conference, reducing the conflict to an \\"I don't like the looks of this!\\" on her father's part. Sabrina's grand entrance has been replaced by herslipping aboard unobtrusively as one more pretty girl; she's more Judy Garland than Princess Grace, confiding her fears to David's sympathetic Mickey Rooney.<br />Going off to Paris for two years (to study cooking, Sabrina's late mother's calling, rather than \\"find herself\\") was tantamount to exile for working-class people in the Fifties (the middle class might manage an annual visit home.) Why Sabrina's benefactors sent her off to work for VOGUE in a klutzy hairdo and dirndl (she'd be perfect as the Village bookstore clerk in a remake of FUNNY FACE), and why she didn't get a trim till she came home, I can't imagine.<br />Julia Ormond was most appealing in her smiling-through-tears scenes near the end, but I never really believed her conversion. David/Kinnear asked Linus/Ford the pivotal question after Linus had finished extolling the virtues of his beautiful, intelligent, socially committed fiancee--\\"Why don't YOU marry her? DON'T ANSWER THAT!\\" The answer is, of course, that all the problems would have been solved and there would have been no SABRINA 1995.
B000075BFK|5.0|To many of u are burning this album instead of going out there and buying it.

B00005QB42|5.0|A beautiful, souful, spirit-touching piece of art!
B0000844I8|4.0|It starts out great but then comes to a grinding halt as it flirts with racism and then moves to an idiotic 'American Calvary to the rescue' storyline...<BR>I was amazed to learn that: originally a Trilogy of STARGATEs was planned, but the idea was nixed when it came out that Devlin & Emmerich stole the story from an Egyptology student some years earlier, and had to settle out of court....also, the film was originally 3 hours long, but was cut ...and shame on Artisan-they idiotically made this DVD flat on the second, SE edition of the film instead of Anamoprphic like it should have been.
B00006AW2E|4.0|While this is an excellent Stones album, if you've already purchased it (or the US version), I don't recommend buying the new remastered one--I could hear almost no difference.  Here and there you can pick up a little piano not audible on the earlier version, but that's about it.  On the negative side, the remastering, in my view, actually hurts a couple of songs, especially &quot;Hitch Hike&quot; and &quot;Mercy Mercy,&quot; because in both Charlie's bass drum seems more muffled, less big than it used to be; the mix is smoothed out, but that's not necessarily an improvement.  I've been buying a lot of these remastered discs (consumer sheep that I am), and it isn't until you hit &quot;Aftermath&quot; that the new versions are really worth the money.  But at that point, they start to get exciting!
B00006LSM3|4.0|Well, I guess it's my turn to write my reaction to George's last album.  Love it!  Not as good as All Things Must Pass, but stands up well to all of his others.  I would have liked more guitar solos.  Gems on this album for me include:  Any Road, Pisces Fish, Stuck Inside a Cloud, Rocking Chair, and, surprisingly, Between the Devil and the Deep Blue Sea.     Listening to this reminded me that there are only two Beatles left.  Let's hold on to  all that they have given us musically.     Geroge, we will all miss you...........  Get the record and listen to it often!
B000002GXX|3.0|Riding on the success of the number one hit Best Of My Love, the album One Of These Nights was very warmly received by record buyers all over the world. Its considered to be the album that broke them through to commercial success (as if their string of previous hit singles didnt exist). Unfortunately, for an album that is supposedly a breakthrough for the band, it comes off as fairly spotty and mediocre. Sure it spawned three top ten hit singles, but it also contains some filler.<BR>  The best track by far on this album is the hit title track. One Of These Nights is a funky R & B induced rocker about the perils of trying to find the perfect woman. The song is propelled by a fluid rubber band bass-line that would induce any anti-disco freak to dance and features some killer guitar licks.<BR>  Journey Of the Sorcerer where they enter into a little Led Zeppelin mysticism with help from Bernie Leadons psychedelic banjo. Its a highly imaginative piece.<BR>  The stately ballad Take It To the Limit is also a plus for the album. It reaches a little into Philadelphia International soul territory. Compare Take It To the Limit to Harold Melvin & the Bluenotes If You Dont Know Me By Now.<BR>  The cynical Lyin Eyes is where the album seriously lags and nothing after it lifts it up to a substantial degree. Many hail this song as a tour de force in country rock. True the instrumentation is tasteful and nicely arranged and the melody is strong. However, the melody is also highly repetitive which wouldnt be bad if the lyrics told an interesting story (i.e. Wreck Of the Edmund Fitzgerald).<BR>  However, the words, the story they tell and general attitude towards women are the worst aspects of this song. From the beginning it says City girls just seem to find out early, how to open doors with just a smile. That sets the tone and the attitude that city women are nothing but manipulative whores through the whole song. And this particular woman gets her just desserts when she finds her life is so empty after marrying a man for money and then two-timing him. <BR>  For over six minutes Lyin Eyes drags on in classic soap opera style (hey! we got the point after the first three verses). At best, Lyin Eyes is an inferior retread of Tequila Sunrise (at least that one is less than three minutes long): at worst its so extremely misogynistic that Im surprised that womens groups havent stood up and bitched about it.<BR>  No matter what anyone does, it is hard to pull any album out of that pit.
B000002UAU|5.0|This disk has taken some knocks recently, but it's still a great recording from a great band.  I would rank this in my top three Beatles disks, along with &quot;Revolver&quot; and &quot;Abbey Road.&quot;  These guys just put out so much great music.<br />Having mastered the three-minute power pop nuggets on &quot;Revolver,&quot; the Beatles then stretched things out a little.  Sgt. Pepper's LHCB is the result of wonderful studio experimentation and brilliant songcraft.  Every song sounds different, and the instrumentation within each song receives different touches.  Yes, parts sound dated, but when the LP debuted it was 1967 and the &quot;Summer of Love&quot; was on the way.  In 1987, when the compact disk was still relatively new, this was a must own for your collection.  You have to listen to this one on headphones for true appreciation.  The music moves away from the standard two guitars, bass and drums format, but there are some great performances, and perhaps Paul's most inventive basswork ever.<br />This set also broke ground for several reasons.  It's been billed as the &quot;first concept album&quot; and for the first time printed lyrics where included on the back of the record jacket.  It was also the first gatefold album and had Sgt. Pepper cutouts.  There's also that great cover.  In college we played a game to identify all of the personalities, and were relieved when the list was included with the cd.<br />The music:<br />1.  Sgt. Pepper's LHCB:  The intro piece is a great Beatles rocker, with super electric guitar lines and Paul's raw lead vocal.  Mix in the orchestra bits, crowd noise, and refrain led by John and you have a classic.  4 stars.<br />2.  With a Little Help from My Friends:  Having Ringo sing as &quot;Billy Shears&quot; was a stroke of genius, especially with the line &quot;I'll try not to sing out of key.&quot;  This is still a signature tune for Ringo.  Great bassline too. 5 stars.<br />3.  Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds:  Trippy keyboard intro and Lennon lyrics &quot;plasticine porters with looking glass ties,&quot; great dynamics of voice and instrumentation and this is a classic.  Dated, but still a classic.  5 stars.<br />4.  Getting Better:  Great guitar riff, now best known on the Philips electronics commercials.  Great twisty line:  &quot;getting better all the time, can't get no worse.&quot; 4 stars.<br />5.  Fixing a Hole:  An underrated Paul tune, with introspective lyrics, great guitar and harmonies.  &quot;I'm fixing a hole where the rain gets in, and stops my mind from wandering...&quot;  4.5 stars.<br />6.  She's Living Home:  This one drips with syrupy sentimentalism, with all the harp and lush strings and overwrought vocals.  Some days I like this song, but often I skip over it.  3 stars.<br />7.  Being for the Benefit of Mr. Kite!  Lennon's swirling, whirling circus piece, with lyrics apparently lifted directly from an old poster he found in a shop.  Cool bass and drumlines.<br />3 stars.<br />8.  Within You Without You:  George's sitar-driven contribution.  Long, slow and dreary, but interesting string arrangements.  I sometimes skip this one too if I'm not in the mood.  3 stars.<br />9.  When I'm Sixty-Four:  One of Paul's &quot;granny tunes&quot; with<br />clarinets and 1920's dixie jazz style.  Catchy melody, singalong lyrics, cool bassline.  4 stars.<br />10.  Lovely Rita:  I like the haromonies and guitars on this harmless tune.  3 stars.<br />11.  Good Morning Good Morning:  Roosters crowing, waxpaper comb saxophones, and a propulsive beat.  Funny dirty old man lyrics.  Cool guitar solo.  3.5 stars.<br />12.  Sgt. Pepper's LHCB Reprise:  More driving than the intro version, with good harmony singing to move the disk toward closure and bring back the theme. 3 stars<br />13.  A Day in the Life:  Maybe one of the best songs the Beatles ever recorded.  Haunting lyrics and singing by John Lennon, especially in the &quot;dream&quot; part.  Excellent drums and bass, with gradual changes in pace and tempo.  Masterful use of the building orchestral section.  5 stars.<br />The Beatles masterpiece?  Maybe, maybe not, but a disk well worth owning.Masterful use of the building orchestral section.  5 stars.<br />The Beatles masterpiece?  Maybe, maybe not, but a disk well worth owning.
B000002GVO|4.0|Many feel that at this point the Eagles sold out. Sold out from what? They were never an underground band or a band that was on the cutting edge. Because of their desire to be the world's greatest rock band, the commercialism was always there from the first album. That doesn't mean that this is a bad record. In fact, it's one of their best.<BR>   After eighteen months of the revolving musicians shuffle and probably bunches of squabbles, the Eagles finally released \\"Hotel California\\" late summer in 1976. With guitarist Joe Walsh enlisted as a bona-fide member, the Eagles rock on with a much-improved album.<BR>   The title track `Hotel California' is truly inspired. A creepy sci fi storyline about a hotel that seems like paradise which turns out to be a negative Utopia) is sung over a relentlessly played killer guitar riff with variations in rhythm punctuation, dynamics and acoustics (instead of variations in melody, chord structure and key changes). But it works for this song: a relentless melody for a relentless storyline. Joe Walsh shows off some dynamite solo guitar work for the long fadeout. Yes, it fades out with the same relentless riff to indicate that you can't escape the final words \\"you can checkout anytime you like, but you can never leave.\\"<BR>   `Hotel California' became to the Eagles what `Stairway To Heaven' is to Led Zeppelin. `Hotel California' is Don Henley's most inspired piece of writing and is the best song on the album. But don't let that stop you from enjoying the rest of the song s here.<BR>    Rockers like `Life In the Fast Lane' are first class. Two noteworthy ballads in Joe Walsh's gorgeous `Pretty Maids All In a Row' and Glenn Frey's hopeful `Try and Love Again.'<BR>   Two of the more disposable tracks are `Victim Of Love' and  `New Kid In Town'. `Victim Of Love' plods along in typical competent Eagles fashion but offers no bonuses in development.  The top ten hit `New Kid In Town' is a nice melody about being the latest famous flavor --poignancy for teenyboppers everywhere. <BR>   However `Victim Of Love' and `New Kid In Town' do keep the flow of the album going smoothly and are both ten times better (and less offensive) than the worst track on \\"One Of These Nights\\" - the hideous `Lyin' Eyes'. And that should count for something.<BR>   From this initial release with Joe Walsh, it seemed like the Eagles were on their way to a brand new productive phase. Releasing a great Christmas single shortly after with their tender rendition of Charles Brown's `Please Come Home For Christmas' backed with their own New Years from Hell in `Funky New Year'.
B00003CXZ1|2.0|I love Angelina Jolie but I just don't buy into her being able to beat up 10 men without a single scratch on her body. <br />She also does not do enough acrobatic moves in this moves. At the beginning she does a flip from a rope. That flip looked very foney.<br />Her lines are way too brief. Her conversations with the other actors take one minute or less.
B000002UWL|5.0|Having heard just a few of PSB's songs before the fall of 1990 (mainly the hits), I was totally unprepared for the sheer brilliance displayed here.  I borrowed a friend's copy (he was lucky I gave it back to him!) and was totally won over.  Most music made with electronic instruments is cold and sterile, but there is an amazing amount of warmth here.  Several of these songs give me goosebumps each time I hear them, such as \\"To Face the Truth,\\" \\"Only the Wind\\" and \\"Jealousy.\\"  There is definitely a feeling of melancholia in the air in these songs, but that simply gives them resonance (I wonder how long an album of \\"happy\\" songs would stay fresh?!).  At such a cheap price, if you have not taken the plunge with this CD, put on your swim goggles and dive in.  The water's warm..
B00005JLSC|5.0|The audience consisted of kids younger than my kids and mothers older than my mother and everyone in between.  Men, women, girls, guys -- and all enjoyed to the point of a standing ovation and waiting to see each and every last credit. The line in the ladies' room after was very long and full of excited chatter as no one wanted to leave during the film for one moment.  Renee was phenominal and Catherine so superb it made you wish you saw more of her.  And Richard Gere, who would have known???  Can't wait to see it again.  Can't wait to buy the DVD.  Can't wait for the CD to come out.
B00000G2V7|1.0|I had enjoyed George Michael in Wham!  Great enthusiasm, sense of fun, humor, camaradarie ... which seems to have been lost when he started to take himself seriously.  With an ego to rival David Lee Roth, his music suffered when he was no longer hungry for the applause, and started dismissing his fans as beneath him.  Everyone knows the stories of how he treated the roadies, so they left him to his own devices; without that back-up, he lost much face and many fans.<BR>This is a sad attempt to revive a drooping career and raise his PR, which everyone seemed to know except the Superstar himself.  Fellow musicians contributed in many ways on this release; Elton John did a wonderful job of trying to make Michael appear talented, and the Great Aretha Franklin donated her amazing voice to this &quot;best of&quot; set.  <BR>The sad thing may be that this really is the best of what he now has to offer.  He had the talent, and any older releases that are untampered with are still good, but the rest is a waste of money, and a disappointment.<BR>There may be better times ahead; let's hope so.  The musical community can only support him for so long before he has to do it for himself.<BR>I would suggest trying some one you never heard of before instead of wasting the money here; give some new musicians a try and know they appreciate your support, not shun you for not having an equal vocal range.

0380789035|5.0|Neil Gaiman, American Gods (Harper, 2001)<br />It is hard to tell, from the Gaiman resources on the net, exactly how many novels for adults Gaiman has written on his own. Two? Three? More? In any case, Gaiman spent the five years between his novel Neverwhere and this one very constructively, it would seem. All the many flaws of Neverwhere have disappeared, and we are left with a stunning achievement, perhaps the first (horror? fantasy? What is this, anyway?) novel of its ilk that can be called truly original since Kathe Koja unleashed The Cipher upon us over a decade ago.<br />Shadow is a man just into his thirties whos spent the last three years in prison. Hes released a couple of days early thanks to the death of his wife. While flying home to attend her funeral, Shadow meets a man who calls himself Mister Wednesday. Wednesday tells Shadow a storm is coming, the offers him a job. Things are all downhill from there.<br />Well-drawn characters, a perfect pace, plots and subplots by the score, red herrings, masterful clue-dropping, double-crosses, triple-crosses, and of course, a plethora of gods, brought to America on the heels of their believers and left to be abandoned. The prose is more readable than that in Neverwhere, which was also a pleasant surprise; this one feels like it needs to be a movie, not like it was written from a movie script (which, in essence, Neverwhere was). Theres nothing wrong with the book, save a minor editorial glitch (a barefoot Shadow at one point reaches down and takes off his shoes). Its somewhat ironic, but ultimately understandable, that a book that goes to the heart of America so well was written by a British author. As one of the other characters observes to Shadow early on in the book, no other country spends as much time looking for its soul as America. Perhaps were better off letting others look for it. Gaiman has certainly done a more than capable job at finding it.<br />The first of the years reads to be a shoo-in for the top 25 of 2003. **** ½hoo-in for the top 25 of 2003. **** ½
B000070WJE|2.0|I purchased almost all Robbie's albums and DVDs, but this one is really way disappointing.<BR>He definately wants to try everything but he totally lost his style this time.<BR>If I heard these songs from the radio, I won't believe they are from the great star in Singing When You're Winning. The music is restless and in trand, but could be from any 20 year old new comer.<BR>Maybe the right thing for Robbie to do is to escape from his success for sometime.
B000002O96|5.0|From the moment the first track plays you can tell there's gonna be alot of hard blues action. to me all seven tracks are considered classics.
6305508550|5.0|Great humor always has elements of the truth. This movie is a cult classic. Watch it and you'll identify some of the characters from your own office experience. Let's face it, for the most part work [stinks] and Office Space does a great job of poking fun at all the reasons why. I especilly identitified with the themes surrounding the printer. I hate printers and copy machines with a passion. I loved the part where they take a baseball bat to the evil machine. And then there's the boss, Lundbergh - we've all worked for someone that smug and sleazy at one point or another. They you've got the crazy co-workers whom you're sure are certifiably insane. This movie hits the nail on the head in so many places! Buy it and laugh!
0802130208|5.0|This is the best book ever written in my opinion. As simple as that.
B00005OWEG|4.0|If you like films about the Vietnam War for the action and tension, you'll probably love the first half. After that you may find it an effort to stay engaged. The film's length alone is not for the faint hearted, or for the casual movie-goer who only sees this film in the context of a war flick.<br />It's essentially an examination of external and internal human conflicts: among peoples and within ourselves. Generations of artists have explored conditions in which our worst natures flourish; and war, where we see horror at its greatest scope and extent, is often the perfect canvas upon which to portray man's darker side. For Coppola, Milius and the rest of the creators, Vietnam encapsulated 20th Century America's conflicts.<br />The further Willard and company go up river, the less the story is about the war or Vietnam. Deeper into the primordial jungle--into the realm where Kurtz has unsuccessfully sought refuge from his own demons--the war, civilization, even time itself become suspended. It's a place where air power, the signature extension of American military prowess, is useless (note the downed helo and fighter jet); where armies battle with arrows and spears; where death is delivered by one's own hands (use of machetes to kill Chef and Kurtz) instead of from a distance. In the end it asks all of us, 'Before you judge, what would you have become in such a place?'<br />I was very curious about the extra footage, having heard about it in 'Hearts of Darkness'. And I at first found the French plantation episode, while ghostly and mysterious, definitely intrusive and unnecessary. <br />When I saw it a second time, I noticed that the segment begins and ends with identical shots of Willard on the bow of the boat riding into (or out of) mist. The set up and conclusion of a dream sequence, perhaps? An imaginary Vietnam where Willard can find warm food, clean clothes, opium and sex? Is this his Elysium, where he'll go once he dies? It's certainly better than his reality. Whether intentional or not those clever visual parentheses tell me that the inclusion wasn't gratuitous.<br />As for the other additions, I'm mixed. Kilgore's obsessiveness over surfing (and his surfboard) is so overdone, and to such unbelievable excess that he becomes a caricature. His comic, yet menacing behavior is replaced by plain, vanilla-flavored looniness; just another Vietnam War kook. Ho hum.<br />Also seeing Kurtz for the first time in full daylight, when he releases Willard from the hot box, only serves to diminish his mythic persona as a nocturnal, predatory beast. Not only do we see is very un-Green Beret and immense girth, we also seem him like some New Age Laguna Beach burnout on a fashionably-Buddhist jungle retreat.<br />But I'm very pleased with the restorationa and transfer. The entire work has given me more food for thought on one of the most complex American films. But oh, do I wish there was a commentary from Coppola, Milus and Sheen.
B0000696I0|5.0|Well, it wasn't like the first one, a different person played April, and there was no Casey Jones (*sniff*). You also have to suffer through Ninja Rap by Vanilla Ice (Go nin-ja Go nin-ja Go!) But you have to admit, it was still pretty cool. You get to find out how the TMNT's got their names, there's a fighting asian pizza delivery guy named Keno (who appears to be an awesome fighter on-screen), and a nice new hideout. There are also some mutant beasts for the Turtles to defeat. And there is more pizza than ever. Don't let Vanilla Ice scare you - see this movie!
B000050XEI|5.0|Again, Enya comes out with a remarkable piece of art in New Age music.  Being that I am a major New Age guru (Yanni, Enya, etc.), I can say that I really enjoy this album.  Through just Enya's voice and a simple synthesizer, great works of art are put through to the human ear, and the effect is just remarkable.<br />On each track is something to be enjoyed of, and I highly recommend this album to those who enjoy types of classical music, New Age music, and even those who enjoy easy listening music.  You will not regret this album.
B00006F7S4|4.0|Beck moves from his usual formula of semantic play on this album for a more recognisable lyrical format. I think it is basically an album for Beck fans but the uninitiated can still appreciate it, but I don't think they'd really get it. He is a musician certainly above his field, which is probably why you won't see him in many top 50 countdowns. Anyway, back to the album. It just sort of strolls and meanders along much in the same vain as Mutations with some busy picking and sensational orgestral moments that build and dissipate at will. His Elmer Fuddessque drawl works once again and with such a tongue-in-cheek classic as Lost Cause it's a sure winner.  Other highlights include Guess I'm Doing Fine and Lonesome Tears.
B00005QG9J|4.0|Incubus's &quot;Morning View&quot; shows their great sound with traditional guitars and a drumset, but also a bit of new sounds with reverb and DJ effects, which makes up Incubus's unique style.  Each song has its own great sound to it, from 11am's melancholy sound to Wish You Were Here's rock sound to Mexico's acoustic guitar song, this is a great must have for alternative rock gurus.  I highly recommend this album.
0060925000|5.0|When someone presented me with this book as a birthday present, I thought I would never tackle it.  I'm glad I found the time.  The story that Seth has woven is gorgeous.  Being of South Asian decent, I had to remind myself several times that this book is not set in the present day because there are so many traditions which have remained intact for the last 50 years.  I found the talk of politics educational, yet tedious, and would anxiously await the story to return to the lives of Lata, Maan, Meenakshi and Saeeda Bai.  <br />This book was a true delight to read, and after getting thru 1400 pages, I was sad to see it end.
B00006G8K0|3.0|Couldn't agree more with the previous reviewer from Florida who compared the paltry extras on the new \\"Horror of Dracula\\" (1958)DVD with the truckload of goodies included with the previous release of \\"Scars of Dracula\\" a latter hammer movie in the same series (1969).  The only thing he didn't mention of course is the releases are from different studios which is the main reason that the two films were treated so differently.  Anchor Bay released \\"Scars of Dracula\\" and its a good example of how they have been steadily improving their DVD product.  I have a fine laserdisc release of Hammers \\"Dracula, Prince of Darkness\\" (1966) by Anchor Bay complete with \\"correct\\" widescreen imagery, running commentary, trailers and behind the scenes footage.  It is such a complete package that I didn't feel the need to get their DVD release of the same film (at least not yet) as the laser was such a nice package.  Even Anchor Bays VHS releases of Hammer films under their license I found to be above average.  Hammer films have been licensed for release and distribution by secondary companies like Anchor Bay and Image as well as several major studios who own the various titles such as Twentieth Century Fox, RCA Columbia Tri-star, Metro-Golden Mayer, MCA-Universal and with the \\"Horror of Dracula\\" (unfortunately) by Warner Brothers.  <BR>    <BR> To give Warner's due credit, the films colors and overall appearance are not bad and the transfer doesn't exhibit any major problems, except one.  To the previous reviewer who said that \\"Horror of Dracula\\" is in the correct widescreen aspect ratio, I hope you no longer drive a car.  It is obvious in the second shot of Christopher Lee, his head is cut off, that as with \\"The Mummy\\" Warners in fact has over-matted the film which was probably only a modest widescreen production to begin with.  Comparing it to the VHS, virtually nothing is added to the sides and signifigant information is trimed off the top and bottom.  The framing is so tight on thetop that heads are cut off in several scenes.  What really galls me though, considering that extras amount to a trailer and a couple of pages of text is why we didn't at least get a pan and scan along with this \\"widescreen\\" editon.  Considering the short running time of the film and that its a dual-layer disc this would not have cost them much at all and they have done it for many other releases either by utilizing both layers or releasing a single layered dual-sided disc, they cost about the same.  Warners has done this for many other films.  Well, enjoy what there is. Thanks, CAL
B00006IUNN|4.0|This is probably the best action war movie i have seen in a long time in terms of all out gungho fighting scenes from the very beginning of this movie to the very end. 'We were soldiers' had alot of action in the second half of the movie but this one is non stop action...WOW!!! The director knows what action thriller fans want to see and he does a great job at it, like always. Granted, this movie is not about a in depth history on navaho indians wind talkers during WW2 and how they were groom into the corp, which is what everyone had expected to see and did not get. This is the reason why they criticize this movie soo much. I agree that i was looking forward to that too but it is also not fair to rate the movie based on that. This movie is about Nicolas Cage and yes it is very Hollywood, but so is Saving Private Ryan. Big Deal..I like hollywood movies and you don't like it, then don't watch it. If you were smart enough to see who directed it, you would've knowned it would be action pack which is what you get with Cage smack in the middle of it. Besides, i thought he does a good job protecting his windtalker, considering what he want thru in his last battles before getting injured. I like to see you do better. The visual is very good with convincing realism in the fighting scenes. The plot is a lacking but that is not the director strong point, but he knows how to make a great action war film, and this movie accomplished it so admireably.       <br />If you like John Woo's Mission Impossible 2 action during a historic world war with excellent visual affects plus very grusome blood and body part scenes (on par with SPR Omaha Beach scene), then you will love this movie. If you prefer a good plot and more knowlegeble discussions on windtalkers, then read a book on it *roll eyes*.<br />I love MI2, and i love this movie, but i will give it only 4 stars because i do agree, the plot could've been better. Let's not make Nicolas Cage as a big hero like John Wayne in the GreenBarets because he is no John Wayne. Nevertheless, he is still a good actor in my book.
B00003CXFG|5.0|My hubby forced me to watch this movie. Now he has to force me to stop watching it. I loved it(so did hubby)! A really great mental escape movie. If you want to have fun and not think, this movie is for you. I loved it so much, I bought the DVD. I also bought Vin Diesel's other movie XXX. BTW, Vin sizzles! I can't think of anyone who could've played the lead character's role (Riddick) any better than Vin. In the movie, too bad Riddick and Caroline didn't get together. But then again, if they did, that would've detracted from Riddick's murderous persona and possibly affected the movie's overall impact on the audience. But a kiss wouldn't have hurt (even a quick and forceful one).<br />AWESOME! AWESOME! AWESOME! A must for your sci-fi collection!
B00005JKES|1.0|Sadly, the absence of the pilot episode really hurts the value and appeal of this collection.
B000069AUI|4.0|There's not much to say about this album.  Though it was almost the victim of too much pre-release hype, and it took me a good few listens before my ears adjusted to the band's harder (than their 2000 debut album) sound, I have to say this is a great record, hands-down.  There's nothing that Coldplay does wrong here.  These guys are masters of balance.  It's great in every area, from lyrics, to composition, to production and mixing.  nothing is ever over- or under-produced, played, or sang.  I wish I could come up with something critical to say, to make this review a little more interesting, but it's just a great and exciting rock album.  The best cut is the rollocking and captivating \\"Clocks\\".
6305842442|1.0|I still cant understand why people have such a problem with the original version of this film -- I actually prefer watching it with the voice over.  I am not saying the directors cut is bad -- quite the contrary -- its still an excellent film. However having both versions of this title would be a big plus.  To the would-be buyer -- I would hold out until the studio releases the definitive Blade Runner pack -- including both the studios release and the directors cut - THEN decide which one you prefer.
0060537639|5.0|Academics have long accepted the notion that Zheng He's fleet reached only as far as Zanzibar on the east African coast. They just assumed that his fleet turned back from there. This new book challenges that assumption and has gotten a lot of knee-jerk mauling for it. But the question that no critic has asked is: Why would Zheng He's fleet turn back at Zanzibar on the African east coast? Zanzibar has been said to be located either in present day Tanzania or Mozambique, depending on certain perspectives. But the point is: Whether it's Mozambique or Tanzania, Zheng He would undoubtedly have seen coastlines stretching further into the distance, because neither Mozambique or Tanzania is at the tip of the African Continent. So the question is why would Zheng He fleet, massive in its capabilities and size, tasked with traveling to the \\"ends of the Earth\\" and \\"uniting the world in Confucian harmony,\\" turn back at a very arbitrary point called Zanzibar on the eastern coast of Africa? <br />Furthermore, before you jump to a conclusion in answering that question, there's something else to be known that definitely places the question into a mystery. In a BBC article on November 12, 2002, titled \\"Africa's Oldest Map Unveiled,\\" the map was a Chinese map of the entire African continent dated back to the year 1389, long before the first Europeans arrived and even before Zheng He was born. The name of the map was \\"Da Ming Hun Yi Tu\\" or \\"Almagamated Map of the Great Ming Empire.\\" You can read the original article at the ... BBC website...<br />So, after you read the entire article, in light of the hitherto unknown facts, you couldn't really say that Zheng He's fleet turned back because they thought that they had reached the end of the world, could you? So finally, again, I pose the question that I have heard no knee-jerk attacker or critic ask: Why do you think that Zheng He fleet turned back at Zanzibar?
B0000797IO|1.0|I can't believe Jennifer Aniston agreed to be in this movie - it was far from a comedy as the back of the DVD states.  I guess &quot;Good Girl&quot; is a sarcastic title - and not only saying that it is far fetched that someone like her would be married into the lifestyle portrayed in the movie - but how could she really think of starting a life with Holden and not see that he is a complete wack job who has become obsessed with her.<br />I really must admit that her acting was very good - but the movie was just terrible.  It was simply unrealistic with her making ridiculous decisions - either she was desperate for money - desperate to be in a film - or just so out of touch with how &quot;little people&quot; live that she couldn't see that the movie was a bad choice.  Just watch Friends and leave this one alone.
0671027573|3.0|I always enjoy LH's books but I find the plot of this is a little weak.  The way the list captured the attention of the media was too far-fetched, as if there was really nothing spicy enough for the media to go crazy at all.  The chemistry between Jaine and Sam was great though, always fiery and surprising.  I wish there were more pages allocatd to them, they only sort of got to know each other towards the middle of the book.  After building up such an intense chemistry between them, the sex scenes were a bit disappointing.  Sam appeared to be turned on by the spirit of Jaine but Jaine appeared to be more fascinated with the physical beauty of Sam's body.  So the romance was a little superficial to my liking.
B00006F83Y|5.0|this cd has lots of good songs. Dave grohl is awesome on the drums. Before i bought it i had only heard no one knows i thought that that might be the only good song. I was wrong because pretty much every song is good. Also the drums and guitar music is really good. I think you should buy this cd.
B00006LLNU|5.0|What can you really say about this album?  You have to hear to get it, and even then, the beauty is that you don't get it--you can't get it.  When you do, call your doctor and tell him you're ready to be admitted.  This is most easily the most beautiful record of the year, and the most unusual.  Sigur Ros is a band from Iceland who have come up with their own singing language.  It is not clear if these \\"lyrics\\" even mean anything to the band itself, but it is clear that a lot of passion has gone into crafting each of these songs sonically.  I'd like to meet someone who could listen to this album without having an emotional experience of some kind.  Or, then again, maybe I wouldn't.  At any rate, the music is something of its own: a little rock-and-roll, a little symphonic, and just a little bit of fellow Icelander Bjork's off-kilter rhythmic nonsense.  Split into two halves that are seperated by an obvious silence, ( ) is even more abstract than 2001's Agaetis Byrjun (that translates Fat Cat in English):  the band didn't even bother giving these songs names.  You'll have to settle for knowing that Tracks 1 and 2, and Track 8, with its sprawling, epic soundscaping, are the best of the best here.  Comes complete with a blank lyric booklet in which you can write down your own interpretations of each of the eight tracks.
B00005B36H|4.0|It's funny to read reviews of Tool by people that don't like them or think they haven't progressed. They haven't progressed??? Get Opiate and compare it to Lateralus, there's a huge difference.  I've listened to the \\"other\\" bands.  Neurois?? Please, yelling in yours songs doesn't make you brillant. They do have some good drumming and musically are on the same level as Tool. But Maynard's voice is far superior. This CD is smooth, not as great as Aenima. See these guys live and you'll see why they have such a following.
B00006JKLI|5.0|Especially if you are fan of Yes, just a casual listener, or just want a good workout for your surround system, you must run out and buy this DVD-A.  This is an incredible piece of work.  The surround sound mix brings out all the subtle nuances on the music, particularly Bruford's wonderful percussion fills, and Squire's rumbling bass lines.  What always made Yes so great was the ability of 5 musicians to be doing something different at the same time and have it all work together.  The sound field separation demonstrates this.  Go buy this disc!
B00005JL78|4.0|Well, it's one of the best sci-fi movies of the past years and Spielberg redeemed himself after A.I.. The story is good, photography is really neat, and the film just grasps you attention. If you're a sci-fi fan this is a must have.
B00005N9CV|2.0|I do think that Diana Krall is a talented musician.  She has good taste in her musical selections.  However, she is NOT a very good singer.  Her voice is weak.  Her diction is poor, and her phrasing is often sloppy and unimaginative.<br />I would consider the following women great singers: Lena Horne, Aretha Franklin, Ella Fitzgerald, Doris Day, Judy Garland, Rosemary Clooney, Julie Andrews, and Barbra Streisand. These are artists whose voices are multi-octave.  These gifted performers have the ability to exhibit power or subtlety consistently and appropriately. Their technical skills are immaculate (with the exception of Judy Garland in her later years when her substance abuse caused her to slur her words). These magnificent singers bring exceptional clarity, sophistication and originality to their interpretations of classic American pop songs.  They can infuse the music with profound emotion.<br />Diana Krall's vocals are superficial and pedestrian in comparison.  The quality of her voice is tenuous and inconsistent.
B000068TPN|1.0|pointless war plot, and pointless war characters. That's what this .... movie is all about. Mel Gibson has been made famous for battling against the British(Patriot, Braveheart, etc.)and now he has moved onto the Vietnamese.  <br />The Battle Scenes: The battle scenes are some of the worst ever filmed. Vietnamese soldiers just jump into open firing range and fall over fakely. It seems like the Vietnamese are on a suicide rage than fighting. And there's way too much of this throughout the entire feature. And one Vietnamese soldier just runs strait at the Americans until Mel blows his head off. The Vietnamese are actually smarter than what you see onscreen.<br />The \\"Family\\" Scenes: Of all the bad scenes in this film I have to say these are the worst of them all. All the wives are there, one has a baby, the father of course dies along with others, and all of this results in a sappy crying fit. The other scenes contain 2 women walking around handing out letters to other wives about their fallen husbands all with the same predictable results.<br />That's all I have to say. Don't buy, rent, burrow or watch this movie. It's a complete waste of time. Watch a good war movie like Saving Private Ryan, Windtalkers, Platoon, or Apocalypse Now. If you must see a Gibson movie watch Braveheart or Patriot. At least those have a decent storyline.
B00000K501|5.0|Because I live in a place where concerts, especially those by European bands, are virtually impossible-- I had never seen Rammstein actually performing before I watched this video.  I have no cable, and I have no MTV.  At this point, I have been able to acquire music videos...but Live aus Berlin was my first experience beyond a CD.  And I think that I fell in love the night that I watched it.  <br />Rammstein is a lot of things, but one thing they are not is boring.  It is a great shame that a lot of American music fans cannot appreciate this video because the intelligent lyrics are lost on those who do not understand them.  The music is good-- yes-- but not surpassingly so.  It is indeed moving and deep, but it's the lyrics, the fact that much of them are in archaic languages and rife with allusions to great poetry and culture; and, of course, the intensity with which they are performed that makes Rammstein truly great.<br />Firstly, I do not find them at all offensive.  Even their sexual antics on stage are silly at worst, not upsetting, and they generally are amusing and witty.  The lyrics don't strike me as unpleasent.  Yes, they sing about unusual themes that are not generally accepted by the fragile norm.  People don't like to be rattled into thinking a little harder.  People don't like the suggestion that aesthetics can also lie in what they themselves find disturbing; like pain, fire, and yes, even death.  But we all need a little disturbing.  We have grown too static in our thinking.  Our only disturbances are typically of the annoying-- yowling bands that spit youthful anger and hate at us-- not deep, macabre suffering tinged with irony and dark humour.  Sometimes what is misunderstood about Rammstein is that a lot of Rammstein's songs are sarcastic social commentaries; not personal opinions.  Weißes Fleisch is not promoting rape or assault-- it's expressing the horror of such mindless violence.  After all, the mere mention of it in a song unnerves people!  The problem is, so much time is wasted in attacking Rammstein for daring mention what people don't want think about on their own...that time could be spent in doing something about the very real issues of violence, rape, and racism.  It doesn't go away if you ignore it.<br />Rammstein claims to want to cause a little trouble, but I don't think that that explains everything about them.  My own mother (yes, I'm one of the restless 17's) dislikes them because she finds them frightening.  But fire is an expression not just of destruction, but of passion; and also of love.  It is the raging of unstoppable, immense emotion-- like the sun, it can warm the heart or it can burn down to the bone.  <br />And I am not comparing Rammstein only to the other goth bands and rock bands and metal bands of this era, but also to the bombastic glory of Beethoven, the youthful madness of Wolfgang Mozart; and even to the melancholy operas of Verdi.  All these things are not Rammstein-- but Rammstein do share one thing with the masters of music:  majesty.
B00006M183|3.0|Not the best they've done for sure. Not to knock the guys, i'm a diehard fan, but come on where's EV vocals in this one.  There isn't a single song on there that gives my the chills like so many other songs from the past. When asked to describe this CD to people that don't have it i always say, it's a good cd for drinking to. This one sounds a little routine. I do like &quot;Can't Keep&quot;, &quot;Thumbing My Way&quot;, &quot;You Are&quot;, and Mike shines on &quot;1/2 Full&quot; and &quot;All or None&quot;.  I'm not too happy with this cd, but it doesn't matter because seeing them live is just unreal. The concerts are why I still listen to them.  As with Tool, see them live and you'll see why they have that many fans.
B00005MP58|5.0|Pride and Prejudice is my favorite novel of all time, as many other readers with pronounce the same.  When I watched this version, I kept an open mind, knowing that many movies do not do a book justice.  This adaption was superb, and was an utter joy to watch.  A few small aspects were left out, but it is already a 5 hour movie, and these changes do not alter the integrety of Jane Austen's classic story.  Not only was the adaption a delight, but the music, setting and actors came together to produce a seemless production in which any fan of the book would respect and enjoy.
0743424425|5.0|I'm not normally a fan of horror novels, but I must say I really enjoyed this. It gripped me from the start. It's the only novel that truly frightening novel I've ever read. Just like Joey from friends, you'll want to hide it in the freezer so the horror doesn't get you in your sleep! Buy it now!
B000007NYS|4.0|This is where it all began for Lucinda.  Several of the songs on this CD were made famous (or at least semi-hits) by other people, like \\"changed the locks\\" and \\"passionate kisses\\", which shows the respect other musicians have for Lucinda.  Later CDs display her maturity and evolution, but even this early one shows what a great songwriter she's always been.  Great album.
B000069CWE|5.0|Even though this is a remix cd of Hybrid Theory, each track still sounds great! There are places where the beats are different and where the lyrics are different but they still go together really well. This cd has been in my cd player for sucha long time I can't even remember. I just can't get enough of them! The day it came out I couldn't find it because it was sold out at the 3 stores I went to so I had to get it the next day [[which i found at the second store i went to because it was sold out at the first one]] This is a great remix cd and it's worth the money.
B000077VPU|3.0|I have the original broadcast I recorded from TV which is the best! The full show! I also have the Laser Disc version which is excellent and includes 3 songs from Metallica, The Guns N' Roses set and the best part (IMO) of the show, the fabulous Extreme tribute medley!Also the Laserdisc starts at the beginning! Whoever threw this edited and poorly transfered video DVD set, is out for the buck, not the fan! Hopefully someone in the Queen camp will read this and make a proper box set of the full concert!
0676973779|5.0|This is a well thought out story of life and destiny placed in an adventure similar to birth through death. The characters survive birth by being tossed into the sea from a ship accident, the characters all show their true colors while surviving life in the big sea. The rescue is intrigueing. I recommend a very good book which goes further, Sb 1 or God by Maddox.
0316666343|5.0|I have heard about this book for a long time and finally sat down to read it....and didn't get up until I finished.  It was sad, touching, funny and sweet all at the same time. It is hard to get through the first couple of chapters without crying, but well worth it.
B000001FAW|4.0|RIP too Maurice Gibb a Very Gifted Musician.I first heard this album as a kid my mom bought it&I Enjoyed it alot back in the day.\\"You Should be Dancing\\" was Slamming way before it even made it's way too \\"Satuarday Night Fever\\"&whatnot.\\"Subway\\" was the cut as well.I really enjoyed the Harmony,Writing&Production on this Album.
B00004Z459|5.0|Hybrid theory is the best cd I've ever heard, the way Chester and Mike blend together is just amazing and their songs are not like other rock/rap group songs, they have a very unique sound. I can tell that every song on the cd has had major work put into it and it paid off!!! All the songs have catchy tunes and make me want to sing along. Chester has sucha great voice and he puts alot of emotion into his parts so you can really feel what the song is about. Mike is an incredible emcee, he can make you understand the meaning of each song through the way he raps. Joseph[[Joe]] is a great DJ because he makes it all out of scratch and it turns out to be a masterpiece. The guitarist[[brad]], drummer[[rob]] and bassist[[phoenix]] start out each song and throughout the whole song which helps set the appropriate mood for each track. If there is one cd out there that is worth your money, it's Hybrid Theory.
0689835604|5.0|Our daughter loved this book and really learned from it.  We never made it a point to drill her on her body parts.  It came to a complete surprise to us when we were reading this book with her and she started showing us her own body parts along with lifting the flaps.  At under a year she could identify hands, mouth, feet, etc. Great buy!
B00006CXXU|5.0|what a pleasant suprise!! chrstinas album is diverse, eclectic and mature! tracks:<BR>1. stripped intro, an intro with medlody, irony and a message. 9/10<BR>2. can't hold us down, with lil' kim, one of my fave's it is hip hop influenced, beaty and catchy with a kick-(butt) message. 10/10<BR>3. walk away, probably my favourite, a six eight ballad with some real gustoand some incredible vocals from christina. 9.5/10<BR>4. fighter, cleverly blended in from walk away, while its message is basically the opposite, it carries on from the theme of walk away, to the girl who is standing up for herself! this is great, a real rock tune! One of my faves! 10/10<BR>5. primer amor interlude, spanish lovey stuff. 8.5/10<BR>6. LOVE THIS!! infatuation, latino, great lyrics, catchy, a great sing-a-long song! 10/10<BR>7. love embrace interlude, english lovey stuff. 8.5/10<BR>8. loving me for me, not the best song of the album, but still good, sweet and soulful. 9/10<BR>9. impossible with alicia keys, melodic, soul, r'n'b, this is great! 10/10<BR>10. underappreciated, again, more soul influence, macy grayish kinda sound, but at the same time, unique. 9.5/10<BR>11. beautiful, probably her second release, this is GORGEOUS! its simpleness is its brilliance!! one of the best songs of the album. 10/10<BR>12. make over, another rock song, the great linda perry getting christina to branch out into different genres. love it! 10/10<BR>13. cruz, i think this song sort of ruins the album. 7/10<BR>14. soar, another one I don't really like. 8/10<BR>15. get mine, get yours, another more r'n'b type song, catchy and basey, this is a excellent tune. 10/10<BR>16. dirrty with redman. i dont need to say anything. you've all heard it, all seen the video. this is one heck of a tune! My favourite song at the moment! 20/10<BR>17. stripped pt 2, an interlude, sorry shes not a virgin,(***)and personal, 9.5/10<BR>18. the voice within, FANTASTIC!! i love this. starts off slow and mild, but later develops into a real hard hitting soulful deep song, fantastic vocals, shows us why she is not britney's rival, she is a superb singer in her own right who is going to be around for a lot longer. trust me. 9/10<BR>19. i'm ok. moving, quietly disturbing, but motivating. 10/10<BR>20. uplifing song, a nice final track, showing us that she is a real star! 9.5/10<br />great album christina, i expected it to be good, but this is fantastic, the best album i have listened to in a good few years! buy this people, if you like pop, hip hop, r'n'nb, a bit of rock, soul this album has everything you'll ever need!
B00005JKJA|5.0|This is the best film ever! The first time I saw it, I was a bit confused. I had to watch it again and again to really see what was going on. I thought it was brilliant for keeping the audience guessing. Sine watching the movie, I have done lots of research to find other people's interpretation of the movie. I recommend this movie to people who are tired of seeing the same plot play out in every movie. This one is definitely different. Thank you David Lynch.
0316666343|4.0|This book is beautifully written and lovingly rendered; a sensitive tale of survival after the brutal murder of a young child.  In spite of the harrowing nature of the crime -- which is sprung on the reader in the opening pages of the novel -- there is little that is sensational or distastefully done in this book.  Perhaps owing to Sebold's own experiences as a victim of violent crime, The Lovely Bones is a touching and heart wretching depiction of a marriage and family that is trying to mend itself back together after their daughter is murdered.  As a parent, certain portions of the narrative are absoultely painful.  And yet, the book is wonderful and uplifting in terms of how it shows a family coming back together and healing.<br />Still, this book is not for me.  There were many points in which I felt the descriptions were far too verbose and at times, unnecessary to advance the story.  I tend to be a more literal individual, and prefer my fiction to have similar tendencies.  While this book's literary merit can't be denied, it's not for everyone.

B000060MWU|3.0|The movie is Perfect ! there is no doubt about it, but the video in the Canadian version [is bad]! the VHS version is better in this matter, the audio is OK, the lack of special features is depresive, there's no caption or subtitles in any language wich helps in the beginning when the caracters wisper all the time. I suggest you contain your craves and wait for the american release, it's always better.
0375414053|4.0|I love all of the British ladies we are meeting and Kate Reddy is no exception.  She is a businesswoman, a mother, and a wife (in that order!).  She takes her job as the 'main breadwinner\\" very seriously, perhaps a little too seriously to get her home life in order.  Kate is constantly going off on business trips and leaving her small children with their nanny, Paula, who Kate is very jealous of. <BR>I didn't relate very much to Kate in terms of motherhood since I have no children.  However, I did relate to Kate and that want to succeed that she has.  She has the personality that you love and want to succeed.  She is funny, successful, jealous, and just a little sad.  It angered me how sexist the workplace was in the roles of gender and parenthood.  It really brought the light to my eyes.<BR>I think that Pearson did a wonderful job showing the journey that a working mother takes.  She lets someone else into her home to raise her kids, she obsesses about her job, she tries so hard to be there for kids, and she lets her marriage slide a little along the way.  As a woman who dreams about having a family of her own one-day, I envision what my life will be like.  I just hope it is less stressful thank Kate's experiences.<BR>Great book for a first time novelist and I can't wait to read the next book Pearson writes.
0060537639|5.0|Gavin Menzies has written a gripping tale that challenges history as we know it.  Everybody knows that Columbus sailed the Ocean Blue and discovered America, right?  Well, what if the Chinese were here 70 years earlier as part of a plan to colonize the world?  Would we need to re-write all of our history books?  This is what Gavin Menzies sets out to prove to the reader in an extremely engaging, lively, and convincing manner.<BR>     I thoroughly enjoyed this book.  It's fascinating and a lot of fun to read.
0385486804|5.0|This book really hit home for me.  I am an avid outdoorsman, and have often thought I should just strike out into the wilderness.  Would I have beter luck, or would I plan better than Christpher McCandless?  Maybe.  The truth is I live too comfortably to strike out into the hobo lifestyle.  I both admire and look down on McCandless for his adventure.  I wish I had the audacity to give up everything to go on such an adventure.  However, he was so stupid in his lack of preparation that he deserved to die.  I could not put this book down.  I kept thinking of my self in his situation, and thinking what if...???
6300208699|3.0|I enjoyed &quot;The Magic Christian,&quot; although I don't think it's an especially great film. Much of the cinemetography (such as a scene on a train in which things suddenly start flipping out and we see strobe lights and random weird images) seems rather dated now, and some of the humor that was shocking in its day (such as a Shakesperian actor doing a striptease) do not seem all that shocking today. There is a frustrating lack of dialogue and organized storytelling, problems which somehow the Monty Python films managed to avoid even though they too were mostly collections of sketches. Be all this as it may, Peter Sellers is his usual brilliant self as an eccentric billionaire who goes around getting people to do absurd things simply to prove that everyone has their price. Some of this is simply cruel, but some of it (especially when they get on board a cruise ship) is quite funny indeed. Ringo Starr plays along in an easy deadpan role. There are many (very brief) cameos by other stars. In the end, after this series of cynical vignettes, we are treated to a suitably sixties suggestion that &quot;there must be an easier way,&quot; which is quietly uplifting even in the midst of all this absurdity. Worth seeing once.
0316666343|5.0|I was completely riveted, moved and overcome by this superb book.<BR>I cried, I laughed - and read it all night, couldn't put it down. I entered this world (and heaven) created by Alice Sebold completely, totally forgetting where I was, and my own life. There is no higher praise that I could give a book, other than that it totally transports me, that I almost forget to breathe and move, and forget that I am reading. It haunts me - it is unforgettable.
6301969294|5.0|Ayn Rand's masterpiece novel loses none of its plot and pace in this, somewhat shorter, film production. The theme of the film is: the individual verses the collective. And the individual, in this case played by Gary Cooper in the form of Howard Roark, is brilliantly portrayed through a sense of self-belief, determination and sheer ability. His ideological opposite, Elsworthy Toohey, is also well acted and personifies the evil collectivist who renounces all individual achievements and believes that men should act as their brother's keepers. Then there are in-between characters too - those of mixed premises - such as Gail Wynand and Dominique Francon. All of these dramatic individuals play their part in a compelling and well thought through story.<br />Perhaps one of the most impressive (although unsurprising given the author) facets of the film is that it actually has an underlying message: it's not merely a concoction of disjointed and pointless scenes. The climax and meaning to the whole story can be found in Roark's own testimony at his court case: his statement and explanation that man exists for his own sake, not for the sake of others. <br />This is definitely a film for those who believe in the hero of man the creator, though it will, almost certainly, be too close for comfort for the collectivist crowd!

B000001ESF|4.0|The '70's were the heyday of progressive rock groups, and Rush was playing catch up with their idols, most of whom had released their best efforts by the time Rush's first disc came out in 1974. Still, prog-rock was viable and big business. For those who are students of such music, you can't go wrong with 2112. It is an essential stop on the road to all things prog, like Lamb Lies Down On Broadway was for Genesis, Brain Salad Surgery was for ELP, and Close To the Edge was for Yes. <BR>The album features the 20-minute concept about a futuristic time when all things artistic and creative are restricted, and banal lifeless societies exist among the planets of the Solar Federation. But one man finds a guitar, learns to play it, and incites a major riot among the leaders of his Orwellian nightmare existence. In the end, you don't know who quite comes out on top, only that &quot;someone&quot; has assumed control. Who wins? Who cares -- this is a great composition, sewn together by a flow of hard rock genius (Temples of Syrinx and Grand Finale are particularly strong) and softer, more contemplative moments (Like Discovery, with its gentle waterfall sound effects). Looking back, it is a little cheesy, and the ideas expressed were nothing new. Drummer/lyricist Neil Peart lifted the idea from Ayn Rand's novelette, Anthem (also the name of another Rush song). But you can't help but be drawn in by the story, laid out with short descriptive passages in the liner notes before each section's actual lyrics. <BR>The rest of the album is slightly weaker, and over time has lost some of its pizzazz. However, two bright spots can be found in the haunting, Moody Blues-ish Tears, and the Kiss-like in-yer-face rocker Something For Nothing.<BR>By now, the band had found itself, and all the basic elements of what would make Rush great over the next few years are laid out here: quirky arrangements, pseudo-philosophical lyrics, pile-driving guitars, jaw-dropping bass and drum interplay, and Geddy Lee's high shrieking lead vocals. <BR>But even Lee's vocals are presented in a way that is accessible, thanks mostly to the excellent production values of this disc. They and Terry Brown manage to strike a balance between capturing the rawness and youthful energy that made Rush such a high-octane act with a disciplined, clean sound. You can really hear the nuances of all the instruments well, and the disc simply sounds great. Guitarist Alex Lifeson shines here, with his finesse and power.<BR>This seemed to be the culmination of everything the band had been trying to achieve on their previous works, but had only been able to attain in part. Here, everything comes together to work as a cohesive collection. If you want to hear what Rush was all about in the '70's, start here. It's a journey worth taking.
6305212112|5.0|One of the most compelling things about Fried Green Tomatoes has to be the richness of the characters, each one with a definite and fascinating personality which shines through in this fantastic production.<br />Jessica Tandy, as usual, gives a sterling performance as the wise old lady who befriends overweight housewife Evelyn (the wonderful Kathy Bates) and, through the story of two young girls Idgie and Ruth, inspires Evelyn to make sometimes drastic changes in her own life. <br />The story is told on many levels: there's the actual story of the relationship between Evelyn and Ninny (Tandy) in the present day together with Evelyn's impact on those around her as her personality steadily changes; then there's the flashbacks to the story of Idgie and Ruth set against the backdrop of the usual social turmoil of the American South.<br />Above all, the story is one of friendship and the wonderful richness that friends add to one's life. A touching and extremely watchable movie.
B000002LQR|5.0|This CD revolutionized my concept of music. I've been completely enamoured with the entire CD for nearly 10 years now. As any sort of music listener, it completely changed my vision of music (What a ... metaphor... vision of music?) Each song demonstrates a plethora of musical genres and facets. Each musician demonstrates great skills but work as a whole, even letting their fallibilities shine without shame. The music is completely raw in tone. And there is so much variety in every facet of music with this, I guarantee you will not be bored.
B00006RCNW|5.0|I would have been just happy with having the first season but having just a little more is so incredible. All the audio commentaries are great and reveals that for a group of people who do such heavy stuff they are really a fun bunch. Even the little season two teaser which is just Michael Chiklis &amp; Shawn Ryan isn't bad either. Both behind the scenes featurisms, including the one from FX are bother excellent. My only complaint is that &quot;The Shield&quot; is not presented in wide screen. The deleted scenes are pretty cool to and check the after math of the child molester. Over all the audio commentaries are fairly enlightening as we learn to really appreciate the music of the show as one of the characters. So go out and buy this on DVD now because it rocks.<br />-Jason
B000001FRY|3.0|In the late '70's and early '80's, you had disco, new wave, some punk, and heavy metal to choose from as the most popular forms of pop music. Then in 1980, along came a quaint little Irish combo called U2. <BR>If you are only familiar with the band's headier work, such as Joshua Tree or Achtung Baby, this album will surprise you. It only barely resembles the band that would go on to dominate the world of rock. It is more akin to a skeleton upon which singer Bono and the band added meat as they grew.<BR>The basic elements of the band are here: Bono's soaring voice, while somewhat undisciplined, still is front and center, along with The Edge's rhythmic, jangly guitar landscapes. <BR>The songs are simple and exude an energy and newness that must have seemed very odd for its time. It really doesn't sound like anything that was around then. That alone made some folks take notice. <BR>Songs like I Will Follow, Stories For Boys, and Out Of Control have a certain innocence that evokes feelings of mourning for a diminishing youth. Other tracks have a slightly edgier (no pun intended) feel, such as the ethereal The Ocean, the sinister An Cat Dubh, and the foot-tapping The Electric Co. A Day without Me is a standout example of pure pop, with deceptive lyrics which seem to be about suicide.<BR>The production is stark and clean, and the songs seem to bleed in and out of one another.<BR>The only trouble is that the band's playing still has miles to grow, as do Bono and The Edge's writing skills. Also, about 2/3's of the way into the disc, the songs seem to all sound the same. The versatility wasn't there yet and some of the songs are forgettable. But it still works. It is a breath of fresh air at a time when music needed it. U2 may have still been flying under the radar, but they were creating a buzz. All in all, a great start for a great band.
B000069AUI|5.0|Coldplay's first album, Parachutes, was a hard act to follow: there can be no doubt, however, that Rush of Blood to the Head equals and maybe even surpasses its predecessor.<br />Each song is well composed and well performed. Indeed, it feels as if each song has been individually crafted and, as a function of this attention to detail, the album has a variety of pieces each different in terms of emotional tone.<br />There is obviously pure talent here - unlike so much of the manufactured garbage of today which poses as popular music.
0140186409|5.0|John Steinbeck is the most perceptive and creative authors I've read. I read Grapes of Wrath sophomore year, and it spawned a complete love of literature. This book takes the reader through an odyssey of emotions and troubled times. It so perfectly represents the 30's depression, and America in general. It opened my mind to the values of this country, and inspired me to see everything from a different eye. This is a book that will change your life. I will not vote for a president who has not read this book.
B00005OAIE|5.0|This is one of those CD's you can listen to over and over again- i've had it for 6 months now, and even though i listen to it almost every day i havent gotten tired of it. Buy it- you won't regret it.
B000002UAI|3.0|By the time of this album's release, Beatlemania was in full-swing, and it was more than the Fab Four could have ever imagined it would be. Constant touring and all of the other trappings of sudden fame were already taking a toll, and you can see it in the bitter title of the disc, as well as in the eyes of the four unsmiling, weary-looking Beatles on the cover.<BR>And for the only time in their recording career, their songwriting suffers from it all too. Maybe it was the pressure of filling the whole of the previous disc (A Hard Day's Night) with all original tunes, but here the Lennon-McCartney team fell back into the formula of the band's first two discs-- 8 original compositions alongside 6 cover songs.<BR>The band do manage to keep focused on the direction they were taking their sound, and the use of acoustic guitars and folky arrangements lace tracks such as No Reply, I Don't Want To Spoil the Party and the Dylan-inspired I'm A Loser.<BR>These tracks, along with the mega-hit Eight Days A Week, Baby's In Black and Every Little Thing are great, but not as strong as many of the tracks on A Hard Day's Night. <BR>The cover songs of past albums focused on the band's love of Motown music, but here they focus more on their interest in country and folk. There are two Carl Perkins numbers, Honey Don't, belted out by Ringo Starr, and the album's rocking closer, Everybody's Trying To Be My Baby, sung by George Harrison, who also has some great guitar moments.<BR>Other covers include the Buddy Holly song, Words Of Love, the fun Little Richard number Kansas City/Hey Hey Hey Hey, and the forgettable Mr. Moonlight.<BR>This album is more an example of a great band pausing to catch their second breath before moving on to bigger and better things. Good album -- after all, its the Beatles -- but not the best they have to offer.
0790731479|5.0|I recently saw the DVD 5.1 version of this film and it is excellent. The picture quality is, excuse the pun, picture perfect. The sound is very good on the surround but not much on dialog separation if any at all. But Alec Baldwin makes up for the rest. I have always told my partner that Alec would be the only guy in the world that i would leave him for.  I know it would never happen but each time i watch this movie my fantasy runs wild just like the movie itself.  This is just pure fun, pure entertainment, no thinking involved, no serious plot, no hardship, non racist, non potical just pure fun.  Get  it,,,,,you won't be disappointed.  If anything get it for Alec,,,,they don't get any hotter than him.
B00006LPER|1.0|I chose this movie in BlockBuster, because I like classical music and I am learning piano. I can understand that there are all kinds of people (I mean ALL kinds) in this world, but this is really distastefully beyond my imagination. <br />I realized that a horror movie does not always need killers or vampires. This movie really scared me with its distastefulness. Nevertheless, it made  me keep watching till the end, probably because of the superb performance of the actors/actresses. But in the end, I had to say, \\"Ew! Yuck!\\". And I was fortunate that I watched R-rated version. <br />The only good thing is that this movie showed some of my favorite  pieces such as Schubert's Piano Trio in Eb Op 100 and Brahms's Sextet in Bb.<br />There are movies which you wish you had not watched, because it's sick and disturbing. The movies like Mulholland Drive make you watch one more time even though they are clueless in the first view. This movie is also clueless but I just can't watch it again. I regret that I rented this movie.
080013558X|5.0|Okay, you lofty critics, come down from your tower.<BR>Having grown up with the original broadway cast recording until the movie came along (whereupon I instantly changed my allegiance), I am surprised that anyone could accuse Aileen Quinn's impressive singing as being too forceful, in comparison with the original stage actress, who, apparently devoid of any notion of musical dynamics, nasally belted out her songs like a pipe organ at full steam.  The musical numbers that were removed (NYC, Hooverville, etc) were primarily the ones that went right over kids' heads anyway - what modern seven-year-old knows or cares about the Depression? - and were rightly taken out to prevent boredom in the film's intended demographic target.  This may have resulted in less depth of setting, but I do not think it makes the movie any less enjoyable - on the contrary, it lightens things up considerably, if only the viewer can remove the purist chip from his elevated shoulder.  Simply admit that this film is a charming, light-hearted romp through smashing choreography, catchy tunes, and a bit of shmaltz pulled off with finesse by a perfectly-cast group of actors, and you have a film that will captivate your kids, and you, if you can grant yourself their innocence for a couple of hours.<BR>  Note: one of my favorite things about this movie version is that it gives Annie her red mop of curls for the entire movie, rather than having her unexplained transformation at the end (I presume just to identify her with the pre-existing cartoon character). No other version does this. A petty bone of contention, perhaps, but one to gnaw nevertheless.
B000002UAF|5.0|This album is pop genius. It was the first real example of just how great The Beatles were becoming. If Please Please Me was the &quot;ready&quot; and With the Beatles was the &quot;set&quot;, A Hard Day's Night is most surely the &quot;GO!&quot;. <BR>This disc was the soundtrack companion of the band's first film. The first half of this disc (side one for you vinyl folks) comprise the songs from the film. The remainder of the album is filled out by non-movie tracks. But don't think that this means they are &quot;filler&quot;. Almost every song on this album is a genuine joy to listen to and displays a blossoming songwriting team that was finally finding its feet and confidence. Every track on this album was penned by Lennon and McCartney.<BR>Classic tunes abound, from the foot-stomping title track to the catchy McCartney rocker Can't Buy Me Love. There is also Any Time At All, I Should Have Known Better and You Can't Do That, all of which are great pop/rock tunes.<BR>McCartney has another ballad, and this one was a great one, the sweet And I Love Her. Lennon reveals that there is a heart under that tough exterior on the short punchy I'll Cry Instead.<BR>Harrison sings a Lennon-penned little ditty called I'm Happy Just To Dance with You. <BR>The band seem to be exploring the use of acoustic guitars here, as can be heard on the aforementioned And I Love Her, and on the slightly dark Things We Said Today and the harmony-driven album closer I'll Be Back. These tunes set up what would come on the band's next few albums.<BR>There are two less-notable tracks, Tell Me Why, a generic sort of song, and the throwaway When I Get Home. But even with those tiny bumps, this album still gets 5-stars for the sheer brilliance, fun and energy bristling from all the other tracks. The Fab Four were still having fun, and it shows. This is an essential piece of early '60's pop, created by the leaders of a musical revolution. Get it.
B00006CXXU|5.0|Ms Aguilera's album was one of the best albums that I purchased in 2002.  If you can get past the front picture and hear her songs, you'd agree with me.  Her songs are a mixture of soul, rock, and even a little gospel in my opinion.  Christina has a really beautiful voice but she's so underated.  My favorite songs to play are:<br />Walk Away- She really proves that she can blow on this song.<br />Fighter- I can relate to the words in the song.<br />Underappreciated- Every one women can relate to this song.<br />Beautiful- This song is very inspiring and can get you through a hard day.<br />Get mine, Get yours<br />Dirrty<br />I'm Ok<br />Soar<br />Singing my song.
B00006F83Y|1.0|Here's the formula you should follow for becoming the next avant garde, innovative alternative band...Just write a bunch of wimpy generic pop songs and add heavy guitar riffs and extremely loud drums! You've just become the next Q.O.T.S.A.!!
0790736233|4.0|Hollywood grinds out yet another movie about making contact with an alien. Ho-hum, right? Hold on. This one is grounded in the real world for a change, not the la-de-da what-if world of a fantasizer (although those can often be quite entertaining; it's just that this one is refreshing because of the perspective of writer/producer Carl Sagan).<br />We see the struggle of the modern scientist to be taken seriously, the single-mindedness that marks the great mind, the helplessness of losing control of one's \\"baby,\\" all in the setting of a visually unique experience that's as dazzling as anything I've seen on film.<br />Yet it's also Sagan's perspective that spoils the experience on one level. His evolution-based theories have always caused him to be singled out for opposition commentary by those who believe in Creation rather than his purist form of natural selection. Therefore his story includes snotty religionists (Rob Lowe in a bit of bizarre casting, thinly disguised as Jerry Falwell) and mindless fanatacism masquerading as religious fervor (stunning role by Jody Busey, son of Gary).  This smacks of possibly a \\"strike back at them\\" attitude in Sagan's heart, as he seems to see ALL Christians now as wild-eyed freaks and self-righteous hypocrites.<br />Sagan's idea of presenting a balanced perspective toward those with religious views is to include a near-priest who dropped out because he \\"couldn't handle celibacy\\" and hops into the sack with Foster right away, yet is our Godly hero. Puh-leeze. Have to have sex to sell tickets, I guess, but that's seriously left field. Likewise the government people and department heads are all one-dimensional bad guys.<br />I continue hope in vain that the movie industry at large can one day manage to lose its prejudice against us with a deep faith in God, and thereby present Christians as real three-dimensional people rather than one-note props to play off of and treat as idiots, yet there is no doubt that the story of \\"Contact\\" ismoving and exciting, visually hypnotic and inventive. Obviously it does not commit the sin of boring the viewer; it's one you can debate after seeing it. <br />Further, major props to the makers for at least presenting the scientist herself even-handedly. She is not Ms. Perfect. That would have been unforgivable. It's a shame she's the only character in the entire story who really seems like a real person with complexities and a past. For a 2-1/2 hour film, you'd think at least one other character would have the hint of a personal history. Oh well, not everyone can create a Babylon 5 universe.....
B0000797IO|4.0|Aniston gives a terrific portrayal of the discarded wife.  Aniston nails the character Justine who is employed at the local discount store and whose pot-smoking, house painter husband leaves something to be desired.  I was reminded of a modern day cry of Betty Friedan. Justine doesn't realize that her destiny lies in her own hands and not in the hands of those around her. She seems in a state of emotional paralysis throughtout the film and my only gripe is that she would have found contentment along the way in herself. She needs a copy of the Feminine Mystique. Tragically moving and endearing you will be capitivated by Aniston's struggle with fidelity and emotional despondence. A must see!
B00000JPH0|4.0|The Soviet Invasion of Finland is a part of World War 2 that most people outside of Finland know very little about. Most history books give little more than one or two paragraphs to the subject and perhaps a photo of white clad ski troops. Although the ski troops fought courageosly, their action took place mainly in the central and northern parts of Finland near the Soviet-Finnish border and involved small units who took on much larger (and much more heavily armed) Soviet units, trapped and then systematically destroyed them.<br />This film does not deal with the ski troops but rather focuses on actions that took place in the south on the Karelian Isthmus. This is where the bulk of the Finnish Army was deployed and the battles that took place in many cases were reminiscent of World War 1 style massed infantry attacks. The film focuses mainly on the experiences of a small group of Finnish Army reservists. Being part time soldiers from the same geographic region they display an easy and informal familiarity with their officers and senior NCOs. This movie starts out a bit slow but the tension builds as the political situation deteriorates and the reservists (now mobilised) are left to wonder about what is to come, discussing rumours, worried but determined to stand up to the Soviets despite being vastly outnumbered.<br />The film is in Finnish with English sub titles which sometimes are not totally accurate but are still understandable.<br />Don't expect a big budget Hollywood production similar to &quot;Saving Private Ryan&quot;, but watch this movie with an open mind. It's well worth it.
B00005T5VE|5.0|all radio edits. not too bad. artwork is the reason i bought. it was worth it.
B00007BH3Y|5.0|The Philip Glass score was an essential part of the film.<BR>Yet the music really stands on its own with this CD. The Hours  is a kinder and gentler Glass that is accessible to people who are new to his music.  For those of us who are hard core Glass fans, this CD is also a joy because its so beautiful. The piano solos are my favorite. I really think Glass should win the academy award for this score.
0316666343|4.0|Alice Sebold provides a unique and at times haunting perspective on a child's death that will make you think. I wish that there were more redeeming lessons in the story, however. I just finished THE GRAVEL DRIVE by Kirk Martin and found that to be a more inspiring, redeeming book for parents. Either wya, you can't go wrong.
B00003CXI1|5.0|We have watched this DVD so many times we know it practically line for line! ...and we haven't tired of it yet. Of course the movie can never be as good as the book ...for one thing it would have had to been a bit longer ...not that we would have minded. The cutting out of some of the book left the movie with a few jumbled scenes that would have made more sense had they been included. Overall though it was a very entertaining movie. One part of the book that I wished was not overlooked was at the end when Hermione guesses the potion part of the spells that were guarding the stone (Snape was credited for his spell to guard the stone in the movie but it wasn't included in the movie). Also why cut out the Peeves character altogether and make the Bloody Baron a laughing fool? Anyways, can't wait for the Chamber of Secrets to come out on DVD!
0316666343|5.0|I had a hard time getting through the first chapter due to the realistic and gruesome details.  I was told to keep going.  Once I did, I was hooked!  I found myself waking up at night and my mind would go to the book so naturally I had to get up and read a chapter or two!  This book made you look at life through the eyes of a child and look at what heaven possibly could be.  Either way, it was a thought provoking novel which I highly recomend.<BR>In addition, The Nanny Diaries is also one that I could not put done but was totally different.
B0000033TE|5.0|This was another album from ELP that really defined their style of music.  Turning on my player to hear the thunderous opening to Jerusalem just blew me away and I knew right there that it was good.  And it will never get boring.  Benny the Bouncer, Jerusalem and Karn Evil 9 are the main attractions, but no song is to be overlooked.  This is pure ELP and is definitely a must own!
