B0000VAFNQ|5.0|This was an EXCELLENT MOVIE. I can't wait for the sequal!!! <br />Believe me when you see those vampires fight you just have to ask yourself &quot;Can Buffy the Vampire Slayer beat THOSE kind of vampires?&quot;. My answer is no...no...NOOO!!! Man if Buffy had to fight those vampires from this movie, she would be dead in a minute. Man they will take little Buffy and turn that woman out until she is dead. <br />Well...that is beside the point. However, this is a GREAT MOVIE WITH A GREAT STORYLINE ENOUGH SAID.
0060537639|3.0|The subject is fascinating: China and its commercial fleet and their voyages of exploration, and even more: China's high level of civization that the West took centuries to equal. The author, however, has to puff himself up and repeat how he discovered the information to support his view. The fact that he was a naval Captain and had visited the areas traveled by the Chinese and had technical knowledge about sea travel that other historians didn't, allowed him to put together facts thought to be unrelated. But we GET it. He did a great job, but better writing and editing would reduce the book and make it a more readable, and enjoyable experience.
B0000C1733|5.0|One of the best CDs I own - has the best compilation out there. A great buy!! Go get it
B00006ZCFH|4.0|Erykah strikes again in this potent mix of beats and instrumentations.  Instead of the usual thought provoking content we've come to expect from Ms. Badu, we're instead treated to a refreshing dose of live and looped instrumentality.  Ms. Badu expects us to FEEL her flava this go round with the beat rather than the word.  Several extra length tracks may not be for the faint of heart, and contribute to a slight feeling of redundancy, but overal, Erykah reaches a new level of depth once again.  I would definitely recommend you 'Bump' this on those days where you just want a groove to move you.
B00002MZ12|5.0|I find Alanis' lyrics to be humorous, thought inspiring, and the perfect combination to her individual songs. This cd was not one to disapoint. \\"No Pressure Over Cappucino\\" is brilliant and a new favorite of mine. I already own Junkie and Jagged Little Pill, so most songs were very familiar, but the slower and more soothing versions were well received. \\"King of Pain\\" is well done for a remake. It is a hard song to put a new spin on, but Alanis does it well. The cd was absolutely beautiful.
B00008AWOD|5.0|I honestly have to say that I believe this is the best Placebo album yet (and I love them all).  From the day I first bought it and popped it into my CD player, I've been absolutely obsessed with it.  Much of the music is, well... haunting.  Personally, my favorites are \\"This Picture\\", \\"Sleeping With Ghosts,\\" and \\"Second Sight\\".  Brian Molko's voice is absolutely unique in its lilting vibratto, and the lyrics are not only plaintive, but heart breaking.
B00009V7RF|5.0|I really like ELEPHUNK. I bought the CD yesterday, and I love it. Wish I had gotten it earlier. I've be loving they're performances on TV. The music is more interesting than most of the other hip-hop albums. <br />ELEPHUNK should have been nominated for album of the year. The Grammys really missed this one. Hope they win for Record of the Year (Where is the love)and Best Rap/Sung Collaboration (Where is the Love). Once I had a chance to really listen to the words, I realized how good the song actually was.<br />I would definitely recommend this CD.
B00005JLWN|5.0|I went to the official site for this movie and was STOKED to see it in theatres. Funny though, how it never actually made it there. It seems that too many people compared it to the Matrix for the studio to see it as a profitable vehicle. If you accept that the Brothers Waichowski and Kurt Wimmer drew from the same influences in realizing their seperate visions it's EASY to see that the films are otherwise nothing alike.<br />The people who say it is are the same tunnel visioned close minded lemmings who say all rap music sounds the same and once you heard one country song you've heard them all.<br />This is a great, action packed movie. It may be thin on story, but the story IS present. What it happens to lack in story it makes up for that in punch.
1565123875|5.0|A journalist from the Times in London remarks that this is the best debut novel he has read since Arundhati Roy's 'The God of Small Things'. Indeed, this is a remarkable first novel by a 26 year author. Writing from the heart and no doubt using her experiences growing up in Nigeria, Adichie has produced a book that makes you intimately share every experience of Kambili, the narrator. You are enraged at the abuse she suffers from her father, a zealot who loves his children in his own twisted way while disowning his father for not converting to Catholicism. You feel the pangs of a first, forbidden love with her. You share her very existence as a girl who is perceived to be so rich and fortunate- but who cannot even linger to talk to friends at school or watch television or listen to pop music.<br />This is a beautiful novel. The characters are complex and thought-provoking. I could not figure out the father character, how he seems to genuinely love his wife and kids and even suffer along as he inflicts terrible pain and torture on them. In contrast are his sister, Aunty Ifeoma, and her lively kids who may want for material things but whose spirits soar. In the background is the turmoil of Nigeria- the corruption, the politics, the shortage of fuel, the power cuts, the unrest. <br />When I reached the end of the book, I found myself hoping for a sequel. What happens next to Kambili, Jaja and Aunty Ifeoma's family? Someone said that you know a book is good when you reach the end and feel you have lost a friend. I felt a bit like that on the last page. Highly recommended.
B000002I4W|5.0|The first time i heard this album, i was so amazed i made a point of not listening to anything else for about three weeks, while i wrapped my head around it... it really changed my understanding of music. Buy it!
0634049011|5.0|This is one of the best books I've ever read for guitar.  I have always had trouble finding my way around the fretbaord, but after working with this book I have no trouble at all.  There are so many helpful tips and exercises that you can't help but become ultra fluent on guitar.  And unlike most books, the material in this book is presented in a manner that is easy to understand.  It's all connected perfectly, instead of YOU having to piece things together.  I would recomend this book to anyone.
B0000VCZKM|1.0|If you are any type of movie collector, don't waste your time with this pointless FULL SCREEN version. This is a wonderful, wonderful film that deserves to be treated as such. Why a studio would waste time and effort by releasing crap is beyond me. I am usually a vigilant shopper when it comes to DVD, with a collection well over 400, but I made the mistake of purchasing this edition and now I am stuck returning it.
B000058983|5.0|Of all the cases of local cultural favorites &#34;not ready for the big time&#34;, Love is one of the most instructive.  Arthur Lee and co. owned 60s LA, but unless those going to San Francisco were &#34;in the know&#34; they might have missed out on a group even further from incense and peppermints than the fabled Velvet Underground.  Unlike their peers the Byrds and Buffalo Springfield, there was nothing of the country in Love's music: it is probably fair to say this is even the sound of lifetime Angelenos rather than suburbanites.  But unlike their successors the Doors Love's music was refined and pointed even at its most raucous: and this, their final record and mature statement, is decidedly not their most raucous but borrows every fillip from the MOR playbook for a fantastically confusing record -- chock full of AM hits that weren't, for reasons still obvious today.  To say that Arthur Lee stands apart is to understate the case on account of his race: the integrated Love was as far from worldly concerns as possible, and those oriented towards VH1-style accounts of nightmare spirals of booze and pills may find the hints of Lee's later trouble on this record rather unsatisfying.<br /><br />It's as though Arthur Lee knew that he was to get in trouble that wouldn't mean too much, so decided to write lyrics full both of nonchalant unconcern for others *and* painstaking attention to the detail of his world -- &#34;The Red Telephone&#34; is every bit as documentary in character as &#34;Between Clark and Hillsdale&#34;.  Is this a didactic work of art?  I should say no, because although these prophecies of liberation at times surpass those of the feel-good-flower-power set (never all of the late 60s, and perhaps even not most) to work this kind of artistic magic one must take an undue amount of responsibility upon oneself: this is a record of private pains, and it takes a while to learn that.  But that Love is so well remembered by generations of musicians and fans elsewhere says something about the intrinsic involvement of &#34;elective affinities&#34; in art appreciation: that is to say extrinsic parallels between different groups of listeners indicating &#34;phenomenological&#34; similarities in their reception of said artworks, or at least that nobody was invited to say such things as the pieces can stand alone.  Really perfect for considering the tension between culture and morality.ys something about the intrinsic involvement of &#34;elective affinities&#34; in art appreciation: that is to say extrinsic parallels between different groups of listeners indicating &#34;phenomenological&#34; similarities in their reception of said artworks, or at least that nobody was invited to say such things as the pieces can stand alone.

B0000DD7LC|5.0|Ok, let me start off by saying that I am not at all an Alicia Keys fan. In fact, I thought that she was highly overrated when she first came out. Perhaps it was because she was being marketed as this really deep person, like a Lauryn Hill or something. I have also never been too impressed by her vocal skills at all. Let's just say that they are kinda average to me, and I'll just leave it at that. Anyway, when I heard &quot;You don't know my name&quot; I suddenly became hyped about the new project. I thought I would just buy it and if I didn't like it, oh well- I got it on sale. However, when I put it in, I found an album of infectious beats that are hard for me to get out of my head. I think that Alicia definitely embodies the spirit of the musical era she is going for. I have a great admiration and respect for her instrumental skills. I also think that her voice, though not phenominal, really fits the type of music that she is marketing. Since she doesn't have a pop voice or pop music, it's fine that she's not the best singer in the world. I have not stopped listening to this album since I got it. <br />My favorites are Heartburn (come on-that beat is just really tight! you just feel it in your gut), Diary (Absolutely beautiful, to say the least), When you really love someone (It just sounds like a really old school cut), You don't know my name (old school-ish classic), and If I ain't got you (very soulful). <br />I think that whether you are an Alicia fan or not, you deserve to have this in your collecion. If you don't like her voice, I guarantee you will absolutely fall in love with the musical arrangements. I think I'll actually give the first album a chance now that I have heard what she really has to offer.
B000092Q4U|4.0|(4.5)STARS<BR>   These guys really impressed me on this album. The vocals in my opinion are very good ranging from low to high pitched growls periodically. The drums are pretty good and the riffing is very innovative. I like the way these guys sound. I think the melodies in the songs are relatively innovative. It seems as if this band fits into the real metal scene, kind of like how the second chimaira cd has gone past nu-metal and into the real metal category, i dont think this is a nu-metal album, they deserve alot more credit for their accomplishment of a very good album. I believe these guys are going to get very big over the years, i have high expectations for them. Good job guys.
B00008GKEG|5.0|For about the last 15 years I have been a huge Beatles fan. During this time I have been so wrapped up in their music that I never really bothered to learn anything about the history of the band. <br />I bought this for my girlfriend for Christmas because the Beatles are her favorite band and thought it would be fun to watch together. I was right.<br />This anthology has managed to give me a much deeper appreciation of the band that changed rock music as we know it. Hearing the stories behind some of my favorite songs gives me a whole new outlook on the music.<br />As for my girlfriend, it has definitely renewed her interest in the band she loves so much.<br />This is highly recommended for anybody that likes the Beatles in any way. To the casual fan, this will definitely make you a much bigger fan. And to the complete Beatle-maniac, it totally confirms why you love them as much as you do.
B000005ILF|4.0|After 2003's 'Sacred Love' by Sting, I changed my mind about 'Mercury Falling': it's not any more Sting's worst album. Im fact, it's just a different kind of Sting! He has us so spoiled and used to his musical creativity sparkling in the most brilliant and unexpected ways, that this album comes as a bit of a surprise: it is off to the side in the midst of the rest of Sting's work, with an odd combination of horns filling in spaces that would normally be taken by more \\"Sting-like\\" instruments, such as a classic guitar, pipes or piano solos, and some country riffs that even the most die-hard Sting fans have a hard time digesting.<br />Escaping this recurrent trend in the album are the opening \\"Hounds of Winter\\" (the most \\"classic Sting\\" song in the album, if there's such a thing); \\"Hung my head\\", a song with better lyrics than arrangement, brought back to life by the late Johnny Cash in his posthumous 'American IV' album; \\"Alone with myself\\", a track with an odd-time signature and a beautifully written song; the Brazillian-influenced and French-sung \\"La Belle Dame Sans Regret\\"; and \\"Valparaiso\\", named after a Chilean port town, and accompanied by pipes in an eclectic mix like Sting got us used to in his memorable 'Soul Cages' album.<br />Poor? No. Bad? Far from it. Just slightly off to the side of the rest of his work, and now, thanks to 'Sacred Love' from 2003, not any more his least desireable album! I give it four stars without much else to say about it.
B00004Z459|5.0|The cd is purely amazing, and definitely a great way to start off their career. The content has a good mix between slow and fast; soft and strong beats and lyrics. The cd is just under 40 minutes, and you will not overplay songs b/c of the length, which is something I think is extremely great about the music. The band worked hard to pull of this cd and all their time and effort shows in the music they produced. Their fan involvement is better than any other band, and after other releases they've had, only good things are in store for them in the future.
0451191153|5.0|This book was helpful in giving insight into how people should live life. It signifies the creations of mankind and how we can learn from their actions.  I really enjoyed the ideologies of Roark. I loved how he practiced architecture not for the money and fame, but for passion.  He was a creator that practiced originality.  He believed that every building has its own purpose for its certain surroundings.  In a way this can be correlated to us humans.  We ourselves have to stay original to ourselves.  It will do us no good to immitate the actions of others as it will only lead us to self destruction. It is these correlations that give this novel praise.
014028009X|2.0|I enjoyed this fictitious diary about Bridget, a thirtysomething stressing about men, diets, and men...did I mention that? However, since I'm not British, and a bit young for the series, it was not that easy to relate to Bridget, even though I did like her. I also knew I missed quite a few jokes with all the British slang. It has it's cute moments, but overall, it's just basically a fluffy light read, nothing more.
B00005JMGC|2.0|As a Julia Roberts fan, I was looking forward to this movie, particularly after seeing her discuss it on television. She seemed genuinely moved. After watching the movie, I kept trying to figure out why! This movie does very little to enlighten or inspire anyone, relying upon old cliches and dialogue and the relative skills of the principles - even they disappoint. Make no mistake, Julia's ability as the present-day actor is seen at times, but it unfortunately is drug through so much \\"muck\\" in the plot as to be completely disregarded. I wanted truth in this movie, and only received the tired old drivel.
0743455967|4.0|Incase anyone hasn't noticed this book is based on and around Stephen's life and how he acheived his status in the literary world.  He states that it is very hard even for good writers to acheive any success.  So when you say it is a waste of time, you are telling people that they should only base their writing on this book.  This should not be the case.  Many other books will help each individual and their writing style, including this one.  This book is a guide to how you could write and to help bring your imagination forward.  It is a teaching memoir, this is the way he writes.  His use of experience prepares the reader for what may happen not what will happen. <BR>I definately recommend this book, novel, teaching guide whatever you may call it.  I know for sure that it can help people maybe not you but it never hurts to see other points of view.
B00005ATQF|5.0|Another intense film from Stanley Kubrick.  The best part of the movie is the bathroom scene, in the beginning of the film.  The rest of the film is good, even though it was over after the bathroom scene for me!
068484267X|5.0|McCourt writes so well, I wish it weren't a memoir.  I would read anything he put out there.  Really good stuff.  And the history of Ireland,  it really put a picture in an impoverished region I had no idea of.

B00008CQS0|4.0|You can enjoy the music more if you have seen the film and can connect the melodies with the scenes.  In fact there are a few melodies and there are several varations of each in the disk.  The piano pieces are great and when accompanied with the archestra, they are even better.  Soft and relaxing.
0060536357|5.0|This book became the basis for a paper I wrote in school and by the time I finished the book and the paper, I was actually surprised by my conclusions. <br />Leveraged Buy Outs (LBO) and Management Buy Outs (MBO) were all the rage in the eighties, and this book chronicles what is good about them as well as what is bad. In the general public's opinion, the bad far outweighs the good, but from a maangement standpoint, they can be a good idea.<br />The leveraged buyout of the RJR Nabisco Corporation for $25 billion, recounted in this book, is a landmark in American business history.  Ross Johnson, CEO of RJR Nabisco, is is just one of the colorful cast of characters involved in the midst of this book, as he sets in motion whagt would become the basis for the events chronicled in &quot;Barbarians.&quot; <br />Should be required reading for all business students and busienss leaders.
B000002BYD|5.0|yes I remember buying Ten and thinking, \\"what a CD\\", but by getting all the other ones you can see how they have evolved to much much more than just 'radio hit songs.' Once Vitalogy came out, and some people said marking them leaving 'grunge' music you were waiting for an album like this. It starts off with a hard, fast paced song-'Brain of J.'-which gets you in the mood for a compile of heavy hits, but you don't get that, bad?... Not at the least. You will dive into some of Pearl Jam's best work. Faithfull sets the tone and does a damn good job of doing it. Not as fast paced or hard as some of Pearl Jam's other songs that were number 2 on the line-up up to this album but still gets harder towards the middle then back.-the previous songs at number 2 were-Even Flow, Animal, Spin the Black Circle, and Hail Hail.-this may not sound important as to where they are but it does make a difference. And it doesn't drag you out of the mood you're in. Now this may come off so far as being a real slow album, but it's not. I'm just pointing out that Pearl Jam has many different levels. 'No Way' is a song that needs to be heard nore than once for some people to get the full effect. 'Given to Fly' is a wonderful song that takes you to a place where you've thought about before, but was never given the oppritunity to go there. 'Wishlist' is a miraculous song with one line I'd like to point out- I wish I was as  fortunate, as fortunate as me.- Showing that Ed Vedder, unlike many artists today, isn't in it for the money, or anything like that, but for the love of music and the love he gets by bringing his music to your life. Just listen to the lyrics to this song and all of Vedders' wishes- there not for a big house or 100,000 dollar car, or anything materilaistic (even though i know he could get all of that anyway) but it is for things like \\"being a messanger, where all the news was good\\" and a \\"radio song, the one you can't turn off\\" or the \\"star that goes on the Christmas Tree.\\" allof these things are not only for him, but you see, they bring others happiness and joy. <BR> I could go on and on about the songs and what I believe they symbolize and whatnot, but go out and buy this album and find out for yourself. This is my favorite Pearl Jam album, but every Pearl Jam album is great. I hope when you listen to this album it will do for you what it has done for me.

B0000TB01Y|5.0|As I read the reviews of this musical, I am stunned by the number of people who are rating this score as mediocre.  I am a Media and Performing Arts MFA candidate, and I have a great deal of background in musical theatre both in the aspects of performance and study, and I have fallen completely in love with Wicked.  I have not had a chance to see the musical yet, but one of the most satisfying characteristics of the CD alone is the richness of the story.  The way good and evil are explored as a kind of continuum, and the depth of the relationship between Glinda and Elphaba is completely riveting from a purely aural perspective.<br />Secondly, the music is outstanding.  Stephen Schwartz has captured the emotional journey of these two women in such a way where even the intervals that each character sings enhance the character development of these two distinctly opposite but innately similar women.  Chenoweth and Menzel are a dream team as they belt out such duets as &quot;Defying Gravity&quot; and &quot;For Good&quot;.  I was blasted into &quot;songasm&quot; as Menzel belts through her new found flying capabilities.  Finally, a musical has been written where two strong women sing power duets!!  I have been listening to Wicked for a week straight.  Thanks Mr. Schwartz for creating a sound spectacle for the live theatre!

B000000OAN|5.0|I am not a Queen fan or a big rock and roll fan for that matter.<br />But, this is one of those few gems...\\"Love of My Life\\" is SO overlooked as a ballad for the ages. If it wasn't for the  garbage that's been Top 40 for the past 10 or so years (exceptions - \\"Groove is in the Heart\\", \\"Waterfalls\\" and some of Will Downing's ballads), this ballad would be a huge smash even today.<br />The entire collection is classic...rating up there with \\"The Yes Album\\", \\"Ben Webster Plays Ballads\\" and Will Downing's \\"Moods\\" as perfect mood pieces.<br />Just buy it...dig the harmonies in the middle of \\"Prophet\\"...and the ditties are cool, too.
0060005688|5.0|This is an eye-opening book -- it brings the clarity and insight into decision-making that The Tipping Point did for trends.<br />I have seen Barry Schwartz interviewed on TV and listened to a radio interview regarding this book.  These interviews focused a lot on decision-making in things like shopping, and how having more choices actually makes shopping harder and makes everyone dislike the process more.<br />I think \\"Paradox of Choice\\" does bring insight into shopping, but its range is actually much wider than that.  Schwartz discusses people making difficult decisions about jobs, families, where to live, whether to have children, how to spend recreational time, choosing colleges, etc.  He talks about why making these decisions today is much harder than it was 30 years ago, and he offers many practical suggestions for how to address decision-making so that it creates less stress and more happiness.  He even discusses how so much additional choice affects children, and how parents can help make childhood (particularly young childhood) less stressful.<br />There are two other factors about this book that really made it great for me.  The first is that Schwartz is a serious academic (although his writing isn't dense in any way at all) -- so he talks about studies that back up his assertions in every facet of his argument.  He describes the studies in a very lively way, so that they really come to life, and we can understand how they relate to the issue at hand.  And, importantly, we then realize that his discussion is really founded on the latest and most advanced research into decision-making.  This is not some self-help guru with a half-baked idea spouting off.<br />The other thing that I really like about this book is that it has given me a new way to think about our larger society, and what I like and don't like about it.  Schwartz has written books before that are expressly critiques of some aspects of America today, and while this book is more focused on the individual, you can't help but come away feeling more thoughtful about the larger effect of these issues on our culture.<br />I only wish that I had read this book before my latest career change -- it would have saved me a considerable amount of anguish.  This is a great book!!
B000002UB3|5.0|All contemporary music can pretty much trace its origins to the Beatles and I am amazed at how important and fresh this album still sounds in 2004.  Yes thats 35 years after the event.  Thats the reason I`m writing this review, in order to let young people know just how important the Beatles are and that any musical journey needs to start with them.  Oh and the reason I chose Abbey Road is because its just one of the greatest albums of all times.  Especially considering that the band was pretty much falling apart at this time, but when the tape starts rolling they became the consumate professionals and just lived the music.  You can argue the merits of Sgt Peppers, Rubber Soul, Revolver, Magical Mystery Tour as being better, different or anything and you`d get no argument from me, they are all classics, this is just a personal favourite.  <br />\\"Come Together\\" is track one and starts the album brilliantly with McCartney contributing the greatest Bass lick on what is a Lennon tune.  Harrison shows his finely crafted songwriting skills on \\"Something\\" his ode to his wife, Two slightly ridiculous songs \\"Maxwell`s Silver Hammer\\" (which is kinda black humour)& \\"Octopus` Garden\\" (sung by Ringo)pop up on side 1 which lighten the mood between some of the heavier moments.  One of the heavier moments is I Want You (She`s so Heavy)proof that the Beatles could have become one of the great Blues Bands if they had felt the urge.<br />Then of course there`s side two with the Harrison`s \\"Here Comes the Sun\\" which was further evidence (Something) that the Beatles had developed a third \\"great\\" songwriter.  The arrangement by McCartney, the Medley, a Tour de Force Mean Mr Mustard, Polythene Pam, culminating in the Brilliant \\"Carry that Weight/The End\\".  Some of Pop`s best moments.  Then the afterthought \\"Her Majesty\\" almost White Albumish in its foolishness but a song only the Beatles could get away with.  <br />All in all a marvellous album which was their last album together but 2ndto last released.  Buy this album it should appear in most people`s top 20 if they`ve got any sort of historical perspective.
6301963695|5.0|If you've gotten this far in the reviews, you'll notice that either people love this film or hate it. It's pretty much right down the middle, which in a way, is a reflection of American societal attitude towards it's own sexuality.<br />If your own sexual world isn't aware there's something other than the missionary position, chances are you'll see this as a vulgar, disgusting film. The world that John draws Elizabeth into is a very psychologically complicated and sophisticated one. If you can't identify with lifestyles like that, you can't understand how or why they exist.<br />Personally, I found this film a masterpiece, not so much from the story line, but the mechanics of it. The cinematography is nothing short of breathtaking. Subject matter debates aside, this is a beautifully photographed film. Camera angles, lens choices, it's obvious the director worked very closely with the cinematographer in capturing on film exactly the image he had in his head. I can't say enough about the beauty of this film.<br />I thought both of the principals turned in exceptional performances, even though I view Rourke as a below-average actor. This film is easily his best, which actually could be said of Basinger as well. The Casting Dept. did a good job on this one.<br />Bar none, Basinger's strip tease (done with very little nudity) goes on my \\"All-Time Best Scenes List\\". The music choice, Joe Cocker's \\"You Can Leave Your Hat On\\" was a stroke of genius!<br />Alas, years after it's debut it's the subject matter that is remembered, and I find it still holds up. I'd suggest this film highly. Careful though, you may get more than you bargain for if you make it a \\"first date\\" flick to watch!
6304675348|3.0|I don't know whether it was because I had heard so much good stuff about this or what, but it turned out rather disappointing. The film is very well acted, shot and often scary. However I thought the plot just went downhill after the opening sequence. The ending didn't satisfy me and in my opinion, it was a tad humorous but I felt it had a demented and crude side to it. The ghost-face villain was sometimes creepy, but had no atmospheric movements like other killers in other similar films did. I thought the film was pretty good, especially the opening sequence with Drew Barrymore, but the film went downhill quite a bit. I just think it got a little too many they-like-it-so-i-will-like-it reviews which made me a little disappointed. Otherwise, pretty good.

0679428895|2.0|Most good-to-great novels take some time to get absorbed in. (Think \\"Moby Dick\\", \\"Crime and Punishment\\", or even \\"Lonesome Dove\\".) But not \\"Pompeii\\" by Robert Harris. Here you are immediately swept up in the excitement and suspense provoked by the appointment of a new \\"aquarius\\" overseeing the Aqua Augusta, the massive aqueduct supplying Pompeii and surrounding cities with fresh water. The resentment of his new charges, the mystery of what has happened to his predecessor, the reader's awareness of the impending volcanic disaster - all this contributes to a compelling beginning within the first few pages.<br />The momentum established in the first chapter of \\"Pompeii\\" is carried through - until somewhere near the halfway point of the novel. At about that point my interest started to flag. It began to be clear that the breakneck pace of the story had momentarily obscured the formulaic structure, the lack of any real subtlety in drawing the characters, and the thinness of the insights into the structure of 1st century Roman culture. I began to breathe a sigh of relief each time the author paused all-too-briefly for an exposition of the engineering details of aqueduct construction.<br />Far shorter than any of the more famous novels mentioned above, \\"Pompeii\\" in the end proved a pleasant enough diversion. But the author missed the opportunity to turn his story-telling skills and immersion in the details of ancient water management techniques to greater advantage.
B00006RU5B|5.0|Audioslave's debut album proves that great rock music is still alive. I don't understand how one reviewer said that this album is &quot;Excellent, but disappointing&quot; -- those 2 words just don't go together -- and also the complaints that this album sounds like &quot;yet another grunge retread&quot; and that &quot;it doesn't live up to expectations&quot; -- Give me a break! This CD not only lives up to my expectations, but far exceeds them. I had already heard the first two singles &quot;Show Me How To Live&quot; and &quot;Like a Stone&quot;, and loved them, but thought that the rest of the album would probably sound like any other repetitive rock album. After hearing the great 3rd single &quot;I Am the Highway&quot;, i finally bought the album. And I was completely wrong about any negative assumptions i had made! There really isn't one bad song on the entire CD. Each and every track has great vocals from Chris Cornell and superb guitar work and instrument sounds supplied by the rest of the band. But I think the album should have ended with &quot;Getaway Car&quot; because it would have been the perfect ending to a phenomenal CD. That song is mellow yet extremely passionate, i love it! I cannot wait to hear Audioslave's next album because i can only invision them getting better and better. If you don't already own this album, go buy it NOW!
0312962118|4.0|Snow Wolf tells the story of 4 people who, in 1953, are part of a plan to assissinate Soviet Leader Joseph Stalin.  The set up of the story is somewhat slow with Jake Massey's son investigating the truth of how his dad died in Moscow in 1953.  He meets up with Anna Khorev who tells him the entire story in incredible detail.<br />The first half of Snow Wolf describes Alex Slanski and Anna Khorev's training in Massachusets while Massey and Henry Libel make plans once the spies are in Russia.  A lot of scenes in the novel seem out of place, but eventually all of the characters have a place.  Still, the novel doesn't pick up steam until the characters are in Russia.  Once their, KGB officer Yuri Lukin is put in charge of a massive manhunt for the US Spies.<br />There are several twists and turns and several close calls, and Meade resolves everything a bit too neatly.  This is still a great historical thriller and I recommend it to anyone.
B0000DZ3IG|5.0|I work in a stressful job and this cd helped both energize and soothe me as I worked throughout the day. Usually once I play through a cd once, I will switch it with another or turn on the radio. I was surprised by this soundtracks freshness and variety and ended up keeping the cd in the whole day! Now that's a testament to a cd with just a great mix of music that can be played time and again.
0385504209|2.0|This book was obviously written with the film rights in mind. it starts out with a somewhat interesting premise, but rapidly becomes completely unbelievable. The detectives and prime suspect all do things that strain my ability to suspend disbelief beyond the breaking point. The history and explanation of the hidden codes were interesting, but could probably be explained better in a straightforward and scholarly book better. The story started out unbelivable and got worse from there.
B000089RV6|5.0|this a good album but with all the extra stuff-and remastered- its a must have. not a bad song on it either..always a plus!!!!!!
0060977493|5.0|There is nothing I can say that hasn't already be said.  So what I will do is tell you why this book is worth the time.  The negative reviewers complain that the book is difficult to understand and often has childish phrasing.  What these people failed to understand is that most of the sentences are supposed to be written from a child's perspective.  The prose is so poetic, that had there been no plot at all, the book is still worth the read because her use of language is so impressive that no one book I've read since has even come close to par.  It's ruined me for most other books.  Few people will understand every part of the story the first time through, but there are over a dozen intricate underlying themes you can uncover (but you don't have to uncover them to enjoy the book).  The only reason I managed to understand it my first time through was that my close friend took a class that revolved around this book and he was able to explain all the difficult passages to me.  I'm not one for reading and I am telling you that there is nothing wrong with this book.  No one, but no one writes like she does.
B0000DD7LC|5.0|Miss Keys is sure to become a legend in her own time. It is so rare in this completely saturated cesspool of vapid pop songs that an amazing and truly magnificent talent like Miss Keys emerges unscathed by the current trends. She is a gifted songstress, lyricist, and musician with an undeniable power to evoke the strongest passions. Her voice soars with gorgeous grace through each song, making the album a beautiful compilation of soul stirring. Miss Keys has done right by the greats of R&amp;B like Marvin, Aretha, Stevie and Donnie. Like each one of these profound soul stirrers, Alicia has a raw combination of desire and pain that accents every  song. She's just got that magic, that ability to make you groove to each hypnotic melody. Songs like &quot;Heart Burn&quot; &quot;You Don't Know My Name&quot; &quot;Karma&quot; and &quot;Diary&quot; are evident of her capacity to channel the ancient spirits of soul. The entire album may not be perfect but there's even beauty in that. It deserves five stars for Miss Keys efforts alone. She has created an album with such passionate chemistry that it reminds us of a time when people actual sang about the joys and pains of love and actually meant it.
B000002J1U|5.0|Strangely, this album is one of the more overlooked in the Led Zeppelin catalog. I don't know why, though; this is certainly one of Zeppelin's most consistent albums. I find it to be much more continuous, musical, and flowing than the first two LPs, although achievements like &quot;The Lemon Song&quot; and &quot;Dazed and Confused&quot; are hard to top. Here, though, is where Zeppelin matured and showed their range.<BR>1 Immigrant Song - This is the most famous song from this album, and a very good rocker. It's really fun, but it doesn't have the insane solos that Page would go off with in concert. Live takes of this song are usually better than the studio take.<BR>2 Friends - An oddly experimental, quasi-acoustic song. Jones's synthesizer drone at the end is to cover up a production mistake of Page's during the sessions (he had accidentally erased the original drum and bass intro of Celebration Day). Plant's vocal here is very good.<BR>3 Celebration Day - Screwy slide guitar powers this heavy one. Another really fun, energetic song. I like Bonham's drumming a lot.<BR>4 Since I've Been Loving You - A wildly overcooked blues epic, Since I've Been Loving You has a lot of great playing and singing, but ultimately feels far too contrived to be actually bluesy. Bonham's bass drum pedal also squeaks throughout the intro. I think this was a lot better in concert as well.<BR>5 Out On The Tiles - Astonishingly, one of Zeppelin's most underrated rock-outs. Anything this complex, funny, and ballsy should be enshrined as a lesson to rock hard musically.<BR>6 Gallows Pole - One of Zeppelin's acoustic standards (I'm not exactly sure of that, tell me if I'm wrong). Page's mandolin work here is beautiful. I love this track.<BR>7 Tangerine - Not there lyrically, but otherwise all right. Plant should have muscled up Page's lyrics, because Page is an inferior lyricist to Plant.<BR>8 That's The Way - One of Zeppelin's very best, possibly my favorite acoustic Zeppelin song. Perfect in almost every regard.<BR>9 Bron-Y-Aur Stomp - This track is so hilarious and original. It's an acoustic, dancey stomp-type number...about Plant's dog. In spite of that, it isn't filler at all. Simply charming.<BR>10 Hats Off To (Roy) Harper - This is actually Bukka White's &quot;Shake Em On Down&quot;. Dedicated to English folk-blues singer Roy Harper, Page freaks out on bottleneck acoustic on the left side. On the right side, Plant's howling vocal (ran through a vibrato amp, probably a Leslie cabinet or a Fender Vibrotone, and heavily filtered as to resemble a shellac 78 record) invokes the old Delta blues gods. Ahh, very, very fun indeed, and a quirky way to close.<br />There you have it. Get this album now!
B00005JMCN|4.0|Seabiscuit (Gary Ross, 2003)<br />Judging by the polarized reviews given to me by people I trust, people I don't trust, and friends who know far more about how horses should look than I do, I expected to either love this movie or hate it. What I didn't expect was the middle-of-the-road reaction I ended up with.<br />I always seem to forget Jeff Bridges as an actor, despite his fabulous performances in movies as diverse as Starman, Jagged Edge, and Tucker. He can take just about anything and make himself into it. And he does this quite well with Seabiscuit owner Charles Howard, self-made millionaire and general blowhard. Chris Cooper is excellent (if a bit too loquacious) as trainer Tom Smith, and Tobey Maguire does a capable job of playing Red Pollard, finally proving he can act. And when the three of them get together with Fighting Furrari (who was the \\"main\\" actor among the many horses who played Seabiscuit), the movie is magic.<br />I don't know conformation from constipation. If you put Seabiscuit (often described as short, ugly, deformed, etc.) next to Man o' War (often described as one of the perfect specimens of the breed), I'd probably not be able to tell them apart without nametags. So I can't react to many of the details I've heard are incorrect about various parts of the movie. Others have done so far more capably than I. I'm also not going to make exhaustive comparisons with the book, since I read it roughly three hundred books ago and don't remember many details, though all three of the human characters mentioned above seemed to be different than they were portrayed in the book. The one criticism I do have with the last hour and a half of the movie is that, let's face it, two jockeys traveling forty miles an hour on the backs of two racehorses are not going to be able to have long rambling conversations. Try it with a friend of yours out the windows of two cars going the same speed, and see if you can hear your pal as well as Tobey Maguire hears Gary Stevens, and vice versa. Ain't happening.<br />So in other words, the last ninety minutes were great. Inspiring. Amazing. Beautifully shot. Everyone went above and beyond the call. (Slap a coat of paint on Fairplex and uproot some hedges and you could make it look like Pimlico, but they actually went out and shot at Pimlico.) The ending was a little over the top and emotionally manipulative, would have had the same power without the voice-over, but that's to be expected from American movies. Can't really fault the filmmakers for that.<br />The first hour, on the other hand, would have benefited from an editor with a slightly firmer hand; say, the Torso killer. What took sixty long minutes to convey could have easily been done in twenty. And those twenty could have been a mite clearer. (I knew who Tom Smith was supposed to be, because Chris Cooper looks like a heavier Tom Smith. I've heard others say they had no idea until well into the movie.) I understand what they were trying to do, and it was something I despaired of when I first found out the movie was going to be made. The book centers on Seabiscuit, but paints the larger picture of why he so captured the national imagination. That's something that, if you're going to do it in a movie, should be integrated with the plot, in the details. Look at, for example, Bladerunner. You learn everything you need to learn about the world in which the characters live without needing an hour of setup at the beginning; it's all in the details and doesn't interfere with the plot. The same could easily have been done here, but the screenwriters took the easy way out and have us an hour of setup before we got to the action.<br />Still, it was a good film. All the performances, especially that of Jeff Bridges, were well-done, the direction was capable, and the racing scenes were very nicely scripted given the impossibility of directing horses. Very much worth a rental. *** ½evens, and vice versa. Ain't happening.<br />So in other words, the last ninety minutes were great. Inspiring. Amazing. Beautifully shot.

B00005K9LN|4.0|This is a great great great album! No frilly stuff, no messing around - just straight-forward metal from The Priest! I love \\"Living After Midnight\\", \\"Grinder\\", and \\"Breaking the Law\\"! Who says gay guys are wusses? Rob Halford (the lead singer) is gay, and this album kicks ass! All the songs have this sort of steady, grinding beat that feels so primitive and so good!
B00000D9TK|5.0|A WONDERFUL INTERPRETATION OF JEAN-JACQUES GOLDMAN'S SONGS BY CELINE DION, WHO ALTHOUGH SINGS BEAUTIFUL IN ENGLISH, SINGS ABSOLUTELY MAGNIFICENT IN FRENCH. I LIKE ALL THE SONGS BUT MY FAVORITES ARE: ZORA SOURIT, ON NE CHANGE PAS, EN ATTENDANT SES PAS, L'ABANDON, &amp; TOUS LES BLUES SONT ECRITS POUR TOI. LISTENING TO CELINE IN FRENCH IS PURE JOY!
B0000CFW87|5.0|I have no words to express what this cd made me feel. This cd is just incredible and definitely better that the first one. Even though most of the songs are in foreign languages you get to love them simply because is Josh who is singing them. He has an extraordinary voice that can turn any song into a magnificent experience. I love &quot;Oceano&quot;, &quot;When you say you love me&quot; and &quot;Hymne a l'Amour&quot;. However, the best song is &quot;Remember when it rained&quot;, first because you get to listen to him playing the piano and because he wrote it, and second because you get to hear his voice at his maximum. You won't regret it. I can guarantee you that all the songs will put a smile on your face. This cd has the power of making you feel happy.<BR>BUY IT.
B0000844IT|5.0|This movie by itself was and is one of the most hilarious films I've ever viewed.  But then when you put Director's Cut and the U.S. Theatrical Version together in the same package, you have pure madness!  If you like horror/comedies this is the package for you, if you can't afford this 2 disc set, at least buy the movie by itself.  But if you're a dedicated Evil Dead fan, buy this!
B0000VAFO0|5.0|This movie has great action, acting, killer stunts, special effects, and a kick ass soundtrack. Kate Beckinsale is magnificant! This is her finest acting yet. This is one of my favorite movies of the year. Better than Matrix. A must buy for anyone.
B000006045|5.0|Before you read this review, forgive my english, mostly grammar<br />Like almost everyone else, I started listening electronic music by chance, on the back of a taxi, late night ('by chance'?). Anyway, I think one have to listen much trip hop before giving an opinion. It is not after many years that I can dedicate an entirely evening just laying back having a cup of coffee, listening the great Mezzanine.<br />After their past records I can ensure Mezzanine has whatever it takes to be considered a leyend. Here the emerging electronic sound of the 90's combines greatly with dark beats, funky synth's, pianos, keyboards, male and female whispering voices to create undescriptible moods and feelings inside you. <br />Try it, have a drink, relax, and play. Let &quot;Angel&quot; introduce  you into the new sound, trip hop sound, with fine tuned guitars; follow up with a journey through &quot;Risingson&quot; where 3D makes clear how low and mysterious his voice can get; then liz frasier will ensure refreshness into your mind with a moody scratchy sound in &quot;Teardrop&quot;; to begin again with dark and rough beats accompanied with del Naja whispers on &quot;Inertia Creeps&quot;; &quot;Exchange&quot; stands tall only remembering a bit of old sounds (Protection maybe); sara sings like no one can, angelical voices with the tinging pianos, a catchy bass and later rough guitars, &quot;Dissolved girl&quot;; no much for &quot;Man next door&quot; (no like Andy's sound on this) except for great drums; then comes the greatest track (own opinion), on &quot;Black Milk&quot; we can find all that makes trip hop, trip hop, the starting pianos set the mood for the bass and later perfect down, low and sentimental beats, the voice , as always, cant get any better, all this with now and then background scratches and samplers and to conclude with a 'dj solo', &quot;Mezzanine&quot; and &quot;Group Four&quot; reafirms Massive Attack sound, great beats, trance sounds on the back, and perfect voices by 3d, Mushroom and liz.<br />Definitively, if you like MUSIC, you must have Massive Attack's Mezzanine.<br />Hope you can find the review helpfull.
B0000TB01Y|4.0|After having the pleasure of seeing this wonderful show on Broadway, I purchased the soundtrack and find it a fine momento of the experience.  While there is no way the CD can capture the audience enthusiasm that bouys this show and the amazing talents performing this score, the recording does a fine job.  Out of context, the score may seem mundane but seeing the production will convince the most hardened sceptics that the music fits and that \\"Wicked\\" works from first note to last.  The highlight, \\"Defying Gravity\\" is unrivaled, but the rest of the songs are good as well.  If you haven't seen the show or if you have, you won't regret buying this disc if you enjoy Broadway musicals!
B00004SYWZ|4.0|I loved thier first two albums, and then fell off after 'Stay on These Roads' for awhile. Memorial Beach came my way in he nineties and I like it, though not as much as Hunting High and Low.  It was a good album, but the feeling evoked from hearing Morten's lush vocal arrangements in &quot;Living a boy's adventure tale,&quot; and &quot;The Blue Sky,&quot; seemed to be missing. Song's like &quot;Cold as Stone,&quot; and &quot;Lamb to the slaughter&quot; stood out as well as &quot;Locusts,&quot; but as good as they were, they did not hit me the same way.<br />Then I listened to this album, with songs such as &quot;Thought that it was you,&quot; &quot;I wish I cared,&quot; and &quot;The Sun Never Shone that Day,&quot; and realized how much an instrument Morten's voice is. It's a paintbrush, and the more layers he adds, the more colorfull the songs become. He complements Paul, and Magne.<br />A very nice album.  I would compare it to the first two, definately.
B00005ASHM|4.0|If I talk about the music of this wonderful masterpiece, it is in my opinion the best pop recording ever made. The melodies just have this feeling that immerses you in that incredible world of harmonies that only Brian Wilson is capable to do. Songs like `Don't talk (Put you head on my shoulder)' can turn your eyes into tears; you can enjoy the amazing arrangements of the classic song `Sloop John B'. Finally `God only knows', any words I write about this song will get short, the vocals from the late Carl Wilson just makes you realize how deep he can be perform the beatifully composed melodies that Brian arrange in this song. I think it's one of the best vocal performances ever made.<BR>Regarding the 5.1 mix, when you listen, it is clearly that the center channel it's not there, only ocassionally. In my opinion, leaving the center channel without sound can empty and in this case it does not support the overall sound of the songs in `Pet Sounds', that could be distributed thru 5.1 channels without any problems. In other words you get only 4.1 mix that it's not at the quality level of the songs and the rest of the mixes (mono and stereo);which sound great by the way.
1400034779|4.0|The first thing that you might notice about this book (indeed, the whole series is the language. The no. 1 Ladies Detective Agency is written in this precise, methodical, but wonderfully melodic and wholly satisfying tone, that immediately reminded me of so many real people in former British colonies dedicated to using and mastering Queen's English. It only adds to the character of the novel as a whole. By the end of the first chapter I was even thinking in shorter, more precise sentences.<br />The second wonderful aspect of this novel is its heroine, Mma. Precious Ramotswe. She has somehow managed in Gabarone, Botswana to cultivate the common sense of Miss Marple, the good manners of Hercule Poirot and the savvy and discretion of Hetty Wainthrop.<br />Then there are the sort of cases that come her way and the people she encounters, but to get into detail might ruin it for someone else. My advice is to buy or borrow the bookand settle down with a nice hot cup of bush tea (this really heightened the experience for me - it's known as Rooibos or Ruibos in North America!).
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I watched the series when it began and I just bought the series on DVD and have to wonder who the supposed geniuses at FOX are to have canceled this show. Fourteen episodes in all, some of which were aired out of order and some of which were not even aired at all. The justifaction of not even giving a series a chance to find its fan base is a common trait among these TV executives, FOX in particular. Remember, this is the very network that canceled Harsh Realm after only three episodes. It's a wonder any show has a chance on that network and it's amazing how often a show, that isn't a horrendous pop-culture sitcom or some sickingly redundant reality show, gets the boot. A word of advice to genuine creators of good shows. There are much more open minded networks who appreciate something new and who would no doubt give a new and different show a fighting chance. If you want to see first hand what I mean, watch Firefly. Such rich characters that could have become something great as well as a show that would have taken the viewer on a superb journey. I should know having watched Joss' other shows. He has a natural born talent for making you feel for the characters. You watch Firefly and you're there. You are a crew member of Serenity. Joss, you are a great talent among peers who don't get it. Here's to hoping that your next series is given a fair and fighting chance.
0156027321|4.0|Life of Pi is an interesting and enjoyable book. About a boy stranded with a tiger at sea, it does have slow points - particularly in the area of dialogue (as would be expected). However the pacing makes up for the necessary reductions in speed to give an overall fulfilling ride. I give it a solid recommendation with The Secret Life of Bees, Bel Canto, and The Three Junes.
0375432302|1.0|It constantly insulted my intelligence with its constant stupidity. How can anyone possibly take a book that cites the dead sea scrolls and Disney movies as theological proof that The Holy Grail is not a grail, but a woman, seriously? I mean, Disney wasn't even alive when The Little Mermaid was made, and I really doubt that he dedicated his life to spreading the message that Christ had a blood line and was married to the holy female. ??!!<br />When I realized it was about the Holy Grail I suddenly saw connections with Indiana Jones and The Last Crusade. Obviously Dan Brown isn't clever enough to come up with his own Holy Grail quest without ripping off Hollywood cliches.<br />If you want to understand the Quest for the Holy Grail and its impact, watch Monty Python and the Holy Grail for complete historical context.
B000089RVX|2.0|Evanescence falls into the new trend of template groups, built and maintained entirely by the labels to make the music industry engine run smoothly. There isn't much originality coming from this CD, it is plain, flavorless without any surprises. On the other hand, if you do not like creativity, originality and aren't the kind of person who likes to experiement with its musical tastes, this album is for you.<br />A few notes of encouragement, this is only Evanescence first release. There is a lot of groups from which we never ever heard of their first release and that we have long forgotten. I believe this album will be rapidly forgotten and if the group has any creativity potential, it will rapidly turn towards progressive music and improve from their arragements & sound which currently turns more towards popular & alternative music. It's not like if they didn't have any technical merits such as many other template groups out there. They only need to focus more on creativity rather than focusing on selling albums.<br />Some titles deserve more attention, such as \\"My Immortal\\" which highlights the beautiful voice of lead singer Amy Lee. Unfortunately Evanescence is the perfect example that good lead vocals do not make an entire group as the rest of the album sounds ( musically speaking ) rather uniform. Even with the electronics, distortion and drums, if the arrangements sound popular the rest of the album will sound popular and this is case right here.
0385504209|4.0|I was reluctant to read this book since it seems like everyone else did and was raving. In the past I have been disappointed by books that were getting big attention. An example is \\"The Lovely Bones\\".  Anyway, \\"The DaVinci Code\\" lived up to all the great things I heard about it. Fast moving and it makes you think.
B0000DZEA1|5.0|To quote Theoden King ( I think!)  <br />I bought the soundtrack weeks before the movie.  I KNEW the final chapter was going to be a masterpiece by listening to this soundtrack!  Howard Shore has created such a work of art here -- it's not just a movie soundtrack.<br />This score moved me from beginning to end.  To end with the lovely and haunting of Annie Lennox was genius! There is not one wrong moment in this score! The voices of Billy Boyd and Viggo Mortensen only bring you closer to those characters!  James Galway and Renee Fleming -- Bravo!  I can not say how much I admire the work in this score.  Everytime I listen to the soundtrack there is something else I discover.<br />When I finally did see the movie Peter Jackson said that this was the most emotional of the three chapters.  This score not only accompanies the action and emotion it puts you IN the emotion.  I was moved to no end!  <br />Bravo Mr. Shore!
B000002UAI|5.0|Great early Beatles songs from the Cavern Club days.  This is the Beatles as they sounded before Rubber Soul and the over production of the mid-60s albums.<br />No Reply, Kansas City...great songs. 5 stars.
0671015206|3.0|Unlike one reviewer who gave this book a lower rating, because he didn't agree with the apparent single-mindedness of the millionaire subjects themselves toward accumulation of wealth, my problem with it was the very narrow financial orientation that the authors took in their studies. Most of the principles followed by the millionaires to accumulate their wealth are pretty much common sense (at least for me, an AAW, though I could see they wouldn't be for an UAW - you have to read the book to figure out those acronyms). Though there are a few profile or sociological nuggets of surprise here and there in their tables and evaluations, for the most part the book just continues to repeat a few stale themes over and over. <br />What's really missing, in my opinion, are insights into these people on a more personal level. What do they do with their spare time besides count their money and plan their next investment? What are their political views, their peak experiences, their great interests in life besides wealth accumulation? Of course, we could speculate on all those and probably not be far wrong, but the point of the book was that our biases and pre-judgements about who are millionaires are mostly wrong in the first place! The way these people come across in the book are as uncultured, uncharitable (\\"My favorite charity is me.\\"), unimaginative, coupon-clipping, miserly dullards. Not anyone you would want to meet! Does not a single one of them ever splurge on the least bit of indulgence (maybe a bottle of cheap champagne at New Year's) or have a passionate hobby (toy trains)? There is no human side to these folks' personalities presented, which leaves the book dry and lifeless.<br />Besides that, it really doesn't contain much practical advice for those who are not accumulating wealth already as to how to turn things around (\\"Hire an accountant\\"). And many of their statistics are wrenched into awkward positions to support their conclusions. Simple-minded formulas suchas, \\"your net worth should be equal to your age times your annual income divided by ten\\" are great for bumper stickers, but if you really think about that it is a next to useless measure at any point in time.<br />So, don't spend much for this book, it ain't worth it except as an entertaining quick read (fortunately the repetition makes that easy). Good luck!
0800177177|4.0|I only gave this film 4 stars, because after you see it so many times you notice alot of things that could have been corrected had the spent a little more time on it. Over all, this film is amazing. I would recommend it above any other Dracula movie out there. It's based on the original Dracula story written by Bram Stoker. They changed the plot quite a bit, but for the better.<BR>The cast alone could have made this movie great even if the plot lacked.  With names like Gary Oldman, Anthony Hopkins, and Winona Ryder how can this movie fail?  Gary Oldman is astonishing.  If Dracula looked and acted as Gary Oldman did who could refuse him?  Anthony Hopkins is the only person I could ever see playing Van Helsing.  He fit the character perfectly.  Eccentric, a bit psychotic, wise, and charming, who better to play that role?  Winona Ryder did a good job playing Mina, but I wouldn't say it was the perfect role for her.  The only complaint I could have about the cast is Keanu Reeves.  What were they thinking with that?  No matter how hard he tries he will never shake the surfer persona he took at the beginning of his career.  They could have found many more that would have suited the role of Harker much better.  Besides that, he did a bad job with the english accent.  It sounded fake and not well rehersed. <BR>The film was well adapted to the book, despite the fact that it completely changed the plot.  They turned it from a story of sheer malice and revenge to an epic love story.  Dracula's wife threw herself into the river after receiving false news of his death. This is true in accounts of history, but isn't directly mentioned in the book(if memory serves me right), but it's a strong point in the movie.  In the movie, Dracula searches for centuries to find his lost wife. Finally that comes when Harker comes to Transylvania to finish the transaction between Dracula and the firm Harker represents. He finds that Mina, Haker's finace, is reincarnate of his beloved Elizebeta who flung herself into the river. From then Dracula's plot to win his love back begins.  The entirety of the movie is based on the struggle of choosing between the power of eternal love or the bonds of religion and the decisions between right and wrong. The movie brings Dracula from this horrible, murdering monster which he's always portrayed to a man with a heart struggling between life and love. He risks everything to be with his one true love.  Heart warming, right? As the cover says, love never dies.<BR>Francis Ford Coppola does an amazing job with the imagery of this film.  The special effects are amazing for the time.  And the costumes are utterly astounding. The images in this movie are hardly forgetable.  <BR>On top of all that the sound track is amazing. During the ending credits they play a song by Annie Lennox. 'Love song for a vampire' is such an amazing song. After seeing the ending of the movie it will make you at least come close to tears.<BR>Again, I would higly recommend this movie to anyone who likes the story of Dracula.  Even to those who like love stories, just as long as you don't mind a bit of gore.
B00005JKC3|3.0|I went into the Hulk hoping to see stuff I loved in the comics like the Hulk leaping high in the air, getting larger as he got madder, slamming his huge fists against the ground to make things fly in the air. I wanted characters like Betty and Thunderbolt Ross and wanted the Hulk to rip tanks a part and bend their cannons, or grab the cannon and swing it around and around. This was the sort of stuff that comics were made of, but which were left out of the live version on the small screen and I really wanted to see these things on the big screen. After a more drama oriented first half which seemed like a little too much drama, things took a turn and surprisingly I got all the things I wanted to see brought to life! Hulk even said &quot;Puny Human&quot;! Classic! I could complain that Rick Jones didn't make it into the movie, but the movie had BRUCE Banner, Glenn Talbot, Betty, Thunderbolt, and Hulk was Hulk so I'm happy. It may not be an incredible Hulk movie, but it's not bad and I'm up for a sequel. Maybe Rick will make it into that one.
B0000VCZKM|1.0|I was very much looking forward to adding this to my collection, since I remember my parents taking me when I was a child and loving it.  I thought for sure this special edition would be a great addition to my collection.<br />WRONG!<br />It's not in widescreen!  Does the late (and great) John Huston, who shot this film in 2.35:1, deserve to have the special edition of his film chopped up to Pan &amp; Scan?  For those who say you only lose a little off the sides, consider this:  for 2.35:1 films like &quot;Annie&quot;, you lose about 40% of the original picture.  40% in my opinion is much more than a &quot;little bit.&quot;  Imagine having 40% of your family portrait chopped off!<br />If you really love this movie (and many do, including me), you should let Columbia know that you want (and deserve) an anamorphic widescreen presentation (which means enhanced for widescreen TVs) in its original aspect ratio (OAR) of 2.35:1.
B00005JL78|3.0|Sci-Fi thrillers are always good to watch. Speilberg gives us a real treat and this is certainly one of Speilberg's darkest films to date. Minority Report has more in common with Schindler's List and Blade Runner than it does with Close Encounters of the Third Kind or Jurassic Park. This is new ground for Spielberg and having bombed with A.I. it is certainly a better direction for him to move in.<br />Tom Cruise is at the helm of this futuristic crime busting lab that is able to predict serious felonies before they happen by way of three psychics that are hooked into the system. His display of manipulating their imagination and dreams among a big glass digital screen is almost done with the same wizardry that Speilberg edits his own films. Speilberg's thoughts are on form in Minority Report and most of the movie is big and wild in a vast dreamscape. Speilberg does not leave it at that though. He manages to actually hunk in a tense action thriller full of suspense about a man on the run from his own system. It is also full of brains and creative imagery. Who can forget Cruise chasing his own eyes as they roll down the hall? \\"What!\\" you say? Yes, Speilberg has gone a bit loco here and it pays off in aces.<br />Who can also forget the performance of Colin Farrell who actually manages to convincingly try to outperform Cruise on the screen, even though this is one of his first mainstream films. This flick is as much Farrell's as it Cruise's and boy does he make sure of that.<br />I will not spoil the plot but it has something to do with Cruise predicting his own felony which involves a homicide of man who may have kidnapped and murdered his son. Speilberg cues lots of actions, sci-fi extraordinaires, genuine detective work and throws in a who dunnit' to cap it all off. Make no mistake about it. Minority Report is a fast fury of unstoppable set pieces to boot.<br />Unfortunately Speilberg does not deliver on the last fifth of the film. Here he goes for double-jeopardy when maybe he should have just stayed put. The extra fifteen minutes tries to turn the chase on the bad guys instead and unfortunately never lives up to what the first 2 hours of magic gave us. In fact it is cheesy and out of kilter with the rest of the film. It feels a bit contrived and certainly is devoid of the suspense that we witnessed throughout this great sci-fi fest. What does it end up doing? You come away feeling that you should have left fifteen minutes ago. It was such a shame to have been on the edge of your seat for most of it only now to be sitting there gawking at your watch and wondering if you are looking at a reel from another movie that projectionist tagged on by accident.<br />When all is said and done the movie is inescapable enchantment but is marred by a terrible ending whatever way you look at it and it does lower the quality of this fine film considerably.n maybe he should have just stayed put.

B000002UA9|5.0|Early Beatles.  The best sound they ever had.  Much better than the studio overlayed orchestra and string dominated songs that dominated Rubber Soul, Revolver, Sgt. Pepper and Magical Mystery Tour. <br />Buy this - as well as With the Beatles, A Hard Day's Night and Help.
B00003CXPD|5.0|When my friend recommended we see this film, I really didn't remember hearing about it.  When I saw the cover, I realized I had passed by it in the video store a million times without interest.  It seemed like the story of some little innocent kid having a good time...perhaps he would meet a fairy or a magical mushroom or something.<br />Boy was I wrong on that one.  This movie is truly one of the best I had seen in 2003...and I saw it at least twice and got different things out of it each time.  The basic storyline is about an 11-year-old boy in a miner's family who discovers that he prefers to join the girls for ballet class rather than go to his boxing class.<br />When his father finds out that he's been spending money &amp; time to learn ballet, he completely flips out.  (A little predictable, yes.)  But, the storyline is complex enough that you are able to sympathize with the father's point of view.  He &amp; his older son are part of the HUGE miner's strike in the early 1980's in the Northern England the helped change the industry forever.  This strike - and the resulting poverty of many in their town - is a draining &amp; disabling blow for a tough man who has lost his wife, is trying to keep his older son in line, and has to cut up or sell every last thing he cherishes in order to keep his family alive.<br />It is against this backdrop that one young boy discovers that he loves dance.  Emotionally, you don't know where to turn.  On one hand, you are delighted that this boy is able to find some sort of outlet for his pent-up anger, joy, sadness, fear &amp; hope.  On the other, you realize that this is not an ideal time or place for such a discovery...and the father has enough on his plate without needing to have a Disney-esque type transformation required of him.<br />As the story progresses, it is perhaps a little predictable.  (Except when Billy beats up the little rich boy.  That was unexpected and fairly amusing.)  However, I think the genius of the filmlies not in the uniqueness of the plotline but rather in the human story told via this plotline.  The acting is absolutely suberb as you are drawn into this tale of strikers battling policemen, the intense loyalty of the miners to each other, children beginning to grow up, a tough little boy finding an array of hope, and the unexpected support a bunch of burned-out characters can give to each other when their hope is renewed.<br />I want to make a special mention of Billy's ballet teacher because I think she is one of my favorite movie characters.  While Billy's father &amp; brother &amp; best friend, etc. are all great characters, I really loved this woman.  She was as tough as nails and as burned out as a middle-class wife &amp; mother could be in such a tough period...and yet you respect her for how she holds herself, for how she hangs on, and for her selfless interest in at least one little boy.  I don't think she's an easy character to summarize &amp; dismiss.<br />BTW - a special note to viewers.  This movie employs cursing as a way of expressing some of the emotion of the day.  I don't think it's forced at all, and the British accent &amp; terms don't make it as offensive to our ears.  However, I wouldn't recommend you watch this if it will be a problem.
B000001Y5D|5.0|4 Non Blondes &quot;Bigger, Better Faster, More...&quot; was one of my favorite albums when I was 13.  I remember buying it around the same time I bought Nirvana &quot;Nevermind&quot; and Smashing Pumpkins &quot;Siamese Dream&quot;.  I played these three albums so much the tapes broke (I listened to audio casettes NOT cd's back then).  I remeber pushing play on this album for the first time and hearing the opening song &quot;Train&quot; slowly fade into my head phones.  I felt like I was a hobo hitching a ride on a freight car. The whole albums is awesome. Blues &amp; Rock should always be this cool. Linda Perry also has the craziest, most power female singing voice ever.
B00005JLXE|3.0|Daredevil is a good comic book movie with some great moments. Affleck is better than I thought he'd be, Garner is beautiful, Duncan is great as Kingpin and Colin is fun. Some say David Keith's character was totally wrong, but that's how his character is in other versions of the story. Check out the Spiderman Vs Daredevil DVD. How DD goes blind is the same in that version as in the movie so they drew from existing DD lore. <BR>The fight between Elektra and Bullseye was right out of the comic! Unlike some, I don't think waiting ten years before Bullseye and Elektra's big scene would have been too practical and don't mind that they gave it to us up front. I can't wait for the Elektra movie! I also thought that scenes like the return of DD's strength in the church was the type of superhero stuff that has a place in a superhero movie, and liked the way DD heard Ben's car with his super hearing and used it. It didn't contradict DD's scene with the Kingpin at all. <BR>The movie paints with a broad brush Murdock having fun with his powers more than he should if he want's to keep his secret identity, but DD's secret identity has been revealed in the comic and he always shared his identity with too many people anyway. The playground scene was so much like the one with DD and Echo in the comics and I thought it was so over the top it was fun. Stan Lee often made things over the top.<BR>Ben Urich, Bullseye, and the Kingpin may not look identical to the characters in the comics, but that's often the case when comic books are turned into movies. I wish the DD costume had been a tiny bit closer to the comic book type, but it wasn't bad. According to the DVD DD almost ended up wearing a sweat shirt with a hood and some of the other costumes tried are awful! The director makes it clear he wanted the comic styled costume and even put in a reason for DD to button the top button of his movie costume towards the end of the film so he could look even closer to the way he does in the comic and I thought that was clever. <BR>There's room for improvement, but Daredevil is a good superhero movie. I'll be in line for DD2 and look forward to an Elektra movie. Amazon also has Spiderman Vs Daredevil and DD's best comic adventures too.
B0000CAQ27|1.0|Well, for Pink with me it's like that: I can't believe her. First she's that Dallas Austin R&amp;B chick where you really thought people told her: die your hair Pink and call yourself Pink.

It's like she's a walking marketing trick. A bit like Miss Aguilera.
B00005JKMQ|2.0|If you have a choice between the documentary - \\"When We Were Kings\\" and \\"Ali\\" pick up \\"When We Where Kings\\" and then watch \\"Ali\\" after for Will Smith's performance alone who was up against Denzel Washington for an Oscar in 2001. Sometimes Will Smith even looks better than the real Ali in \\"When We Where Kings\\"!<br />Maybe if Ali had been a better movie Smith would have zipped past Denzel but unfortunately the movie is sadly very undernourished on the story front and feels very dull for a man of such stature. This is coming from a director too who is just well under par in this opus. Everything is here! - The fights, the family, the troubles, the controversy, the sets, the era and the players, but what it is missing is the element of hope, achievement, despair, loss, anger, happiness, punishment and every other emotional wallop that you would expect from a character with a biography to die for. The actors all carry and show these emotions but this film does not for some strange reason. It feels that the acting is too distant, far away, not-tangible and ultimate impossible to relate anything much too. You can not seem to find anything about yourself or your roots to bring to the film. There is also thus extremely very little that you can take away with you from it. It makes for a film that has everything on form, strike that! - Oscar winning form - but never seems to want to be entertainment or an art form or much of a motion picture film.<br />It is very hard to put your finger on what makes this film unmemorable. It certainly does not lack substance or drama but it just resides in a detachment of its own narrative which at times may be a bit too convoluted even though the film has nearly a three hour running time. The audience's disengagement can probably be found in Mann's misdirection of the moments in time that jump years but because the character in the last scene is in the next scene it leaves you feeling quite frankly - confused. In fact this type of mystification does reign throughout the movie. You are unsure if Ali is five years older or ten years older. You do not know what has happened to him in-between and the next scene could be five years ahead yet again or the next hour for all you know. Mann never does fix things down for us and so Ali's story remains scattered across the screen.<br />See for it Will Smith though. He does an excellent rendition of the greatest boxer of all time. You can barely recognize him on the screen. He is pumped up to Arnie-like sizes.tion does reign throughout the movie. You are unsure if Ali is five years older or ten years older.

B0000AQS0F|5.0|As an Australian, I am disappointed that firefly never made it to our airwaves. If it had lasted a full series in America, maybe it would have...?<br />As a result, Firefly will not be released on region 4 (as far as I know) - thank God I have a multi-region player!! Someone I met on the net (also an Australian, strangely) recommended this show to me and I fell in love with it straight away.<br />I'm not a fan of Buffy etc, and if I'd know that the same mind was behind Firefly I may not have watched it. I'm glad I didn't know that, and I never regretted getting Firefly the DVD
B00003CWTI|3.0|Well, I suppose seeing that I'm writing an on-line review, I am publicly judging, but this was one of my all-time favorite lines in this movie.  Though I have very mixed feelings about the movie as a whole, this line of Tom Cruise's during his interview was really a turning point in the movie for me.  <br />But, I supposed I should back up.  I originally rented this film because it is one of my co-worker's all-time favorite films.  She is definitely into the whole post-modern swing a little more than I am, but I thought I would give it a go.  Up through the first half of the movie, I wondered why I had bothered.  I found I was frustrated by the obscured shots of the actors (I had trouble recognizing the main characters) and annoyed by the unusual amount of swearing & hysteria.  Perhaps Moore's character was wacko & high-strung, but I couldn't figure why characters like Cruise's assistants were swearing so much either.  It seemed forced & unnecessary.  I was thinking that \\"Chocolat\\" did a better job in emotionally engaging you with it's post-modern ideals while \\"Adaptation\\" did a much better job of screwing with your mind.<br />At the moment when Cruise's character catches his interviewer in a big lie, I realized that some intelligence had surfaced in the film.  Up 'till then, his flamboyant character as a male motivational speaker was just over-the-top.  At that point, I finally became emotionally engaged in at least one character's plotline.  I somehow was able to glimpse a depth behind the schtick - he now looked vulnerable & actually sincere deep down rather than just an empty hothead.  However, Cruise pulled this off not by a move of weakness but rather by one of keen insight.  You begin to realize there's alot going on under the surface with this guy.<br />After that moment, I somewhat followed & enjoyed the various other emotional tones the movie was trying to bring out.  The cokehead's desire for honesty because she was sick of trying to please people was somewhat touching.  The cop's ability to stand up to rejection and to reach through the wall of the cokehead's defense was heartwarming.  The lack of glamour as the movie dealt with death, affairs, abusive parents, abandonment, and rejection was also a breath of fresh air.  The struggles were undesirable, all remained private and, for the most part, unresolved.  Much like our lives.  There is some hope that things might get better for some, but there are no sudden happy endings or vindications when the story becomes famous.  <br />A few other words for viewers...this plot may seem overdramatic, forced, poorly crafted, etc. to many.  However, I think it might have a particular power for those who have had hard lives...I mean really hard lives.  Kids who have been sexually molested & no one ever helped them.  Or children whose parents abandoned them.  Or kids who have had to take care of their parents while their parents died.  Almost all of the storylines tie back to such childhoods...and it makes the point that you may want to escape your past, but your past isn't done with you.  There are consequences for actions...and not only the offenders pay.  Oftentimes kids are the victims, and they carry these things with them into adulthood.  This may be a source of comfort for many carrying such baggage.<br />And, finally, I would warn most against this if you have a problem with swearing or nudity.  I usually don't mind swearing, but this one was over-the-top.  I kinda wished I waited for a \\"made for T.V. version\\" but I somewhat doubted one would be made.

B00003CXXP|1.0|The two best things about A.I is Jude Law's performance as an android and the robot carnival scene - everything else appears to have jumped out from a Disney film and certainly that is reiterated more than ever in the underwater scene. The underwater scene is a major turning point in this film because the major theme has been Science Fiction through and through but then quickly becomes little more than a (dis)enchanting fable. One could almost imagine Minority Report suddenly turning into Cinderella or Jack and the Beanstalk. A.I does just that.<br />A.I has one big problem. Speilberg has tried to make a film that works for all age groups but in the end this is a way too dark for kids in parts and a way too childish for adults to enjoy. Teenagers, in the middle, will be bored to death. So where does it stand? At times A.I is a pseudo-intellectual experience with big lashings of fantasy and reality that do not mix well. It has many metaphysical statements to make but these are marred by too many bleak moments that seem to nullify it all. The end sequence alone is almost testimony to A.I's meaningless. A.I goes nowhere ultimately.<br />A.I has Kubrick all over the first half of it. You can even see that Speilberg has retained his cinematic approach and design style. Just prop A.I up against the likes of A Clockwork Orange or The Shining and you will see it. However A.I certainly feels like an incomplete project and it is as if Speilberg does not understand how Kubrick wanted to finish it. I doubt if Kubrick knew either by the looks of things.<br />A.I is probably the broadest time-spanning film ever made. The concept of moving from modern day to distant future to an age of the Earth future is incredible. The protagonist in this story outlives everybody and everything, but finally the closing statement on that matter is simply void of anything nutritious except that he \\"got to see the future and some fancy looking aliens\\". The aliens even expound on their own meaning of life and it does not really seem that entirely scientific, but more imaginative if anything. It is actually a pretty unwelcoming finale to hear. It kind of feels like Speilberg has just taken a dump on you to top off his grim robot-boy yarn.<br />All in all and when everything is said and done this is just a picture that has some moments but these moments do not make a picture. The film LOOKS amazing and the cinematography/special effects are on flying form with dashings of livid imagination but the vast majority of it remains dull, plotless, pointless and somewhat painful. I certainly felt like I was ripped-off here a bit and for me A.I was a thoroughly massive disappointment considering the talent that was supposed to behind this Juggernaut that fans had been eager to see based on the hype for what... 20 years?

B00005JKWJ|4.0|An excellent film with just two minor drawbacks - 1) Ron Perlmam is in it, and 2) Ron Perlmam is in it. I realise that's the same reason twice, but I thought it was such an important one it was worth mentioning twice...  Honestly, the guy's so one-dimensional - he basically plays the exact same character in Blade II that he did in that awful Alien sequel he was in. Anyway, I digress...<br />The action in this film is pretty much non-stop, and gets going from the word go. And that's a good thing in my opinion. True, a couple of the CGI fight scenes are so obviously fake they're actually quite funny. Interesting cast memebers too - Danny John-Jules (Cat from Red Dwarf) plays Asad, and Luke Goss(!) plays Jared Nomak (Goss was in a pretty awful boy band with his twin brother in the late 1980's), but his performance here is quite good. Dont know why Whistler was brought back, as there was no real need to have him in this.<br />I have no real interest in vampire films/stories, nor have I read the Blade Comic books, but I enjoyed this nevertheless. The original Blade was also a blast, and this one doesn't disappoint. All in all, an enjoyable no-brainer action film.
B00008PW2D|2.0|My favorite show was a bit choppy this season. Although I totally enjoyed the episodes, I just can't pay the same price for this season as i did for the other seasons. Can't believe HBO didn't take this into consideration when they were pricing it. 8 half hour shows. That's it. Unless the price comes down, or the package deal is really attractive for all of the seasons, Season 5 will be missing from my collection. Sad, because I liked it.
B0000DD7LB|4.0|This album is ok if you don't mind music that has all been done before.  It has a few highlight which give the Britney Sound a new twist, not to mention that she doesn't work with Max Martin anymore, so thats one plus for Britney.  But even then so, she still has the sound that has already been done again and again by hundreds of other artists.  There really isn't nothing too much new here, and if you're looking for shock value, what is that even worth anymore?  Britney tries to hard to be shocking that shes not...  Don't get me wrong, I like the album, but Britney herself gets old quickly.  The highlights are &quot;Breathe On Me&quot;, &quot;Toxic&quot;, &quot;Touch Of My Hand&quot;, &quot;Shadow&quot;, &quot;Brave New Girl&quot;, and the beautiful heart-filled ballad closer &quot;Everytime&quot;, this is definitely a new side of Britney, but not a new side for music in general, so you decide whats best for you.

B00005JKED|5.0|Training Day works because it is pure fantasy masquerading as a reality. The film bends our suspension of disbelief at every moment. We all know that police corruption is a real thing but Lord if a character like Denzel ever walked the street of L.A like that for real he would be dead in a few months. The same goes for Hawke. Both these characters would have a life-span of a Star Trek extra who beams down to the strange planet with the rest of the party.<br />Denzel practically walks and drives the streets like he owns L.A. The man can go down any alley, go into any house, shot up any gang, beat up rapists, steal money, abuse criminals and have some extra debauchery on the side... all before cornflakes. Ethan Hawke is just a way out his depth as a rookie who gives new meaning that that word. A boy playing the donkey to such extremes that the carrot almost brings him to murder 'cause Denzel orders it.<br />What makes Training Day so good is that it blends so much reality with so much fantasy that the line blurs to the point where the two are no longer distinguishable. Then the director Antoine Fuqua can play with us all he likes by having the main protagonist abuse the rookie cop at every given opportunity. We buy it. We buy it all and ask for more. Fuqua then gives it to us by taking the whole police corruption element to new heights as a plot involving bent-cop-drug-dealers become the bait and main meal of the day. They even have totally outrageous names like - The Sandman, but still we think that what we are seeing is reality. Fuqua just has us wearing blinkers all the way as he directs us through the streets of crime with Denzel coming up with some of the most memorable lines in a cop drama ever.<br />The acting is all dark but good. This is a highly enjoyable romp, albeit a totally improbable one, but high-camp stories do not mean high-camp acting. This could well be the B-Movie of cop dramas, but it is just done so well. All the characters are radical and excessive. The plot is almost comic book quality. The ending is totally Hollywood in every department.<br />This is just a great fantasy cop movie that is worthy of repeat viewings. Fuqua is the master of the suspension of the disbelief here. It is very easy to fall victim to what you are seeing is real. Training Day is just salami, but what tasty salami it is.sive. The plot is almost comic book quality.

B0000UHFC6|5.0|This is a beautiful CD. I absolutly love... Ive listened to this CD all the way through, and would have to be the best CD out of the lord of the rings soundtracks. Howard Shore has done a fantasic job... Totally recommended it to all... Especially to the dedicated Lord of the Rings fans... OMG... Pippin's Song was sooo sad wasn't it... i totally cried...
B00005K9QP|5.0|Eric Clapton is the greatest guitarist that ever walked the planet Earth.  Of course, he'll never admit it because he's WAY too modest.  It really makes me mad when he says things like \\"I'm not the world's best guitarist\\".  Come on, Eric, that's a crock!  There may be faster and more \\"technical\\" players out there, but there is NOBODY more intense or passionate than Clapton.<br />Clapton left The Yardbirds in early '65, due to his belief that the band were drifting away from their blues roots.  Thus, John Mayall's Bluesbreakers provided Eric with another opportunity to show the world his awe-inspiring dexterity.  At just barely 21 years old, Clapton's playing on this album is simply devastating.  And the tone of his guitar was totally unprecedented at the time.  That shrill, distorted sound had never been heard before in the world of blues guitar playing.  He discovered that his Les Paul guitar, when plugged into a Marshall amplifier, created a unique, stunning sound.  And it was a huge influence on a certain fella named Jimi Hendrix, who soon went out and bought his own Marshall amp, following Clapton's example.  <BR>The rhythm section of John McVie (future Fleetwood Mac member) and Hughie Flint is solid all the way through.  As for Mayall, I think his singing is better than most people would have you believe.  He's an excellent harmonica player, too.<br />First of all, the sound quality on this remastered edition is absolutely FANTASTIC.  The music sounds crystal clear and fresh, so fresh that it practically sounds like it was recorded yesterday!  <BR>The album kicks off with \\"All Your Love\\".  A smokin' reworking of an Otis Rush tune, it has a driving riff, great beat and a vicious solo from Clapton.  After the second verse, Clapton ventures off into another riff.  After playing it a few times, he suddenly changes gears and turns the song into a blistering jam, with the rhythm section following close behind.  And the final two notes of his solo are so sharp and piercing that I can't even describe it in words.  It might just make all the hairs on your flesh stand on end.  All this excitement in just three minutes!  Then there's Eric's two jazz instrumentals, \\"Hideaway\\" and \\"Steppin' Out\\".  Both songs are just unbelievable.  \\"Hideaway\\" is quite stunning.  Eric sounds pretty simple in the beginning, but keeps getting more intense as it goes on, until finally he just explodes with a thunderstorm of blazing notes.  Wow!  And \\"Steppin' Out\\" will rock your socks off with that awesome riff!  One of the greatest riffs that I've ever heard.  And the soloing is once again ferocious too.<BR>\\"Little Girl\\" is a good song, but it's only real saving grace is Eric's solo.  \\"Another Man\\" is the weakest song on the album, and it sounds too much like 40's blues or something, which never excited me to begin with.  There isn't even any guitar on it, as it's just Mayall, his harmonica and some claps.  Not even a rhythm section!  Anyway, \\"Double Crossin' Time\\" might just be my favorite song on the album (it's so hard to pick one).  It's a positively shattering blues tune, and it features perhaps Eric's greatest solo on the whole album.  Just listen to his phrasing on this one.  Holy cow!  No wonder the fans would soon deem him \\"God\\".  Incidentally, this song is about Jack Bruce, who left The Bluesbreakers to join Manfred Mann.<BR>\\"Parchman Farm\\" is cool, I love the harmonica and the feel of it.  This is one blues song that Mayall did justice to, believe me.  The band's take on Ray Charles' \\"What'd I Say\\" also has a killer groove that's just impossible not to love.  There's also a decent drum solo from Hughie Flint, though it's nothing spectacular.  \\"The Key To Love\\" is pure jazz all the way, with some great horns and yet ANOTHER excellent groove.  Eric also delivers a blazing solo here.  And speaking of Eric's solos, the one on \\"Have You Heard\\" is considered by many to be one of his greatest ever.  And IT IS an astounding solo, indeed.  I don't think anybody else was playing the blues like that in 1966.  He plays extremely fast, yet extremely passionate at the same time.<BR>Eric also gets his first ever lead vocal here on \\"Ramblin' On My Mind\\", which is rather boring to me.  I never cared for his voice to begin with, and couldn't help thinking \\"When is he gonna shut up and play his guitar?!\\". <BR>And lastly, we have the marvelous harmonica-driven \\"It Ain't Right\\", which I absolutely love.  Eric keeps the riff going strong in the background as Mayall provides some cool vocals and screeching harmonica.  And I love the last few seconds of the song, where they change it around and turn it into a grooving rocker.  But it's over before you can really get into it!<br />It's nice to have the two bonus tracks.  \\"Lonely Years\\" is a drag, but \\"Bernard Jenkins\\" is a wonderful instrumental with some killer guitar and piano.<br />What an album.  No wonder it amazed guys like B.B. King, Mike Bloomfield and Hendrix.
B00005JMR5|5.0|I love this movie. It's my all time favourite and it's great to see it's out on DVD. Mikhail Barischnikow is of course the greatest dancer and performs his artistry. The storyline is breathtaking. All actors and actresses are simply supreme. It was Isabella Rosselini's first movie role . I saw this movie the first time in the cinema and it was the first time I saw Gregory Hines - who will truely be missed. He was a great actor and step dancer. This movie is one of the greatest but only a few people seem to know
B000059QY3|5.0|I loved it the first time I saw it.  She has a beautiful voice.  She IS Violetta.  The sound is very good in this DVD.  You can hardly hear any background noises.  Highly recommended.
B0000AMRJC|5.0|I usually like movies that focus on character development. Even though there is a lot of action and violence in this film, that action and violence is interesting because of the people involved.  You get to know and judge the characters because of how they act and what they say. <br />Oliver Stone wrote this screenplay and he did some field research on it, talking to people not only Miami but in South America where the drugs are made.  There is a gritty realism to the film so you get the feeling this really could have happened.  Of course, some of the facts may have been made up but generally speaking it seems historically accurate. <br />The movie draws the viewer in right away, the first 30 minutes might be the best.  It is so long that it drags a bit in the middle, but keeps moving enough to keep you interested.  Definitely you can see the ending coming a long way off, but it is still like an awful car crash you can't take your eyes off of. <br />I wouldn't put this on my top 10 all time list but it is pretty close.  I definitely wasn't disappointed.
B0000027RL|5.0|Ten is a true killer and with no doubt one of the top rock albums in music history. I would rate Nevermind as influential and groundbreaking as Ten, but I personally prefer Ten a lot more. Ten tops Nevermind in variety and power for about 80% of the songs, except Come as you are, which is brilliant. (Anyway, I can´t understand the bitching between Nirvana and PJ fans - this is ridiculous. Pay some respect to both bands, who had their unique impact on rock music).<br />I like the follower Vs nearly as much, but Ten is a slice wilder and more grass roots. Alas PJ lost some of their creativity and spirited power on the way and I don´t see any comparable masterpieces in their discography after Ten and Vs.<br />In my opinion there are only two albums in the 90s which could match with Ten: Angle Dust by Faith No More and The End of Silence by Rollins Band.
B0000DD7LB|1.0|After all the studio-work and probably plenty re-do Britney still sounds like she cannot sing. By now she has really turned into a sorry and embarrassing artist. She gets worse with each video. And why did Madonna take part ? Is her career already that much down too ?
B00012FXB8|4.0|Apparently like so many others, I was somewhat disappointed with the theatrical release of Alien3. But this Special Edition, which provides us with the much needed footage that was forcibly cut from the film, is both enlightening and entertaining. <br />Alien3 differs from its classic predecessors because it does not focus on the monster, but instead concentrates on the human journey. Like the prior two films, with the restored footage it is indeed a visual feast.<br />I don't want to spoil the details for you, and prior reviewers here have already done an excellent job, so I'll just conclude by saying that Director Fincher has been vindicated with the release of this Special Edition. Alien3 is one of those rare films that actually becomes more appreciated as time marches on.<br />Go ahead, and give this film a second chance by viewing this Special Edition - it's well worth your time and effort.
0385504209|1.0|This book represents such flagrant ignorance of the elements of suspense and mystery writing that it is deplorable.  The main characters are so capable of easing themselves out of predicaments that there is no tension whatsoever.  They could walk into the Oval Office and use a phone while discussing medieval symbology, apparently.  Throw a bar of soap out the window and all of the security forces in the district will chase it.  There are such an endless series of these episodes that it reads like a Monty Python plot.  The keystone evidently refers to the French and English cops.  Only Jim Carey could enact the exorbitant character expressions and reactions the author ties to revelations, events, and dialog. Forget the themes, a new meaning to the Holy Grail and the subjugation of feminism by the founders of Christianity.  It is so pedantic in its portrayal that it is, at best, marginal.  Maintaining the status quo through secret societies is portrayed as, apparently, appropriate, if shrouded by enough symbolic ritual and riddle to keep a mystic swimming.  References to real questions of religious reform, feminism, the priesthood, right to life versus abortion, and so on are ignored, so as not to offend any element of the book-buying public.  But there is a deep level of conspiracy and cover up evident herein!  How do Doubleday and the NY Times manage to cook the books and keep this appalling pulp number one on the best seller's list week after week?
B0000VCZKM|4.0|Growing up, Annie was one of my all-time favorite movies.  I sang all the songs, played runaway orphan with my friends, and watched the movie over and over on Betamax (for those of you born a bit later, that's like a VHS tape, only smaller).  <br />I was tempted to buy Annie as soon as it came out on DVD, but chose to wait for a version with some decent special features.  Lo, it is here, but there is one thing that I'm really surprised is missing.... where's the behind-the-scenes feature, \\"Lights, Camera, Annie!\\" which aired on TV back in 1982.  It included auditions for the role of Annie, dance rehearsals, cast/crew interviews, choerography and blocking of \\"It's a Hard Knock Life\\", a screen test of Aileen Quinn and Albert Finney and vocal rehearsals of \\"Easy Street\\" with Peters, Curry and Burnett.  That's the kind of thing that should be on a Special Edition DVD, so I'm surprised that since the footage exists (I still have my Beta tape, and surely it exists elsewhere), that they didn't use it.  <br />As much as I appreciate that there is a new version, it seems to be primarily catering to kids.  It would appear they neglected the adults who grew up with the movie and still think of it fondly, and would have appreciated more special features of the behind-the-scenes, as opposed to contemporary interpretations of songs and sing-alongs.   <br />Incidentally, why is this being presented as an \\"Anniversary Edition\\"?  Annie came out in 1982, so it's the...22nd Year Anniversary?    <br />I still love the movie, but just can't give this version a full 5 stars given my disappointment in the special features.
B00004RHZU|1.0|Well, for Pink with me it's like that: I can't believe her. First she's that Dallas Austin R&amp;B chick where you really thought people told her: die your hair Pink and call yourself Pink. Then she says: now I'm &quot;the real me&quot; and tries to be a Punk but looks like Brigitte Nielsen. She seems to bend simply to fill in the current clich. It's like she's a walking marketing trick. A bit like Miss Aguilera.
0375703764|2.0|I won't rehash what others have written in other reviews about the content of this book - if you wish to read a summary of the plot then go through some of the other reviwers' comments.  Yes, this book is clever, yes it it is large in its scope.  But to what end?  I kept waiting for a purpose to the whole Navidson Report (the fictional report that is discovered) to appear - and was disappointed.  Endless footnotes - but again - to what end?  Not really worth the effort it took to read.
1577311523|5.0|Over the past week or so I have read Eckhart Tolle's amazing book The Power of Now.  I am in awe of it's simplicity and power. To describe the essence of this book is to take away from it's very intention. It is not a book to be described, or really even rated. It is a book to be lived.  I am telling everyone I know to read this book. Get the book.  Read the book. Live the book. The book is.
B00003CXA6|5.0|First off, anyone gripping about the small budget effect of battle about this film needs to STOP and understand it WAS a small budget film.  This film was NEVER EVER intended for Theatrical release.  Only, the power of the film, demanded it be shown on big screen.  Michael Shaara's book \\"Killer Angels\\" on of the most moving look of the men that set the nightmare of Gettysburg into action, was given a new life with Ted Turner's group.  It was created to be run on TNT, his cable/satellite station in two parts.  So yes, the casting went with actors more in line with Telly than Theatre, yes, it had to cut corners on budget.  Does that affect the quality of the film?  No one bit.  Anyone grumping about the cannons not recoiling is nitpicking.<br />And for people fusing about 5000 Civil War re-enactors (including Ted Turner manning one of the non-recoiling cannons) being unpaid.  Well, ASK THEM.  The re-enactors thought this was a chance of a lifetime to record what they do annually anyway!<br />The movie was intended to address the personal side of the war, the friendships torn apart by deferences in belief, the frustration, the futility.<br />Richard Jordon's Emmy nominated performance alone is worth the price.  With fine work by numerous supporting actors such as Sam Elliot and Stephan Lang.<br />So one should not grip about what it is not - and was never intended to be - but appreciate the fine effort that is it.  One of the most moving looks at such a tragic period in history.
B000024ALA|4.0|The mood throughout the CD is held intact by shifts in lead guitar and occasional swashes of keyboards.  But by track 12 a monotony has completely unfolded and I was left with a gothic experience with very little variation.  The final track(#13)is easily the most interesting, sounding more like classical music than the doom-laden instrumentation of the earlier tracks. But I can't say I didn't like the album.  It was good, with enough interesting lead guitar changes to keep things relatively on course.  But get \\"Draconian Times\\" first...because I said so.  \\"Respect my aw-thor-a-tay!\\"
B0000D96NX|5.0|man what can i say this is the best album ever instant classic hella heavy,hella mellow,holy sh*t its good.no matter what anybody said about the burnning red and supercharger i always like them two records but this seems more true machine head. you get classic m.h. sounds some kinda, shadows fall kinda sounds,hatebreed kinda sounds, even pink floyd kinda sounds AND ROBB WAS THE PRODUCER SO IT HAD TO BE GOOD THANK YOU!
B0000VAFO0|5.0|I thought this movie was awesome, great special effects and if you love vampires and werewolfs then youll love this movie, with action packed battles of the two breeds.
B0000DZTIW|4.0|I find this to be a surprising Zimmer soundtrack. For a movie called \\"The Last Samurai\\" - and judging by the previews and posters that had been circulating - I had been expecting a cross of \\"Crimson Tide\\" and \\"Gladiator\\". Thoughtful, synthesizer-enforced music with occasional bouts of fanfare and bravado.<br />What I got instead was a beautiful, sensitive cross-section of \\"Braveheart\\" and \\"Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon\\".<br />This is a new direction for Zimmer. Oh sure, he has done more than swirling action and mellow synthesizers in his career, but his music always had a heavy presence. A certain reverberation. This sound is also present here - it is his hallmark after all - but has a Zimmer score ever been quite this melodious and acoustic? This sensitive and elaborate?<br />Zimmer's most heard critique must be that, even though he writes top-notch themes, he does not elaborate on them. That he fills his soundtracks with sounds instead of compositions. Now buy this record and be convinced of the contrary.<br />The emotional and atmospheric quality of \\"The Last Samurai\\" aside, this record proves Hans Zimmer is capable of improving his composing-style.<br />That is why this one gets four stars.<br />Bram Janssen<br />The Netherlands
B000002IWQ|2.0|Well, they asked for it.  Peter Collins and his glossy production trying to make Rush into something they are not.  Fear is not a good enough reason for prog-rockers to turn \\"Alternative.\\"  I swear some of the songs here sound like hyped versions of Pearl Jam.  I don't mind a change in direction, but an about-face is something else.  For such heralded musicians and writers of some of the more intricate songs I have ever heard, it was truly a shame to hear the fairly conventional song-structures, cliched lyrical content, and jagged production.  I remember actually liking this album for the first few spins, but after a few more I was beginning to be annoyed.  I never listen to this album anymore, while I still return to their earlier albums with confidence.  The only  really good track here is the instrumental \\"Leave That Thing Alone.\\"  That's good advice.  They have much better albums than this disappointment.  Later.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|What makes Firefly special is the writing, the cinematography, the actors, the emotion, the humor, the sheer scope of it.  This show is incredible, and I have trouble NOT talking about it!  How often does that happen with commercial television?  In a positive sense, I mean :-).  <br />Take a chance, spend the cash and get the dvd.  Everyone deserves to be truly entertained - the kind of entertainment which makes you think, the kind that expands horizons and heightens the heartbeat...but they're not borrowing MY dvd!!
0440237688|4.0|I really enjoyed this novel.  I love how Lowery creates a world where it seems as though everyone is satisfied, but it is obvious that there could be so much more.  It is beautfully written and fun and easy to read, but, at the same time, contains very deep and complicated themes.  Its a great book for a kid to read and a great book for an adult on another level.
B0000E6I1J|5.0|What a great concert performance this was. The CD &amp; DVD is the next best thing to being there. Rarely has so many great artists been put together to produce such a show. You can't go wrong with Paul McCartney, Ringo Starr, Eric Clapton, Tom Petty..and was also completely blown away by Joe Brown's performances.<br />There is only one quip i have with this, and i'm sure you already know what that is.  I do not understand why the label would leave off Sam Brown's &quot;Horse To Water.&quot;  Not only was that one of the highlights of the show, but it was one of the best performances i have ever seen or heard. <br />After all, this is a 2-CD set.  I don't understand why they couldn't fit just one more song on here.  Hopefully the record company will see the error of it's ways, and will re-release it someday with this song.<br />Definitely worth the $ for this compilation, though.
B000002IOW|5.0|I know many Rush fans who grew up listening to &quot;Moving Pictures&quot; and &quot;Permanent Waves&quot; and, let's not forget &quot;2112,&quot; who absolutely hated this album.  But when the arc of their careers are examined it is easy to understand why this album happened.  Peter Collins' production sheen was becoming stale with the release of &quot;Hold Your Fire.&quot;  The first shift in their careers came with &quot;2112,&quot; then &quot;Permanent Waves&quot; blew people away.  After that they rode the wave as far as it could take them.  They needed a new shift, a new producer.  Rupert Hine went on to produce this album as well as &quot;Roll the Bones.&quot;  With the new shift in direction comes vitality and an organic songcraft that sounds as fresh as anything they ever wrote.  I won't identify specific songs and/or why you should listen to them, because I think this whole album is great.  This is a splendid direction for them to take, with fine production and quite possibly the most heartfelt lyrics Neil Peart ever wrote.  This is New Rush, and worth an open-minded spin.
B00005JKZV|5.0|A great action and adventure movie, January 13, 2004<BR>This movie, a continuation of Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring, is a great adventure, action, love and companionship movie compacted into one tale. It tests the friendship and loyalty of the ring bearer Frodo Baggins and all who are out to help him on his quest to destroy evil. Each individual character has their own story and a task set out for them. I was a movie that kept me on the edge of my seat and my eyes wide open to know what was coming next. It is a perfect fantasy movie that will keep you entertained and wondering how one person could came up with all of these magical characters. I enjoyed both the first and second movie; I cannot wait for third one to come out on DVD.
B0000AQVCL|1.0|This album makes me want to die. Seriously, I've never heard more ambiguously derivative music in my life. The lyrics sound like a random sampling of every rock cliche in the book. The music sounds like a Stooges cover band made up of 13 year olds who just learned how to play. Britney Spears may as well be singing these songs, because Jet is just as phony, trite, and ridiculous.
0385504209|1.0|...<br />here is some of it<br />Brown is right about one thing (and not much more). In the course of Christian history, few events loom larger than the Council of Nicea in 325. When the newly converted Roman Emperor Constantine called bishops from around the world to present-day Turkey, the church had reached a theological crossroads.<br />Led by an Alexandrian theologian named Arius, one school of thought argued that Jesus had undoubtedly been a remarkable leader, but he was not God in flesh. Arius proved an expert logician and master of extracting biblical proof texts that seemingly illustrated differences between Jesus and God, such as John 14:28: \\"the Father is greater than I.\\" In essence, Arius argued that Jesus of Nazareth could not possibly share God the Father's unique divinity.<br />In The Da Vinci Code, Brown apparently adopts Arius as his representative for all pre-Nicene Christianity. Referring to the Council of Nicea, Brown claims that \\"until that moment in history, Jesus was viewed by His followers as a mortal prophet  a great and powerful man, but a man nonetheless.\\"<br />In reality, early Christians overwhelmingly worshipped Jesus Christ as their risen Savior and Lord. Before the church adopted comprehensive doctrinal creeds, early Christian leaders developed a set of instructional summaries of belief, termed the \\"Rule\\" or \\"Canon\\" of Faith, which affirmed this truth. To take one example, the canon of prominent second-century bishop Irenaeus took its cue from 1 Corinthians 8:6: \\"Yet for us there is but one God, the Father, from whom all things came and for whom we live; and there is but one Lord, Jesus Christ.\\"<br />The term used hereLord, Kyriosdeserves a bit more attention. Kyrios was used by the Greeks to denote divinity (though sometimes also, it is true, as a simple honorific). In the Greek translation of the Old Testament (the Septuagint, pre-dating Christ), this term became the preferred substitution for \\"Jahweh,\\" the holy name of God. The Romans also used it to denote the divinity of their emperor, and the first-century Jewish writer Josephus tells us that the Jews refused to use it of the emperor for precisely this reason: only God himself was kyrios.<br />The Christians took over this usage of kyrios and applied it to Jesus, from the earliest days of the church. They did so not only in Scripture itself (which Brown argues was doctored after Nicea), but in the earliest extra-canonical Christian book, the Didache, which scholars agree was written no later than the late 100s. In this book, the earliest Aramaic-speaking Christians refer to Jesus as Lord.<br />In addition, pre-Nicene Christians acknowledged Jesus's divinity by petitioning God the Father in Christ's name. Church leaders, including Justin Martyr, a second-century luminary and the first great church apologist, baptized in the name of the triune GodFather, Son, and Holy Spiritthereby acknowledging the equality of the one Lord's three distinct persons.<br />The Council of Nicea did not entirely end the controversy over Arius's teachings, nor did the gathering impose a foreign doctrine of Christ's divinity on the church. The participating bishops merely affirmed the historic and standard Christian beliefs, erecting a united front against future efforts to dilute Christ's gift of salvation.<br />go to the website to read the rest. ...

B000001ESJ|4.0|This is yet another of Rush's notoriously short albums.  The running time clocks in just over 37 minutes so, by fan standards, there is no room or filler.  However, like &quot;2112,&quot; there is a song here that is essentially a throw away track: &quot;Madrigal.&quot;  Not that it's bad, really, but when compared to the other tracks here it doesn't hold up well.  The favorite of Classic Rock radio here is &quot;Closer to the Heart,&quot; which they play nearly as much as any Led Zeppelin tune.  &quot;Cygnus X-1&quot; is justifiably epic with strange tempo changes and injected instrumentation.  &quot;A Farewell to Kings&quot; is a really good track, as is the underappreciated &quot;Cinderella Man.&quot;  But the masterpiece here is &quot;Xanadu.&quot;  Musicians love to play this song, particularly drummers, with its majestic dynamics and excellent interplay.  All in all, this is a strong album, slightly flawed here and there, but worth owning.
B0000UHFC6|5.0|I am a big fan of soundtracks, and I have now listened closely to all of the Lord of The Rings Cd's. The first one was very plain, and nothing extraordinary, the number two was the CD that, after my point of view, used the &quot;Lord of the rings theme&quot; best. I'm referring to the track The Uruk-Hai. Fantastic adventure music! But the CD that made my eyes wide open, was this, the number three, the last one, and the best one. This time Howard Shore has made a masterpiece! In the number three, Shore has changed out the main theme with something new. A even more heroic main theme than in the two others(!) It's just wonderful to listen to, and you get this good feeling when you hear it. My favorite in this CD is track number 3, Minas Tirith, where you absolutely can hear the new theme in the last minute. Beautiful, and this soundtrack is so perfect for the movie! And the Enhanced Version, with the Howard Shore Introspective, is actually quite fun to watch, you feel like you know the music better after watching Howard Shore, the orchestra and the singers recording the music in studios. I can recommend this to all soundtrack-lovers, you will have to look for a long time to find anything better than this! Buy it, it's worth MORE than the money! To listen to this music is like taking a long, relaxing vacation.

The brain cannot tell the difference between \\"out\\" there and its own process (eg \\"phantom limb\\" syndrome).<br />With respect to the role of mind in Medicine he quotes Siegal (author Love, Medicine and Miracles). Siegal sees this as a sign of tremendous hope,(p87) an indication that if one has the power to create sickness, one also has the power to create wellness.<br />And another quote from psychologist Keith Floyd. \\"Contrary to what everyone knows is so, it may not be the brain that produces consciousness, but rather consciousness that creates the appearance of the brain-matter,space,time and everything else we are pleased to interpret as the physical universe\\" (p160)<BR>(In other words the brain is the effect of mind and not the cause!)<br /> <BR>With respect to quantum physics he notes that small \\"particles\\" literally have no dimensions. (This would be consistent with say being a projection)<br />The quote by the way that &quot;a grain of sand contains all the information out of which the universe is made&quot; which is attributed to Blake in the \\"Holographic Universe\\" is also attributed to Jesus in \\"A Course in Miracles.\\"<br />Talbot also uses the holographic theory to explain Marian visions, as does Gary R Renard in Disappearance of the Universe.<br />UFO's are also explained as being the physical manifestations of human (or nonhuman??) subconscious.<br />Some other insights of the power of mind are<br />1) The stigmatists. Starting with St Francis of Assisi, a group of mystics were able to alter skin blood vessels etc to create the wounds incurred by Christ. This is attributable to autosuggestion (and not divine intervention!). The mind altering normal body physiology to produce the result.<BR>2) Hawaiian firewalkers. After undertaking various mind training exercises by the shamans, Hawaiians are able to walk across hot lava without harm, something that would be impossible under normal physics. Clearly the mind of the firewalkers alters the local physical environment in some way.<br />Strengths<br />1) Offers a scientific theory for the illusory nature of the \\"physical\\" world\\".<BR>2) Offers support for the concept that we can create our own reality. That it is mind that causes body effect. This can be used to treat \\"dis-ease\\"!<br />Weaknesses<BR>1) There is only one major physicist to draw on: David Bohm.<BR>2) The quotation of various biological experiments does not get it all together In fact the brain is as illusory as the rest of the body, and mind must be separate from it as well. <br />Spiritual Correlates<br />For 1500 years the fact that the world is illusory  is known to Hindu yogis&gt; the illusion is referred to as the \\"Maya\\" in Sanskrit.. In the Twentieth Century \\"A Course in Miracles\\" also states that the world is illusory, a dream of a mind outside of space and time<br />In Summary Talbot is on the right track. He however tries to string too many anecdotes in without rigidly sticking to his original theory. Despite that..A must read.
0671027387|4.0|This book reads like a cross between Jeffrey Archer and Clive Cussler (not only adventure, but adventure at the ends of the earth and in the sea).  Lots of political intrigue mixed with life threatening adventure.  The heroine is torn between loyalty to her father, and what she thinks is moral and just.  The president comes off as sometimes a good guy, sometimes a bad guy - you have to wait to the end to find out the truth (which is nice).  Dan Brown did an excellent job of creating a most unusual story with just enough scientific background to lend it enough credibility to make it a fun read.  I loved how after the car was bombed, the reader had to wait several chapters to find out who was killed.  The suspense was killing me.<br />Overall, I found this book more enjoyable than The DaVinci Code.  So if you are like me and like Clive Cussler's books, you must try this one out.
B00000I2PG|5.0|I first saw these guys on MTV many moons ago and thought to myself, &quot;Dorks.&quot;  The music was pretty good but they all looked too nerdy, and being a young teenager at the time I wasn't about to be stigmatized as somebody who listens to ABC.  What a mistake that was.  It wasn't until I was 32-years-old that I started to feel a nostalgia for the glory days of New Wave.  So I started exploring the possibilities.  I picked up &quot;Dare&quot; by The Human League (finally), and then I convinced myself to get this album.  The music is both catchy and intricate, while never coming off goofy.  The real star of this album is producer Trevor Horn.  His contribution to the album cannot be measured.  All the instruments are crisp and vital, memorable genius.  This is a must-have for anyone with even the slightest interest in 80s New Wave.  This is a sparkling gem.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I am a long-time fan of Joss Whedon's other TV projects (Buffy and Angel) but certainly no brain-washed sycophant. I bought this DVD on import as it is unavailable in the UK at the moment, and I don't get the cable channel it has been airing on. I was a little bit concerned that I might have wasted my money (not liking westerns, and jaded with Star Trek) -and as the first episode began I thought I really had -the dialogue seemed uninspired, the sets a bit \\"stagey\\", things in general seemed a bit drab and uninvolving. <br />But, boy, is it a grower. <br />By the end of this two hour pilot (\\"Serenity\\") I was convinced that this was one of the most bold, engaging, emotionally satisfying pieces of science-fiction TV I had seen in a long time. The special effects in space are really nicely done, and I adored the atmospheric use of Ry Cooder/Paris Texas style guitars for the background music. I could not believe that there wasn't a single principal character that I didn't like or find interesting in some way, and I really appreciated the way that the humour is quite restrained/underplayed -which enables the dramatic tension to be sustained and lends a sense of authenticity to the relationships (as we don't all spend our days wittily quipping to each other).<br />It beggars belief that Fox didn't air this pilot first  -it sets up all the characters beautifully, gets you emotionally invested in them, and creates interesting lines of tension between their various agendas. <br />Obviously its not PERFECT, but first seasons never are (you have to give a show time to find its feet, establish its identity, build an audience......thanks, Fox) -as it stands, it has to represent one of the most cohesive, entertaining and promising starts I've seen in a long time. <br />The show is also really something different. If you want Star Trek -go buy Star Trek. If you want Farscape, likewise. Firefly offers engaging characters, a uniquely moody atmosphere, wry and hard-bitten humour, and awillingness to break from formula and audience expectations. And, yes, its fun!<br />Oh, and did I mention that it also features the most beautiful actress in the universe? (Morena Baccarin).<br />Now stop reading and go buy! Shoo!
0767830555|5.0|Relations:<BR>\\"Taxi Driver\\" has proved to be one of my favorite films and relates to other figures in Hollywood and literature. \\"Taxi Driver\\" relates to James Dean (from \\"East of Eden,\\" \\"Rebel Without a Cause,\\" and \\"Giant\\"), and Holden Caulfield (the alienated hero from J.D. Salingers \\"The Catcher in the Rye.\\" All three figures, wheather real or unreal, film or literature, are equally alienated from society, live/has lived in New York, not to mention that they all suffer(ed) from insomnia.<BR>In \\"The Catcher in the Rye\\" Holden gets tough in front of the mirror (never says any dialogeue while getting \\"tough\\"), in \\"Taxi Driver,\\" Travis Bickle gets tough in the mirror (this time with dialogue.<BR>Holden calls a majore portain of society \\"phonies,\\" while Travis Bickle calls a majore portain of society \\"scums.\\"<BR>Holden talks about how he hates the movies, yet he see's a lot of movies. Travis talks about how he despizes the sex on the streets yet watches XXX rated movies.<BR>Holden talks to his sister in the novel that if he were to be anything, he would be a catcher in the rye, someone who saves kids from falling out of the Field of Rye, in other words: saving kids from growing up, stop litte boys from becoming violent and most recognizalby for girls to remain virgins, in \\"Taxi Driver,\\" Travis Bickles worries of a teenage prostitute get the best of him and he wants to save her.<br />Mysteries:<BR>Travis is not really that specific about his past, all we know about him is how old he was (26), his clean driving record, and that he was once in the military, nothing more, we don't know where he grew up, of his parents (with the exception that they're wedding anniversary and \\"mother's\\" birthday is in July). In one of the essays on \\"The Catcher in the Rye,\\" Holden is reffered to as a \\"rebel without a past,\\" this seems to be the case with Travis Bickle.<BR>When Travis meets Betsy, we are never really know how she really feels about Travis. It's not until the third or fourth viewing that you can tell by the way Betsy talks to Travis that she's not really sincere with him. In fact she may have even ben playing with him. Others might argue with that, which is why Betsys true feelings for Travis are a mystery.<BR>Also, the end of the film remains a mystery, we're not really sure about what happends to Travis after the shootout, others would easily say that Travis recoveres from a coma and slowley returnes to civilization, but we're not really sure of wheather what happends is the reality in the film or Travis's final thoughts as he slowely dies from his wounds after the shootout. Most would want to believe that the ending is the films reality, (including myself).<br />Wheather film fact or film fiction, relation or no relation, \\"Taxi Driver\\" to this day remains one of the most powerful films about alienation.<BR>'nuff said.
B00005JM02|4.0|This is an ok movie but I expected more. Like more laughs and stuff. It's an ok movie but not as good and funny as monsters inc. and toy story. I recommend those instead. This movie isn't really great but I do like the dialoged. This movie is pretty good and so is the special features but..........I wouldn't buy it. Wait till it gets cheaper. Sorry I can't be much. Actually I'm not I just want someone to put helpful, but now I'm pretty sure no ones going to put helpful now.
B00003CXZ4|5.0|This is truly an original film.  Once in a while a film or filmmaker comes along and completely destroys all conventional ideas about how to make a movie.  This film is told in reverse order and by the end it completes a loop where the viewer could push 'play' on his DVD player and continue with the story, forever.  From the very first scene it is obvious that something unusual is about to happen.  The photography itself is run in reverse to set the tone of the story.  Not to be lost in the disjointed narrative are three great acting performances from Carrie-Anne Moss, Joe Pantoliano, and most notably the lead actor, Guy Pearce, whose role in \\"L.A. Confidential\\" began my personal respect for his talent.  This is high quality filmmaking on all levels.  It is true that the first time I saw this, by movie's end, I wanted to scream.  The director, Christopher Nolan, forces the audience to remember each previous scene in detail leading up to the end, thus making the audience identify with the main character who suffers from short-term memory loss.  This is a unique film, and I am proud to have it in my collection.  Later.
0385504209|1.0|Has Dan Brown deliberately ripped off Lynn Picknett and Clive Prince's<br />famous 1997 investigative book<br />The Templar Revelation?<br />Judge for your selves and as will many who have read the results of 7 years<br />hard investigative research presented in The Templar Revelation.<br />It is shameless to allow the public to think that Dan Brown came up with<br />these ideas on his own, so I will speak out.<br />It was L Picknett and C Prince and NOT Dan Brown that<br />discovered the heretical symbolism in Leonardo's<br />paintings. In any case, Brown gets it wrong. Although<br />he lifts their material re The Virgin of the Rocks without acknowledgement,<br />he<br />completely misses the point.

B000000H64|5.0|I remember seeing Fear Factory back in 96; one of the best bands then and still of now. Best double bass drummer ever, Dino kicks ass, and who wouldn't kill for a crushing voice like this guys'? Mix in some `80's new-wave synthasizer stuff, and you're set for life. Great band; good as Nirvana, Tool and Radiohead. That's all.
B000060P79|3.0|When I first bought this cd, the only singles were &quot;Im just a kid&quot; and &quot;I do anything&quot;. I loved those songs, then when addicted came out, I liked it at first, then it got annoying when they kept playing it over and over again, on mtv,radio, and stuff, then it was just plain crap. &quot;perfect&quot; now is good cause everyone can relate but addicted got annoying. Only get this cd if its less than 3 bucks and new, but don't pay the price at the store. Its not worth it damn it!!
B0000509C4|4.0|The MOVIE<br />Taking a different direction than it's 1982 predecessor, this fairly standard, but fondly remembered horror compilation makes up for it's lack of frights with pure entertainment. Lacking much of the E.C. Comics style of the first movie (except for the rather poor animated intermissions) initially takes away some of the charm, but it saves the best for last. <br />&quot;Ol' Chief WoodenHead&quot;, unanimously agreed to be the weakest of the three stories on offer, is almost saved by a charming yet sad performance by George Kennedy. This is a typical revenge story with not a single interesting or unpredictable twist. Most of the violence takes place off camera, and it is actually a bit of chore to sit through.  <br />&quot;The Raft&quot; is one of the foremost guilty pleasures in horror. Four friends are stalked by a man(and duck)-eating blob in an off-limits lake. Who will survive? Those familiar with these sorts of moral tales will hardly be surprised by the ending, but will not be any less amused with it's abrupt simplicity. <br />In &quot;The Hitchhiker&quot; an annoying, unfaithful woman gets her just desserts, though at the expense of an innocent life. By the end of this story I am always a little bored, probably because the colorful, perfectly-lengthed &quot;The Raft&quot; precedes it, but it is still my favourite. In my opinion it features the most interesting gore effects, and will always be remembered for the hitchhikers immortal, extremely quotable single line of dialogue.<br />The DVD<br />As for the DVD itself - this is no special edition, but it's as much as we can expect from a movie such as this. Frankly, we should be grateful it is on DVD at all, and has not been forgotten in the dusty vaults of VHS where it probably belongs. Surprisingly, the widescreen enhanced transfer on offer is extremely clear and mostly scratch-free for a movie of it's age and budget.<br />The mono sound track on offer is not so impressive, but once again, it could be a lot worse. A movie such as this does not need a 5.1 mix; there are very few opportunities for surround usage - the whole thing is basically dialogue with occasional music to suit the mood.<br />The extras are basically non-existent, with only a trailer and photo gallery, but at the price this DVD is going at, nobody is really in a position to complain.
B0000VAFNQ|5.0|When I first heard about this movie, I have to admit it intrigued me, however I was really skeptical that another Vampire could possibly keep my attention, however, I was dead wrong! Never during this movie was I bored. The action was surprising entertaining, and the film was shot beautifully (I LOVE the lighting!). The theme is also something I've never seen dealt with prior to this movie. 'Underworld' is by far my new favorite movie, &amp; I have absolutely no regrets of purchasing this film without viewing it first in theatres. I anticipate a sequel, although I hope it doesn't follow the cliche and make a sequel that totally does the original no justice. If your having trouble choosing a movie that'll keep your attention, then this movie is for you.
B00009UW0N|5.0|This is a great film. It's also a great DVD. The special features are good too. The commentary is fantastic. This is the greatest horror film of all time, but it's not the scariest. Exorcist isn't either, read the book exorcist instead. This film is creepy, scary, and just plain brilliant. In this film you see Michael Myers's face, you see it in part 5 too. This is a great film for you horror freaks out there. Watch this with your girlfriend. Creep her out you know, then shell have to hold on to somebody (heheheheheheheheh),if you catch my griff (hehehehe) ahhhhh...I'm such an idiot. Anyways watch this and you wont be an idiot. I still haven't gone out of watching beavis and butthead do America, still stupid since that. That's funny though, watch that too. Uhhhhh please put helpful c'mon......ahhh....c'mon...c'mon. All your mean. This isn't helping is it. Uhhhh watch it there I'm helpful.
B000089CKH|5.0|Yes, you heard me. Few bands can shake free the moniker of \\"One Hit Wonder\\", and to those who aren't familiar, Brooklyn, NY's Nada Surf had their brush with 15 minutes of fame several years ago with a major label release entitled \\"High/Low\\" as well as a chart topping single \\"Popular\\". Critics and music listeners alike were quick to write the band off as a flash in the pan, and those like myself who didn't know any better, paid no mind to the band's slow decline into obscurity.<BR>Sure enough, last year and the indie label Barsuk records (home of popular indie rock gems such as Kind of Like Spitting, Death Cab For Cutie, The Prom, etc) came to Nada Surf with open arms, offering them to serve up a sophomore effort to their brief stint with mainstrem success, and prove to their listeners as well as their naysayers that their talents run deeper than a shallow radio jingle, and there is more to them than what was expected years before. Sure enough, the album \\"Let Go\\" was released to fans, both eager and skeptical.<BR>Without question, Let Go is a perfect recording, and a nice break from every other rock outfit attempting to make waves with pompous critics and indie rock fans worldwide. From the start-off acoustic track \\"Blizzard of '77\\", the listener can be drawn in, yet still unaware and unsure of the band's intentions with this record. However, right away into track 2, you are quickly thrown for a loop, as the band shows you its lighter side and offers up a pop rock gem \\"Happy Kid\\" that could easily fit in on any modern rock radio station's playlist. Then just as you think you'll be toe-tapping through the rest of the record, songs like \\"Inside of Love\\", \\"Blonde on Blonde\\", and \\"Killian's Red\\" show up, and serve you a dark, more haunting side of the band, which to me seems to be their most solid material. I could dissect every song and break down what its worth, but I can sum it up by simply saying that there isn't one split second on this album that is predictable. This is the quintessential \\"give you goose bumps\\" album. Its gutsy, catchy, yet daring, and most of all, breaks new ground as well as smash apart every negative or reluctant prejudice displayed for this band. If you dig pop rock at its finest, do not pass this up. The only reason I gave it 5 stars is because I couldn't give it 6!<BR>Best album of the year! BELIEVE IT, SUCKA!
B000005YZM|5.0|What an album. I got this last week and have listened to it in my car ever since. Very, Very Good. The best songs to me are probably \\"Maybe After He's Gone\\", \\"Brief Candles\\", and \\"Time of the Season\\". Colin Blunstone is an incredibly good singer, with a timbre not unlike the great Carl Wilson of the Beach Boys. Only a couple of missteps- but they are quickly overtaken by the premium quality of the remaining tracks. Well worth the money and contains a few songs you will never get out of your head.

0920668372|1.0|Picture this. You are a 30 year old man. You work and own your own home. You have a child of your own, but are not married. One night, while fast asleep, an intruder sneaks in through your bedroom window. It's YOUR MOM! She slithers across the bedroom floor and slips into your bed. WHAT!? You must have taken way too much No-Doz that night, because she proceeds to cuddle you in her arms and sing to you as if you are a baby, while not even waking you. Is this author on acid? Is this author from some strange foreign land, not having the slightest idea about American culture? To any sane adult (presumably the person reading this book aloud to their child) the notion of Mom breaking into the house late at night and playing out this young mother/infant scenario with your unconscious body is downright creepy and disturbing. When I first read this book and got to that part, my jaw dropped open in disbelief that anyone would try to pass this off as an endearing and completely normal event.

B00005U8EM|5.0|This movie is probably one of my favorite movies of all time. The tone of the movie is set so right with Bill Murray as Phil. He is in his element. The movie is hilarious, but Phil does a great job of reenacting his days over and over and over again. This movie was released a long time ago, but the dvd sales rank is 431. That is still pretty high considering how old this movie is. <br />The real thing that catches my interest with this film is the way it conveys drama, yet is uplifting. Although Phil runs into some tear-jerker moments that make you feel sad, the movie truly uplifts your heart in the end and makes you feel great. I have seen countless movies that were dramas, and they left me feeling depressed. I really love how Phil starts to realize that you have to make the best of things.<br />The movie is really great. I can't understand why this movie would receive a negative review. Each day is truly interesting considering you have seen it, but Phil changes his routines, and changes a great deal over the course of the film. 5 stars. I recommend this movie to anyone who just wants to feel good.

0679428895|4.0|Pompeii by Richard Harris is an historic novel that takes place over four days; two prior to the eruption of Mt. Vesuvius and the two days of the eruption.  Winchester provides a glimpse of Rome; both its glory and its ghastly.  Readers are treated to historic facts.  For instance, the aqueducts which supplied the city of Rome actually provided more water than the city water authority provided to New York City until 1985.   However, many of Romes repulsive attributes are also on display, such as the thriving institution of slavery, rampant sexual depravity and gluttony.  The protagonist, Marcus Attilius will not disappoint.  He is an honest, hard-working civil servant.  Pompeii was as interesting as it was well written.
0140441409|4.0|If you are at all interested in the history of philosophical or theological thought, then you will want to acquaint yourself with the writings of Marcus Aurelius.  In this work addressed to himself (he originally entitled it &quot;To Myself&quot; and it later came to be known as the &quot;Meditations&quot;) he distills the essence of Stoicism, one of the most important and influential schools of classical philosophy.  The Staniforth translation combines elegance and clarity, and the introduction and notes are excellent, so the Penguin edition is probably the one to go for, although some reviewers here seem to favor the Hays translation, which looks to be more direct and colloquial.  Staniforth argues persuasively that Stoicism formed the rational basis for the fledgling Christian theology.  (Interestingly, there is one, rather disparaging, reference to Christians in the text, which I suppose illustrates how significant the movement had become, a century after the death of its founder.  Many scholars believe this to be an interpolation by a later author).  Indeed, the similarity of this work to the late medieval &quot;The Imitation of Christ&quot; is striking.  Part of the fascination of &quot;Meditations&quot; lies, of course, in the fact that Marcus was emperor of Rome, the greatest power on Earth at that time.  We thus get an insight into the mind of an important historical character.  This also means that much of what occupied him is hardly relevant to you or me.  How many of us are plagued with sycophantic courtiers, or need to remind ourselves that the adulation of the mob may be short-lived?  Yet it is clear that, despite all his power and privilege, Marcus was a troubled and pensive soul.  One might say that &quot;Meditations&quot; is Stoicism for monarchs, whereas &quot;The Imitation&quot; is Stoicism for monks.  If you enjoy one of those books, the chances are you will enjoy the other.
B00008EYA5|2.0|The DVD cover and back say: \\"Best cop film since 'Training Day'\\" and \\"A solid action movie with a lot of heart and soul\\". EEEHHHH!! Wrong!! What the heck does \\"heart and soul\\" mean in the context of this whoooosh-boom-ratata kind of movie? <br />This film is like Top Gun, except without the class of Tony Scott as director. Let's see, the first hour of the movie is almost exclusively a corporate training video for potential SWAT recruits. There were obviously lots of ex-SWATers on hand to ensure authenticity. So after the hour is over, we learn there are bad egg members of SWAT too. Wow. Like the first 10 minutes didn't already spoil that. The film moves along at an OK pace from then on, but it's too-little-too-late to engross us anymore, because we look at the DVD running time and realise, well it's time to wrap this baby up soon, so you can rattle off all your predictions on what will happen.<br />But here's why I felt like I was watching some promotional how-to video as opposed to an action flick: The score (music), lighting, and camera work that accompany some of the training scenes are way too pretentious and obvious to captivate the viewer. Within seconds you start to ask yourself, why am I supposed to feel the suspense, when the characters in this movie are all just training with paint guns? It's just silly. This is an example of a movie that puts to much effort into honestly portraying the training of a member of a SWAT team and not enough into, hey, it's an action flick!! You've got Samuel L. Jackson, Colin Farrell, LL Cool J, and Michelle Rodriguez (who is becoming a B-movie actress thanks to not challenging herself to do more gritty work like her 'Girlfight' debut), and Olivier Martinez. Let the viewers have some fun. We're the ones who pay for this shlock. <br />Let me put it like this: If I decide to make a documentary about baking my homemade christmas cookies, perhaps I can move and rivet the viewer with all the meticulous detailed work and effort involved in shaping and baking the cookies. But if this is a movie to be consumed (pun intended) by the mass audience, then I'll have to figure out how to make it entertaining. So if S.W.A.T. is supposed to be a documentary or training video, well hey, mission accomplished. But we're making an action movie, right? That's based on a TV series, which had a plot occasionally too, right? <br />The DVD: I actually liked the deleted scenes. They added some sorely lacking humour as well as some of that \\"heart and soul\\" that would have given the characters zest. As for the commentaries, I am of the opinion that the director's commentary and that of the actors should have been on separate tracks, because not only were they recorded separately, but their moods are totally conflicting. Johnson's comments are low-key details and thoughts, and the actors are boisterous. Weird to listen to. The 'making of' was just plain annoying; I couldn't hear what anyone was saying, because the dumb music was given priority over the comments. <br />In closing: If Tony Scott had directed this, it would have been R-rated, and may have not made as much money at the theaters. But he would have lent the movie the authenticity that the producers wanted without alienating the viewers who came to see some good old fashioned action.<br />Rent it first. If you like it, ignore my comments and buy it.
B00005JLD4|5.0|Rabbit proof fence was one of the best films that i have seen to date. Great Cinematography, great acting, and a heart warming story. My only concern is that with all other review that i have read thus far, it seems that of the American reviewers completely understand the &quot;stolen generation&quot; situation. i found it rather odd particularly from one reviewer from seattle, saying that neither side was completely right, unless you consider sleeping int he dirt, eating lizards and bugs, and no &quot;proper&quot; education Right. Saying this is exactly what the movie was showing. that THe &quot;WHite&quot; Australians where trying to assimilate the Native aborigionies to be &quot;White Australians&quot;. Basically trying to remove there customs, beliefs, and way of life. Eating bugs, lizards, kangaroo's, berries is traditional bush tucker. sleeping in the dirt with leaves as a mattress is what they did. It is the Indigenous Australian way of life. The film was showing an event which happened in Australia's past, and how while the &quot;White Australians&quot; might not have been completely wrong, as they did have the native Australians interests at heart, they where simply trying to do what they thought was right with their view of that era.<br />whilst the stolen generation incident happened 74 years ago, it is still an event which is still in the political headlines. THis film allows us as Australians, reflect on this incident, and look forward to the future and learn from our predicesors mistakes.
B00005K2UF|5.0|Increasingly, the New York Voices is becoming recognized as the best vocal jazz ensemble in the business, and this album is &quot;Exhibit A&quot; for that proposition.  &quot;Don't Be That Way&quot; is my personal favorite:  for 4 singers to be together in harmony at breakneck tempo like this is a wonderment to behold.  And &quot;Save Your Love For Me&quot; rivals anything that came out of Motown.  Besides the fact that the Voices sound tremendous as an ensemble, individually their voices are superb; and nowhere is this more evident than the set-ender &quot;I'll Be Seeing You&quot;, an a capella answer to the oft-sung &quot;Berkeley Square&quot; done by the Manhattan Transfer and virtually every other amateur vocal jazz group in the U.S.  Special word about Darmon Meador:  He may be the best young male jazz singer around right now.  Don't be surprised if he breaks out and goes solo someday.
B0000VCZKM|1.0|But maybe if enough of us say it, the company will actually DO something about it!  WHAT IS UP WITH NOT HAVING A WIDESCREEN VERSION!?!?  I was definitely going to purchase this special edition until I saw it was only available in full screen.  I'm just so glad that I got the previous release, since they were actually smart enough to add widescreen to that version.  I'll skip the special features if I have to.  By the way, I would have loved to seen the &quot;Lights, Camera, Annie!&quot; behind the scenes documentary that another reviewer posted about.  Well, I hope they get it right when they release yet another version in a few years.
B0000AQZYM|5.0|Although I didn't get a chance to finish seeing the movie, it was hilarious.  I couldn't help but laugh as Marlin and Dorrie were searching for Marlin's son Nemo who was taken and put in a fish tank.  Dorrie could never seem to remember anything but yet was a good companion for Marlin, who hadn't been happy since his wife died.  He was protective of Nemo from the day he was in an egg.  Seeing his son being taken by a human being frightened him.  It was a good movie to watch and I hope to see it again and this time watch the whole thing.
B00008J4P5|1.0|If this band is going to save rock 'n roll, then it's shame for rock 'n roll.  When a no-talent drummer (with \\"endearingly amateurish\\" skills) and a vocalist whose range I could match with a few choice farts make it big, you know the music world is going down the drain.  Fresh, new, original?!  I'll give 'em points for style, putting on a show, but musically one shouldn't put White Stripes on a pedastal.  Garage rock has its charms, but, please, don't pass it off as art-house rock or art for that matter.  This whole indie rock movement has gone too far.  All you need are a pair of tight jeans and a t-shirt two sizes too small and you're an immediate hit.  Innovation, skill and talent don't seem to count much anymore and, in that context, White Stripes is no better than cookie-cutter productions like N*Sync or Avril Lavigne.  It's a sad, sad day when you buy this album, support this genre of \\"music\\" by buying this album, or wear one of those stupid \\"sporty\\" jackets.
B00000F6LQ|4.0|For all you Python fans out there this is great.  Everything from the chase the killer rabbit mode to the Japanese dubbed version to the subtitle for people who don't like the film, this DVD has it all.  There is but one snaffoo.  I think the Pythons designed this DVD case themselves as a joke.  There are two disks with one spindle.  Supposedly they both fit on the spindle, which is possible, but the problem is that the people who assemble these little DVD box sets are too lazy to put it on correctly.  So what happens?  The disks get scratched.  When I bought it at [We will soon be taking over the world and have a hobby of destroying the economies of small countries]mart mine was scratched so I took it back.  I got my new one and it was scratched.  I sat with the service person opening every single copy of the DVD only to find that all of them were scratched.  Wow-nice one DVD packing people.  Lets put some more pride in our work!  Anyway the DVD itself is marvelous.  Buy it!
B000092T6M|2.0|This entire movie is simply in bad taste.  The worst - - a vicious rape attempt is treated as a comedy skit.  When I saw this movie in the theater, the audience laughed through the whole scene.  I've worked as a rape counselor, and, believe me, there is nothing funny about it.  And the cheap cameo ending seemed more suitable for a TV sitcom.  Very poorly directed - - no one seems to have a clear idea what this movie is about as far as tone or intent; the actors seem to have rehearsed for different movies and only come together accidentally.  I did give it two stars instead of one because there are a few good scenes, and some of the characters are amusing for a while (and Costner has an undeniable charm).  And, I realize this may put me in the minority, but I really appreciate that Kevin Costner did not try to sound English.  I'm tired of phony accents in movies.  I have an imagination and have no problem accepting that I am supposed to believe he is a 12th Century Englishman. And none of the accents were authentic -- 12th C. English would be unintelligible to us.  All the actors were using the &quot;wrong&quot; accents and the wrong words.  So forget that silly criticism about Costner's lack of accent.  It's irrelevant.
B00006LSM3|5.0|At first playing I was disappointed and decided that Brainwashed was the red headed stepchild of cloud 9. It did not take too many more listens to realize that Brainwashed is a superior cd and I have not been able to stop listening ever since. Of course it is bittersweet but what a swan song. Here we witness not only the genius of George Harrison but also the inner strength and focus of a man who created what I feel is his best work all the while aware of his impending death. To me this is an extraordinary feat. Through it all he retained his sense of humor for which I am very grateful. His Dylanesque title track just about says it all and justifiably spares no one. Stuck inside a Cloud is at once a tear jerker and philisophical while being the most melodic track on the cd. The break in \\"Never get over You\\" is classic Harrison and reminds us that Harrison played a much bigger role in the sound of the Beatles than people realize. I love the staccato singing of the lyric....it....was....a....moon....lit....night....you....came....in...to....my liiiiiife...this is a sweet piece of work that almost rivals Something. \\"Any Road\\" reminds us ala 60's lingo that isn't it so far out that the way out is in? \\"Vatican Blues\\" wryly bops along as Harrison once again makes the most of simplicity. \\"Pisces Fish\\" is comical in its visions and lyrics but also has a very sedating affect and is a very peaceful and melodic track. I could go on but there is no need. Go out and buy this last work from Harrison and you will not be disappointed.
B000050HTO|2.0|I have over 2000 cd's and 100 records.  So I am a fan of music dating back in to the blues of the 30s.  Anyway I had never really owned any bob dylan...until now.  This dual cd set is a good collection for the dylan first timer...but to me he still CAN NOT SING.  I will admit the songwriting for 40 years ago was unique.  But now I feel people collect dylan just to look cool or emulate some nostalgic respect.<br />I will keep this cd but doubt I will ever play it again.<br />I also bought blonde on blonde...even more disapointing.
0767836324|3.0|Only Spielberg could have assembled this dream cast: Maggie Smith as the aged Wendy, Robin Williams as the grown-up Peter Pan, Dustin Hoffman as Hook, Bob Hoskins as Smee and Julia Roberts as Tinkerbell.  The film has an interesting premise -- Peter has grown up and forgotten his past, but must remember if he is to rescue his two children from Hook -- but it takes too long to get going and it hasn't aged particularly well.  It's still worth a watch but more of a rental than to buy.<br />The DVD extras are -- not there.  There are trailers for Hook and Jumanji, and past credits for Spielberg, Hoffman, Roberts, Williams and Hoskins (why not Smith?).  That's it.  The film can be heard or subtitled only in English.
B0000CFW87|5.0|First of all I just want to say that mbhsxt from Cleveland has no critique value at all.  they obviously do not know real talent if it slapped him in the face with a sledgehammer.  This cd is outstanding.  I have his first album, and just recently purchased his second album.  Each album will get better and better.  This young man will go VERY FAR
0671027344|5.0|I thought this book was amazing.  When I saw the MTV logo on the spine, I had my doubts about whether I should read it or not.  I figured I'd give it a shot anyway and I was happy that I did.  I don't think it should be compared to The Cather In the Rye as much as it is, though.  Sure it's all about teenage angst... but it will never live up to the Catcher in the Rye.  <br />That being said... I'd just like to add that I read a lot of books.  I usually don't go anywhere without a book.  It kind of disappoints me that people are saying that the only people who like this book are people who don't read.  That's not entirely true.<br />I thought this book was very well written and I loved the letter format, it added a more personal touch to this book.  Charlie was a very interesting character and it was very entertaining to hear his thoughts.<br />I wouldn't go as far as to say that this book changed my outlook on life or that it made me a different person, but it provided good entertainment for a couple hours and I felt good after I had finished it.
B00006L83N|4.0|Ok, first i really like this cd evryone is super talented.  HOwever thi is not my opinion of great.  MIchael romeo is an outstanding guitarist its just that he sounds a bit too much like a certain swede, noneheless he can really play its jsut that it is somewhat unoriginal.  his riffs are very heavy and have great tone.  Many people compare this band to dream theater an i definitely see the comparisons, at points it sounds lie dream theater with yngwie playing the solos.  Also many people compare michael romeo to john petrucci, in my opinion i see petrucci as being a much better guitarist he has more muscle in his playing where as romeo is vry delicte in his touch on the solos.  Also petrucci can be in credibly melodic at times and once again i find romeos playing to be a little unoriginal and repetitive.  NOw though the singer from symphony x blows James la Brie away a agreat vocalist for this genre.  All in all i recommend this cd but, it does not deserve the hype it gets
B00005JLYW|5.0|Anyone who is rating this movie with one star doesn't understand the goal of the movie.  The editorial review describes this movie perfectly.  It's a fun, visually dazzling, no-brainer, movie.  It's not supposed to have a crazy, complex plot or profound dialogue.  It's a release - pure and simple.  Get lost in the fun of this movie and turn off the over-analytical part of your brain!
0792839749|1.0|Pretty bad quality, next time I'll order a previously viewed selection rather than Amazon's new product!
B0000A98ZP|5.0|As far as the movie being \\"dated\\", that is actually a major part of its appeal in my opinion.  The dancing scenes look like \\"80s MTV videos\\", yes, but considering the direction MTV, VH1, and music (and really, just about everything else in this world) have taken since the mid-90s, some of us long for those cheesy 80s days.      The characters are stripped down to the most simple definitions of their given stereotypes, but that makes the movie a lot less complicated, and easier to watch.  A most basic look at high school life, even to this day I would imagine.    Fantastic movie, perfectly cast and acted, well-written.  See it.
B00005JLWN|5.0|If you're not put off by violence, this is an AMAZING film. It's basically Fahrenheit 451 crossed with every &quot;Gunfight&quot; movie ever made. It's a postapocalyptic future where emotions must be suppressed to keep mankind from having a 4th world war. However, the cure is worse than the disease, as the &quot;Grammaton Clerics&quot; wipe out everyone with even a shred of emotion. Christian Bale is GREAT, as are Sean Bean and Emily Watson. Taye Diggs, who is normally good, gets a bit irritating here as a treacherous lawman. Also the film is a bit flawed here and there...even those who supposably aren't 'feeling' show plenty of emotion in various scenes; killing nine people to save a puppy seems a bit ridiculous; and some of the bad guys can't shoot worth a DAMN, even when they're SURROUNDING a target! However, this film has some of the most amazing gunfights ever filmed, courtesy of Kurt Wimmer's &quot;Gun Katas&quot;, which make gunfights into swordfights at the same time. A very underrated film, well worth the money.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|As a baby-boomer, I was taken aback at how wonderfully enjoyable this DVD set was.  I did not watch it when it was on television, but discovered it by watching the set I bought for my daughter as something for the entire family to enjoy.  I am not a fan of science fiction so I was not expecting to like the show, and was pleasantly surprised.  It reminded my of the early `Star Trek' with a mixture of 'Mavrick' and 'Support Your Local Sheriff'.  The tongue in cheek humor was especially enjoyable and I expected it would be the new genre in Science Fiction television. It was bitter sweet to learn that there would be no future episodes to watch. I would highly recommend this to anyone looking for substantive entertainment, even if you are not a fan of Sci-fi, or Westerns, the seamless miscellany of the two take a back seat to inspired writing and salient character development.
B00008PW2D|3.0|I am absolutely in LOVE with this show.  I don't have HBO so I wait for the DVDs to come out to watch them for the first time.  So, you can imagine my utter disappointment when Season Five was only EIGHT episodes!  For the price that my husband paid to get it for me as a Christmas gift...not worth the money spent!  It slightly fed my addiction, although it left me longing for so much more.  And I can't believe there is only one more season to go.  I gave Sex and the City Season Five only three stars: five stars for the fabulous eight episodes, but one star for only having eight.  I am REALLY going to miss these gals.
B000060OFT|5.0|First of all, to all the negative reviewers, u guys can bite me! lol To the rest of the supporters, i'm with ya! Leonardo &amp; Claire are awesome. They are PERFECT for this remaking!!!! I love this version far more than any other and i have both of the Leo &amp; Claire versions (Special Edition &amp; the other one). My favorite scenes were when they first noticed eachother (Leo &amp; Claire) through the aquarium at the Capulet party. Then i liked when Romeo jumped out of the car to go back for Juliet when the party was over. Soooo romantic.... :)&quot;Did my heart love till now? Forswear in sight, for i never saw true beauty till this night&quot; - Romeo to Juliet :)Leonardo DiCaprio &amp; Claire Danes are the BEST!!!!
B00004ZB9D|5.0|Lenny is such an awsome musican,  he can write great rock songs as well as ballads, and even soulful songs. Lenny is also a pretty decent guitar player.<br />Lennys greatest hits is a great introduction in to Lennys music, it has all his best songs, all his great rock songs like 'Are You Gonna Go My Way' 'Fly Away' and 'American Woman' it also has the best of his soul work like 'I Belong To You' and 'Heaven Help' but you also get a few funky numbers like 'Always On The Run' and 'Black Velvetine' this a great way for anyone to get into Lenny Kravitz, but Ill let you know once you hear this your gonna want to buy his albums to.
B00005JM02|5.0|I love the Pixar animation. It's so much more fun than cartoons for adults to watch. This movie has a great message for kids and a seperate message for parents.    Our kids range in age from 1 to 10 and all of us can sit down and enjoy this movie together.
B00003CXIP|5.0|Dear reader, stand by me is one of the best movies i've  seen in a long time. River Phoenix is wonderful in this movie. He can just go in there and do his thing. He works so well with Wil Wheaton. Rod Riner did a great job at all the sceens. This movie has excitement, adventure, you'll laugh you'll cry this movie is so wonderful.
B0000A118M|5.0|who said this record wasn't all that? I beg your pardon, you don't say. this record is not for a party, it's for your ears. This is pure joy. the guy that gave one star does not like jazz. listen to this late at night after your girlfriend broke up with you. this is life affirming it's hopeful it taps into all your emoticons and beyond. if i knew you i would just make you a copy but it's cheap enough. check it out when you are screwed up or to impress a lady. either way you will score.
0201633612|5.0|I found this book to be probably the best book I've read on programming in recent times.  Despite it being a bit dated, the examples convey their intended purposes without the need to be reworked to properly reflect recent changes in coding standards.  One of the reasons it took me so long to read this book was because of it's publishing date which led me to believe I would be learning C++ in the wrong direction.  However I was wrong and felt I wasted quite a bit of time putting this book off as long as I did.  Design patterns helps you think and organize your code in such a way that once you get used to it, it's hard to see programming in any other way.  You will definately become a better programmer having read this book.  You will be worser without it.
B000003TB6|5.0|i was a skeptic roots fan at first.  this changed very soon after hearing \\"Things Fall Apart.\\" After TFA i got my hands on \\"Illadelph Halflife\\".  Then \\"Do You Want More?!!!?!\\".  Then last but not least \\"Organix.\\"  \\"Do you...\\"is my favorite, The rapping by the roots is great and the band is amongst the best...i think each Roots album has a different feel, this feel is my favorite but the others are NOT to be overlooked by anymeans.  This album is relaxed and soothing but not as laid back as \\"Illadelph\\".  But the band's songs are not as hip hop geared as \\"TFA\\"...\\"Do you\\" almost sounds like a jazz album. My recomendation is get The Roots albums in this order. (TFA, Do You, Illadelph, Organix). For more in depth reviews on the other albums by me check their review sections.<br />NOTE:I have not heard any of Phrenology and therefore did not include it in my review, this by no means means you should conclude it's not worth getting...try it out and see what u think.
B0000VAFO0|3.0|This flick had so much potential and it failed to live up to my expectations.Much of the story script was not explained until the end and there was no real connection between kate beckinsale and the blond guy.Too much computer effects for the werewolves and they could of looked much better.There are some memorable moments filled with action,but ultimately these are seldom.In my opinion the movie was enjoyable but not worth owning.
B00000099Y|5.0|I regard this cd along with Nirvana's 'Nevermind', Marilyn Manson's 'Antichrist Superstar', and Nine Inch Nails' 'Downward Spiral' as being one of the best rock cd's ever created.  Every sound is beautifully placed, making one of the darkest, most amazingly harmonic walls of sound ever built.  Almost a modern day, darker version of 'The Wall' created with odd, yet meaningful intermissions between the songs.  Every person in this band is exceptionally talented.  Maynard, of course, has an amazing voice, backed by one of the best drummers and bass players alive.  Truly a masterpeice, and i would reccomend to any person who likes the darker side of rock and roll.
B000002H70|5.0|The Cure's Disintegration is the masterpiece of the last 25 years.  From the opening chimes of Plainsong, to the watery guitars on Same Deep Water as You (best Cure song ever), to breaking glass on Disintegration, and the final crying, lonely keyboard on Homesick, Robert Smith has created the most passionately depressing album ever.  The first time you listen to this album you will begin a strange love affair with it.  Sounds cascade down into your ears, guitars swirl, and Smith's voice becomes your sole purpose at that time.  Wow!
0974153001|5.0|This is a beautiful, profusely illustrated book by THE master of sculpting with polymer clay. It's 144 pages packed *full* of information. The title of this book is accurate - it's truly a &quot;step by step&quot; guide, and it's for those people who are interesting in learning to sculpt lifelike, not cutesy, figures. We've waited a long time for this one. I would have bought it at twice the price.
B000099T2L|2.0|Beyonce has a decent voice, however her vocal wobbling becomes tiresome on any track and this is something she does ad nausium on her solo debut album. The singles &quot;Crazy In Love&quot; ft. Jay-Z and &quot;Baby Boy&quot; featuring Sean Paul give the the impression that this is indeed a dance album. Wrong! With the exception of &quot;Naughty Girl&quot; the rest of the album is running on a laidback, but not necessarily better vibe. As of now she has shown nothing to warrant all the hype. I give her props for her stage engergy but this album is not my cup of tea. I have not picked it up in months and have no plans to pop it in my cd player again anytime soon.
B0000029GA|5.0|10 amazing tracks. Nothing poor on this album, the production is perfect, Nass lyrics are on an unbeliavable level. Its just sad, that Nas did &quot;too&quot; good album and he never reaches the level thats on this album, maybe no-one will.
B0000DD7NL|3.0|This album will leave you wondering just how many old albums she is in posession of because the loops and intros are so familiar it hurts. That aside, this is an enjoyable album if you are looking for an alternative to the pop sound. My personal favroties are &quot;Diary&quot;, &quot;So Simple&quot;, and &quot;You Don't Know My Name&quot;. The verdict is still out on &quot;Dragon Days&quot; because for all its interesting twists and turns I can only play it but so much. The jazz vibe &quot;Nobody Not Really&quot; has is a nice finishing track although it is listened as an interlude.
B0000025DV|5.0|This great double album(now all on 1 CD these days)contains lots of great ELO classics including:Turn To Stone,Sweet Talkin Woman,Mr. Blue Sky,Jungle,Wild West Hero,Night In The City,and It's Over!!! A great CD!!! Five stars!!! A+
B00006CXXU|4.0|Much growth from her first forumla-driven album. Her vocals leave nothing to be desired. The songs were a hit & miss with me, but again her vocals make even the so-so tracks tolerable.
B0000025DT|5.0|This great album is chock full of great ELO tunes!!! Livin' Thing,Telephone Line, Do Ya?,So Fine,Tightrope, and Rockaria! are all here on this classic album!!! Awesome!!! Two thumbs up!!! Five stars!!! A+
B00006ZCFH|4.0|I don't know about you, but I'm seriously feeling Erykah's new endeavor.  What a talented sista.<br />My favorites are Danger (#1 with a bullet) where she's a ride or die sista [this one alone worth the price of the CD], Bump It (yeah, I like to turn her s**t up loud), The Grind, and I Want You (OOOOooo, I'm wanting to hear this over and over).  Woo was not one of my favorites, although it's a catchy little tune.  I'm sick, sick, SICK of love of my life reprise, overdub, remix, all that .... over and over and over ... truly sick of it!!!!  Overall, a good effort by Erykah.  Well worth my $$.
B000001DQI|5.0|This double album(all on 1 CD these days!)is an absolute Elton John classic!!! This great album contains the classic songs:Candle In The Wind,Bennie And The Jets,Saturday Nights All Right For Fighting,Harmony,Funeral For A Friend/Love Lies Bleeding,Grey Seal,The Ballad Of Danny Bailey,All The Girls Love Alice,Sweet Painted Lady,and the title track!!! A five star album(CD)!!! Two thumbs up!!! A+
0060527978|5.0|Warrior of Light is a truly poetic book. The way Coelho wrote this book is impressively unique. The message is very compelling and touching.The book is destined to be as timeless and classic as Gibran's The Prophet. It's a masterpiece and perfect companion to The Alchemist.<br />If readers eagerly want to explore what is Coelho's \\"Philosophy of Meaningful & Spiritual Living\\", this book can be the answer. The book powerfully presents the heart of Coelho's Philosophy of Life. <br />Like The Alchemist, this book is a truly spiritual novel. And if you want to apply the concept in The Alchemist into your everyday life, Warrior of Light is a manual!!!  Valuable!!!
B0000025DR|5.0|This is album is an ELO classic!!! With such great tunes as:Evil Woman,Strange Magic,Poker,Waterfall,and Fire On High, you can't go wrong!!! An essential ELO album!!! Two thumbs up!!! Five stars!!! A+
B0000CAXIC|5.0|Ilove this cd its great, not to mention that evrlong was on it, if times like these was also on it , id give it 6 stars
B000089RVX|5.0|i first heard the song bring me to life at a WWE PPV and then not long after it became no. 1 in the charts  i took notice of the expert vocals of Amy Lee and i have never looked back.<BR>Out of the three singles released 'My Immortal' has stood out to be the most affecting. Lee's vocal stylings are extremely inspirational, the mixture of piano, grungy guitar chords and wailing solo play add to the drama and emotion. I think her lyrics are like dark poetry, and they kinda get into your mind on first listen straight away.<BR>Amy Lee has brought grunge gothic from the depressed minds of teens to the masses, its hard to find in this day and age a female musician who can write songs, play an instrument and perform live with an amazing voice.
B000089CJI|4.0|Those familiar with 'Give Up' will no doubt have heard about how the album came about through a collaboration between Dntel's Jimmy Tamborello and Death Cab's Ben Gibbard. For a run down on individual tracks, this reviewer asks you to read other critiques of the album. My only advice is to make the purchase. The album, while mainly being described as 'indie-electronica' is simply a perfect mix created by two talented music makers who just don't miss the mark with any of these songs.  I heard the first single on radio one day and took a punt on the rest of the album based solely on this awesome tune. It is an exceptional album. Take it home, turn down the lights and press play. After you've done that do it again.
B00009TB5G|5.0|I never expected this.  When I sat through it in the theater, I thought The Two Towers was too long.  I felt the battle scenes were tiring, difficult to endure.  But, having been stunned with the extended Fellowship (far superior to the theatrical release), I decided to give the Two Towers another try.<br />To put it plainly, you really haven't seen this movie until you've seen the extended version.  Humor.  Important &quot;back stories.&quot;  Better, more coherent editing.  Not only did the movie grip me and keep my attention for its entire length, I want to watch it again.  Soon.<br />This is a great investment in a great movie.  I can't recommend it highly enough for those who liked the theatrical versions, as well as those who came away disappointed to one degree or another.
B00005JM20|3.0|OK, I admit it, I am a huge Rowan Atkinson fan.  Over here, in the States, he is known mostly for being Mr. Bean and has made a nice character acting career playing loveable idiots.  However, I like him best when he is playing smart, evil characters like Balckadder (one of the best shows ever!).  <br />As Johnny English, he is again a loveable idiot - this time working for the British Secret Service.  They could have found a better plot for a movie as James Bond spoofs have been done to death by this point.  But, as a home video movie, I have to admit that I laughed aloud in places.  Basically, if you are a fan of Atkinson (or British humor in general) you will be pleasantly diverted by this movie.  If you are ignorant of British comedy, don't start with this movie or you will simply not get it.
B00005JLXE|2.0|Daredevil is empty, and silly.  Of course, you'd expect that from a movie that has a laughably bad fight/dance sequence involving Ben Affleck.  Yes, you heard right.  I was tempted to yell out, \\"Hey!  They're break dance fighting!\\"  Of course, I didn't.<br />Daredevil has plot that is mush--predictable when it ought to be surprising, dull when it ought to be exciting, and funny when it never really intends to be.  Ain't that a recipe for disaster?  I won't spend more time dissecting it because it just isn't worth it.  It represents the inevitable:  Bland corporate types seeing the Spiderman and X-Men money machines and wanting to cash in with uncreative drivel.  \\"Find me a superhero!  From Marvel if you can!  And get the Sexiest Guys on Earth to star!!  That's the ticket.\\"<br />Don't make the same mistake I made.  Don't waste a good two hours.
B00005JMFO|4.0|Anyone who says Love Actually is too saccharine is simply missing the point.  As it makes perfectly clear in the beginning, the premise of this movie is that \\"love actually is all around.\\"  Nowadays, cynicism is too often confused with wisdom, and \\"independent\\" movies that go for the cheap \\"unhappy\\" ending are really just cheating the audience.  In the movie, as in life, the characters care about being happy and are ready to put in the work to achieve happiness.<br />There are a lot of stories going on here, so we never delve that deeply into any one of the characters.  It may be simply an over-ambitious plot exercise, but I think it succeeds more than it fails.  I sat through the movie with a dopey grin on my face and I was never bored.  The only story-line that didn't pan out for me was the one concerning Laura Linney - but I won't spoil it.<br />This is a sweet, funny, life-affirming film and very entertaining.
0385504209|2.0|After hearing and reading about this book for a year, I finally borrowed a copy and read it. All I can say is I'm disappointed. While it began with an interesting premise, the writing was so mediocre that I finished it only so I could discuss the book with a friend who recommended it. It struck me as just an &quot;airplane&quot; novel - one you pick up at the airport because you're just looking for something quick and easy to pass the time. It's not even close to serious literature. I'm also scared to death there are people out there who actually believe the story. But I suppose that's all you can expect at a time when bashing the Christian Church has become an art form.
0201633612|5.0|First of all let me qualify my critique by saying that I use this book heavily and am grateful for it - every programmer should digest and drink in the material in this seminal and valuable book. However one must understand the boundaries of Design Patterns.<br />Object Oriented Programming has been the New Wave of the 80's and 90's.<BR>The initial rah-rah over encapsulation-inheritance-polymorphism faded when their benefits were hard to extract.<BR>The design patterns are one step above O-O. Heavily founded in the the main &quot;tricks&quot; behind the design patterns, are also the facets of O-O<BR>1. interface<BR>2. dynamic binding (or polymorphism)<BR>2. inheritance<BR>3. aggregation (or composition)<br />So in the future when there is the next new wave in software, I expect our paradigms to shift to something else. <BR>In short, it is a great book, but it is not in the same league as (say) a Mathematics book which will stay current for a very, very long time.<br />(As a Christian myself, I liked John Vlissides unashamed quotes from the Bible on the first page<BR>Joshua 24:15 \\"As for me and my house, we will serve the LORD\\")<br />How to read the book rapidly if you are a visually oriented person. I am a slow learner but was able to read this book in two hours:<BR>1. First, understand intimately how the four \\"tricks\\" work, mentioned above. <BR>2. Do not read in serial fashion from page 1 till end. Instead look at the structure diagram for a design pattern; meditate on it until you are blocked whereupon read the text to find the answer.
0385504209|3.0|Much of this book is based on the work of Picknett &amp; Price (Templar Revelations, 1977).  Inter alia, it was they who first proposed that Mary Magdalene might be found in The Last Supper, and whose first Chapter is called, &quot;The Secret Code of Leonardo da Vinci'.  Surely it would have been polite for Dan Brown to acknowledge their work rather than passing off the idea as his own?<br />I would have though that Dan Brown might owe them at least an apology?  If not, the words &quot;shameless rip-off&quot; spring to mind!
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I've never seen this show on TV, because I'm living in Europe so there was no way. But when I heard that Joss Wheadon's new show is available as a DVD I didn't think twice and orderd the box. My DVD-player is codefree so I had no problem watching the show.<BR>AND I WATCHED.... and watched... and couldn't stop. <BR>Two days later I couldn't belive that they have cancelled Firefly! This is the most incredible series I've ever seen! It is equal to Buffy in the profoundness and developement of the universe and dialogs!! (And I know it, since I've seen every single Buffy-Episode!)  There are so much hints for the future in every episode. They solve one mystery but there are three new secrets about what happend to the characters in the past. I also like the Chinese-English part of it very much. It's not so far-fetched. <BR>Retrospective I also like the first few episodes better as when I watched them for the first time. <br />Attention: conspiracy theory ;-)<BR>maybe FOX didn't like the political aspect of the show. The &quot;Feds&quot; and the governement are not so much liked from the main characters. People who were consistent with the system had it much easier (Tam-Family, Inara, Shepard when shot) than non-conformists. Which is way like it is this days... &quot;if you are not FOR us ... you are AGAINST us...&quot; <BR>This show does not simplify matters and maybe it is too thought-provoking. <br />Last but not least: I also enjoyed that they used the &quot;documentary style&quot; in most scenes. And the cast is incredible! <BR>And.. And... And.. ;-)
B0000TB01Y|5.0|First of all let me just say that I've seen a lot of shows in my day, particularly on broadway.  This show not only ranks in my top 5 favs, but I might venture to say that it is my absolute favorite.  Don't waste anymore time!  Get yourself to NYC and see this show!  You won't be disappointed!  The music is wonderful, the cast is amazing, and everything about the show is pure magic.  Two thumbs up from this theatre buff!!!
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Well once again, an intelligent, well written show with great acting was cancelled! This DVD set is great and can be watched again and again! The writing and directing on this series was incredible. The acting was awesome, and you can tell these actors became a family on the set. I was also glad to see that these episodes were placed in order on the DVD's ( as Fox screwed up the series by showing the pilot last.....sabotage???)The pilot really was integral to meeting all of the characters and setting the tone of the series. The three additional unaired episodes were outstanding. Including them on this DVD was smart.Great CGI effects from the team that also did the new Battlestar Gallactica mini-series (and upcoming series) for the SCI FI channel. Sometimes you have to remember you are not looking at actual footage of space! Also, enjoyed the humor. This show can make you laugh, make you cry and put you on the edge of your seat!<br />Can't wait to see the movie (if all goes well!) that is currently in pre-production. If not, I truly wish this cast and crew the best! This DVD set is entertaining and well worth the money! BONUS- Nathan Fillion's naked behind! GO CAPTAIN NO PANTS!!! (Please don't let my perversion keep you from buying this outstanding series;)
B0000TB01Y|5.0|I saw Wicked in June during the previews in San Francisco before it was even on Broadway. It is the middle of January, and it is still all I talk about! Though I sound obsessive, that is not true. I have seen many plays in my mere 14 years, and I have Best of Broadway tickets in San Francisco. I can tell you, that, as a teenager, it is amazing when I like a jacket for longer than a month. For me to hold on to anything as long as I have held on to Wicked is incredible. <BR>     When I learned that the CD was coming out, I jumped for joy. In fact, as I type this, I am listening to it. The songs on this CD are upbeat, yet operatic enough to still pass as a musical. Beautiful instramental work, combined with the two single most incredible voices on Broadway, who couldn't love it?<BR>     As Idina Menzel belts out  such powehouse song as Defying Gravity, and Kristin Chenowith sings her heart out in Thank Goodness, I feel their love for the roles, and the feeling of the play. Indeed, I still laugh every time Ms. Chenowith sings the upbeat Popular, and I can't help but start singing along with Ms. Menzel every time The Wizard and I comes on. <BR>My point? Buy this CD. I did.<BR>I couldn't be happier.
1577311760|1.0|I began listening to this book on tape with great anticipation due to the positive reviews it has received and the idea of learning to live more in the present.<br />I was turned off by the poor writing, subjectivity of the ideas, lack of fresh ideas, discarding of timeless scriptural doctrines in favor of doctrine based on the author's personal experiences and opinions (what sounds and feels good), and the repetition of thoughts over and over.<br />The author is appealing to what we know to be true--that to live in the present is the key to faith, joy and contentment, among other virtues.  He also knows that we would all like to believe that all paths lead to God, no matter what we call him/her, and we can all find him/her and the truth in ourselves and experience enlightenment by disciplining our thoughts.  It reminds me of the Celestine Prophecies, another book I found to be based on inane ideas and consisting of poor writing.  I think you will feel the same about this book as you did that one, which was also very popular.  Throw Deepak Chopra in the same group.  This book is similar to his \\"insights\\" on knowing God.<br />The audiotape is read by the author who just plain sounds goofy.<br />This book should land under the humor section.  Tolle's idea of enlightenment is nothing new.  He pales in comparison to scriptures, classic philosophy and literature and even to modern motivational writers like Zig Ziglar, Rober Schuller, Norman Vincent Peale, John Maxwell, Anthony Robbins, Robert Collier, Thomas Merton, Og Mandino, etc.  Their writing is head and shoulders above this drivel.  Keep this book in the context of centuries of spiritual writing that the author disparages based on his personal \\"enlightenment.\\"

B00000K19E|3.0|I must say that this movie has good graphics.Even though I'm not a big fan of Keanu Reeves, his acting was very orignal in this movie.

B00003CXSM|3.0|I really don't care for Jennifer Lopez.  I mean the women is an okay actress.  I don't think she makes great movies.  I honestly never liked a Jennifer Lopez movie (Other then Selena).  But this movie I liked.  I think she did pretty good in the movie.  It was a nice story line and the chemistry between her and Matthew was great.  I really enjoyed the film.  It was cute.
B00009TB5G|5.0|My first impression of The Two Towers was that while it was epic in scope and masterfully done, it was not quite as good as 2001's The Fellowship of the Ring. All the films are meant to be viewed as one, of course, but the first, and the third films in the trilogy are definitely on a higher level. <br />That much said, The Two Towers extended DVD edition definitely improves upon the film to the point where it now rivals it's predecessor and sequel both. Adding another 40 minutes to the movie, the extended cut is able to flesh out the characters even more deeply than the theatrical cut, and it is also able to deliver moments from the books which were not to be found in the original version. Some of the most noticeable enhancements are the enlargening of beautiful Miranda Otto's tragic role as Eowyn, and the addition of some new scenes of Merry and Pippin in Fangorn Forest (which helps to break up the awkward pacing of the original version of this subplot). We also learn Aragorn's age (he's over 80!), we see the Huorns appear at the battle of Helm's Deep (a fascinating little subplot from the books), and we get a sad glimpse of Boromir and his brother Faramir being split apart by their evil father in a flashback. The story goes much deeper in this version.<br />The battle sequences are given some new attention here, with extra footage subtly inserted into them, and also, there are some new scenes of Gollum (which are likely to be a fan favorite). I reccomend watching the film in two parts, due to it's nearly four-hour length, but if you can manage to sit through the entire film all at once, go for it! You won't be dissapointed. A great work of cinema has just got even better.

B000053V7O|5.0|This movie stars Dexter Gordon and features among others Herbie Hancock, Billy Higgins, John McGlaughlin, Wayne Shorter, Tony Williams, Freddie Hubbard and Ron Carter. If you like jazz that's probably all you need to know to make you go see it. <br />It's a loving recreation of Paris in the 1950s when many of the best American jazz musicians liked to hang in and around the Blue Note café, a venue which, if I only had a time machine is probably where I would most want to spend my evenings. There we find Dale Turner (Gordon) who is in France playing his tenor and drinking himself to death. Turner is based on a kind of amalgam of Bud Powell and Lester Young. His self-destructiveness and bizarre speech habits (all his male friends are nicknamed \\"Lady\\" something or other) are pureYoung. The friendship with a young Frenchman Francis (Francois Cluzet) with forms the film's dramatic centre is based on an episode in the life of Powell. <br />Cluzet's character is perhaps one of the weaker aspects of the film. His conversations with Turner are a bit unsuccessful in getting very far past fanspeak, You are so wonderful, I love your music so much, etc., etc., which I confess I started finding a little tiresome. But generally it's a really delightful movie and one it is possible to enjoy even if you aren't a jazz nut. <br />But the music is certainly a huge treat. The scene where Gordon and Lonette McKee's Darcey Leigh (clearly based on Billie Holiday) perform \\"How Long Has This Been Going On\\" is one of the most unforgettable and mesmerizing musical moments in any film. <br />Music aside, it's a rather quiet, low key drama about how Turner befriends Francis and his young daughter who must then struggle to help him control the drink habit which is inexorably killing him. It's fairly slow moving. Not a lot happens. But it's a touching and likeable movie, slow and tender like much of its soundtrack, and is kept interesting mainly by Dexter Gordon's marvellous performance as Turner,a heartbreaking mixture of poetry and kindness on the one hand and hopeless alcoholic desperation on the other. He acts almost as well as he plays and he plays, well, he plays like Dexter Gordon.
0767830555|4.0|The simple fact of this matter is the film makes no sense.  However, it is childishly compelling in its mystery and gloom and for a second every now and again, you might begin thinking this film really does have something along the lines of a theme, but then it falls from the tip of your tongue because something else is happening.
B00009XITP|4.0|I am normally not one for \\"chick flicks.\\"  My daughter had this movie and was watching it constantly on a recent boat trip, and darned if I didn't get hooked on it.  An impossibly cute Amanda Bynes plays a young American girl who is (unknown to her father) the daughter of a British Lord and politician (Colin Firth as the aptly-named Lord Dashwood is, well, dashing).  She impulsively flies to England to meet him, and therein lies a genuinely cute, funny, and touching story.  Maybe it is because I have a daughter of my own, but I found the chemistry between Bynes and Firth to be irresistable, and enough to overcome my usual antipathy to films of this genre.<br />At times the storyline is a bit \\"over the top\\" but even for a hard-boiled character like myself it holds the viewer's interest throughout.  Obviously this is a take-off on the \\"Cinderella\\" theme, complete with the Evil Stepsister, and the film acknowledges that in a humorous way that I won't spoil for you.  The sets are gorgeous, the supporting cast is pretty good, and overall there is a great deal about this movie to like.<br />My wife and daughter like these types of movies, and I am subjected to them on trips as a result.  In my opinion this one is far and away the best of the bunch, far better than \\"Princess Diaries.\\"

However, it now is in my &quot;Constant Play' pile and I am really glad I bought it!<br />A great CD to work to, too - the rhythm just keeps me going.

0345357116|5.0|I enjoyed reading each of Tolkien's first five books: The Hobbit, the Lord of the Rings, and the Silmarillion.  If this is true for you, and you especially need to like the Silmarillion (I have read reviews where people don't like the Silmarillion), then you will enjoy reading Unfinished Tales.  And like all of Tolkien's novels, I recommend buying it, because I believe you will want to read it more than once.  However, this novel is not like his previous novels, or even like the Silmarillion.  This is a collection of short stories and a publication of Tolkien's notes on some items of interest spanning from the Battle of Unnumbered Tears until the destruction of the Ring.  Included are stories on Tour, Turin, Numenor, Eorl, Gandalf, and Saruman.  I can say that reading Unfinished Tales has enriched the world of Middle Earth and I highly recommend it.
6305388458|5.0|....That isn't an early Mel Brooks or Richard Lester movie! This film pretty much made me a fan of the Pythons, leading me to go see a retrospective of theirs including \\"And Now For Something Completely Different\\", \\"Jabberwocky\\" and \\"Monty Python & The Holy Grail\\". By far the most ingenious and well written thing they've done since and maybe SLIGHTLY funnier than \\"Grail\\", this movie makes fun of zealotry, hypocrisy, decadence, dumb luck and history, all in one fell swoop!<br /><br />The movie generally involves a case of mistaken identity that affects a Nazarene named Brian, born on the same day as, and right downstream from, you-know-who. This mistake affects Brian's life through the course of the entire movie, even after he joins a fanatic sect of Roman-hating terrorists. Though the Wise Men who mistook him for Jesus early in the film corrected themselves, Brian still has a hard time convincing the sheepish, desperate people who follow him everywhere that he isn't a messiah while trying to escape Roman capture.<br /><br />Cleese, Idle and Palin especially shine in this film, playing many disparate parts...Cleese as 1) A Roman centurion, 2) Reg, the leader of a terrorist faction Brian happens onto, and 3) A high priest/Pharisee/Sadducee - whatever, holding a zany trial for someone who has said the Lord's name in vain; Idle as: 1) Stan, a terrorist with gender identity problems, 2) A crazy but extremely lucky guy who never gets crucified though he's due for it, 3) A guy who taunts a fellow at the sermon on the mount by repeatedly calling him \\"Bignose\\", 4) A stuttering gravedigger, 5) A stoning rock, false beard and gourd vendor and 6) The guy who sings \\"Always Look On The Bright Side Of Life\\" to Brian while hanging from a cross; Palin plays: 1) Pontius Pilate, 2) a particularly zealous member of the terrorist band Brian joins, 2)A squirrelly beggar complaining about being cured, 3) a VERY mild-mannered head counter at Brian's crucifiction, 4) The guy Idle taunts at the sermon on the mount and 5) A verbose false prophet. Even Chapman, the one playing Brian, also plays the role of Biggus Dickus, the lisping friend of Pontius Pilate as well as the hapless \\"Red Sea pedestrian\\" himself. Terry Jones plays Brian's mother and an ascetic who has his vow of silence ruined by Brian stepping on his foot.<br /><br />When I first saw this movie, I didn't remember laughing so much since seeing Richard Lester's \\"Help!\\" and \\"Hard Day's Night\\" at the Circle In The Square up in Greenwich Village back in 1967.

B00009V7PJ|5.0|The comparison of Cher and Madonna will go on forever.  But the facts are what count!  Madonna may be as successful as Cher musically (although hasn't been around long enough to see if she will keep having hits in the next two decades), but that is the only entertainment medium besides writing kids books (which anybody could write!) that she has succeeded in.  It is a known fact that she is the worst film actress in the world and no one can deny that.  She only received a Golden Globe for \\"Evita\\" because she sang the whole movie (no acting required!).  The caliber that Cher is in is unreachable for Madonna.  She has been around 20 years, made a lot movies, and if she hasn't done it by now - I don't see it happening.  Oprah even stated that Madonna always has a facade up and never truly shows who she really is and Cher has always been Cher.  The reason she has stayed on top for the past 40 years is because she hasn't cared what anyone else thinks about her!  Where through publicity stunts Madonna and the Britney Spear's of the world obviously do care what the world thinks about them and after American Life - Madonna better keep looking for new ways to get attention, because she needs it!
B0000CFW87|5.0|On \\"Closer,\\" Josh Groban's second album, the young singer had much more influence over the final product, including songwriting collaboration (Per Te, Remember When It Rains). His surprisingly quick rise to stardom was aided by multiple guest appearances on now-defunct Ally McBeal, several primetime interviews, and performing at the Winter Olympics. Far from a one hit wonder, Josh's talent continues to mature. \\"Closer,\\" like his eponymous debut, has managed to top the Billboard Charts. None too shabby for a 22-year old who's still a senior at his performing arts school (Josh also attended two summer sessions at the prestigious Interlochen Arts Camp in Michigan).<br />The thirteen tracks on \\"Closer\\" again showcase Josh's mature<br />tenor on the variety of songs he performs best: Italian film music (Mi Mancherai, from Il Postino, with musical guest Joshua Bell on violin), lush Italian ballads (All'Improvviso Amore, Caruso, Per Te), a Spanish ballad (Si volvieras a mi), a cover of an Edith Piaf classic (Hymne &agrave; l'amour), and a beautiful cover of Brian Kennedy's (with Secret Garden) \\"You Raise Me Up.\\"<br />There are markedly more English-language songs this time around, including a collaboration with the French Deep Forest (Never Let Go). Again produced with the help of legendary Canadian producer David Foster (Lara Fabian, Roch Voisine, C&eacute;line Dion, Michael Bubl&eacute;), the orchestrations enhance without overwhelming, creating a dreamy, romantically charged soundscape.<br />The limited edition features two exclusive songs, Mi Morena and She's Out Of My Life, along with a DVD featuring the EPK (Electronic Press Kit) and a behind-the-scenes look at Closer. Mi Morena is one of my favourite songs on the album, and the extra songs and bonus DVD pay for themselves. Josh fans will want to buy the limited edition (there is also an Internet edition with two exclusive songs, My December and You're The Only Place, available from Josh's official website).<br />A wonderful gift for anyone who appreciates classical crossover, a touch of romance, or for the Grobanites in your family who've been waiting impatiently for Josh's new album :-)anyone who appreciates classical crossover, a touch of romance, or for the Grobanites in your family who've been waiting impatiently for Josh's new album :-)

She's got such a unique voice, and it shows well on this album.<br />The better songs on the album are:<br />1. White Flag (a song of undying devotion) was the first single on this album released and it is very catchy and I love the lyrics.  <br />3. Life for Rent {an introspective look at a halted life) has very powerful lyrics, and it's a song most people will be able to relate to. &quot;...when I am so afraid to fail so I won't even try...&quot;<br />4. Mary's in india is a great song about a woman leaving her husband and how that the singer ends up with the husband and everything works out well.  The tune is beautiful, you will be humming it all day.<br />7. Who makes you feel is such a cool sounding song (ala SLIDE on No Angel) it's got a lot of interesting background stuff going, while showing off the pure quality of Didos voice.<br />8. Sand in my Shoe can be related to by anyone who wanted to get away from it all and then had to come back home after an enjoyable vacation.  It's got some romance in it too...must have been a summer fling thing.<br />The whole album is well done, but I didn't give it 5 stars because it's not quite as good as NO ANGEL.

0792164903|4.0|As he did with Batman and Planet of the Apes (and is reportedly doing with Charlie and the Chocolate Factory) Tim Burton has taken a classic story and placed his own unique stamp on it. The atmosphere and sets are classic Burton, especially the gnarled and nightmarish trees that surround and define an important part of the collective psyche of Sleepy Hollow.   <br />Johnny Depp (as Constable Ichabod Crane) displays his skill at portraying a character who is both humorous and earnest in this adaptation, applying Burton's concept of 19th century forensic equipment to the task of uncovering the origin of the mysterious circumstances that are causing people to lose their heads in the small village...literally. <br />For the most part, the supporting cast is also marvelous, from the voluptuous Christina Ricci to Miranda Richardson to Christopher Lee and Ian McDiarmid, just to name a few.  <br />The only person who seems miscast in this Burton fable is Christopher Walken as the Hessian Horseman.   Come on, Mr. Burton, just because you have given Walken pointy prosthetic teeth and the ability to ride his supernatural steed out of a gnarled old tree, are we supposed to be frightened?   The only thing frightening about Walken is his general lack of acting ability. Then again, Mr. Burton has always approached macabre subject matter with a dark sense of humor, so perhaps this casting is intended to be as tongue-in-cheek as the &quot;scientific instruments&quot; that Depp's Ichabod uses to practice his detective work. <br />If one went into the film not knowing that it was a Burton creation, one might come out of the film scratching one's head over the visual treatment of the story.  Since Burton has trained the viewer to expect a slightly exaggerated and off-beat style, however, the look and feel of the film should not come as a great surprise to anyone who is familiar with Burton's previous work.  In fact, for the most part, Burton shows great restraint in crafting most of the characters to be unusual, but not as over-the-top as, for example, his characters in Mars Attacks!<br />Best watched around Halloween, Sleepy Hollow is an entertaining ride through a &quot;nightmare&quot; with a distinctly Burton-esque feel.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|This was a GREAT television show!  If you have never watched an episode, or only saw a few back in 2002 when it was being broadcast, then you have missed out.  To truly appreciate the concept you have to watch the episodes as they are ordered on the DVD boxed set.  I have hooked more than 20 of my family and friends just by asking them to sit down and watch the pilot (none of these people consider themselves sci-fi or western fans).  Every time we have ended up in an extended binge session watching episode after episode.  This experience left them very entertained, but also irritated that the show was cancelled.  The writing is excellent and the acting is perfect so that by the time you finish the boxed set you have come to know and love these nine characters (ten if you count the ship Serenity) and you really want to learn more about how their stories play out.  The extras on the DVD, and there are a lot, provide many more hours of entertainment and there is tremendous replay value to the episodes.  But at the end of they day you just want to say, &quot;Gorram fox, I can't wait for the movie!!&quot;

Brooks' movies have traditionally been hit-or-miss, but like Blazing Saddles and History of the World Part I, Brooks has his subject matter dead in his satirical sights.<br />Rick Moranis makes a perfect Dark Helmet, a young Bill Pullman pulls of a sufficiently roguish \\"Lone Star,\\" and John Candy is well-suited as the Barf the Mawg.   Joan Rivers also does the voice for \\"Dot Matrix,\\" a robot who is vaguely reminiscent of another famous golden skinned druid.  Brooks himself makes hilarious appearances as General Scroob and Yogurt, and every sight gag seems to perfectly poke fun at the Holy Trilogy, from \\"combing the desert\\" to \\"ludicrous speed.\\"   The film also takes smaller, but nonetheless obvious jabs at other classic sci-fi, including the transforming \\"Mega-Maid,\\" obvious bows to \\"Planet of the Apes\\" and &quot;Alien,&quot; and a faulty transporter a-la Star Trek.<br />As usual, only Brooks could get away with producing a movie featuring a spoiled \\"Druish princess,\\" men fighting with light swords held in decidedly phallic positions, and jawa-like little people whose language consists of various inflections of \\"dink.\\" Brooks makes us revel in the sheer political incorrectness of it all, for we know that this is unabashed theater of the absurd.  <br />A hoot and a half from start to finish, this inexpensive DVD should be part of the collection of anyone who enjoys good science fiction or extremely silly but high quality spoof comedy.
B00005JMEW|4.0|No other film of 2003 celebrated the pure joy of filmmaking with more mindless gusto than Tarantino's genre hopping, balls-to-the-wall, go-go bloodbath. Kill Bill Vol I is a big, gaudy shrine to style over substance - the cinematic equivalent of graffiti, loud, colorful & highly stylized. The film opens with a bang and doesn't stop for a breath, culminating with The House of Blue Leaves sequence - a stunning piece of action filmmaking and one that will be hard to top. I hope Vol II lives up to the very high expectation set by Vol I, but even if it doesn't, at least Tarantino has given us a nice little taste of superficial, spaghetti Western, blaxploitation, samurai, kung-fu eye candy. Sure, it's hollow but so are Faberge eggs. If you're looking for a meditation on the human condition, look elsewhere. But if want to see a filmmaker practice a masterful exercise in visual stimulation, Kill Bill Vol I is definitely for you.
B00000F1D3|5.0|CHER is the bomb. How many incarnations is she going to have? This album defines late '90s for me. I first heard \\"Believe\\" in a bar waay before it was released and immediatley knew it would be a huge hit. It's hard to believe that she hasn't had a top 40 hit since. But her gay fans probably don't realize that because her songs have been playing in bars non-stop. It cracks me up how the dance floor can be empty but when a CHER song comes on people rush to the floor like fat woman rushes to a piece of cake! Sorry if that analogy is pretty ignorant, but I just had to find the words to describe how fast the dance floor fills up.
B000001ABD|5.0|Stevie is the best.Plain and simple.If you love get the At The Close Of A Century Disc set. If you like him so-so get The Definitive Collection.Or if you dont know him that well get Songs in the Key of Life which has all the hits but not as many as the other two.
B000002KBU|5.0|Face it, if you have heard her there is no gray area. This has got to be the definitive Joni album. Cary, A Case of You, The Last Time I Saw Richard...all classics. The Last Time I Saw Richard is the best though. Just simple piano, lyrics that actually place you at the &quot;cafe&quot; where Joni and Richard are meeting. Stunning. A Case of You follow close behind. I love the lyric, &quot;I could drink a case of you..and still be on my feet&quot;. I have tried so many times to get people to love her like I do by playing this song. Hasn't worked. I think people are turned off by the pitch of her voice. Also..why was this song included on her &quot;Misses&quot; album rather than the &quot;Hits&quot;? &quot;This Flight Tonight&quot; is another of my faves on this album. I love the guitar in this song. I wonder if Joni is afraid of flying for real? I heard &quot;River&quot; on the local NPR radio staion on Christmas Eve..I had forgotten how affecting and sad this song is. Another great version of this song is on the Indigo Girls 2 disc live cd. They introduce it by calling it the saddest Christmas song ever. How true. &quot;All I Want&quot; opens the album on a high note. I can't say enough about this album. If you've never heard her music I hope this review will make you decide to check it out. Also &quot;Court and Spark&quot; is another great one to get!
B000003TA4|5.0|After 12 years this cd without adoubt one of the best, even without Kurt Cobain here he lives on through Nirvana's music. I only have one thing to say if you dont have it BUY IT.<BR>Everytrack on this cd comes ripping from you cd player hitting you in the face with hard guitar riffs, buy it you will love it.
B00006RJHG|5.0|BLACK CHRISTMAS is one of the best of the horror genre and HALLOWEEN, although a great film itself, borrows much from this film - John Carpenter was friends with Bob Clark and even had asked Clark if he was going to do a sequel. Bob Clark, director of the excellent CHILDREN SHOULDN'T PLAY WITH DEAD THINGS and DEATHDREAM, told Carpenter that he was not going to do a sequel, but, if he was, it would be called HALLOWEEN. Carpenter's opening is very similar in style to Clark's opening, as if the killer POV camera work and the killer lurking out of the frame. Olivia Hussey is not the virginal heroine (her character is pregnant and determined to abort the baby) and a lot of film books and reviews incorrectly identify Keir Dullea as the killer when he is obviously not. I have heard complaints regarding the ending and the unknown identity of the killer because most viewers have been conditioned to have everything explained to them &amp; tied up in a neat little package, a la the ending of PSYCHO, but that only makes the film more unique. It was one of the first and the acting is superb for this type of effort. In a fair world it would be every bit as popular as HALLOWEEN, but given the amount of posts for this film, it shows that BLACK CHRISTMAS is very much appreciated by horror fans. I read an interview with Bob Clark on FANGORIA'S web site that a remake of BLACK CHRISTMAS is in the works, as well as a remake of DEATHDREAM and either a remake or sequel to CHILDREN SHOULDN'T PLAY WITH DEAD THINGS. Another great Bob Clark film worth checking out is MURDER BY DECREE, in which Sherlock Holmes takes on the Jack the Ripper slayings. It's a shame that Clark turned his back on the horror genre after BLACK CHRISTMAS and directed crap like the PORKY'S movies and LOOSE CANNONS. If he would have kept his hand at horror, I predict that he would have been one of the biggest names in the field today.
0394810112|5.0|*** A Purist's Review ***<br />Joseph Schindelman's illustrations are to Roald Dahl's text like Peanut Butter is to Jelly.<br />Charlie and the Chocolate Factory is one of those exciting and unexpected reading experiences that makes an impression when you are young and then years later comes to mind when choosing books for your own children.  It is an exploration into a whimsical universe but yet grounded in a real and recognizable Victorian place... Nice for those who have not yet acquired a taste for complicated science fiction and fantasy.  <br />My favorite part of the book was the characterizations of the children and their families and a critical part of my enjoyment was the hilarious and classical Joseph Schindelman illustrations.  His pictures are truly inspired and cleverly silly... and appear to so accurately portray the essence of each character and scene... as though he knew exactly what Roald Dahl meant - even though this is a fantasy that could have many different visual interpretations. They captured my imagination and added immeasureably to the fun of the story.  As a child I had absolutely no desire to see the Gene Wilder movie because the illustrations were so integral to the story in my mind. They remind me of the illustrations in the \\"Le Petit Nicholas\\" series (illustrated by Jean Jacque Sempe). . .which are so expressive and cute and elegantly done that they don't even need to be in color. <br />The new edition illustrations are so disappointing in comparison.  It's really too bad that the new generation of young readers will be eating peanut butter and jelly sandwiches with no peanut butter. I will instead look for a used copy of the older edition to give as a gift because introducing this wonderful book to a young child without those original illustrations would not be doing it justice.
B00008J4P5|1.0|I feel sorry for some of you too young to know what real music is. But let's get real. No one is going to be listening to this dreck in two years, let alone seriously consider Elephant as one of the best rock albums of all time. I was willing to give this incestuous?/formerly married duo half a chance following such glowing reviews and hype, but after hearing this album was convinced the world who subscribed to the alleged \\"genius\\" of this band was absolutely insane. Either that, or they simply don't even know what they're missing.<br />Can we honestly say that this band, who BARELY knows their chops, who conveniently chalks up this waste-of-our-time concept piece, while they seemingly call tuning up and thrashing -- badly -- out of rhythm, their \\"art\\", worthy of such praise? <br />Their subliminal sound, post punk flavorings, aren't new. And are far from original. <br />If you want to hear some musicians who know how to make effective pounding beats, and sneering vocals, plus tasty guitar licks, revisit or get to know the Sex Pistols, the Clash, and the Ramones, and the Cars (especially), who had enough respect for a little thang called MUSIC to learn a thing or two about it and to keep learning.    <br />C'mon, people! This is a novelty act. Anyone who makes really bad music they can barely play and makes the whole deal hip by insisting that the utter mediocreville you're buying is art, is just trying to steal your wallet. <br />Do yourself a great favor and listen to these five following disks and then put on Elephant and tell me if it rates anywhere near these albums, albums which deserve to be in the pantheon of greatness: <br />1. Never Mind the Bollocks, here's the Sex Pistols<BR>2. The Ramones: The Ramones<BR>3. The Clash: London Calling<BR>4. The Ramones: Road to Ruin<BR>5. The Cars: The Cars
0380789035|3.0|If there were half stars, I would have given this book a 2.5.  Instead I gave it a 3, because it truely doesn't deserve a 2.  While Neil Gaiman is one of my favorite authors, and one of the few &quot;modern&quot; authors I find captivating, this book was lacking something.  How easily you can surmise numerous plot points long before you would wish to discover them, and when this leads to definite feelings of disappointment in the predictability of it all.<br />There are also so many characters and points that feel too shallow.  You are introduced to them for a page or two and then they completely disappear from the story, or they reaper again for a few more pages and still seem just as pointless to the plot.  It makes the book feel like it should have been:  A) Longer or B) a series instead of one book.  I believe that if the story had been explored in more depth it would have added more relevance and intrigue, and allowed things to unfold in a much less predictable manner.  Many parts felt rushed and cramped, as if a certain idea felt crucial when it came about but adding it then lead to another, more important, plot point being cut too short.<br />The ideas in the book are wonderful, and the main character has a wonderful skeleton.  Yet as a whole I didn't find it as captivating as Gaiman's novel &quot;Neverwhere&quot; or as the one he coauthored with Terry Pratchet &quot;Good Omens...&quot;. So I have to say it was an enjoyable read, but disappointing.
B000066NW0|3.0|This is the scoop on Avril Lavigne: she has,  I must admit, a good voice.  And, her songs really are good. All this is good.  But she has, let me tell you, one of the largest image problems of any singer, ever. That's right, EVER.  She is a poser, and she was set up by a marketing company to make moolah. In fact, Avril, before she was delegated as a punk singer, sung country. yes, country. although she has been quoted as saying that country wasn't really her style, her voice would be very suited to it. As it is, though, she's singing soft rock. (No, she is not a punk. i'd like to clear that up so that no one runs after me with their electric guitar screaming).<br />However, be that as it may, the result is dang good.   While the CD, was, as stated in the iTunes review, very, very, over produced, it is still very good. <br />My advice:  While, yes, you can- and should- listen to this stuff, you should not, under any circumstances, pay $18 (or euros or pounds or whatever) to fund a bunch of hot-shot marketing executives who gave avril a fake identity (i.e. punk anti-britney) so that they can spend money for the heck of it. as far as i am concerned, they can live in a medium sized house, not wear prada suits, and drink generic soda like the rest of us.  So a) get this off KaAzA b) have a friend burn if for you c)download it while still paying for it, or d) split the CD halvsies with a friend.<br />However, that's me. Liking or not liking avril is a personal image/voice preference.  While i compromise, you may not. But please, do not run away saying that a) Avril is a real punk, and b) Avril has a bad voice. <br />P.S.--  If i had to recommend one song out of the CD, i'd nominate &quot;i'm with you&quot;. with very heartfelt lyrics that most people can relate to, and searing vocals that emphasize her voice, this is by far hte best track. Actually, i first read the lyrics when i was reading fan fiction-- Hermione singing kareoke. D+Hr. ooohh... all the more reason to like it.
0441003257|5.0|This is the most uplifting, fun, and recommendable to almost anyone book that I have read in ages.  I finished it in 36 hours that were only interrupted by work.  I couldn't bring myself to sleep I was to captivated.  I found myself laughing out loud while sitting by myself in a coffee shop only to look up and see two older women staring at me as if I were crazed.  I can honestly say that I was surprised by almost everything that happened in this book, and that it was so dissapointing when I finished the last page.  I immediatly went and patronized one of my good friends into reading it the next day, and she finished almost as quickly as I did.  It has been a few months, and we still make jokes to each other about the book.  I am actually quite distraught I have been unable to convince any of my other friends to read it yet.  I am now done rambling on like a 12 year old girl with a crush, my final words being:  Please, read this book.
B000084T18|2.0|This CD is simply a symbol of what modern hip-hop is. It's got excellent beats, and if all you do is blare your system, with nothing but bass in your car (highs, who the hell needs highs? Bass is EVERYTHING) then this is a good CD to get. If your an actual rap fan, who enjoys hearing a man or group spit excellent rhymes and excellent lyrics, then go elsewhere. Eminem is an example of an artist who knows how to piece words together, an ARTIST. Not a clown. 50 Cent belongs in a category with Ying Yang Twins, Lil Jon and the Eastside Boyz and Chingy...not with Eminem, Jay-Z, Nas, BIG, 2Pac, or Outkast. For those of you thinking those of us with lower reviews are &quot;hataz&quot; please open your eyes. This CD is just horrible rap with excellent beats. If all you listen to is beats then go ahead and pick this up, if you enjoy excellent lyrical content, pick up Eminem Show, anything from Outkast, Black Album...anything but this. This is garbage. But its ok though...because he's been shot 9 times.
B0001GOH6Q|4.0|BIG FISH is a film about living a life full of worth. It's about the stories that surround us. Living a life of wonder and fascination should not stop when we leave childhood through the harrowing door of puberty. We should always live our lives with a childlike faith, always curious, always wanting to explore. BIG FISH is also a film that raises some interesting questions. What is real? Where does one separate the fact from the fiction? Or, perhaps the things that seem most fantastical are actually the things most real and true.<br /><br />The movie briefly tells the story of one Edward Bloom, a life-long storyteller who finds himself on his deathbed suffering from a debilitating disease after living a very full life. Bloom's only child is a newspaper reporter who has grown tired of his father's tall tales. After years of not speaking with his father and staying away from home, he returns home after he learns of his father's impending death. The son comes home to confront his Dad but is forced to rethink his own beliefs about what makes a fact and what is truly real.<br /><br />Ewan McGregor plays the younger version of Bloom and his performance is what holds the film together as it weaves from the past to the present and from fantasy and reality. Also, Danny DeVito makes an impressive turn in an interesting supporting role as a circus ringmaster with a strange disease.<br /><br />The movie was directed by Tim Burton and it's nice to see Burton getting back to movies he enjoys making. Tim Burton is the only director in Hollywood who can effectively tell a story through images without much of a (or even any) screenplay.<br /><br />Overall, BIG FISH is a fun film to watch. It's full of beautiful subtleties. It has a good message and though is fantastical, seems more down-to-Earth than many of Burton's other pictures (e.g. EDWARD SCISSORHANDS). The film is a decent family movie though younger children probably won't enjoy it as much as older ones.
B00009V7PJ|5.0|I could not have said it better.  The comparison between Madonna and Cher continues because there are so many Madonna lovers who are jealous of Cher's overshadowing of their queen.  I absolutely agree that Madonna may be big--but she can not (at this point in her career) ever reach the level of success that Cher has had.  The only reason Madonna did so well in \\"Evita\\", is because \\"Evita\\" was basically a two-hour music video (not a major stretch for Madonna).  Naturally, she did well--but could anyone see Madonna in any role that Cher has played in the past?  Not hardly.  And as for Madonna's children's books?  Please.  Let's not go down that road.<br />Actually, I DO like Madonna.  But, I am growing tired of her superficial and hypocritcal antics.  Cher is just plain Cher--always is, always was, and always will be.  On the other hand, Madonna changes her persona with every new album.  Who knows \\"who\\" Madonna really is?  It would be nice to know that there is a REAL person under all of that attitude and narcissism.  However, even though I am a fan of Madonna, I am not so blind as to be unable to see through her.  The same thing cannot be said for most of her fans.<br />Until then, my advice to Madonna (and to Madonna fans), is to watch Cher, listen to Cher, and LEARN!
B00005JMTN|5.0|Keep that in mind as you watch \\"Big Fish,\\" for the fact and the fiction come together in a cohesive whole to paint a picture of the eccentric Edward Bloom in this touching, fanciful story of a father who tells tall tales and the son trying to make sense of them.  Considering the films' sweetness, warm nature and uplifting story, is surprised to learn that Tim Burton was on hand to direct.  Burton, now in his fourties, is a perpetual Hollywood outsider, often telling stories of sympathetic oddballs and socital outcasts, which come through in films like his \\"Edward Scissorhands\\" and even his take on Batman, which paint Bruce Wayne has a lonely, bachelor billionaire saving society while not taking full part in it either.  But in \\"Big Fish,\\" Burton shows his emotional range, reportedly taking the project after the death of his own father.<br />The film opens as Edward Bloom (a terrific Albert Finney and Ewan McGregor) and his son Will (Billy Crudup) are estranged due to Edwards' unbelievable stories about his life, which Will has grown tired of.  But, with Edward on his death bed, Will goes to his side, to try and learn the truth to why his father tells these tales.  Through various stroytellers and listeners, we learn Edwards' remarkable life story:  meeting witches, giants, werewolves, swampy utopias, his romantic hook up with his wife (Allison Loman and Jessica Lange), his fighting in Korea and saving that same Utopia he had visited earlier in his life.  This web of stories are expertly woven by, not only Burton, but also screenwriter John August (\\"Go\\") who fill the story, not only with idyllic images of Americana and plenty of good-natured humor, but with an emotional core that one cannot help but connect with.<br />And that core is done justice by an excellent acting ensemble, led by the lovable Albert Finney as the aging Bloom an Ewan McGregor and the younger.  Their performances perfectly match, weaving a character as fanciful as his stories but also as real as his disease.  Look for Finney to take home an Oscar for his work.  Billy Crudup is wonderful as well as the doubting Will, who softens throughout the film, leading to a tear-jerker scene in which, by telling his own story, Will shows he understands his father.   Juicy turns are on hand all around, as Steve Buscemi plays a poet turned bank robber, Danny De-Vito as a werewolf carnival manager and Helena Bonham Carter as a scret admirer of Edward and his tales.  One of the surprise best of the year, \\"Big Fish\\" will leave you believing in those tall tales again, and Tim Burton's filmmaking abilities.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|When it was first aired, I stumbled across an episode of Firefly. Within seconds I was mesmerized. I kept wondering, &quot;What is this show? Why have I never heard of it?&quot; Since then, I've seen every episode on the DVD set at least twice. They're phenomenal. They feel more like short movies than t.v. episodes. They stand up to many viewings. Every time I watch, I notice something clever that I hadn't seen before. The DVDs are a wonderful way to have these shows at my fingertips. The commentaries are funny and enlightening. The special features are a delight. What a bargain!
B0000AMRJC|5.0|This movie truly symbolizes the &quot;struggle&quot; as it is so often put. While some believe that this movie glorifies the &quot;gangster&quot; lifestyle, I for one believe this is simply a wonderful insight into the rise and fall of a man hungry for power and wealth. Although Montana sold and used drugs and was a very ruthless killer, he was also a victim in a way. He simply wanted the &quot;better&quot; things in life and given his background he saw only one way for him to do it and this thirst for power and money engulfed his very being and eventually led to his downfall.<br /> I recommend the anniversary edition to everyone but it isn't a must have. Only the movie itself is. The rappers giving their take on the movie was a very nice touch but i thought that there could have been other individuals featured who could have had just as good insight into the movie just from a differnt perspective. All in all this movie is a must watch for any one who loves movies, not just for &quot;gangster's&quot;.
B000004166|5.0|Grumiaux's Mozart is clean and clear.  I believe his implementation follows the closest to that intended by Mozart and accurately reflects the style of the Classical period.  Unlike some other renditions, Grumiaux does not indulge in overblown vibratos, exaggerated trills, or drawn-out endings.  Instead, his tempo is crisp, his tone is clear, and he stays within the boundary of classical interpretation.  One can imagine that this is how Mozart was played back in the courts and concert halls of Europe in the 18th century.  Highly recommended and a bargain with the double CDs.  If you want to stay true to how Mozart intended his design, then get Grumiaux's rendition, you won't be disappointed.
B0000DZEA1|5.0|Howard Shore has done an amazing thing: composing and orchrestrating three separate soundtracks that not only stand alone by themselves, but that can be played together as one seamless whole.  Peter Jackson did it with the movies, but Shore's job was more difficult because he wasn't scoring all three films simultaneously. Anyway, there are some familiar refrains from FELLOWSHIP and TWO TOWERS on this album. However, there are several differences. The major new instrumental piece is &quot;Minas Tirith&quot;. Also new to this album are vocals from the movie sung by the actors in the film:  Billy Boyd on &quot;The Steward of Gondor&quot; and Viggo Mortensen on &quot;The Return of the King&quot;.  The final song on the album, Annie Lennox' &quot;Into the West&quot; seems like a pop ballad, but contains enough depth and nuance to end this magnificent piece of movie music.

B00006BTCA|1.0|Interpol, like many other bands riding the Post Punk/80's rock scene wave lack clarity and vision. And while their influences are interesting, essentially their music goes no further than the sounds of those earlier ground breaking bands. Joy Division ceased to exist over 20 years ago and unfortunately the only facet Interpol has chosen to resurrect from JD and alike bands is the melodrama; which does not alone make for good music. If you are going to spend your hard earned cash, invest it in music that strives toward originality and innovation regardless of when it was created, be it 1979 or 2003
B0000DZEA1|4.0|I was delighted to find out that the voice I had liked to much when I saw the movie was Rene Fleming's. Thought it sounded familiar! She makes a great job, and I wish they had gotten her to sing Into The West. Annie Lennox is so disappointing and out of place... She sounds crowish after hearing Fleming's voice. <BR>Billy Boyd does a very moving job, and there's the CD's other fault: the lyrics of Pippin's song are not given, and it's a real shame.
B00003XACV|5.0|Musician Frank Zappa is credited with saying that &quot;Writing about music is like dancing about architecture.&quot; In other words, trying to express the feelings music can convey in words is a pointless (perhaps ridiculous) exercise. While Zappa's words are not always true -- much modern music is simplistic and trite enough that writing about it is actually quite easy -- Thomas Newman's music for the score of &quot;American Beauty&quot; certainly proves Zappa's point.<br />Newman's score for &quot;American Beauty,&quot; simply put, is indescribably beautiful, highly original and completely unexpected. It's difficult, to say the least, to put into words what makes it so.<br />In some ways, the music is characteristic of Newman's excellent body of work. Some of the pieces are carried by a simple, quiet piano theme, while others make complex use of modern, ambient sound. For many films, this mixture of styles would sound disjointed and confused, but Newman makes it all work brilliantly and elegantly. This combination makes the music stand out as Newman's most original and most skilled work.<br />The music is filled with subtle emotion that sneaks up on the listener. Just as the film does, it encourages the listener to &quot;look closer,&quot; to go beyond the catchy upbeat tones of the early music and open oneself up to the deeper, more complex themes. And, just as in the film, taking a closer look is an eminently rewarding experience. The more one listens to this music, the better it gets.<br />Frank Zappa was right in this case: these words are definitely inadequate to get the feeling of the music across. I hope that they have at least convinced you to try it for yourself. It is music that is certainly worth that closer look, and as its name suggests, it represents beauty itself.
B0000TB01Y|5.0|Today I went with on a school trip to see this show, and let me tell you, you haven't lived until you have seen this show! It is absolutely incredible and I am so happy that I was fortunate enough to see it. You will enjoy this cd alot, because the songs are so meaningful, fun, and beautiful all on the same cd. I hope I helped you in choosing whether or not you will buy this cd, and I hope that you choose to buy it, because I am sure that you will love it as much as my whole school group did! ~Amazing show!
B000002UAX|3.0|Emerging from the orchestra backed, over produced 1964/67 years that resulted in Rubber Soul, Revolver and Sgt. Pepper, the Beatles moved back toward their rock roots with this one.  The opening track - Back in the USSR - is a testament to that.<br />Unfortunately, there are a number of subpar songs to get through, but there are 12-13 songs that would have comprised a nice album by themselves.
B0000CDLA7|5.0|It's too bad there are a lot of not so positive reviews of this album from what I have read, because it is absolutely phenomenal. A band like Dream Theater does not deserve any criticism. From the opening of \\"As I Am\\" this album grabs you and doesn't let you go until the ending chords of \\"In The Name of God\\". The album is quite a bit more straight-forward but in a good way and DT's fantastic musicianship is still very much evident, but here it is almost in the background and you just get to \\"rock out\\" with the band. There are some great influences that can be detected here, such as classic Metallica, and even The Beatles in the instrumental \\"Stream of Consciousness\\"! \\"As I Am\\" is such an awesome song, it truly deserves radio airplay and this song should have put DT on the musical map! \\"This Dying Soul\\" is such a heavy track also, you have to listen to it to believe it. The bottom line is that every track is strong and DT once again pushes the envelope and challenges themselves by creating something different from previous albums. Again it is more straight-forward, although still very complicated by any persons standards. It will definately take several listens to digest everything but there are some great moments to be found again just like any DT album. They are simply the best band out there, this album just helps to solidify their place as the true kings of Progressive Hard Rocking Music! Just have an open mind and you will enjoy the album immensely!
B000002UB6|4.0|This wonderfully produced vintage 1970 original is the &quot;Let It Be&quot; on which to focus.  Spector did an awesome job - according to both Lennon and Harrison - driving this project to completion.<br />Although it may not have been to the Beatle's bass guitarist' liking, the 2003 re-issue, absent the great &quot;Let It Be&quot; guitar solo is enough to convince me that musicians should stay out of the producer's seat.  Sorry Mac, it's true.

B00006BTCA|1.0|What exactly do people like about this disc? Usually, when an act reaches the level of acclaim Interpol has, there is at least something likable about them. I can't find a single thing to recommend about this disc. Wake up people...the lyrics not only are pretentious and cumbersome...but they are also meaningless. The music is uninspired and dull. The performances sound forced (especially that whole &quot;Stella I love you&quot; bit...ugh). People are going to have to travel to sell this sucker once they wake up and realize it's not Joy Division they're listening to. Let's hope it happens soon, because I am going to lash out next time somebody tries to pass off this overwrought tripe as something worth listening to.
B00004XONN|5.0|when i first heard this album i was blown away. every song on this cd is stunning, i like the national anthem a lot. same with morning bell. radiohead's best.
B000003TAR|5.0|obviously, this is the last studio album before kurt died, so everyone makes a great deal of hype about it. but even if he were still alive, this'd be one of thier best, soley for the fact that they wanted to get away from music&quot;everyone liked&quot; and back to thier indie ideals and raw power. Kurt didn't use that small clone chorus box that was present throughout nevermind, which was probably a good idea. but this album's good on all sides, its got raw, ruthless power and quieter, but not in the least less affective, ones too. i'd give it nine stars if possible , because theres only a handful of studio or live albums that represent the artist from all sides as weel as this one. rock on.
B00008J4P5|5.0|I've been reading all these negative reviews about this album, and I think to myself, what's not to like about this amazing album? Everything is great about it. Don't listen to these other review's the White Stripes are one of the best bands in the world, and this album proves it once again.
B00006BTCA|1.0|In my opinion, Interpol isn't good. I don't like their music. I'm glad I only listened to it and didn't buy.<BR>My opinion is absolutely and completely valid, as is anyone else's. I kinda like the Post-Punk style but prefer American Hardcore. I'm well aware that Interpol isn't trying to play Hardcore, but I have some friends who recommended them as an enjoyable alternative. I was open-minded enough to give them a try. Their music has a little life in it, but not enough to get my blood flowing. Actually it's kinda boring.<BR>1 Star reviewer's have as much right to dislike Interpol and give their negative opinions as anyone who likes them and gives their own positive opinions.
0316666343|5.0|This novel is one of the best novels i had ever read! It start out with a very interesting and exciting introduction that kept me glue to the story. Inside the book it showed me lessons about love life and death. The plot was about a 14 years old girl being raped and killed very close to her house by a murder no one suspected. The girl was actually the narrator, which made the story became so interesting since we already know what really did happened. I love the way Sebold mentioned every characters in the novel that made the readers able to undertand their personalities and attitudes and how different members of the family react differently to her death. It was a new experience for me to read a book concerning death, but it had gave me a very good impression that made me want to read other books similiar to this. In this novel it made me nervous, excited, happy, and so sad that it made me cry.
0613222407|4.0|Rainbow Six is one of the best books I have read in a long time. This was my first book by Clancy, and I have already bought more of his books. Clancy captures the current situations in the book and explains, sometimes in gruesome detail, how it was handled by the new CT team made up of American, British, Israeli, and German troops. Rainbow Six is a must read.
B00006BTCA|1.0|Ok, I just borrowed this CD from a friend that has been raving about Interpol for awhile. So, I listened to it a few times to give it a fair shake. What I just can't shake though is the impression that the lead singer of Interpol is trying so hard to sound like Ian Curtis from Joy Division or Peter Murphy from Bauhaus. I mean, if I had never heard either of these bands, I probably would have been pretty impressed and thought they were one of the best bands I have heard in quite sometime. But, the sad reality of it, is that I grew up listening to bands like Siouxsie and the Banshees, the Cure, Bauhaus, and Joy Division. Why do I need a new band that is trying to do what they did and not even do it much better? <BR>If you support this kind of music, then what incentives does it give to new artists to do what artists are supposed to do - be creative? Sorry, but any band with the talent level that Interpol has (and looks) can listen to Joy Division day and night and then rip them off. This is the same tactic that Creed did on Pearl Jam and they succeeded in pulling it off for a certain segment of the population. I, however, thought the indie crowd was more sensible than that. But this new breed of NYC retro bands like the Strokes and such are almost as bad. <BR>What we need are more fresh innovative bands like Radiohead, Tool, Primus, Pavement, and Queens of the Stone Age that dare to be themselves instead of carbon copies of something that has already been done. As much as I try to say, &quot;ah, just don't think about it and try to enjoy it&quot;, it's hard to dismiss the lack of originality, genuineness, and courage to do something new. If all bands were like Interpol and the Strokes, music would never evolve and never be daring. How boring would that be? <BR>The hype machine can enjoy Interpol while the hype lasts. I'll just throw my Siouxsie CDs in and listen to the real thing. I'd rather not support Joy Division tribute bands that try to conceal that they are anything but that. <BR>Music needs to progress, otherwise, stagnation will set in. What is so hard about being yourself?
0060090367|4.0|After reading a short story by Marian Keyes, I decided to try reading one of her novels.  Watermelon is the story of Claire Walsh, an Irish woman in her early 30s who has just given birth to her first child.  When she wakes up after the delivery, the first thing she sees is her husband, James, who informs her that he is leaving her for their downstairs neighbor.  In a state of shock, Claire packs some things and leaves London with her yet unnamed baby girl to travel back home to her parents in Ireland.<br />What follows is the familiar tale of a woman struggling to get back on her feet; Claire predictably goes through the process of depression to redemption.  Despite the common nature of the storyline, Keyes has created engaging characters in Claire, her neurotic parents, and her two youngest sisters--Helen with her biting sarcasm, and Anna, the lovable airhead.  Even when the plot becomes somewhat contrived and unrealistic, Keyes injects humor and life into Claire's story; the reader can't help but to be interested in how things turn out.<br />Keyes has written two more novels about the five Walsh sisters:  Rachel's Holiday, which tells the story of middle child Rachel, and her more recent work, Angels, which focuses on second oldest Margaret.  Although these books weren't quite up to the quality of Watermelon, once you begin reading about the Walsh sisters, you may become as hooked as I did.
B00006BTCA|1.0|OH MY GOSH THIS STINKS!!! <BR>Turn on the bright lights must be a hint from the band for us all to open our eyes and see that we've all been taken as suckers. They're laughing all the way to the bank with their handfuls of pennies from all the CD's they've been selling to fools like me. I was so excited when I heard that there was this great new band out there slowly gaining in popularity. Not a quick one hit wonder but supposedly a group with a real unique twist on all the 'THE' bands that have been assaulting our poor helpless ears with unimaginative drivel for the past few years. So I've been getting recommendation after recommendation and finally went out and grabbed the CD for myself. You see I hadn't really heard anything by them except a few song intro's and endings as I'm not really a radio listener or watch TV. <BR>I've been a huge music fan and collector for the 25 years since I was finally came out from under the musical taste of my older siblings in the late 70's and though it's been difficult to not turn into a grumpy older guy hating anything that's come out in the past 10 years I really see no justification for anything but to hate all these new bands. So to get back to Interpol I thought I'd found the inspiration to keep me going, to keep my mind open to the possibilities of the unknown, to the very hope that the youth of the new millennium had finally developed taste and had stopped ripping off everything that had come before them. It is after all, within the limits of rock and roll, extraordinarily difficult to actually come up with something new. There's only so far you can go with a singer who can't sing, a guitarist who knows 1-2 chords, a drummer that can barely keep time and a bassist that falls asleep form being bored with playing the bass. So where was I? Oh yeah, is there anyone out there making decent music??? <BR>Interpol clearly are not. You've read the other reviews and you've heard the comparisons. And for those of you who think they're great, I say that's wonderful. Ignorance is bliss isn't it? Luckily you don't mean anything by your ignorance so I can ignore you and move on with my life. For those of you who have heard Interpol and hear nothing but bits and pieces of Post-Punk bands you know where I'm coming from. It's obvious the members of this band have fantastic taste. Come on and admit it. You're comparing them to JOY DIVISION, ECHO &amp; THE BUNNEYMEN, PSYCHEDELIC FURS, KITCHENS OF DISTINCTION, etc. Wow, those are a great list of bands to be compared to. Heck I'd be grinning from ear to ear if I could make music that would remind people of those groups. BUT... is the reminder based on praise for the similarity or distain for the lack of substance behind the similarity? Personally I can't find the substance to support these guys, Hopefully with some maturity and a lessening of desire to sound like so and so the Sophmore release by Interpol will stand on it's own and fulfill my dreams for the youth of America. Of course by that time the Brits will most likely have put out some really fantastic music and when Interpol V2 comes out they'll be long forgotten. Oh well it could be worse. They could be wallowing in absolute obscurity, but in the end they did get my 15 bucks.<BR>P.T. Barnum's great quote applies here. THERE'S A SUCKER BORN EVERY MINUTE.
B00008RWRH|5.0|With this 5-disc DG &quot;Collectors Edition&quot; boxed set, Eugen Jochum's incredible early-70s performances of Haydn's 12 &quot;London&quot; Symphonies make a welcome return to the catalog.  While I will always treasure the recordings I grew up on (Szell's &quot;90s&quot; Symphonies and Bernstein's &quot;100s&quot;), Jochum's accounts are as good as any currently available, including the celebrated ones by Davis and Dorati.  Even serious collectors who own the initial CD release of these works will have to take a second look at this new set because of what is contained on its 5th Disc.  It features three symphonies -- No. 91 with the Bavarian RSO from 1958, and Nos. 88 &amp; 98 with the Berlin Philharmonic from 1961 &amp; '62 respectively -- which have never been previously available on CD.  They were enough for me to spring for an upgrade, and I am really glad I did!
B00005JL1C|4.0|Very cute movie by eighties teen film master, John Hughes, has a young Eric Stoltz as the poor kid trying to land a date with Lea Thompson, playing the rich girl, even though Mary Stuart Masterson, Stoltz's tomboy best friend, is really in love with him. I really liked this one, I can't imagine why it's the only one of Hughe's teen flicks that never got alot of attention considering it's up there with Ferris Bueller and Sweet Sixteen. Perhaps cinema audiences were getting tired of the formula at the time but in retrospect it's a sweet, funny little drama with the goofy late-Eighties settings and costumes we all know and love.
B000002JSJ|4.0|I did like this album, considering my 4 star rating, but it's the first album of theirs I would risk calling \\"disappointing\\", ONLY compared to all of the six albums they put out beforehand.<br />  It felt like I'd already heard most of these songs, and that they were below par, but only below Led Zeppelin's par... that's still quite a long climb to get to that height.  What I can say most definitely about Presence is that, and I say this somewhat stunned, is that I can't remember how most of the songs go, except for the first song, Achilles Last Stand.  I can see why some have praised Nobody's Fault But Mine, but I felt it didn't stand up with the best of their music.<br />  Still, quite a good album, despite the pressures the four of them were placed under during the making of this album.  It was recorded under much haste, Robert Plant was recovering from physical injuries, and forgive me if I'm wrong, but I also think his son passed away not much earlier.  It was hard for me to see any significance of this album because of the gigantic effort they displayed those few and brief years before, but if I compared it to anything else modern, it's significance would grow.
B0001AP12G|5.0|honestly this album is straight bananas. no other ways to describe it. highlight tracks: \\"breathe in breath out\\" and of course the super hit \\"through the wire.\\" those are just two of the superb tracks on the album. highly highly recommend it. kanye west will be around for a while if he keeps makin records like this.  THE FUTURE OF ROC-A-FELLA???
B000002JSN|5.0|I gave Physical Graffiti the full, highest rating because of the first disk alone.  It's just as solid, just as professional as the first five albums.  I don't know if non-Zeppelin fans would really appreciate In My Time Of Dying, but that song was worth it alone.  But to get five additional songs with it, and all of them very enjoyable, it's almost too much.  Kashmir... what can I say that hasn't already been said?<br />  That disk was so good, in my eyes, but I would have been fine without the second disk.  I do have a handful of songs on the second one that I feel are worth listening to, but I also wouldn't have lost any sleep if I'd never heard them.  But, to point out my \\"likes\\", it would include the first four.  I haven't read too many good things about In The Light, but I'll put my money on it.<br />  This album, compared to the first five, feels more raw and loose.  Maybe that's because of the blending of songs on that second disk, ranging from 1969 to '75 when LZ #6 was released.  Since these were all songs that didn't make the first cut on those previous albums, it was obvious why, but as I've read before, their worst was even better than the best music put out today.  I'll definitely agree with that.  And this isn't even their worst.<br />  In My Time Of Dying... play it for anyone who is skeptical of Led Zeppelin, and let them listen to the half way point of that song when the foursome kick it up a couple of gears.  They proved who they were, and that they were still the best.
0553565915|5.0|&quot;wow&quot; that is what you will say when you read this book. im not much for books, but my friend and her mom have been telling me about this book for a while, and it is so beautiful and inspiring, just them describing it. so after a while, (since i dont like reading that much), i picked up the book and borrowed it from her and i have been reading it. i like how betty J. Eadie is open-minded, unlike alot of christians. she is not afraid to tell it how it is. i can not tell you how inspiring this book is. and im not even done reading it. this is like the best book. im all for inspiration, and this is so beautiful and touching. it makes me realise that the few caring people in the world, actually want and care for what the spirits want in heaven. they think the same way.<br />other inspiring books, and not boring books: Michael Jackson- Dancing the dream- that and this book is the most inspiring books ive ever read. actually when i was reading Embraced by the light, i was thinking that alot of what Betty was talking about, was like what Michael cares about and talks about. hes such an angel. i wonder if he realises how much he is describing heaven and what the spirits want,- love, and truth,and all that. his book is very complex and i have learned so much through that book.so many precious things, and it opened up my eyes.
B000002JSP|5.0|The last of their albums... I had a little difficulty deciding on my rating, but I'll give it one extra star for the all out creativity.  They just tried something very different, and that seemed to divide their fans in half on this one.  I enjoyed it.  I knew what to expect from some of it, implying Fool In The Rain and All My Love, both of which I've heard so many times on classic rock stations.  They were my determined incentive.  Although both were quite different from earlier Led Zeppelin, I had no hesitation in liking them.  They fell right into place with the rest of them, and I never thought any descrimination for them.  I don't have any problem with Led Zeppelin's wanting for change.  If I were there with Mr. Bonham, Jones, Page, and Plant, I would have encouraged it.<br />  It's been such a pleasure reviewing their albums.  I would just like to see other music fans stop degrading Led Zeppelin simply because they have a chip on their shoulder, or because they hear them too much on the radio.  Stop and listen, without placing your emotions and personal inhibitions first.
0553565915|5.0|This is a book about love and truth. You may not understand it at first, because we all wear different colored glasses depending on our religious teachings.  But as I listened to Betty on Coast-to-Coast, it became clear to me.  It doesn't matter what religion you're in.  A Christian can love, a Muslim can love, a Pagan can love -- and yes, love is what it's all about.  Your religion is simply the temple you have chosen for your learning this time around, and all religions are facets of the one cosmic diamond.<br />Souls choose hard lessons for noble purposes.  A soul may choose to be abused so they can have that experience and help other souls, later on in this life or in the next, who are being abused.  A soul may choose a handicap for that same reason, or to be a teacher, showing others how to sacrifice in the name of love.  We cannot judge another's purpose, and we cannot see the wounds in their souls.  Only God can.  Love and forgiveness, and yes, the law of sacrifice, are the only things we will take with us into eternity.<br />There is no need for concern.  We will all meet our deities when we die, and they will all take us to the Great One.  And my goodness, with all the galaxies out there to explore, and all the forms of life in other dimensions, how can we ever be bored?  Betty's book gives only a glimpse of what's waiting for us.  And it's a wonderful as God is.
B00005JMCN|3.0|First, the acting was great. Second, the direction was beautiful. However, if you're like me, an Average Consumer who's not looking to determine if this should be the next Academy Award nominee - the movie itself was too long and the plot moved too slow. At 141 minutes, I was ready for it to end long before it did. The first 30 minutes or so are all background about the people who come in contact with Seabiscuit later in life. In my opinion, all that staging wasn't necessary or perhaps would have been better served to just focus on one person, not three. The film would have been more enjoyable if the emphasis was more on the horse and the races and the amazement of the accomplishments. Also, this movie is not really something a child under 13 should see (it is rated PG-13 after all) but I know a few people who took the little ones thinking &quot;oh, this is just a horse movie.&quot; This is not something they will be able to follow or enjoy.
B0000024SD|5.0|This CD is one of the most excellent collections of Bob Dylan's talent, skill and ability to allow the muse to flow to all generations.  Anyone with a true ear and desire for truth as it is, and not as it is presented by the manipulators of the media cannot help but nod in agreement each time truth is revealed in the lyrics.  While sometimes the facts are delivered in humor as in &quot;Maggie's Farm&quot;, this CD never skips a beat and always hits its target dead on with a bullseye.<br />I happened to be at one of the first of Dylan's concerts after he had gone &quot;electric&quot;.  Though myself and the rest of the crowd were definitely acoustic Dylan fans and upset that he had &quot;sold out&quot; we waited for him to come on stage (45 minutes late) and when we settled our grudge with him about 3 minutes into his first set, our hearts and souls had forever changed and his music still lives on and on. I remember with great respect, that Bob did not even acknowledge our gripes... he just stood there and played despite the crowd's displeasure.  That is because he is an artist and a messenger not a puppet.<br />You will never be sorry you bought &quot;Bringin' It All Back Home&quot; it is a classic of folk/rock electrified Truth from my generation to all others forever!
B00007E8V4|2.0|I dont understand the glowing 5 star reviews.  Toxicity was a breath of fresh rock air, and I usually dont get into metal.  Toxicity was smart, fresh and tight.  Steal this Album isnt any of those.  I would describe it as unworked, musical half-thoughts.  Unless you are obsessed with everything these guys do, dont waste money on this.  So yeah, maybe steal it, but dont blow any cash on it.
B00009V7T2|5.0|This is the first time I've listened to anything remotely related to Mars Volta. I've never heard of At the Drive In or any other projects that they've been involved with.  My brother recommended this CD, and the first time I felt so-so about the disc.  Now, It's up there with my favorite of all time discs.  TMV have definitely pushed the envelope and it's great to hear bands do that during a bad period of rock music.  Thank God for The Mars Volta
B0000DD7LB|5.0|Firts of, I have to say that I am really embarassed of owning this CD. But nevertheless it is still awesome. Britney's albums just keep getting better ( I mean, compared to this Baby one more time looks really sad ). Britney's style continues into dance and away from teenpop. I decided to review every song, since they really  ( in my opinion )all sound different.<BR>1) Me against the music - I never cared for this song too much and Madonna's part doesn't help. It's still good though ( B )<BR>2) ( I got that ) Boom Boom - It's really good, except the ying -yang twins really get annoying, and make this song to long ( B )<BR>3) Showdown - This song is really sexy. The beat also works for me. I usually skip right to this one ( A- )<BR>4) Breathe on me - This was my favorite at first, but after some time I got bored with it ( B )<BR>5) Early Mornin' - Many reviewers really dislike this song, I think it's good, but far from outstanding ( B- )<BR>6) Toxic - This song is my favorite upbeat on here. Its strings remind me of 'Anticipating' but toxic is way more agressive and cooler. Love the video too. ( A )<BR>7) Outrageous - I like this one too. It's a bit repetitive, but still tolerable. Typical R. Kelly  ( B+ )<BR>8) Touch of my hand - Despite the song's meaning, it is really good. Sounds a bit like Madonna. Get over the lyrics and enjoy the music! ( A )<BR>9) The hook up - Not good, not bad. It's a filler, but still has potential - ( B- )<BR>10) Shadow - I really love this ballad and the words, too. Don't skip this one ( A )<BR>11) Brave new girl - It's really cheesy and sounds like 80's, but I like it nevertheless ( B+ )<BR>12) Everytime - My favorite. Even though it's really sad and doesn't exactly cheer you up, it's still the best. I love the piano most ( A+ )<BR>13) MATM remix - Nothing special ( B- )<BR>14) The answer - Sounds like ' I'm a slave for you ' but in a good way. Very dancy ( B )<br />Britney didn't really prove her intellegence by getting married, but she;s written a bunch of songs on this Cd, so props for that Brit!
0393312836|5.0|The Background of this story is dropped in a standard futurized England where a young Malchick (boy) named Alex and his 3 fellow droogs (gang of friends) are at the local Korova Milkbar, a mesto-plus. The story basically tells of Alex, the main young thuggish proantaganist and the many crimes, violent acts, rapes and murders these malchicks particiapate in. The book really begins to take off and capture the reader after alex's droogs slam him over the head with a glass bottle, knocking him out during one of there many rape attempts and frameing him for murder. He is taken to jail by the millicents (police), he serves time and then is realeased for a scientific experiment. During the experiment Alex is forced to watch many short film clips in which people are being killed, and raped and such. As the clips flash on the screen he is administered a medicine in which the sight of violence and rape makes him sick, weak and powerless. Therefore enlisting that violence and rape are wrong, after awhile of this Alex is then released into civilization again and is considered \\"cured\\". In the original story, A clockwork orange ('resucked') the story continues revealing the future of our little teen thug. He grows up gets married and grows bored of those acts of rape and violence that once caught his attention so very much. As Anthony Burgess has said in the introduction of A Clockwork Orange Resucked, \\"Senseless violence is a prerogative of youth, which has much energy but little talent for the constructive.\\" It is in which the 21st chapter that this happens. 21 symbolizes maturity, where a child is no longer an adult and is therefore capable of making there own descions. The 21st chapter also shows moral growth, room for growth into good making little Alex no longer a clock work orange. A clockwork orange is a old british saying (He was as queer as a clockwork orange.) This is NOT meant to be demeaning towards homosexuals. This is just the way people spoke way back when.) To bea clockwork orange is to \\"have the appearance of an organism lovely with colour and juice but is in fact only be a clockwork toy wound up by god or the devil..or the almighty state.\\" On the subject of the movie, Stanley Kurbrick does no such justice to this phenomenal book. He has based his movie on the american novel only featuring the 20 chapters. The only thing i had a little trouble with was the break down of the futurized teenage slang 'Nadasat' which is russianified english. It is meant to be like this for a reason, as Burgess explains in the introduction, to make it sound as though muffled. Do NOT let the language scare you away from reading such an extraordinary story as this, it may seem hard in the beginning but you get used to it in time which is the same as with everything you do. If you do however begin to get discouraged the following site's glossary is made to help you out: [...]   <BR>I have given this story 5 stars because I believe it is an exceptionally genuis piece of literature novella.
B00009QG73|5.0|Roxy Music fans will not be disappointed with this beautifully produced concert DVD.  Frontman Bryan Ferry sounds much better than I expected and the musicianship is superb all around.  Original Drummer Paul Thompson appears with the band for the first time since the early 70's (He seemed to be a real crowd favorite at the Apollo).  The other original band members Manzanera and Mackay sound better than ever. Highlights: guitarist Manzanera's soloing; neoclassical piano intro to &quot;Song for Europe&quot; by Colin Good; violin solo by Lucy Wilkins on &quot;Out of the Blue&quot;; Chris Spedding's hypnotic guitar solo on &quot;My Only Love&quot;; and my personal favorite, &quot;Oh Yeah&quot;, in which the entire band really seem to be enjoying themselves.  DVD also features short documentary on the concert tour.
B00006BTCA|1.0|I don't understand why these guys are the subject of so much love and hype. I got the album and listened to it several times; with the exception of the amazing &quot;NYC&quot; I couldn't find a single track that I really liked. The lead singer's voice is irritatingly monotonic and has that weird 80's feel to it that you find in bands like the Cure or even Devo. The rest of the instrumentation is good, but not striking or, in my opinion, very original. The style hasn't been done in a while, but that doesn't mean its better than any other music out there today, or better than anything it cops to get that sound. I'd say, give it a shot and you may like it more than myself (i happen to particularly dislike the kind of vocals they use), but don't think its going to change your life, like Spin or Rolling Stone or other hype machines would lead you to believe.
B00005MP58|5.0|This movie is better than any Best Picture Oscar winner in quite some time. I am a huge fan of Austen's and this movie has made me an even bigger fan! Each character is perfectly cast down to the silly and stupid Lydia. I can't say how many times I have seen this movie (especially the part where Darcy first confesses his love) and how I turn on the subtitles so I do not miss anything!!  <br />I don't think there is anything more I can say about Colin Firth that other women have not.  Aside from the sex symbol factors, his acting, not with words but with expressions and his eyes deserves him to be a HUGE star. Way underrated!!
B00006BTCA|2.0|This CD was recomended to me because I am a huge Radiohead fan. At first listen, each song sounded strangely familiar to tunes I had heard before in the eighties and early nineties, which made me anticipate a catchy chorus- instead I was introduced to Interpol's lead signers 'voice', which is plain unlistenable. In the recent past, I cannot remember a voice that was so difficult to enjoy. Each song left me unsatisfied and just plain dissapointed. No wonder it was at a discounted price.
0739302043|3.0|Dan Brown weaves a fast paced, time compressing, and fascinating work of fiction that could be spun as an historical investigation slash murder mystery in &quot;The Da Vinci Code&quot;. An enjoyable tale full of interesting twists, turns, and captivating concepts about secret societies, ancient symbology and paradigm shaking religious &quot;truths&quot;, the audio CD version of this book looses much of its luster to incredibly poor narration. While narrator Colin Stinton may play well on Broadway, as the sleeve credits hint, his awkward tone and child-like foreign accents make one wish for an author's reading of his own work. In dialogue between main characters Robert Langdon,a Harvard symbologist who sounds like a tough-guy detective in Stinton's narration, and Sophie Nadeau a French cryptographer portrayed in Monty Python-like female french-english, a really good yarn sounds annoying at times. Overall, and despite this poor reading, Dan Brown's book is recommended. It leaves several questions begging and wraps up loose ends a bit awkwardly, but &quot;The DaVinci Code&quot; makes for a good read (if not a good listen).
B00005J9U1|5.0|Truly this is an mazing compilation. its all of bobs most known songs, and unless you have legend a great buy for sure. I have to agree with Ed that the acoustic version of redemption song is AMAZINGLY better, however 19/20 sweet songs is amazing. Fernando might be right about other songs like rebel music however if your looking for a cd to chill with on the beach i think i would much prefer these tunes because they are super up beat but laid back at the same time, fernando 1 word of advice toke da herb and listen to some bob, seeing your also a big fan your missing out.
0061015725|3.0|I've just finished reading &quot;Prey&quot;.   As I often do after seeing a movie (via &quot;Rottentomatoes.com&quot;), I came in here and got online to read and compare opinions on the book while it was still fresh in my mind, too.   Well, the general consensus here seems to be like mine.   <br />I enjoyed the book on the whole --- and I like Crichton (I, too, can't wait for each new novel).   It kept me up late into the night, I couldn't put it down, and I learned things I never knew along the way, which I enjoy.   All hallmarks and standard Crichton praises, because they're usually true.   <br />I suppose, though, with &quot;Prey&quot;, I have a few gripes, ones that are becoming more and more recurrent with his newer works.    <br />Once again the novel reads like a screenplay / video game (&quot;Timeline&quot;, anyone?).   I miss the &quot;style&quot; of his earlier works, like &quot;Andromeda&quot; and &quot;Train Robbery&quot; --- incredibly detailed novels that seamlessly segued between suspense and imparting his trademark research.   Crichton's current novels (I'd say starting with &quot;Rising Sun&quot;) tend to come to a complete stop in order to lecture the reader --- as in: &quot;Oh, you don't know about THAT??  WELL...&quot;, followed by several paragraphs of dry explanation.   I like the info, but of late it comes across as preachy and condescending.  I was also surprised how alot of the dialogue (like between the children and co-workers) was very unrealistic... often just plain BAD.    <br />And lastly, was I the only one who was curious how much of Crichton's real-life marital situations found their way into the main couple's problems and tensions??   I'm recalling his own recent highly publicized divorce.  Sometimes I felt Michael was venting on his own ex-wife --- via Jacks voice! :-)<br />Minor nit-picks, of course.   All in all, a good book.   Glad I got it, and I enjoyed it alot (it's just not quite a classic).
038572179X|4.0|I can side with those who appreciated and enjoyed this book, while I can also understand the people who lost interest within the first 100 pages.  The tedium of the first 100 pages was my biggest complaint.  My wife tried to read this book before I read it, but she quit within the first 100 pages.  I do not think she is alone.<br />There are many characters who are introduced, and much time is spent on them, and most of them end up playing little to no role in the actual plot.  I felt the character of Emily in particular was wasted, as her battle with her migraines and frailty was memorable.  Unfortunately, she never played much of a role in the first 100 pages, and in fact she was dead and forgotten in the subsequent sections.<br />Saying that, I can sympathize with those who gave up this book within those first 100 pages.  I nearly quit as well, but I'm glad I didn't, for this book is certainly rewarding.<br />The real story begins with a brief episode in front of a fountain between Cecilia and Robbie.  McEwan expertly reveals the sexual tension between the two, while at the same time explaining how a young Briony could misunderstand the scene while she watched unnoticed.<br />The following events of the day are used by McEwan to continue to build that sexual tension.  A meeting in the library between Cecilia and Robbie culminates in a very skillfully done sensuous passage of writing.<br />A crime is committed (not in the library, but later that night), and this is the fuel for the rest of the story.<br />My favorite section was the second, which follows Robbie through World War II.  He is a British soldier trying to survive in France as it falls to the Germans.  His goal is to make it to an evacuation in Dunkirk and live to see his beloved Cecilia.<br />The dirt and grit and struggle of this section are a stark contrast to the \\"high society\\" of the first section.  It was a welcome change.  The tension built by McEwan is really very surprising.  Atonement is certainly not a horror or terror novel, but reading it filled me with a sense of dread.  I thought about this for a long time, and I think it is a function of the author's apparent intellect and his ability to create intensity.  Basically, the reader feels like he's being toyed with by a very intelligent storyteller, one who could bring the story to a shocking twist at any moment.  There's something haunting about this story that tells you subconsciously that the unfolding events will scar and damage all of the characters directly involved.<br />The third section focuses on Briony, and it is well done but not on the level of Robbie's section.  Briony tries to confront what she did wrong.  The wrong she committed on Robbie happened five years before.  Unfortunately, when the author flashes forward five years, he never mentions the moment when Briony has the realization of what she did wrong.  Basically you see her adamantly believing one thing, and then you see her five years later and she believes the opposite.  There is no transition or epiphany for her.<br />The story closes with a surprise modern day epilogue from one of the central characters.  It would be more touching if I had any feelings for this character.<br />In closing, I recommend Atonement to any reader who will have the patience to soldier through the opening 100 pages and then appreciate the tension and dread the author builds in the next 300.
B00005QFE5|5.0|This film is a masterpiece and one of few the movies I felt emotionally attached to. The amazing cinematrography captured the beautiful landscape of rural China. The curiousity that lead to an undying passion was simply unforgetable. Zhang Ziyi's character was vibrant even in the depressing winter, however I loved the pink and red jacket she wore throughout-afterall she is the beautiful maiden of the village. Not a whole lot of dialogue between the couple, but the picture speaks for itself. Even pure love can exist when tradional arranged marriages were common, especially during the years of the cultural revolution.
B00008J2DQ|5.0|when i first heard this cd, my jaw was on the floor i was blown away...it was the best thing i ever heard....this has to be one of the best rock bands these days......and when i heard that they were comming to concert then i knew that i had to go...it was great so anyone who likes real rock then get all of their cds....u really won't be dissapointed.<br />           ~~~~**~~*I LOVE GODSMACK*~~**~~~~
B0000C1733|5.0|I have been a so-so fan and bought the CD on a whim, because I really liked a couple of the songs.  Now I am sold on this band and forgot how many great songs they have.  It's a wonderful CD and I was thrilled to discover a beautiful song that I didn't even know they had done -- Roadtrippin.
0156027321|5.0|Admittedly I did not catch a lot of the clues and hints that make up the bigger story the first time i read this book, but many people seem to think that the Life of Pi is solely a story about a boy who survived being castaway with a tiger (yes, a tiger, not a lion, as a few too many people have said). Reading the book a second time, with a more critical eye, has given me so much more insight into what the book is about. Earlier reviews described the book as having a good plot but having unnecessary,mundane chapters about theology and zoology. Although this book didnt strike me as one advocating religion, per se, religion is actually the core of the novel, without which the book would be a very different, albeit interesting, story. I know that it is very slow to read the first time, especially not knowing why Martel decides to introduce the story with a description of sloths, or how Pi's many faiths concern his survival at sea, but it makes a lot more sense the second time around. <BR>I really liked this book, the first time I read it, and now that Im reading it over and understanding it better, I like it even more. It took me awhile, but chapter 21 and 22 are actually really important, and are basically the theme that connects everything, including the sloth, Pi's views on zoo's, and why there are two stories of his voyage. I dont think I understand the book completely, or that I ever will, but there really is a lot in this book that is inspiring. I can't expect people who didnt like it the first time to want to pick it up a second time, but a lot more is revealed that makes the book a more thought-provoking read.
B000003H2Q|5.0|Most of My Dying Bride's material is very, very good. However, it is hard for me to get in to anything they have done since this album. The reason-this album is so good. I haven't heard any of their earlier albums, but what I have heard of the albums after this (I do own two of them) is a band trying to fit in with their peers. On this album, however, they seemed to be playing from the soul. Call it the `Dark Side of the Moon` of gothic metal and you would probably not be far off. Furthermore, I don't mind death metal vocals. After hearing this album, however, it just pisses me off that he used them in other albums. His voice is a perfect mixture of gloom and schizophrenia, and it mixes perfectly with the violins and pianos that glide beautifully over the crunching guitar licks. For anyone who loves dark, heavy music, this is an album you must have. One warning though; the music is very creative and well written, but the tracks can get pretty long. It may seem to drag at first, but give it time. Once you see the whole picture, it will grow on you untill it becomes one of your favorite metal albums.
0688170528|4.0|I was given this book from a co worker, and I was turned off the minute I saw the cover and saw two teenagers kissing and the subtitle, A Love Stroy.  I SO not wanted to like this book.  But it is so much more than a love story.  It is a scary look at two families that take each other in as extended families and the effect it has on their childerns relationship.  I found myself reading this book and finding it hard to put it down.  Adolescent suicide is a scary thought, but what was scarier is to not know when one person's life ends and the other's begins.  The author uses some tricky twists so you never really know why or who Emily is dead.<br />Don't think that if you are a guy , you can't read this book (wasn't it made into a Lifetime Movie?), because it so much more than just &quot;A Love Story.&quot;
B0000DZTIW|5.0|I've been waiting three years for this day! Now I can finally say that Hans Zimmer managed to give us a second Gladiator! Not in the way that it simply copies it, not by any means, but all the glory, all the excitement, all the emotions that have been kind of missing from the last couple of Zimmer scores is back. Newbies, if you wanna know what makes score maniacs like me get that dreamy look when one talks about Hans Zimmer, get this score and see for yourself!
0345452577|1.0|As an avid Kellerman fan I was very disappointed in this book. ... The Conspiracy Club was slow and boring, the characters are one-dimensional and did not engage me. If Kellerman had not been the author I would have not finished the book, I kept hoping it would be better. I actually felt ripped-off after reading it. It seemed like the plot for a poor TV movie.
B00006SFLV|5.0|I was a huge fan of this show when it was on the air, so I was more than excited to find out that it had finally found it's way to DVD, so I could relive all the episodes and characters that I had come to love so much. <br />Simply put, &quot;My So-Called Life&quot; is a definition of what it was like to be a teenager in the early and mid-nineties. Every episode here is a perfect example of what it is like to be a part of the &quot;Whatever&quot; generation. This show is amazing for several reasons: the acting is brilliant, starting with Claire Danes as Angela Chase. All the secondary characters all also tremendously well-acted, especially AJ Langer as the eccentric Rayanne. The writing in every episode is incredible, very true to life. It is impossible to not become involved in the lives of each of the characters, and you end up caring about each and every one of them, whether you like them or not. You can't help but feel bad for Brian Crakow, wonder if Ricky will ever find his place, or if Angela really is in love with the elusive Jordan Catalano. Each person in this show is so richly brought to life through the writing as well as the acting, that it is unbelievably easy to get addicted to these shows. <br />As painful as it is to true fans that this show only lasted 18 episodes, it is true that at least this show did not fall into the same traps as other teen dramas like 90210 or Dawson's Creek, where the plot is so worn thin that everybody ends up sleeping with eveybody and an endless parade of new cast members make appearances. This show went off the air leaving us wanting more. The last episode fits well here, because things are at the same time resolved and unresolved. What would have happened after the letter? We will never know, and this only adds to the endless mystique of this show. <br />&quot;My So-Called Life&quot; is an important show for thousands of die-hard fans, and I reccomend to all of them to buy this 5-disc collection so that we can live the so-called life of Angela Chase over and over again.
B0000BYM3K|5.0|I was really into Maiden as a teenager, going to the Long Beach Powerslave show, making everyone around me listen to Maiden ect. Around 88 metal started glamming out & i got into punk for my fix. Listen to old IM every once in a while. <br />After not listening to anything after Somewhere in Time, i decided to give this new album a try. What a great album. it's like they havent missed a beat. This album sounds good now & would have sounded good in 88! In my opinion they sound as good as ever. Unlike many bands Maiden has stayed true to everything I liked about them. Aggressive, intelligent, & great great musicians!! And Bruce, well he's unashamedly the best at his craft. still.<br />So IM, you've stuck with who you are long enough - for me to enjoy a triumphal return to your music. If you havent heard them in a while, don't worry - This is vintage Iron Maiden being played today<br />And thanks for not settling for putting out crappy albums like some bands have..<BR>oh yea, by the way -- up the irons.
0385504209|4.0|I read this book in four days, it was an easy read.  The story was interest, it makes me think differently about the Catholic church, and the values that I grew up with being Catholic.  I would recommend this to anyone who questions the Catholic church and their beliefs.  My only critizm of the book was too much detail, but that is probably my complaint about most books.
B00003CXZ4|5.0|I have watched this movie 4 times now and I _think_ I get it. I really dont want to give away the story or any details, but I highly recommend this to those movie viewers who want their entertainment to contain a bit of substance, and those who want to walk away with a big 'hmmm'? Infact if you search on the web, you will find entire web sites dedicated to deciphering this movie. Very cool.
B00000JCOV|5.0|Now I am not only here to write a review on this album but also to say a few things to the people who write one &amp; two stars review for this album, now everybody is alowed there own opinion obviously, but i'm just going to view my side, somebody who wrote a 1 star review for this album said slipknot sounds like theres only two guys in the band instead of 9, That is a bit dramatized but also true sometimes it sounds like there is maybe 4 guys in the band instead of 9,and i think james(A.K.A. number 4) &amp; mick(a.k.a number 7) aren't the next kirk hammet(metallica) &amp; kerry king(slayer) but there pretty good, the DJ sid (a.k.a number 0) gives the band a bad wrap for a lame reason somebody who doesn't listen to slipknot says wow look they have a dj there rap/rock posers like linkin park &amp; limp bizkit! this couldn't be more from the truth theres very few rap influences on this album other then maybe spit it out &amp; liberate.Craig (a.k.a number 5) really i see no purpose in the band for him you can barely hear his work on this album other then maybe eyeless and tattered &amp; torn. Now the bassist paul is probably my least favorite member  he isn't the greatest bassist and i can barely hear his bass period and they even said KoRn was a big influence on them but then paul burns a picture of them on stage. Now i wish the two percussionist chris (a.k.a number 3) &amp; Shawn B.k.a clown ( or number 6) had more involvment in this album there great when you hear them but you don't hear them that much. Now the drummer joey (a.k.a number 1) is an awesome drummer one of the best in there genre. Now the final member vocals corey talor (a.k.a number 8) either you love his vocals or you hate them and personally i lvoe his vocal style. and a reviewer who gave this album 1 star or was rating what he thought was &quot;commercial&quot; music in a listamania said he heard wait &amp; bleed on mtv every two minutes but i have a question for him, if you like metal why are you watching mtv &quot; every two minutes?&quot; Now here's my review on the album<br />01742617000027 - 4/5 AN ORIGINAL  opening the title of it comes from the bar code on there ep release &quot; mate, feed kill,&amp; repeat&quot; and the people on this song saying &quot; the whole thing i think is sick&quot; over &amp; over are talking about a charles Manson documentary<br />Sic - 4/5 Good song, Corey taylor's lyric's are just very angry and i find them some what inspireing.<br />eyeless - 3.5 a good song but after a while gets annoying, and also the chorus going &quot; you can't see california wihtout marlon brando's eyes&quot; is from when the guys from slipknot were in ny signing there contract some crazy man ran down the street screaming &quot; you can't see california without marlon brandon's eyes&quot;<br />Wait &amp; bleed - 5/5 great choice for a single love the fact that corey sings in this one, and why would mtv play this song its to 'hard&quot; for mtv's viewers and mtv won't play anthing controversial or that won't give them anymore money.<br />Surfacing - 5/5 another awesome track that will kick your ass and leave you wanting more. The chorus makes me feel like i can get up and kick the world's ass.<br />Spit it out - 4.5/5 the 2nd single that was BANNED from mtv very good a little rap vocals but just a very little<br />Tattered &amp; torn - 4/5 an odd &amp; short song but i like it you can actually hear what craig is doing in this song.<br />Me inside - 2.5/5  the only song that i don't care for this song replaced purity which was on the original version. and &quot;me inside was actually only an extra on the digipack version of this album, purity is tons better<br />Liberate - 10/5 awesome song great lyrics &amp; vocal style one of the best<br />Prosthetics - 4.5/5 another very good song i love the intro to it.<br />no life - 4/5 - vocals could be a bit better and so could the lyrics but joey's drums kick ass in this one<br />diluted - 5/5 a very sad song (to me) you can feel Corey's pain in this one. another favorite<br />Only one- 3.5/  good but its over to quickly<br />Scissors - 15/5 My favorite track off this album an amazing 8 + minute ballad amazing sometimes its a heavy kick your ass song the next minute ts a slow &amp; sad song. amazing<br />All in all this is a great major label debut &amp; if you are considering bying this album by all means do so, not many of the 1 star voters actually sit &amp; listen to the whole album (i'm not saying all don't) and before i end this i'd like to say this somebody said corey take's his vocals from the lead singer of mudvayne(another good band) but didn't mudvayne's 1st album get released a year after slipknot's debut was released? (which was produced by clown) and why are all the people who call themselves &quot;actuall metalheads&quot; ( and i think i am one) judging slipknot and trying to categorize them? isn't that what mtv &amp; the maisntream do?

1577311523|2.0|For the same information delivered with more elegance, authenticity, and passion, read anything by a woman in Northern California named Gangaji. She lives and radiates what Eckhart tries so hard to intellectualize.  Also try to see a video of one of  her talks--the light in her eyes and in her laugh reflects the truth of her words and goes straight to your heart.<br />It's like the difference between reading a very good cookbook and feasting on a divine meal....Gangaji is satisfying beyond the intellect. Not a best-seller, at least not yet, but she's the real deal.

B0000DD7LB|5.0|This album might be Britney's best.  The songs are hot and even if you normally dont like Britney, youll sure to love this album.  Britney's got something (singer) doesnt, great beats.  For all of you that think Britney cant sing, check out the song \\"Everytime\\".  Britney definetly knows whats hot, and has showed a side to her that no-one has seen before. This album has already hit #1, Britney already beat the record of the first female to have 3 #1's albums, and yet shes done it again for the 4th time! Shes sold more then (other singers) combined and that really tells you something!  You wont be dissapointed with \\"In the Zone\\"
0156027321|4.0|Well written novel that stirs your interest. I love being taken to settings and ideas that seize me and Martel did a great job doing this. Pi is one of those characters you'll miss (Richard Parker too) once the experience has you identifying with his theme in Chapter 94 of \\"concluding things\\" and of a good-bye with closure. This novel has multiple thematic travels to walk and ponder. It did not make me believe in God though to a greater extent than I presently do, as it foretold...but it did underscore my ever-present trust in His Providence and in the triumph of faith amidst adversities. The humorous elements were refreshing and added to the humanism. I loved the contrast of the two stories at the end and the insight we shared with Pi's true experiences as the Japanese stayed rooted to their \\"dry, yeastless factuality\\" (Chap 21 & 22). Leaven for the soul!
B00006BTCA|1.0|I listen to a whole lot of music and I know you have to give a second and third and fourth listen sometimes. That I did here, but the voice was still ANNOYINGLY reminiscent of Ian Curtis<BR>and the music itself is rather dull and boring as others have pointed out. I agree with the guy who said all the 80's guys (echo, Joy Division, Smiths, THE CURE, and even new order...) did it much better and remain &quot;relevant&quot; today. Plus, there ARE several newer pretty descent &quot;goth&quot; bands. I haven't checked them out too much yet but I've heard a few really good &quot;Switchblade Symphony&quot; songs and &quot;Type o Negative&quot; is well acclaimed too (although I don't know if I could get into the latter too much.....my brother says he listens to their album &quot;Bloody kisses&quot; when he needs a good laugh)....but hey sometimes those darkly clad lads are a tad hilarious.
B00005JMCN|2.0|I really wanted to like Seabiscuit, but simply couldn't. It has a phenomenal cast including Tobey McGuire and William H. Macy among others. The actors couldn't compensate for a disjointed script that tries to tell the story of too many individuals too quickly. For comparison, Apollo 13 (another historical drama), really tells the story from the Lovell family point of view with the rest of the subplots supporting that viewpoint. Seabiscuit tries to tell the owner's story, the jockey's story, and the horse's story without every drawing the viewer into any one of those stories. I never got to the point where I cared about any of these characters. And, the rivalry story line just left me flat; I didn't care whether Seabiscuit won. This movie could have used its fine cast much more effectively

B00005JN02|5.0|This wonderful movie shows, how living in Eastern Germany was like until the wall came down in 1990. It lets you understand, what kind of a \\"culture shock\\" the Western lifestyle was for those, who had been living in that socialistic state all life long.<br />Eastern Germans watch the movie and recall tender memories of the way they used to live. Western Germans and people of other nationalities finally understand, that living over there was not \\"just bad\\".<BR>Besides all the negative there were a lot of funny and enjoyable things, that now are part of many people's precious past, which shaped their personality and made them what they are today.<br />I am a German myself, so it was great to watch the movie! The film will make you laugh and cry at the same time. It is a comedy and at the same time a drama.<br />This movie is recommandable for everyone who is wanting to find out more about Germany's modern history and still wants to enjoy a nice TV-evening and laugh...
B000000WJK|5.0|I listen to everything from Slayer to Toto to James Brown to Louis Armstrong, and this is one of my all time faves. This is a life changing album. It showed me that there is so much more out there. It is a roller coaster for the senses which takes you up, down and all around to release you feeling inspired. Northern Soul and Urban Hymns seem as though they are simply albums which this band produced while on their creative demise. Almost as though &quot;Storm&quot; was the Climax. I feel fortunate to have seen this band live many times in Detroit and Grand Rapids in their early to mid-90's hey day. Simply Amazing. Many believe this is the first release from this band. Indeed it is their first full length release, but I suggest getting a copy of their &quot;All in the mind&quot; EP, Or the Verve EP if you dig this album. If it weren't for this band, my appreciation for music would have been so limited. But, it is not for everyone. If you have an open appreciation for true musical art, I would suggest getting a copy of this. LISTEN WITHOUT DISTRACTION!!PLEASE.
B000005AYM|4.0|Up there among the most innovative r&amp;b albums of the 1990's (there haven't been many at all), Erykah Badu's &quot;Baduizm&quot; remains a touchstone of neo-soul. The talented Texan presented in 1997 her debut so full of compelling grooves seamlessly blending together that she was awarded the Best R&amp;B Album Grammy and was featured in many polls on best albums of the year. It was deserved. Not ashamed of her Afro-American descent and offering a tapestry of her philosophies, the young singer/songwriter/musician however unleashed almost an hour of soothing grooooovy music, including Atlantic Starr cover &quot;4 Leaf Clover&quot; and stellar &quot;No Love&quot; and &quot;Sometimes&quot;. &quot;Baduizm&quot; was never (and should never be) repeated anymore and it will at least for a time remain Badu's most representative long-player.
B00005N5RM|4.0|Chuck Russell's 1988 version of the classic horror film THE BLOB is really less a remake and more what is nowadays called a &quot;re-imagining.&quot;  Both films have the same fundamental plot: Gelatinous hunk of sentient goop piggybacks to Earth on a meteor, then proceeds to eat--or, more accurately, dissolve and absorb--every living creature it encounters, while in the mean time, two in-the-know teenagers try to warn the incredulous populace of a nearby rural town.  The original 1958 production, starring a young Steve McQueen, is a satire of 1950s white-bread conservatism, as well as a tongue-in-cheek parody of that decade's popular sci-fi and horror films.  The more recent film, on the other hand, is basically straight-on horror, and fans of the older film should therefore not delve into the newer one with the hopes of finding that familiar gee-whiz tone--it just ain't there.<br />As a basic '80s horror flick, however, the 1988 incarnation of THE BLOB is actually quite good.  The story is fairly tight and gripping, and there aren't too many noticeable plot holes.  The two principal characters are, in contrast to the original, earnest and fairly accurate depictions of teens from the film's era, and the two actors portraying them--Kevin Dillon and Shawnee Smith--are decidedly adequate for the task.  There is, of course, more blood and guts in this film than in the original, with several shots peering into the insides of the translucent monster as its human meals dissolve in potently acidic digestive juices.  And though the amorphous lump of goo here bears a stronger resemblance to Jell-O than to its hip 1950s predecessor--yes, Steve McQueen's globular extraterrestrial nemesis actually looks pretty cool, despite the stop-motion technique used to animate it--the special FX in this film are very well done and quite realistic, and the aforementioned &quot;digestion&quot; scenes will definitely delight gore hounds.<br />Although there is no doubt that Chuck Russell's 1988 &quot;re-imagining&quot; of THE BLOB is built on the dusty foundation of the first, making a qualitative comparison of the two is really unjustified, as each filmmaker created their work with different ends in mind.  As mentioned before, the 1958 film presents a satirical and parodic look at the decade in which it was made, whereas the 1988 film offers up straightforward scares, thrills, and chills.  Consequently, each film will evoke a different response from the audience--one a smirk, the other gooseflesh.  So although the 1988 version does not have the multi-layered subtext of the film that came before it, it certainly is a generator of goose bumps aplenty, and as such, it is just as successful--if not just as &quot;good&quot;--as the original.<br />The Columbia/Tristar DVD edition of 1988's THE BLOB offers a crisp widescreen digital transfer at a very reasonable price, so even those who find they like this version but still prefer the original can afford to have BOTH versions in their collections.88 &quot;re-imagining&quot; of THE BLOB is built on the dusty foundation of the first, making a qualitative comparison of the two is really unjustified, as each filmmaker created their work with different ends in mind.

B000002BBY|5.0|This album is so good it should be issued to everyone with a mind for music, if you dont have, get in your car and speed to the nearest retailer to buy this (or by it from cdnow).  Any fan of The beatles, the stones, the strokes, coldplay, even the clash, go get it............. now!!!
B00003CXB4|5.0|This is a great movie worthy of 5 stars.  But if you're not familiar with it, beware before having young kids see it -- for instance there's a scene of rather cruelly killing the \\"king\\" and the anguish of his son.
0440237688|5.0|What an amazing read! We loved it and recommend it.
B0000VCZKM|3.0|I gave it 3 stars because I love this movie too much for just a single star. The reason why I gave this 3 stars is for one reason and one reason only, no Widescreen. It's a slap in the face to the fans and the cast members out there who have worked hard making this film and the fans who have supported the musical over the years. <BR>As an avid DVD collector, I like to buy Widescreen because I never liked the thought of having a film 'cut to pieces' to fit my TV screen. Annie 20th Anniversary of course is no exception.  <BR>Hopefully Columbia will hear our voices about this and release Widescreen in the next few months...with the same extra features.<br />I'm not giving up on this, not by a long shot. ;)
B00006BTCA|1.0|Sorry, I know alot of you folks like this stuff - for some reason - but this band stinks! In trying to sound like a hodge podge of 80s bands (err - sorry they don't sound like JD) more like the Furs - they sound like no one. That is they have no soul or sound to call their own - they are just another long line of bands who go through their record collection for a 'sound' or songs - because they can't figure out how they want to sound. The only song I thought was OK was the one that sound like it was a complete [copy] of the Smiths. Which is fitting since the Smiths were the LAST pop band that had its own sound...
B00006BTCA|1.0|Heard 'PDA' and 'NYC' and decided to grab the title after seeing good reviews all around with comparisons to groups I have come to respect. Lacking in the A&amp;R comparisons is the actual quality and substance of Joy Division or the Bunnymen. As of recent, the trend has been to bastardize the philosophy and intent of the punk and branch movements. Of the lot, the Strokes are of a select bunch to emerge from the image machine with something melodic, occasionally original, but catchy and entertaining. As for Interpol, only a few tracks are listenable -'Obstacle 1', 'PDA', and 'Stella'. Lyrically, nothing accounts for the pretentiously absurd nonsense. On the other hand, this is still better than any of the carp on radio. But hey, cool name, post-mod design, and someone seems to think this bs is decent, so you could at least pose and make snide remarks with other music illiterates.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|To give to friends and family, and I'll probably buy a couple more before I'm done. Firefly does take its time to tell the story, it was obviously intended to go on for more than a few shows and it set up a lot of plot lines it sadly didn't get the chance to complete. It's not filled with folks in bad makeup pretending to be 'aliens', and it's not juvenile or superficial, so if you don't have any depth to your character you probably won't like it.<br />But man, is it good if you do.
B00006BTCA|1.0|OK, so the lyrics are decent (note:decent, not good), but everything else about this band is just pathetic. Granted, they've got a few more influences than just Joy Division, but there's absolutely nothing special about Interpol. Their arrangements aren't the least bit inventive, their rhythm section, while astoundingly tight, don't offer anything beyond the steady tumble cycle of a washing machine. It's too late guys, Sigur Ros already cornered the market on drenching guitars in [a lot] of reverb. and they had the sense to use a bow, ghostly keys, and GOOD SONGS. That's right, Interpol's greatest weakness is their complete lack of a good song. Indie fans need to wake up and realize that slow and dreamy doesn't necessarily equal good. Some dreams are scary, some are exciting. Interpol's are mundane. I'm increasingly convinced that people only like this band so people will think they're sophisticated. Trust me, it's boring music.
B00011V8CW|4.0|You may have missed this record first time around. The label collapsed near its release and there was very little promotion, although it received critical praise. If you enjoy Bowie for his expansiveness and you like funky, clean r&b delivered suave & British, then you should like this. I read Nile Rogers (who co-produced) say Bowie's a sax player like Bill Clinton's a sax player, which may not be the highest praise, but his style works very well on these tracks. (And of course there are technically better players, but Bowie's artistry is what shines.) If you did buy this record the first time around, you know he made it shortly after marrying Iman and that it feels smooth but edgy, confident, romantic, and soulful, and you probably like it very much, but may be wondering about buying it again for the extra CD and DVD. The second CD feels very familiar to the first, and for me that's a compliment. The bonus tracks from the original issue move to the second disc here, and included are numerous club style remixes and single versions--great for evening drives. The DVD is a great addition; always compelling visually, Bowie just looks really cool here & suited to his element. Full videos and entertaining, well-produced interviews throughout. This was a groovy period for an always interesting and usually brilliant artist. Recommend getting this edition while you can. I'm thankful that a record that deserved a wider audience is getting such lavish treatment 10 years later--it deserves it.
B00005ATQF|3.0|I was disappointed to discover that all versions of Full Metal Jacket are full screen, especially the Special Collector's Edition.  Most DVDs are released as widescreen these days but even in the beginning both formats were often offered.  For this reason I can only give this DVD 3 stars.  Were I only rating the movie it would get a full 5 stars.
B0000VCZK2|5.0|I must say that this is the best DVD set I have ever owned. The uniqueness of this set brings to life the entire Alien films. It gives all of the films justification in a perspective of different dimensions revealing more of the characters that are portrayed. The supplemental discs for each movie sheads more light on each film from the crew's and actors/actresses involved. If you have seen all of the movies in the theaters, then buy this DVD set which will have never before seen footage, which I think is awesome to watch. But, if you like the original theatrical release only, then, you will have the option of watching the originals while still getting the supplemental discs. This set will not disappoint you in any way.
B000002GYI|4.0|With admittedly clever computer-driven tunes, this was actually a pretty good CD/Album with tunes like &quot;Pocket calculator,&quot; &quot;Numbers,&quot; (the inspiration for Afrika Bambaataa's &quot;Planet Rock,&quot;),&quot;Computer Love,&quot; etc. While this was not bad as a novelty, it unwittingly helped ruin pop music in the 80s as producers discovered it was cheaper to make records of preprogrammed beats than of real singing and musicianship. While this trend seems FINALLY to be on the wane, this was basically the one that strated it all. But on it's own, it's not that bad. If an absolute hater of computerized music like me can recommend it, you might wanna give it a try.
0375432302|1.0|This is a fiction book that tries to position itself as well-documented, when indeed lots of things are simply invented. Moreover, it attacks the Catholic Church and the figure of Christ telling lies that try to appear as truths to the simple and undocumented mind.
B00006BTCA|1.0|It's funny how music fans invest so much emotion and time into these bands that fly so far below the radar that they will never have an effect on other bands and in ten years time (at its extreme) will be largely forgotten and sold back to the cd store for the next newer repo-bands. People that don't buy into the major label bands jettison the fact that many of these musicians (please don't call them artists) have had a lasting effect on other musicians. Miles Davis for example. Hendrix for example. Simon and Garf for example. Ask yourself this if you're deciding against a major label band vs a poor man's Joy Division: Was I missing out on something genuine when my dollars went towards this garbage instead. Think about how little time you have on Earth and how better spent it would be to go with Bill Evans. Maybe when you're on your deathbed you'll realize how much a wasted life you were by devoting so much to so little.
B00003CXPJ|5.0|Anybody who gave this film less than a 4 ought to goe baka two za skool.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Firefly from the exceptional TV creator Joss Whedon sounds like a stupid idea at first (a sci-fi/western) but you soon come to learn that this is the best written, acted and shot TV on Earth except for \\"The Sopranos.\\"<br />Its a disaster that FOX cancelled this incredibly deep and intruiging series. Hopefullt another network will pick it up soon, because even a movie couldnt do \\"Firefly\\" justice. <br />This show has it all from intense violence, war, sex and greeat relationships its a must see for all fans of great shows.<br />Firefly please come back soon and Whedon dont give up on this show yet.
B00005JMTN|4.0|There are a lot of high expectations out there for Tim Burton's newest film, namely because it's getting more Oscar talk than just about any of his movies combined. It's been called his \\"masterpiece\\" by some people, but more often than not, it's getting slammed for being uneven. Well, the film is uneven in parts; I'll give you that. As Edward Bloom (Albert Finney), a slowly dying father and husband, ventures back into his past to tell of the outrageous situations into which he got, sometimes that quirkyness seems to hurt things. A few subplots simply border on being ridiculous, and it becomes easy to understand why Finney's thirty-something son resents him so much for feeding him what he considers a line of crap. But then, reader, there are moments in Big Fish (and many of them, at that) when the sun shines through the clouds and you're caught up in the rapturous experience of watching a good narrative. The movie starts off wonderfully, and reaches its pinnacle when the love of Edward's (played in his early years by Ewan McGregor) life enters the picture in a gorgeous moment during a circus. Fish also has some really intelligent things to say about the nature of truth, the bond between fathers and sons, and the legacy of our lives. <br />          The effect of Big Fish upon viewers will be mainly a choice. You won't enjoy the movie if you sit back and agonize over how some of the philosophical notions of Burton's work have been explored much better in other movies; you'll probably roll your eyes at a key scene toward the end that looks like it was lifted out of 8 1/2; and you'll probably know where the whole darn thing is going at points. But you have another option - to sit back and let Burton's own catharsis of the death of his father wash over you in all its flawed, magical glory, and you won't leave dry-eyed. Sure, Big Fish isn't perfect, it is manipulative, and it won't get any Oscars, but it still beats a great deal of 'family' fare out there right now. Lookcarefully, too, and you'll see Ewan McGregor become a full-blown star. If anything, Big Fish is proof that we'll be seeing more from him in decades to come. Hopefully the same can be said about Fish's eccentric director. Grade: B+
B0000VAFO0|4.0|\\"Underworld\\" was released in the fall, which is appropriate, because it's like an autumn night. It's dark, it's cool, and at times, it can be rather cloudy.<br />The basic plot is straightforward. Vampires and werewolves war with each other, for an ancient, unknown reason. The vampires live in big mansions, the werewolves live in the sewers. Both sides have adapted to using modern technology in their quest to rid the Underworld of the other. Along the way, the Lycans are looking for a human that may hold the key to shifting the war in their favor.<br />On the positive side, this movie looks cool. The background, costumes, scenery, and music portray a dark, gothic world. The weapons are also sleek and stylish.<br />On the other hand, the acting is usually stale, and the plot gets bumpy and disjointed. And Kate Beckinsale does look cool, once you get finished laughing at the idea of her being an action heroine. (That's silly, sillier than Michael Keaton as Batman, but not as silly as Denise Richards as a nuclear scientist from \\"The World is Not Enough.\\")
B00003CXXP|4.0|Steven Spielberg's &quot;Artificial Intelligence&quot; is a very good movie! Stanley Kubrick had really started the project but after he died making it, Spielberg took over and he did a great job.<br />  The movie takes place in a future world made up of humans and robots called mechas. The mechas are originally designed to help the humans. But the humans end up making too many and they start to destroy them all. The movie starts out as a mecha is designed named David[Haley Joel Osment], who is designed specifically to show unconditional love, that was the dream of the scientist that made him. The robot is givin to Monica and Henry who originally lost their son, Martin. Everything starts out okay but when Martin is frozen than broughten back to life, Monica and Henry believe that David is dangerous and they leave him out in the woods. With the help of another mecha named Gigolo Joe[Jude Law], David must find away to return to his family.<br />  Haley Joel Osment's acting was amazing! This was the first movie I saw that had him in it but later I saw the movie &quot;Pay it Forward&quot; which was okay but not that great. I also remember seeing Jude Law before too.<br />  I liked the movie mostly but there were also some down parts. One thing I didn't like was that the movie had a sad ending. I usually don't like to watch sad movies and that's why I gave it 4 stars. But other than that it would have been a 5 star.<br />  If you love science fiction movies or you are a fan of Steven Spielberg's movies, then check this one out!
B00008J4P5|4.0|Wow. They grew up. The music is more mature and the witticisms of the 'English' inserts prove the many talents of the White Stripes. <BR> If I could bang the drums and teach my kid brother to gain a stunning voice, we'd do it if we could. And anyone who gets Kate Moss to wrap herself around a pole for their video has to be on the right track...
B00006BTCA|1.0|I'm just so gash darned ticked off that I trusted all these reviewers that gave TOTBL a high rating. Based on those 'Best Album of the Year' and '5 Star' reviews I went out and laid down my 18 dollars. I am very disappointed as I didn't like the music on this CD at all. I thought it showed contempt for the listening public by offering a poor version of a great rock-n-roll style, Post-Punk. I had my suspicions and felt that all the people who'd given them 1 star must not have an open mind to new bands. Something I've always felt I possessed. Unfortunately I was proved wrong. <BR>Find a friend and borrow this CD and find out for yourself. 30 second sound samples on Amazon and at the CD store aren't enough. Listen to the whole CD then decide for youself. <BR>Burned and bummed out...
B0000DZEA1|4.0|I originally wrote a review of the score to &quot;The Fellowship Of The Ring&quot; which expressed general  dissatisfaction.  Since then, I must confess that I was _impressed_ with the score to &quot;The Two Towers,&quot; and --- believe it or not --- I consider the score to &quot;The Return Of The King&quot; to be a _masterpiece_!  I did not believe that Howard Shore could be capable of such growth and expresssion, but I am happy to report that my guess was mistaken.  In this score, he is demonstrating a heretofore-unguessed maturity, the likes of which I could only imagine as impossible before now.  Pieces such as &quot;Minas Tirith,&quot; &quot;The White Tree,&quot; &quot;The Black Gate Opens,&quot; &quot;The End Of All Things,&quot; &amp; &quot;The Return Of The King&quot; reinforce my impression of a composer at his peak, the likes of which shall never again be known...<br />&quot;The White Tree,&quot; of all music, brings to my mind the word &quot;Brucknerian,&quot; and Shore here succeeds in composing a piece of music which puts the original master to the test;  even Bruckner's finale to the first movement of his sixth symphony pales in comparison to this piece!  (And I _love_ that particular music!)<br />No longer is Shore a composer who can make &quot;par for the course&quot; --- indeed, the gentleman here indicates that he can give the great masters a run for their money!  Too bad that he saved the best for last in this series...<br />Additionally, the closing song --- as performed by Annie Lennox, who is _not_ one of my favourites --- succeeds in ending the movie trilogy on a sublimely-beautiful note;  one could easily call this piece &quot;Frodo's Song,&quot; for it indicates the emotional attachment to which this character keeps all other characters in check.   &quot;Rest your weary head&quot; indeed!  <br />One day, I shall compose an electronic score for the three films of which the material is most deserving;  till then, Howard Shore's music shall suffice most happily.  I give it my blessing, if not my unbroken admiration...<br />:-)
B0000VAFO0|4.0|A good job of stretching the envelope on Vampire stories. It may not quite be up to the action in \\"Blade\\", but it certainly has a great storyline, interesting characters, good special effects, and hot music. I can see why some compared it to Blade and Matrix, minor costume and scene similarities does not however give reason to be negative. The story of an age old battle between Vampires and Werewolves unfolds gradually in a way that grabs our interests.<br />I ended up buying a used copy at Hollywood Video. I couldn't pass it up since in my humble opinion there haven't been enough decent Vampires movies in the last ten years, and this is worth seeing again and again. This may not quite stack up to the first Blade movie, but it is better than \\"Blade II\\" or John Carpenter's \\"Vampires\\" in my opinion. I think the 5 key roles were all well performed by Kate Beckinsale \\"Saline\\", Scott Speedman \\"Michael\\", Michael Sheen \\"Lucian\\", Shane Brolly \\"Kraven\\", and Bill Nighy \\"Viktor\\".<br />Definitely worth seeing. This movie grows on you the more you watch it. The first time I watched \\"Resident Evil\\" I thought it was good but it took multiple viewings to really appreciate it. This movie is the same way. Each time I see it I pick up something new and develop more respect for the acting and directing. DVD production values are excellent. Sharp picture and sound. Cool user menu graphics and interface. Includes commentaries, making of, trailer, and other extras.
B00005JLZN|4.0|Those concerned that this is propaganda for the anti-death penalty cause are missing the point.  The politics of this movie aren't very important.  It's really just a thriller, a decent one.  The ending isn't that much of a surprise, but guessing the ending is half the fun of seeing something like this.  Some complain about the acting and writing.  It may not be the best work of anyone involved; but I was able to enjoy it and even believe that people might be willing literally to sacrifice themselves for something they believe in strongly.  The implausibility of it all didn't bother me.  In short, this is an underrated film that's worth seeing if you're not in a nitpicky mood.
B00003CWPL|5.0|Yeah that sort of word gets bandied around a lot. If something is just a little bit weird, it deemed \\" surreal \\"<br />This film however really is surreal and while I don't want to give anything away ( how can I? If I were to describe this you'd probably think I was a bit cuckoo ), it is brilliantly acted. I remember watching this the first time in a friend's house. I brought it over since I really wanted to see it and not some horrible Hollywood movie and all I can say is that when the film was finished and I went to the toilet, I looked at myself in the mirror and I was as white as a ghost. There was not one bit of colour in me. That's how bizarre and scary this film is.<br />However ( on a side note ) if you're looking for a similar film I would suggest getting Un Chien Andalou. Made in 1928 but equally as baffling and surreal. Watch both Un Chien Andalou and Eraserhead back to back and I guarantee you - it's not a pleasant experience
B000002UEB|5.0|I hadn't listened to this album (see how old I am??) in ten years.  Recently, I heard a song on the radio and about crashed my car.  I had completely forgotten the beauty, power, pure magic of these guys.  This album (there I go again..)  blew me out of the universe when I was but a wee young girl heading off to college.  So many friends fell under their spell thanks to me and my trusty CD player.  I even met, and later wed, my one true love via listening to Queensryche.  Now, fifteen years later I find myself listening to it over and over, I'm listening to Sister Mary right this minute.  It's like revisiting a passion.  I can't get enough!!!  I'll never know how to thank Queensryche for Operation Mindcrime and hope to someday see them live again.  THANK YOU SO SO MUCH QUEENSRYCHE!!!!  ~Mary, a true fan for life
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Firefly was the best new series of 2003, but Fox network doesn't seem to know good television when it sees it. Luckily the series has been released on DVD making it available to people who weren't lucky enough to have discovered it while it was on the air.  Do yourself a favor and buy this DVD today.  And don't despair when you reach the last episode because it now seems highly likely that a movie will be made very soon -- and if the movie does well another network may recognize that audiences what quality programming not the same old Ãû ËéÈâ;Ê£²Ë;·ÏÎï;À¬»ø<br />½üÒå´Ê.
B00005JMFO|5.0|A wonderful, wonderful movie.  <BR>You are placed into viewing different peoples lives, who share one common necessity.  Love.  The story is simple, yet complex.<BR>By that I mean, the characters need love, but the different ways they go about it show their own complexity as an individual.<BR>It's a great and romantic movie that wouldn't be recommended as a first date, but maybe that date where you're getting more serious as the movie makes great conversation.  Another enlighening part about the movie is the different age groups of people who were in the theater.  I saw everything from 20 somethings to Senior Citizens, and everyone left with a smile on their face.  Love Actually touches the heart and is 2 hours well spent.  If you are in love, it will make you appreciate it.<BR>If you want love, you'll want it all the more.
B000002JSR|2.0|.....then why is it good enough now? There are two sides to the music industry...the artistic side, and the business side (for an excellent explanation of this, read the liner notes from The Moody Blues' themselves concerning the formation of their own label on the remaster of 'To our Children's Children's Children'). Coda was strictly a money maker for the record company and the band (and who owned the record label?). That's all. During the sessions (as with ALL sessions, regardless of the artist involved), if there is too much material to fit on an album (and back then it was roughly 45 minutes...tops), decisions have to be made to leave something off. So, the worst material is left off, or saved for a later album, possibly to fit in with a different theme. Everyone of these tracks were left off because they were the worst of the worst. The boss, AKA Jimmy Page, thought they were not worthy to be on an album. Then the death of Bonham, and here they are. As a huge Zeppelin fan from all the way back into the 70s, I bought everything I could get my hands on by these guys, including Plant's putrid solo albums. I knew when Coda was released way back that it wouldn't be any good. After the first listen, I was vindicated. I saw it for what it was...a (potential) money-maker.
0345440900|1.0|I'm sorry if I touched a nerve with my not so nice review of Tracy Hogg's book.  It was not my intention to offend those who choose, for whatever reason, (be it emotional, physical, or just plain practical),to bottle feed their babies.  Every family has their own set of circumstances that warrant one type of infant feeding over another.  Bottle feeding parents do need support for their choices, absolutely, but I'm just concerned that Hogg's readers are not getting accurate information, which does not give them the opportunity to make an informed decision one way or the other.<br />This book is just packed with misinformation regarding breast verses formula feeding. The author tries to promote formula, while downplaying the importance of breastmilk, and makes breastfeeding seem more difficult than it really is.  She says that the benefits of breastmilk have been vastly overstated.  This is simply not true.  The benefits of breastmilk have been proved in hundreds of studies, while more and more, researchers are linking health problems in infants and children who received artifical milk.  Again, I am not trying to make anyone feel guilty here, just stating the facts, which Tracy Hogg does not do.<br />IF you read this book make sure you do your research about feeding choices.  Also, use caution in implementing the feeding schedule she promotes, as it has the potential to cause failure to thrive in some infants.
0451191153|4.0|Yet again, a story about the ideal man.  Yet again, a tale of a hero.  And again, individual versus society.  Been there, done that.<br />But never with these epic proportions, and never as well written as this.<br />Like the rest of Rand's novels, you either love it or hate it.  I just started reading Rand this year, and although I disagree with her philosophy in many areas, I have to revere her brilliant, bitter writing style; it made her book live and breathe in a way that few other books do.  I found the character of Roark to be decent, but I think that too much emphasis was placed on his cold selfishness and his indifference toward most people.  Dominique Francon and Gail Wynand, on the other hand, were much more human and convincing.  The philosophy when Roark was on trial could be cut, but ultimately, this novel casts a ray of hope when there seems to be none.

0786868694|1.0|First of all let me just say that I adore Nigella Lawson and would pretty much like to marry her book &quot;How to be a domestic goddess&quot; so it's not about wanting to bash her. She does a great show and has made some really great recipes but with this particular book I can only advise you to stay away....stay far away.<br />It is supposed to be 260 pages long but if you take out all the blank space, the &quot;note pages&quot;, the empty (except for a few words in oversized print) pages which start off each chapter, and the sometimes 4(!) pages of pictures which accompany a single recipe then you're left with more like 70-80 pages of actual recipes. These are divided into chapters which follow the tv-series and this actually works quite well but there are just too few things to choose from within each segment. Some of the recipes are really, really good - like the &quot;Orange breakfast muffins&quot;, the &quot;Chocolate Cloud Cake&quot;, or the &quot;Ham in Coca-Cola&quot; - but all in all you're left with the impression that this book is nothing but a quick cash-in. Compared to &quot;How to eat&quot; and &quot;How to be a domestic goddess&quot; this book shows no soul and no heart and it seems that very little effort has gone into making it. It is such a shame when you know how wonderful she can be when she puts her mind to it.
6300181340|5.0|An Alfred Hitchcock classic!<br />  If you like thrillers, you'll like this one.<br />  A wealthy woman, Melanie Daniels (Tippi Hedren), is interested in some special birds in a San Francisco bird pet shop.  A gentleman, Mr. Mitchell Brenner, (Rod Taylor, [[ASIN:0790747324 The Time Machine]] [1960]) also comes in for some love birds.  Miss Daniels takes a sudden interest in this dashing man, so she pretends to work in the shop for the man who requested her help.

HOWEVER after a few more listens I could really appreciate Sarah's amazing voice and the music is so lovely and relaxing. It just gets better with each listen!<br />Don't give up on it after one or two listens... Stick with it!<br />If you've not already got it- BUY IT!... If you like Sarah's other music you won't regret it! Just wish it had more tracks.

B00005U11Z|5.0|Journey,to me,are one of the most misunderstood and underappreciated bands to come out of the progressive rock era.Fabulously talented,and so much more than the progressive pop rock phenomenon of the early 80's that they were.I must have looked at this dvd on the shelves umpteen times and passed on it after seeing that the 2 Steves were not present.I checked reviews and most were quite positive so I picked it up.The replacements,as they are referred to by the naysayers,quite simply,blew me away.I'll refer to them as full fledged new bandmembers,and their presence breathes new life into this band.Both members shine in this beautifully produced dvd concert.Dean is an excellent singer and a monster on drums,and Mr. Augeri reminded me of a young Steve Perry,with a slightly different,smokey delivery.Both are quite worthy of sharing the stage with stallworths Vallory,Cain,and Schon.Schon's playing is as good as I have ever heard.The person who complained about his guitar tone is completely out to lunch.Schon may have the best tone I have ever heard by a rock guitarist.The picture and sound quality are superb,although Steve is mixed a little low through the center channel.Steve nails these songs and makes them his own.A great disc.Long live Journey!
0385504209|1.0|This is a poor example of a novel.  I place this book on the same literary level as a trashy romance novel (and I don't see Daniel Steel writing bestsellers).  There are FAR TOO MANY coincidents among the main characters.  It is VERY VERY poorly researched and the &quot;facts&quot; are quite inaccurate.  Any FICTION writer that has a &quot;FACT&quot; page at the front of their novel should be shot.  This one page is leading people to believe what Dan Brown writes is true and highly accurrate, when in truth, his writing is just the opposite.<br />If you don't believe me, then buy the book and waste your money.<br />I actually had to force myself to finish reading this novel.
0783229364|4.0|It has dawned on me that I have probably used &quot;The Secret of My Succe$s&quot; as an example in class more than just about any other film ever made.  Part of the reason is that most students have seen this film, so I am likely to get nods of recognition more than if I mention &quot;Battleship Potemkin&quot; or &quot;Citizen Kane.&quot;  This 1987 comedy tells the story of Brantley Foster (Michael J. Fox), who heads from his family's farm in Kansas to the Big Apple to put his business degree to use, but all he can get is a job in the mail room of a firm owned by a distant uncle (Richard Jordan).  Brantley comes up with a short cut but there comes a moment when he has to step up to the plate and impress a group of potential investors with a brilliant idea.  We see Brantley explain but his idea to an enthralled group of rich businessmen, but...WE HEAR NOTHING.  The script by Jim Cash &amp; Jack Epps, Jr. and AJ Carothers (&quot;and&quot; does not mean the same thing as &quot;&amp;&quot; in Hollywood) could not come up with anything good enough to carry the scene so they just turned up the music and figured if we had enjoyed the movie to that point and if we liked Michael J. Fox then we would just buy this and proceed to the happy ending.<br />Contrast this with the movie that might be the one I mention second most in class, &quot;The Karate Kid,&quot; and the great scene where Mr. Miyagi explains to Daniel-san that &quot;sand the floor&quot; means a whole lot than he ever imagined.  That is the sort of scene that makes an entire movie, and &quot;The Secret of My Success&quot; has a big hole where that scene should be.  There are more holes in this film, which allow Brantley to create the persona of Carlton Whitfield, a young executive in a previous empty office (being in the mailroom has its advantages in such a scheme) and provide a fairy godmother in the person of his Aunt Vera (Margaret Whitton).  Meanwhile, Brantley (or Whitfield, depending on your perspective), is interested in Christy Wills (Helen Slater), who is introduced in the most erotic display of drinking from a water fountain in the history of American cinema.<br />This is Michael J. Fox's movie and his engaging performance forgives most of the film's faults in this mindless comedy (mindless in that you will like the film if you mind the holes in it less).  Actually, I was amazed to really see how many stupid things happen in &quot;The Secret of My Succe$s,&quot; but I still like Fox's performance.  If nothing else, this film is a reminder that Fox was a gifted physical comedien.  The world of business does not come out looking well, but then it is hard to find too many movies in the past twenty years that make you think kindly towards big business.), is interested in Christy Wills (Helen Slater), who is introduced in the most erotic display of drinking from a water fountain in the history of American cinema.  <br />This is Michael J.

0142000663|3.0|I thought that the most significant thing in this book was when Tom was telling his mother about what Casy had said to him. Casy had said that, &quot;a fella ain't got a soul of his own, but only a piece of a big one.&quot; I think that this is significant because after Tom says this he then says that he wants to stay around and try to help the small farm farmers. In some way or another we are all connected like it says in the book, we need other people and they need us.
B0000BWVCM|5.0|The mutants are back and bigger than before in the \\"X-ceptional\\" blockbuster sequel \\"X2: X-Men United\\". In the near future, an assassination attempt on the US President by an unknown mutant triggers a vengeful military scientist's (Brian Cox) plot to destroy all mutants. Now to ensure their future, the X-Men must rely on the aid of new allies and old rivals to save millions of lives. \\"X2\\" is one of those rare sequels that actually succeed over the original. The 2004 summer blockbuster contains a complex but well-structured storyline, a top-notch cast and some strong emotional subplots. Patrick Stewart, Famke Janssen, Halle Berry and Ian McKellen deliver some fine performances. Hugh Jackman continues to superbly dominate the role of Wolverine and Alan Cummings is stunning as the gentle teleporting Nightcrawler. Director Bryan Singer adds much excitement in this sequel without diminishing the value of its story and characters. The action sequences and visual effects are quite amazing and a considerable improvement over the first film.<br /><br />If you thought that \\"X-Men 1.5\\" was a great DVD then you'll be pleasantly surprised with \\"X2: X-Men United\\" 2-Disc Widescreen Edition. The blockbuster sequel is presented in its theatrical 2.35:1 anamorphic widescreen format. The DVD contains a fantastic video transfer with great resolution and rich colors. Its Dolby Digital 5.1 sound is truly great but for a terrific home theater experience, the DTS audio track really delivers. The 2-Disc Widescreen Edition includes an audio commentary with director Brian Singer and production crew, a \\"Making of X2\\" documentary, 11 deleted scenes, photo galleries, theatrical trailers, 11 behind-the-scenes featurettes and colorful interactive menus. Overall, \\"X2: X-Men United\\" scores a solid \\"A\\".
B00006BTCA|1.0|interpol, this year's newest rock magazine favorite are, what i find to be nothing more than victims of hype. <BR>joy division comparisons aside, interpol still manages to take unoriginality to a new level. as other negative reviewers have said before; if you paid attention to early 80s post punk at all, you might as well skip this one. for those who missed it the first time, and dont mind a lesser facimile, then this might be a decent introduction. <BR>one of my biggest complaints here is that often parts of songs are lifted straight from the very bands whos influence they wear on their sleeves. &quot;say hello to the angels&quot; their newest single, has an uncanny resemblance to 1984's &quot;this charming man&quot; by a manchester band whos name im sure you all already know. the quirky yet strong rhythm and guitar riffs could come from no other place but the smiths' classic single. I found this happen on more than this occasion on the actual disc, but i find that playing a musical guessing game with &quot;turn on the bright lights&quot; is an enlightening experience that all should have the pleasure of.
B00009V7RF|5.0|Five PLUS!  I agree with &quot;A music fan&quot; comment that the Grammys missed the boat by not nominating this album for Album of the Year.  Regardless, it is on the ballot for Record of the Year and any voters would have to be nuts not to vote for &quot;Where is the Love&quot;, with the Peas and Justin Timberlake.  And, as Reviewer &quot;bryon_mccane&quot; so aptly points out, this album is &quot;excellent and it likes to tip toe on the line dividing hip-hop and rap a la respectable and commercial&quot;.  It is amazing how they could, technically, put all these genres together in one album and within each of the songs.  I also see where it is Grammy-nominated for Best Engineered Album and, for sure, it is that.  Listen carefully the the detail of the beats, genres, and mixes and you'll see what I mean.
B00006BTCA|1.0|I agree with the reviewer who said it's a good thing Interpol makes music in the Post-Punk style. I think that shows they have really good taste in music and they clearly aren't like the THE bands out there who, well let's not get into them shall we. <BR>THE CRAMPS put out a compilation many years ago called 'BAD MUSIC FOR BAD PEOPLE'. At the time it was a nice overview of their music and even better, has one of the greatest album covers of all time. What's my point you ask? <BR>Simply that I really like the title of that album and I think it applies most effectively as a review of this recording. But in an effort to give The Cramps their most deserved respect, I'll change the sentence to 'RIP-OFF MUSIC FOR TASTELES PEOPLE'. That's what TOTBL should have been named. <BR>Actually that's a rather unimaginitive variation, but you probably get my point...I hope. <BR>OK so is the music really that bad??? Nope. The music is actually pretty tolerable. But ratings cover a wide variety of components to a musical recording. The music itself is only one piece of the puzzle so to speak. In the case of TOTBL however, the reviewers who select to give it a low rating are probably showing their preference for the originators of the Post-Punk sound. It's the context of the new recording that matters you see. I'm not really sure any music style, when re-hashed years after it's first appearance, gets the respect it may or may not deserve. <BR>After all, nobody thinks anything of all the bands that call themselves some variation of Punk these days. We all know that they're garbage. Mall-Punk, Pop-Punk, at least they have the level of intelligence to name themselves something other than just Punk. <BR>Well in the end the same applies to Interpol. They're emulating the, to many, beloved Post-Punk sound and to those of us that hold it sacred, it's like blasphemy. Unless you're going to do a phenomenally fantastic version, you're not going to cut it. Pure and simple. And the truth is, in the genre of Post-Punk, Interpol aren't very good. <BR>Would you want to listen to a bunch of young kids playing in the style of early 90's Seattle Grunge now??? Well maybe you get my point after all.
B00007KQA3|5.0|If I were to give awards for \\"the best first 2 minutes/opening titles of any film,\\" \\"The best last minute of any film,\\" and \\"the film most faithful to the spirit and storyline of the novel,\\" all three would go to this version of the Orwell classic.  Acting?  Great performances by both John Hurt and Richard Burton.  His enunciation alone is worth the price of the DVD!  Cyril Cusak also makes a great Thought Police agent!Cinematography?  What a great, gritty look, with drained colors and muted light.  This is a grim and philosophical film, as Orwell, I suspect, would have wanted it.  The look and feel of the technology is also tangible and authentic.  The film's original weak point, as others have noted, wass the soundtrack.  I have no idea why the fine Domenic Muldowney portions were \\"supplemented\\" by the horribly inappropriate songs of the Eurythmics, but the resulting combination was horrible, and --great news-- isn't on this DVD!  We're hearing only great stuff like Muldowney's \\"Oceania, 'Tis for Thee;\\" just right--it sounds like it was written by a machine.<br />On the whole, what a great experience.  You'll watch this again and again, if the sad and gritty plot and despairing ending do not deter you.  A MUST for any serious film buff's library!
B000001FG5|5.0|This is the best Album ever created by the Bee Gees.  I believe that they show their talent at the peak of their career.  I have rated this as the number one Album of all music that I have in my collection of music.  Some musicians have great songs but, there are very few that make everything they produce a number one hit.  You can do no better than this Album for pure music delight.  Unfortunately the Bee Gees did not go on to produce a hundred more Albums and if they had I would have them all!!!!!!!!!!
B000089RVX|1.0|Oh, please kill me. Surely one of the biggest bands of the year would be the worst. This year, that statement was amplified tenfold with this absymal album. Sure, the girl can sing, but the whole thing reeks of sickening corporate manipulation and formula. It's all so typical, and has been seen so so often. The whole shtick just gets tiring. The sensitive, angry teen diary lyrics; the artsy pained screaming and bellowing; the generic sludgy guitar riffing. Wait a minute, this is Linkin Park? When did they get a girl to sing their songs?<BR>What about their videos? Horrible concepts, for sure, but none as much as \\"My Immortal\\": cue the black-and-white, the weepy girl suffering from painful memories. Pass the Kleenex please. How many high school yearbooks and diaries are adorned with lyrics from this band's poison pen? I'm getting depressed, but the nightmare is only starting. How about them racking up almost four million in sales throughout the year? How about their backstabbing of the original Christian rock foundation they were built upon? How about the hilariously prissy reaction to the guitarist realizing the band is terrible and leaving the in the midst of their huge tour? Sure, it's pretty cold-hearted, but no less than the music.<BR>Simply put, there is no amount of bashing I could lay out on this band for the depressing, formulaic, grating, sickening garbage they heaped on the radio in the past twelve months. Wake me up inside? No no, shoot me in the head. If this is the music that is selling the most copies, we are living in a truly sad, pathetic world.
5550155184|5.0|Over Christmas we took and exciting and wonderful trips from the cavernous chambers of Parisian museums to monasteries on the heights of the Pyrenees mountains to intriguing Papal castles to churches in foggy London to green pastures of the Scottish landscape: our trip companion was Dan Brown and our itinerary The Da Vinci Code.<br /> A present from my niece, Karen, the novel was an exciting, thought provoking and revealing experience. Running like a `bull' through the twits and turns of its intriguing plot, it shook our inner souls stimulating at times but agitating at others. We groped wearing a habit, the tortures and torments (aside praying) to keep the flesh from temptation. It uncovered the workings of powerful cabals, bent on destroying our sacred institutions, with their ulterior motives and hidden agendas; by infiltrating first and sabotaging afterwards our deepest believes forged by the very establishments with which they dared to get affiliated.<br /> Doubtless Dan's novel helped strengthen the pillars over which our Roman Catholic upbringing rests, to the point of showing the vulnerability of well-intended living persons and how easily it is to manipulate them recklessly by exploiting their humbled origins and polluting their souls with hateful and dubious claims; we don't dispute the validity of some facts, mathematical or otherwise, but diabolical as means to an end. He did that by bringing a greater introspection and appreciation of the masters' art but in a questionable time line: Da Vinci did paint an interpretation of The Last Supper some fifteen-hundred years after the fact.<br /> With such a clever and rapid prose fact and fiction is hard to part. Readers beware! It's just a well-written novel.
0671027344|5.0|My problem with this novel at first was that the main chracter, Charlie, was a little &quot;too sweet.&quot; By that I mean the author was trying too hard to make us like him. He annoyed me a little, being so innocent and &quot;good.&quot; I also didn't care as much about his relationship with his family as I did about his relationship with his friends, especially the girl he falls in love with. I liked the party scenes, the parts where he gets messed up. I also like the format of the book which is like a bunch of letters. You are like his best friend, receiving these letters. In the end, I really like this novel. I read it about 3 weeks ago and parts of it have stayed with me. Right there, you know it's a good book! So check out THE PERKS OF BEING A WALLFLOWER. Special thanks, too, to the other reviewer that recommended THE LOSERS' CLUB by Richard Perez. That was another interesting and fun novel I picked up off Amazon! Happy New Year, folks! 2004 will be a great year! Let's rock!

0385504209|5.0|I loved this book more than I had imagined I would.  I couldn't put it down!  I kept telling myself that I would just finish this chapter and do something else - impossible.

B00004Z459|4.0|This is a great CD for any kid between 12 and 16, because it's so angry and personal, and many kids will feel they can relate to it. It's the perfect band for the rock novice, because the music is very catchy and well layed out, but for those looking for a more complex and unpredictable album, this isn't for you. Chester (main singer) screams and sings very effectively about trauma's in his earlier life (when he was around 9 or 10, he was raped, then he got into really hard drugs) and the way he goes on about it, he's still pretty upset, but it can get very irritating after a while.<BR>The rapper (Mike Shinoda) gets in nice little grooves in songs like papercut and a place for my head, and the whole singer + rapper dueling together works quite effectively as well (forgotten).<BR>With Guitars and Bass, if you're hoping for some nice riffs and a solo here and there, sadly you won't find any on this CD, the riffs are very basic and really not very interesting.<BR>The DJ makes some cool sounds here and there and he does a full song by himself (cure of the itch - to scratch?) using samples and all, and it's one of the better songs on the album.<BR>This is perfect for the rock novice and the kids, but you're more than likely going to find that you'll grow out of it when you find more imaginitive music, but if you like your music simple, catchy, and easily acceptable, this is for you
B00008WG3U|5.0|This CD just sounds awsome. I only started listening to NOFX only a couple of weeks ago but they kick arse. All the songs sound great and the lyrics are humurous and sophisticated.

0140187537|4.0|When reading Steinbeck it is easy to understand his prominence as one of the great contemporary American writers.  He takes a human or societal flaw and dissects it page by page and the reader cannot but help thinking how real and how commonplace Steinbeck's characters and situations are.  In \\"Winter\\" the author centers on the greed and lust for material riches that was prevalent in America of the late1950s and early 1960s.  Ethan Hawley, the protagonist, is a Harvard-educated man of once-prominent social standing who through the misfortunes of his whaling captain father is currently the clerk in a grocery store his father once owned.  The present owner, an Italian immigrant, is the target of hostility for the simple reason that he is foreign.<br />Ethan Hawley is a man pushed by the desires of his wife Mary and his two children, Ellen and Allen.  This middle-class family yearns for a more upscale life than Ethan can provide.  A television, new curtains and furniture are some of the material possessions they long for.  Because Ethan cannot provide them he makes a decision that incorporates the worst elements of greed and avarice.  He embarks on a well thought-out plot to illegally obtain the money necessary to give his family the luxuries they desire.  And so in lies the crux of this story...what happens to a man that forsakes his morals for the happiness of his family?<br />There are many supporting characters that flavor the book.  Most notably Ethan's childhood friend Danny, now the town drunk, and his wife's best friend Margie who apparently is the town's most popular call girl.  There is also the banker, a teller, and Mr. Marullo, the immigrant grocery store owner, whose tragedy becomes Ethan's triumph.<br />When accepting the Nobel Prize for Literature for this novel, Steinbeck stated that a writer is charged with exposing our many grievous faults and failures, with dredging up to the light our dark and dangerous dreams for the purpose of improvement.  Readers will certainly see a generation's most obvious faults and failures and have Ethan Hawley's dark and dangerous dreams exposed.  Interestingly enough, the materialistic greed exposed in this novel is still very real nearly fifty years later.ers will certainly see a generation's most obvious faults and failures and have Ethan Hawley's dark and dangerous dreams exposed.

0385504209|1.0|Mr. Brown has succeeded in taking a pamphlet's worth of interesting information on DaVinci, mixing it with bits of Holy Blood, and churning out a 400 plus page book filled with a series of non-harrowing escapes (aided unintentionally by some of the most inept police work since the Keystone Cops), 4th grade level word games, and characters with less depth than a kiddie pool. The plot Deus Ex Machinas all over the place, the writer intervening with fate, physics and facts whenever he sees fit in order to insure the welfare of his characters. In Brown's world armor trucks aren't so armored, characters sit virtually inactive 'off-panel' for chapters, drivers involved in high speed getaways at night can NOTE THEIR PASSENGER'S WATCH FACES,  and a professor of symbolism and a cryptographer have problems with puzzles a chimp with ADD could solve (Oh, be sure to give the chimp a mirror though for the backwards writing. Quite a stumper that one). Maybe I'm being too hard on the story, but from all the hype it got I expected more. I believe I've read at least 3 of the books Brown 'borrowed' from so for me some of the 'revelations' presented in the book were a little like watching a magician perform tricks you already know...
068484267X|2.0|When most immigrants come to America from Ireland, they don't return. Frank McCourt's family did. After finding conditions in NYC less than desirable, especially when you have an alcoholic father who can't hold down a job, Frankie, who was born in America, and his family return to Ireland. His memoir of a family trying to survive during extreme poverty as he grows up is quite moving. However, for some strange reason, I felt the film, of the same name, did a better job of portraying Frankie's experience to me. Perhaps it had something to do with the author's style, which I sort of disliked. If you don't see the film, then you should read the book. And I really want to see what happens in the sequel, for you did really start to care for young Frankie and want to see if he will make it.
0440219078|3.0|Lois Lowry did an excellent job writing the narration of the story. The perspective is very clear, and most of the ideas expressed are easy to understand by the masses. Of course, there are some things I couldn't stand.<br />For example:<br />'Jonas almost gasped aloud. To have the power to turn the speaker off? It was an astonishing thing.'<BR>                 -End of Chapter 10 of 'The Giver'<br />'As O'Brien passed the telescreen a thought seemed to strike himm. He stopped, turned aside, and pressed a switch on the wall. There was a sharp snap. The voice had stopped.'<BR>              -Excerpt from 1984 by George Orwell<br />About less than a paragraph later, the protagonist in 1984 says the exact thing that Jonas said at the end of Chapter 10. <br />Another thing that I couldn't stand was the sudden, almost magical transition of the characters' moral appearances seen by the protagonist. <br />The Giver was an excellent read. If you like The Giver and wish to read more difficult selections, both Dune by Frank Herbert and 1984 by George Orwell are outstanding novels.
B00005JJX8|5.0|This is a great movie with wonderful performances by a handsome Cary Grant and a stunning Grace Kelly, who plays a witty young American (she's not playing!). That Kelly thinks of settling in Monaco in the film and later became the real Princess of Monaco makes one suspect that she wanted to make permanent the sort of life she acted in this brilliant psychological thriller. The theme of thievery is subtly parsed by hitchcock, who alludes to its erotic overtones and who, in general, is operating, like Shakespeare on a double level: you can enjoy it on the level of action and drama, and yet there is much more than meets the eye as jewels, money, possession, playing hard (and easy) to get, and the thrill of the chase are all mirrored in the register of romance. The cut to fireworks over the water outside the window as Grace wears fake diamonds but makes real love may have laid the way for the greatest cinematic cliche, but here it is far more than that: the shimmering water, shining eyes, crackling fireworks, and sparkling theme of beauty's temporary nature contrasted with desire's undying love come together perfectly. Like Shakespeare, Hitchcock's works seem infinitely rich and nuanced. A great, subtly deep romance from the master (watch for him on the bus early on) of film.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I only caught a few of the shows when they origonaly aired.  I bought the series based on all of the good reviews I read.  I'm not disapointed!  I'm about half way through the series and the only thing I don't like is that there is an ending.  FOX made another mistake....
B0000VAFNQ|5.0|There is no other way to put this...Underworld is a fantastic movie! It is really cool to see a new dimension put into the vampire/werewolf movies, not too see the same kinds made over and over.  Who would have though that vampires and werevolves would be against each other?  I bought the DVD w/out ever seeing the movie, and do NOT regret it for anything.  It is well worth buying.  If you like movies such as Blade I or II, Dog soldiers, or other movies relating to vampires or werewolves, I guarantee that this one is a must see for you.  And for all the people that are slamming this movie and saying it is bad, they obviously do not like these types of movies because if they did they would give a great review.  Take my word for it.
B0000797IO|4.0|I was pretty sure that this was going to be your typical chick flick and was expecting to nap about half-way through it. However, I was surprised to find that it wasn't anything like I thought it would be.<br />It's not a bubbly romantic comedy. It's quite dark and in a lot of ways reminded me of Donnie Darko (which could only be due to Jake Gyllenhaal starring in both as a mentally ill young man).<br />The pace was perfect. The events unfolded neither too fast or too slow. I didn't find myself getting bored or wondering why all of the action was taking place so soon. <br />It's not for everyone though. If you're looking for your typical Jennifer Aniston flick, skip this one.
B00006BTCA|1.0|i definitely think that interpol are one of the most over-hyped (and least deserving of said hype) of any new york city band today. i'm also really getting sick of hearing them compared to joy division. they sound practically nothing like joy division. who could really? the singer's voice is way closer to ian mcculloch's and they probably sound a lot more like echo and the bunnymen appropriately enough. for what it is it's not bad- the first half of the album is really pretty good (except the shameless smiths rip-off 'say hello to the angels'), but if you want something 'dark' that has swelling music building up to 'tragic choruses' (or whatever else journalists have been saying about interpol) listen to calla. they're way better and more innovative than interpol could ever be. i think in a perfect world people would go as nuts for calla as they have about interpol, but then this really isn't a perfect world. i don't know- if this is good enough for you then buy it, but don't go praising it to the stars because it's just not anywhere near as good as people have been saying. if the hype has piqued your curiosity you'd probably be better off just staying away from this album.
B00006BTCA|1.0|Sure the songs are well written, but nothing we haven't heard before. I think if I could just pull the lead singer out, I would dig on this more. He is just so damn monotone and drab, he adds nothing to the music. Put a harmonious chick voice in there with more range and then we're talking.
B000002GXJ|4.0|Yes the Eagles were imploding at the time this album came out and most of the material is from around 1980 during the bands final tours and months together, but hey these guys are pros and there is nothing in the performances that suggest that anything apart from Happy Campers is the order of the day.  The Eagles have never been known to rock out and expand the tunes ad libbing, remaining true to the studio versions.  This polarises people, but would you rather have Henley do a Dylan and actually sing new versions of your old favourites?  I think not.<br />A couple of things show some inconsistencies like when Glenn says \\"this next song is from the Hotel California album which is out in a couple of weeks\\" meaning Wasted Time.  The crowd don`t seem too enamoured of the song due to its unfamiliarity in 1976 prior to the release.  But that is a nit picking attitude and really some of the best live renditions of classic songs are to be found on this album, Take it to the Limit also from a `76 concert is brilliant.  New Kid in Town reaches new heights in a live setting.  \\"Life in the Fast Lane\\" is a superior version to Hell Freezes Over although \\"Take it Easy\\" is better on HFO.  The Long Run is great especially the crowd chat.  Two new songs for the Eagles that is, \\"Seven Bridges Road\\" showcases the vocal skills of the band and All Night Long a Walsh tune off the Urban Cowboy soundtrack is helped by a great choir of Roadies and Friends, great stuff.  <br />This release could only be bettered by including Tim Schmit`s Keep on Tryin` from his Poco days which apparently the Eagles were doing live around the time but that wasn`t to be.  Anyway still a great live album from one of the best.
0780622650|1.0|What the heck happened with this movie? Where do i begin reviewing such an aweful film without offending those involved? Is that EVEN possible? I never thought i would find anything worse than Ishtar... I was very wrong.    This movie has some very good actors (Matt Leblanc aside), and the original series  had a popular if not downright Americana cult following.  Most offensive was the 'acting' from Leblanc himself who seemed to be more in the role of 'Joey' from the sitcom friends.  Worse than that, it seemed like 'Joey' was trying to act the part of the pilot (if you can imagine).  William Hurt... and it showed.  I've said it before and I'll say it again: instead of buying or renting this video, you'd be better off cutting s hole in your rug to watch the floor show- The time will be just as productively spent.  I would mention the work of the other actors in this film, but their careers just don't deserve it.  If your looking for an 'okay' or better Sci-Fi film, look elsewhere, there are many to choose from.  A note of credit to Mr. Leblanc, sir, your acting has improved greatly since this post mordem catastrophe, keep on top of it 'friend'.
B000005DQR|5.0|This album has got alot of critical acclaim and none of you have probably heard it.    DJ Shadow is the master of sampling.   Now most of you probably think of sampling like Puff Daddy, this is totally different.    DJ Shadow takes many small samples from many different unknown songs and combines them and makes them into masterpieces.    Without words DJ Shadow says so much.  His music just touches your soul (for those that have one)  For instance the song  \\"A Midnight In A Perfect World\\",  if I was living in a perfect world and it was midnight, I have a feeling this music would be the soundtrack to it.    This might be labled trip hop by some, which is fine, but alot of your favorite artists are DJ Shadow fans.    Radiohead has openly said they are influenced by DJ Shadow.    If you don't own this album, get it now.
B000089RVX|5.0|TO ANYONE AND EVERYONE WHO DOESN'T LIKE ROCK MUSIC, THERE'S STILL HOPE.  I'M ONLY INTO R&amp;B AND SMOOTH JAZZ, BUT AFTER HEARING THE BALLAD &quot;MY IMMORTAL&quot;, MY GOODNESS... NO WORDS CAN BE FORMED ACROSS MY LIPS TO EXPRESS HOW DEEP THIS SONG WILL PENETRATE YOUR HEART.  IT'S THAT GOOD!!!  BIG &quot;UPS&quot; TO AMY.  GIRL, YOU GOT IT GOIN' ON.  THE OTHER TRACKS ARE REALLY GOOD SONGS FOR CERTAIN SITUATIONS LIKE DRIVING OR WORKING OUT, WHICH STILL MAKES THEM GOOD.  ONE THING I WASN'T A FAN OF, IS SOME PLACES THEY SHOWED SIGNS OF HEAVY METAL, BUT IT'S OK, THEY DID A MAGNIFICENT JOB ON THIS ALBUM, WITH JUST &quot;MY IMMORTAL&quot; ALONE.  LET'S HEAR ANOTHER HEART-STOPPER ON THE NEXT LP, AMY AND BEN!
B00006BTCA|1.0|This really isn't a bad album, but it is very derivative. Everytime I listen to it, I end up taking it out and putting in the Joy Division box set. <BR>I like it much more. <BR>If you want to listen to Joy Division, listen to Joy Division.
055357342X|3.0|While Martin has much to recommend his writing style including very good personality building in his books this series just doesn't seem to move ahead.<BR>We begin the series with a scary dungeons&dragons chapter in the \\"enchanted forest\\" and warned that WINTER IS COMING but than the story gets bogged down in the mundane politics of the kingdom. And by the end of three heavy books we're just starting to see autumn! <BR>Also Martin chose to write the series as a multi-point-of-view story making the story long, slow, and non-focused as each character develops a semi-independent story of its own. With several of them dying along the series and almost all of them losing their way (metaphorically speaking) the reader looses himself the larger picture and just hopes they would survive another day.<BR>Aside from this I found his descriptions of sex, violence and the characters' constant thoughts of past wrongs and losses overlong, repetitive and tedious.<br />So to summarize while I can't say I didn't enjoy the series character portrayal and vivid descriptions the series ultimately suffers from the lack of focus on a main subject as it goes from the subject of magical winter to that of electing a new king for the kingdom and to each characters' personal concerns.<BR>It seems now-a-days that Martin plans to make this series seven-book long when I honestly believe it would have been better to make it a trilogy so that readers could actually see a development in the \\"big-picture\\" of the main themes of the series.
B00006BTCA|1.0|Bands that attempt to capture the spirit of the post punk explosion of the late 70's/early 80's are usually doomed right out of the starting gate; and for a simple reason: what Joy Division, Wire, Echo and the Bunnymen, et al, recorded back in the day is still just as fresh, just as relevant today. Bands such as Interpol will always be pale reflections of something much better; indeed, Bright Lights is treated as something fresh, when in fact there has been a seemingly endless attempt to be the next Joy Division for twenty years. But I suppose success has more to do with favorable marketing and less to do with the talent of the band. And while there is talent here, the songs are dull. Perhaps a litte more originality would go miles to change that. Do yourself a favor: go pick up The Smiths.
B00006BTCA|1.0|Taken by itself, this is a decent record. But nothing exists in a vacuum, and compared to this bands' sources of inspiration their music pales. This is superfluous and indulgent. All of the originals are there - ready to be discovered. And please, the Song &quot;Say Hello to the Angels&quot; borders on [imitation], this is just too similar to The Smiths' &quot;This Charming Man&quot;, and vastly inferior. <BR>Instead, Try these: <BR>The Smiths - Hatful of Hollow<BR>The Chameleons - Script of the Bridge<BR>The Psychedelic Furs - eponymous<BR>Public Image Limited - Public Image\First Edition <BR>These are 4 archetypal New Wave recordings, these are the sources. <BR>Being inspired by the past can be a good thing, but neglecting to inject any new blood or ideas lead to graverobbing, vampirism, and other undead manifestations as it were! ;) <BR>And no - since I'm sounding frightfully dark - New Wave is not the same as Goth, Goth is an original strain of New Wave; see Sisters of Mercy, The Mission, et al. ;) <br />Can New Wave angst ever be replicated in the USA? Hmmm...
B00006BTCA|1.0|At what point does a tribute band become shameless rip off artists? I would say w/ this Interpol album. You can hear bits of Gang of Four, The Chameleons, PIL, and Joy Division throughout. The guitar interplay completely rips off The Chameleons circa &quot;Script of the Bridge&quot;. Completely empty is how you feel after listening to this - and you'll find yourself reaching for your copy of &quot;second edition&quot; or &quot;entertainment!&quot;. This guys voice is awful - a shame they can't ape the amazing vocals of Mark Burgess or Ian Curtis. The worlds biggest cover band is on display with this release. Save your money and save originality.
B00006BTCA|1.0|Yawn. Another bunch of hipster darlings who get way too much credit. They've added a little bit of joy division darkness to distinguish their own brand of trendiness from the harder-rocking fakery of the Strokes, but it still comes out boring. Doesn't anyone realize that goth bands have been making &quot;interesting soundscapes&quot; with &quot;dark themes&quot; and echoing &quot;joy division and the psychedelic furs&quot; for years? And although goth bands have produced more than their share of boring pabulum, the best ones haven't ever been noticed outside of small circles -- but as soon as Interpol sounds a little like joy division or The Faint figures out how to use an arpeggiator they're suddenly new and exciting. The only surprising thing about 'turn on the bright lights' is the bizarre, snarky sense of humor that lurks behind the suicidal posturings -- maybe if they let more of that out to play they'd be more than another lame trend.
B0000DD7LB|1.0|Once again, Britney proves that she's eye candy.  Her voice!  That awful nasal squeak!  She's easy on the eyes but the voice will make your ears bleed.  One more step toward a Playboy spread.
B000089CJI|2.0|I purchased this album on the strength of hearing &quot;Such Great Heights&quot;. This is an absolutely terrific song, mixing a upbeat electronic tune with great singing and a wonderful topic (lovers separated by distance and a song to &quot;guide you home&quot;). <br />I really expected great things from the rest of the album, alas.. this is the only song like it on the album. The rest of the songs are a mixture of slow-paced (really slow!) songs and upbeat songs about depressing topics.<br />The album starts off with &quot;The District Sleeps Alone Tonight&quot; which is a good example, it starts off with 2 minutes of extremely slow, quiet music.. if you can stay awake long enough it picks up, but the subject is about a destroyed relationship and the singer hanging around her apartment feeling like a stranger and discovering that &quot;I'm the one worth leaving&quot; whatever that means.<br />Other thrilling subjects are a person who discovers there isn't any true love and makes a movie with his ex to try and simulate it, the depressing life of hanging out in anonymous bars (or possibly prisons depending on how you interpret it) and about people dying and exploding...not exactly the subject matter I want to listen to.<br />Other reviews have praised the production qualities but I found the vocals tended to get lost in the music, many times I found I was straining just to hear the vocals. Ben Gibbards vocals are very unique and easy to listen to, but for many of the songs he is half whispering and half talking rather than singing and tends to get lost in the background.<br />So a mixed review.. After listening to the entire album quite a few times I can honestly say the only song I like is &quot;Such Great Heights&quot;...however if you like slow serious electronic music or the upbeat tempos and don't mind the subject matter, perhaps this one is for you.
B00005JSGK|1.0|The name of the movie almost sounds \\"African\\". This is one of John Wayne's `travelogue movies' as I have come to call them. <br />The movies basically stink yet they have several ingredients common to the script which makes them easily identifiable. First they are shot on location, Africa, Hawaii, at the circus or to the backdrop of some unusual profession as in Hellfighters. <br />Second, and this never fails, Duke is always much larger than other men in the cast and also much older. In the case of Red Buttons, nicknamed `Pockets' in this movie, and Hardy Krueger, the short German method actor, Duke appears almost menacing with his enormous size compared to the other actors and threatening repartee. The sperm count of the cast must have been microscopic. <br />The third ingredient is that Duke had lung cancer and was diagnosed in 1963 during the filming of The Sons of Katie Elder. So in movies like Hitari, and Donovan's Reef, he was still turning the girls on with cigarette breath and using Camels as sexual paraphernalia. <br />The fourth ingredient is what I call `zany nonsense'. There is always some kind of idiotic chase scene comic relief thing going. In the case of Hitari, Duke loads a baby elephant in the back of a jeep and then rides off like a maniac terrifying the animal all in the attempt to chase down an Italian model turned actress named `Dallas' as she was trying to get the heck away from Duke and his absurd missed love cues. If Duke was the prize bull amongst all of the midget male actors, he sure came off as brain damaged. His shaving cream kiss with Dallas looked more like State's evidence than affection. <br />The last ingredient is the `show you how it's done' thing. Some portion of these movies is always dedicated to some mandatory action footage about how to do whatever it is that Duke is supposed to be an expert doing. It is just filler to hide the lack of plot. For example in Hellfighters, it was putting out oil fires, in Hatari there is the usual obligatory action scene featuring Duke wrestling what could only be a drug induced Rhino into submission with the help of friendly African Natives and lots of rope. Animal rights activists might find these scenes appalling however movie critics would find the entire film appalling. One star is quite generous
B0000DJZA0|4.0|I am a HUGE Coldplay fan and found this DVD to be well worth the money. For those who were unfortunate to miss out on seeing them live (like me) this does make you feel like you are in the audience watching them. And even though most of the members stayed relatively stationary throughout the songs(except when Chris thrashes around on stage to 'yellow'- when perhaps he should have stayed seated), the energetic lighting and multiple camera angles, not to mention Chris's passionate vocals, keep the mood vibrant and energised. Visually the concert is very good, and the music is excellent with some of the songs sounding better than they did in the studio recordings. <br />The only thing that was dissapointing was the tour diary. I am a huge fan of coldplay's music, but also their personalities. From the small amount of footage i have seen of them in interviews they all seemed like really funny and charismatic guys- especially Chris. So when i found out that there would be a behind the scenes documentary included in the DVD i waited with baited breath, desperate to get greater insight into their individual personalities and the way that they live. However,this documentary fails to do that. One of the most frustrating things about the diary is probably the fact that there is a lot of footage of them on stage, and considering that we already have access to a full concert i found this to be unneccessary and the time should have been used to showcase who they were as people. Also watch out for Gwyneth Paltrows blink and you'll miss it appearance on the documetnary (she was on tour with them at the time)
B00006879E|5.0|This is amung the best CD's I have added to my collection in a long time. I really don't know how to classify their music, it's just really good. The most notable songs are Harder to Breathe, Not Coming Home, The Sun, Tangled, and Shiver. As you can see, I don't normally write reviews about music, but I felt that this CD was worth writing about. Give it a listen, you won't be dissapointed.
B00006879E|5.0|So few words can describe the talent that is present within Maroon 5. They are the most unique thing I have heard in a long time. They combine elements of several other different kinds of music to get a style unmistakable with anyone save their own. Everytime I listen to the CD, I find myself liking more and more of their songs (it's sort of scary, actually). I see great things in the future of Maroon 5, as they have done something so many have strove to even scratch the surface of. They have found a unique voice. With great vocals, twisted (and sometimes somewhat creepy) music, lounge style piano, and the ability to the hard and the soft, Maroon 5 is a band we shold be seeing a lot of.
B000002NHN|5.0|Absolutely beautiful!!  I have all her CDs and must say this one tops the cake!  Her other CDs have a few good compositions (at least in my opinion), but every song on this CD is wonderful!
B00006BTCA|5.0|Amazingly dark. Post-punk still creeps out of the  cracks in the concrete and envelopes one in  black clothing and intense songs.<BR> Fans of Joy Division, early Echo and the Bunnymen, Television, and some Killing Joke would sure to enjoy this dark release.<BR> Definately has set up residency in my car cd player for over a year now.<BR> Can't wait for more.
0446530573|5.0|This book is one of those clever ideas that makes you want to say &quot;Why didn't I think of that before?&quot;  There's no shortage of reference and pics from everybody's favorite HBO mob family, but the recipes in here are genuine, wonderful Italian food.  But the best part?  Somehow, the recipes in here make you look GOOD no matter how skilled a cook you are.  I can tell you now that I'm in the less talented bracket to put it mildly, but the recipes in here have the virtue of being eye-catching and flavorful (incredible use of spices) while not being too difficult to put together.  A rare combination.  Definitely a book to grab whenever you can.
B00005JMFI|1.0|ok this movie is pretty bad. i suggest if you must see it wait till it comes out on video and dvd, then rent it. i didn't like it because they spent hardly any time at the north pole, so you don'y know much about the north pole. it just falls flat. i do love will ferrel, but not in this movie.
B00006BTCA|1.0|This CD seems to generate pretty extreme views; people either hail it as a work of brilliance or denounce it as a tired retread of the 80s. In fact, I think there is something to both views. There are a handful of very strong songs on this album; I would say the first three songs, and the song &quot;Hands Away&quot; are all pretty interesting. They have something of the majestic remoteness of certain Cure songs (&quot;Plainsong&quot; comes to mind) without really sounding like The Cure. These also happen to be the songs in which the vocals are the least prominent. <BR>But when the band gets cranked up with their jangly guitars and that irritating voice, they start to sound like any number of 80's bands, and not the better 80s bands, either. A lot of people have mentioned groups like Joy Division, but I think that is undue flattery; more often, they sound to me like The Fixx, Flock of Seaguls, or Saga (songs like &quot;Stand or Fall&quot; or &quot;I Ran&quot; could be dropped seamlessly into this album). There are also ocasional flashes of groups like Ultravox or the earlier OMD albums. I don't see the comparison with the Psychadelic Furs at all. <BR>I have to say, though, that I am surprised at the popularity of this album. Interpol seem to be trying to do the same thing with 80s music that the White Stripes are doing with 70s rock, borrowing from the past rather than innovating and developing their own sound. I can understand why a band would want to do this: it's a lot easier to copy than to produce something fresh. But why are people so eager to buy it? Wouldn't it be better to listen to the originals from which these sounds are derived? It's a mystery to me.
B00000DHRZ|5.0|I have every album from Smash up and this CD brings it all to the table.  Some say that the Offspring has been deluted by mainstream pop, but that is a whole bunch of crap!  They are one of the few bands that has kept doind what they wanted to and this CD is no different.  <br />Welcome-10/10 intro baby!<br />Have You Ever-10/10 Back to their roots with hardcore punk!<br />Staring at the Sun-9/10 Awesome fast paced song, catchy too!<br />Pretty Fly(For a White Guy)-10/10 Offspring shows their traditional antics here, and this is probably one of their most known mainstream songs.<br />The Kids Aren't Alright-12/10 My favorite Offspring song!  Awesome lyrics talking about his old neighborhood.  I love the pain and anguish Dex brings to the table, this is a nasty song!<br />Feelings-8/10 remake by the Offspring thats all I need to say and you should know its gonna be funny.<br />She's Got Issues- 9/10 Single from this CD, awesome punk/fun feel.<br />Walla Walla-10/10 Definately a punk song with great chords and chorus!<br />End of the Line-10/10 Rapid punk fast paced song!<br />No Brakes-9/10 great, pure greatness!<br />Why Don't You Get a Job?-10/10 funny, funny, funny, but true!<br />Americana-10/10 Hey this goes out to Dex, like he would ever see this, but anyway, America is exactly like this, isn't that weird?<br />Pay the Man-7/10 Awkward, but it grows on you.  There is a stupid ending thing for PFFAWG, but its worthless, yet it doesnt detract from ther ecord.  Overall this gets a perfect 10/10 baby, alright traditional Offspring!
0316666343|3.0|One could think Heaven is a wonderful and undisturbed place since it's our final destination and a coronation of a temporal life (well, maybe for some of us). But not the author - for her it's rather more like hell! Being an angel seems to be a cruel penalty for humans. The main character died but still missed her earthly life instantly hoping someone down there would think of her for at least a while and regreting things she didn't manage to experience. Living in such Heaven would surely be exhausting and depressing whereas as an angel you cannot do anything to interfere with any aspect of life of those who are still alive - neither to help nor to hurt them in any way.
B00003CXS4|3.0|Brit gangster flick with surprises and a grey overcast tint.  Brad Pitt was great as the whacked out boxer with the golden fist.  Very stylish and funny.

B00004R7TP|5.0|&quot;Under Ice&quot; will send cold chills down your spine as you conjure up a story in your own mind,with your own supressed idea of the boogie-man coming to the &quot;surface.&quot; This may sound like mumbo-jumbo,but the singing,words,music, and sounds are a perfect blend,guaranteed to make the hair on the back of your neck stand up straight!!<br />&quot;Waking the Witch&quot; also has the same effect.Very creepy and clever.&quot;Running Up That Hill&quot; is a poignant song of unrequited love,and anyone who has been there will attest to that!<br />Each track on this CD allows you to extract your own,personal interpretation.In short:All of the tracks are brilliant.This is my favorite Kate CD.
B000089Q9D|5.0|This movie will make you laugh,cry and look back at your own life. You will never forget this movie!!   <BR>Probably one of the best movies ....ever.<BR>BRAVO!!!! <br />BRAVO!!!!
B00003CXC7|3.0|Well done, and all from the bed room window of the apartment.  The ending was pretty lame, and not at all credible.  But, the ending comes so quickly, it does not ruin the previous parts of the film, which are fairly clever.  Not for everyone-but if you like Hitchcock, this is a must.
B00009ATKS|4.0|I believe so. In my eyes (and ears, more importantly), this is the most triumphant Mogwai release to date. Its the most mature, layered, and most well produced collection of material put out so far, really sounding more like a progression through sound as you listen, rather than just songs that seem to be randomly placed. The music served up this time around still possesses the dark yet warm mood through their songwriting, yet at times they shed a little light on a more pop sound, at least more than ever before. Its a lighter-sounding overall album, but still pull off what seems to be the most haunting music they've ever made. The sparse positioning of distorted vocals here and there really make for a great finishing touch on an already well-layered musical masterpiece. With this release, it only seems that Mogwai's best days are still ahead of them. This also seems like a good CD to start off with if you're a beginner, and want to expand your horizons with some more experimental musicianship. This is guaranteed not to disappoint.<BR>For fans of: Godspeed You Black Emperor, Sigur Ros, Do Make Say Think, Radiohead, Explosions in the Sky, etc.
0671027344|5.0|This book was absolutely amazing! Currently im a high school student and this book was an amzing relation to my life, to the happenings going on. It really makes you appreciate life, and it teaches you alot. The book truly allows a relationship to develope between the main character Charlie, and the reader, because all he writes, he writes to you. It's a wonderful book with amazing quotes, deep thoughts, and general teenage angst. <BR>I recommend it for any and all HS students or College students, i dont kno how much older people will relate to it, but it is still an amazing book.
B0000AUHPG|5.0|This movie is perhaps one of the most unappreciated westerns of all times.  It still amazes me at the number of people I speak to who claim to be fans of the western genre, and yet have never even heard of this movie.  While not as well known (or as fast pased) as any of Leone's \\"Fistful of Dollars\\" movies, this movie is technically superior to all of them.  Leone is on top of his craft here, using the camera to highlight the actors's faces in gigantic close-ups, the shear size of them grant the actors an immediate epic status.  This movie is admittedly very short on dialogue and on action, but the movie is an extreme study in mood.  The style of the movie is almost operatic in its conception.<br />I'd like to say a few words about the dvd.  The transfer is bright, and with a few minor exceptions there is no noticible grit from the transfer.  The commentary is a rather mixed dish, with so many actors, directors and critics contributing to it that you end up with portions of it that are very good and others that you wish would just be quiet.  The Documentary on the second disc is very well done and while it employs the same people as the commentary, a much more consistent experience.  If only all dvd releases could be this good!  Considering the price and the quality and number of the special features, it is perhaps one of the best priced dvds on the market
B00000J7J7|5.0|Finally there's a piano solo album in my collection that can match Keith Jarret's 'Facing You' (1971). It's Brad Mehldau's 'Elegiac Cycle'. Haven't heard such a great piano solo album in years. 'Elegiac Cycle' -released in 1999- was a revelation to me. This guy's playing takes your breath away. On 'Elegiac Cycle' Mehldau plays improvisations inspired by the theme of 'loss'. His playing is daring and adventurous, and because he has a perfect sense of structure as well, he never gets lost and keeps everything in perfect balance. And on top of this, his playing is deeply moving. In Mehldau's playing we can discern a lot of influences from the realms of classical and jazz music. I hear a lot of Bill Evans and Keith Jarrett, but, much more important, I hear foremost a pianist with a distinct style of his own. His classical training seems to contribute to this distinctness of his playing. On 'Elegiac Cycle' I hear the influence of Bach's contrapunt, especially in 'Memory Tricks'. I hear a bit of Debussy in 'R&uuml;ckblick', and each and every time it's a big sensation to hear the opening and ending-segment of 'Trailer Park Ghost', which sounds in my ears as the perfect blending of the enraged energy of Schubert's 'Der Strom' and the odd-mystical melodic intervals in the middle section of Scriabin's piano-piece 'Po&egrave;me vers la flamme'. In the longest piece on the cd, 'Goodbye Storyteller', Mehldau reveals all his poetic qualities -using a Rachmaninoff-touch here and there- and makes a deeply moving and unsurpassable statement about the way 'beauty and loss' are interconnected. Brad Mehldau's 'Elegiac Cycle' is my favourite album of 1999, and most certainly one of my all time favourite albums. It's a masterpiece, and nobody with a serious interest in good and enriching contemporary piano music can afford to miss this album.[22-1-2000]
B00004XPP0|5.0|When Star Wars opened in 1977, theaters were packed, with audiences waiting in lines to see the \\"space opera\\" that George Lucas had masterfully crafted.  The movie, which became one of the top-grossing films of all time, changed forever the way science fiction movies were made, elevating the genre from the realm of B movies to serious fiction, so much so that the original Star Wars movie, subtitled \\"A New Hope\\", was nominated for the Best Picture Oscar that year.<br />The technology of the time was somewhat limited, and though it was considered \\"cutting edge\\" in its day, special effects limited the vision which George Lucas had hoped to present to his worldwide audience.  It seemed only fitting therefore that on the anniversary of his Opus, he would return to the world of Star Wars once more, re-inventing the movie that launched a franchising monstrosity in a galazy not so far from home.<br />What was created was the extended edition of the Star Wars movies, with a special focus on the first installment, \\"A New Hope\\".<br />Industrial Light and Magic, Lucasfilm's effects house, which was in its infancy at the time Star Wars was produced, was brought back on the project once more to expand the film into the vision Lucas had originally envisioned.  While all three films were to be \\"touched up\\" for the 20 year anniversary release, it was \\"A New Hope\\" that was given the biggest facelift.  Scenes that had been cut were re-introduced to the film, new scenes, with the aid of some cutting edge CGI were created, and the film as a whole was retouched, enhancing the color and sound through the use of digital processing.<br />The movie opened with much of the same hype as it had 20 years earlier.  Storylines, which had been developed in \\"the Empire Strikes Back\\" and \\"The Return of the Jedi\\" were fleshed out some in this first film, and for the first time, we saw the famous scene where Han has his initial run-in with Jabba the Hutt (a scene that was omitted in the original release due to a lack of effects technology to create the slug-like Jabba).  Additional sequences included a greatly enhanced Mos-Eisley spaceport, full of droids, strange alien lifeforms and a barrage of businesses and settlements that gave the city a much greater scope than the original.<br />Similar additions were created for the sequels, though most of the revision work there surrounding the enhancement of exisitng scenes.  As with \\"New Hope\\", the films were cleaned up, providing new digital effects where blue screen and miniatures had been used previously.  The changes, more subtle than the first, are still impressive, especially the altered ending to \\"The Return of the Jedi.\\"  Though this reviewer will not ruin the ending for the viewer, lets simply state that there will no longer be a need to suffer through the Ewoks song that seemed sadly anti-climatic at the end of the original release of the film.<br />The special effects in these films play more like characters than situations, and ILM has done a great job of cleaning them up.  Especially impressive are the new fight/flight sequences at the end of \\"A New Hope\\" when the Rebel Alliance is engaged with the Empire with the intent of destroying the Death Star.  The new visuals, which were blended in many cases with existing effects, are much more fluid, providing a greater sense of reality to the viewer.<br />For anyone unfamiliar with the story surrounding the Star Wars franchise, it begins with a farmboy named Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill), whose greatest dream is to be a pilot in the Imperial Fleet.  When his uncle purchases a pair of droids for their farm, he uncovers a secret message recorded by the beautiful Princess Leia Organa (Carrie Fisher) for the mysterious Jedi Knight, Obi-Wan (Ben) Kenobi (Alec Guiness), which begins a string of events that will forever change Luke's life.  With the aid of rogue pilot Han Solo (Harrison Ford) and Chewbacca, Ben and Luke, along with C-3P0 (Anthony Daniels) and R2-D2, head out to Alderan where they hope to aid the rebel alliance in overthrowing the Empire by destroying the Emperor's most lethal weapon, the dreaded Death Star; a spacestation capable of destroying entire planets.  Upon their arrival,they run head-long into the Death Star, which has recently destroyed the planet of Alderan, Leia's homeworld.  Their ship captured, the crew escape capture with the aid of Han's smuggling compartments built into the floor of his ship.  They set out into the Death Star to rescue the princess, dis-engage the tractor beam and ultimately return to the secret base of the Rebel Alliance.  Kenobi, whose actions differ some, sets out to confront Darth Vader (David Prowse (voiced by James Earl Jones)), ambassador to the Emporer and former pupil of Kenobi.  <br />The balance of the story, and the sequels, are for the viewer to discover.  These films, which have been digitally transfered to video cassette in both wide screen and full screen editions, are spectacular, with a clarity of sound and color that is better than any other release of the films to date.  The extras on the video cassette are sparse, save for a three-part \\"Making Of\\" serving as an introduction to each of the films.  Narrated most by Leonard Maltin (film critic) and George Lucas, these introductions to offer a good glimpse into the process Lucas and his sizable staff undertook in the re-creation of the many sequences in each film.<br />As the original Star Wars Trilogy is not yet available on DVD, this collection is probably the closest transfer in existance of these films to a digital video.  The videos are clean, with enhanced sound and color that really do make the movies seem as if they were brand new, instead of a re-release of a film that is over 20 years old.  The additions to each of the film are enjoyable, though some look contrived, especially the sequences surrounding Vader's return to his Star Destroyer at the end of \\"The Empire Strikes Back\\". (You will note that the general who meets him at the end of Empire is the same as the one who greets him at the beginning of \\"Jedi\\".  It would seem that Lucas spliced some spare footage from \\"Jedi\\" into \\"Empire\\" to expand the scene.)  <br />Though many critics complain that the films should not have been doctored, the extended edition nonetheless does offer up a fresh look for the films and, for the uninitiated, the closest opportunity available to experiencing the Star Wars franchise the way it was seen when it first packed the theaters in 1977.  These films have stood the test of time, and now, with the release of all three in this collector's edition, are a worthwhile addition to any video library.<br />-Scott Kolecki
B00007AJF8|2.0|Not good at all<br />I was expecting \\"Being John Malkovich\\" to be a sort of trippy ride like \\"Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas\\"  but I must say that I much prefer the later in terms of screen madness and insanity. BJM does stall a lot of the time and there are many dull moments in-between the bouts of lunacy. I certainly prefer the director's latest work \\"Adaptation\\" to this vehicle.<br />This film revolves around a puppeteer who manages to find a portal through a door in an office into John Malkovich's head. What a great premise! This boasts of originality through and through. Sounds just like what we need. I was really looking forward to this one. I like little cult items that do things differently.<br />However this is really a very mixed bag. You can tell that a lot of people in this movie are here to help out a friend. Some actors take their role a way more seriously than others. There is a lot of diversity in the quality there. I guess the reason why people went to see this film was to see Hollywood go wacky. It does just that, but is a tad bit embarrassingly executed as if you are watching the actors pour out their hearts on the Jerry Springer show. That is certainly not my kettle of fish. Maybe you will like this and I am sure that there are many people who simply adore this film but that was strike one for me. I do not like that sort of thing because it makes me feel uncomfortable to be honest and I found it hard to enjoy anything after that. I have read other reviewers here who did not like the film because of this either.<br />Strike two for me was the fact that the film's premise is limited to this \\"nutty\\" concept. It does not go outside of it much and when it does it can get extremely boring. The relationships in this movie are not fleshed out. When the divergence in acting quality meets up outside of its core theme the movie does falter into the realm of amateur film making. This can be forgiven for the director's newness but it is, frankly, boring.<br />The third Strike came in the form of a dud presentation. This is just NOT THAT WACKY. It does not get much crazy outside of the theme of going into Malkovich's head. A lot of it is simply executed in some way or another to look strange, but it just LOOKS strange and is not that cerebral at all. I expected this film to mess with your mind a bit more but it does not really do that. It just looks wacky but does not execute much intelligence along the way. Ultimately this is a bore.<br />However I will give it Charlie Sheen who saves this movie from one star purgatory. This vehicle is worth seeing for his performance alone. Overall this is \\"designer mainstream Hollywood wackiness\\" that can play to all audiences but is certainly devoid of making that extra leap of the consciousness that it pretends to expound on. This is no 2001 or Jacobs Ladder or Lost Highway. This is more akin to a dark version of a Police Squad movie. Not my idea of a wacky film, but a lot of people might like it and this review should not put you off trying it. I just did not like it at all and felt letdown by it all. It certainly does not live up to the hype for me for the reasons I have stated above. IMO, watch &quot;Adaptation&quot; instead.>The third Strike came in the form of a dud presentation.

B000002UDD|5.0|This is a great Megadeth album despite what others may say.  Some say that Peace Sells... and Rust in Peace are better and in some aspects they may be right.  I have also heard people cut the album to pieces because of all of that reverb in the mix, which personally i don't mind one bit.  This album has a bunch of really awesome songs so don't miss out just cause you have heard bad things!<br />INTO THE LUNGS OF HELL- Cool song and great intro and you can definatly imagine falling into the lungs of hell once the song picks up speed.  I wouldn't say that it is as cool as say \\"Orion\\" on Master of Puppets but it isn't bad. B-<br />SET THE WORLD AFIRE- Very fast and heavy and one of my favorites.  Also a bunch of cool riffs in this one. A/A+<br />ANARCHY IN THE U.K.-I also don't know why nobody likes this one, half this album sounds like punk stuff anyways, jeeezz! C+( only cause it is a cover)<br />MARY JANE- I have a hard time deciding if this one or if  \\"In My Darkest Hour\\" is my favorite song on this album.  Very very cool riffing, guitar harmonies, and solo.  This whole song is great. A+<br />502-In my opinion this is the worst song on the album, no memorable riffs and the lyrics are really stupid. D<br />IN MY DARKEST HOUR- What a great piece of music this is!  The riffs, fast soloing,  and how the song speeds up at the end(kind of like \\"One\\" by Metallica).  Everyone seems to like this one the best.  A+<br />LIAR-  This one sounds punkish for sure.  But that doesn't me it isn't good.  The lyrics can be funny at times.  Simple but to the point.  A-<br />HOOK IN MOUTH-  This might be the heaviest song on the album because of the opening riff.  This song also has some strange but cool guitar leads.  Lyrics are very good too, it might not seems so with the coach roach in the concrete line but keep listening. A
0385504209|5.0|This was the first book I've read by Dan Brown and I loved it. It took me less than a week to finish it. Whether or not everything was historically accurate to the letter wasn't important to me-rather, I found the ideas presented to be intriguing, even if some literary license was used.<br />Any open-minded person will enjoy this book. However, if you are close-minded and not open to different interpretations of religious doctrine, don't read this book-it will only upset you.<br />I'm already reading my second D. Brown novel, Angels and Demons, and can hardly put it down.
B00005AQE8|5.0|I don't care what anybody tells you, this is, by far, the greatest hip-hop CD ever released. ( Besides greatest hits CD's ) CD's like this is why Tupac is so highly revered. BIG was an awesome emcee, but never had a release this perfect. I don't know if anybody will ever dethrone this champion of a Cd in my eyes.
B00005JKCH|5.0|The best thing about Spider-Man is the fact that Hollywood has managed to catch Sam Raimi properly and stick him with a better budget. He does have a string of well made movies behind him (Evil Dead, A Simple Plan, Darkman, The Gift) but nothing that says he can handle a Summer Blockbuster movie. However his resume does speak volumes about his trek through the world of superheros and the supernatural and so deservingly and rewardingly they have allowed this man to finally spin a golden celluloid web of mystery, intrigue, action and dark justice.<br />Spider-Man is the first foray for the new \\"Marvel\\" co-production team. Here they have managed to pick up a fan boy director who is committed to translating a comic book hero onto the screen. Not only that but he is also translating a whole comic book onto the screen. Fans, of both Raimi and Spider-man, should feel very happy with the final result.<br />This film is about the character Peter Parker as much as it is about Spider-Man (Great casting and played to form by Tobey Maguire although I think Jason Patrick would make a good older version of Spider-Man.). Here we see him acquiring his skills, learning his skills and then finally using them. The movie takes almost one hour to get cooking in the Spider-Man vs Bad Guys department, but you do not care because much of what is on display here is a good old fashioned teenage drama about the short-comings of adulthood, love and geekness. Parker, his family, his school friends and his wanna-be-girlfriend are all fully fleshed out. Much of it matches with the reality we live in and it is all played out very realistically and at times with lots of humour. However when Spider-Man turns dark, and it does turn dark, it is very twisted, emotionally challenging and does swing between that fine line of lynch mob revenge and real justice.<br />The premise is simple but complex in the execution. Kid gets bit by radioactive spider, transforms into superhero, meets an anti-superhero (The Goblin) with similar problems who wants revenge for crimes committed against him by the government. Where Spider-Man scores in aces is with the fact that the two Superheros know each other well but do not know each others alter ego. This makes for an emotionally charged ending when all is finally unmasked.<br />Spider-Man does suffer some setbacks. The budget is not quite as high as expected and the special effects can be a little lacklustre at times, however expertly done at other times. The special effects here are hit or miss and at times do look like the CGI we had seen back in the early 1990s.<br />However all of this can be panned aside quickly by the sheer display of action and acting with all... and I mean ALL... that this genre can offer with ample amounts of family values and teenage dilemmas. There is even a final shot of a half-masked Spider-Man where Parker is a reflection of his torn self proving that this character carries lots of psychological fun to boot.<br />This actually has a way more depth that you would expect and to its credit the character department is expertly handled.<br />**As a note the action in the film transcends its PG-13 rating. The action is at times extremely violent and somewhat bloody. In fact the ending is closer to an R rating but because this is fantasy violence in the same vein as Lord of the Rings it gets the PG-13, but maybe pre-viewing by concerned parents should be adopted before showing it to their kids.**e Goblin) with similar problems who wants revenge for crimes committed against him by the government.

B000059ZT4|5.0|Classic reggae from the best &quot;supergroup&quot; there ever was.  Unfortunately, the real star of the group, Peter Tosh, never got his due but in some ways Bob's starpower is a tribute to him, for he taught Bob guitar and songwriting.  While Bob was more affable and appealing Tosh's message and music are simply genius and indeed prophetic.  No, the world won't have peace until ALL have &quot;equal rights and justice&quot;.
B000089RVR|5.0|It took a bit for &quot;Life for Rent&quot; to grow on me, especially since I first listened to it after reading several negative reviews.  Not much different in style from her debut, but there's nothing wrong with that, IMO.  She has a style which is instantly recognizable after just a few notes.  That's her staple, so there is no reason to change, despite that common criticism I hear.<br />1) White Flag - I did not find this special at all the first few times I heard it.  I was afraid that if this was the first single, I had a lot to worry about if I was expecting something special overall.  I was wrong.  This song is so engrained in me, and is quite special.  It just needs the chance to attach itself to your soul.<br />2) Stoned - Although the way this song starts out leads you to wonder where it's going to end up, it quickly became one of my favorites.  I love the driving, flowing chorus, and it just builds and builds.  Addicting.<br />3) Life For Rent - Very pretty title track.<br />4) Mary's In India - It took me a while to warm to this beautiful song.  Just let it flow with your eyes closed.<br />5) See You When You're 40 - Another one which to me a while to warm up to.  Very atmospheric.<br />6) Don't Leave Home - One of my favorites, and one I liked right away.  I love the rhythm of this one.  This should definitely be a single.  It's one of her best.<br />7) Who Makes You Feel - I know there's a song in here somewhere, but I'm too distracted by everything else that's <BR>going on.  I skip this occassionally, but I'm trying.<br />8) Sand In My Shoes - Very different from the rest of the album, but fabulous.  A great pop song.  Also should be a <BR>single, and a huge hit.  If there isn't one yet, there should be a club mix of this.<br />9) Do You Have A Little Time - Not one of my favorites.  Sounds a bit dark.  Not that I don't like dark -- I do.  But this just doesn't do it for me.<br />10) This Land Is Mine - Although it's a nice song, it reminds me of the feeling I have about &quot;Thank You&quot; -- the verses are great, but the chorus lets me down a bit -- too generic.<br />11) See The Sun - Maybe my favorite on the album, and a great way to end it.  A sweeping, atmospheric, emotional punctuation mark on a great sophmore effort.<br />Overall, I'd give this 4.5 stars (c'mon, Amazon, it's about time you let us rate like that!).  I had to round up, because it wasn't fair to round down.<br />Highly recommended!
B00005JMTN|4.0|Tim Burton is an acquired taste. His flights of fancy and flourishes of eccentric style make him one of the most divisive directors in cinema today. Big Fish, the director's latest, is actually half Burtonian and half family drama. When the images and occurrences are larger than life, the film zips along with plenty of eye candy to sweeten one's taste buds. When the film lurches into the dramatic, the pace flags despite solid acting and a story that's a step or two away from touching. On the whole, because it is so uneven, the two-hour film feels overlong in spite of all the pieces being in place for greatness. <br />Edward Bloom (Albert Finney) is a man who loves to tell tall tales about his life experiences. His energetic delivery and unmitigated exuberance leave his audiences, disbelieving though they may be, uniformly rapt. That is, except for his son William Bloom (Billy Crudup), a straight-laced reporter who feels that he has lived his entire life without ever knowing the truth of his father. Upon hearing about Edward's impending death, after three years of silence between the two, William travels to his father's bedside with his pregnant wife in tow. There, in Edward's final days, William tries to finally break through the fairy tale facade he's always lived with to understand the stranger he calls dad. <br />Though Edward is weak, he can't resist spinning stories to his son's French bride. The film traces Edward's life as a young man this way, featuring Ewan McGregor as the young wanderer. This is probably McGregor's best performance to date, because even though Moulin Rouge is a superior film, this role is more focused on acting and a pure emotional connection with the audience. McGregor succeeds on both counts, creating an extremely likeable and always fascinating character to observe. It is a testament to the quality of his performance that he is never overshadowed by the oddball characters he comes across. <br />And speaking of oddball characters, Burtonreally shows his stuff when young Edward is traversing Alabama. The impressive array of people he meets includes a giant named Karl, a one-eyed witch (Burton's real-life love Helena Bonham Carter), Japanese Siamese twins, a swarthy old-time carny (Danny DeVito with a wavering Southern accent) and the bare-footed residents of the idyllic town Spectre. This portion of the film includes a haunted forest, a prophetic glass eye and more fantastical fun. Undoubtedly the strongest portion of the film, these flashbacks are both beautiful and energizing. <br />Tim Burton, who reportedly had a rocky relationship with his father, found his a very personal project and cannot be blamed for turning on the sentimental waterworks near the end of the film. However, after having so much fun with Ewan McGregor, the viewer doesn't want to shed a tear with a dying old man and his stuffy son. Our reluctance to accept the film's tonal shift probably explains why Big Fish isn't as moving as the recent Monster and House of Sand and Fog are. The film is pulling in two different directions at once, and invariably, the weaker side ends up being dragged in the dust. <br />Big Fish is certainly worth seeing, and if the personal connection is there for you, it may work as well as it obviously hopes to. For me, the happy-go-lucky filmgoer, I would have traded the hour or so of Finney/Crudup for a half-hour more of Ewan. After all, if you aren't going to a Burton film for magic, why bother going at all? <br />Final Grade: B+
B00003CWRX|5.0|Tobacco courtroom fraud does not seem like an exciting motion picture film to make and certainly the idea of corporate fatheads eating up all the capitalism they can manage is just a state of reality that one can sympathise with but also feel that people are ultimately responsible for their own actions and nobody is forcing the products down their throats. It seems that Michael Mann would have a lot to go up against here if he wanted to prove that self-inflicted harm is someone elses responsibility. Mann does not avoid this element but he does aim his direction more at corporate employee suppression, the impact that their testimony may have on society, the importance of the freedom of speech, how the media can be manipulated and the influence on government and state sector lobbying.<br />This is a very intelligent movie that brings one mans quest to do battle with the giants into sharp contrast with the stark reality of its lunacy, shortcomings and psychological affects that is has on a family and ones life in general. At times this picture is extremely deep and moving. It is also equally complex, controversial and conspires. Maybe repeat viewings are needed to capture all of its intricacy and involvedness with the real world corporate scandal scene.<br />Russell Crowe plays Dr. Jeffrey Wigand, a scientist with a heart who believes that the tobacco giants he worked for perjured themselves in a court of law when they said that they believed that tobacco was not addictive. Wigand believes that while he worked for these companies that he was asked to develop a chemical system by which nicotine would be administered to the brain, through smoking, more quickly and effectively. He takes his story to CBSs 60 minutes producer Lowell Bergman (Al Pacino) and this starts a chain reaction where the corporate fatheads proceed to suppress him, the CBS show and resort to unconditional threats and exploitation of the mans family that even involves manipulating the police services. The bottom line here - Money is Power.... but so are some other things.<br />This is not all good guys vs bad guys stuff. At times Wigand comes across as a really gruff and stuck-up chemist with a grudge. Bergman, for all his interest and want to tell a good story, is also ultimately just a reporter who wants to be the one behind presenting the facts to the American public. Bergmans story is just as interesting as Wigands. Wigand finds himself heavily suppressed by the corporate sector to the point where he is escorted to the courts under armed guard. Bergman finds himself, and his career, ruined by corporate-CBS who have final say over what they can or can not air.<br />This is all good stuff and makes for remarkable viewing. It is very long, drawn out but never dull and does transcend its narrow theme to incorporate much more about the real world than just its corporate scandals. This is the kind of film that you would like to see Hollywood do more. It is brainy, thoughtful and thoroughly satisfying. It is also based on a true story. The film itself attracted some hullabaloo from the tobacco giants in question.<br />Anybody can enjoy this film. It is a tense drama and certainly you will hard-pressed not to like it. If you are looking for a worthy and worldly reason for a drama then you do not have to look much further than The Insider.<br />Great Cinema. Bold Filmmaking.ing the police services.

B00006M183|3.0|Riot Act is a rather boring und uninspiring piece of work for the reference class PJ once set with outstanding classics like Ten or Vs. In my point of view after Ten and Vs their level of aspiration and vigor was constantly dropping. They might have developed in an artistic way, weaving more intricate sound carpets. But thats not the overall criteria for rock music, which always raised its authentic power from raw simplicity. <br />Of course PJ are still highly skilled musicians, but I think their touch for writing outstanding songs has suffered through the years. <br />So in general Riot Act is one of the most mediocre and average albums of PJ. &quot;Love Boat Captain&quot; is an all time low. One exception should be mentioned: &quot;I am mine&quot; is a great song, which reminds me of the glory days a decade ago and gives hope for future project (and justifies 3 points, without I would have voted for only 2 points).<br />Bottom line: The PC attitude of PJ somehow spoils good rock music. PJ might listen to the lyrics of &quot;We care a lot&quot; from FNM to gain a more self-ironic approach to their work.

B00006G8G1|4.0|I saw Maiden in 2000 on this Brave New World Tour.  They were phenomenal!  This DVD is my personal souvenir from that tour.  The band kill on this DVD.  The video quality and audio is first rate.  The extras are decent but not impressive.  My only gripe is the editing of this concert.  If you don't take your eyes off of it, you'll feel nauseous after awhile.  It is so choppy, and Steve Harris didn't leave one camera still for longer than 5 seconds!!!  It's way to much and too choppy.  Other than that, no other complaints.
6305252521|5.0|I have never been a huge fan of Jim Carrey movies, so when The Truman Show came out, I quickly wrote it off as not one I was going to rush out to see. I shouldn't have. Fortunately, I got the chance to see it at a friend's house, and I can honestly say that it left me speechless and amazed at the brilliance of the film. First of all, Jim Carrey excells in this role. I find him to be a very funny man in real life, but his wacky roles in previous movies (Ace Ventura, Dumb & Dumber...you know them) don't appeal to me at all. BUT, in this role, he shows that he is way more than a go-to weirdo or funnyman. The emotion and the vulnerability he brings to the naive Truman Burbank only improves as the movie goes on. Watching this man crack as the only world he knows begins to slowly betray him and the intensity of his attempts to discover what else is beyond his hidden cage is moving in a way that few movies can convey successfully.<br />This movie is more than just about watching Truman Burbank find out the truth of his televised life, but it is a stunning portrayal of humanity. Truman's world was created by Christof (the always wonderful Ed Harris) to be what is considered \\"perfection.\\" Christof is like God in the Seahaven world. He makes every choice for the world, including the weather and even Truman's fears...but Christof cannot change the one thing that noone can manipulate--Truman's thoughts. Truman is given the perfect wife, a brotherly bestfriend, a steady job, and a life in a world that exists without pain, sadness, or evil. But the world is a cage. The movie shows that stability is not perfection, ignorance is not bliss, and a life without ALL emotions--including sadness, fear, and pain--could never exist. Even without knowing that he is trapped, Truman feels the need to escape his \\"perfect\\" life and to see what else there is beyond the utopia that is Seahaven Island. It is a perfect display of our quest for the unknown, unsatisfaction with just mundane existence, and our interest in what normality really is.<br />When you watch this movie, you will become just like the viewers in the movie who are watching Truman. You will root for him, cry for him, and laugh with (or at) him. His is truly a reality show that I hope that never is created for real...but we ARE humans, so who knows how we'll try to play God next...<br />P.S. The score to the movie is absolutely gorgeous.e, and our interest in what normality really is. <br />When you watch this movie, you will become just like the viewers in the movie who are watching Truman.

B00006BTCA|1.0|A star is born and they shall be named Interpol. Actually they took their name directly from the International Criminal Police Organization. BUT LET'S JUST IGNORE THAT FOR THE TIME BEING.<BR>We have now, walking among us a few bright lights. They are here to turn us on. Turn us on to their incredibly creative and unique sound. These incredible astute and brilliant young men have blessed us with the ability to form an original sound, which dazzle us to blindness by the virtual brilliances of their being. Actually they took their sound directly from a number of Post-Punk champions like Joy Division, The Smiths, Psychedelic Furs, Echo and the Bunneymen and more. BUT LET'S JUST IGNORE THAT FOR THE TIME BEING.<BR>They began with a sly campaign to expose us to their creation by offering their CD at a low price for the first year after it was released. Once they started breaking through into the thoughts and minds of the population at large, they realized their CD sales were starting to increase, so they responded by...what else?...increasing the price to take advantage of their newest fans. For isn't that a fair and equitable way of treating the people who spend their hard earned dollars on your creations? BUT LET'S JUST IGNORE THAT FOR THE TIME BEING.<BR>Actually I'm not going to bother writing anything else because Interpol offers nothing of value. So I'm going to take my own advice and JUST IGNORE THEM.
0887307280|2.0|This book provided some good insight into common business assumptions.  Gerber has some good points, but had trouble putting them into a book.  The dialogue was forced, dull, and extremely repetitive.  This book could use a lot of editing.<br />The book seemed more like a sales pitch for his company.  He listed all the pros of his methods and beliefs, but didn't address any negatives.  His fictional character Sarah left the impression she would believe anything he said.  Why doesn't she question anything he suggests?  She just bought into everything he said. <br />Did McDonald's pay him to write this book?
1573301183|5.0|I do not need to even get into details.  This DVD performance is so important to the Alice in Chains legacy.  Also, it is perhaps the most meanful MTV Unplugged release of them all.  Layne is at his tormented best, so deep in pain, you get chills just hearing him sing.  Oh so sad, but yet he makes it sound so sweet and beautiful.  Jerry is just equal to Layne, never adding too much nor taking much away.  Layne and Jerry I think are the last great dou to emerge from the whole 90's rock explosion.  Get this DVD, all you need to do is love music, not even be a fan of AIC's, just love music.  Put this DVD in your player, push play, then close your eyes.  Let me know how you feel afterwards.
B0000640VO|5.0|Amelie is a wonderful allegorical story with breathtaking cinematography.  This is a wonderful ensemble cast with strong character development throughout.  This is a movie that you hate to see end while watching just like reading a great book and finding yourself at the end and thinking &quot;now what?&quot;... Audrey Tautou is MESMERIZING without saying a word.  Her facial/body movements are haunting and she develops an &quot;otherworldly/angelic&quot; character in Amelie.  The two disc DVD with featurettes are a wonderful addition and takes you into Amelie's world... Can't say enough good things about this movie.  Don't be a lazy bum of a person JUST BECAUSE you must read the yellow subtitles, you FLOUNDERS!  You won't be disappointed!  :&gt;)
B00006BTCA|1.0|IAN CURTIS WAS A ROCK GOD and nobody but his family and band members should be allowed to make money from his creations. <BR>Interpol are a talented bunch of kids with good taste in music who should have directed their talent into creating something new instead of RIPPING OFF JOY DIVISION! <BR>Hopefully the talent they show with TOTBL develops, and that with maturity they will find their own voice. I've got my fingered crossed for them. <BR>But in the end I completely agree with the one reviewer - If you want to hear Joy Division, listen to Joy Division!
0446608955|5.0|A Walk to Remember written by Nicholas Sparks had touched every single heart. With it's romance it had made me see my love ones more precious. I really like the way Nicholas Sparks had arranged the order of the story, which build me to cry again and again. Another special thing was that this story is unpredictable. I didn't know that Landon was going to change his life upon a woman he fell in love with. This book had changed me in many ways. I had become a girl who sees things in a better way more then before and I appreciate every moments of my life. The way Jamie had treated other and look at the world in a beautiful way had impressed me and motivated me to be a better person.
B000066NW0|3.0|Following in the footsteps of Alanis M., Avril Lavigne's debut album \\"Let Go\\" proves to be an unwilling sacrifice of defiancy and voice.  Tracks like \\"Complicated\\", \\"Sk8r Boi\\", and \\"My World\\" are obvious signs of an act of being different, yet Avril still manages to have the same questions running through peoples minds. Has she overdone it?<br />The album produces strong songs like \\"Losing Grip\\", Unwanted\\", and \\"Nobodys Fool\\", but still it causes a drousy affect toward the end of the album.  The beginning is very interesting, but many closing songs (i.e: \\"Anything But Ordinary\\", \\"Too Much To Ask\\", \\"My World\\" and \\"Nobodys Fool\\") are compiled to an affect of repeatingness.  Her voice also is very lowed down during nearly all of the songs, which doesnt help the case of the songs sounding different.<br />Though Avril has shown she has the ability to maintain stayingness, \\"Let Go\\" falls short of defining anything.  Its mostly her personality that is doing that job.  Overall, Avril serves up some intrest, but mostly recycled pop-rock storylines and light, head filling closers.<br />Losing Grip: 4/5<br />Complicated: 5/5<br />Sk8er Boi: 4/5<br />Im With You: 4/5<br />Mobile: 3/5<br />Unwanted: 3.5/5<br />Tomorrow: 2.5/5<br />Anything But Ordinary: 2.5/5<br />Things Ill Never Say: 3/5<br />My World: 2.5/5<br />Nobodys Fool: 3/5<br />Too Much To Ask: 2.5/5<br />Naked: 3/5

B0000DZEE3|5.0|This is the best dvd i have saw. I bought it together with the coldplay dvd and the new dave matthews and i cant watch another dvd but this red hot one. John Frusciante is marvellous on stage, Flea is great and anthony and Chad are real good but Frusciante is the real thing. He sings like and angel and he palys like one too. It is amazing. If you never watched it. Buy it now! And listen to the venice queen song. Best backing vocal in history. <BR>A M A Z I N G ! ! ! ! !
0226264211|4.0|Respectfully Dr. Friedman, you are a world known scholar and an intellect, and I lay claim to neither.  But nonetheless I find myself in disagreement to some of your opinions; perhaps a result from my limited knowledge.  In the first chapter you meticulously detail the direct relation between increased economic prosperity to greater personal freedom. This view certainly holds true to the western world; but a broader look into Asian countries show a contrary picture. At first United Arab Emirates (GNP per capita $20,000),<BR>Kuwait (GNP per capita $24,000), Singapore (GNP per capita $27,000) have strict restrictions on personal freedom and are ruled by an absolute monarch. The said countries have economic indicators comparable to the countries in the west as United States of America (GNP per capita $30,000), United Kingdom (GNP per capita $20,883) and Spain (GNP per capita $16,700). On the other spectrum India with an instilled democratic state for the last 50 years has its economic indicators comparable to a third world nation (GNP per capita $2140). <br />Further along the reading you profess the need for smaller governments; with lesser intrusion from the government into the workings of a free market. But I feel disheartened that even with the government interventions there have been cases of utmost corruption in the corporate arena e.g. Enron, Martha Stewart. In the same breath I feel that with minimal government intervention we would eliminate the spirit of a free market; as corporations like Microsoft and Intel would in a flash wipe out their smaller competitors and create a monopoly.  <br />In your suggestion for the elimination of minimal wages; are guarantees that the workers at the lower end of the scale are not left further in poverty. With no such barriers there would be a greater glut of cheap labor ready to work at lower wages. This creates an endemic of poverty and social/society ill-will. In addition I believe in the utter greed of capitalist who would pressurize the congress to allow more cheap labor for them to fatten their pockets. At present the economic divide is significant; I feel with the elimination of minimum wages would create a greater disparity.<br />The concept of providing parents with the vouchers is a great idea; at present being adapted by President Bush with the program \\"No child left behind\\"; but steps need to be ensured that the vouchers are only provided to lower income families.  As the system can be abused by kids already going to private schools getting subsides for their education.  <br />I find it difficult to comprehend your belief to unilaterally eliminate trade barriers. This gives a great edge to foreign competitors to move in their products. This would be comforting for the consumers; but placed at the expense of increased trade deficits. I believe the elimination of trade barriers not unilaterally but in a multilateral approach.
B00008PW2D|1.0|I bought this for my wife for Christmas. She already has the other 4 seasons. I thought there was a mistake with the DVD since there were only 2 discs. I would NEVER have bought this if I had known I was only getting half a season for full price.<BR>8 shows for $35? That is only 4 hours of material. HBO should be ashamed of themselves!<BR>I'm not a big fan of the show but I have seen all the other seasons and thought they were OK. I can't even get through the first disc on season 5.
B00009TB5G|5.0|My life has been saved by this magical rollercoaster of a film! I have read everything by Tolkien ( except all that academic stuff he REALLY wanted to be remembered for)and I just live for this stuff! I even wish and dream of the day whem my fantasy novel gets made into a movie! I am a 35 year old writer of novels and I can only hope that my 1000000 page book will make such a wonderfull film!<br />This film SAVED my life! This film gave millions of people just like Me a reason to get up in the morning. Not to mention that The Lord of The Rings provided me with an excuse for social interaction. Yes, this is more than just a film folks, it is A WAY OF LIFE! Before this film I was nobody-now I am on a fantastic quest of my own! I WILL become the next Tolkien!!I might even get some of my buddies together and go on my own magical, mystical journey! Zooooom-a-loom! I have the power!<br />Everyone MUST see these films. They are not only the best that the world of cinema has to offer, but they are essential for helping mankind see his destiny! Yes folks they are THAT good. Now, if I could only meet a nice elve/gnome/hobbit woman to walk hand-in-hand with through this magical, mystical and fantastical universe! Is my princess out there? Maybe, Tolkien films and books lead to failure with the opposite sex? That's what my doctor says anyway. What does he know anyway? It's not like he is a wizard or anything!<br /> Now, please excuse me, I have to crawl back into the fort that I made out of blankets underneath my parent's stairs.
0061015725|3.0|The terrors and pitfalls of nanotechnology are endless and far-reaching, and Crichton uses this to good advantage.  The frequent explanations along the way, which some have said are dry and academic, to me added to the suspense, making the swarms of nanobots all the more frightening.  These nanobots are so real, in fact, that they threaten to overshadow the cardboard characters and formulaic plot (this science-run-amok template goes all the way back to FRANKENSTEIN).  The characters are uninteresting and, in order for the plot to move along, they make some stupid mistakes so that the 'bots can get the upper hand (the main character, in fact, is so passive in the face of deception that he could just as well be sleep-walking).  Then, at the end, the 'bots make some stupid mistakes for the plot to come to its conclusion.  Read it for the science, not the story.<br />This novel brought to mind similar, better, novels:  A. A. Merritt's THE METAL MONSTER, Poul Anderson's BRAIN WAVE, Dean Koontz's PHANTOMS, and the novel MUTANT 59: THE PLASTIC EATERS.
B000002UDD|5.0|The only thing I have to say about this disc is wow. Although knocked for somewhat sub par recording quality the overall adrenealine and angriness of the album makes it a smart buy. Favorite tracks Set the World Afire (Megadeth's first song written shortly after Dave was booted from that crappy band whose name I can't remember), Into the Lungs of Hell (Kickass instrumental), Hook in Mouth (My personal favorite, lot of raw agression and fast as hell) and of course the eerie In My Darkest Hour (A tribute to the late and great Cliff Burton, who made that band what they used to be).  If the quality gets you however, later this year it will be reissued, remixed and remastered with possible unreleased material...you might want to wait.
B00008OLYN|4.0|If you want to get into Opeth, i do NOT suggest you get this album. I love it, but it takes time to get used to it. To Rid the Disease, Closure, and Windowpane are my favorite tracks. If you love the hard, metal Opeth... this album is not for you. If you love all sides of Opeth, i suggest you buy this.
B0000C6E4D|5.0|You must give this new one a listen.  I think this a very consistent cd from start to finish, unlike Sarah McLachlan's others.  I can only find one song I skip once in a while.  The first three songs are some of her best and every time I listen to World on Fire it sends chills down my spine.  This is a very moody cd, as are her others, but I really think this was worth the wait.  The only disappointment is that there was not more material (10 songs is rather limited these days when most artist pack 12-16 songs), and that she wouldn't sign my copy when she was in Baltimore.
B00009TB5G|5.0|I'm not going to get bore you with details, I will say that the Lord of the Rings series is the best Trilogy ever made ( next to the original Star Wars !)The opening sequence in this movie is one of the most incredible things ever to be on screen! If you love the Sci-Fi/Fantasy Genre then you must own this extended DVD<br />The quality is the best, sound is awesome, and the extras are awesome! I can't wait for Return of the King to come out on DVD!
B00006879E|5.0|This release is fantastic and then some!  You cannot pin down the band's exact style since their music is so original, and basically consists of various rock, funk, soul, and pop elements that gel perfectly in their songs.  There is good music out there still.  You just have to search a bit.  Lately, I can't stop playing Maroon 5 and this other great great CD called 'Me Died Blue' by this awesome singer/songwriter artist named Steven Delopoulos from the New Jersey shore.  I would have to say that these 2 artists have taken over my CD player over the last few months!  I hope to be able to catch them both live soon.
0385504209|2.0|just written for slower folks, with all interesting mind fodder removed. I disagree with some of the other reviews stating this is a total ripoff.... even within the text Brown acknowledges that all of these ideas are old hat and have been for at least decades. As my title indicates, however, Umberto Eco was able to weave the old legends of the Templars into a much more relevant and poignant work. Besides, with Bush's current fantasia of rationales for provoking illegal wars, the nature of truth as elucidated in Foucault's Pendulum is much more pertinent.
0783226845|5.0|HOOOOOO WA!!! I'm the biggest Al Pacino fan and I own all his DVDs including this one. This film goes beyond his normal mobster/ cops roles and portrays him as a desperate lonely blind man at the end of his rope. Chris O' Donnell who I think was made famous by this film, helps Pacino discover the beauties of life. Watch this film and you will see how brilliant Pacino is. It will move you and inspire you a million times over. I watched this film 100s of times so many times i cant remember. Its so perfect. Watch it and be amazed. Hollywood finally finally after 20 some odd years and 7 Oscar nominations gave Pacino his well deserved Oscar for Best Actor in 1993. I think he should have won for The Godfather in 1972 but its all good. This film showed some of his greatest acting. AL PACINO IS THE GREATEST ACTOR IN THE WORLD!!!!!! BUY THIS MOVIE AND YOU WILL SEE WHAT I MEAN !!!
0385504209|3.0|Anytime a book gets as much attention as 'The DaVinci Code', I feel compelled to read it. I think the real reason this book has taken off like wildfire is that most people AREN'T familiar with 'Holy Blood, Holy Grail'. This is a historically researched book dealing with the same subjects which Dan Brown basically pirated for his novel. The difference between them is, that truth in this case is stranger and MORE interesting than fiction. The characters in 'The DaVinci Code' were wooden, the plotlines about Opus Dei were awkward, and Dan Brown has an EXTREMELY ANNOYING habit of making every other sentence an italicized thought! It got really cumbersome when I first started reading the novel and became more and more cartoon-like until I gratefully reached page 454.... Another historical book dealing with the same subject matter is called 'Rennes La Chateau' and again the true subject of Berenger Saunier --- a priest who found a mysterious treasure in southern France using clues found in the paintings of Poussin is worlds more interesting and engrossing than Brown's flimsy fictional attempt at it's exploitation.
B00006V9A0|5.0|This is a truly wonderful collection of Nirvana's most famous songs. All of the radio hits are here (Smells Like Teen Spirit, Lithium, Heart Shaped Box), but the real treats are the remix of Pennyroyal Tea and the new previously unreleased track &quot;You Know You're Right&quot;. For these two tracks alone, this CD is worth buying. It's true that there is room for about 30 minutes of more songs (such as Territorial Pissings, Radio Friendly Unit Shifter, Serve the Servants and some other unreleased material) but the album is great anyway. A great way to get to know Nirvana's more commercial music. Be warned however: If you like Nirvana's less mainstream stuff (Frances Farmer Will have Her Revenge on Seattle, Floyd the Barber, etc.) this album is not for you. But if you just want their hits in one economical package, then by all means go out and buy this album right now.
B000002LSV|5.0|ZZ Top is the best rock n roll band ever. I have seen these guys live they totaly 100% + rocked. I dont have one bad thing to say about this band or this album. This album includes a great source of their hits like my favorite Tush but not all their hits. Still this is the best ZZ Top CD out their so buy it on amazon for the best price and enjoy!
B0000C1733|5.0|Forget about all the great songs that aren't on here. This compliation is just too good to pass up. It's obvious that the Pepper's put in a wider range of songs that would really represent their unique style. That's why less popular<BR>(and under rated) songs such as Road Trippin' are on here. Sure it would have been nice to have songs like All Around the World and Can't Stop on this album but hey... I'm happy with what I got. Honestly, the Peppers really have too many great songs to make a definitive collection of their work. But they came damn near close with this one. If you're just a casual fan of the Peppers I would recomend that you pick this album up as soon as possible. Hardcore Fans will want to pick this up for the new material (which is excellent) and the inclusion of the great &quot;Soul to Squeeze&quot;, which was previously only available on the Coneheads soundtrack. A great Collection for anyone!
0451191153|5.0|This is the story about one man, his struggles, and his triumph. It was truly an inspiring book in that it showed a man with integrity, courage, determination, nothing will stop me sort of attitude. Some have said that this man will go to any lengths to get what he wants  which is just not true, he is determined to find success and happiness on his own terms, by keeping his morals. This work is so relevant in today's timeframe with quotes like \\"its not what you know but who you know, truth is what my peers will let me get away with etc, etc.\\" This book rejects such beliefs. It was men like Howard Roark (the hero) that founded this nation and crafted the constitution with ideas such as man has a right to live for himself, that the world is knowable, and that happiness IS attainable; \\"right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness\\".<br />On a more personal note, I had just been kicked out of school when I read this, which was an extremely low point in my life. This book made me think that  I CAN accomplish, I CAN achieve happiness, life IS worth the struggle, and most importantly, I can do it on MY terms. Since then I have enrolled in a new school, am pursuing a degree, and have made dean's list as well as been invited to the Honors Society.<br />Note: If you liked this book I strongly suggest you read Atlas Shrugged, also by Ayn Rand. Or if you want a clearer explanation of the ideas in non-fiction form you may want to read The Virtue of Selfishness.
0684857820|2.0|All I could say when I was reading this book was: &quot;God help me,&quot; It was horrible. I had just come off of the cusp of The Lovely Bones (Which was breathtaking beautiful) and I greatly looked forward to reading her first novel. I was quickly sorry for that longing. How could an author stray so differently. This was just a yawn through of her rape to which to projected unrealist characters (her family and friends) while she gave off the aoura that nothing was wronge and then all of the sudden she would burst into tears and we- the reader- would have no idea why. The chapter with just the rape in it was captivating, but that's pretty much it, and toward the end theirs a courtroom chapter that drags on forever and is completly dry when it comes to feelings and emotions. I can only hope that when Alice Sebold's next book comes out that it swims into the same vain as The Lovely Bones and not this strange and dry work that was its predecessor.
B00006BTCA|1.0|Remember the record store in Pretty in Pink? Or how about the one in High Fidelty? I have a friend who runs one that's like a combination of those 2. Just the kind of place all us record /music fiends would like to spend our days and nights. <BR>He will NOT carry Interpol and will willingly and intelligently give his reasons to anyone who asks. He has even gone on to hold top 10 &quot;Why Interpol Sucks&quot; days with free CD giveaways to people with the funniest lists. I'd say that's a great way (and pretty darned funny too) to warn the buying public to not waste their money. <BR>Personally I find Interpol's music to be tolerable. They're decent musicians in a way. But it just doesn't do it for me. I mean I'm not saying the reason has to do with any of these immature arguments over comparisons. It just doesn't work for me. I feel that I'm very open minded and made a strong effort to listen to TOTBL 2 times all the way through all alone before I let myself pass any judgment as to what I'd heard. I just let myself hear the music. That's all. I just listened. Mind you this was before my friend started his Anti-Interpol campaign, so don't think that was any influence. I do very much so enjoy just about every one of the other bands mentioned in all these reviews and to do those reviewers justice, can kind of understand all their complaints. I don't say they represent my opinions but I can understand them. On the other hand I can't agree at all with all the &quot;Best Album of the Year&quot; comments. If you could prove you'd listened to the thousands of releases in 2002 and had any kind of musical sense, I could let you go but give me a break will you. Interpol, in their way, are ok, but I won't give them any more than those 2 listens. Glad I borrowed the CD and didn't pay for it myself. My friend would never let me live it down!
B0000025BL|5.0|WOW! What an album. Bat out of hell soars above evry other album and laughs at them in their faces, simply because it has the right to do so. This is a fantastic album which made Meatloaf a legend and created some of the most memorable and recognised songs ever. It was Bat out of hell, You took the words right out of my mouth, Paradise by the dasboard light and Two out of three ain't bad which made an unlikely superstar out of Meatloaf.<br />This album blew me away when I first heard it and altough a few of the songs may now sound a little dated, the magic from the first time I heard it is still their. Not one song on this album is a dissapointment which is why the album has lasted for over 27 years. This is the third best selling album ever and you must remember that people only buy good music. Bat out of hell was #36 in the US music charts in 1990, thirteen years after its release. It has sold over 35 million copies worldwide and continues to sell over 200,000 copies a year, today.<br />Meatloaf uses his huge lungs to proppel his voice higher than anyone elses and he manages to hit all the high notes in style. You can feel and hear his emotion when he sings because he creates characters for each of his songs and being an actor he plays the characters roles very well. This album is vital to anyones music collection and if you haven't got a copy yet, it is well worth getting. This album is the proof that Meatloaf is, larger than life.

B00000IAU3|4.0|The Russian mystic GI Gurdjieff says people are not born with souls, most people have insignificant souls, and those who do only have souls if they grow them! They grow them through patient work to overcome adversity, perhaps dealing with difficult people, and pain in life.<br />Dido strikes me as someone who has a soul. She seem to write from a place deep within her (as opposed to the superficiality of most pop singers her age). She writes as someone with more experience than her age. Within this place where she writes there seems to be much pain, sadness and melancholy. I don't believe this is a pose. But this area from which she writes communicates or resonates with many listeners. The writing seems like non-fiction, autobiography. It's all out there and it's all exposed.<br />The music here has an underlying wistful sadness, even the more (nearly) upbeat tunes.  From a musical perspective, this is good and bad - there is little contrast in tempo and emotional content between many of the songs herein. Dido sings with a soft voice and a somewhat limited pitch range.<br />Musically, a little more contrast would help. But what's there, if it resonates with you, communicates to the heart.
B0000959N0|1.0|Real artisits aren't in it for currency. Superhero and hobbit movies are made to fill the pg-13 CGI nitch and make money.

B0000AMRJC|5.0|When I first saw Scarface, I was just completely blown away by the acting thanks to Mr. Pachino as Tony Montana and how he became the top drug lord, and was taken down from power. <BR> Tony Montana is a poor Cuban who comes to the United States to escape from the Socialist rule of Fidel Castro, and once he gets to Miami, he says one of my favorites lines in the movie: &quot;Miami, it is like one big giant p***y ready to get f****d.' Now this is before the 80's; before the drug boom in Miami and throughout the urban US. Now Tony Montana starts to slang (dealing drugs) and now he is one of the highest drug lords in America; he lives in a mansion, nice cars, and everything you can think of. Now as Tony's empire gets bigger, the DEA does a sting on Tony, and they try to bust him, but no luck. Now he knows that there are people willing to kill him to get where he is, but he is lucky to get away with his life. <BR> Now he is in deep water, and a rival drug lord goes head to head with Tony Montana (the movie is called Scarface because he has a scar on his face, duh!) and now he is fighing for his life. This movie I recommend is NOT FOR KIDS! There are 182 f**ks in this movie, I counted, and this movie shows you that when you are a drug lord, you dont stay at the top forever.
0385504209|4.0|Yes, I really enjoyed this book. I read the Spanish version because it came easily into my hands (perhaps I'll read the original Language), and I finished it in only 4 days, from Tuesday evening to Friday night (note: I work 9 hours a day)... just couldn't leave it. The history don't have any weak or boring part... and the theme... is great!<br />I give 4 stars cause in the last 2 pages the final get obvious, but anyway, this book worth my sleepless nights.
B00008CLOA|5.0|This album will change the way you think of music. Touching, rousing, thought provoking and moving, the lyrical genius of Roger Waters is so strong here and the skill of the rest of the band shines through, especiallt David Gilmour's guitar on 'Time' and 'Money'. This album is best listened to all the way through and will take you yto places you never thought possible. My personal favourite album of all time, if you're young don't be put off, i'm only 18. Don't listen to the crap in the charts, listen to this
0192838679|5.0|An instant scandal when first published in 1782, 'Les Liaisons Dangereuses' remain as one of the most controversial books of all times. Not because it has detailed sexual descriptions --although it has a lot of sexual tension in its pages--, but because it has a candid portrait of the desire and showed the nobles in a way that they weren't used to seeing. Even the Queen, Marie Antoinette, had her copy and read the book with a different jacket, so that nobody wouldn't know she was reading Choderlos de Laclos' masterpiece.<br />The book is the collection of a more of 100 letters exchanged by a group of nobles in the end of the 18th Century. One of the things that make this novel so brilliant is that is supposed to be a work of nonfiction. The first thing we read is an Editor's disclaimer, where he tells his doubt on publishing these letters. Moreover, he states that the adventures told in those letters could not happen in their time. Then we read a preface written by the author where he tells that he didn't write the letters; therefore, it is not a work of fiction.<br />And 'Les Liaisons Dangereuses' is so well written that one can believe it is not a work of fiction. Laclos is able to switch his point of view in every new letter; but what is more remarkable is that every person has his/her style and the letters seem to be written by different persons.<br />In the story there are so many webs perfectly linked that it is almost impossible to put 'Liaisons' in a nutshell. It is easier to state what it is about, albeit different people can have different conclusions on a given work. This novel shows how empty and self-centered the nobles were; that they couldn't notice how much power and money the bourgeoisies had acquired. More than a sexual analyzes, this book is a sociological study of the emptiness of the French nobles.<br />This book has been adapted to the cinema a couple of times, and my favorite versions are the French one made in the 60s by Roger Vadin, that has a jazzy cool appeal; and the 1988 version directed by Stephen Frears, with a script written by Cristopher Hampton, based on his own stage play --needless to say, based on the novel.s a jazzy cool appeal; and the 1988 version directed by Stephen Frears, with a script written by Cristopher Hampton, based on his own stage play --needless to say, based on the novel.
B00005JLEU|4.0|Let me first say, that usually, I am not the biggest fan of anime, nor am I an expert, but I really enjoyed this film. It's about a young girl, who during a move with her parents, happens across a strange land, which is the home of the spirits. More importantly, it's about how this young girl &quot;grows up&quot; and matures in order to save herself and her parents.<br />  With that out of the way, this film was quite the head trip...strange things are thrown at you left and right...which is why I gave it 4 and not 5 stars...it was just a little TOO trippy, but that's okay...I liked it all the same. I enjoyed Princess Monanoke a little more, but I would reccomend this film to people anyway!
B000002KBA|4.0|Deep Purple In Rock is a timeless and classic hard rock album, its essential to any hard rock collection, well any rock collection in general! In Rock is hard, spaced, and greatly put together, it is a very concistant rock album!<br />Much like Led Zeppelin and Black Sabbath (the other big hard rock giants of the day) Deep Purple was on top of their game. Richie Blackmore is one of the best guitar players to ever pick up the instrument! the rest of the band are all very good at what they do weather it be Ian Gillans amazing vocal range, Jon Lords brilliant keyboards, Roger Glovers rumbling bass, or Ian Paice over the top drumming this band was at the top of their game when the recorded In Rock.<br />All The songs are classic, where as there isnt a whole bunch of songs its ok because the 7 songs that are here all are amazing. 'Speed King' is a great hard rocker. 'Child In Time' is one of Deep Purples best songs and the solo is the single greateest guitar solo ever played! just listen for yourself and you'll know what I mean. 'The Flight Of The Rat' is such and awsome song with a killer riff by Backmore.<br />Deep Purple In Rock is one of the best albums ever made, its just falls short of Machine Head because it doesnt have as many songs.
B0000214F2|1.0|Sadly, I cannot give this movie a low enough rating. I saw it in the theatre and paid full price and still regret it to this day. Robin Williams, rather than being funny, is more creepy than anything else, and I found the whole production rather  disturbing.<BR>     Unlike others, I was not so displeased with the whole \\"buck the establishment\\" preachiness of the film, but the fact that when Robin plays a serious/funny charater, it makes me feel dirty. The movie WAS preachy, and while I agree that bedside manner is of importance in the medical profession, I don't think I really want a doctor who floats around the hospital wearing a clown nose and playing with a bedpan. I'll pass thank you very much.<BR>    Furthermore, I dislike the fact that any \\"serious\\" doctor was protrayed as being unethical and uncaring. What a load of hooey. <BR>   I cannot give this movie a low enough rating, sadly. Avoid it like the plague!<br />     A final note, what is the deal with Robin Williams these days? The last movie I saw him in that I actually thought he did a good job in was death to smoochy. Why does Robin Williams only choose roles where he can be preachy and self-righteous? It creeps me out. YUCK!
B0000VAFO0|1.0|I had the poor judgment to watch Underworld last night. I'd say that it sucked big bags of furry rocks, but it wasn't nearly that good.<br />The Vampires and the \\"Lycans\\" (\\"werewolves\\" for the rest of us) have been at war for a thousand years, or maybe six hundred, or maybe some other figure--it seems to vary as the movie goes on. Selene (played, without significanrt ocular discomfort, by Kate Beckinsale) is a \\"Death Dealer\\", a vampire who specializes in killing werewolves, a commoditiy of which the vampires believe--erroneously--that they may be running out.<br />It's difficult to tell the vampires from the werewolves through most of this. They all look pretty goth-y, they fight for the most part with automatic weapons, so it ends up looking more like some sort of addled cross between The Matrix and The Howling, with a soupcon of Blade thrown in for good measure. Sadly, the end result is vastly inferior to any of these.<br />The plot, such as it is, appears to involve werewolves who are after this particular human who is a descendant of the first immortal (from whose bloodline both werewolves and vampires apparently sprang); Selene sorta falls in love with this guy, and ends up saving him, frist from the werewolves, then from the other vampires, because the interim chief vampire has set up some sort of back-door deal with the presumed-long-deceased leader of the werewolves. Now, the real chief vampire gets woken from hibernation or something by Selene, and he sets out to destroy all the werewolves (including the guy who Selene has fallen for, since he got bitten by the leader of the wereewolves and is now on the hairy verge, if you will, of becoming a \\"Lycan\\" himself), except that the real reason for this war is that the chief vampire killed his own daughter because she fell in love with the self-same not-quite-dead-yet head of the werewolves...<br />If you feel as though this gives you some idea of what a muddled mess this is, you don't know the half of it.<br />There was a lot of chatter when this movie came out about the scenario having been ripped off from some RP game or other, and--especially listening to the dialogue--it's awfully easy to believe that this is the case. The lines tend to be vacuous, but delivered with unfailingly portentous tone. Everybody here sounds like a 14-year-old dungeon master. Direction seems to be virtually nonexistent; according to the credits, a Len Wiseman deserves the blame here. This is Mr, Wiseman's first directorial outing, and it shows all over. His previous work was apparently as a prop assistant on Independence Day and Stargate. That shows, too. How he got this job is a mystery. Hopefully, he won't get another.<br />Bottom line: a dreadful piece of crap. You'd get more out of this movie if you ate the DVD with maple syrup on it instead of watching it.
B00006JDVV|1.0|When I saw this movie advertised, I was really excited, expecting to see fighter planes duke it out with dragons. Sadly, what I got was dirty american and english people complain a lot and get excited about the dragons, of which we get to see very few. The plot was thin and made little sense and we, the humans were victorious because we killed the one (and only!!) male dragon who, similar to fish (sort of), fly around overhead of the eggs to inseminate them. I am by no means a biologist (yet, I'm working on it), but it seems highly illogical to have one male for the entire species. I could see having the females outnumber the females, but to have only one in the whole world? I don't think so.<BR>     Additionally, we never got to see the joyus destruction of mankind and society. One day, everything is hunky dorey...then the dragon &quot;awoke&quot;, and then we fastwarward a number of years (couldn't tell you exactly how many...didn't really care that much) and *poof* society as we know it is no more. Do we get to see the carnage? NO! I would have rooted for the dragons, but we only got to seem a handfull of times.<BR>    Fortunaly, I was quite liquered up when I saw this movie, so that helped a bit...but not enough for me to ignore the fact that this movie was horrible. I couldn't even be comforted by the fact that there were two attractive actors in the film, due to the fact that they were dressed to be as filthy as possible.<BR>If I could have given this film a negitive rating, I would have. Don't watch it!
0684833395|4.0|Catch-22 can be a frustrating novel.  I HATE the first 50-100 pages.  The names of characters come flying out of nowhere.  The circular and contradictory style of writing just annoys me. The nonlinear style annoys me. <br />I stuck with it, and before you know it, it all comes together.  That is the key.  If you stick with it and not try to understand every single detail, or read every dialogue like you are some deep, intospective English teacher, it can be a lot of fun.  Understand some parts are supposed to be confusing, and it is normal to feel lost.  <br />One chapter describes the roundabout way Milo Minderbinder makes a profit.  It is supposed to sound absurd to you. Heller is sarcastically demonstrating the reality of war profiteering. Milo can make you furious, but what really made me furious was how he made no one else around him furious!<br />Overall this was just a fun book, that appeals to the average person looking for a good read, and the serious reader looking for enlightenment.  That is the genius of it.  For a couple of days while reading the book I was talking like the characters, and I drove people around me crazy. I do not recommend doing this, especially if you are married. Just have fun with it!
B000003N89|5.0|Diana Krall is the consensus Diva of Jazz these days.  While I don't necessarily agree, there's no denying her talent, and if you're curious about her artistry, this is a good place to start.  This, her tribute to Nat King Cole, along with the ensuing \\"Love Scenes\\", are her best works to date.  Highlights include the rollicking \\"Hit That Jive, Jack\\" and the haunting \\"Boulevard of Broken Dreams\\" (the latter proving that Krall is capable of doing something memorable that isn't necessarily \\"cool.\\")  Highly recommended, whether you're a big fan or not.
B0000AZJXQ|2.0|This is one of the most dissapointing albums i have ever bought, and it scares me to say this about Maynard James Keenan's band. I never cared much for Mer de Noms though it was decent, but this is a sheer disappointment. I do not enjoy the popularity of this album because that may draw attention to Tool and hurt their music as it did this. This album is WEAK &amp; POWERLESS. I swaer I had to turn my stereo to the highest level of volume to hear this. Good songs are: ,end of #1, #2, can't think of much else. And to RIAA, like to let you know I sold this Cd &amp; burnt it. Yeah, I made a copy of this &amp; it works. I would tell you how to do it but it is insignificant to this review. I recommend you BURN this CD and don't buy it, for you will be in total disgust of your waste of well earned money.
B000127LW2|5.0|...i'll start off by saying that i love this series and kate mulgrew as kathryn janeway...she indeed is my favorite captain (although shatner and stewart are no slouches either)...and the dvd set (plus bonus features) look great...however, all the wonderful character developemnet that seemed to be finally coming together around the second and third season, fell apart when 7 of 9 showed up...not that jeri ryan was bad, but when 7 out of 9 shows are about the borg, and/or the blond borg herself, let's face it...the borg were always boring to start with, and then it seemed like the whole crew was just obsessed about her storyline...still, with an excellent 'resume' behind them, the franchise didn't lose a step with voyager, and allowed every character to remain true to themselves, even if they had very little time to show it...but that's why trek continues, and will continue, it seems, forever...
B00014X8KO|5.0|I first saw a trailer for \\"Memories\\" in 1996 while watching \\"Sabrina\\" at a theater in Nagasaki.  I thought the bits of animation shown, along with the music were amazing and I was back in a theater when it came out.  I've seen it several times since and I still regard it as one of the better anime films out there.  Top rate animation, a fantastic score - I highly recommend trying to find the Victor Japan 1 1/2 disc original soundtrack (comprised of one full sized CD and a CD single sized disc 2, in some really cool packaging) - and great stories.  The animation style of the three, like the different stories, are all different.  Magnetic Rose is my favorite, and some of the imagery, paired with the haunting music (combining electronic music with Puccini arias and choral works), have had a lasting effect.  Stink Bomb, touching on biological/chemical warefare as well as the military, is pretty damned funny, and even more relevant in today's current global climate.  The final installment, Cannon Fodder, by Otomo-san, is the most original, both in terms of the animation style/character design and in the narrative.  There is a weird \\"child's story\\" feel mixed with a  Pink Floyd's \\"The Wall\\" vibe.  <br />I am just really excited that this is finally out on Region 1 DVD.  This is a work of anime that is definitely more accessible to mainstream audiences  (especially those who dislike the big, \\"saucer-eyed\\" style of anime).  I am glad that I resisted buying the much more expensive Region 2 set.  And did I mention how great the music is?<br />Utte kimasu!
B0000TB01Y|5.0|The songs to Schwartz's Wicked are excellent and well-worth the money; very upbeat (despite the dark lyrics), they are very different in comparison to many Broadway soundtracks.  Performances are outstanding and in particular by Kristin Chenoweth and Idina Menzel, both of whom excel and deserve Best Actress nominations for their roles.  Defying Gravity is certainly the highlight of the album, and other tracks, such as What is this Feeling?, Dancing Through Life, and Popular are just as commendable.
B000001ES9|2.0|This may be the worst Rush album there is, yet its no worse than some of the other 70's rock albums by the likes of Black Sabbath, Kiss, and Aerosmith.  The lyrics are lame, but Lifeson plays some good bluesy leads throughout.  The solos to \\"Take a Friend\\" and \\"Working Man\\" are excellent.
B0000DYJM6|5.0|Lost Dogs is a collection of moments of my love of this band.  Each song is one that one hopes to hear live at least once when they go to see PJ live.  From Yellow Ledbetter that closes many a show to my new live favorite rarity, Down, listening to Lost Dogs is a treat, songs that span the decade plus of PJ, you can hear how much they've grown as you listen.<br />I was really impressed with the song choices.  There are so many songs that could be used, yes, I do have a few favorites that I would have liked to have seen included but then again, I now have a few new favorites like &quot;Don't Gimme No Lip.&quot;  Lost Dogs simply reaffirms that PJ is an amazing amalgam of people and talents.<br />As usual, the packaging is great.  I really appreciated the little blurbs about each song and where they came from.  Lost Dogs is a great addition to your CD library.
B0000DD7NL|5.0|Well I got &quot;songs in a minor&quot; box-edition christmas 2002 and unfortunately enough I never paid the attention and TIME it deserved so I never felt the vibe and it ended up in my collection collecting dust! Well last december I start hearing &quot;u dont know my name&quot; on MTV and I was so sad coz I did the same mistake and just said &quot;oh my god another one&quot; and I never listened to it again! Now what happened is... my friend got &quot;the diary...&quot; and send me a msg telling me that is UNIQUE and SOOOOOOOOOOO NICE! It triggered my attention (really did) and so I prepared my self to buy it! I started listening again SIAM and guess what? I started to like it!!! After few days (yesterday) I went and got A.keys` new album  (w/bonus dvd) and I was really scared coz I didn't want to waste money especially when I could choose from &quot;TLC-GH&quot; and &quot;PINK-TRY THIS&quot; but I just bought it and went home... popped it in my hi-fi... and OH MY GOD! OH MY GOD! Well I really really can't find a word right now to express and let u understand what I felt when I listened to the album for the first time! It's amazinggggg!!!! It's better and more solid then her first! It does (fortunately) not need much time to get use to! There's no single track I dont like or I listen just because to force my self to like it! Sooooo go and buy it! It's a guarantee that u're going to like it! I'm not in position to review track by track coz I still have to get use to them but I do that soooon :-)! PS: u should too print lyrics and follow with them (the CD don't have the lyrics)! Give her a chance to grow in you and u'll never get her out! She'll surely touch ur heart with her wonderful piano playing and amazing vocals!! Amazing 10+ second effort! Go Alicia...officialy u have another FAN!!!! ps: my fave track now is: U don't know my name lol ;)<br />BTW: get the version (limited tough) with DVD coz it's so nice! It features 35mins of her diary! :)
B0000DD7LB|5.0|i found this album amzing! she truly has bared her soul, the songs a catchy and so what if they don't conform to teeny pop ways, she's a grown woman! she's discovering life, love, sex, responsibilities and much much more. I can truly feel how sad she is over her break-up with ex-lover justin timberlake, they have to get back together it was meant to be. I love all the songs but \\"everytime\\" is amazing as it captures just what a break-up feels like. her voice has matured and she has discovered how to put it to use, i just can't stop listening! I'm more of a fan now than i ever was, congratulations Britney!
B0000035E7|3.0|&quot;Nevermind was better, but not much better&quot; I remember reading somewhere, I think that guy was spot on. Very raw, Grunge/Punk. This is late 80's when Nirvana were still a garage band. (You can just tell) Yeah, this album did cost about $600 to make. Love Buzz, School, and Floyd the Barber, are great. Although some songs near the end arent. Only get this if your a die hard Nirvana fan, and want to hea something other than Smells Like Teen Spirit.
B0000AQVCL|5.0|first of all, &quot;Are You Gonna Be My Girl&quot; is my absolute favorite song in the whole wide world and if you dont think so then maybe you should stop taking crazy pills. i just heard this song on the radio and was dancing around in front of complete strangers. normally im not very social so this is a big breakthrough. but back to the point, I LOVE &quot;ARE YOU GONNA BE MY GIRL&quot; cause its the bestest song in the whole wide world!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B000002KHH|5.0|Sabbath's best album. From start to finish this album amazes me. Ozzy Osbournes voice is at its peak, Geezers bass lines have never been this good, Iommi's solos make this CD so good, and Ward's drumming in War Pigs, and many others sound spectacular. The title track, Paranoid, has been voted the best Metal song of all time, in more than 1 books, magazines and polls. I agree. You must have heard Iron Man by now, it has maybe the most catchy riff ever used in a Heavy Metal album. Faries Wear Boots has the best solo on the album, and best solo on any Sabbath album.  and Planet Caravan is so good Pantera made a cover of it, and made a single, and didnt change a thing really. Do yourself a favour, if you don't already have this Heavy Metal classic, pick it up.
B00005JM0B|4.0|...  If you were a fan of 1 and 2 you will be taken aback by this one.  It changes some core themes in the series.  The most major change, as I see it, is the concept that there is no future but what you make gets pre-empted for fate actually existing beyond your control.  In T3 there is an unavoidable fate for humanity - it was delayed by actions in the 2nd movie but it is inevitable.  The movie departs from Cameron's humanist viewpoint, a philosophy advocating the self- fulfillment of man within the framework of his principles.  Instead we are shown we do have a fate (there is a discussion of this sort of think in the movie \\"Minority Report\\" as well.)  This can be taken a number of ways.  When Connor sends Recce back to 1984 with the immortal line \\"There is no fate, but what you make,\\" was he lying?  Did he simply know that was what was needed to get his mother to act?  It's hard to say and perhaps can be further resolved in a 4th installment in the series.  Fate is like physics perhaps, if you throw a ball it is going to follow a balistic path - that is fate.  If the ball could do something, it might be able to alter part of that fate, say landing in the glove of the Cubs' third baseman instead of the lap of a hapless fan.<br />The movie wasn't what I expected.  As a fan I had high expectations and when they weren't met my first reaction was displeasure.  However after several months I've changed my tune.  I actually like this third movie now.  It challenged my thinking on the series that is a good thing.  I wonder if I would have been satisfied if they just did what seemed obvious?  (To each fan, what is obvious is clearly different!  In my case dealing with the smashing of Skynet and the fight over inserting heroes and villians into the time-stream.)  I think challenging assumptions and changing the direction of the series is actually more interesting than the alternative.<br />Plus, the third movie gives great scenarios for Atari's game Terminator 3: War of the Machines.  The game is a bit buggy right now but I've been playing it online for days and love it - it really captures the feel of the future war scenes vividly and the two present-day scenarios work well too.  In fact playing that game has given me more appreciation for T3.<br />On the critisism about the T-101 being too human like - he's an infiltrator, he's supposed to be human like.  We learn in the 2nd movie that they can learn and that normally the learning mode is put into suspension (Read-Only) and the infiltrator is meant to do its job on a certain set of assumptions.  The idea is that if the infiltrator were to learn more about the horrors of war and the value of life they might stop fighting for skynet.  So, is it logical that you could have a self-doubting, cicar loving T-101 800 Series Infiltrator with organic covered metal endo-skeleton?  I think so.<br />I recommend you check out this movie.  Do not look for the movie you were hoping for; check it out for the movie it is.
B000002KET|4.0|Everyone knows the title song, and everyones opinion is the same, fantastic. A National Acrobat is probably my favourite on this album, although it gets pretty annoying after you repeat it 100 times. Fluff is an instrumental track from Iommi and Geezer. Its not good for the album. Killing Yourself to Live, and Looking For Today are good, but not great. Sabbath Bloody Sabbath doesnt hold the magic of Paranoid. Theres no classic, like Iron Man on this album. Who Are You is horrible, and Spiral Architect, although on the Best Of inst that good.
B0001AP12G|4.0|We all know that Kanye puts it down as a producer, and he does his thing on the mic too. It is always great to hear great quality HIP HOP, not rap. If you thought thru' the wire was hot, (and come on man spit that with his jaw wired), you'll love the rest. -- Kanye will show on this album the good, the bad, the ugly.<br />Yo Kanye, \\"Jesus Walked with me\\" too!
B0001AP12G|3.0|I liked this album a lot, as a producer I love hearing kanye's work and his sampling is always tight. I thought his choice of beats that he kept for himself was interesting compared to things he's done with other artists, I didnt think he kept some of his best beats, but they were all good and they fit his style and personality. As a rapper I think he gets outshined several times by his guest artists most notably, consequence, jay-z, and twista. But I also liked that he rapped about other things and not just guns and coke cause that stuff is getting really tired. He has a good flow, sometimes his lyrics get a little basic and silly but he keeps it fun and tight and thats most important, 3 stars for quality... 5 stars for potential and production.
B00000294R|5.0|biggie, nas, big l best new york rappers if you don't have this album or arent familiar with this cd or big l himself go listen to dance music because hip hop is not for you
6304806434|5.0|Can't really fault this film at all. The action is fantastic, the casting is perfect and the love is just plain cute! Nick Cage is one of my favourite actors. I think he has class and a great ability to show emotion. He brings characters to life in a realtistic way.  <br />John Malkovich is just damn cool. He plays the intelligant guy who makes everyone else feel just stupid! He is scary but in a laid back way. <br />John Cuscack is beautiful. The way in which he spends the entire film looking out for Cage is really cute. All the men in this film are hot and they are fantastic actors. Everyone needs to see this film!
B00005QZ7U|5.0|I had no desire to watch this movie as I do not enjoy musicals. I usually get embarrassed for the characters who break into song, but with this movie I was amazed. The acting of Nicole Kidman and Ewan McGregor (what a hottie!) was superb. I was amazed a what good voices they had. I was mesmerized from the very beginning. The songs are just beautiful.<br />Listening to Ewan McGregor's woefull voice tell the tale of his beloved Satine was heartbreaking. I was sucked into the vortex of Moulin Rouge. I cannot understand how anyone who watched this movie did not fall in love with it and the characters. Granted the main character is a courtesan, but who cares? She falls in love with the penniless writer and true love prevails, she understands what 'true love'is. From the very beginning we know that their love was doomed, but we still rooted for them, for love is 'like oxygen' and we wanted them to be happy.<br />All in all, this was an amazing movie. I would suggest that you watch it before believing the hype. Amazing movie, I loved it!!
B0000DJZA5|4.0|If the Beatles have their unqualified masterpieces, &quot;Rubber Soul&quot;, &quot;Revolver&quot;, and &quot;Abbey Road&quot;, its only right to allow them one interesting failure too.  The whole concept of spending the early weeks of 1969 being filmed rehearsing underdeveloped music seems, in retrospect, like a disaster waiting to happen: how much creative energy could *you* generate under constant surveillance?  And its clear that no one, save Paul, really has any interest in this thing: the film clips in the &quot;Anthology&quot; show John and George looking positively miserable.  Those two got their own back at Paul by bringing in Phil Spector to mix &quot;Let It Be&quot; and &quot;The Long and Winding Road&quot; into aural incoherence. <br />And now here's Paul McCartney taking back (or &quot;getting back&quot;) the project and putting out the &quot;..as Paul intended&quot; version.  To be fair, it holds together a hell of lot better than the 1970 Spector version and cutting &quot;Dig It&quot; and &quot;Maggie May&quot; and including &quot;Don't Let Me Down&quot; tightens up the set and dramatically improves its flow.  <br />The album is weird in a way: musically stripped-down, digitally gussied-up. But it feels incomplete too: we know that a lot of other music was recorded at these sessions including full-band versions of &quot;All Things Must Pass&quot; and &quot;Suzy Parker.&quot;  And while much of it was throw-away quality, why not produce a fuller album encompassing more of the music?  Sure, this &quot;Let It Be&quot; is a nice, tight, polished product but was that really the whole idea to begin with?<br />The whole &quot;Let It Be&quot; debacle has gone through so many metamorphoses -- original release, bootlegs, more bootlegs, Anthology cuts, this new version -- it seems improbable now that any version of it would be at all satisfactory.   This version is far more coherent than and superior to the original 1970 release but something's missing here too... gone is the ragged, warts-n-all effect that the Beatles were shooting for and instead we get some bizarre hybrid of &quot;Let It Be&quot; and &quot;Abbey Road.&quot; <br />Dear Sir Paul... If you are a reader of Amazon.com, permit me to make a suggestion. Why not release a longer CD set culling as many relatively complete tracks from the sessions as possible, taking the best versions of the multiple run-throughs, and release it as &quot;Get Back&quot;?  Fans deserve an official release of a more complete version of these sessions and it would help to finally put this controversial aspect of the Beatles' history to rest.
B00008PW3Q|4.0|This is a very good CD, but it takes time to appreciate it for what it is, instead of what I imagine it could be. It doesn't have the great songwriting and harmonies of Christine McVie, so the Fleetwood Mac &quot;sound&quot; isn't quite there. It is not quite a return to Fleetwood Mac's glory days. Stevie doesn't sing like she did on Tusk. Time has gone by. What it does have is many excellent songs by Nicks and Buckingham, great guitar playing by Lindsey, and the usual solid rhythm section of Fleetwood and J. McVie. It also appears that Nicks let Buckingham do his own thing with production, resulting in something closer to Buckingham's &quot;Out Of The Cradle&quot; than a regular Fleetwood Mac CD. Yes, it is a little overpacked and has a few songs that would have been left off if Christine McVie was still around. Still, this is a keeper, and I'm glad Nicks and Buckingham decided to reunite, whatever their reasons were. I hope they make a few more albums together.
B00006IUL2|4.0|Am I the only one to notice that the killing of the Princess and her father is shown twice in the DVD version? (Is it in the tape edition also?) We see them burst into flame, then we go back to Medea planning the murder, and then we see it again! I wrote to the distributor and he said he forwarded my comments to the producers. I never heard a word from the latter. So I am posting this to ask if any one else has noticed this strange duplication. I would very much appreciate hearing from any body whose copy has the same flaw or does not.

B00005JM0B|1.0|Neither Furlong, (who was never offered the part) or Hamilton, (who found the script to be souless), were in this film. <br />It should not have been named Terminator 3... as it does not further the story line of the first two wonderful films.<br />This film was made to line the pockets of those who know the public will go out and watch just about any piece of crap on screen.
B00004BZ0N|5.0|Calling the Clash a punk band is like saying Picasso was just a guy who painted with blue a lot. This is the kind of album you can curl up to and listen to all the way through. It takes you into another world. I know how stoner-hippy-Pink-Floyd fan that sounds (and heaven knows I'm not one of THEM), but very few albums can do that for me. The Clash do it.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Maybe the title sounds exaggerarated but Id disagree I cant believe fox canceled this. These are without a doubt the most consistently good episodes of tv Ive seen I have admit that I was a little hesitant on the concept at first but once I sat down and watched them on dvd I realised how great this show was. Everyone that Ive shown it to agrees. So if you havent yet bought this buy it now you wont be disapointed.
B00006BTCA|1.0|Interpol has snuck in under the radar with TOTBL and in many ways deserve some of the praise they get. I tell you it's better that they emulate the Post-Punk late 70's and 80's than be just another of the mindless rock/rap or mall/punk combo's out there. <BR>In my opinion they've done a fantastic job of taking the sounds of Joy Division, Echo and the Bunneymen, The Smiths, Psychedelic Furs, Kitchens of Distinction, The Cure, and mixing it up with My Garbage Can, The Slime in My Septic Tank, Doggy-Doo on my Shoe, Ancient Leftovers in the Fridge, A Ball of Twine, and Roadkill. They've come up with something unusually complementary yet horribly bad. The derivative, contrite, boring, repetitive, unimaginative and utterly thoughtless sounds they've discovered have been thrust into the ears of the listening public and no Q-Tip can get them out. The baseball cap crowd will soon chase the vultures away and successfully resuscitate the lifeless corpse of Interpol. They will be huge I say. HUGE. Remember when only a few people really liked Nine Inch Nails? Then all the Neanderthal Meatheads came along and ruined NIN for years. You see that's kind of what will probably happen to Interpol. But instead of a really great band getting overexposed it'll be these horrible wankers being praised to the roof by young boys who need to cover their empty skulls with baseball caps and drink mass quantities of beer to compensate for not having a single individual thought for themselves. <br />Interpol are one of the most boring, unimaginative bands to come along in the past week and because most young kids spend no time whatsoever looking into the past to better understand the present or future, we'll be bombarded by them by the radio stations and major labels till even their most passionate fans rue the day they'd ever heard of Interpol and they'll go the way of Hootie and the Blowfish. A once hugely popular band that have sunk so far into the pantheon of overplayed pop that no-one will admit to ever having liked them in the 1st place. That, my dear readers is what makes Interpol so bad. They'll never make it in the long run. Even if they had talent, these are the days of use and abuse by the labels and virtually no one has a chance of ending up standing on their own 2 feet after the storm has died and gone.
0385507755|2.0|I'm sorry.  But I ain't buying it.<br />I believe James Frey was a hopeless addict, I believe he went to a facility like the one he described, I believe he has now kicked his addictions through sheer will power, and I admire him for it.  But I don't believe one of word of the dialogue he wrote in this autobiography, the characters he describes, or the interactions he had.<br />The people come off as archetypal.  The interactions make believe.  That's not to say he's not a good writer, it's just that I didn't believe what I was reading to be a factual account of what really happened.<br />He is imaginative and should write more movies.
B00000JNOJ|5.0|I first heard this record at a place called &quot;The Commune&quot; a house I stayed in while travelling through Detroit a lot back in the late 1960s working for the Young Socialists. I learned, not with music but in the brain, some of these songs like &quot;My Home in the Delta&quot; and they are so classic that they became part of my brain and my understanding of the blues both as a listener and as a performer.  I only got the CD about 10 years ago.<br />  This is classic music. This is your basic strong Muddy Waters performance coming straight at you.  This record reminds you that no matter what instrument a blues artist plays, no matter what level of world class excellence a blues artist achieves on an instrument or as a band leader---and Muddy was all that and more--BLUES IS A SINGER'S MUSIC.  A BLUES SINGER MAKES THE MUSIC WORK BY THE REALITY THAT SHE OR HE PUTS INTO THEIR VOCAL INTO the feeliong of the song whether it is funny, sad, angry, ironic, or all of them together.  Blues is about reality, and this music is about reality.<br />  It's interesting that just as we folkies back around 65 realized through Bob Dylan and other folks that being folk music had nothing to do with whether you used an electric or acoustic guitar but what kind of music you were playing, Muddy came out with this record on which he used his acoustic but had supurb backing from the great buddy guy on electric, and Willie Dixon and adds piano and bass and more instruments on other cuts.  Are these tunes any more folk music than his superb electric sets from 1947 on?  Are these tunes if they are so folk, any less the product of a great conscious artist and arranger assisted by another one, the great Willie Dixon, a combination for the Chicago Blues analgous and just as productive as Strayhorn and Ellington in Jazz?<br />  As someone who more or less performs in the category of folk singer and blues player, I find these artificial barriers between folk and popular forms of blues and country music to be the silly ignorance of people with bad views of culture. So much of the value of real folk music that was coming out of existing traditions of African Americans and Southern whites, among others, has been missed by people propelled by these ignorances.<br />  Two non blues examples I can give are Woody Guthrie and Doc Watson.  All the time Guthrie lived in Oklahoma he was a piano player and a mandolin player, two of the standard backup instruments for Texas and Oklahoma ranch dance music.  However, when he arrived in Los Angeles got in touch with the &quot;people's music&quot; crowd, he was informed that a true folk performer played the guitar.  Guthrie learned to play the guitar in LA on his radio program.<br />  When Ralph Rinzler met Clarence Ashley at the Galax Fiddlers convention and told him he wanted to record him and would be down to North Carolina to record him, Clarence showed up at the studio with Doc Watson with his favorite guitar, his Les Paul Custom, the instrument he learned to do all his lead guitar fiddle tunes (most of which Watson recorded first on the mandolin before he dutifully recorded them on Acoustic guitar).<br />  Everything Muddy ever recorded is real folk blues!y music to be the silly ignorance of people with bad views of culture.

078322804X|3.0|I liked this movie a lot, very funny classic. The only thing that would keep me from watching it again would be the music. The music was very corny. I just don't agree with two people having a conversation then all of sudden start dancing & singing at eachother. If you like music & comedy, buy this film. If you just want to see a funny comedy, rent this movie & keep the fast forward button handy.
0688163173|5.0|Dennis Lehane does it again, first with Mystic River, now with Shutter Island. He captivates the reader, pulls you in deeper and deeper, and then shocks you at the end. Dennis Lehane is without a doubt the top fiction writer in the game. Not only can he write books that capture your imagination but he can weave a story that you'll remember weeks after reading the book. Shutter Island is no different. The tale starts out with US Marshals Teddy and Chuck exploring the island looking for this insane women but soon nothing is as it appears, Chuck disappears, and Teddy starts to wonder if he'll ever escape the island. By the time you finish this book, you'll be questioning your own reality...
0671027387|4.0|I really enjoyed this book.  It was like a James Bond novel - even when some things seemed implausible, I was having a heck of a good time. Last night I finished the last 150 pages until my eyes blurred. I knew if I didn't finish before going to sleep, I'd be up all night!<br />I haven't seen too many reviews mention the character of Gabrielle Ashe, Senator Sexton's assistant.  She ended up being my favorite character for showing great courage at the end.
0385507755|1.0|A note to anyone contemplating this read- don't bother!!<BR>Frey is unsympathetic, unlikable.  Having traveled a similar road as the author, I fear the uninitiated reader will be left with the impression that Frey's mentality is indicative of ex-abusers in general.   I do share Frey's weariness of coerced spirituality.  Nevertheless, the reader should be aware that alcoholics and addicts come in all shapes, sizes and worldwiews.  In this addicts humble estimation, most of us have outgrown the phony, adolescent bravado which he so boorishly demonstrates throughout the work. This guy sucks !!
B000002KKK|5.0|This album(CD) from ZZ Top is awesome!!! Contains the classic tracks:Cheap Sunglasses,I Thank You,Manic Mechanic,and I'm Bad,I'm Nationwide!!! The other songs on the album(CD)are great also!!! A classic album!!! Two thumbs up!!! Five stars!!! A+
B0000DD7LB|3.0|Britney Spears is the type of artist who only has to put her name on something and it will sell. She is a great star. I'm not saying she is the best artist in the world, but her albums satisfy a need in most of us to have a small piece of Britney. <br />For me, I have had a kind of fascination with this lost little girl, and I want to see where she will go next. At this point, I really don't think she has found herself spiritually yet and that is perhaps why she writes only a little of her music. On the other hand, I think her audience (because we know so little about her, who she is on the inside, etc.) is curious just as to who Britney is.  I think we all want to find out.<br />We have been given little clues to who Britney is over the years.  I still wish she would record the song \\"Sometimes\\" with an orchestra - one of the most beautiful ballads she has ever sang. <br />If Britney is ever to record a solely ballads album like Madonna's Something to Remember, I think ballads like Everytime and Sometimes are true classics that should be remembered. I think they give a kind of glimpse into the heart of Britney. A human, who makes mistakes in relationships, but still loves innocently and unconditionally. I think she is a very remarkable person. This album will give you but a tiny glimpse into Britney's heart (even though In The Zone is so much about sex), but even a tiny glimpse into a heart this big makes buying this album worth every penny.
B000002KJQ|5.0|This is one of ZZ Top's best albums!!! Contains the classic songs:La Grange,Waiting For The Bus,Jesus Just Left Chicago,Beer Drinkers and Hell Raisers,and Have You Heard? A classic album(CD these days)!!! Five stars!!! A+
B00009XITP|5.0|This movie is my favorite of all time! The actors are great in this movie, and the story is so wonderful!!! Amanda Bynes plays a 17-year-old girl who lives in a five story walk-up in Chinatown, New York. She has never met her dad, but every year her mom tells her the story of how they met. Her dad, Lord Dashwood, was a major political force in England. Libby, her mom, had been seperated from him because people in Lord Dashwood's political advisory had lied to both of them. She decides to take off on her own and go to London to find her dad. Watch the movie to see what happens!!<br />The DVD is great, you should definitely get the DVD over the video to enjoy this movie more. It has a challenging &quot;What's A Girl to Wear&quot; game, along with commentaries, trailer, and hidden easter eggs.<br />This is a movie you will want to watch again and again! I love it!

B0000AMRJD|5.0|This is without a doubt one of the most classic mob movies of all time. Not your ordinary mob story, Scarface is about a Cuban man who becomes one of the most rich and powerful people in Miami. Al Pacino is in it, so come on, it has to be a great movie. I would not recommend this movie if you have a weak stomach or do not like gratuitous violence. If you are not one of those people, than this is an awesome movie to watch!
B0000DD7LB|2.0|I've always been a Britney fan, but this CD, especially coming after Christina Aguilera's Stripped CD, falls flat. Her voice is treated with special effects, even more so than her previous albums. And, usually you can get past her average voice to enjoy the poppy songs as a guilty pleasure. But, the only song that is good on this album is the single &quot;In the Zone.&quot; The rest is mediocre at best. I would download &quot;In the Zone&quot; from iTunes, listen to see if there is another song on the album you would like to add to your collection, and save the $$ to buy something else more worthwile on Amazon.
0440234743|5.0|John Grisham is one of today's best-selling authors. He has written over 2o books &amp; has gained kudos for his outstanding works. John Grisham is an ex-lawyer &amp; normally his books take its readers through courtroom dramas or other legal excitement but in one of his latest books, The Testament all such legal proceedings take a \\"back seat\\" behind an interesting &amp; fascinating adventure which the main character of the book makes to the core of Brazil. The author tosses the reader back &amp; forth between the courtrooms of Virginia &amp; the jungles of Brazil &amp; this change of scene makes reading this novel even more exciting. For me the plot of the book was highly intriguing &amp; I couldn't keep from staying up till 2 o'clock a .m. to finish it.<BR>The story begins in a plush Virginian office where the 10th richest man in America, Troy Phelan is furiously rewriting his last will. Phelan's three ex-wives, his six children &amp; a legion of lawyers, several psychiatrists, who they hired to examine him &amp; declare that he is of sound mind, wait breathlessly for his last decision. The whole procedure is taped &amp; after that he gets out of his wheelchair &amp; jumps from the 14th storey of his company Head quarters. The possible heirs to his fortune don't even feel like showing grief-they are glad they can at last put their hands on the money.<BR>Josh Stafford, the Phelan's lawyer, is the appointed executor of his holographic will &amp; he is in a kind of dilemma as Troy Phelan leaves his fortune of eleven billion dollars to an illegitimate daughter Rachel Lane. Now Josh is to find who Rachel Lane is &amp; fight against Phelan's children who want their piece of the cake &amp; hire a bunch of lawyers to contest the will. The only clue to where Rachel can be is a note saying she is a missionary living deep in the jungles of Brazil. So Josh finds an old friend of his to find her.<BR> Nate O'Riley is a litigator who worked for Troy's company for some time but then began drinking hard &amp; became an alcoholic. He got divorced twice &amp; surely his children weren't happy about that. He seldom meets them &amp; they aren't really eager to &amp; besides he spends a lot of time in rehabs. Now he is currently in a new rehab trying to beat once more his drinking problem. But he knows that there always is a crash after the treatment. He accepts Josh's offer to go to Brazil to get away from his troubles. And he crashes through Brazilian jungles, enters the world where money means nothing, where death is just one misstep away , to find a woman who holds a stunning surprise of her own &amp; is herself pursued by enemies &amp; who after all doesn't want to be found.<BR>Nate overcomes a lot of difficulties &amp; hardships &amp; twice or thrice gets a near escape from death during the storms &amp; from dengue fever. His encounter with this woman changes his life &amp; makes him believe in high powers &amp; in God. Seeing Rachel helping the Indians fight for life, Nate starts to revaluate his life values &amp; realizes that he can lead a normal life now without crashes &amp; hangover afterwards. Will Rachel take the money? Do the greedy heirs get their share? - you keep guessing throughout the book. And while Nate is trying to settle this legal matter with Rachel , the heirs start a vicious legal battle &amp; we see that  they are a group of vultures fighting for their \\"catch\\".<BR>To be honest I believe this is a highly entertaining read .Moreover the book is almost flawless. It's one of the best books I've ever read . Grisham writes with the inside knowledge &amp; the descriptions of Brazil (Pantanal) where he has been twice &amp; the legal gambit which is so familiar to the author seem to be  extremely realistic &amp; up-to-date. The Testament has adventure, love, romance, friendship, readily readable plot, everything that makes a book absorbing, thought-provoking &amp; truly moving. The author knows how to \\"slip\\" suspense  in his novel smartly &amp; explores the questions of being &amp; faith in it. I personally  believe it's the best novel in years, &amp; the pages almost turn themselves. The book is beautifully written &amp; has timeless descriptions of Brazil which are so vivid that you feel you've almost visited Brazil after reading this book. I'd certainly recommend this book to anyone looking for adventure &amp; suspense along with serious considerations of life.
B0000DD7LB|2.0|If you are looking for an album with some whispering lyrics and lots of background noise - this one is for you.  There is not an element of vocal talent on this entire album.  Synthesizers and oh, ah and uh is all you will really hear.  I certainly don't recommend this and really it just proves to me that image is often everything in the music biz.
B0000DD7LB|4.0|When Britney first came on the music scene she seemed like your sensation who'd create an album with a few fantastic singles on it, a lot of filler and then disappear off the face of the earth.  Now on her fourth album Britney's laughing her critics in the face, because each album moved from strength to strength and she really came into her own on her third self-titled CD.  In The Zone takes the move towards more adult-orientated music that started with Slave 4U and Boys and transplants it to the whole of the CD.  Max Martin is gone, and so are much of the hook-laden bubblegum pop that made Britney famous.<br />The album starts off with the Madonna duet, Me Against The Music, an over-hyped slightly mediocre effort that seemed more of a publicity stunt than anything else, and doesn't really give a good impression of the album as a whole.  As demonstrated on bonus tracks Before The Goodbye and Run Away (both collaborations with BT), Britney can do a dancebeat well, and suits it too.  The tracks Breathe On Me and Showdown are the best examples of this, although it's to Britney's credit that she doesn't just go down one avenue.  Just as her last album displayed her ability to move into different musical genres that you'd never have thought possible in her early days, In The Zone takes her even further.  Toxic uses violins, dance beats and a pop sensibility to create a single that stands out as one of Britney's best (and probably the pinnacle of the album); Touch Of My Hand has an almost Bollywood feel to it, but not to any extent that makes the song seem incongrous on what is essentially a pop album; Moby works wonders on the slow burner Early Morning, and Brave New Girl has a mildly electronic vibe whilst remaining Britney's most 'pop' song on the album.  Of course, just as there were the bland ballads beforehand (That's Where You Take Me and When I Found You spring to mind), there are the obligatory slow songs here, Shadow and Everytime.  However, whilst her earlier ballads were mostly boring filler tracks, the ballads here are a lot more interesting.  Even though the lyrics of Shadow are clichéd at best, it's catchy enough to make you listen to it rather than just skip along.  Everytime uses what sounds like a glockenspiel to evoke a kind of simplistic instrumentation and production hitherto unheard of in a Britney song.  The obligatory R&amp;B contribution by R. Kelley, Outrageous, is passable, but Britney's made such great songs by working with unexpected artists such as N.E.R.D, BT and Moby, that it's almost like Kelley was used purely for the name.<br />Those that compare Britney to Christina Aguilera, saying that Britney doesn't have her voice, are true, but her music is of a much higher standard and In The Zone outstrips Stripped in almost every sector.  Whilst Christina's raunchy new image didn't carry over into her music very well, leading to the train wreck that is Dirrty, Britney's change in image works in unison with her album and shows that she can do other musical genres other than pop, something that Christina cannot.  Significantly, whilst In The Zone might not have as many killer tracks as her last album, it's the first album where you can start to view Britney as an artist in her own right rather than another pop puppet.  This album proves she's got staying power.

B00005JMTN|3.0|I think we were all looking forward to BIG FISH, hoping it would be Tim Burton's comeback after the Godawful PLANET OF THE APES.  The good news is, it's WAY better than that hunk-a-junk.  The bad news is, BIG FISH ain't exactly Best Picture material.  I guess this isn't such horrible news, but I was expecting a whole lot more out of it, that's for sure.<br />BIG FISH is essentially two movies: one telling the story of Edward Bloom's life, and the other telling of his son coming to terms with his father as Edward's dying.  This part of the movie I felt failed slightly; I could just never get all that emotionally involved with any of the characters.  It spent too much time on this part, as well.  Or maybe they should've made the movie a good 15-20 minutes longer, and thrown in a little more character development.  A lot more, actually; especially for Jessica Lange/Alison Lohman's character.  I felt no emotion whatsoever when she and Edward Bloom finally got together.  Edward's life story feels very episodic.  I know, I know, they're flashbacks after all.  But none of it felt fluid, and I felt myself longing for more of it.  Perhaps the thing that most surprised me was that it was lacking explanation.  I feel very strange saying this, given that it's a Tim Burton movie, and some of the biggest joys in his movies are those which are never explained.  But nevertheless, the random fantasy didn't mix very well with the other, realistic half of the story.<br />OK, now on to the good.  Ewan McGregor is superb as the young Edward Bloom, as is Albert Finney as the aged Edward.  The rest of the cast does very well, too.  As always in a Tim Burton movie, the production design is fantastic, and Danny Elfman's music was pretty good.  But now for the best part of the movie, by far: the last five minutes or so.  Then, I got quite emotional.  It's these last minutes that make the rest of the movie worth watching.<br />Although not a great movie, I wouldn't go as far as calling BIG FISH a disappointment.  Just don't go in there expecting a Best Picture nominee, and you'll have a great time.
B00001U0DP|5.0|Roberto Benigni and the director of Life is Beautiful managed to make a comedy out of the tragedy of the Holocaust. He's a madcap clown of a character, finding joy in everyday life, insisting on making people laugh and see the bright side. Married (to a non-Jew, who also happens to be his real-life lover) and with a young son, he and the child are sent to a concentration camp in the waning days to the war. His wife voluntarily accompanies them but of course is separated at the sorting-out that occurs upon arrival at the camp. Benigni son stays with him, and he determines to make a game of the evils that surround them to keep the boy from becoming frightened and hopeless. On a whim, he turns the whole experience into a contest to win a tank, and each day tells his little boy (whom he hides at each inspection) how much closer they are to realizing their goal.<BR>The end is heartbreakingly predictable and yet proves the truth of the title: Life is Beautiful. This is NOT a movie to miss.

B0000019PA|5.0|This may be the best \\"rock\\" record ever made.  From my perspective, as someone who was a DJ for many years and who owns thousands of records and CDs, many from artists that the broad public will never know existed and that I have sought out for the last 25+ years, I can say that it is the best \\"rock\\" record that I have heard.  No, it isn't \\"produced\\" very well, but you really can't scream SO WHAT loudly enough to do justice to a comment that misses the mark that widely.  I struggle to think of a great rock album that I would consider particularly \\"well produced\\" (meaning \\"slickly produced\\") while I have a long list of great rock albums (early Iggy Pop, for example) whose production values would leave much to be desired among the lovers of the Bee Gees, Eagles, Backstreet Boys, Ricky Martin, etc.  Music is sound arranged in space and time.  To be \\"great\\" it must emotionally involve the listener.  If you will let it, this music will draw you in like music rarely does.  Yeah, there are times that notes are \\"missed,\\" but these are times that Jeff Mangum is singing so hard and loud, so wrapped up in the song, that it would sound wrong somehow if he magically hit the perfect note.  It would sound, let us say, overproduced, and the magic would be broken.  The bottom line is that the very first time I listened to this album, when I got to the end I realized that I was on my living room floor, crying like a baby.  Now, I'm a 40+ year old guy, Ph.D. educated, very analytical and not prone to fits of emotion.  So where did that come from?  From this remarkable record, of course, that was made on a small budget, by some people in Athens, Georgia, including a remarkable talent named Jeff Mangum who sings and plays his heart out, and who didn't need a big multinational congolomerate record company and corporate sponsors behind him to create this work of art.  Maybe there is hope for us all.
B000127LW2|5.0|Although I have been critical of Voyager in the past, I must confess that it was nothing short of impressive in its first three seasons. The show had so much promise, its huge story arcs and original concept made it a show to watch. The first season had the show proving itself quite nicely, with riveting science fiction and the intense drama of two disparate crews trying to work together. This show certainly had the makings of a champion, and although it certainly didn't fulfill all hopes, it had more than a few good moments.<br />Voyager's first season put exposition on hold to give us great stories. The approach paid off, as many were hooked on the show from the beginning. One of the show's greatest strengths was combining human drama and science fiction in such a way that the season never got formulaic, and we certainly saw that here. \\"Caretaker\\" was a magnificent pilot that nicely set up the show, introduced the crew's principal enemies and some of the tumultuous politics of the Delta Quadrant, and had quite a bit of excitement and suspense. From there, we saw episodes dealing with classic Star Trek motifs like time travel (Time and Again), unusual life forms (The Cloud), and justice (Ex Post Facto, one of the season's best shows). The show also tackled unfamiliar territory, such as genocide (Jetrel, another of the season's best shows) and treason (State of Flux, where Seska defects to the Kazon). All the while we got to know (albeit less than in the second season) the various officers of the ship: Janeway, the stern but optimistic captain (and, in the first year, far from the sanctimonious shrew she became); Paris, the navigator and funnyman (he provided the best comic relief) and his friend Kim, the homesick wet-behind-the-ears recent Academy graduate; Tuvok, the wry Vulcan; the Doctor, a crotchety hologram (and also very amusing); and Neelix and Kes, the pair of aliens along for the ride. The first season did a good job of introducing them, although it wasn'tuntil the second season that they really became more concrete.<br />The DVD is loaded with extras, probably to compensate for the fact that the set is exorbitantly priced. In any case, it's a must have for a collector or a fan.
B00005JKG9|1.0|The play become move became boring after 20 seconds. David Mamet's Pulitzer winning play was a waste of a movie. It gathered a star cast of people and did abosolutely nothing with them. A group of caniving men stuck in the office using darwins' theory of natural selection to the fullest was thoughtless. the plot was clear to early. And the countinous use of profanity is really the only reason that i could not shut my eyes. but most of all we must not forget the cliffhanger of an ending which made no since. if it wasn't for the fact that i hadd to do this as a class project i would have thrown this ... dvd outta the window

Yelling out BORING BORING BORING and then the classic Daleks inpersonation EXTERMINATE EXTERMINATE. That's how I feel every time I hear this band. <BR>No imagination whatsoever. <BR>If you're older than 25 you've already heard much better variations of this type of music so please don't bother with Interpol. They offer nothing original. If you're under 25 then this sound is probably new to you so you'll probably think it's cool to like this band. <BR>Life is wasted on youth.

B0000039PW|5.0|When this album came out, in 1994, it went platinum. With that he has been crowned the king of the east coast. For Biggie, it wasn't easy getting this far. His hit \\"Juicy\\" was one of the reasons for his big fame. But still, many rappers have dissed him. Such as, 2Pac. The king of the west coast. They started as friends, later, enemys.But about this album, came out as an old school hit, and sold as one of the best ones. Now about 2Pac, and biggie. Biggie being on Bad Boy Records, and 2pac being on Death Row, those two labels were enemys. And later, some one from Bad Boy Records shot 2Pac, and the same happend to Biggie. But some one from Death Row shot him. And what I am not liking is that, they are both dead. Biggie doesn't get the attention he needs. I mean, they are both dead, people! But Biggie doesn't get a movie! and people are just not caring for Biggie like they are for Pac. But what did happen cause of Biggie's death, the album \\"Life After Death\\" got released in 1997. A album in honer of him dying. When Biggie \\"released\\" that album, he got even more famous. even though he is now dead. But that album did get released in honer of Biggie's death, but Biggie still should get abit more than that like a movie. When this album came out, Bad Boy records was lucky for what they were getting, and that tells people that this is a must have album. Just like his 2nd album did. He was an awesome guy. Bad boy wasn't the perfect record label at first, but when this came out, it was one of the most best selling record labels. As the copies of this album sold and sold (which they are still selling) bad boy got more and more popular until it was platinum. and Biggie was awesome. he sold great, he died.... he didn't get what he deserved. I think we need to give Biggie some credit, and make mabey.. a movie about his death..? whcih 2pac got. well, this album, is awesome, and I think if all of you are a rap fan and you don't have this, you must get it as quick as you can. and thatis all I will say.

0446605409|5.0|&quot;Plum Island&quot; is probably my favorite detective novel of all time.  No surprise here: DeMille is my favorite author, and in Plum Island he does not let us down.  DeMille has two general modes for his writing: deadly serious (e.g. &quot;The Charm School&quot;; &quot;Word of Honor&quot;) and somewhat humorous (e.g. &quot;The General's Daughter&quot; &quot;The Gold Coast&quot;).  Plum Island falls into the latter catagory, which is not to say that it does not have its serious moments.  I am saying that it is absolutely hilarious at times, even if it is a murder mystery.<br />The plot is simple enough (no spoilers here).  Detective John Corey is recovering from a gunshot wound in a rustic part of Long Island.  Two of his friends are murdered, and the local law enforcement officer asks for Corey's help.  The two victims worked at a top-secret Federal germ warfare facility, so things quickly get very complicated.  More would be telling, but I guarantee that the ending is unpredictable and does not disappoint.<br />The story moves along at a brisk but not hurried pace, never drags, and hold the reader's interest absolutely.  John Corey is one of those unforgettable characters that only very talented authors (like DeMille) are capable of creating.  DeMille's marvelous sense of humor is never far away despite this being a murder mystery, and this lightens things up without trivializing it.  DeMille's prose is peerless, and it is hard to imagine anyone not enjoying this novel.<br />Plum Island deserves every one of the five stars I gave it.  Read it and I imagine that you will agree with me!
0375422307|5.0|I read an interview with the author in the New York Times and decided to look for this book when it was published. I wasn't disappointed. <br />Satrapi begins with a brief history of Iran from the last millenium up until 1969. Her life and historical events become very intertwined from that point on. As the book progresses, you get the feeling that the pictures she draws are the closest thing to what she remembers, and this book is as much for her as it is for the reader. <br />There are a lot of political issues covered in the book, but again it is done in the perspective of how it affected this girl's home life. Nor are the issues clear cut, and some American readers might find this perplexing. Satrapi and her family were opposed to the Shah, to American and British imperialism, as well as to the Islamic Revolution. War is portrayed as a noisy, fear-inducing monster without a face that can mislead boys towards dismal fates and reduce a neighbor into a strip of flesh wrapped up with a turquoise bracelet.<br />In the end what the reader is left with is a very creative woman's effort to record the memories of her childhood and share them with anyone who cares. I can't wait to read the sequel!
6304602944|4.0|I bought this dvd for christmas and watched it for the first time in a while.  Kurt Russell steals the show from his partner and if this movie starred anybody else, then it would have came out a lot worse than it did.  Russeell is Gabe Cash and Stallone is Ray Tango, the two toughest and hardest cops in the city.  They have done so much damage to the crime syndicate's income that Yves Perret(a brilliant Jack Palance)has to take matters into his own hand and get the duo off the streets.  They get set up and end up in a maximum security prison only to discover that if they don't escape, their is no hope for survival.  This movie really owes a debt of gratitude to Harold Faltermeyer, who uses all kinds of COOL beats in his score throughout the film and keeps the viewer interested.  This movie could have been longer, but I won't complain considering the action films that are being made these days are really stupid!
B00000J7RZ|3.0|1999 seemed to be one of the biggest years for \\"Pop\\" music. That year brought us some of the biggest names in music including Britney Spears, Christina Aguilera, Justin Timberlake (then with N SYNC) and of course, actress/dancer/singer Jennifer Lopez. Jennifer, in her 5 years in the spotlight, seems to be everywhere. She dances, she acts, she sings, she is constantly getting remarried. This being the case, there is, of course, a lot of rumours, etc. about Jennifer's work. Her June 1999 debut, On The 6, was a mixture of \\"Pop\\", dance and latin music with quite a few ballads. Jennifer has never had a strong voice but she does have a knack for bringing us purely entertaining music.    Like most albums from that time period, Jennifer Lopez's \\"On the 6\\" (named for her childhood subway line), begins with her hit single, \\"If You Had My Love.\\" This was a rather upbeat, danceable track in which Jennifer discusses what she wants in a relationship. (\\"If I give you me, this is how it's got to be, first of all I won't take you cheating on me\\"). The lyrics are fairly standard however Jennifer's voice doesn't sound too bad. Following this comes the beautiful ballad \\"Should've Never\\". It tells a sweet yet sad story of falling in love with a man while already dating someone. The lyrics are beautiful despite the fact that the message (keeping the relationship with the second man a secret) is not so good. Also, another downside to this song is its length. The song is over six minutes and frankly, only the first three or four minutes are necessary. The last three minutes consist of the background singers singing the chorus repeatedly as well as Jennifer whispering a few lines in Spanish here and there.    The third track on the album is the Spanish-tinged \\"Too Late\\". Despite Jennifer Lopez's limited vocal ability, she handles this song quite well even though it has a few lyrical missteps. (\\"Gave me time and diamond rings but something else was missing.\\"). Its not that the lyrics don't make sense, it is just that they do not fit quite right into the song. Also, the bridge of the song completely brings down the quality of the song both vocally and lyrically. Next, we come to three of the weakest tracks, \\"Feelin' So Good\\", \\"Let's Get Loud\\" and \\"Could This Be Love\\". \\"Feelin' So Good\\" was produced by P Diddy (then known as Puff Daddy) and Mario Winans but it suffers from an irritating rap verse, poor lyrics and a highly overused topic. As I've probably mentioned before, I generally dislike the \\"I'm feeling great\\" songs and the \\"I'm the same as I always was despite my fame\\" songs\\" and this one is no exception. \\"Let's Get Loud\\", which was written by Gloria Estefan, could have been great but it seems to be lacking something that I can't quite put my finger on. Jennifer's voice is not suited to this kind of song and the lyrics lead absolutely nowhere. \\"Could This Be Love\\" could have been a very beautiful, heartfelt ballad but Jennifer relies far too much on background singers, which takes away from the quality of the song.    Next we come to a Spanish duet with Marc Anthony, entitled \\"No Me Ames\\" which, as far as I know, means \\"you don't love me\\". I can't comment too much on this song since I don't even speak Spanish. For the average non-Spanish-speaking listener, it is nothing more then an average track though I'm sure if I understood the lyrics it would be better. Afterwards comes my personal favourite, \\"Waiting For Tonight\\". This song has probably the best lyrics on the album and Jennifer's vocals work extremely well with this seductive track (though it is not a slow song). \\"Open Off My Love\\", which comes next, has too many of the same problems found throughout the album. There is too much reliance on background singers, the lyrics are subpar and the bridge of the song is exceptionally weak. Fortunately, after this we have a sweet ballad, \\"Promise Me You'll Try\\" in which Jennifer tells her man basically not to make promises he can't keep (\\"Don't promiseme forever, don't promise me the sun and the sky\\") but just to promise her he'll try (although it is never established what she wants him to try). Jennifer's voice is slightly weak in this song but the lyrics make up for it.    The last four tracks do not stand out very much at all. \\"It's Not That Serious\\", written and produced by Rodney \\"Darkchild Jerkins, is sung in a somewhat choppy manner (you'll understand when you hear it) make it seem a lot longer then it really is. After is \\"Talk About Us\\" which could have been beautiful but seems too similar to \\"Promise Me You'll Try\\". \\"Talk About Us\\" tells the tale of wanting to know what comes next after what sounds like a one-night stand. By this point, little about this song stands out since the lyrics and even the music seem to have been done before. The final two tracks are a slower version of \\"No Me Ames\\" and a Spanish version of \\"Waiting For Tonight\\" which, seeing as this is Jennifer's debut, probably should have been replaced with something original or left off completely.    Overall Mark: 2.5/5    Jennifer Lopez's debut brought some decent tracks but in the long run, it is not a very memorable album. Despite some excellent writers/producers (including P Diddy, Gloria and Emilio Estefan and Mario Winans), Jennifer's debut album fails to bring anything truly memorable other then a couple of decent singles. There was far too much emphasis on the background singers, which just calls more attention to Jennifer's limited vocal abilities. Also, she had a hand in writing quite a few songs on the album though unfortunately, many songs had subpar lyrics. Overall, I would only recommend this if you are a diehard Jennifer Lopez fan.

0345308239|4.0|The basic point of \\"The March of Folly\\" is that nations can be as irrational and dysfunctional at a policy level as individuals are in managing their own affairs. To this end she cites the Trojans (in their war with Greece, and particularly in bringing the horse into their city against the dictates of caution and prophecy), the Renaissance popes, England's handling of her American colonies, and US involvement in Vietnam. The book was written in the context of the arms race with the Soviet Union just prior to Perestroika (I hope I spelled that correctly), with the hardly tacit implication that this was the Great Folly of that time.<br />Tuchman's definition of Folly is very precise. It's much more specific than simply \\"a really stupid thing to do\\". <br />\\"To qualify as folly for this inquiry, the policy adopted must meet three criteria: it must have been perceived as counter-productive in its own time, not merely by hindsight. ... Secondly a feasible alternative course of action must have been available. ... third ... the policy in question should be that of a group, not an individual leader.\\"<br />These are quite exacting criteria. The first means that there must have been a reasoned outcry against the policy at the time. The second that reasonable alternatives were put forward. And the last that the whims of individual fools are discounted.<br />It's easy to look at government policies in today's world of which one might disapprove (let us suppose that, as for several other reviewers, the war in Iraq springs to mind here) and, on the assumption that they will fail, mark them as follies, but it seems to me that in any reasonably free or democratic society, there will always be arguments that a policy is \\"counter-productive\\", and many \\"feasible alternatives\\" (such as doing nothing) tabled. As such, almost any failed policy of a modern democracy will qualify as folly by Tuchman's definition.<br />For democracies, it seems that to qualify as folly a policy should havenearly overwhelming public support (rather than merely being pursued by a group) at least at its inception. The war in Iraq is still a wildly popular one, and so it would qualify as folly even under this criterion. Of course, it still has to fail.

0893815187|5.0|It's perplexing to me that this book should garner any controversy.  I am not a proponent of \\"naturism\\" nor is anyone in my family.  I grew up with what I consider to be among the best, most loving, protective and capable parents ever. But if Sally Mann's work constitutes something immoral or illegal, then my parents and those of most of my friends should be arrested for the content of our family photo albums.  The photos in this book are nothing more or less than extraordinarily beautiful captures an ordinary childhood.  Any one of the photos could have been taken at my house growing up (with, of course, a gifted photographer) under normal circumstances.  My sister basically refused to wear clothes until she was 5. We actually lived in an apartment building then and she was known to run naked in the hallways if my parents opened the door a crack.  As a result, there are a hell of a lot of photos of my sister naked as a child.  There's nothing exploitative or innapropriate about any of them, nor do I get any sense of impropriety whatsoever with Mann's photos.  I suspect that any impropriety perceived has to do with the person looking at the photo - and by extension that individual's cultural sensibilities and personal experience - rather than the photos themselves, and likewise, unfortunately I think I can safely presume that they didn't cause a ripple of controversy anywhere outside of the US.  They are simply stunning works of photography.  The one of her daughter wearing the rollerskates on the porch is one of my favorites, perhaps because it reminds me most of my own childhood.  The rural Virginian setting is remarkable in its own right and  as a backdrop no doubt makes the photos even more evocative for those who, unlike myself, grew up in similar environs.

6304708491|5.0|...Has ALWAYS been one of my favorite Beatles movie! It's completely insane, full of good, improvisational-style comedy of the Monty Python type, (in fact, I can almost guarantee you that this film and \\"Hard Day's Night\\" inspired the Pythons directly, as well as the godforesaken Monkees!) and excellent tunes by JPG&R! Just about everybody from this film went on to very respectable acting careers in film and theatre, especially Leo McKern and Eleanor Bron. Roy Kinnear became Richard Lester's signature supernumerary. And I'm still amazed at Victor Spinetti's strong resemblance to Donald Nixon.<br /><br />A completely zany flick, this film follows the boys as they establish themselves in a new set of linked cottages in a spiffy clean, quaint working class part of, (presumably,) London, with the sight gags starting immediately as an enormous organ pops up out the floor of Paul's section of the cottages; John selects and kisses a copy of his own \\"Spaniard In The Works\\"; George instructs a bumpkin to mow his rug with snapping gag dentures and Ringo selects fruit and soda from his own row of vending machines!<br /><br />Enter the villains. In the opening teaser, it is established that a cult that is into human sacrifice has noted that Ringo has possession of a gaudy ring that they have lost that is crucial to their ritual sacrifice. They immediately go to London to re-obtain this ring so they can conduct business as usual and it is up to Eleanor Bron, as the very pretty Ahme, to get the ring from the hapless drummer.<br /><br />Craziness ensues as they chase the fabs from locale to locale to get the ring, first to the recording studio, then an Eastern restaurant in London, then the alps, then to London again and Scotland Yard and then to the Bahamas. About half the movie takes place in the Bahamas where we see the bulk of the music performed in the movie as well, and what we hear is among the Beatles best pre-psychedelic work...in fact, this is the beginning of the Beatles experimenting musically beyond the simple post doo-wop stuff they had BEEN doing up till that point. The very folk-rocky \\"You've Got To Hide Your Love Away\\" is performed after Ahme comes over to their side and it is perhaps the most moving pre-Rubber Soul/Revolver tune of theirs.<br /><br />The first time I viewed a copy of this movie on VHS, the spoken dialogue in the flick was kind of raspy, but the songs were crystal clear with excellent stereo separation and cleaning up. I have yet to hear an up-to-date copy, and it may be awhile before I do, since MPI has stopped issuing the danged thing! Come ON, people...EMI, Apple...SOMEBODY, get this puppy back on the market!<br /><br />Anyway....George and Paul are the ones who shine the most musically in the film and on the accompanying album, with John singing the incredible \\"Hide Your Love Away\\", the boring and overplayed \\"Ticket To Ride\\" amd \\"You're Gonna Lose That Girl\\". It seems that John, except for \\"Away\\" is still somewhat rooted in the earlier days yet with his tunes here, while Paul and George are exploring the fringes of country/folk rock with \\"I Need You\\", \\"Another Girl\\" and \\"The Night Before\\". The film/album is also the first appearance of the sitar in anything by the Beatles, showing up in incidental music in the film.<br /><br />The boys easily out-zany the Marx Brothers in this film, carrying themselves like a clever bunch of high school/college cutups with their own little in-jokes and routines for us to giggle at. Richard Lester became known for directing this sort of zany, farcical stuff, with only occasional forays into regular dramatic moviemaking. Unfortunately, since 1975, he has become very much the ordinary director, after creating masterpieces like \\"The Three and Four Musketeers\\", \\"Robin & Marian\\", \\"A Funny Thing Happened On The Way To The Forum\\" and others...<br /><br />This is the Beatles at their all-stops-pulled cleverest, musically, theatrically and otherwise. Their charisma was immediate, and I guarantee you, you will become a fan by the time this movie is over.<br /><br />TOTALLY nuts!this movie is over.    TOTALLY nuts!

B0000VCZK2|5.0|Best:<br />1) The &quot;Alien&quot; movies are well-known for their high production values, great acting, realistic sets, outstanding creature effects and eerie atmospheres.<BR>2) For all 4 films, there's an original theatrical version (the best for pacing) and an expanded DVD version (with deleted scenes restored). The original versions are still the best, but the expanded versions add more character information and answer questions that diehard fans have asked for years.<BR>3) People who weren't huge fans of &quot;Alien 3&quot; or &quot;Alien Resurrection&quot; have a new incentive (through restored scenes) to give each another look.<BR>4) In addition to newly-made commentary tracks for each film, there's enough special features to choke an elephant. With the many hours of extras, you get SO much behind-the-scenes information you might say &quot;enough already&quot;.<br />Worst:<br />1) The plastic spindle plates that hold the discs in place come loose easily, so you may have to get out the glue.<BR>2) I, like many, am still ticked that I already spent good money on the &quot;Alien Legacy&quot; set (that we THOUGHT was the definitive collection at one time) only to turn around and spend an equal amount to get this REAL definitive collection.<br />Recommendation:<br />This movie series is absolutely legendary and the special features for this collection are simply tremendous. It's a no-brainer - get this set NOW (whether &quot;Quadrilogy&quot; is really a word or not).
B00008EYA5|3.0|&quot;S.W.A.T&quot; is a surprisingly standard cop flick, a throwback to a calmer if not recent cinematic era. It is still stuffed full of guns, villains and mayhem, but unlike &quot;Bad Boys II,&quot; or even the excellent &quot;Training Day,&quot; the movie does not paint an urban world teetering on the brink - criminal masterminds run amok, but Los Angeles isn't quite burning. It seems bizarre to consider &quot;S.W.A.T&quot; comforting, but it is.<br />Colin Farrell is Jim, a former S.W.A.T member relegated to scrub duty after he and his rogue partner, Brian (Jeremy Renner), break protocol in a hostage negotiation.  Sam Jackson is, yes, Hondo, chief of a newly formed crew that resurrects Jim's career from the gun cage. LL Cool J and Michelle Rodriguez play Jim's buds, while Josh Charles, the do-good cop, is Jim's main shooting rival on the crew. Director Clark Johnson charts the crew's training - it amounts to a recruiting poster, set to a video game soundtrack - a circle changeup, of sorts, to the usual hit-the-ground-gunning structure of most modern cop films.<br />The crew eventually is dispatched to handle the prison transfer of a Eurotrash crime boss (Olivier Martinez) who brags, in the movie's most quotable line, that he will offer &quot;one hundred meellion dollars!&quot; to any brave crook willing to bust him free. Half the city's loose cannons are up for it, including Brian, now off the force, who has a connection inside Hondo's crew. In a twist, Martinez's character is not a supervillain of limitless cunning and strength, but an ineffectual, well-funded heel, pout-lipped and soft-bellied as Brian escorts him through sewers to the rendezvous: a private jet waiting on an LA bridge. <br />Renner was unknown to me, but his few scenes with Farrell crackle with energy. The face of an insolent cherub, he makes for an appropriately smug sellout. Jackson, for once, is the calming influence collecting a paycheck, and &quot;S.W.A.T&quot; is better off without hisbravado. And while Farrell has not yet proven his acting chops - we'll have to wait for Oliver Stone's &quot;Alexander&quot; - there is an offhand, understood masculinity that recalls a young Mickey Rourke, or Sean Penn. Only Rodriguez, notching another asexual sidekick role to her club, is a bust. <br />Cynics might call &quot;S.W.A.T&quot; inconsequential in that relives the climax from &quot;Die Hard 2&quot; and generally avoids the graceless, graphic violence of its 2003 competitor &quot;Bad Boys II.&quot; I far preferred it; unoriginal as the movie is, &quot;S.W.A.T&quot; is the very idea of escapist entertainment without the sideline helping of head wounds and nihilism. Action junkies should eat it up.
1559408855|3.0|I remember that the theatrical release of Pasolini's SALO was quite a test for our European democracies. For example, here in Switzerland, we had to go to France if we wanted to see it. Nearly 30 years later, SALO is available at your local drugstore. Times change.<br />There aren't any extras on the Criterion DVD in my possession, apart of a written essay delivered in the case. The colours are sad and, unfortunately, SALO being extremely verbose, the subtitles most of the time hide a great part of the action on the screen.<br />Now for the movie itself. Everybody has understood that SALO is an allegory about fascism using the disguise of an illustration of the Marquis de Sade novel. That's all. So why all the fuss about this movie ? Simply because it was the first time that a reknown director explicitly showed on screen sexual perversions implying scatology and torture. Now if this film has stopped in any way the rise of the fascism in the world, I let you find the answer by yourselves.
B000089RVX|4.0|This record is stunning. Amy Lee has a wonderful voice with stupendous vocal range, allowing her to pull off some unutterably good vocals. I am not a fan of guitars, but this record delivered a style that I enjoyed. Influenced by glam, goth, and some metal, it managed to deliver an intensity without being overwhelming, and simultaneously being intensely melodic. The music is frequently augmented with classical instrumentals, electronica, and dark chiors, to create a brilliant hybrid and enchant the listener.<br />Many people have criticized this record for being to linkin-park like, and although there is some similarity between Linkin Park and the second track, Bring Me To Life, the rest of the album is devoid of any comparisons. Evanescence is most comprable to Italian gothmetal group Lacuna Coil, although Evanescence has a more melodic sound, and more developed.<br />Overall, this record is very enjoyable, and whilst being intense, is not a headbasher whatsoever. The sound is dark, beautiful, dramatic and intensely entertaining.
B00005JMJ4|5.0|I don't get this movie. I guess it's supposed to be two people kind of sort of falling in love, but never really kissing or making a booty call. I don't think it's realistic. But maybe the people who like it have experienced relationships like that. Either way, I was bored. The visuals of Japan are great and as realistic as can be. It shows how strange modern day Japanse culture feels to the American. Overall, I found it barely watchable. I'd rather sit through XXX or Too fast, too furious. Never seen either one, but I'm sure at least something happens in them. This movie wanted to be subtle like \\"Tennenbaums\\" or \\"Rushmore.\\" All your artsy friends in the graphic design class will probably highly reccomend this movie, but I reccomend that you think twice.
B00004R776|5.0|The Big Lebowski is the greatest film ever made and a cult classic.  The cast is exceptional and the dialogue superb throughout.<br />Upon first watch it doesn't seem particularly special but it grows and grows on you once you get into the characters.  John Goodman was born to play his role as Walter the gulf war veteran and best friend of The Dude who is played by Jeff Bridges and based on a real life person called Jeff Dowd.  Jeff Bridges is fantastic as The Dude who is 'in the running for laziest worldwide'.<br />The film is typical of the Coen brothers' genius and their greatest masterpiece.  The plot twists and turns with a laugh a minute along the way.  The cinematics are exceptional and it boasts one of the greatest most fitting soundtracks I've ever heard.<br />If comedy is your bag baby, then this is a must see!
B00008PW2D|3.0|I had to buy the Fifth Season to keep up with my SNTC collection.  But one thing I'd forgotten about was how short the Fifth Season was.  So there I went to the store and plopped down my hard-earned money, and after opening the DVD (can't return it now!), I remembered too late that the show was half its usual length.  That's when I realized I'd been seriously ripped off--half the show for double the price?!  Too bad I own this now and too bad HBO didn't think to bring the price down to match.  Here's a tip for those who haven't bought the Fifth Season yet: if you or a friend have an annual membership to one of those bulk-purchase warehouse stores (in the US--they're everywhere), you can buy one of the other SNTC season DVDs (if you're missing one) and get money off of this one in-store.  It's not the BEST deal, but it's better than how I made out.  As for the entertainment value of this season itself...well, it surely wasn't one of the best but it was a good couple of hours (8 episodes only-unbelievable) of semi-entertainment in a semi-SNTC fashion.  Can't win 'em all, I guess.
0553573403|5.0|I do not give five stars lightly, particularly for fiction books.  Out of over a hundred fiction reviews, this is only the third book to ever receive five stars.<br />Why does this one merit five stars?  Intricate plotting, fully developed characters, an interesting back-stroy, and prose that perfectly balances description, action, and dialogue.  A Game of Thrones is, in many respects, a retelling of the War of Roses, and owes a great deal of its greatness to Frank Herbert's Dune and even Le Morte d'Arthur.  It is a tale of a once heroic king in decline, of a noble family's treacherous rise to power, and another family's attempt to maintain honor and dignity in an increasingly corrupt world.  There is, to be sure, a minimal amount of traditional \\"fantasy\\" elements, although there are both dragons and un-dead wights enough to satisfy most fantasy fans.  Those who enjoy hefty historical tomes like Shogun will adore this one as much as those who worship Tolkien.<br />If there is any bothersome flaw, it is that the perspective changes with each chapter, and each chapter is emblazoned with the name of the character featured in it.  Some may find this change in perspective irritating, but I found it refreshing. 800 pages of the same viewpoint would be too much.  Nor is Martin a Harry Turtledove, who stays with a character for four pages, not to return for another 50.  Readers should also be warned that the violence and sex is graphic at times, but less so than most Hollywood movies or romance novels.<br />All in all, this one is a keeper.  The negative reviews have me scratching my head.  I have seldom read a book that fires the imagination as much as this one has.  Recommended without reservations.
B000002I25|4.0|I'm seventeen years old. So you'd expect me to listen to a lot of death metal, rap and probably a little garage on the side.<BR>Well, I like a bit of gothic music, and some rap is kinda good, I guess. But musically I like to look back. The late sixties, very early seventies are my favourite period in music.<BR>The Doors are my favourite rock group and this, their self-titled debut album is my favourite of their records.<BR>It starts off with the classic 'Break On Through (To The Other Side)', ushered in by John Densmore's jazz drum play, quickly followed by Robbie Kreiger's heavy bossa nova style blues riff. Jim Morrison then appears for the first time with the immortal Blake-ian lines: You know the day destroys the night/Night divides the day/Tried to run/Tried to hide/Break on through to the other side. Ray Manzarek takes up the solo with his signature Vox organ, playing some splendid latin jazz lines soaked in reverb.<BR>'Soul Kitchen' is next. A nice blues song with the ever present poetically mature lyrics of Morrison. 'The Crystal Ship'follows and is one of my favourite tracks on the album. Its a beautiful kinda sleepy soundscape, with some classical interplay with the piano. The lyrics are just great: Before you slip into unconsciousness/I'd like to have another kiss/Another flashing chance at bliss/Another kiss/Another kiss. <BR>'Twentieth Century Fox' is another bluesy cut, and is similar to 'Soul Kitchen'. Kreiger's solo is nice and his opening salvo gives it a sweet touch. The next track 'The Alabama Song (Whiskey Bar)' is a kinda incongruous but intersesting cover of the Brecht & Weill song. Manzarek uses a little keyboard device called a Marxophone on it which makes the whole sound even stranger and distant.<BR>After that comes 'Light My Fire' the Grande Fromage of the Doors' catalogue. It's the full version, with Manzarek and Kreiger's interweaving baroque meets Iberian meets blues soloing. Absolutely essential!<BR>'Back Door Man', another cover of a Willie Dixon song is superb. 'I Looked At You' is a much poppier affair. 'End Of The Night', another of my favourites is fantastic. Weird and very reverberate, with Kreiger's economic and always stunning bottleneck style coming to the fore (though nothing in comparison to the solo on 'Moonlight Drive' on the next album).<BR>'Take It As It Comes' is another example of Manzarek's baroque leanings, and is a faster paced song.<BR>Finally the song ends aptly enough with 'The End'.<BR>This is just incredible. With this finale this album was one of the first records, I think, to have explicit language committed to tape. The song is basically an Indian-style raga, with Morrison enunciating and screaming out his ever evocative ideas and rambling poetically. Used in Apocalypse Now. 'Weird scenes inside the goldmine,' says Homer Simpson. It'll leave you with a tingle in your spine and probably a inspired idea or two in your head.<BR>A great album. Four stars and not five? It's not perfect, and there are better albums out there. But it is an essential listen.<br />Was this review helpful to you?
B0000508U6|5.0|I am ashamed to say that I have really not listened much to popular music in recent years.  In fact, I might not have even given this cd a try except that my husband wanted to hear it. I am so glad I did.  It is excellent.  If I had only one descriptive word- it would be 'mellow' - some of the most relaxing and pensive music I've heard.  Think.. long drive on a rainy day.
B000069AUI|5.0|To be honest I have heard these songs over and over on the radio and never bought the album because it was sort of overkill for me to listen to it all. Then I got it this week because, guess what, I missed the tunes! That is a really good sign of an album. I recommend it.
0689835604|4.0|My son loves Karen Katz's flap books.  He loves the interaction and the illustrations.  The only thing I find weird is that on the page when you finding a belly button, you are lifting up another kid's shirt; still, the only body parts shown under the shirt is the belly button.
B0000DJZA5|1.0|>Do you mean Paul's attempts to correct the rewriting of Beatle history in the wake of John's murder? When all the achievements of the Beatles were credited to John by the fans and the press whether he did them or not? <br />Some of Paul's \\"achievements\\" had always been erroneously credited to John, just as some of John's \\"achievements\\" had always been erroneously credited to Paul. For example, my mother once complained that Paul's \\"Yesterday\\" music is much better than John's \\"Yesterday\\" lyric. She assumed when she saw the Lennon/McCartney credit that Lennon wrote (only) lyrics and that McCartney wrote (only) music. (The truth, of course, is that McCartney wrote both the lyric and music to \\"Yesterday\\". Most intelligent critics will agree with my mother that this particular melody is better than this particular lyric. As Lennon pointed out in his December 1980 Playboy interview, McCartney is quite capable of writing good lyrics when he puts his mind to it. The problem is, Lennon continued, that he very seldom puts his mind to it.) This is sort of confusion is not at all what I mean. <br />Naturally some of John's eulogy (immediately after his death) was exaggerated and confused, just as some of your eulogy will inevitably be. McCartney is using THAT bit of nothing (clumsily and transparently) as a pretext. He isn't \\"correcting\\"; he is LYING THROUGH HIS TEETH. Compare what he admitted in interviews prior to Lennon's murder (when he knew he could get away with far less) to what he has said afterward. McCartney rewrites history and then hypocritically calls those who question that rewriting \\"revisionists\\". George Bush does precisely the same thing.
B0000DJZA5|5.0|I'm a 'recent' beatle fan, I have the 'Let it Be' LP and the old CD, and this is so much better. The sound is very good and the new edition is better than the old one. Two of Us is awesome and For you Blue sounds better. The Long and W Road is the most 'changed' song in the album. The Spector version it's one of my favourite Beatles songs, but this 'new' version is very very good too. Every fan of the Beatles must have this CD.
B000066AXE|5.0|Another great movie with great acting, and another review from dvdowner showcasing once again how he doesn't know acting, talent, and is just trashing good stuff for the heck of it. Pathetic.
B0000024V2|5.0|Sweet lord.  Five stars is not an adequate rating for this recording.  Buy this disc now.  Buy it for &quot;Fast life rider&quot; alone. Johnny and the boys hit a groove so stupendous, and tear it up on that song so astonishingly that you wish the song would never end. Quite simply put, this is one of the best hard blues albums ever recorded. And then there's &quot;Memory Pain&quot;...and &quot;Hustled down in Texas&quot;... whew, man. <br />Thank me later.
B000002OR4|5.0|I myself am a violinist. I remembered in eighth grade, my school orchestra chose Schindler's List as one of our pieces for a big performance. When I read and played the notes on my violin, I was shocked at how magnificent this piece was. It was so touching that I nearly cried in front of the entire orchestra! <BR>   When I went home and told my parents about this, my mother gave me our Schindler's List Soundtrack (I never knew we had one) and I listened to it. It was marvelous. It was so incredibly beautiful but so depressing, depressing to the point where the melancholy just melts your heart. When I heard the famous Itzhak Perlman's violin solos, I wish so badly that I am just as skilled and talented as he is (Unfortunately, I'm not. I've only been promoted to 1st violin just recently).<BR>   I loved all the songs in there, but when I heard Remembrances with Itzhak Perlman (track 13), I couldn't help it. I had to cry. And I actually thought that it was not just any sad feeling, but it really feels like as though I'm trying to remember something very personal that I had forgotten for a long time.<BR>   Do yourself a favor and at least listen to this track.
0688163173|5.0|Dennis Lehane proves again his impressive writing skills in this finely crafted, atmospheric and gripping suspense novel.<br />This book is remarkable book which makes you feel that you are actually on Shutter Island, the descriptions are so finely written that you lose yourself on this eerie island where things are not what they seem...<br />The surprises are multiple in this book, they deal with code-breaking, dark and light images of Man's subconscious and action in the real world that leaves you begging for more.<br />An excellent novel that pulls you into a strange world and only lets you out on the very last world.<br />Shutter Island awaits...
B000094A6A|1.0|You can't give it 0, ZERO, NADA Stars, so I had to give it 1.  What a piece of crap!!!  This was such a waste of time!! If you want to see something funny, it would be wise to invest your money on Animal House instead!  Vince Vaughn(Beanie) is about the funniest thing in the movie, along with the brief scene with Andy Dick!!  Other than that, a real yawner.  Let's see an underage high school girl....that's right it was done in Animal House.  A Dean that is going to shut down the so-called Frat....yep, Animal House again.  Big party with a band....Snoop Dog....bad replacement for Otis Day....oh yes, Animal House again.  An elderly pledge dies....Animal House had a horse die in the Deans office, basic rip-off, slight change.  Will Farrell gets drunk and streaks!!  Whoppie, not funny!!  I have a copy I am willing to give away!  I heard how great it was so I bought it without having seen it at the movies.  That is 90 minutes of my life I can never get back!!!  The laughs are few, and very far between here......AVOID!!!
0425098478|5.0|Is there a short, easy-to-read management book that can be really useful to the businessman but also helpful for the housewife and in the conduct of family affairs? Is it possible to squeeze into 100 pages enough valuable information so that it serves a multiple audience and could even be a guide for raising children? This book is based on techniques occupying one minute. Concentrating on three core issues, the author first concentrates on goals. In the business world goals would probably be getting more bang for the buck or more widgets per shift or greater efficiency; in the home goal setting can start with children making the bed, keeping the bedroom tidy or clearing up afterwards. Goal setting is only successful if both parties buy into it - boss and employee or parent and child. Agreeing on objectives, expressing them concisely as bullet points, and setting a time frame may take more than a minute but they can be reviewed rapidly and without dispute. The other two core issues - praise or reprimand - follow naturally and each party knows in advance what it will be. There are no surprises. <br />You can easily read this book and map out your strategy in an evening. It is difficult to imagine that anyone could not find this book helpful in some part of their life.
B00005IC2H|5.0|I love Sigur Ros, but I have to chuckle at all the reviewers on this page who breathlessly anoint them the inventors of a whole new style of music. This band's style is not groundbreakingly new, but rather its exact opposite--unashamedly retro. Seriously. Anyone possessing a passing familiarity with the pre-&quot;Dark Side of the Moon&quot; releases of Pink Floyd (especially Umma Gumma, Live at Pompeii, Atom Heart Mother, or Meddle) will have no trouble figuring out where Sigur Ros gets their inspiration from.<br />Is this a bad thing? Absolutely not. Quite the contrary, I never thought I would hear anyone who could scale the majestic, otherworldy heights of classic early Floyd, but Sigur Ros are worthy successors.  Agaetis Byrjun is a masterpiece, a colossal composition of such surpassing beauty that words literally cannot do it justice. You'll notice that a large number of reviewers struggle to put this album into words, and end up describing it in terms of the visual images the music conjures up for them. For me, the image would be sitting on top of Cadillac Mountain on the coast of Maine and watching the sun rise out of the Atlantic Ocean. <br />Does that make any sense? Probably not. All I can say for certain is that Agaetis Byrjun is an antidote to the soulless crap currently infesting popular music. It is music to be played over headphones in the dark late at night; it is music to be played while sitting on top of a mountain. You will cry at least once when listening to this. You will feel inspired and renewed while listening to this. <br />Sigur Ros have managed to record the cosmos.
B0000VCZK2|5.0|You Know I'm really tired of people bashing Alien(3) I think this film was excellent, it brought back the claustrophobic fear of the first film, it was dark and atmospheric, stylishly directed, very gothic. I always knew there was a large portion of this film that was edited before it's release in theaters, too many plot holes near the middle and later in the film (fortunately restored). The nerds dislike this movie because Mr. Fincher killed off Ripley at the end(much to my dismay), I thought it was a powerful and moving moment and somehow strangely appropriate. My advise &quot;Get Over It Nerds!!!&quot;.  Now Nerds let's talk about the real turkey in this bunch(Alien Ressurection), I remember sitting in the theater waiting in anticipation for the movie event of that year(at least for me it was) I was so excited!, after the film ended I was so ticked off! IT WAS ABSOLUTE S#!#!!!!!!!,a massive pustule, an abomination, a cancerous sore, garbage on a grand scale. The writing was incondite and sloppy, the acting was the pits, chessy special effects, just horrible in every aspect, they had turned one of my favorite francise's(Alien) into a bombastic Commercial travesty! with no redeeming memorable value! My GOD it was STUPID!, STUPID!, STUPID!, STUPID!. There I vented. Buy this DVD for the first three films they're worth the price alone. Just forget the forth, as far as I'm concerned this trashy film doesn't even exist!.
0393037010|2.0|There are good solid reasons why many readers rave about \\"Master and Commander.\\"  The battle scenes are exciting, a couple of the characters are intriguing, the historical background is interesting, and the voyage around the Mediterranean is sort of fun.  That said, the novel isn't for everyone.  I found myself too bogged down by the quirky period dialogue and arcane nautical terms to derive much enjoyment out of this book.  To boot, the plot seems pretty thin (although things thicken up a bit towards the end).  I think it would be best to judge \\"Master and Commander\\" after reading several books in the series.  But after reading the first, I don't feel compelled to plow through any more.
B000002KNY|5.0|Psychotic ranting set to snappy tunes...probably my all-time #1 favorite album.
B000000W9Z|4.0|Listen to this CD in 2050 and I think it will fit in nicely...
6304806434|1.0|What can I say about this except DON'T WASTE 2 HOURS OF YOUR LIFE WATCHING IT! Honestly I've seen some bad films and this has got to be up there in the top 5, probably number one....need I say more.
B00008H2LB|5.0|Look its alot of people hating on Linkin Park.  If you are a punk rocker don't even mention Linkin Park out of your PUNK MOUTH!!!!!!  Basically they have the same message but and the same sounds but.  Everyone has to admitt that they are an great band.  I am black and if it wasn't for this band I wouldn't be listening to trapt and nickelback, puddel of mudd, incubus Metallica, and Nirvana. This cd is great.<br />Foreword- a probably 13 second introduction but blends in with track 2 Don't Stay.<br />Dont Stay- 9/10  This is a great and off da hook song.  But it isn't the best.  Great Job on Brad with the guitar, and awesome vocals by Chester.<br />Somewhere I Belong- 9.5/10 The first single off this album.  I love it and has great lyrics but it gets old after a while(but thats my opinion).<br />Lying from You- 10/10 Once my favorite song on the album.  It has a great hip hop sound(I once only listened to rap, I guessed thats why i used to love it so much) Mike has great lyrics here, and Chester has great vocals and especially good job by Brad.<br />Hit the Floor- 10/10 Who ever doesn't like this song sucks and can shove it dog.  Even though Mike's Flow doesn't go exactly with the beat. Chester(WOW!!! what a way to scream buddy) Hard song to sing along with.<br />Easier to Run- 8/10  I just got this CD and this song will take a while to grow on me like the remix version of pushing me away did. But anyway great song, it justs needs time to grow on me.<br />Faint- 10/10  The second single on this extrodinary album.(Give this thirteen year old credit, he got taste).  Chester screamed his lungs out on the \\"HEAR ME OUT NOW\\" and this song has gotten great response from many.<br />Figure.09- 9.5/10  This took a while to grow on me.  Everytime I watched my \\"Live in Texas\\" Dvd i used to skip it but now I anticipate it and has a great verse by Mike.<br />Breaking the Habit- 10/10  Anyone has to admitt this song is awesome. Or how my fellow black homies would say \\"Thats Killingda game dog\\"  But it did have to grow on me a little also.<br />From the Inside- 8/10  Good song but I grew tired of it kinda quickly.  But props to Chester for the great vocals.<br />Nobody's Listning- 10.5/10 One word \\"WOW!!!!\\"  Like I have menitoned I mostly liked rap before Linkin Park.  This reminds me of the old hip-hop days before dudes started talking bout they money and chicks.  The Chorus Blends in with the song greatly<br />Session- 7.5/10 Ok but has nothing on Cure for the Itch Session is somewhat boring to me.<br />Numb- 10.5/10 The recently released third single.  This song is so great.  I come to school and everyone thats black and listens to Lil Jon, comes up to me singing \\"I become so Numb\\".  Everyone pretty much likes this song.  Especially if you can convert Lil Jon Fans over.<br />Overall this is one of the best cds I have ever heard before in my life.  This Album is not the best but I love it and listen to it over and over.  All your haters stop hating.
B0000C9ZLD|5.0|The Strokes are amazing. They're not your average N'Sync-type band. These guys work hard at what they really seem to enjoy doing which is simply playing/writing/making beautiful music, and it shows on this CD. This cd is simply magnificent. Songs such as &quot;Reptilia&quot; take me away to a far off place that no other song had taken me to since the Red Hot Chili Peppers' &quot;Other Side.&quot; This CD= PURE GREATNESS!
B000002KDX|5.0|I've got something like 500 CDs and vinyl albums.  This is one of the most played.  I couldn't find it the other day and was like doing withdrawals, man!  (:Not really!:)<br />Reminiscent of &quot;Crosby, Stills and Nash,&quot; America relied on three usually accoustic lead guitars and beautiful multilayered harmonies.  The album is somewhat over-engineered, has somewhat limited dynamic range, lacks the complexity of CSN, the depth and innovation of Joni Mitchell, and is not as introspective as James Taylor's best work.  However, it makes up for its shortcommings with some excellent song writing, warmth and precision.  Except for &quot;I Need You,&quot; one of the album's two hits, the album doesn't miss.  &quot;Riverside,&quot; &quot;Sandman,&quot; &quot;A Horse with No Name,&quot; and &quot;Donkey Jaw&quot; show that an accoustical band can really rock out.  Other songs including &quot;Three Roses,&quot; &quot;Children,&quot; and &quot;Here&quot; start out as slow accoustical pieces and build or break into high energy accoustic rockers.  The rest of the album contains nicely recorded accoustic works.<br />While I don't consider this to be one of the top ten albums of all time, it certainly would be one of the 10 I would take if I were stranded on the proverbial deserted island.  I hope Warner Brothers brings it out on DVD-Audio soon.
B00009RDG9|3.0|I will start off by saying that I expected a little bit more from this movie, especially since Tommy Lee Jones usually is a guarantee of a good movie. Benicio Del Toro has also done some pretty good movies in the past. This movie is mediocre. The plot is old, and I would say pretty much used up.<br />The movie is about the ex-special forces trainer L.T. Bonham (played by Tommy Lee Jones) being called in to assist the FBI in tracking down an elusive killer. Several deer hunters have been viciously murdered in the woods of Oregon and Washington, and it appears to be the work of a skilled assassin. L.T. takes on the task of tracking down Aaron Hallham (Benicio Del Toro), which in his past life (working for the military as a civilian expert) he has trained in survival and assassination techniques.<br />The whole movie is full of little annoying glitches that take away from the credibility of the movie and makes it all seem quite far-fetched, occasionally even bordering on corny. It is a cross between \\"The Fugutive\\" and \\"First Blood (Rambo),\\" but sadly, it doesn't hold a candle to either.<br />There is the bad boy that is a highly skilled killing machine that is running around in the woods and in the city (Did anyone say Rambo?), being chased by the good guy, which has almost superhuman tracking skills (The Fugitive?).<br />I enjoyed the action in the movie, and the actors are good. Ordinarily this would be exactly my type of movie, but due to the corny plot and poor execution, I only give it 3 stars!!!
B000099T2L|1.0|Nothing but Destiny's Child with the other to band members out to lunch. While Beyonce hogs the camera.
B00006BTCA|5.0|The comparisons with Joy Division go no further than the baritone voice and an 80's sound.  JD had a matter of fact delivery and detachment more similar to Johhny Cash and Jim Morrison than Interpol, whose music moves from level to level with perfectly crafted precision.  It doesn't just sit there and plod along from one depressing thought to the next like Joy Division.<br />Yes, the Interpol sound is an 80's sound.  The genuis of the music is the composition, what they do with the sound.  Not the Smith's, the Fur's or any band from that era put together an album from start to finish that can stand up to this.  What albums can?<br />Nevermind, The Bends, Automatic for the People.  That's about it in the last 12 years.  If you don't own this album you should.  This band is going to be the band of this generation. Songwriting genious is what this game's about and TOTBL amazes at every turn and twist. Who are these guy's anyway and how did they get so smart so quickly?  This is a perfect CD. Enjoy!
0783225849|5.0|Alfred Hitchcock guarded the plot of PSYCHO against publicity, and in 1960 audiences came to the film without being able to anticipate the unexpected twists and turns of the plot.  More than forty years later, the movie's fame is such that even those who have not seen it are often able to sketch the basic outline of the story in a few words.  This demonstrates the film's fame; what demonstrates it quality, however, is the fact that even those who know the plot before seeing it are seldom disappointed.<br /><br />Very loosely based on Robert Bloch's pulp novel, which was itself very loosely based on killer Ed Gein, PSYCHO presents us with the tale of Marion Crane (Janet Leigh)--who, in a moment of madness, steals forty-thousand dollars.  Running scared, Marion checks into the out-of-the-way Bates Motel.  And there, as the DVD production notes gracefully state, she becomes the most grossly inconvenienced hotel guest in cinema history.<br /><br />The late 1950s and early 1960s saw a deluge of low budget and badly made films that commanded box office business via tawdry subject matter, and according to lore director Alfred Hitchcock was curious to see what might happen if he himself made such a film--but made it well.  Working with a remarkable script and gifted cast and crew, the result was a masterpiece.  Although it is often described as a horror film, PSYCHO is less horror than it is a study in paranoia and suspense, and certainly a lesson in the fact that one need not bother with graphic gore or big budgets to impress audiences.<br /><br />Much of the film's success is in its detail.  Joseph Stephano's script is memorable for its repetition of verbal motifs and its extremely disquieting tone; Bernard Herrman's famous all-strings score builds tremendously upon it.  The simple yet meticulous sets communicate building unease, and the strangely flat, semi-documentary black and white cinematography has a voyeuristic edge that is extremely disturbing.<br /><br />There are elements that can be justly criticized--moments at which the script sounds a false note or characterizations seem a bit artificial--but these small points fade against the overall power of Hitchcock's vision, a vision that here makes viewers squirm even when there seems nothing tangible on screen to squirm about.  But in the end, this is the film for which Janet Leigh, Anthony Perkins, Vera Miles, and John Gavin will forever be remembered... and one of the several films that will forever be associated with one of the twentieth century's most masterful directors.<br /><br />This DVD largely restores PSYCHO to its original form.  Although the first few minutes of the print show wear and tear, for the most part it is remarkably pristine and (after years of pan and scan television broadcasts) is returned to its original ratio.  While there is no audio commentary track, the DVD package includes the original trailer with Alfred Hitchcock, extensive production notes, and an extremely impressive documentary that includes numerous interviews, newsreel footage, production photographs, storyboards, and the like.  Even if you have the film on VHS, you'll likely want to purchase the DVD.  Strongly recommended.<br /><br />GFT, Amazon Reviewer--moments at which the script sounds a false note or characterizations seem a bit artificial--but these small points fade against the overall power of Hitchcock's vision, a vision that here makes viewers squirm even when there seems nothing tangible on screen to squirm about.

B00005TT77|3.0|If you are a real Beatles' fan, I would stay away from this albumn.  There is only a few high points on this albumn.  The remaining of the albumn is a butchering of some classic and great hits.  IF you are a Sarah, Sheryl or Vedder fan, I would recommand this albumn for these songs.  Only two other songs outside of the done by three above is worth listening to, the one done by the Wall Flowers and the other done by Nick Cave.  Outside of that, I would pass on this albumn.
B000068PQ0|5.0|Thought of as a one-hit wonder by many for their sole hit from 1993 \\"She Don't Use Jelly\\", The Flaming Lips once again prove that radio play doesn't matter.  Though it may not be as amazing as their 1999 masterpiece The Soft Bulletin, Yoshimi Battles the Pink Robots is yet another album by the Lips that will be stuck in your CD player for months.  In Yoshimi, the Lips generate some of the most memorable melodies ever heard on CD, and convey powerful emotion in lyrics that are simple yet accessible to even the casual listener.<br />Track one, Flight Test, begins your adventure with a catchy tune about standing up for your emotions where Wayne Coyne utters the most memorable line of the CD in \\"I thought there was a virtue in always being cool.\\"  Track three, the title track (part one), though perhaps not lyrically deep, is still quite a treat to the ears and will have you tapping your feet and snapping your fingers.  In the Morning of Magicians (track five) starts off fast paced and breaks into a beautiful, slow, orchestral melody behind lyrics exploring the futility of love.  Track nine, Do You Realize? is perhaps the closest thing to a mainstream radio song on the album, but does it with style only the Lips can accomplish.  Yoshimi Battles the Pink Robots takes you on an emotional ride that can only be fully appreciated when experienced from cover to cover.  <br />Like The Soft Bulletin, there may not be any top mainstream radio hits on this CD, but maybe it's better that way.  For once you've listened to the entire CD all the way through, you'll feel like you've found something so incredible that the rest of the world just doesn't get.  And the truth is, you have.
B00005QGAT|5.0|There aren't a whole lot of albums that can compare to Off the Wall, which is a well crafted, jazz/disco/soul/rock/r&amp;b blended with the finest of ingredience.  Here's the recepie:<br />1.  Two cups of an energetic, ambitious young dreamer.  (mj)<br />2.  A dash of the wisdom and creativity of an aging virtuoso (Quincy Jones)<br />3.Three magic spoonfulls of the master harpooner/producer (Bruce Sweiden.)<br />3.Add a pinch of recording time, and shake well.  <br />4.Let age with time.  Will come out better each time you whip one up.
B0000TB05A|5.0|A long time U2 fan, I treated myself to &quot;Live...Slane Castle&quot; for Christmas.  In a nutshell, the DTS audio version of this is fantastic.  If you don't own a DTS player and receiver, go get one.  PCM stereo is fine but hold on to your seat when DTS is selected.<br />The Elevation DVD, from Boston a few months earlier, lacks the energy and passion that this concert has.  Plus, it lacks DTS.  Bono is more engaged with the Slane crowd, too; &quot;Sunday Bloody Sunday&quot; actually means something to this crowd.<br />Vocals are clean.  Video editing is great.  You believe you're actually in the crowd.  I've watched this over and over.<br />Did I mention DTS surround?
B00000373U|5.0|I heard 5 songs and I don't have to listen to anymore to tell you this is a beautiful album made by a wonderfully talented man, who died to young at his own hands.Elliot's singing is really perfect for the music, and it just kinda draws you in and makes you want to hear more and more. I really like Behind the Bars. I'm just kinda upset I didn't get a chance to listen to Elliot Smith before he passed away. Rest In Peace.
B0000DD7LB|5.0|I must admit that the first time I listened to the album..I wasn't quite impressed (I thought what's this? there's more of those digital effects going on in some of the songs, britney mostly talks and whispers in another song or two, and sometimes her voice is overshadowed by sounds) but after the 3rd and 4th listen..it's not that bad though and it does have a few cool, hot, fun, and rocking numbers..the songs are a new and a bit different for Britney to sing..there's a variety of genre and musical vibe/incorporation: Hip Hop (I got that) Boom Boom; R&B Outrageous; Reggae (The Hook Up); Pop (Me Against the Music) seasoned with Asian beats that makes the songs appear refreshing..she does sound like Kylie Minogue (Breath on me) and Madonna in this record..Overall is a nice and fun album to listen to..definitely it's Britney's best album..good she made the change..I'm not convince by her vocal ability but she does rock in her own way..
B00008J4P5|5.0|is it led zeppelin? sounds like it often, rocks like it often, but it aint. this cd is one of the tops of 2003. and this comes from a non-zeppelin fan. straight up rock and roll with no pretenses.
0345409671|1.0|I have read nearly all of Anne Rice's vampire/witch chronicles and fell in love with the stories.  A friend and I trade the books and can't wait to discuss each new twist, however, Memnoch will not be one which we will ever read again.  This book was dreadfully wordy and the story was awful.  There was nothing about this book which will lead me to read it again.  After I finally reached the mid-point of the story I began skimming the paragraphs just to get through.  I have never done this with any other Anne Rice book.  I cringe whenever anyone asks me what I thought of this book and quickly refer them to The Witching Hour, Blackwood Farm, Blood and Gold, Interview with the Vampire, etc. as those books are where Anne writes a wonderfully absorbing tales.  Don't bother with Memnoch.  Future stories do refer back to ideas and scences in this book but it is just not worth spending the time to struggle through this book for the minor mentions in other books.
B00008OLYN|5.0|**WARNING** <BR>This is not a Heavy Metal CD. This is not the Opeth you are use to hearing. This is an accustical, clean vocal release.  <BR>================================================= <br />To start, I was completely shocked when I first hear this. I was shocked at how wonderful it is. It blew me away....<br />No growling vocals, no brutal \\"Death Metal\\" riffs, just pure beauty. It's very spooky, being almost all accustic and having some great melodic guitar solos. The vocals are all clean, and contain emotion rarely expressed by Opeth as a Metal oufit. These are some of the most beautifully structured songs I've ever heard Opeth perform....<br />This CD was a true treat IMO. Something completely out of left field, but yet so impressive, it deserves very high recommendation. This is the mellow side of Opeth, and it's a true masterpiece IMO. Highly Recommended.
B0000009S3|5.0|This album came out of nowhere. FZ made this album after having disbanded the original Mothers of Invention, but before assembling the 200 Motels Mothers. The direction Zappa was taking with this album is more akin to what he was trying to accomplish in the latter days of the original MOI. Its a serious jazz fusion record, but this time without the Mothers antics. Zappa collaborted with MOI mainstay Ian Underwood, a brilliant woodwind player and keyboardist, jazz violinist Don Sugarcane Harris, blues bassist Max Bennet and his comrade, drummer John Guerin. This is a tight ensemble -- and Hot Rats, make no mistake, is a musician's album by and for musicians. <br />Other guest appearances include famous jazz violinist Jean Luc-Ponty in his first of several appearances on an FZ album. He plays a small part on \\"It Must Be a Camel.\\" Johnny Otis's son, Shuggie Otis, who plays bass on \\"Peaches En Regalia,\\" and last, but by no measure at all least, Captain Beefheart.<br />The opener, PEACHES EN REGALIA, needs no real introduction. Now a jazz standard, its probably Zappa's best known song. And for a good reason. It is among the most efficiently and intelligently composed, succinct pieces that he ever wrote. This version, with FZ and Underwood's painstaking arrangement, is the first and best of its incarnations. But if you came for that marvelous gem, you'll stay for WILLIE THE PIMP. This monster features the incomparable four-and-a-half octave range Capt. Beefheart howling out in the most incredible manner the only vocals on the album, after which FZ blasts into a 7 minute guitar solo. <br />This is the first album in which Zappa takes his guitar playing seriously -- this solo, the first of many lengthy explosions on this album, is the kind of solo only a guitar player, perhaps, could fully appreciate. There's little of the burning-quick fretwork and pretentious high-register runs one associates with rock guitar. Instead, Zappa's solo, here and on the rest of the album, is methodical, heavy on rhythm and clinging strongly to the melody. Technique takes the place of speed, and meaningless spurts are replaced by what seems like incredible spontaneous composition. This kind of solo is what separates Zappa from the Jimmy Pages of the world. <br />The next piece, SON OF MR. GREEN GENES, is remembered most now for having started the (false) rumor that FZ was the son of the children's TV personality. Its the same as Mr. Green Genes on the Uncle Meat album, but arranged for a small wind ensemble and serving as a vehicle for another beautiful FZ solo -- this one considerably less aggressive than in Willie, but with no less merit. LITTLE UMBRELLAS is akin to Peaches, in that its a short, to-the-point jazz piece. Its a lethargic, loungy number with a strange quality, and an even more bizarre percussion run. An absolutely beautiful piece that never seems to get the attention it deserves.<br />The 17 minute GUMBO VARIATIONS (expanded 5 minutes in digital remix from the original vinyl) is straight jazz, each member of Zappa's combo getting their solo, starting with a furious 7 minute onslaught by Underwood on sax, followed by a fiery Sugarcan Harris violin solo, an acidic, cut-throat Zappa solo, and a bass/drum duet with Bennet and Guerin. The closer, IT MUST BE A CAMEL, is a bit like Peaches or Umbrellas, but with a Zappa twist. This is a short jazz piece mutated with abrupt rests, odd tempo changes, and a difficult time signiture. The hero of this piece is Ian Underwood, with some remarkable sax and keyboard playing. John Guerin gets some spotlight too, with some short, sporadic drum solos, accompanied by FZ's percussion.<br />This is an incredible album, accessible to almost everyone (Its true that this is the \\"FZ album that even people who hate FZ like\\"). One of the great masterpieces of Jazz fusion of all time and, although Zappa made several more masterpieces in the genre (One Size Fits All, Roxy, Grand Wazoo, Waka/Jawaka...) none of those albums, even if the music on some of them is technically more impressive, touch on a certain quality that this album has. Hot Rats sounds like a musician's labor of love, and is a unique masterpiece in FZ's catalogue. I love this album -- and though it was the first of the 50+ albums I've purchased, its still the one I play the most. <br />Absolutely essential, not just for Zappa fans. Play it until you know the solos by heart, or your CD player burns out.
B00005JLR6|5.0|a poigant look at an immigrant families struggle to get over the death of their child. this was a great film from start to finish. well-acted, well told.
B00006RCNW|5.0|This is one of the best series I have ever seen on Tv. An instant ass kicking classics.
0385507755|5.0|I just finished reading A Million Little Pieces for the 2nd time, almost 7 months after being blown away by it the 1st time.  This book makes you feel angry, exhausted, scared, relieved, and even happy.  The point is that it makes you think and feel at a time when so much liturature does just one or the other, but rarely both.<br />I highly recommend buying and reading this book at least twice.
B00009Y2K9|5.0|A mixed between Cuba and Spain<br />This is a wonderful mix between the Cuba's Latin rhythms with the Spain \\"cante jondo\\" of the ancient Flamenco music.<br />The parts are incredibly music communion a master piano player as Bebo Vald&eacute;s and a great Flamenco voice as  Diego Cigala.<br />It's a listening pleasure, full of feelings, good repertoire and excellent recording. Even you can find a beautiful Tom Jobin song
B000005Z0E|4.0|This is one of the best albums I own, and I dont mean only 2pac. Compared to many other rappers he made a relly strong debut. <BR>The album starts up with \\"Young Black Male\\", a track which talks about life on the streets, cash, women and sex. Its not my favorite track but its ok. <br />My personal favorite on this album would be Soulja's Story, in which Pac raps almost demonically in the beginning. The way he changes his voice, its almost scary. <br />Another nice song is \\"Crooked A** N*ggaz. Its got added rhymes of the NWA stars Eazy-E, Ice Cube and Dr. Dre in it, from thier album \\"Straight Outta Compton\\", along with a strong preformance from Stretch. Tupacs rapping on this song is not the strongest he has ever done, but its clearly approved. A couple of more really good tracks are \\"Brenda's Got A Baby\\" and \\"Words of Wisdom\\". <br />If you like 2pac this is the album to buy first, along with \\"All Eyez On Me\\". He hasnt done any bad albums, but buy the original albums before the remixed ones which has come out after his death.<br />TUPAC R.I.P
B0000UHFC6|5.0|I have the most horrible hobbit, excuse me, HABIT of getting a soundtrack and skipping to songs I know or want to hear. When I picked up ROTK from my local Borders and put in my CD player, I didnt skip any song, and I listened from start to finish. This soundtrack was absolutly amazing. Billy Boyd's work on &quot;The Stewerd of Gondor&quot; brought tears to my eyes. And Anne Lenox's prefomance for &quot;Into the West&quot; was absolutly mezmorizing. I highly recomend seein the movie, then buying this soundtrack to fully understand the beauty of Howard Shore's &quot;Lord of the Rings: Return of the King&quot;.
0375703764|5.0|This is one of my favorite books. It's one that I can reread and always find new things. It's one of the most complex and unique books. I can't even describe it. But buy it, and read it...and invest in a good tape measure.
6304798482|4.0|Don't ask me why, but I enjoyed this movie. I didn't care that it was cliched and that the plot had been done over one thousand times. The acting is what carries this from being a bad horror film to one of the best Sci-Fi films since Alien. Though it gets a bit cheesy in the middle it finishes off with a bang. This is a must see for horror lovers and fans of old-fashioned Sci-Fi will definitely fall in love. Even if you're not into any of these, you will find this film impossible to stop watching until the end. The acting is wonderful. Mira Sorvino does her best work here. Charles S. Dutton is fabulous (as always ). I was shocked that Josh Brolin's part wasn't bigger. There is even a cameo by the hot, hunky Norman Reedus. You'll like this film.  Take my word on it and take a chance.
B00008H2LB|5.0|This cd is excellent! In my opinion, it's better than Hybrid Theory. But that cd is awsome too! My favorite song on this cd is Nobody's Listning. It has a very unique sound. I could listen to this cd over and over again without getting tired of it! It's worth every dollar!
B0000C0FJB|1.0|Don't even think about buying this cd. The sound on this cd is the worst that I have ever heard. The whole time you can hear, what seems like 5,000,000 Brazillians, hooting and hollaring. Normaly crowd noise is welcome on a live cd, but they overpower the music. Save your money. Don't say I didn't warn you!!!
B000001OAA|5.0|I adore this CD... it basically lays out what Garbage is all about. Every song is powerful both in lyrics and music, and just very great to listen to. I love everything from Garbage, and this would be my second favorite CD of their's, the Version 2.0 at number one. Still, this one is a 5-satr CD.
B00001U0E1|5.0|I thought it was well made and had some fun parts but was not really moved to say that it deserved all the praise it got...until the last scene with Viola and William (It showed their love was more powerful than I was led to believe from the earlier scenes.) Because of that scene I watched the whole movie again in a new light because I saw true passion in that one scene and so I had to see what led up to it. Now I love it! But the ending had to get to me for that. And maybe it will for you.
B000001Y79|5.0|This is a great CD! In my top two No Doubt CD's for sure, but I don't know if it is one or two. Every song on here is great... my favorites being the powerful Don't Speak, Sunday Morning, I'm Just a Girl, and Happy Now, loving every other song on this CD as well, of course. A must have in every No Doubt fans collection, it is deffinetly a No Doubt classic.
B00008PW3Q|5.0|Good album all the way through, it may not be everything to everybody but there is enough material to keep practically anyone interested for over 1/2 hour...much better than most cds! I personally have no problem listening straight through, Stevies voice isnt quite what it used to be but the style is still there and all very enjoyable.<BR>If you're like me and never really warmed up to Christines music anyway...or if you liked Lindsey's &quot;Out of the cradle&quot; then buy it immediately, this is the cd for you (dvd-audio also)
B00005QDW1|5.0|This is one of the best CD's of all time! It is a mature, yet still funky No Doubt, deffinetly at their best! I just love Platinum Blonde Life, Waiting Room, Start the Fire, In My Head, and Making Out, unfortunatly none as singles. Just an amazing CD!
B0000AQVCL|5.0|this cd is awesome.  even if you dont like the ipod commercial song, you should at least listen to &quot;look what youve done&quot;.  Jet is very unique.
B000060P79|5.0|This cd is great! Their band is very much like Good Charlotte and New Found Glory. My favorite songs on this cd are Worst Day Ever, Meet You There, I'm Just A Kid, You Don't Mean Anything, God Must Hate Me, and I Won't Be There. But I love all of the songs! This cd is worth buying!
B00005T30L|5.0|I thought Ghost World was a VERY cool movie.  I related to it so much.  I could relate to both the girls and the character of Seymour.  I related to the girls because I remember being the way they were ... I remembered having a friend that I was really tight with, went everywhere with etc.  I remember that attitude that went with youth..feeling that I was superior, invincible, that I was cool and everyone else was uncool and just existed to be critiqued and made fun of, even humiliated.  It wasn't that these girls were special in that regard.  That's part of growing up that we all go through to some degree, and we (almost always) eventually grow out of it and learn that we are vulnerable, imperfect, needy, and that other people can be different... and not because they're just losers..and that other people need and deserve respect.  Thora's character grows a little in this kind of way by the end of the movie.  She eventually befriends Seymour and sees a lot that's likeable in him.  And she always made fun of that old man waiting for the bus that never came .. and yet eventually the bus DID come (he was right after all), and at the end of the movie she herself got on the bus (what was once something to ridicule had now become something she understood and wanted for herself).<br />I related to the character of Seymour because I saw myself in him also, more the way I am today ... a loner, an 'older guy' - less attractive than I used to be, 'strange' to younger people, eccentric (a collector of rare music, with a collection almost the same size too), someone younger people tend to ignore or want to make fun of because I can't relate to them as much and no longer look like them or dress like them, but someone who they'd probably think was cool if they took the time to get to know me, like Thora's character started out thinking Seymour was the biggest loser in the world, yet eventually ended up thinking he was cool (ignoring what her friend thought about him, and thinkingfor herself) and she even ended up falling for him, sleeping with him etc.
0345452577|4.0|As a huge fan of early-middle period Alex Delaware novels (sorry, but all the post-&quot;Billy Straight&quot; novels have been weak), I was looking foward to a non-Delaware Kellerman novel. The facts are these: the mystery doesn't work very well. The way the author sets up clues, has his protag investigating this mystery, and his style of plotting are dense, but ultimately unfullfilling if you're a mystery buff. The reason I liked this novel was its main character, Dr. Jeremy Carrier. Kellerman has written a very-believable, three dimensional human who even in the tedious parts of the story, keeps you interested in what's going on. I liked the romance (usually a weak part of a mystery novel) between Carrier and the nurse Angela. Very realistic and interesting. Overall, I'd say that Carrier, his relationship with Angela and Dr. Chess are what kept me into the book. If you're looking for shoot-em-up action packed novels that read like a movie, I suggest anything by James Patterson, Greg Iles, or John Sanford. But most Kellerman fans should be pleased.
B0000TAZBK|5.0|Enough has been said about Howard Shore's masterful, sweeping scores, so I'll cut right to the attraction of getting a boxed set of this amazing trilogy: the aesthetics. The aesthetical value of this boxed set is worth the few extra dollars. The three CD's come in a handsome, high-quality tan box depicting concept art from all three movies. It's a visually pleasing way to keep the soundtracks together and is of impressive quality.<br />There have been so many alternate covers for each CD that, if they were bought separately, it would been a chore to decide on which cover. Luckily, this boxed set comes with 18 &quot;collector cards&quot;. The &quot;cards&quot; are actually 12 x 12 cm, glossy pictures of all the alternate covers of each CD, most of them with pictures on both back and front. They are printed on thin cardboard. Pictures include individual shots of nearly all the characters, both central (Frodo, Sam, Aragorn, Gandalf, Gollum, Legolas...) and secondary (Eomer, Theoden, Denethor, Arwen...) They're nice to have and they are a great way to customize your soundtracks. The booklet in each CD has the main cover of each soundtrack printed directly on it, over which these cards can be slotted if desired.<br />The cards can also double as mini-posters. However, the CD's fit snugly in the box only if the cards are kept in the box as well: all together the cards create a stack about half the thickness of a CD, so without this cushion the soundtracks tend to move around.<br />Nonetheless, I would definitely recommend this set to those who are appreciative of the music from the theatrical versions of the Lord of the Rings trilogy, and who are looking for an attractive set. Be forewarned that future boxed sets will be released containing the music from the Extended versions of the trilogy.
B00005JMGL|5.0|this is the best movie ever! i've seen it so many times i can recite the lines by heart. it is diffrent from the cartoon movie and the book. it has been changed for the complete and total better. i highly recomend this movie to anyone. if you're old enough to talk, see the movie. if you're so old you can't walk, see the movie. if you're anywhere in between, see the movie. just see it before you make any decisions.
0140157247|4.0|With conviction, I can honestly say this was one of the most powerful books I have ever read.  It was a great insight into a very troublesome era.  At times it was even overbearing to read of the many struggles of the Great Depression, and you begin to realize all the things you take for granted every day.  My life and accomplishments seem so trite and insufficient compared to every Joad family that lived through this Great Migration and its aftershocks.  Thanks to this novel, I am, at the least, grateful and blessed to be in this secure place right now.
B00006879E|4.0|SO I heard these guys on VH1 for the first time when I saw their video for 'This Love.'  Then, I went and had a look at their site where you can sample 5 of their tunes.  I got to 'Sunday Morning' and I'm thinking, when did Stevie Wonder get into this.  Well, of course, it wasn't Stevie Wonder, but frontman Adam Levine.  So I come to amazon here, and lo and behold, in the above review, I see the Stevie Wonder comparison - hence, my thunder...gone.  Anyway, go get this CD, I am.  It is a nice blend of R&B and rock.  In addition to the Stevie Wonder comparison, I'm thinking that fans of Jamiroquai will experience deja vu.
B0000DCGT1|5.0|This movie is based on the non-fiction book \\"Seabiscuit\\", by Laura Hillenbrand.  It is a story about three men and how these characters come together to turn an abused, run-down horse into the greatest racehorse in the Depression-era United States.  This movie is not disjointed.  It does like the book does.  It tells us about these three different men individually, about Seabiscuit individually, and ultimately, their lives converging.  Its all part of their story - how their separate lives, tragedies and fortunes or misfortunes bring them to the same place and time.  Its a story with deeper, more abstract, meanings than just a racehorse winning races, so it will probably go over the heads of the less intelligent, or young and immature.<br />As for this movie needing a single viewpoint like \\"Apollo 13,\\" the true story of the Apollo 13 disaster was based on Jim Lovell's book \\"Lost Moon.\\"  Obviously, since it was written from Lovell's point of view, the movie will be from his point of view.  \\"Seabiscuit\\" was written from an objective, third person point of view (Hillenbrand's), therefore, the movie follows suit.
B0000DD7LC|5.0|Wow!  This is a tad better than \\"Songs In\\", very different!  I loved this album!<br />Harlem's Nocturne- A haunting song, yet very beautiful.  I love the small introduction to this song, it's very beautiful the way the piano goes!  I did like \\"Piano & I\\" Just a bit better, but this is still a masterpeice. 5/5<br />Karma- One of my favorites!  This has an extremely R&Bish song.  It talks about a relationship that doesn't need to be reformed.  A cool song with perfect lyrics.  At first it sounded like something a rebel rapper would do, with the instrumentals, but I really got used to it. 5/5<br />Heartburn- This is an interesting choice for Alicia Keys.  It's very hard rockish.  Not my favorite, but very unique just the same.  Alicia certainly knew what she was doing!  This is kind of immature though- I usually skip it. 4/5<br />If I Was Your Woman- This is one of my favorite songs on the album.  The words relate to how I feel at this exact moment.  I love everything about it, except that it's kind of short. 5/5<br />You Don't Know My Name- One of my favorites.  Everything about this song is great except for the talking in the middle.  To me, it just makes the song *yawn* boring.  She totally killed it by doing that.  Instead of making it a normal 4:30 song, it's now expanded to a whopping 6 minutes!  Good, but tacky all the same. 5/5<br />If I Ain't Got You- My favorite on the album.  It's a beautiful love song that talks about how riches don't compare to true love.  Absolutely breathtaking with vocals taken to the very very top. 5/5<br />Diary- This song is boring.  The vocals are good, and the words are good, but it's sort of monotone.  This one doesn't do anything for me. 3/5<br />Dragon Days- I really like this one!  It talks about her bad days, and how the \\"fire's hot!\\"  A cool song, with interesting lyrics.  This song uses metaphors.  It's very unique. 5/5<br />Wake Up- I really like this song.  From the lyrics to the tune, everything is original.  It's a veryinteresting song. 5/5<br />So Simple- One of my favorites.!  I don't find the computerized voice all annoying, and it's not a boring song!  This is a good song for Alicia's voice, and the tune is just right. 5/5<br />When You Really Love Someone- I agree with every reviewer- This is the new Fallin/Woman's Worth, with the lyrics of \\"A Woman's Worth\\" and tune of \\"Fallin'\\"  Beautiful!  Very pure and stright to the point. 5/5<br />Feeling U, Feeling Me- I like the guitar chords, but the rest is kinda pointless.  It was written by Alicia, but there really are no words, except for a two line part towards the end.  OK. 3.5/5<br />Slow Down- I know it's called \\"Slow Down\\" but it is way too slow!  It does have variety, though, and I do like it.  Not the highlight of the album, though. 4/5<br />Samsonite Man- Really, I don't find this song all that great.  It's just another song.  I don't know- It may appeal to others, but it doesn't to me. 3.5/5<br />Nobody Not Really- A terrific interlude, one to definitely think about, with a jazzy tune and words that make you realize about how creul a place this world can be. 5/5<br />That's it!  Now go out and buy it!
B00000255F|5.0|Joy. Hope. Passion. Loss. Love. LIFE.  There is no album before or since that is as poetic, passionate, hopeful, realistic, and universal as this one is. This is before Bruce ever tried to make a &quot;hit&quot;, before he started preaching, before he soured on the world.  If you have ever been young, if you have ever lost your heart, if you have ever seen the world for all of its cruelty and decided to survive anyway, then this music tells your story.  This is quite simply one of the single greatest albums of the modern era. There is nothing quite like it; It is poetry, but for people that do not like poetry. It is art, but for people that don't like &quot;art rock&quot;. It doesn't dance, but it moves. It doesn't fit any formula, but it is familiar. It is universal, but speaks to the individual. It breaks my heart that this work of art is fading away. Do yourself a favor...buy it, try it, and let it become part of your life.
B0000D96NW|5.0|All the previous reviews have been dead on, this is probably the best Machine Head CD yet.  Imperium starts off what becomes a full-on assualt on your ears.  It's definitely worth it to buy the import, don't wait.
B0000024ZT|4.0|And so it begins. \\"Spirits in the Night\\". Is there a better song about being young, going out to \\"party\\"? It is SO much more than sex. Hhits it then, and it still works today. \\"For You\\"? Isn't this so much more \\"real\\" than ANYTHING out there today? \\"Lost in the Flood\\"? Who speaks with this passion anymore?<BR>No, it isn't perfect; no, it isn't his best; no, it isn't \\"essential\\".  But the seeds are planted; It is raw, poetic, soulful, full of the sounds of a man that had NO interest in making \\"hit\\" music; he wanted to say what he wanted to say.  They just don't make many like this anymore.
B000002BBY|5.0|Can the word PERFECT be used to describe this cd? Absolutely. Oasis have been, at one point, called the biggest band in the world. I say they are and always have been the BEST, and this album proves it. (What's The Story) Morning Glory is the standard by which rock n' roll excellence is measured. This album revolutionized the rock genre with classic songs performed by a classic band.  Liam Gallagher's one in a million voice soars over big brother Noel's musical genius. Wonderwall, Champagne Supernova, and Don't Look Back in Anger are three of the greatest songs of all time ever, let alone this album. But don't discount the rest of the album. Sleeper hits including Hey Now, Some Might Say, and the title track (What's The Story) Morning Glory, (I'm already singing along in my head) turn this album from an ok disc with great singles into simply the greatest album I have, or ever will listen to. Pure Genius. Pure Rock n' Roll. Pure Oasis.
B000002513|5.0|A Brilliant sophomore effort! No, this isn't &quot;pop&quot;...it is not traditional AABA songwriting (pay attention kids, I didn't say &quot;ABBA&quot;); but it is a young man with a lot to say.<BR>Do NOT bother if you consider &quot;Born in the U.S.A. to be &quot;early Springsteen&quot;. This is a poet, an artist, a man with nothing to lose playing what he feels. &quot;Kitty's Back&quot;, &quot;Rosalita&quot;, &quot;Incident on 57th St.&quot;, and &quot;Sandy&quot;, all are brilliant, but they have so very little in common with what Bruce became!<BR>I love Bruce today, I love Bruce then. He NEVER tried to make the same album over and over (like, oh, every artist since?), but he said what he felt like saying at the time.  Brillaint, poetic, rocking, touching, songs of life, love, youth, understanding...they are all in this album. Love it for what it is!
B0000039QA|5.0|The Notorious B.I.G. is a classic artist. His work in music is just awesome. His debut &quot;Ready To Die&quot; just got him platinum, and now he is even better. He is one of the most talented artists in the world. On my list, Biggie is no. 2. Coming at no. 1 2Pac. But theye are both awesome. This classic is known for being one of the best selling albums ever. He is now the king of the east. Ands an enemy of Tupac Shakur. All of his albums are classic. A thing about this album, is how there is so many hit singles from it. Like 'Mo Money Mo Problems' and 'Hypnotize' and many more, but those are two of them. Here is my rating of each track:<br />Disk 1:<BR>1. Life After Death Intro - skit<BR>2. Somebody's Gotta Die (10/10)<BR>3. Hypnotize (10/10)<BR>4. Kick In The Door (9.5/10)<BR>5. #!*@ You Tonight (Feat. R. Kelly) (10/10)<BR>6. Last Day (Feat. The Lox) (10/10)<BR>7. I Love The Dough (Feat. Jay-Z &amp; Angela Winbush) (10/10)<BR>8. What's Beef? (9/10)<BR>9. B.I.G. Interlude (10/10)<BR>10. Mo Money Mo Problems (Feat. Mase &amp; Puff Daddy) (10/10)<BR>11. N***as Bleed (10/10)<BR>12. I Got A Story To Tell (9.5/10)<br />Disk 2:<BR>1.

B0000DD7LB|2.0|I have been a fan of Britney Spears since her first album but this new Album called In the Zone is just terrible!  The music is all different types and not many of them even have a good tune for them either.  I like the Song In the Zone and Toxic but that's about it.  The rest is crap, never heard such a bad CD like this from Britney before.  I may not be buying anymore of her CD's if this keeps up in the future.  It was a big disappointment for me too because I requested this CD for Christmas, only to find out, it wasn't half as good as I had expected in the end.  Two thumbs down from me, don't waste your time with this one unless you like a CD with no general format of music.  If you do then buy it because it has R&amp;B, Hip-Hop, Rap and so forth on here.  But for me its just not organized and its not very enjoyable to listen to due to that big mistake right there.
B00009XITR|3.0|I am a huge sucker for British accents, so I went to see this movie the first week it premeered in theaters. Since I have no cable television, Amanda Bynes is a new face for me. Colin Firth is quite convincing as Lord Henry Dashwood, and Bynes, although forced to make some typical American mess-ups as the script mandates, does an admirable job as the young, impetuous, but ultimately caring, good-hearted heroine. I have to say, though, that the best character for me was Oliver James, not because of his acting abilities, which were not thoroughly explored, but his singing voice needs to get more credit. In truth, he should release an album over here in the States. Those two songs on the soundtrack just don't give me enough! Speaking of the soundtrack, I love how they used \\"I Wanna be Bad\\"! I wish they had played the entire song during the film! The caniving, devious step-sister and mother, (rather like Cinderella, don't you think)? are decent as well, and the grandmother is extremely funny in the little screen time she is given. I'd actually recomend this, if only for the British actors, and Amanda Bynes's cute, charming, if a bit chiche, performance.
B00005JMTN|5.0|Did you ever get in trouble as a little kid for failing to pay attention in school, drifting off into your own little world as you probed the dreamy landscapes of your mind with thoughts of fields you'd explore after school or adventures you'd take when the chance came? That was me, and I'm glad to know I'm not alone. Tim Burton and Daniel Wallace have given us a treat with this film, both visually and story-wise.<br />In it, we have a man who finds out his father dying. But all his life, his father has told him personal tall tales as if they were true. The son isn't so sure and it is here, in his investigation, that most of us (if you're in the dreamer camp) become enthralled.<br />I will write no more. If you're like me, you've already begun dreaming what it might be like! ;-)
B000001IQH|2.0|Rancid - ...And Out Come The Wolves (1995)<br /><br />These punks really wear their Clash influence on their sleeves. It's not a bad influence to have; hard-core and ska are worthy genres as well. Rancid do it with conviction and do it well, particularly the bass player.<br /><br />The main problem is I hardly ever make it through this entire CD. There's almost no point because the songs sound so much alike. I can understand people going crazy for this music (at least for a little while), but Rancid's style and songwriting powers, at least on this album, are pretty limited.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Whedon has a way of making strong characters and entertaining interaction between them. This, along with a space background that features more adventure than technology, makes the show unique, surprising and interesting.<br />The western slant is a little too strong but if you can ignore the slightly ridiculous hick-speak the characters sometimes use you will find an outstanding show beneath that would have become a hit if it wasn't mismanaged by FOX.<br />Try it, you'll like it.
B000002KIE|5.0|Yeah, they changed the world and gave rock a swift kick in the..., but cut through all the hype and what you have is an album that ROCKS! I'm not typing to write about the historical importance of this band, their sordid history or to tell you how punk came about. For that, see the excellent documentary THE FILTH AND THE FURY by Julian Temple or get the giant green coffee table book PUNK! which skips the pompous analysis for pictures and quotes from those who lived it.<br /><br />I'm just here to say that when I need to rage against the world I can put this on, blow off major steam and feel rejuvenated, ready to take on anything. People can get caught up in the legend of the Pistols and overlook how great the music is.<br /><br />Maybe the Pistols made basic, primitive rock, but how come I've never heard a guitar snarl and taunt like Steve Jones'? I guess he \\"meant it, man!\\" And Paul Cook's perfect (for the Pistols at least) drumming knocks the energy meter off the scales. Of course, there would be no Sex Pistols without the seething, brooding Johnny Rotton.<br /><br />They supposedly ripped off the Who or whoever, but that's just part of the punk asthetic: just do it, make something out of nothing, do it yourself. To be fair, Glenn Matlock, the original Beatle-loving bass player was key to making these songs happen, but he wasn't a Sex Pistol in spirit so he had to go (in truth, he was a weenie). His replacement, Sid Vicious, was a useless, ultimately tragic figure chosen because he looked the part (how pathetic, really). But everything came together in the best possible way. As Rotten said, \\"The SEx Pistols ended at the right time for the wrong reasons.\\"<br /><br />A few notes on BOLLOCKS .........<br /><br />\\"Bodies\\" is about the most powerful anti-abortion statement I've heard, enough to make me think twice about being pro-choice.<br /><br />\\"God Save the Queen\\" is the one that really had England in an uproar. I like the Brits, but any country that perpetuates a monarchy into the 21rst century is majorly screwed up.<br /><br />\\"Anarchy in the U.K.\\" is probably the best track and has inspired millions to speak out and take a stand.<br /><br />\\"Sub-mission\\" is the only laid back cut and it's good, too. It's also funny - Rotton wrote the lyrics about a \\"submarine mission\\" when manager McLaren asked him to write one about \\"submission\\" (the S&M kind).<br /><br />\\"New York\\" totally ridicules the New York Dolls and the scene where punk supposedly came from.<br /><br />\\"EMI\\" is a clever kiss-off to the label that gave them the boot after something like 1 month (and forking over a tasty severance check in the process, no less).<br /><br />The whole album is most worthy of their legend.<br /><br />Pistols rock!!!!!!!!!!!crewed up.     \\"Anarchy in the U.K.\\" is probably the best track and has inspired millions to speak out and take a stand.    \\"Sub-mission\\" is the only laid back cut and it's good, too.

6305327041|5.0|Quentino Tarantino charges into the world of comedy with fists of fury in one of the most hilarious films I've ever seen. Tim Roth the woeful bellboy finding himself in in the wackiest situations which finishes off with a classic skit involving Roth, Tarantino, and Bruce Willis which is sort of like a grand finale at a fireworks show. A great cast you won't be disappointed by this film unless you have little sense of humor!
0679601686|5.0|I wanted to read Jane Austen's Pride and Predjudice after a friend told me the book was so good. I bought a copy, and I can't say I was disappointed; this is a masterpiece. Austen did a really nice job talking about issues that you and I have trouble with--love, relationships, reputation, pride and prejudice of course--just to name a few.  She did well tying in the love story with Elizabeth Bennet and Fitzwilliam Darcy with all the other characters--even the most frivolous of characters had their part in the story.<br />I really liked the fact that Austen developed the characters/story line between Elizabeth Bennet and Fitzwililam Darcy well. It is evident that the two were made for each other, but Elizabeth, after first bad impressions concerning Darcy and stories by Wickham, never noticed the true character of Darcy because of her predjudice (blindness) towards him. Darcy was just too full of himself until rejection by Elizabeth brings him back to his senses--not so proud now, are we? The roads to the happy ending were often bumpy, but Elizabeth and Darcy (along w/Bingley and Jane) arrived safe and sound, concluding the novel with a sweet ending. At times, the passages are really long/tedious, but in the end, it's worth it.
0312263120|5.0|In the middle of the night David Becker's help is requested by his fianc's boss, the Deputy Director of Operations of the NSA.  Fly to Spain and recover a dead man's belongings.  Right now, the Lear Jet is waiting, and it's a matter of National Security.  Than David's fianc, Susan Fletcher, a genius code breaker employed by the NSA, is called in to work for an emergency.  There is a truly 'Unbreakable' code available on the internet - soon to be auctioned off to the highest bidder, and the only chance the security of the United States has is for Susan to identify the dead man's secret partner.  While in the background, there is now an assassin following David, and Susan is unaware that what she knows is only the tip of an intricate life and death plot.<BR>This was an excellent action/mystery that had me guessing multiple times about who was actually pulling the strings.
0553213105|5.0|The chapter that I liked the best was chapter one because it talks about the Bennet family and describes how the mom (Mrs. Bennet) is really desperate for her daughters to marry a wealthy man. The reason that I liked chapter one is because it gives a brief opening about the book. It was important for the daughters to marry a wealthy man because they wanted to have a better economic status and be exposed to a better society.<br /> The literary device that I appreciated more was comedy. Comedy is a story that ends with a happy resolution of the conflicts faced by the main character. In many comedies the conflict is provided when a young couple who wish to marry are blocked by adults.<br /> I recommend this book for people that like to read books and are interested in how people were in the 19th century.<br /> I like the book because it tells us how families were in the 19th century. The reason that this is important to me is because we could see and compare cultures back then and how we are now.
B000020617|4.0|I thought that this was the most \\"accessible\\" of all the Foo Fighters' albums. The music runs from being hard and heavy (Stacked Actors, Breakout) to mellow and lulling (Aurora, Next Year). The fact that i like both heavy and light music makes this cd easy to listen to, even though there is such a variety. <BR>And, even though it is very good, I thought that some of the last songs were filler and to light for my liking. Good work on the ECD part of the disc; I thought that was a nice gift for fans.
B00006CXXU|5.0|Ok..Christina out does all of the other singers out there. She has the most amazing voice ever. The whole album is great. With everything from rock, pop, dance, and soul...X-tina's got it. Every song on this album is amazing. Just because she shows what she has in 'dirrty'...everyone judges. The whole album is magnificent.  Christina can hit every key...she can go from singing really high to just whispering.  Just because she shows what she got and she's prettier than that, I need attention cuz I have nothing going for me I'm such a ho Spears...you think she can't sing. Well your wrong as hell. Christina is the best singer out there right now.  She can do anything that comes her way. 'Soar' is a great song very inspiring and soulful.  'Can't Hold Us Down' is another great one about the double standard. 'Fighter' is a great rock song.  'Beautiful' is amazing and touching. 'Keep On Singin My Song' expresses her voice so well and she can go so high. 'Get Mine, Get Yours' is another good one..a little provocative but still good. Every song on this album was great! If you dont have this, you really should get it. This album was amazing, and I can't wait for the next.  That whore, Britney Spears, has nothing on Christina!!
0140367357|5.0|E. Nesbit's classic story of about some Edwardian children who find a sand fairy one summer is an unsentimental delight. Each day the odd fairy grants them one magic wish, be it beauty, wealth, great size, etc. which will only last until sunset. Somehow each wish they make turns into a disaster, but through their own cleverness and a bit of luck, the children are able to make each problem work out in the end. Nesbit's writing is particularly full of amusing asides and offbeat humor in this one. Her turns of plot are inventive, and as the plucky children face their outlandish predicaments, it becomes clear that Nesbit has her finger on the pulse of the way real children might think. Her work has held up quite well considering it is over a hundred years old. This novel would be suitable for kids in about fourth or fifth grade.
B0000DD7LB|1.0|Where the hell do I start?  Ok...uh Britney Spears can NOT sing!!! Man she sounds like shes really sick or you know how you talk when you hold your nose...ya that!  Britney tries way to hard.  She really cant sing..aaand she cant act either.  I mean, ya big woop she can dance..but I think everyone could dance like that if they hired someone to teach them. Britney had some good beats to the songs...but she really cant sing worth a damn so its hard to sit there and listen. I mean just cuz she did a song with Madonna, it makes her the queen..ya I dont think so!! The whole album sucks, no wait the only song that was good is 'Toxic'...even though she sounds like shes underwater...or something, its an ok song. The rest of the album sucks though. Another thing that bothers me is that Britney acts so concieted on the album...shes all \\"am i to hot for you tho?\\" and \\"outrageous! my shopping spree. outrageous my sex drive\\"...so not only does she sound concieted buuut she sounds like a ho. So I'm telling you, dont buy it!! ITS A WAIST OF YOUR MONEY!!!
B00005MP58|2.0|Really boring.  Stick with the marvelous, original 1940 classic.  How can A&E's wimpy cast possibly compete with Greer Garson, Laurence Olivier, Edna May Oliver, Ann Rutherford, Edmund Gwenn, et al?  Answer:  they can't.  The 1940 original will be on DVD sooner or later, but in the meantime a decent VHS of this great old movie will at least keep you awake, which is more than I can say for this dreary DVD issue.
B0000DD7NL|4.0|It's just not my style. It reminds me of old school soul. I love the recreation of old styling with a creative new feel to it, but I'd like to see Alicia just go off and do something totally new and original. Definitely a worth while CD.
1577311523|5.0|I have suffered with depression and obbsesive compulsive disorder for years.  I have a religious background, and was taught that we are essentialy bad and have to work hard at being good.  What I was realy being taught was how to be an obedient person who did not question anything.<br />I am a psychology student and realise what depression is about.  If things are going wrong in our life, and it is not the way we want it to be, then we can create a sense of permanence and certainty by retreating into a self made prison of depression.   In our prison we can feel safe and secure, but the cost is high.  A lot of people with mental health problems interact with the world through the medium of depresion.  This medium can restrict the posability of a joyful life, and can reinforce a downward spiral into further depression and posible psychosis (and other mental health problems).<br />The ego part of me wants to stay in this prison, but, &quot;I&quot; do not.  The trouble is, I have spent so long in this prison, that I no longer trust my perceptions and thoughts about the outside world.  My ideas obout the outside have been out of touch.  I am an intravert, and intraverts who have been abused end up having to control, and keep things in order.  Is everything clean, is everything tidy, is everything in order.  A fragile sense of self who's main occupation is to keep chaos at bay by making sure that everything is in its place.  Some will understand what I am saying.<br />I have come to realise that the way out of my prison is in this moment (and no other).  The ego has to let go and embrace what is.  My intuition says to me that Tolle is telling a universal truth.<br />I realise that I am out of touch with reality.  This realisation though is strange and enticing.  I entered into madness because of the preasure i had as a child.  Paranoid power and preasure can distort the way a child constructs the world.  A fantasy construction is a desperate attempt at self preservation,which the child assembles when their is no way out of their predicement.  The family is all they know.  If the family is in a huge power struggle, and the child is  blamed for it,then, what can the kid do but enter into the same denial and madness. <br />(because  parents are ignorent, and do not want to see dysfunction in there &quot;maridge&quot;. They would rather see it in the<BR>child)<br />I am 35, and in the spce of 5 years I have gradualy deconstructed my fantsy world and embrsced the real one.  This is not easy.  The very foundation of who i am is being challenged.  Entering this moment is to be reborn.
B00005JMCN|5.0|I was planning on not liking this movie. I had heard it was too long at the theatre and dull as well. Well I am here to say PISH POSH! There are so many over stylized one dimensional super action sugarless halfcaf  movies assaulting our senses out there any more I think people don't realize when they see the genuine article. Seabuiscuit is a Great story and it TRUE too. It's part of our short history as a nation. And what an inspirational story! I really cared about the characters, wanted to know them. This is an enriching, feel good with no sugar coating movie. I highly recommend it. Horse person or not.
0679879269|5.0|This series just gets better and better. The Amber Spyglass was an excellent ending to my favorite trilogy. <br />I believe that some people see this book as being religiously negative, but it's a Fiction story! The Amber Spyglass is simply letting you into a world of with a completely new religion. <br />I thought that Lyra's transformation into a productive person was evident in this book, and Will also transformed his character. I began hating Lyra in the first book but grew to love her and was in tears by the end. <br />This is an emotional, deep story perfect for all fantasy readers. I strongly recommend this story!
B00003CXD5|5.0|This is a great example of what makes the DVD format so wonderful.  A great, classic movie with wonderful commentaries, intersting short subjects, a cartoon, and many other extras.  The documentary on John Huston is well done and interesting as is the feature on the film itself.  And what a film!  Great acting, writing and terrific direction make this a classic.  The story still holds up today as do the performances of Humphrey Bogart and Walton Huston.  Huston desrved his Oscar that year, and the fact that Bogie was not even nominated has to be one of the all time worst decisions of the Academy.  He is brilliant in his role as the surly, menacing Fred Dobbs.  Everything about this movie works- it deserves its place on AFI's 100 Greatest Movies list.  This is a perfect gift for anyone who loves really good movies.
B00000IOSU|5.0|I became interested in Sarah McLachlan's music with a few of her previous studio albums, \\"Surfacing\\" and \\"Fumbling Towards Ecstasy.\\"  Last night was the first time I played \\"Mirrorball.\\"  What can I say?  It was wonderful.  If you have a truly high-end audio system capable of accurately reproducing what's on this disc, the dynamics on this CD will delight and astound you.  The music and Sarah's voice starts and stops in an instant and it all just seems \\"there.\\"  The closing song, \\"Angel\\" was spectacular.  You know how listening to some music gives you goose-bumps it's just so good?  Well, this song has it in spades.  The range of Sarah's voice was unbelievable and the piano really sounded great.<br />If you like any of Sarah's previous work you really need to buy this CD.  It's 65 minutes of pure, stimulating pleasure.
B000031WD9|5.0|I was about 12 or thirteen at the time I watched this movie, and I heard that this movie was really funny. So I was at my Grandfathers house and it just so happened he had it. To make it even better it was the unrated version. So I watched it and didn't get more than half of the jokes. About two years later I watched it again and laughed my f***in brains out. I was like how did I not think that this was funny the first time. There was just one thing that I thought was weird that all the characters had bad teeth. Was it set up or was it not. Oh well it was still funny as hell.<br />This is a 90's version of \\"Porkys\\", its about several guys trying to lose their virginity at the prom. They dicover different ways to plesure them selves and pleasure others. In the process they all find a date. But when all goes bad their plans backfire and they get screwed. <br />This hilarious movie depicts a very weird version of a typical teenagers life. Not for the younger ones, and if your not into really gross sexual humor or if your gay and get offended easily dont watch.
B00005B36H|5.0|I have seen tears well in the eyes of youth as they contemplate the immersive lyrics of Parabol and Parabola.  Car-fulls of teens screaming along with The Grudge.  Friends lulled to sleep by Disposition.  This album maturely and masterfully reflects every aspect of teen life today.  I gave it to my cousin when I heard he had become suicidal.  Lateralus is Gospel, plain and simple.
B0000C6E4D|4.0|The people that I hear whining about this album are either non-Sarah fans or they are continually comparing it to her other works.  No this album isn't Fumbling, but it doesn't have to be.  Pull this album out of the Sarah arsenal and you have an incredible album with amazing vocals, poignant moments, and a little bit of every era Sarah.<br />This album did take some time to sink in, but did it ever.  The beauty of Afterglow is in it's simplicity.  Songs like &quot;Time&quot;, &quot;Answer&quot;, and &quot;Perfect Girl&quot; jump out at you and grab you.  Maybe not on your first listen, but they do.  &quot;Fallen&quot; is a very strong track as are &quot;Stupid&quot; and &quot;Dirty Little Secret&quot;.  <br />This is an album of transition, one in which every Sarah we know (Touch, Solace, Fumbling, Surfacing) is present in one form or another.  This is a great album that should not be left off of any Sarah fan's CD shelf.  She is an icon, she is a goddess, and she continues to be with this album...even if it isn't outwardly apparent.
B000000WCV|5.0|THis ones for all the 21st century electro-pimps who like fat beats, dirty bass lines, first generation drum sequenceres and house music that isn't made for E'd up 14-yr olds who sport bad haircuts, parachute pants and neon jewlery or 30-something urban professionals who think that \\"house music is kinda like disco, which is cool cause i just missed out on that generation, and grew up in the 80's where I developed my incredibly poor taste in music\\" Homework is the sound track to a night of overpriced alcohol, riots in line, crusty clubs that were once abbatoires or opium dens, pointless mayhem and experimental sex. Don't be fooled, this ones for the refined music lover, who likes their bass lines low and raunchy,beats in analog form,and the hypnotic ambiance created by sampled street scenes and robo-reverberated electro men.
B000001EXR|5.0|If you're a KISS fan and go: &quot;gee that album ain't on my collection&quot; you've been missing out on an excellent material here.  You may say it ain't the original sounding KISS, but I mean it isn't the same KISS and besides who wants to be hearing the same type of music over and over?  This is a really refreshing sound for old fans and for people who only know that KISS is a bunch of guys in make-up you're in for something special.  The album starts with the song HATE, now it  must be a heavy song to have a title like that, it sets the mood and tells you that this ain't you average KISS album.  RAIN follows up and the beat's ok but Paul Stanley should have let this one to Gene to sing.  MASTER/SLAVE now! here Paul hit it right, an awsome bass line leading the tune, here's were you find yourself repeating this tune.  CHILDHOOD'S END, this can be looked as a KISS song, but the kids choir they have doing back up vocals sounds great and Gene sings it perfectly.  I WILL BE THERE, it's just perfect acustics, if KISS had done this in their early years...  THE JUNGLE a big bass groove and cool lyrics, if it had more air time to play it would've gone further.  IN MY HEAD, did somebody say kick ass song?   I CONFESS, good vibe and Gene nails this one.  SEDUCCTION OF THE INNOCENT,  cool lyrics and the whole guitars, bass and drums flow smoothly.  IT NEVER GOES AWAY, rythm is good, but personally Gene would have done it better on the mic.  I WALK ALONE, Bruce sounds good, but seems to kind of sing like Ace, but still it's a good song to finish the album.  <BR>To sum up, just give it a try if you like metal and grunge this album is a must for anybody!  If you're a KISS fan that plays it safe with albums from their 70's era at least Childhood's End, I Will Be There and I Confess will definitely grab your attention and for them non make-up KISS fans you'll receive this one really good...
B00009TB5G|5.0|Being a fan of Fellowship of the Ring I couldn't wait for this Extended edition of the Two Towers. The film is amazing I'm sure that enough people have said glowing things about this film already. I personaly feel that this DVD is one of the finest ever made. The extra's alone are mindblowing. <br />Amazing directing by Peter Jackson. I have to say that I love this title more than the first, gives me the same feeling as Empire Strikes Back did Amazing and the best of the trilogy.<BR>But it stops there because Return of the King is the Film of the Decade so far.<br />Get this DVD it will cause you to buy the other extended editions and you will never watch this film in the other format.
B000068FUS|4.0|Reviews so far are either glowing or very bad.  The later seem to involve people who bought this recording based on reputation and the fact that it's supposed to be &quot;Southern Rock.&quot;  I can see how a purchase with those expectations might lead to disappointment, particularly for those who don't really like '90's and '00's roots rock and were expecting a faithful remake of Lynard Skynard.  The band lists L.S. as an influence, but they obviously have a lot of other influences.  I hear a good bit of Rolling Stones, Neil Young, Steve Earl, Seattle grunge and more in their music.<br />Pros:  If you're a Southern person of the 30 something age range whose had any issues coming to terms with what being Southern means, both good and bad, then the theme of this album is likely to hit you between the eyes.  These guys speak with a certain honesty not often heard.  The album works on both first and repeated listenings and is one of the most REWARDING new releases to listen to in several years.  These guys are fast becoming my favorite band.<br />Cons:  A half star or so deducted due to rather primative guitar soloing (which also has its good side) and here and there a little bit of crudeness in the lyrics (I'm not talking about profanity . . . I mean the lyrics are a little unpolished in spots).  Note, both of these criticisms are mere nit-picks when the work is considered as a whole.<br />Overall, an amazing album!
B00005U8EM|5.0|First of all, let me say that I've never been a big fan of Bill Murray.  While he can be funny at times, his humor seems to be rather pretentious and unsophisticated.<br />I rented this movie one night on a lark.  To say that I was pleasantly suprised would be an understatement.  Finally, there exists a film in which Murray culls some of his comedic excesses for the purpose of making a movie that can appeal to moviegoers of all ages.<br />The plot employs a device similar to the one in &quot;It's A Wonderful Life&quot; or even &quot;A Christmas Carol.&quot;  Playing a small-city TV newscaster forever in search of a bigger and better broadcasting gig, the obnoxious, shallow, and self-absorbed Murray is sent to cover Groundhog Day in Puxatawny, Pennsylvania.  Murray is then inexplicably forced to relive the day over and over again.  At first, Murray lives in denial at his circumstances, but his shallowness quickly adapts to the situation as he tries to take advantage of his guilded cage.  He uses the carryover of knowledge and experiences gained from his reliving of Groundhog Day to rob an armored car, seduce a woman by learning all about her and then pretending to be an old forgotten friend in a 'later' Groundhog Day, and behave increasingly like an uncouthe idiot during his repeated broadcasts of Puxatawny Phil's (the name of the groundhog) appearance.  He knows that regardless of whatever offense he commits, he will emerge unscathed because the day will simply end and be repeated.<br />However, even someone as shallow as Murray's character begins to learn that his 'victories' are fleeting and ultimately unfulfilling.  This emptiness drives him to the point of madness and he eventually tries to kill himself (several times).  He actually succeeds each time, but reawakens in the same hotel bed every morning to the tune of the same Sonny and Cher song, &quot;I've Got You, Babe,&quot; on the radio.<br />Finally, Murray realizes that perhaps he would be better off putting the time to better use.  He learns to play the piano (going from beginner to an accomplished player in who knows how many Groundhog Days), reads books on philosophy, takes up ice sculpting, and actually tries to get to know and help the people in the small town around him without the intent of taking advantage of them.<br />Only then is he finally released from his prison.<br />Murray's transformation from scoundrel to all-around good guy is done very well, and there are some genuinely moving moments in the movie--such as when, despite his repeated best efforts, he fails to save the life of a homeless elderly man that he knows is destined to die.  It is in these scenes that Murray shows he does have the ability to handle an acting role that requires him to be sincere and serious in a convincing manner.<br />The supporting cast is excellent, including Andie McDowell and Chris Elliot--both of whom don't know what to make of Murray's sudden conversion (which, from their perspective, occurs in only one day).  <br />Highly recommended.  Certainly Bill Murray's best movie to date (including &quot;Caddyshack&quot; and &quot;Stripes&quot;).
0446678430|5.0|Of all the RICH DAD books this is my most favorite.  Why? Simply because we've got someone who can walk the talk, telling us that most of the resistance we experience in making money is our own limitations.    It didn't make sense when I was working a day job. Sounded like a bunch of huey, really, but, once I started down the entrepreneurial path, that all changed.    I'm in total agreement. Most of the limitations Americans experience with wealth is all in their heads.    That said, for those willing to take a deep look in themselves and who are willing to grow, this is one of the best books on the matter.    Highlights included:    (1) The most expensive advice is free advice b/c the wrong advice can destroy you.  How many times do we take advice from next door neighbors about stocks when they know nothing, or, almost nothing?  What does this have to do with mental limitations.  Plenty.  The people we associate with or want to believe can hold us back if their advice isn't accurate.  I wouldn't take advice from journalists on TV, who make less than 100k yet give advice on the stock market daily, would you?  Well, lots of people do listen to them.;    (2) The power of expanding one's reality.  How many things do we feel are not true yet are?  Wasn't their a time when we believed man could not fly and now we can fly?;    (3) Why do most of us not have a financial plan?  Why do we rely on the govt to take care of us?  Why do we choose to not have a long term plan?;    (4) Why the language we use restricts us even if we choose to believe it.  If we say CANNOT or SOMEDAY how does that make us feel?  How does it not serve us?;    (5) Setbacks and how they help us.  Most people give up when they're really close.;    (6) How to create a winning team to assist you;    (7) The velocity of money application; and    (8) all types of leverage to achieve our financial goals.    Highly advised reading.    NOTE: I think RK sometimes makes things sound easy.  While some of the concepts are simple, nothing is easy.  I did pre-foreclosures for a couple of years and that was tough work.  I made enough money to sit back and reflect and now I'm doing something I want to do: write a novel.  I don't plan to return to real estate but I do appreciate the many financial lessons. 12/20/05.
0142004235|5.0|By the time Steinbeck wrote \\"East of Eden,\\" (EOE) he had already written several American classics including \\"Of Mice and Men,\\" \\"The Grapes of Wrath,\\" and \\"Cannery Row\\" to mention only a few.  By then, he was a recognized master of the use of language.  He could and did create complex images that evoked a wide range of thoughts and emotions.  The first chapter of EOE  - where he describes the setting of the Salinas Valley - lets any doubter know that they are reading the product of a magnificent writer.<br />I have sampled a few scholarly reviews of EOE, and I was dumbfounded by the negative tone that critics have used in reference to this novel.  Their problem seems to be with the heavy-handed use of symbolism.  There are one-sided characters that can be nothing more or less than the idea that they are representing.  Cathy is probably the clearest example of this, evil and nothing but evil.  Steinbeck also portrays two sets of \\"Cain and Abel\\" brothers who act out variations of the themes of brotherly murder and being a \\"brother's keeper.\\"   So, this is an interesting and valid observation.  <br />However, the wonders of the book clearly overshadow all else.  In addition to the imagery, which is arguably unsurpassed in American writing, he has used the story of his mother's family, the Hamiltons of Salinas Valley, to serve as an historical backdrop for the story of the symbolically challenged Trasks.  He has painted a picture of his own beginnings with flair and insight while interweaving the morality tale that creates the tension and vehicle that moves the plot along.  This feat is handled seamlessly.  Each family is colorful and interesting.   Each individual is fully developed.  As a result, each page is anticipated and savored.  <br />In the end I would say that the \\"scholars\\" need to be careful.  Like all subjective evaluations, the judgement of the quality of John Steinbeck's work is relative.  Perhaps he did not surpass his greatest accomplishments with EOE.On the other hand, very few novelists have come close to the artistry that flows through this book from beginning to end.
B00008977N|1.0|I'm a huge fan, have all the CDs, DVDs, etc. blah blah blah.  BUT, this concert BARELY sounds live.  In fact, when they're not inbetween songs, it COMPLETELY doesn't sound live.  And what's with the pedestrian synching?  Watch Manu Katche's drumming to see what I mean -- the sounds he makes come a half beat AFTER you see him hit his drums.  The same problem can be seen with various mouths not matched up to the words being sung.  I've read the other reviews and I can tell you (with my musicians ears, mind you) that I don't have a sense disorder and I have a stellar TV.  After this recording, it was brought back into the studio and simply OVER-remixed, OVER-edited, and OVER-produced.  If I wasn't such a huge fan of the songs and the artist, I'd call this DVD \\"awful.\\"
B00005JKC3|4.0|I have read so many reviews from people that after watching this film &quot;don't get it&quot;. This film builds and builds to a high ending that doesn't let go.<br />I was gripping the seat watching this film I applaud Ang Lee for pushing the envelope on this film he uses many different camera angels and techniques when it all said and done.<br />Good preformances all around from Bana and Connelly. DVD exras are very nice. Worth getting. 3 million DVD's were sold of the title the first week.....thats a very large amount if it wasn't liked.<BR>With Marvel recently announcing a sequal I am sure that Connelly and Bana are going to pass on this next film of the HULK franchise. The film made 130+ million at the box office but was considered a dissapointment.
B00003CXD0|5.0|Anyone who says this movie plays off of other cross-dressing movies is seriously mistaking.  Tootsie enhanced it. With superb acting, hysterical script, and great direction Tootsie is the funniest movie ever created. The timing Dustin Hoffman has makes the whole movie worth watching over and over and over again. YOU MUST BUY THIS MOVIE!
0767836324|1.0|It gets tiresome watching movies of dysfunctional families that try to find their way to normalcy.  Our culture has lost that sweet spirit and moral sense of values we once had more of, and this movie is the quintessential product of it.  We would not show it to our children and the movie was bad enough that we just tossed it in the trash.  Even so-so movies usually wind up down on the bottom shelf.  Not this one - out in the garbage.
B00006CXSS|5.0|BAND OF BROTHERS follows the original formation of the 101st airborne during WWII.<br />If you've seen SAVING PRIVATE RYAN it's a similar style in photography, action sequence and gore.<br />That said, this is a more developed and nuanced series as it covers over ten hours relating to: training, D-Day landing, the push into France, the stop in the Netherlands, into the Fatherland, reaching the last the resistance and dealing with occupation.<br />Expect a lot of details and nuances, which means you probably will want to go through this series more than once.<br />Overall a beautiful, terrifying, moving and indelible series.  The characters are real and true, and, based on real life 101st who speak at the very end of the series.

6302098440|5.0|This is a great movie for kids.  We're strict about what we let our kids watch and this is one of the few movies that we did not have to worry about.  There is sword fighting and a castle burning (boiling oil and all) but the overall story is excellent and very entertaining.  Prince Valiant is a true good guy and true love and good prevail.  One of the best movies we have - it has all the right elements:  knights, a good plot, a love story that is virtuous, and enormous fun.  Great to go along with that Playmobil castle you buy for your kids.
B000022TSW|3.0|Some would say that South Park has always been a hit-or-miss affair.  It's always crude and irreverent, but it is also occasionally hilarious social commentary.  But it is at least as often mere trash without any redeeming value.  Could anyone seriously think that a half-hour episode of Terrance and Phillip farting was anything other than Trey and Matt's way of telling their viewers how little they thought of them?  Does anyone really think that Mr. Hankey is anything better than annoying?  If you answered either of these questions \\"yes,\\" this is the movie for you.  Check \\"yes\\" where it asks \\"was this review helpful\\" and buy this movie without delay.  And read no further.<br /><br />For the rest of us, don't bother with this movie.  With the South Park series, there are really good episodes and really bad episodes.  Mmmmkay?  The problem with the movie is that it's got both.  Mmmmkay?  It's as if they had a half an hour of good material, and then stretched out to movie length, with garbage thrown in to fill the extra time. Mmmmkay?<br /><br />Contrary to what the gushing reviews have said, the social satire isn't brilliant, it trite. The songs aren't brilliant, they're tripe.  This movie doesn't even begin to approach the quality of \\"Beavis and Butt Head Do America.\\"  It's just tedious.<br /><br />UPDATE:  It's been almost 10 years since I wrote that review, and I've reconsidered my one star review.  It's still no \\"Beavis and Butt Head Do America,\\" but some of the stuff that I found annoying the first time I watched it now seem even mildly amusing, and some of the songs have grown on me.  And compared to what they've done on the TV show since about season 13, this is pure South Park gold.
0385507755|5.0|Be prepared.  This is not your run-of-the-mill \\"Clean and Sober\\" story.  This story belts you in the face from the very beginning with the harsh, cold reality of addiction.  This very realistic, honest depiction of the depths of addiction is not a ploy to appeal to the grotesque or morbid curiosity in people, but very necessary to understand the thinking problems and the behavior manifested by these thoughts present in active addicts.  This story is one of heart-breaking saddness, despair, lonliness, abondonment and self-loathing.  It is also a story of courage, triumph of will and determination.  Frey's style is different, no doubt about it.  His halting style and repitiousness have a purpose, but you must read on for it to become appearant.  It makes one uncomfortable at first, much the same way an active addict feels most of the time.  His character development is subtle but complete.  I felt that I truly understood James and his cast of compatriots and could indentify with their feelings of failure, loss and hope.  I know a little about the life of addiction, treatment and recovery and in my opinion, this is a very accurate portrait of the \\"experience, strength and hope\\" that you would find in this setting.  I appreciate that James takes his own path to his treatment, a path not recommended nor condoned by the staff at his facility all the time, but a path that proves to be the only one he could follow.  It's not always about the 12 steps and AA for everyone.  If what your looking for is a true-to-life story of struggle and redemption, addiction and recovery, death and life, look no further, you won't be disappointed.

B00005JLSE|3.0|Frist of all I don't think musicals should hit the big screen, I gave three stars for Richard Gere, Catherine Zeta Jones, Queen Latifah and Rence Zellweger for taking the parts and doing the best they could , good Effort.But the story itself was draining and painful to watch.You may catch yourself fast forwarding this one to see the story , but i guess you have to like Musicals to follow this one , I rather watch The Sound of Music with my sister than watch this .You need to like Musicals for the third time . Enjoy if you can!
B0000AZJXQ|5.0|how can you find fault with such a wonderful cd?  those who gave this album two stars must be very musically inept as they have been listening to too much three chord garage music like jet and strokes.  this is a truly wonderful and original piece of art with such standout songs as THE NOOSE, WEAK AND POWERLESS and PET.  i have to say this album is much more rewarding than MER DE NOMS, which came across to me as just a colletion of heavy songs that had been put together as an album.  this album is different; each song seems to meld into another like pink floyd, while also each having a distinguishing feature of their own (for example the sludge of the package differs greatly from the eastern-harmonic mantra of blue, while vanishing strongly resembles an 80s goth metal song in the style of the CURE).   people have also criticized the number of filler tracks on the album, however these tracks are only used as &quot;interludes&quot; to the other tracks, they are not meant to be proper tracks, sorry to dissapoint. buy this album, it is great!!!

B000092ZYX|3.0|at first listen to this cd i have to say i was very disappointed.  the last three songs on the album were in my opinion basically unistenable and many of the songs had that &quot;been there done that&quot; kind of feel to them.  it is now four months since i have made that assumption and while it still hasn't become one of my current-favourite albums, the album does manage to create its own identity in its frantic mishmash of electronica and traditionalism.  there also several good tunes on this as well, however none rank to the previous heights of KID A and OK COMPUTER. this in my opinion is just an &quot;in between&quot; album before radiohead go onto the next step.  i also think many of the songs are also marred by radiohead's insistence on being adventurous and different, such as &quot;where i end and you begin&quot;; i heard a demo of this on a charity cd and it sounded much better as the cd version feels very underdeveloped and meandering.  2+2=5 and Sail to the Moon are my two favourite tracks from this cd.

0385504209|5.0|With a thrilling and enticing plot, Brown gives a very real topic an exciting scenerio. Does the Catholic Church really take lives in this Grail Quest? Maybe. They have in the past. But that's not even the important part. Not only will this book keep your imagination running but you will also discover the etymology of words like \\"horny\\". If you think about it, what do \\"horn's\\" and sex have in common anyway? Well here ya go. This book lets you know that it is very possible that the grail isn't anything like what Indiana found as well as other useful information you can pretend to be smart and tell your friends about. However I did find myself suddenly questioning my own religion, being christian, wondering why I wear a crucifix around my neck and not an equal armed cross...so when reading, keep an open mind.
0321127420|5.0|I normally don't bother to write reviews, but some of the shallow ones I found here irritated me enough to write. I have been a developer, architect, and development manager. My latest project was a 100+ developer year enterprise application. Fowler clearly knows the field, he speaks with confidence of development experiences with projects that went live. I have no idea of what a newbie to enterprise application development would gain from this book. The DTO pattern, for example, is profoundly powerful and his representation of it is accurate, but he presents it in a casual, low-key way, and its significance might well escape the uninitiated. When you talk to programmers who only know the one thing they worked on you hear a naive, blind conviction in their voice, but when you read Fowler, you hear the weary lessons of hundreds of developers on dozens of large projects. If you are experienced, read chapter 8 first, then the patterns, then 1 - 7 if need be. If you are new, read chapter 8 first, then the patterns, then CODE the patterns a dozen times, then read the rest of the book. Fowler says you should read 1-8 then the patterns as needed, but I say the 8 pages of chapter 8 roll up the first seven chapters very nicely, and then please read all the patterns in associative order from your point of view.
B0000DD7LB|5.0|Someone here wrote that many reviews are written based on whether they like the artist or not and that is not what people want.<BR> I'd like to say that it does matter whether people like the artist or not. Because if the person reading the review is a fan of the artist, they will sort of make out whether they ought to buy the CD or not. Escpecially a CD like IN THE ZONE, where Britney seems to be leaving millions of old fans behind and gained a lot of fans who were not her fans before. <BR>So I do think it is fine to mention whether they like the artist or not.<BR>Now about the CD, here's a rating of each song - <BR>MATM - 4.5/5<BR>Boom Boom - 4/5<BR>Showdown - 5/5<BR>Breathe on me - 4.5/5<BR>Early morning - 1.5/5<BR>Toxic - 5/5<BR>Outrageous - 5/5<BR>Touch of my hand - 5/5<BR>The hook up - 5/5<BR>Shadow - 6/5 (Ballad)<BR>Brave new girl - 5/5<BR>Everytime - 7/5<BR>MATM RRDKmix - 5/5<BR>The CD gets better in the later half. I do hope Britney's next album has more ballads. I'm a bit disappointed with the CD, being an old fan of hers. I think old fans will like the CD but not as much as the first three albums. Hiphop and R&amp;B fans are sure to find something they'll like in this CD. <BR>I don't know whether you should buy it. It depends a lot on the listener. If you're an old fan, you should buy it because of songs like Toxic, Shadow, Brave new girl and Everytime. If you're an R&amp;B/hiphop fan, you should buy it for songs like Boom boom, showdown, Early mornin, Outrageous. Touch of my hand, me against the music and Breathe on me are songs that anybody can listen to. If you can't stand Britney, do not buy it because her voice will irritate you to your grave. <BR>I hope you found this review useful..
0920668372|5.0|this is a children's book. hello, it was written for the benefit of someone that thinks mac and cheese is a gourmet dinner. it was not written for thirtysomething wanna- be psychologists. yes, if i were to hear that some guy i know's mom was crawling in through his window to tell him she loves him, i would think it a bit odd. however, to a small child, hearing that your parent's will love you forever and always, even when you're all grown up, is a comfort. children aren't going to read this and think, \\"man, have these people got issues!\\"  ask a little boy who he's going to marry when he grows up and a very large percent will answer, \\"my mom!\\"  do you really think that all these little boys are harboring oedipal urges for their mothers? give me a break. to a child, love is love. that's all, that's it. mom tells him that she loves him when he's happy, he's sad, naughty, even when he's a dad. honestly, put away your psych 101 texts and realize that even if you don't get it, you're child does.
B000002UAX|4.0|There are alot of complaints about the filler on this album and that none of the songs are the strongest. But I feel that is not what the Beatles wanted, they weren't concerned with what would make up the strongest album, this was about seeing them for what they were. And I believe you can hear it in the album, you hear each song that the Beatles write reflecting the particular writer's personality. You can hear John's Meaningful lyrics and rockin music but see that he isn't afraid to pick up an acoustic and keep it real simple. You can hear Paul's wonderful music arrangements with somewhat silly lyrics (sadly a divider of Lennon/McCartney)but also that he can still do some good old rock music. You can hear George's social/religious messages in his songs plus with the best track on the album in While My Guitar Gently Weeps his emerging as the dark horse. You even get a glimpse of Ringo in his one song writing effort. <BR>Some little jokes are on here to, like the rockin song Back In The USSR made to make fun of the Beach Boys and Chuck Berry's songs Back in the US. Glass Onion to ease the pain of critics trying to figure out songs on their last releases. And Goodnight which was originally written by John to be a simple bedtime song for his son just played on guitar, but he thought to make fun of Disney and just go overboard with orcastral arrangement (which I personally think is quite funny after growing up with the old Disney stuff).  <br />All in all I gave it four stars because some of the songs could have been left off like Paul granny song Honey Pie and the weirdest effort ever by John Revolution #9. And as for filler songs there is always some people that like them better than all the ones that everybody else seemingly likes, and there are like possibly 4 albums on the planet that don't have any filler so I never saw the issue with that anyway.
B0000X61VE|5.0|I've tried numerous video's and dvd's while exercising at home and this is the first one that I actually enjoyed doing. Cindy and her trainer Radu talk like normal people during the workout and not like a lot of others who make you want to turn the sound off. <br />The workout itself is very good and you will notice a difference in your shape if you stick with it. Some of the moves are done too fast but you can slow your own moves down without having to stop the dvd. <br />Cindy's second dvd called &quot;The Next Challenge&quot; is just as good as this one but it's a lot tougher. Start with &quot;Shape Your Body&quot; if your a beginner and work your way up to &quot;The Next Challenge&quot;. If you try these and stick with them, you won't be disappointed.
B0000C7PSW|1.0|On his first album he was a young avant-garde prodigy with endless possibilities.  On his second (and by far, best) album, he realized some of the possibilities weren't endless, but he still maintained a wink over his glare of grim acceptance.  On this album, he fails musically for the first time, and stumbles over lyrics so trite and just plain bad (and I quote, \\"You walk alone in the valley of life, In the shadow of love under the trees of happiness\\") that one wishes he'd go back on drugs.  Seems for some, writing about what you hope life will be like works out better than writing what your life actually is.  Poses is one of my favourite albums ever, this is only one of the albums i've most been dissapointed by in my life.  Let's hope Want Two goes back to the days when Rufis was indulging himself physically, not musically.  Otherwise, i'll never 'want to' hear another word uttered from his mouth.
B00000G3Q4|5.0|First of all this is probably the most important movie a film student could watch. Secondly this is a cult horror classic. Thirdly this is a genre defining film. Forth on the list is that the DVD commentary is absolutely fantastic. If you can get around to reading \\"If Chins Could Kill\\" by Bruce Campbell, who plays the protagonist, Ash, in this film then you will also learn a lot more about it and will be happy that you did.<br />Sam Raimi (Director of Spider-Man) made the Evil Dead with his friends when he was just little more than a teenager. He made a short film called (Within In The Woods) which you can find using P2P sharing programs. It is only available in bootleg format and has only been released on the Laser Disc version of this film. It was also released on a special DVD package but was revoked because of distribution copyright problems. Sam Raimi took that Super 8mm film around to dentists and rich people in his area to get enough money together to make a feature film called \\"The Book of the Dead\\". The distributors changed the title because they felt that people did not want to \\"read\\" a film.<br />The Evil Dead is low budget through and through but you must give it credit for the sheer creative energy that is on display. The story is also not bad. What makes this film stand out is the special effects. Although they are hammy, they are also excellently done for what is effectively a student film. The last scene features some really insane stop-motion effects. The camerawork is also a way above average. Raimi tilts the camera, bends the lens, flies the camera through a forest and even manages to hover it above the rafters. This is all daring and bold filmmaking coming from people who had nothing. Effectively this is the benchmark for all students attempting to make a horror feature film which is a good point of entry for them.<br />The film has not been banned for twenty years in the US but had been banned in the UK and then severely cut when it got its release. The MPAA refused a certificate in the US. It is only recently that it managed to acquire the NC-17 rating. The censors apparently laughed their way through it. They loved it, but it does have some very brutal scenes, one of them is sexual and involves a tree, and certainly it was released at the wrong time when video nasty opposition groups where very active. The truth be told the Evil Dead is a film that did a way better on video than it did on the cinema screen. It was the advent of household VCR systems that jettisoned the Evil Dead into the limelight.<br />The premise is simple. Five youths go to a log cabin in the woods to have a good time but manage to awaken the undead. Cue lots of scares, action, gore and amazing camera work.<br />This is a first rate horror movie with plenty of suspense to boot. It is marred by low production values and a list of relatively unknown actors for their time but who cares? This is all great fun from start to finish and well worthy of its cult status and fanboy appeal. Fans watch this at least once a week. Can't say I blame them either. It is a gem of a great fun film. Perfect for viewing at parties. It always gets a laugh.
B00005JM4Z|1.0|The Dialogue in this movie is so cheesy that it made Swat look like a masterpeice. I think that is was written by some kid that dropped english before the 6th grade. The acting was, \\"Oh Look We're Two Good Looking Guys Racing Around In Hot Cars, Lets Wear Tight Clothes\\" sadly I think this was also the story line. <br />This is nothing more than the studio trying to tap into pop culture and rob (and I do mean rob) the kids (watching this mindless drivel) of the nation out of their parent's money.
B000022TSW|5.0|What I found interesting about the movie was how we were shown that it's not Satan we have to worry about taking over the world- it's extreme, narrow minded knee-jerk reacting people (unfortunately those who seem to have the most power, or at least the loudest voices) who will be our undoing. South Park is some of the best satire I've ever seen, bar none. People who can't get past the profanity and farts to hear the show's message aren't worth my time and energy. They can go back to their Seinfeld and Friends and live on in blissful ignorance. Parker and Stone are the big middle finger to these people. Bravo! Long live the 1st Ammendment.
076790592X|5.0|In &quot;Tuesdays with Morrie&quot; one expression sums up the story...when you learn how to die, you learn how to live. During each session with Morrie, the author grows as he discovers more and more about the person he truly is. While he is on his journey to self-discovery, the reader is also whisked off on their own journey of self-exploration. Many times throughout the book I paused and reflected on the wise words of Morrie. I was initially drawn to his honest and direct stance on many issues including: death, fear, aging, marriage, greed, society, familty,forgiveness, and a what it means to have a fulfilling life.
B0000640SA|5.0|Here we have a man whoe had an accident.  He can no longer make new memories, they just fade away.  So he must leave himself notes.  Mostly in the form of poloroid picture and very important notes are tattooed to his body.  He is on a mission of revenge.  He is after his wife's rapist and murderer.  But he has no memory after the accident.  <br />The movie begins with the end and goes to the beginning in ten to fifteen minute segments divided always by a black and white segment that goes in normal order which actually takes place before the colour part does.  It may sound confusing, but is actually quite e4asy to follow.  The point of the movie is not to find out whodunit, but the why.<br />The acting is perfect and the cinematogrophy is perfect as well.  The music really fits the mood too.  Plus there is a twist at the end (or the beginning!).  Multiple viewings are required to really pick up on certain things that are definelty missed and will make the story have more sense and really uncover the &quot;conspiracy&quot;, if there really is one that is!<br />The special features could be really good...if I could find them that is.  Disc 2 is filled with them.  But the menus and the &quot;tests&quot; you have to take on each selection are so cryptic and obscure its darn near impossible.  It took me an hour to get the &quot;anatomy of a scene&quot; show thing.  And that was all I was able to find.  That one gripe aside, everything is perfect.  I have no beef with the movie whatsoever, it's totally awesome and I wish everyone would watch it.  Watch it!
B00005JMCW|5.0|This movie is incredible; they way both characters can play each other so convincingly makes it a great movie.  The circumstances in which the plot takes place... a wedding and a concert makes it too much more fun.  And Jack going crazy for Jaime Lee Curtis was a perfect touch.  I give this movie a 2 thumbs up.
B0000DJZA5|4.0|Over 600 reviews already. As a Beatles fan for over 20 years I must say that I really like this album. I rate it 4 stars as it could have been better. The sound quality is 5 stars, absolutely brilliant. Is is about time all Beatles cd's were remastered. The song Get Back is too short however, something is missing. The Long and winding Road is wonderful, much better as the original version and different from other versions known to me thru bootlegs and anthology. Don't let me down is well worth buying the whole album for. An excellent version, beautifully sung. <br />The album is too short however. To make it something really special they should have included much more. The whole rooftop concert for instance and so many other versions of the songs are available. The title of the album and the cover are horrible. Why not use the picture made for the originally planned \\"Get Back with Let it be and 11 other songs\\" album?
B000002UDB|4.0|this is probably the weaksest beatles album next to let it be. although it has some awesome tunes such as the title song baby your a rich man and of course the greatest beatle song ever I am the walrus. Now i am a very big Beatles fan but anyone who gives this 5 stars really should get some more music. Because this cd also has alot of horrible trash such as Hello goodbye, penny lane and flying. so the bottom line is if ur a huge beatles fan buy it if u love I am the walrus buy it if not skip this one and get the white Album or Sgt. pepper. or if u want just buy a greates hits.
B00005QW4K|5.0|This movie takes place after the last one with Ash attempting to send the evil back in time, but a portal opens up and Ash is sent, car, shotgun, chainsaw, and all back to the 13th century.  He is then captured by Arthur's clan, his his believed to be in league with Henry's clan (two waring groups).  After a heroic escape from the well, Ash shows those &quot;primitive screwheads&quot;<BR>what's up with his shotgun (and a hilarious quote!).<br />Eventually Ash is sent on a quest to find the Necromonicon.  This book, while keeping the Deadites away forever, will also send Ash home.  Ash ventures out, and encounters some great scenes (bad ash, and the mini ash's).  He eventually finds the book, but screws up a vital part of taking it and unleashes the deadites.  Ash then brings Arthur and Henry together and they fight the deadites using modern science (provided by ash) and wonderful low budget goodness!<br />This movie, one of the most popular horror-comedies out there is also one of the most quoteable.  There are classics throughout the whole movie that everyone will love!  The special features are decent.  There's a couple of commentaries and some deleted scenes as well as story boards.  All good here!<br />Do yourself a favour and pick this classic up!  No longer a cult classic, but a real classic.
B000062X9B|5.0|My favorite song of all time is Would You Lay With Me In A Field Of Stone and to hear Johnny Cash sing it is lovely. Tanya Tucker recorded it and so did David Allan Coe who wrote it, but Johnny sings it well too and it's so moving. This is a fine record and I also love it when Johnny sings about the Lord. They don't play Johnny Cash, Hank Williams, Dolly Parton, David Allan Coe, and Merle Haggard and the other country legends much, but I can play this over and over and my grandchildren love it. Rest In Peace Johnny Cash.
0671027387|5.0|I have a friend who once thought that Clive Cussler represented the pinnacle of action-adventure authors.  In short:  Dan Brown's _Deception Point_ is a story that Cussler wishes he could write.  Bringing NASA, governmental affairs, oceanic exploration, and Delta Force into a single, coherent story isn't easy - but Brown deftly weaves together fantastically engaging plotlines into a great overall story.<br />Rachel Sexton is an employee of the NRO, a little-known governmental agency, who is responsible for briefing the President on recent discoveries.  Because of his trust in her, the President appoints Rachel to a team of independent experts brought to the Arctic wilderness to validate a NASA discovery.  Its Polar Explorer satellite has discovered a large meteorite buried in the ice.  Inside the meteorite is an astounding find:  fossilized creatures of the sort never seen before on Earth.<br />The ramifications of this find are truly staggering: the Presidential election hangs in the balance and the discovery can swing support for the incumbent because of his long-standing support for NASA.  But when Rachel and her team discover evidence of fraud, all hell breaks loose.<br />Action, science, adventure, exploration: Brown has done a great job - much, much improved over previous work like _Digital Fortress_.  If you want a great escapist, adventure story - look no further.
B00006CXXU|1.0|this cd is very boring. Stripped does show how good of a singer she is but all her songs are stupid and pointless. Dirrty is a good dance song but trash the video. that was a publicity stunt to show that christina has to fight for her trophy over britney. I will give her credit for some songs. Fighter is a great song, and Unfactuation. But if you want something more that christina singing about her problems. get another one
0142000663|5.0|Nestled between the parched earth of the Oklahoma country and the flooded fields of the California valley lies a tale so stark that its own nakedness adorns it like the most precious jewel. The story is narrated in the rustic tongues of the Joad family and the poetic maelstrom of the author's conscience; the guileless, earthy wisdom of country folks and the refined, high-flying ideology of Steinbeck. I don't recall being more moved by any other piece of literature ever.<br />The younger Tom Joad is easily one of the finest characters I've read. There is no magic attributed to Tom or his family and the author does not ask you to suspend reality anywhere in the novel. If anything, the reality is so overwhelming that I often found myself breaking in-between and taking a few minutes off to unwind.<br />The book is written with excruciatingly detailed observations like \\"Joad took the bottle from him (Casy, the preacher), and in politeness did not wipe the neck with his sleeve before he drank\\"! To write something like that, a person would have to have powers of perception that transcend sight or sound. We've read so many times of vague emotions; unidentifiable joys, unnamed pains, inexplicable kinship and intuitive distrust. With Steinbeck, there is no ambiguity. It is, as is.<br />Every alternating chapter details the journey of the Joads while the ones in between are the author's discourse on the larger issue of human depravity of which the sufferings of the Joad family are but the most nominal instance. My favourite such chapter in the entire novel was Chapter 25. To quote, \\"The Spring is beautiful in California. Valleys in which the fruit blossoms are fragrant pink and white waters in a shallow sea. Then the first tendrils of the grapes, swelling from the old, gnarled vines, cascade down to cover the trunks. The full green hills are round and soft as breasts\\"...<br />The author proceeds to describe in the most tender and in the most fascinated of terms, the luscious growth of fruits and vegetables and flowers and the men who work to create this marvel of plenty. He sings paeans to their ingenuity and slowly trundles through to the ripening and maturing of this plentiful produce and suddenly we find ourselves facing the most abhorrent of truths. In the face of exploitation and refusal to pay the wages for this harvest to be reaped, Steinbeck wreaks his vengeance on this paradisical beauty so elegantly painted in his lyrical prose. He commands the birds and the wasps and the flies to feast on the decaying, stinking, putrefying apparition left in the aftermath of his destructive force. His weapon, his mighty pen. Truly, no sword could obliterate with such completeness.<br />\\"Men who can graft the trees and make the seeds fertile and big can find no way to let the hungry people eat their produce. Men who have created new fruits in the world cannot create a system whereby their fruits may be eaten. And the failure hangs over the State like a great sorrow.\\"<br />Steinbeck has had his revenge. It does little to comfort him.<br />\\"There is a crime here that goes beyond denunciation. There is a sorrow here that weeping cannot symbolize. There is a failure here that topples all our success.\\"<br />I shook when I was done reading this chapter. I am no Communist, not even quite a Socialist. But this book is one of the finest examples of how high the human mind can fly, how far and wide it can see, how unflinchingly it can comprehend and how  limitlessly it can feel. I consider myself most fortunate to have read this book. Read it.rowth of fruits and vegetables and flowers and the men who work to create this marvel of plenty.

0064471837|5.0|When I first saw this book in my school library, when I was 12...<br />I blew it off.<br />Sure, it looked cool. The cover art is amazing, but the summary seemed too typical. Finally, though, I gave in. I checked it out, totally skeptical.<br />4 pages, and I was hooked. My mother yelled at me for trying to read it during dinner.<br />Now 15, I've read it over again, and I **still** go back to my favorite parts.<br />The main character is a strong, yet serious teenage girl named Sabriel. Normally, I hate that sort of character, but she was great. The characters are all amazing and VERY well thought out. Sabriel is the heir to the title of Abhorsen. An Abhorsen is a necromancer (thats a person who can raise/control the dead) of sorts, a holy one. Their job is \\"to bind and destroy\\" any 'problematic' spirits or necromancers. One night in her school, Sabriel recives word from her father that he is indeed trapped in death, a second dimension of sorts. Setting out to find his body and free him, Sabriel soon discovers there are darker things brewing. She meets up with Mogget, an all-powerful spirit...<br />stuck in the form of a cat. Definetely my favorite character. There is also Touchstone, a berserker prince who was sealed as a wooden figurehead. With these strange companions, the young woman travels in the Old Kingdom, fighting the dead and unraveling the tangled strings that are all tied to her fate.<br />There is also a sense of modernism. There is Ancelstierre, the New Kingdom, which is like a modern-day city. Then there is the Old Kingdom, an almost empty area where the dead don't tend to stay dead.<br />There is so much in this that is so original. The above wall,death being represented as \\"gates\\" (there being 9 in all), her weapons being bells...it's fantastic.<br />Buy this. You will not regret this.<br />If you're like me, you like happy endings and lighthearted books. While this is pretty heavy sometimes, it's so good you won't give a flying crap.<br />This book made me laugh, it made me cry, and it **SCARED** the heck out of me. Seriously!<br />Most likely one of the GREATEST fantasy novels I have ever read.<br />Also, read Lirael and Abhorsen, which are the sequels! They're JUST as good!!!!book made me laugh, it made me cry, and it **SCARED** the heck out of me. Seriously!<br />Most likely one of the GREATEST fantasy novels I have ever read. <br />Also, read Lirael and Abhorsen, which are the sequels! They're JUST as good!!!!
B000092ZYX|5.0|My only problem with this album is that it barely rocks at all, and is a little depressing (2+2=5 being the exception).  Its definitely the best album released since the 90's ended so far.  There are so many amazing songs on this album, but the highlights would have to be \\"2+2=5\\", \\"I Will\\", and \\"A Wolf at the Door\\".
B0000DD7LB|5.0|This is definitly another great album by Miss Spears. All tracks are worth listening too. The stand out tracks are Boom Boom, Toxic,Outragous,Touch of my hand, Hook up, and Everything. She is now finally grown up and can sing what she wants. Some are comparing her to miss christinia. yes she does have a better voice but all her songs are boring ballads.I think christnia needs to work a bit more to catch up to britneys record sales. Although i have always liked britney better for whatever she does. christina is just gross. Anyway the album is great and worth listening too.
0385507755|5.0|I would like to thank James Frey for writing a heart-wrenching, passionate, revealing, courageous tale for us. He takes great risks and ultimately wins us over with his naked prose. At the risk of sounding cliche, I was literally unable to wedge my bookmark between the golden pages. I cared so deeply for the \\"hero\\" in his tome, and that's what he is - a hero. Mr. Frey's grizzly descriptions of the lead character's struggles captivate the reader from page one. Just when you think this character has braved his darkest demons, it gets more and more dismal; however, through black moments like receiving a root canal with no pain management, there is somehow this ever-present light that carries him (and us) through.<br />I must read it again.
B0000AQVCL|5.0|This is the best of the new rock/retro scene. Its just simply fantastic, they are already on tour with the Stones for a reason! All those other &quot;the&quot; bands are great but they dont have anything on the raw primal energy of this record, the magazine ravings are just b/c this is awesome!!!
B000002TQV|5.0|if only radiohead would keep rocking like this.  i know it would never happen, because thom just HAS to be as weird as possible, but i suppose I should be grateful that the band has released so much damn fine music.  \\"Just\\" is probably the most rockin' song ever.
B0000797IO|4.0|The characters are so unusual and eccentric and different that they are real.  It's a strange thing when a movie like this comes along and destroys my preconceptions.  I was certain I was in store for another romantic comedy starring Jennifer Aniston with a touch of quirkiness to make it endearing.  How many films does that sound like?  But all the characters in this screenplay are rich with texture; and all actors here with a speaking part are memorable.  Not necessarily because of what they do so much as who they are.  The depth of this movie is so subtle that it will probably be missed by most people.  All the actors here play their characters to the hilt.  From the Goth-chic check-out girl to the Bible-thumping security guard, they all enter your mind and linger.  John C. Reilly, the most reliable supporting actor in the business, is excellent as the sturdy but flawed husband.  Jake Gyllenhaal, of &quot;Donnie Darko&quot; cult fame, is mesmerizing as the &quot;demon&quot; in Jennifer Aniston's life.  But the jewel in this film is Jennifer Aniston, with her touching performance that comes across real and surreal, emotional and confused, subject to fantasy but grounded.  Her character is so attractive in so many ways.  This is the first time I was impressed with her acting ability.  I think I'm in love.  Is she married?  Oh,yeah..to that Brad-guy, right?  Dang!
630529142X|1.0|Oh!, here's a shocker!, another stupidly unfunny movie made by adam Sandler!, and he's using that dorky baby voice again. The funniest thing about adam sandler is that the baby voice is actually his &quot;real voice&quot; which you hear during his off camera interviews which are few and far between because his grammer and sentence structure in real life also sounds like a fourth grader at best. I cant believe anyone could be entertained by this guy. His movies and most of his SNL material are for the extremely simple minded (i'm talking five year olds here).
0385504209|5.0|The book was an exellent read, and I can't wait for the movie
B000002UJQ|5.0|Every modern rock band, good or bad, looks up to radiohead.  Coldplay's Chris Martin has been seen at Radiohead shoes.  Something Corporate covered them.  Why?  Because they are the best at what they do, and this album changed the face of rock.  If the band had released this album with just paranoid android on it, I would still give it 5 stars.
0385504209|1.0|I haven't read a book this bad in a long time. The writing was poor, the topic was sensationalistic, the characters were stilted and often unrealistic, and the \\"revelations\\" the author makes about the artwork were not all that revealing. I had to force myself to read it and when I was done I actually threw it away I hated it so much. I'm relieved to know other people didn't like it either. I thought I was the only one in the country who wasn't in love with it.

B00005R2IS|4.0|It is a great movie. Just about the best of it's kind ever mind. Has bravura performances (yeah Gibson's great acting in it but how about some kudos for the nice looking chick playing his wife in this movie----Joanne Samuel), believable futuristic sets, plenty of action, magnificent score, memorable dialogue. It tries hard to be more than just a movie and it suceeds admirably. But now two problems with this honestly magnificent film (maybe minor problems---maybe!). One. The film looks it's made mostly for 15 year olds. I swear. It'a alot of action and emotion (too much at times) and some more story woulda really been nice in parts. Learning more about, say, Max and Jesse's marriage. Also, how civilization fell. Two. The story itelf is uneven. After the gangmember, The Knight Rider, is killed while Max (Gibson) is pursuing he (Max) is told the man's gang is out to get him. Ok. So when Max later meets up with all of them hoods it's because the gang is after him for killing the Knight Rider, right? Wrong! It's Max that is after them for incidentally (to the KnightRider's cause) killing Max's child and wife, both of whom the gang coincidentally met up with while the family of Max (and Max too) were faraway on a vacation! What happened to the gang's original plan to get Max for killing their leader? And talk about your chance meetings and it's a small world after all. These and other uneven bits (some concerning characters, like a hood called Johnny the boy) abound. Like I said story is uneven.
0790742780|5.0|The first time I saw this film, I didn't like it... yet for some bizarre reason I felt compelled to come back to the theatre and watch it again... and again... and again...<br />The film is particularly interesting because it plays on a common human fantasy :  The wimpish underdog suddenly becoming empowered and turning the tables on his enemies in a very Hollywoodish manner...  Though many films may have unlikely superheroes, the film plays upon this fantasty to a most ridiculous extreme and the realism inherent in the plot (he's not a superhero in blue tights) is what makes the film so unique... I mean, its one thing to punch out some guy you don't like...  but to gradually acquire an evergrowing and more powerful arsenol of weapons along the way and use them to confront every single menace of daily urban living  ?  - - Oddly enough, though no idealistic Billy Jack (see \\"The Born Losers\\") Douglas's cartoonish laid off white male pencil pusher turned madman vigilante easily strikes a chord in the viewer... Yes, the guy is obviously off his rocker... but you can't help chuckling at him as he confronts one social ***hole stereotype after another... You watch the film - - understand that he's obvoiusly the bad guy, yet can't help cheer him on as he confronts everyone from gangsters to cheeky fast food convenience store workers (one who looks amazingly like one of the Brady's) ... and of course a paranoid homophobic neo-nazi Army/Navy Surplus Store owner.  - - One downside of the film however is that at times it seems to try so hard to make its point.... My favorite is the \\"poignant\\" shot of the American flags falling to the ground in slow motion as Douglas \\"turns back prices to 1955\\" and teaches the Korean store owner a lesson about living in \\"his\\" country ! - - and also the various \\"montage\\" type sequences the director uses to demonstrate urban angst with the eerie incidental music... or even the \\"not economically viable\\" viable guy sequence and the shots of Douglas's character sadly watching him as he's arrested and how suddenly (...oh so dramatically) as the cop car stops he turns to him and says, \\"Don't forget me !\\" (cue the violins !) - - but the biggest example of the director's possibly intentional use of \\"over-dramatization\\" has to be the about to retire cop on his last day of work meaning from the start of the film you wonder when he's gonna it, and the director milks this to the utmost in virtually every line of dialogue whenever Duvall's character appears.  - -With all this said, in the end, FALLING DOWN wins back every point in being a great film about urban angst and frustration, even \\"white rage\\" (though you don't have to be white to associate with many of Douglas's frustrations) and a film that bears repeated watching... all in all, I would say that by any standard, be it a message, action or \\"exploitation\\" film, this is a highly watchable and re-watchable film, so you'd be at a miss not to own a copy of it !character sadly watching him as he's arrested and how suddenly (...oh so dramatically) as the cop car stops he turns to him and says, \\"Don't forget me !\\" (cue the violins !) - - but the biggest example of the director's possibly intentional use of \\"over-dramatization\\" has to be the about to retire cop on his last day of work meaning from the start of the film you wonder when he's gonna it, and the director milks this to the utmost in virtually every line of dialogue whenever Duvall's character appears.  - -With all this said, in the end, FALLING DOWN wins back every point in being a great film about urban angst and frustration, even \\"white rage\\" (though you don't have to be white to associate with many of Douglas's frustrations) and a film that bears repeated watching... all in all, I would say that by any standard, be it a message, action or \\"exploitation\\" film, this is a highly watchable and re-watchable film, so you'd be at a miss not to own a copy of it !
B0000C6E4D|4.0|I bought this CD the day it was released and it took about three or four times of listening to it before I loved it. It really takes time to let the lyrics and style sink in. It is a bit different from Fumbling, but a great album nonetheless. Fallen is a great radio single, but there are other songs that are better on this album, such as \\"Dirty Little Secret\\", \\"Stupid\\" and \\"Perfect Girl.\\"<BR>The lyrics are not as moody and dark as her last few cd's, but that is because Sara has evolved as a person, and frankly so haven't we all. I really like this CD although it is not my favorite CD of hers. It is worth the money.
B0000DJZA5|5.0|Well, I just read a review of this CD on this site. The reviewer didn't even mention the album! Instead, he just put down Sir Paul becuase of this music. <br />I think the \\"Paul\\" verson of the Let It Be album is better then the \\"Spector\\" one. People bash Paul McCartney for putting this out. Well, McCartney was a Beatle, and Spector wasn't, so I think McCartney's version is better and lives up to the \\"this is the way it was ment to be,\\" because this was how it was ment to be. Get what I'm saying?
B00005O5CM|5.0|At a time when I thought I would never genuinely laugh again, this movie brought me laughter. Elle Woods is an incredible heroine, who overcomes stereotypes to give a fresh, funny, and moving piece of entertainment.
B0000VCZKM|5.0|You can never go wrong with any Annie movie.  This is an awesome DVD and has some very cool special features.  Not your typical blah re-release of the same old movie.  This DVD is worth every penny!
B0000DZTIW|5.0|A great soundtrack all around. I'd say it's the best Zimmer score since Gladiator. It has action thrills, drama, and descriptively exotic music. If you like this mix of Asian and Western music in Zimmer fashion, I'd say this would be a good buy. I wish I could hear more albums like this from Zimmer. Anyways, props to the man!
B000089RVX|3.0|2 songs. Bring me to life &amp; going under were great. but rest of them aren't good as I had expected. all songs are too similar even more than 'NIckelback'. I wish I bought Just single CDs.<BR>and in 2003, CNN's 'The Music Room' chose this as 1st CD of the year, and I still can't understand why they did it. I think 'Meteora' is a lot better.
B000001FS3|1.0|Believe you me, I know music so I don't want to get a lot of angry &quot;you're an idiot&quot; responses.  I don't get it.  When I say &quot;it,&quot; I mean this fascination with U2.  I've listened to the Joshua Tree since I was just a kid and even as a child I could tell the band was terrible.  The Edge is an overrated guitarist and Bono's sappy lyrics and complaining voice are nore than I can handle.  U2=most overrated band in history.  I hear they are good live performers but I don't care because the music is ludicrous.  Pick up something from the Velvet Underground, early Bowie, or the Band if you want some truly compelling rock music.
B000089RVR|5.0|I loved her first album and played it non-stop for months.  I was skeptical about her second album and delayed buying it.  It is the only CD I have been listening to for the past 4 months!  Dido has strong lyrics and the music ranges from folk acoustic to upbeat techno.  This album has everything and it's an awesome sing-a-long for in the car.  Buy this album and you won't be disappointed.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I just finished watching the last DVD of this set with a great deal of sadness.  I wanted more.  Watching the special features, listening to the people who made it talk about their experiences and sadness at it's cancellation, made me realize just how and why it captured my attention so quickly.  The people on the show and behind the scenes loved making it.  There was a level of committment by them that was sadly not matched by the people they trusted to air the show.  I really hope that there can be some closure for them and for the fans in the form of a movie or mini series.<br />As for the DVD set itself, it was very well done.  I particularly like the slim cases for the DVDs.  The menus are easily navigated, there isn't too much lag time between starting the DVD and getting to the episode guides.  If you want to watch the intro you can, but it is also easy to skip past it quickly and get back to the episode.  Watching the episodes in the correct order, rather than the chaotic pattern chosen by the network, was very satisfying.  I sometimes wonder, if the network hadn't interfered with how the show was aired, would it have done better?  Why didn't they just trust the storytellers?<BR>  <BR>If you are new to the series and not sure whether to give it a try because the premise seems strange, the cost for the set is so low compared to other series that you should take a chance.  If you were a fan of the show while it aired, you have to get this set so you can see the unaired episodes.  The acting is fantastic, and the series has plenty of suprises and a few mysteries.  The characters are very believable, and you come to care about them very quickly.  How many shows have you watched where you care very little about the characters because they don't \\"speak\\" to you in some way?  Not so in this show.  These people loved making this show, and that's what makes it special and so good.  It has all of the classic Joss Whedon elements and fun interplay between characters that made Buffy so much fun to watch.  Don't be put off by the mixing of genres, but embrace it as a mechanism for providing the show with a fresh feel and unique character.  This is not cookie cutter Sci Fi.
0156027321|5.0|I absolutely loved this book. It was an intense adventure all at once beautiful and hideous, desperate and ecstatic. The vivid<BR>descriptions throughout painted a picture as beautiful and as grotesque as a dying Dorado. I highly recommend it if you want to take<BR>an emotional journey as vast as the Pacific. One thing not delivered however, it won't definitively make you a believer in God if<BR>you don't already. But you will be getting a story you will want to read more than once.
B00005JMGL|5.0|Peter Pan is the best movie I have seen in my whole life. It has everything adventure, romance, really good special effects and really good actors. When you see this movie, you travel to a whole new world, a magical world, and you escape from everything. Jeremy sumpter (peter pan) did an incredible job, I can't see another person being peter pan, directors did a great great job with him, so as with Jason Isaacs (Captain hook)and the whole cast. The chemistry between Jeremy sumpter and Rachel (wendy)it's awesome. If you like adventure or romance or fantasy, you have it all in this movie. You have to see it, you will love it, I promise.
B0000BYM3K|5.0|I've been a Maiden fan since I was a teenager--starting with Number of the Beast and then all the rest.  Somewhere around Seventh Son I stopped following them, as the cheese factor starting getting a little too high for me (especially after Bruce left).  However, I connected again with Brave New World and my passion for the band reignited.  With Brave New World, and now Dance of Death, I feel that the band has matured and evolved while not leaving their metal roots behind.  These days there is a limited selection of non-cheesy, non-growling, intelligent metal available to the adult listener. Dance of Death truely is a metal CD for grown-ups.
B000069AUI|5.0|this is the best i've heard of Coldplay so far, they seem to take you into another world with every song on this album, yet the arrangements are all different. i'm also glad that they use the piano frequently in their music, the piano is an instrument that needs to be in more music today, it really helps put more beauty in the album. the song &quot;Clocks&quot; is one of the best piano/guitar arrangements i've ever heard in my life, and along with this album, i suggest you buy the live Coldplay CD/DVD set, it's amazing as well. only SIMPLETONS label Coldplay as a Radiohead rip off, i wouldn't be caught dead listening to Radiohead, but i'd gladly have a Coldplay song played at my funeral. It's so great to finally hear music this beautiful that takes you into an emotional trance, but it doesn't make you fall asleep...
B000005QH3|5.0|TO ALL FANS OF THIS MOVIE, AT THE END IT IS NOT THE  '70 ,440 SIX PAK CHALLENGER,THAT RUNS INTO THE BULL'DOZERS, IT S A '69 CAMARO. SLOW PLAY IT. THE ORIGINAL STILL EXISTS IN A MUSUEM .    ELENORE, FROM &quot; GONE IN 60 SECONDS &quot; IS ALSO IN A MUSEUM .   TO ME THE SECOND &quot;GONE, W/  NICK CAGE,&quot; SHOULD NOT HAVE BEEN CALL'ED &quot; GONE IN SIXTY SECONDS&quot; .   IT WAS A GOOD FLICK BUT IT SHOULD OF HAD A DIFFERENT TITLE. &quot;GONE&quot; WILL NEVER BE DUPLICATED.
B00004WKII|5.0|I am a fan of the music of Hendrix, not only just his guitar playing. I have been steadily playing guitar for 18 years and Hendrix is undoubtedly a very large influence upon me. I enjoyed this box set primarily from the musical standpoint, not only just from a guitar-oriented standpoint. I was amazed at the glimpses of Hendrix in the studio - even his clowning around is magical - and two cuts found in this set, from the Monterey Pop Festival in 1967, made me chase down that out-of-print CD on eBay. I once owned Jimi's performance at Monterey Pop on tape and had since 1986 worn it out. <BR>I haven't been too keen on many box sets that I've come across, but this Hendrix box set, as well as the Stevie Ray Vaughan box set, have both more than satisified my justification to spend the money to buy them. <BR>If you are a true Hendrix fan and not just a sideline, casual listener, then I highly recommend this box set. I put off buying it for three years. I bought it two weeks ago and this has been the only thing I've listened to steadily since that time. At nearly $55, it is no more expensive than the other box sets out there and to me, was well worth it. I now have everything on CD sold by the Hendrix estate. Buy this, you won't be sorry.
0679428895|4.0|First of all, let me say that if you are fortunate enough to have ever walked the streets of Pompeii, you will love this book.  For those of you who have never seen it for yourself, or have not had an obsessive interest, you may want to pass.<br />I LOVED this story.  Robert Harris captures the last hours of one of the most glorious and corrupt cities in ancient Rome.  The main character, Attilius, is working to find what has caused the failure of the aqueduct. He finds it in pompeii 2 days before the eruption of Vesuvius.  From the heartbreaking prophecy of the city's fame to the final 2 minutes of destruction, Harris somehow manages to place you in the middle of all the action.  I actually cried.
B00005JLTN|1.0|I know I was not alone in the feeling of excitement that was created when the first installment of the Matrix trilogy was released. There, on big screens all across the globe, was a movie daring to tell the truth about the perceptual prison that humanity finds itself trapped in. While many appreciated the movie for its stunning looks and breakthrough special effects, what made the Matrix film so successful was its ability to twist your mind as much as the now famous &quot;bullet cam&quot; twisted your view. Parts 2 &amp; 3 have left us with a stunning illustration of what can only be understood as Illuminati sabotage. <br />Gone from this sequel and the final movie are those breakthrough insights that had so much potential to wake people up. There are some thought provoking scenes but none of them progress to an empowering understanding like the first one featured. Instead, the sequels rely on an even more gigantic helping of animated violence to resolve its conflicts, unsuccessfully I might add. This aspect alone should warn the unlearned viewer that something is amiss. <br />In the final installment... Does the world get destroyed? No, it does not. What we are left with, as the final vision of peace, is a beautiful sunrise shining triumphantly over a glistening corporate cityscape. We are told that those who want to be free of the matrix will be released, but the remaining unawakened will continue to be food for the machines and their matrix lives continued in subservience to their corporate masters. As for the released humans, the movie is silent about their future. Apparently, they will continue to live like rats in the bowels of the earth, as the planet's surface remains environmentally scorched and inhabited by the machines. <br />This is a resolution that is totally unacceptable. It was the efforts of the awakened humans to liberate their trapped brethren that created the original plot conflict in the first place. Now we are supposed to believe that because the machines stopped hunting down the free humans in Zion(?) that those same humans will also stop trying to free those who remained trapped in the Matrix? Viewers are supposed to believe that the best life humans can hope to achieve is one where we still slave most of our lives away to corporate power structures in clean environments? Come-ON Man.<br />What kind of resolution would the unlearned hold out for? Perhaps an insight or two into the multi-dimensional nature of our existence could be explored. It is clear the Wachowski brothers, the makers of the Matrix trilogy, had some message of importance about that very issue. Death was a central event in each of the first two films. Neo's resurrection in the first film illustrated the power of belief while Trinity's revival in the second film attested to the emotional power found in love. In the disappointing finale, both characters die without meaningful insight. It is hard to believe that this anti-climax is the culmination of the previous two film's efforts. <br />To be balanced, it may be that my disappointment is the result my ego's unwillingness to accept death as the final event of awareness, beyond which nothing exists. The human survival instinct is so strong that perhaps we falsely project ourselves into realities that exist only in the mind, to be turned off when the brain ceases all functioning. As the character 'Agent Smith' relates to Neo in his final battle, &quot;Surely you must see by now that your desire for meaning is futile. It's nothing more than a flaw in your fragile species!&quot; <br />But then I am reminded as to who actually provided the funding for these epic blockbusters. Movies don't get made on the charity of people. The big bucks needed to finance movies these days means that artists often have to cow tow to people well funded by the existing power structure. While the profit motive may suppress some corporate objections to empowering movie themes, you can be sure that the most insightful points will be left on the cutting room floor. The Zionist movie studios seem to have succeeded once again in protecting the true matrix that blinds the masses. <br />But in the obviously disappointing ending of Matrix Revolutions, there may be some redeeming quality. If humans are aware enough to see how brutally the script and storyline were gutted, then perhaps one might WAKE-UP to the &quot;true matrix&quot; that the films tried to illustrate metaphorically.<br />In the final analysis, the defeat of the true matrix is possible once humans tap into the power of their multidimensional natures. That our consciousness exists beyond the physical must be converted by the unlearner from a belief into a known. Armed with this knowledge, humans may yet find the courage that is necessary to speak truth to power. <BR>The end of the matrix need not be brought about through the gratuitous violence depicted in the movies, but can be achieved through one's willingness to let love and truth animate their actions and understandings.   <BR>~  unlearning.org
B00001OH7N|4.0|The revisionist reviews are interesting, because hindsight and lack of context colour and distort people's perception.  There is a line between this imperfect very early hard rock album, diamond dogs, and inside/outside.  Do you figure that tin machine was always bowie trying to get back to being a man who sold the world?  He should have known it was one time and one place.  All the madmen was a teenagers anthem, but this is not classic bowie, it is an evolutionary stage.  The greatest thing about the carbon-copy Nirvana cover is that it serves to introduce teenage neophytes to this album - and they dig it.  Kurt Cobain an improvement?  Get a life - or get Lulu's cover version.
B00005JMFR|5.0|Hi! I will begin with the obvious. When it comes to being one of those \\"Die hard\\" fans,I am indeed-BUSTED!!! I was, at first disappointed with Reloaded. Evidently, these 2nd and 3rd parts to The Matrix are the type of movie I've stumbled upon once or twice in my life.These are the types of movies in which I learn and understand more with each viewing. Reloaded didn't take long to become a very special movie for me. The day it FINALLY came to my local IMAX Theater was indeed the day I left the theater with a good old fashion adrenyline rush. It blew my hair back-totally! When I saw Revolutions the day it was released, it kind of bummed me out that Trinity did not open the picture with one of her mind-blowing-and interest provoking stunts. Bravo Carrie-Anne Moss! Anyhow, I thought that Revolutions was most definitely THE most moving, emotionally speaking of course, than any of the three films. By the time Revolutions rolled around, and into our lives,it may have been just me-but I believe for most of the Matrix fans had, by then, grown a strong emotional attachment to the three main characters. Neo, Trinity and Morpheus were like old friends to us by then, and the scene both in the nightclub where Trinity proves her love for Neo, as well as the short conversation she had with Neo, prior to his \\"ultimate battle\\", if you will, brought closure to us all. When I say \\"us all\\", I mean the fans that were there from beginning to end-who were not empty-headed and could comprehend the philosophies as well as the pre-meditated world of the computerized Matrix-it's appearance, which \\"A lesser mind\\" could not pick up on (does greenish tinting ring a bell?)the hidden visual effects and the many wonders which, in our world have yet to be explained; aliens, werewolves, deja-vu's, among other things. The blue coloration within and around the ships as well as most parts of Zion. When I first heard on the promotions for Revolutions...\\"EVERYTHING THAT HAS A BEGINNING HAS AN END\\" indeed made me very sad. I'll never be the same again after The Matrix.  You know why? Because all my life, I wondered to myself...\\"Why do so many things taste like chicken?\\"<BR>FOOD FOR THOUGHT, CHRISTINA.........
B0000C6E4D|2.0|Her beautiful voice is there, with the carefully placed twist and slight crack.  The lush background music seems to have replaced the simpler folk tinged acoustic sound from FTE.  But something is missing.  <br />For one thing, the words have become so generic, you assume this is done for the ease to relate to the song.  Unfortunately, its like drinking water-downed lemonade; you know its lemonade, but you had better.  Occurationally, you'll hear serious words lifted from her previous albums and dropped inbetween these generic words which just feels out of place.<br />As many others have mentioned, this is not Sarahs best work. It feels like she's going throught the motion, singing the words, but without actually conveying the exact feeling behind them. &quot;Fallen&quot; is probably the only notable song while the others you can't tell or remember exactly each songs about.<br />Sarah have had alot of commercial success, and I hope that will continue, with less emphasis on the song texture, presentation and more on substance.
0385507755|5.0|This book is great if you can get past the point that it is really brutal and honest writing. I cant think of a book that I have read recently that tells its tale in a more bare bones style and the results are often upsetting. The writer tells his story (it truly is his story) in a very brash writing style that often reads like poetry - resonating long after the words have crossed your path. Its subject matter is addiction and at times you feel the writer is trying to make you understand the thought process of a true addict through the timing of his prose. Really effective and very original novel.<br />I read a review of someone angry about the writer's story. They are upset because most addicts don't have any college, or any parents, or any money to get them out of their addictions. Having known several addicts in my lifetime, I can understand this bitterness directed at the sickness. I have not read a book that so clearly entertains while sending its message loud and clear. If there were more addicts (recovering) like Mr. Frey writing entertaining and impressive books, then there wouldn't be as many new addicts waiting to be born in our middle schools every day. These problems happen early, like when Mr. Frey started drinking and sniffing glue - 12 or 13 years of age! He is truly lukcy to be alive, and he lets us know it through a great first novel.

The Beatles at their rawest, most energetic, most innocent, and purely simple fun. 40 years later, the magic is still there.

B00005R2M3|4.0|I've had a bit of a biased look on Pop music so finally I decided to let down my guard and go give it a shot.  I decided to try Shakira since I had heard two of her songs before and thought they weren't half bad.  So, I bought the CD and I have to say that I'm very pleased.  It's very energetic which is nice to have once in awhile, she has a very unique voice though I have to agree with the overall statement that it can be somewhat Celene Dion (sp).  Overall, I found the entire CD to flow really well, though some of the songs sound very similar but I assume this is to be expected with Pop.  The reason I took it down a star in the rating is simply that the some of the songs sound very similar but that really doesn't take much away from the CD.  Either way, I would definately recommend this as a first attempt at Pop.  It's not completely pop but it has enough of the elements to let you know whether it's your style of music or not.
0385507755|5.0|This book made me feel like I was sitting next to James Frey. I cringed, gagged, cried, laughed, and routed for him when I wanted to hate him. Read this book and appreciate HIS story. Learn from it, or just marvel in the raw depiction of his struggle, self-loathing, and eventual recovery. This story isn't just about addiction; it's about life and the sometimes ugly road to getting something you want. It's about love, friendship, family, being real with yourself and knowing yourself. Read this book, you will not be sorry.
B0000TB01Y|5.0|I saw Wicked this past December and this show far surpasses many of the shows playing on Broadway today.  Its score is rich and intriguing.  Kristen Chenowith's soprano glistens beautfully in all her songs, and Idina Menzel's powerful pipes surpass eveything!!  The standout songs on the CD are the solos by the Wicked Witch, including &quot;The Wizard and I&quot; &quot;Im not that girl&quot; &quot;No Good Deed&quot; and the beautfilly emotional duet by the two enchantresses &quot;For Good&quot;.  However, the most outstanding track on the CD is the Act 1 Finale, &quot;DEFYING GRAVITY&quot; belted out by the uncomprable Idina Menzel.  The rest of the songs are campy and fun to listen too.  A truely great accomplishment!  Fun to both listen to and see live.  A great buy.  its worth it!!!
B000002H97|5.0|Simply the best album ever.<BR>I've never had a cd before like this one, all 12 tracks are perfect...
0930289234|1.0|I was quite disappointed with Watchmen. I had heard so many great things about it and was expecting a memorable read. Now that I have read it I'm left with a feeling of \\"What was the big deal?\\".  The story was incredibly average. The art was mediocre at best. Alan Moore's writing is eloquent but an eloquently written boring story is still boring. I was expecting a lot more.<br />Three GREAT examples of graphic novels at their best are: Kingdom Come by Alex Ross, the Rising Stars series by J.Michael Straczynski, and The Dark Knight Returns by Frank Miller.
B0000TB01Y|2.0|This is a really disappointing recording.  The music and lyrics are not up to par with the talents of Stephen Schwartz.  The lyrics are all highly commonplace, and sound like uninspired pop writing.   The music as well, rarely soars, and other songs are like bland theme park pop tunes.  None of the musical themes are really new, or creative, you feel like you've heard the ideas used before.<br />What does this recording further injustice, is that I am told, the show is really worth seeing.  But since there is no plot synopsis included, you can't even tell if the story is compelling or how these generic songs fit into the plot.<br />As simple as a musical like \\"SideShow\\" can be at times, it is leaps and bounds ahead of this work, and it seems that Stephen Schwartz used \\"Who Will Love Me As I Am?\\" as a template for \\"For Good\\" -- but the harmonies aren't nearly as interesting.<br />There's quite a story in Gregory MacGuire's novel I imagine -- but I don't think Wicked the musical, manages to find the sensitivity and complexity within it's score.<br />If you're looking for a sacharine tune-stack that sounds like any other radio song, then this is for you.  But if you're seeking character driven, well crafted music with something unique to say, look elsewhere.
B000003TA4|5.0|One of the greatest albums of all time. Here is an album you just don't buy for one song, you buy it for the entire song. Smells Like Teen Spirit is cliche, but a masterpiece. Come As You Are is one of their best songs, just the pain in his voice is amazing. In Bloom and Polly are awesome and Lithium shows exactly how genious Kurt Cobain truely was.
6301930827|5.0|I don't imagine for a second that everyone who's seen this film feels quite as strongly about it as I do and I'm usually far too complacent to write reviews but I felt I owed it to the film and to myself to state my blatantly biassed opinion of this film.<br />It was only by sheer chance that one evening whilst skipping channels randomly, I conviently stopped when I glimpsed the opening credits of this film and although initially I was sceptical, as the film progressed, any unfounded reservations I had swiftly dissipated.<br />The acting is superb throughout with James Earl Jones gracing us with his charismatic screen presence as always. The typecasting was perfection itself with no individual actor letting the side down with a poor performance. The musical score, although limited in variety only adds to the overall sense of doom with it's sinister bass notes resonating like a mushroom cloud.<br />The variety of sets and scenes are intentionally claustrephobic but not lacking in imagination and by no means insular. Lavish presidential and state quarters, hi-tech bomber cockpits and military bunkers embued with a sense of real purpose soon start to feel quite familiar as do the characters.<br />Since it's difficult to rent this title and since VHS tapes are so incredibly cheap now, I would be fool not to encourage anyone reading this review to have a stab in the dark and order it.. if you don't like it, just send it to me and I'll put it in my 'Dawn's early light' shrine ! :P
B000003TAR|5.0|If you want to know if you should buy this CD, listen to Heart-Shaped Box and then Rape Me. There are your reasons to buy it.
B0000DD7LB|5.0|There are no possible words to explain how good this album is. It has amazing songs that will blow you away and make you dance all night long. All of the songs are unique in their own way. My absolute favourite song is Toxic. It has awesome beats and lyrics. I love the video as well. The only filler song on this album is Early mornin&quot;. Really bad song!!! Anyways this album is da bomb. It reached number 1 in it's first week out. It outselled Christina's album by far. Get this album right now! You won't regret it. Britney Spears is my idol. I think she's gonna be around for a long time whether you like her or not.

B00005JLXE|4.0|Daredevil is a good comic book movie. Mark Steven Johnson is still finding his way as a film maker, but his dedication to Daredevil can be seen in every frame of the movie and that's very appealing to me. I'm sure there are a lot of things he wishes he could have done better, but there's still a lot to like about this movie. I wont fill up to much space trying to explain it to those who don't get the appeal. Frank Zappa once said \\"It's simply this. Either you get it or you don't.\\" Roger Ebert saw Daredevil and he gets it too.
B00005JKNF|5.0|While taking all those guided tours through cavernous estate houses in England and Ireland (and even a few on the north shore of Long Island), I always wondered what it was like to live that lifestyle. But of course, walking around those still houses doesn't really tell you about the people who lived there anymore than a stage tells you about its actors. However, Gosford Park was a great way to fill in those blanks. The way it pulls you into the world of 1930's English high society and all its pretense and hypocrisy is great. This movie definitely enlivened my understanding of class in old European societies. <br />The reason Gosford Park has such great insight is the film's screenwriter, Julian Fellows who himself grew up as part of the English aristocracy. Much of what makes this film fun is the idiosyncrasies of its characters and their world that Fellows has personal experience with. A maid and driver stand in the pouring rain until their mistress gets in the car. Servants only refer to each other by their master's name, and they maintain the same hierarchy as their masters so that a duke's servant is treated better by other servants than a baron's. Only married women are allowed to have breakfast in bed; unmarried women must go to the dining room. What a strange world they lived in, especially to someone like me who grew up in a middle class New York neighborhood. <br />The spine of Gosford Park is, without question, NOT the murder mystery. In fact, the murder mystery plot is about 5% of the movie-if that. It's what's known in film lingo as a McGuffin, a device that helps propel the plot in a story but is of little importance in itself. If a viewer turns to the murder mystery plot for what this movie is all about, they will most likely be sorely disappointed, seemingly like many of the negative reviewers here were.<br />The key to enjoying this movie is to think about what it's like to live in a society that is extremely oriented by class. What must it take tokeep it going? As I alluded earlier, pretense and hypocrisy grease the gears of high society. From scene to scene, we peep around corners and into bedrooms to see characters trying to hide one secret or another. And in the end, we see the unpleasant consequences of this duplicity.<br />This is definitely not a film that lays out its purpose before the audience. Since the almost 60 characters (for a chuckle, look under product details above for the colossal cast list) each add something unique to the larger picture, and since the audience is usually only told something once, you definitely have to be your own detective. However, Julian Fellows does a brilliant job interweaving these characters into a solid whole, and he definitely deserves the Oscar he received for the screenplay. <br />Since this is a complex and subtle film, multiple viewings are helpful, but unlike some other reviewers, this is something I really enjoyed. Like a good album, each time with it reveals another layer and increases your appreciation. Robert Altman, the director, says in his DVD commentary (which was boring except for a few insights, but Julian Fellow's commentary was excellent) that the film is \\"like looking in through the windows of a house, you only get part of the picture at a time.\\" I think this analogy fits nicely, especially since the film is set in a house. Altman also acknowledges what some of the negative reviewers complain about, saying he meant the audience to be left wondering after the first viewing. He didn't intend this movie for the \\"wham, bam, thank you ma'am\\" set. In fact, Altman went out of his way to insert curse words, guaranteeing an R rating so that \\"14 year old boys couldn't walk off the street and watch it.\\"<br />And of course, last but not least, the acting was great. Gosford Park has an excellent ensemble cast with not a single weak link. Maggie Smith as the snobbish Aunt makes you smile; Kelly MacDonald as the Aunt's young, innocent maid makes you want to give her a big wet kiss (maybe that's just me); and Clive Owen's cool restraint as a mysterious footman keeps you following him around the screen.<br />All through, Gosford Park is a movie very well done.
0385504209|5.0|I don't usually get into suspense/mystery thrillers, which made my discovery of this novel that much more of a pleasant surprise.  Its power, of course, comes from the fact that it builds on actual theories and little-known facts about ancient events and the formation of the early church.  It whetted my appetite to find out more.  Extremely thought-provoking and highly recommended.
B0000DD7LB|3.0|O.K. I haven't liked Britney in awhile, but I bought this C.D. the day it came out. It's not anything great, but if you liked her old stuff such as &quot;Baby One More Time&quot;, there's no doubt that you will like this. &quot;Toxic&quot; is probably the best track on the album, but stay clear of &quot;Touch of my Hand&quot; and &quot;Showdown&quot;. I think she needs to start trying some new types of music on her next C.D. though because this one is like the last few. I couldn't give it a higher rating even though I am a Britney fan, because it is obvious she doesn't posess much talent. If you want to hear talent, buy Christina Aguilera's 'Stripped' C.D. I promise you woun't be let down.

B000002I27|4.0|I gave \\"Strange Days\\" only 4 stars because I believe no Doors album, by itself, is 5-star worthy (though this one comes the closest). The Doors' entire catalog, however, is much greater than the sum of its parts, and deserves 5-stars without question. <br />THE POSITIVES: This album is, arguably, their darkest. The mysterious, cloudy mood it creates is unique, to say the least(and unmatched, even after almost 40 years). The Doors also experimented with the studio more during the making of this album, hence the many eerie sounds in almost every song. The percussion is finally mixed properly, making Densmore's drumming more crisp-sounding than the first album, with the rest of the band sounding more pronounced as well (thanks, in part, to a bass player on several tracks). This is not an album to listen to on a warm, sunny day, or with all the lights on. <br />THE NEGATIVES: Very few, if any. \\"Unhappy Girl\\" is the weakest song on the album, but it's still a decent song, and fits into the scheme of the rest of the songs.

B000002I25|4.0|I give this album only 4 stars because no Doors album, by itself, is 5-star worthy. However, The Doors' catalog is greater than the sum of its parts; hence, their entire collection deserves 5 stars, without question.<br />THE POSITIVES: The music is very solid, but the mood the album creates is even more astounding. The sound of this, their first album, was nothing like all the hippie/flower-power drivel that was being played at the time. It established The Doors as a musically powerful yet dark and mysterious force. To this day, their sound has never been successfully duplicated. <br />THE NEGATIVES: Only one, really. The drums are mixed too low, so the percussion in most of the songs (except for the cymbals) is not pronounced enough.
B00000JFV9|5.0|Ron \\"Youngblood Priest a.k.a Superfly\\" O'Neal died of cancer.  Bless him.  He created a style and genre all his own.  The term \\"superfly\\" is still used today.  Buy the CD by Curtis Mayfield.  Not only is the music classic, but it defined an era pre-Matrix.
B000002I2I|4.0|I gave \\"Morrison Hotel\\" only 4 stars because I believe no Doors album, by itself, is 5-star worthy (though this one comes the closest). The Doors' entire catalog, however, is much greater than the sum of its parts, and deserves 5-stars without question. <br />THE POSITIVES: \\"Morrison Hotel\\" is the Doors' purest rock-n-roll album, with a non-pretentious sound that signaled the end of the 1960s. It sounds almost nothing like its predecessors, but that is not necessarily a bad thing (or a good thing, depending on why you like The Doors' music). Roadhouse Blues, Land Ho, Maggie M'Gill, and You Make Me Real are good ol' fashioned rock-n-roll songs that deserve to be played at full volume. Waiting for the Sun is a left-over from the album with the same name, and, as such, sounds somewhat out of place (but still a REAL good song). Indian Summer is another leftover (from their self-titled first album) that is a beautiful song but, again, would have sounded better on the first album. <br />THE NEGATIVES: Very few. Queen of the Highway is a relatively weak song. If you want to hear a better version of it, listen to it on the box set. The Spy is OK, but it drags.
B00006879E|5.0|I first heard Maroon 5 when they came to my college in August as part of Welcome Week for freshman.They came and played a free concert and I am not one to turn down going to a free concert and I WAS BLOWN AWAY. These guys are absolutely amazing. They are so unique, that you can't compare them to anyone else out there. There is nothing negative I can say about this album. There are very few albums that I have that the more I listen to the cd the more I like, and this cd is one of those. My absolute favorite song is &quot;Not Coming Home.&quot; These guys are amazing and I suggest everyone buy their album.
B000007S5B|4.0|I gave \\"Waiting for the Sun\\" only 4 stars because I believe no Doors album, by itself, is 5-star worthy. The Doors' entire catalog, however, is much greater than the sum of its parts, and deserves 5-stars without question. <br />Judging by what Krieger and Densmore have said over the years, it appears they believe \\"Waiting for the Sun\\" to be The Doors' weakest album. I disagree, for what that's worth. <br />THE POSITIVES: The album uses thunderbass and distortion on several songs, a welcome addition to the already mysterious Doors sound. \\"Waiting for the Sun\\" is a natural evolution from the previous two albums, though more pop sounding at times. The album did, however, produce some of the most hard-hitting Doors songs ever, including \\"Five to One,\\" \\"Not to Touch the Earth,\\" and \\"Unknown Soldier.\\" <br />THE NEGATIVES: A couple of goofy songs, such as \\"Wintertime Love\\" and \\"Yes, the River Knows.\\" They are too pop sounding, and stray too far from what The Doors had done so far. Nice piano in \\"Yes, the River Knows,\\" however. <br />This album is quite good, but bi-polar. The songs are either loud and heavy, or soft & dainty. Nonetheless, I recommend.
B0000A1RJI|4.0|I really like it!  I loved the score so much, I bought the DVD when it was released, but have since sold it and got just the score.  One gripe: the melody in tracks like &quot;He's a Pirate&quot; is almost EXACTLY the same as Hans Zimmer's melodic themes in the Gladiator score (a far superior movie and score, IMO).  Not that I care, since I like this melody so much, however I can't help but notice that I can whistle both scores interchangably.
B00004XPP0|5.0|Like I said above Star Wars is a amazing wonder.It's lasted for many years in great popularity! Toys,rereleases in theaters,books,it's done grand.But times change.Star Wars prequals have tried to compete with this new great wonder trilogy of the 21 century,But have failed I think for being the most spectacular.The greatest trilogy(so far)for a Millenium is THE LORD OF THE RINGS!!!!!!! I almost have to say it beats the old Star Wars Trilogy a little.NOT speacial effects even,but the plot,heart felt acting,and a mythological feeling.Beats the Force.Star Wars is no longer the best and only fantasy.For one thing the preaquals have sad ending and the plot is not as speacial as Lord of the Rings.Thats why it's not as popular.I never felt Return of the Jedi blasted it's predesesors completely.Return of the King even outdid it's Helms Deep battle and the emotion was fever pitch with Sam having to carry Frodo and even Aragorn's almost failure and it really made you believe that Middle Earth would be no more!I think it's still climatic when Lukey defeats Darth Vader and he changes.The ending is good but Lord of the Rings is more fufilling.Isn't it cute when Sam greets his family and closes the door on a Epic?
B00004STPT|5.0|AMAZING score!!!! of course though, I never expect anything less from Hans Zimmer :)  Great variety, original.  My favorite movie as well.  I recommend tracks The Battle and Now We Are Free, even if the lyrics are all jibberish (also, for a faster moving version, download the Maximus Mix).
B0000C7GG2|5.0|OK, I've read all of the Muse reviews for all three albums and to be quite honest: I think your 100% right. Muse are now definately one of the best new rock bands in the world. But I'm kind of on a slant here because to me, Muse doesn't sound like Radiohead at all. I mean I'm not just saying that because I don't like Radiohead, I do a lot. But to me Muse whoops Radiohead's 'too depressing' ass off the Planet. Absolution cuts in with an errie 'beat-beat-beat' thats gets louder and louder until finally kicking into what is, I think, one of the best songs on the album, 'Apocalypse Please'. Then we see the already released tracks: 'Time is Running Out', 'Stockholm Syndrome' and 'Hysteria', all with there own rock exteriors and mellow side-pieces. After that the ablbum just gets better and better with songs such as 'Falling Away with You', 'Butterflies and Hurricanes' and 'The Small Print'. They also show there more emotional side with tracks like 'Blackout', 'Endlessly' and 'Ruled by Secrecy'. Overall I think that Absolution is one of the best albums to have hit us in recent in years. The new rock market has been flooded with was outs like The Doves, Coldplay and the Stereophonics. But with Muse: Is There Any Getting Better?
B0000CDL93|3.0|The problem with this film is the character of Jim Garrison and especially the final scene where's he realises he's bundled the Clay Shaw prosecution and tries to get a 'guilty' verdict by making a speech about American Citizenship instead.  Shoddy lawman if you ask me.  He's not much of a father either.  His family sit in the courtroom at the end of the movie looking up to Garrison like he's some kind of hero and as if he was right to ignore them and treat them badly but he loses the case because of his own amateurishness not because of any judicial conspiracy.  Not much of a pay-off for his kids who've had to amuse themselves for a couple of years while their dad has his head buried in books.  I can't help thinking if it had been Atticus Finch he would have won the court case -and- been good to his family.<br />On the evidence Stone gives, it is possible to see Garrison as a courageous investigator but not as a rigorous or accomplished lawyer.  This for me definitely takes away from any of the points he's trying to make.  The Donald Sutherland theory is a little bit too much to swallow as well.  Most of the other people who have written about the JFK murder stop short of implicating Lyndon Johnson.  <br />It's a shame because it's obviously such a landmark movie, accomplished in so many ways and Stone ruins it by staying so true to the District Attorney.  Maybe this was part of the book deal but I would have preferred to see Stone be a bit harder on him.
B0000TB01Y|5.0|Okay, before you buy this CD, make sure that you like Kristin described as an acquired taste.  But really, Kristin's voice is the only subjective aspect of this brilliant collection.  The music is uplifting and sensitive- everything that a musical score should be.  The lyrics are very touching and the vocal talent is stellar.  Idina Menzel's powerful voice takes the music to new levels with her expressive style.  She shines in all of her ballads and really belts her heart out on the show-stopper, &quot;Defying Gravity&quot;.  Kristin Chenoweth deserves a Tony for her character work and the highly amusing &quot;Popular&quot;, which is even more hilarious when seen on stage.  Norbert Leo Butz also delivers a flawless performance, as usual.  He portrays the relaxed Fiyero with grace and style, never faltering despite his challenging vocal part.  The duets between Kristin and Idina show the true spirit of this show- friendship and collaboration.  Both performers display their awesome talent without overshadowing the other.  Outstanding music and lyrics surpassed only by the terrific talent of the lead performers.
B000001FND|4.0|Horizontal is the Bee Gee second English released album. It also has the coolest looking cover in my opinion.  In this 1967 release the brothers are breaking away from their prior Beatle-esque sound and going for a more psychedelic British Invasion<br />pop.<br />The album begins strongly with World. It's somewhat depressing lyrics are repeated and crescendo as the song closes. World is a great opener, combining the old with this new touch of psychedelic.<br />And The Sun Will Shine, however, is the complete opposite of World. Today, nearly 40 years after its release, this is still one of the most often quoted songs by the Robin faithful.  My niece is almost seven and she loves this song! It's ironic, since most of the lyrics make no sense, as many<br />of the early Robin songs don't. His quavering delivery is impeccable.  The one line that makes any sense, 'Love to me is life, and I live you', may be the definitive if one had to summarize the late sixties Robin. (Fans of this version should also hear the live rendition on One Night Only. Perhaps tops the original!  )<br />Lemons Never Forget is the album's first true psychedelic outing. I got into some trouble in my household for going around singing the opening lyric, `Incidently there should be some changes made.'  Barry is very strong here. His voice is somehow harder or more edgy then the soft Beatle-esque sound or the breathy sound that would follow. Combined with the heavy music, the style is surprising and effective.<br />Really and Sincerely is the second sorrowful Robin outing. Those who do not like his early sound (My mother!) may not like this album.  However in my opinion, one can never get bored with this album do to the constant vocal rotation between<br />the brothers. The placement of the track list is well done. Really and Sincerely's one fault is that its two songs after And The Sun Will Shine. It has a very `old world' and operatic feel. Very beautiful to fall asleep to!<br />Birdie Told Me sounds more like the songs on First. It's got a sweet and simple sixties melody combined with a very easy listening Barry. The harmonies are also top notch. Some say its too simple, and it is a bit short, but when listening you can follow the story from the breakup to the moving on. A surprisingly happy sounding song, given its subject matter.<br />With The Sun In My Eyes is the return to mellow. Again a very beautiful song, except we've already hear two similar songs. It's almost as if Horizontal is two different albums, one mellow, one psychedelic.  Some may like that, others may not. You listen and decide!<br />Next are the two more upbeat songs on Horizontal. Massachusetts is such a great song, The Bee Gees first Number One.  It's a great against type song, talking about staying home instead of going to San Francisco. You can't help but get into this<br />song. This is my father's favorite. When my sister saw One Night Only for the first time, she was surprised at 'the other two brothers' singing.  My Dad exclaimed, 'You mean you've never heard Massachusetts?!'<br />Fast in pace is the next song, Harry Braff. This to me is the `fun' song on this album. At first listen I thought they were saying `Chicken' instead of `Checkered'.  It's up and down beat will either tap your foot or drive you insane. It almost sounds like the racing cars the song describes. Very 60s and very British.<br />Daytime Girl is the Maurice outing of the album. His voice is soft and has just the right amount of spacey edge for the lyrics. I'm not sure exactly what he is talking about, but this tune reminds me of Lesbian Seagull in Beavis and Butthead! Worth the listen though, if only to hear Mo. Unfortunately, Maurice's early leads tend to show him as weak lyrically. On the next two albums, Suddenly and My Thing also don't do Mo justice.  I'm not sure any song does. Maurice is at his best harmonizing and arranging and strengthening Barry and Robin. His accent sounds cool in this one though.<br />Where Daytime Girl was the sort of slow psychedelic. There is no mistaking the last three tracks. The Earnest Of Being George is the tenth track, but I swear I never hear the title uttered in the song. This is another one that seems to make no sense, but its irregular stops and starts are an unexpected bonus, in addition to the uniquely placed harmonies. The Change is Made is probably the best psychadelic on the album. The lyrics are almost understandable and the sound is excellent. Barry is on form. If I had to pick one word to describe this song its 'fresh'.<br />The album concludes with the title song. Horizontal is both psychedelic and mellow. Again the Bee Gees start and finish strong with this song, similar to World. The odd harmonies and irregular holds on notes are almost over the top, but it works. Several B sides and singles from this album, found on The Tales From The Brothers Gibb Cd, further show the branching out The brothers were experimenting with. Sir Geoffrey Saved The World, Barker of The UFO, and Sinking Ships are quirks, but the hit Words would go on to exemplify the broken hearted sound.<br />The album Horizontal is a pivotal step in The Bee Gees transition from Beatle imitators to the broken hearted song maestros we know today. Each 60s album, in my opinion tops the previous album. Without Horizontal, The Bee Gees would not have had the early and subsequent success that they did.  I Love My 60s Bee Gees!<br />Where Daytime Girl was the sort of slow psychedelic. There is no mistaking the last three tracks.

B00002E23E|5.0|When I first bought this I had heard that it wasnt that good. Boy Were those people ever wrong, this is one of the best concert films I have ever seen, if not the best!<br />The Musical performance is amazing here. John Bonham is killer on the drums, when I saw them play 'Moby Dick' and Bonham went into that amazing drum solo it blew my mind! John Paul Jones tears of the bass and when he plays the keyboards on 'No Quarter' its so freakin cool! Robert Plants vocals are great like always. Jimmy Pages guitar playing is insane, I was watching them play 'Since I've Been Loving You' and Jimmy has to be one of the top guitar players ever, as if you didnt already know that. The song selection is great! Every song they play is a Led Zeppelin Classic.<br />The film footage is a great touch to an already steller experince. Like during 'The Rain Song' wear Robert Plant is all mid-evil and ridding horses and stuff its really cool!<br />This is one of the best rock and roll films ever made, its almost as good as The Doors, and that is saying a lot!
0684833395|1.0|Catch-22 was a terrible book. It was the worst thing I have ever been forced to read. It should not be taught in schools due to it's terrible language and the way women are depicted in this book. The humor in the book is just retarded and although some parts are kinda funny, you want to kill yourself reading the book before you get to them. I hate this book.
B0000C9V3T|5.0|The soundtrack of kill bill vol 1 is great. It's epical and ethereal.
B0000CAQ27|2.0|First off, I like Pink.  But this CD doesnt give me much.  &quot;Trouble&quot; is great.  &quot;God is a DJ&quot; is good.  But thats about it.  Its one of those CD's we all have where only one or two songs are likeable, and the rest are just bad.  It now spends most of its time collecting dust in the CD holder.
B00005JMCT|4.0|First off, the movie is mistitled.  The movie should have been called \\"American Stifler\\", cause Sean William Scott OWNS this movie.  His interaction with the characters (namely Finch) is hysterical, and every moment he is on screen, you will be laughing.  The dance scene is brilliantly executed.  Stifler is great.  Finch continues to nail his roll, and will keep you grinning.  The rest of the cast doesn't really excel, though they all manage to pull off respectable performances.  But they were all more interesting in the first 2 films.
B00005K3NR|5.0|This film launched the career of Stephen King as one of the writers whose work has been most assiduously plundered by Hollywood. Not to mention a supporting role for an utterly unknown actor in his early twenties by the name of John Travolta. It was by no means Brain de Palma's first movie but it was the breakthrough movie that got him on the A-list. And it's highly de Palmaesque: imagine Alfred Hitchcock but with any capacity Hitchcock had for subtlety and understatement taken away and de Palma is pretty well what you get as this movie abundantly illustrates. <br />It's about a schoolgirl, Carrie White, beautifully played by the extraordinary Sissy Spacek. She is bullied by her classmates but school is not half as bad as her home life where she is tormented by her insane religious fanatic mother. This dreadful woman played by Piper Laurie who reads to her daughter from a big book called \\"The Sins of Women\\" and thinks menstruation is evil is, for my money, the least satisfying aspect of the film. Are there really people this bonkers? Well probably I suppose: modern America must be pretty close to plenitude when it comes to the possibilities of madness. But still I think a more interesting movie would have located someone like Carrie in an adolescent environment that was hellish in more ordinary, less wildly over the top ways which, let's face it, can still be extremely hellish. <br />By someone like Carrie I mean someone who can do telekinesis, that being the film's central idea. It's a horror movie in virtue of the mayhem these powers of hers let loose at the end but in fact the first hour and a bit isn't horror at all, just a drama about Carrie and her tribulations with her cruel classmates and insane mother. The telekinesis does manifest itself in these early stages but in decidedly tame and unterrifying ways like knocking over ashtrays. <br />The most striking - and notorious - scene in this early, dramatic part of the movie is the very first, set in the school's girls' shower room. And as you'd expect with that setting and this director it's a scene with an atmosphere of considerable voyeurism. Then suddenly there is blood and terror from Carrie whom nobody has told about periods and her conviction that something is horribly wrong with her prompts immediate cruel hilarity among her classmates which then obviously makes her all the more distressed. Punishment results for this cruelty which a teacher has witnessed, punishment which leaves one of the perpetrators with a guilty desire to help Carrie integrate and another which a vindictive desire to spite her yet further. The playing out of these contrasting determinations is what drives most of the ensuing plot. <br />A dimension in which the film is particularly successful is in conveying a genuine sense of tragedy. The destructive rage of the climactic scenes when everything goes horribly wrong results from Carrie's confused and panicked overreaction to a vicious prank at a point when she really seems well on the way to sorting out her problems. She seems to have learned how to stand up to her horrible mad mother. And although the invitation she gets to the school prom is motivated, unknown to her, by pity and guilt, it's caused her for the first time to make enough of an effort with her appearance to make it suddenly apparent to everyone that she is easily the most gorgeous girl in the school. Acceptance and normality seem to beckon. And then... Lots of blood, lots of fire and suddenly everybody (well more or less everybody) is dead. And these final scenes of mayhem and horror, it must be said, are orchestrated and directed by de Palma with considerable brilliance.
B000089RVX|4.0|I'm no musicologist, nor am I a pop reviewer. But, pardon the cliche, I know what I like. And I like Fallen.<BR>A lot.<BR>There is undeniable energy and passion in Ben Moody's lyrics and Amy Lee's vocals. There is also hurt and longing and fear and love, and it all feels *real,* at least to me. Sure, it's mostly dark, and unhappy, but there are times when that is *exactly* what I want to hear.<br />I'm not going to make razor distinctions between what is 'rock,' and what is 'pop' anyway: Those arguments are largely wasted mental energy, and pointless. They get in the way of the *purpose* of music, which is to be enjoyed. Define for me, if you can, what makes music 'fake' or 'real.' I defy you. If you enjoy the music, who cares under what 'technical' category it falls?! Who cares if it was made for commercial success, or for the personal enjoyment of the artist, or to satisfy some coterie of self-appointed arbiters of 'real' music?<br />What matters is: Do you like it? If so, then listen; If not, don't. Criticize Fallen for being shallow, if you wish, or for lack of technical mastery, or for being a short-lived trend, but this CD will be on my play list for years. It moves *me,* and that's enough.
0679428895|4.0|Pompeii shows Robert Harris at the top of his form.  As he's done before in Fatherland and Archangel, he meticulously creates a world.  In fact, this novel represents his most ambitious attempt to do so.  Pompeii chronicles the efforts of Marcus Attlius to uncover why the crucial aqueduct that serves the nine towns around the Bay of Naples has failed.  To do so he must contend with both human malice and increasingly violent acts of nature.<br />Most readers will know what is going to happen in this book (though at least one here seems to have thought that the events in the book were occurring in Greece, so I guess you never know).  What is remarkable about this book is that our foreknowledge of the critical event in it does not lessen its dramatic tension in the slightest.<br />Why is that so?  Pompeii has nicely drawn characters, from the young and occasionally impetuous Attlius, to the historically based Pliny, the venal Ampliatus, and an impressive host of minor characters that are encountered.  The world of first century Rome is restored confidently.  What I found refreshing was that the book worked comfortably within its present; it did not feel the compulsion to work constantly at adding backstory, nor was that necessary.  This book will not tell you who Julius Caesar or Augustus were, and you don't need to know it to enjoy it fully.  What it does offer is a wonderfully nuanced and lively portrait of Roman life, making it as valuable in some ways as works of history.  I, for one, would be very happy if Harris wrote another Roman novel.
B00005YW4H|5.0|Nora Jones' voice was purpose-made for smokey jazz lounges. Her voice, aged-whisky smooth, wraps around you and pulls you into the song, whether you will it or not. It's irresistible and inevitable. Possessing tallent, phrasing, and control rarely heard on the radio these days, she single-handedly brought me back to jazz, and if for no other reason, Come Away With Me would be on my all-time favorites list. Of course, there's much more to love about Ms. Jones than merely her rich voice and technical skill. While her own material is weaker, perhaps, than her covers of past greats, she still has what it takes to set a mood and carry you away. When she *is* covering someone else's work, she never copies them, but rather does them respect by reaching to her utmost, and producing her own level-best while remaining distinctly herself. That 'level-best' is mighty damn good, indeed!<br />If you haven't listened to her yet, you really ought to do yourself a favor and get an earful of Ms. Jones. Even if jazz isn't your bag, it never hurts to hear it sung the way it *ought* to be sung.
0446677450|5.0|During the last month I have played the Cashflow 101 game and found it to be the most educational game for adults and children alike. I would highly recommend it for anyone trying to get out of the rat race or for young people trying to learn how to handle their finances.  It is a game more complex and diverse than monopoly.
B00009TB5G|5.0|Following after The Fellowship of the Ring, The Two Towers continues off with Frodo and Sam on the quest to bring the ring to Mt. Dune.  They discover later that Golem (Smeagle) is following them and they engage in confrontation.  They fight at first and they have Golem lead the way to the black gates.  Aaragorn, Legolas, and Gimili set on their side of the journey to meet up with Frodo and Sam but also finding the other two hobbits (Merry and Pippin).  Merry and Pippin are taken by orcs and they escape into a forest where the tree's come alive at night.  They make friends with the leader of the woods and they go on an adventure together.  Later, Aaragorn, Legolas, and Gimili meet up with someone they thought they would never see again.  They meet up with Gandalf who is now Gandalf The White after beating the &quot;ancient beast&quot; known in the first as &quot;shadow and flame&quot;.  They reunite and set off to Mordor.  In my own opinion, I thought The Two Towers was alright when I saw the ORIGINAL theatrical release.  When I bought the Special Extneded DVD Edition, it was better because they show a lot of extra footage and extended takes which explained more like in the Fellowship on the extnded edition.  The Two Towers is something that everyone should have if you are a fan of The Lord of the Rings.  GO AND GET IT ^_^<br />This is my review on The Two Towers.  Thankyou
B00005JLD4|5.0|In 1931 Australia, A.O. Neville, working within the boundaries of the law, forcibly removes three half-caste girls from their aboriginal home.  The three girls -- Molly, Daisy and Gracie -- are sent 1,200 miles from their home in Jigalong to a school for children such as themselves, half-aborigine, half-white.  the camp strives to assimilate the children into the white culture through such things as church and disallowing the use of their native language.  Molly is determined, though, to make it back to her mother, and on a day threatening rain, she, Gracie and Daisy escape from the school.  The only way to make it back to Jigalong is to walk the 1200 miles along the rabbit-proof fence that stretches the entire length of Australia.<br />This film tells the true story of the girls' trek across Australia through such dangers as hunger, thirst, the desert and an aboriginal tracker who is just as determined to re-capture them.  With stunning cinematography, a fine script and marvelous direction from Phillip Noyce, the viewer is drawn into this harrowing story.  Peter Gabriel's score suits the setting and subtles acts to enrich the emotional impact of the film.  The acting is equally good with Kenneth Branagh as A.O. Neville who earns the nickname \\"Devil\\" and David Gulpilil as the aboriginal tracker.  the best performances, though, come from the three young girls: Tianna Sansbury as Daisy, the youngest; Laura Monaghan as Gracie, who forces herself to escape with Molly; and Everlyn Sampi as Molly, the head-strong young girl determined to let nothing stop them from returing home.<br />This is a powerful true story, full of emotion.  Definitely not one to miss.
0385507755|1.0|BOOK REVIEW: A Million Little Pieces by James Frey<BR>You Can't Judge This Book by Its Cover<BR>That's right.  The best component of James Frey's autobiographical novel is the cover.  A great cover.  One of the best book covers I have seen in years - it really catches your eye, it really draws you in. The insert flap is semi-interesting (probably because it was not written by Frey himself), not original, but good enough to pique your interest and see what it is all about. The problem comes when you open it.<BR>  The prose - I hope - is meant to be intentionally simple.  Simple with short sentences that cry to hit home, but this Frey is no Hemingway.  No, just about every word does not feel authentic, but over done, over cooked, over zealous, trying too hard - DO YOU GET THE POINT?  Absolutely as dramatic as they come; and although I may not be a professional writer, I am an alcoholic, so I semi-know of where I speak.  As an alcoholic, the only thing I did enjoy was Frey's staunch opposition to Alcoholics Anonymous' 12 Step Recovery Program (Lord, knows that quasi-cult-new religion for the 20th/21st century needs to go or at least come healthy competition - but it works if you work it right; sorry, to get off topic).  It is sad that I have to doubt the author's prowess; that he so readily (over dramatically, of course) boasts of it, as if it was the only thing he was ever good at in life.  I am probably way off base, but I am skeptical that he consumed as much drugs and alcohol as he did, and that he has done as much internal damage to as many organs as he claims. Who knows if this is dramatic license or not?<BR>Although what I do know about the protagonist, the author himself, is that he is a completely unlikable, snot nose brat with rich, but loving and concerned parents and this 23 year old punk, old enough to know better,  appears to be unmoved by their sacrificing.  So painfully dramatic when it comes to scenes with his parent's I almost needed to put the book down and watch a soap opera on the Soap Channel instead...really.  He: DOES NOT WANT TO SEE THEM - oh, poor baby is ashamed, and numb and emotionless, and sadly, it all feels unauthentic - done for effect.<BR> For the most part,  what can be said of Frey is that he is one hell of a jerk to almost everyone he encounters.  Just about the entire autobiography takes place in a rehab clinic. During his stay, Frey is unnecessarily rude to just about everyone, (Yeah, yeah we get you, your angry, withdrawing, hating yourself, blah, blah, blah.) except for a retired mafia guy (who will be played by Danny Aiello if there is ever a film adaptation), and some ex-prostitute whom the clinic forbids him to speak to, (keeping with the men to the men, women to the women - the famous  12 Step/AA philosophy for new people in recovery).  And the book goes on, and on, stubborn young man routine just rolls on and collects much moss as it rolls.  A complete drag - humorless, less than insightful, and it is better off left to collect dust in the recovery section of the bookstores.<BR>  Incidentally, the audio addition is far, far, worse, having been read in this annoyingly urgent phony voice by some no name actor who lives in Los Angeles. So bad, in fact that the compact disks themselves might jump out of your cd player and run to the nearest bar or crack house to dull the pain of their abridged (thank God) audio book existence.<BR>    But damn, what a great cover - designers Rodrigo Corral and Christopher Marble are the only ones who deserve the praise in this one.
B0000CEB4V|5.0|A lot of value packed into this 2 dvd set, with the complete concert and the theatrical version edited with interviews, etc. The performances are excellent and done tastefully. It is apparent that all these musicians came together to honor Harrison, rather than to bring recognition to themselves. A must for Harrison fans.
0060523808|4.0|&quot;Who Says Elephants Can't Dance&quot; is the history of Louis Gerstner, Jr.'s tenure at IBM.  Mr. Gerstner joined IBM at a critical time when sales were slumping and the behemoth of a company was laying people off almost every quarter.  What they needed was someone who could turn the company around and take it to new heights.  What they had was a complex bureaucracy that allowed little change and tended to support the continued decline of the company.  Of course we all know now that Mr. Gerstner was able to change IBM and produce a viable thriving company able to compete in the world markets once again.  This is the story of what happened from Louis Gerstner's own hand.<br />Mr. Gerstner provides insight into his viewpoint of what was happening in the company and his own fears and concerns from before the day he was named CEO until his retirement in 2002.  If you want to know what was happening at the top and what he was thinking as he went along, you will want to read this book.  If you read and liked Lee Iococca's book on his turnaround of Chrysler you will find this book similar and also very interesting in its own right.  A study in tough management and changing direction with a company that has its own momentum, &quot;Who Says Elephants Can't Dance&quot; is a recommended read.
B0000DYJM6|3.0|PJ has been my favorite band for many years now.  This 2 disc compilation is a great addition to any Pearl Jam fans collection, including mine.  I like the songs (most of which I'd heard already live or in some other form), and the blurbs in the album cover.  <br />HOWEVER, the fact that they added Brother, an old school rarity favorite of mine, and butchered it by not including lyrics makes me extremely angry.  They didn't even mention anything about this in the booklet.  I was so excited to see that Brother made the cut and I started screaming and yelling obscenities when I heard no lyrics.  Did Ed forget the lyrics over the years?  He couldn't learn them again from an old recording?
B0000AXE8I|1.0|I have been reading some reviews that other people have written and a few times I have come across people comparing these movies to Star Wars.  Are you serious?  Were you people drugged when you watched these movies, or are you just incrediabily simple?  If you like flashy lights and no sense then I could see how you would like this movie, but if you have half a brain you would realize that this movie blows.  It's just as bad as Revolutions, which made the undertones of Neo being Jesus so blanted that they were basically overtones.  Anyway, this movie has nothing on the original Star Wars triliogy and it really isn't better than any of the new crappy Star Wars either.  If you wanna see a good movie look elsewhere.
B00008PW2D|4.0|DVD Price aside, this short season was just as entertaining as the prior four.  The Girls still have the same chemestry as they did before, and WHO IN THIS WORLD can not recognize the fabulous scene when Samantha dresses in that *wig* and glasses to catch Richard cheating!!!????  Amazing.  Not to mention the laughable and hilarious pillow-case-dress SJP was wearing at the wedding in the last episode!  I enjoyed every episode of this season.  As with every episode of SITC, when one storyline fails another brilliant one rises up to take its place.  And for those of you contemplating this purchase, remember that when you're reading the reviews on here, you've got to find objectivity and separate the poor reviews of the price of the DVD's versus the reviews of the season itself.  I would recommend this season in a heartbeat.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I never knew about Firefly.  I saw one show, and I liked it, but I never really got a chance to watch the rest since I had to work mostly nights, and then Fox did a horrible job at promoting it.<br />Well now its on DVD, and I have watched it all. And I am very pleased.  The whole show is worth its weight in gold.  Alot of very catchy lines and some memorable scenes.<br />The main theme song is very good (writen by Joss himself).  The characters can be slap-stick funny when they need to be, and serious when they have to be.  The cast was well selected, and every one plays off the other very well.<br />Many un-answered questions, but hopefully the Movie (When it comes out) will answer a good deal, but leave us with more.<br />So if you are bored with some of the other space-action stuff, need something new, give this a try.  Find a friend who has a copy and watch at least the first episode (the Pilot is Kind of slow for some), and if you enjoy it, grab it!  I don't think you will be let down.
B00008DDSC|4.0|American movies about personalities are relatively rare, since the focus is rather on the subject. This one is a fine materialization about weird, yet lovely people.<br />James Spader taking the role of a yellow man, with all the cynical characters that you might find in a lawyer, as if he was born to play such role, and Maggie Gyllenhaal, the sweet beautiful young actress, is amazing in the role of an accidental secretary.<br />Both personalities have strange alienations, maneuvering the sexual (or sensual) relation between them, and developing it based on the courage and tenacious of revealing, though discretely, the freaky approach to interactive with the other became a masterpiece.<br />The movie starts with an invitation by Edward (the lawyer) to Lee (the secretary) to the world of submission that found a receptive answer; the sequences of the movie show the development of an S/M relation in a smart funny way, never boring or exaggerating. The scenes are not explicit to the extent of being offensive to normal viewer, because the movie concentrates on the buildup of the relation so you amazingly find yourself watching the hot succession of a love story. Moreover, pushing things to the limits is something usual in such relations, and it has been presented in a very logic way in the film. The determined sacrifices of the sub (Lee) as the last showdown, replied to by the complicated hesitation of the top (Edward) push the revelation to the ultimatum: we love each other this way.<br />I really loved this movie, found it very spicy and colorful. With the new wave in cinema, were cost, graphic and technology rating the film and attracting the fans, it is so hard to provide such intentionally (definitely not compulsory) low budget, well made and extremely rich film.<br />One minor non-avoidable defect: the joy of watching it for the first time is not repeatable, so if you want to own it, it would be simply for it existence among the collection to remind you about a warm sweet experience.m sweet experience.
6302797519|4.0|Lord Jim expresses the ups and downs of a sailors life and how every port was his home. To me that is the best type of plot for any movie or novel. I give this move two thumbs up but PLEASE RELEASE ONTO DVD!!!!!!!!
B0000TB050|5.0|I own just about every cd/dvd that U2 has made.  This dvd will give you the chills each time you see how far the enormous crowd goes back past the castle.  Sound in DTS is incredible.
B000002WU9|5.0|If someone would steal this CD from my collection, that would be the worst and the last mistake that that human-being does. This is just one of the graetest ever, and Wu-Tang's best album with Enter the 36 Chambers and Liquid Swords. This is gangsta rap in it's purest form.  Only Built 4 Cuban Linx includes one of the best verses and production that hip-hop world has heard. This is also one of the few albums, that has no weak tracks, which is nowadays an rare thing. CLASSIC, that every real rap listener should own.
B00003CXA2|3.0|Did you know that a kindly simpleton was responsible for every cultural phenomenon from the 1960s through the 1980s?  His name was Forrest Gump, and by merit of his below-normal intelligence, there was nothing he couldn't do.  We've all heard Aaron Copland's stirring \\"Fanfare for the Common Man.\\"  Well, this movie could have just as well been entitled \\"Fanfare the Sub-Mediocre.\\"<br />If you think about it honestly, among serious movies, \\"Forrest Gump\\" is one of the dumbest ever made.  I don't want to give away the plot to the uninitiated, so I will limit myself to one fr'instance.  Imagine a beautiful, intelligent woman singing folksongs nude in front of a hundred rowdy, drunken men.  Now imagine this sensitive artist's heart breaking because no one is listening to her music.  That scene in a nutshell captures the mentality of the film; it is one of a hundred scenes very much like it.<br />Quite simply, \\"Forrest Gump\\" is two hours of non-stop tugging at the viewer's  heartstrings.  Like the comedy that throws non-stop jokes at the viewer without any meaningful cohesion, it stops working after a while.<br />Now to give the devil his due: you will enjoy this movie in spite of how dumb it is.  Three stars.  It's fun.  Gump is a sympathetic character whom you will want to see succeed.  The film is fairly funny. The movie REALLY gets carried away, however, when this boob's achievement level goes through the roof.  The viewer is left scratching his head in bewilderment. Which brings up an interesting point: what is the point of this movie?  Plain and simple - it is to exalt the superiority of the lowly over the mighty.  I've spoken with several people who find that very inspiring.  I don't.<br />This is NOT one of the best movies ever.  It's not even particularly good.  That movies like this and \\"Titanic\\" win the Best Film award on Oscar night only goes to show how ridiculous the Academy Awards really are.  Still, it's not a bad way of spending an evening, even if just tobe able to perfect your dead-on impression of the lame-brained main character.  (Mine is quite good.)  However, if you're going to spend your time watching something, why not watch something better?
B000002MFE|5.0|This is a great live acoustic set from Eric Clapton!!! Includes live acoustic versions of:Layla,Tears In Heaven,Rollin'&amp; Tumblin',Before You Accuse Me,Walkin'Blues and many more!!!14 great tracks in all!!! Two thumbs up!!! Five stars!!! A+

B00005S770|4.0|Greetings poetry lovers,<br />It is amazing that this album is not readily available, when far less albums from the era are easily found. This album is a true Rock classic. It takes the power of Deep Purple and blends it with the endless stream of metal mythology from Ronnie James Dio.  One warning, if you don't like Ronnie James Dio (and there are those who really don't) then you won't like this. If you do like Dio, this is one of the best line-ups he ever worked with.  The late Cozy Powell (Jeff Beck, WhiteSnake, Michael Schenker Group, etc.) provides great percussion on this album.  Jimmy Bain does a fine job on bass as does keyboard player Mickey Lee Soule.  <br />Many guitar/keyboard sections are reminiscent of the great moments between Ritchie Blackmore and Jon Lord on Deep Purple's Fireball and Who Do We Think We Are.  Not only is this album far more progressive than the first Rainbow release, the sound engineering is superior, as well.  In fact, the recording quality of this album was as good as it got back then and was only surpassed with the next wave of metal artists such as Ozzy's solo project and Def Leppard (great bottom, clean highs). <br />I had the pleasure of watching his band evolve, having seen three versions of Rainbow live, including the Rainbow Rising tour. It was by far the best of the tours, almost epic in proportion.  They had a great stage backdrop of the first album cover (the Fender Stratocaster made to look like a castle) and - as they went into Stargazer - it was replaced by an even larger backdrop of the Rainbow Rising album cover. Along with Ritchie Blackmore's intense theatrical stage presence, the stage set, fog, lights and all made quite an impression.  <br />Later versions of Rainbow tended more towards commercial rock - and indeed they had commercial success with that approach (Since You've Been Gone, I Surrender, etc.).  I understand that it was Ritchie's decision to move towards commercialism that led to the demise of this version of Rainbow.  However, I always think of this line-up when I think of Ritchie Blackmore's Rainbow.<br />So, if you like Deep Purple and Dio, you can't go wrong with this album (if you can find it)!<br />Another review from your friendly neighborhood Dr. Marcus Narley, M.D.
B000002G87|5.0|This is a classic album(CD)!!! Eric Clapton and Duane Allman rock!!! Contains the classic tracks:Layla,Bell Bottom Blues,Tell The Truth,Key To The Highway,Little Wing,Anyday,and I Looked Away!!! The other songs are great too!!! A treat from start to finish!!! Two thumbs up!!! Five stars!!! A+
B00005R2M3|5.0|Shakira's \\"Laundry Service\\" was definitely a breath of fresh air! If you like originality, you should definitely buy it! I totally love how she uses her voice! My only problem with the CD is that it is not as good as the previous ones in Spanish, especially my favourite \\"Dnde estn los ladrones\\" (the CD). On the CD, my favourites are definitely: Suerte/Whenever Wherever and Te dejo Madrid. I also like how she incooperated tango in \\"Objection\\". I'll admit that with the exception of \\"Whenever Wherever\\" that some of the lyrics in the English songs would sound a bit \\"clumsy\\" to a native English speaker. I guess some people would get turned off by the \\"strange\\" English lyrics. But nevertheless, Shakira's first attempt at a CD with English songs was extremely good and I admire her courage. I'll recommend the CD to anyone!
B00007AJGH|5.0|This 2 DVD set is awesome!!! You get both full frame and widescreen versions of the movie!!! And this baby is loaded with extras!!! The ultimate version of &quot;Who Framed Roger Rabbit&quot;!!! Two thumbs up!!! Five stars!!! A+
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I was thrilled to see Firefly released on DVD.  My wife and I, who rarely agree on anything,  both enjoyed this gem of a show and were very upset when it was cancelled.  The episodes are immensely engaging and you find yourself pulled in with the crew of the Serenity as they attempt to make their way in a future that contains eerie echos of the past.<br />A soulful existential captain, a strong and silent female ex-soldier, a broken damsel in distress and her brilliant protective brother, a greedy thug with a gun fetish, a stunning courtesan, a girl who can fix anything and is so wholesome it hurts, a preacher who dabbled in non-religious things in a previous life, a wise-cracking pilot, this show has it all.<br />The DVD comes with tons of extra goodies like un-aired episodes, behind the scenes interviews with the actors and creator Joss Whedon.  Even the actors knew this show was something special.<br />Buy this one.   You won't regret it.
B000002UJQ|3.0|When I bought this album I didn't know what to expect. I approached it with an open mind and an open heart, hoping to find a great album to add to my collection. Even though there are some amazing songs on this, it doesn't live to the hype. You know a great album the first time you hear it. It completely takes over your subconcious, making you go back again and agian. OK computer doesnt do it. Yeah, you may go back to Paranoid Android, Karma Police, and Subterranean Homesick Alien, but the album drags at points. Yorke's vocals become somewhat of a bother to the ears at points in songs, making you wish he would let up on the falsetto. This album is NOT complete. The reason it was so popular was that it was released in the middle of the &quot;boyband&quot; era. Most critics were starving for a rock savior and were quick to give credit to something new. If people were not so quick to jump on the bandwagon, this album would deserve its &quot;classic&quot; status
020530902X|5.0|And that's what makes it special. The book steps beyond rules for writing and suggests to us all that life with rules and clarity is better than a life without them. Even Professor Strunk's comment that rules can be broken in capable hands leaves one wondering exactly whose hands he had in mind.<br />So read it for rules about writing if you will, but look beyond for rules about the clarity of life to discover what so many find appealing about this book.
B00005OAIE|4.0|I will be short. A young guy who writes his own music, plays the guitar soulfully and has the voice of an (I admit hoarse) angel, deserves nothing but respect. I'm happy to hear some real, ment music with all it's shortcomings and cliche's. I will wait for more and am sure that he will deliver. And all of you who are talking about Dave Matthews: I can't hear any resemblence in their voices.
B00005JKEZ|5.0|The Adventures of Robin Hood Special Edition really shows you how great DVDs can be if the movie studios take the time and care to do them right.  Here we have a 65 year old movie, and it gets better treatment on DVD than most new releases.<br />This was the movie that would really make Errol Flynn the star and the quintessential swashbuckler of all time.  Flynn plays Robin Hood, fighting the oppressive Normans and helping the poor Saxons.<br />The grerat cast includes Claude Rains as evil prince John, BAsil Rathbone as the Sir Guy of Gisbourne, Alan Hale Sr. as Little John, and Olivia De Haviland as Maid Marian.  Many other great character actors are there too.<br />An exciting, colorful movie done in vivid and gorgeous technicolor which gets a great transfer on DVD.  Flawless audio and video.  This alone would make it great but Warner Home video has spared nothing to make a great DVD.<br />This two disc set is loaded with special features.  There's a commentary track by film historian Rudy Behlmer with great annecdotes about the movie.<br />Critic Leonard Maltin gives us a grear &quot;Warner Bros. Night at the Movies&quot;.  You see the movie just as you would had you gone to the theatre back in the 1930's with a newsreel, musical short, trailers, cartoon, and then, of course the feature film.  This is a fantastic touch.<br />There's a brand new documetary made in 2003 about the making of the movie and including interviews with surviving members of the crew.<br />There are a couple of Robin Hood related warner Bros, cartoons starring Bugs Bunny and DAffy Duck.<br />There's a great WArner Bros blooper reel which was an annual thing Warner Bros. put together.  Lots of great outtakes from some old classic movies including Robin Hood.  Great on-going gag of Basil Rathbone trying on different helmets for his role as Sir Guy.<br />A Hisotry of Robin Hood on-screen featurette...<br />A collection of Trailers from Flynn's other movies.<br />And there's a lot more.  i cannot give this a higher recommendation.  Hopefully other classics will receive such treatment on DVD.nnot give this a higher recommendation.  Hopefully other classics will receive such treatment on DVD.
B000002NHN|5.0|I just wanted to add my bit to the voluminous reviews of this compilation.  It is essential.  With this work McKennitt stands, perhaps, at the absolute apex of modern Celtic music.  An album that is compelling and enjoyable even when played many, MANY times. A case where, IMO, Amazon should not put the reviewer's limit at 5 stars!
B00005RHGL|5.0|The tale of the Gunfight at the OK Corral has been told numerous times but never better than in Tombstone.  Kurt Russell is Wyatt Earp who has come to Tombstone, not to be a lawman, but to open a business with his two brothers Virgil and Morgan played by Sam Elliot and Bill Paxton.<br />They meet their old Friend, Doc Holiday in town, played by Val Kilmer in one of his best roles.  Doc is an alcoholic and suffers from TB.<br />AS much as they want to live in peace, Tombstone is lawless and a local gang called the Cowboys, led by Powers Boothe, rules the town.  The Earps take over as sheriff and deputies, eventually leading to the shootout at the OK Corral.<br />While factually more true than previous attempts, it still does take some liberty with the truth.  Still, the performances from everyone are fantastic.<br />The EArps certianly are not glamourized as they may have been in older westerns.<br />This special editions includes a longer cut of the movie and restores some nice scenes.  There are three makiing of features, and other Tombstone info.  The only bad thing is the very dull commentary track by Director George Cosmatos.<br />All in all a great movie.
B0000024IE|5.0|Every so often, a piece of music comes along that defines a genre. The Beatles did it with Rock with their masterpeice Sgt. Peppers, Nirvana deifned grunge with Nevermind, and Public Enemy did it with Fear of a Black Planet.<BR>Whether it be Chuck D's lyrical rhetoric or Flavor Flav's chiming in, this album sets it off with a vengence. 911 is a joke is a rap anthem that still rings true today, and on Burn Hollywood Burn, a young Ice Cube can be heard lighting it up with the Bomb Squad. <BR>If you don't own this album, get it. If you do have it, listen to it, and remember...Fight the Power!
0694003611|5.0|I have been reading to my son since he was a newborn and like other viewers it wasn't obvious to me why he would like this book. He is now 9 months and grins like crazy when he sees the first page and protests if i do not reread the book to him. Saying goodnight to multiple objects through a rhyme is soothing while a brightly lit colorful room grows dimmer and dimmer.Also the bright pages are interlaced with back and white pages with simpler pictures which works well in terms of keeping the pace right and not over stimulating him as a bedtime story.<BR>I did a lot of research in picking his first board bks and he thoroughly enjoys all of them. Highly Recommended!<BR>1. Goodnight Moon (bed time)<BR>2. The Big Red Barn (bed time)<BR>3. The Very Hungry Caterpillar<BR>4. The Runaway Bunny<BR>5. Pat the Bunny (not exactly a board book)

B0000028VT|5.0|This is one of my favorite Mariah Carey albums because it's lush in its arrangements, and has some excellent ballads. There's a few uptempo songs, like the #1 single \\"Dreamlover\\", \\"I've Been Thinking About You\\" and \\"Now That I Know\\". The rest of the songs are nice ballads, including the #1 inspirational song \\"Hero\\". She does gospel on the soulful \\"Anytime You Need A Friend\\", which was a mild hit as well. The title track is really nice ballad, but my favorite is the closing \\"All I've Ever Wanted\\", which is a strong love song. I have the version of this cd with the bside \\"Everything Fades Away\\", which is on the \\"Hero\\" single I believe. Other highlights include \\"Never Forget You\\" and \\"Without You\\". Overall a really nice album, start to finish.
B0000507PC|4.0|John Irving himself wrote the screenplay for Cider House Rules, so we can't blame clueless scriptwriters for the lack of depth in this film adaptation of the wonderful saga-like book. The issues of incest and abortion, which are such powerful central themes in the book, are prettily glossed over in the movie.<BR>In spite of these omissions, Cider House Rules still feels like an elegiac blessing of forgiveness for Man's sins and foibles. There's a sweetness and innocence behind most of the characters that makes them look at the world's evils with kindhearted compassion. The book made me think I'd actually like the author, if I ever met him, something none of his other books has achieved; I'm glad I read it before seeing the movie.
0156027321|3.0|The plot of the Life of Pi has much potential for an exciting novel. Unfortunately, it is a laborious read, except for portions where the author just writes the story without any tangents and unnecessary stream of consciousness episodes that serve no purpose. There is too much telling of irrelevant details and thoughts and too little showing the reader entertaining action. The action that does occur in the book is intriguing--the ship sinking, Pi and some animals in the lifeboat, their subsequent interactions, and his quest for survival. There is a plethora of opportunity here to better captivate the reader, but the writer attempts to stimulate us with droll talk of religion and mundane information.<br />The book ends with attempts at profundities but just left me wondering what it was all about. I think I have a decent sense for spiritually significant writing, but I did not catch any meaningful insights from this book. Maybe I missed it.<br />I think there are some real inconsistencies with the main character Pi. I know this is a story of a child being told by the child as an adult, but Pi is like a small child in one scene and next thing you know he is lecturing about religious ideas. He is familiar with the nature of animals from growing up in a zoo, but then he weeps over a fish he has to kill to eat.<br />The interaction with the tiger and the other animals was entertaining and imaginative and may make the book worth reading--there just isn't enough of it and it tends to become filled with minutia rather than action.<br />The high expectations generated by the introductory chapters never came full circle.<br />You might enjoy this book, but it is one I was disappointed with throughout as my expectations were let down.
0385504209|1.0|I'm a 63-year-old guy whose mind probably isn't as sharp as it used to be. I am of average (at best) intelligence. I graduated from an average small public college with A's and B's in my major/minor (journalism/English), the rest of the grades I'm not too proud of.<br />That said, without -- I swear, promise -- even going to the various Da Vinci Code (DVC)-related websites, i.e., w/o being tipped off there even was a code, I IMMEDIATELY spotted the code on the jacket and wrote it out, in order. I IMMEDIATELY rearranged and understood the \\"Fibonacci number sequence\\" before author Brown explained it, and then, on page 298, I IMMEDIATELY read the script (it's only English backwards, for heaven's sake) that none of the \\"brainy stars\\" in the book could figure out for several pages.<br />I mean, c'mon. At best this is Clancy with culture. Is it a page-turner? Sure -- I just can't wait to see how much more ridiculous it can get as far as plot goes.<br />I'm just over halfway through DVC and am shaking my head.  It's nothing more than a few cute, clever alphanumeric tricks that Brown builds stories around, linking them rather weakly, i.e., trying too hard, and it's SO obvious.  Half-way through, the characters in the story have been to hell in a hand basket and back in the span of, oh, 6 to 9 hours of night-time. They are sleep- and food- deprived and yet are as bright-eyed and bushy-tailed as well-fed squirrels eyeing a dog. Totally coherent. Yeah, right.<br />Oh I'm learning neat things about the Louvre and the streets of Paris, all of which I've never seen. I'm learning about the factual factions of the Catholic faith/church, that Da Vince was a homosexual, biblical references, that Mary M. was really cool (and thus hidden) and other interesting stuff, but other than that, THIS BOOK -- not just the story of Christianity -- is really the \\"greatest story ever SOLD\\" (to borrow a quote from the book).<br />An occasionally interesting, implausible laugher. I'm really hugely disappointed, but I'll finish it out. Boy, has the English-speaking public ever been duped!disappointed, but I'll finish it out. Boy, has the English-speaking public ever been duped!

B0000VAFO0|4.0|Many have voiced their opinions of this film.  I was hesistant to see this in theatres mainly because of them and I am (in a way) angry I listened to them.  Namely because this film would have been so cool to see on the big screen.  Visually, it's a feast of inspiration and a story that is literally told from a visual standpoint as well as a literal standpoint.  Bearing in mind the director has taken an age old concept and shaken it up a bit.<br />The premise is pretty simple, Vampires and Werewolves are at war with each other based on age old principles carried down from their ancestors.  One side believes one thing, the other side believes another.  All the while, they fight for something neither side really knows what or &quot;who&quot; they're fighting for.  This premise is sort of an analogy based upon our religious natures as humans.  For example, we have one side of humanity that says there is &quot;a god&quot; and one side that says there's just &quot;God,&quot; and the possiblity that neither side is right and that God simply is just folklore.  What we see in &quot;Underworld&quot; is a story of the persecution and the revelation of what real truth is.  The price you pay for that truth and possibilites of retribution.  Politics smear the facts, lies are told over centuries of war and doubt and Lycans are hunted, while Vampyre are thwarted.  Sounds familiar with what is going on our world I am afraid.  The problem is most people don't see things like that through a movie like this.  Most just see a movie like this as a simple action flick with really cool special effects.  This story is so much more than that.<br />Keep in mind when watching this film that the story is simply not just about Vampyre and Lycans but an analogy of things to come in our own world.  Much of this story shows how truth is often betrayed and manipulated over the cost of stepping out of the boundaries to a brave new world.  If you go into this movie thinking the female vampire and the male lycan are &quot;in love&quot; or have a steamy romance, you're far from the mark of this movie.  Someone wrote once this movie was a modern day &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot; told from a Vampire/Werewolf perspective-WRONG AGAIN!  This movie has none of that!  Watch this movie and just open your mind to something different and beautiful and read into it as much as you can.  There's more truth to this story than what appears.the male lycan are &quot;in love&quot; or have a steamy romance, you're far from the mark of this movie.

B0000AQS0F|3.0|Watching these DVD's changed my mind about this cancelled series.  I still don't like the metally-damaged sister -- she is just annoying.  And the Preacher doesn't get to do much in any of the episodes.  But the writing is smart and often successfully witty.  Many of the central characters are memorable.  When one considers how bad the last couple of Star Trek series have been, it is a shame Firefly was cancelled so quickly.
B00005QFE5|5.0|The Road Home is a movie about a very standard and simple love on the first site story. The beauty is in the great acting and the spirit that comes out of the actors.<br />I liked a lot to watch how people in such villages live and how they dress and the movie gave attention to many daily events of those people.<br />Again, the acting is gorgeous, but the values that the movie is showing is great also and the strong bounds in the family is there in the movie and you can see how much the love and respect of a sun would make him do to meet his mothers wishes and how grateful student can be to a teacher gave his life to them.<br />Another point that I liked in the movie is how the director use color. In the current events, you will see black and white scenes and when flashbacks start the colors will come a life. The old days are better and there was the real life for the characters of this movie not the current days, except for the day the sun took his father's place in the school and start teaching the students of the village.<br />Great movie that I would love to watch again and again.
B0000AZJXQ|5.0|I disagree with the reviews which compare this album unfavorably with Mer de Noms. That was a great album, but Thirteenth Step shows Maynard and friends growing and developing musically, rather than repeating the same old stuff, as many artists do. A Perfect Circle stands head and shoulders above most rock acts today, and I believe that The Thirteenth Step represents the best album of 2003. It is moody, atmospheric, intelligent, and richly textured lyrically and instrumentally. It is not fully appreciated on the first listening, but rapidly becomes addictive with repeated listenings (I find myself playing it more than Mer de Noms, which I love). And it is packed with great songs: Weak and Powerless, The Noose, Blue, and The Outsider are all fantastic. A particular favorite of mine is the extraordinary \\"Pet\\": clearly a 9/11 influenced song in which the Government is represented as a smothering, overprotective parent. My one disappointment is that this album receives so little radio airplay. Maynard mentioned during the Cedar Rapids concert that The Outsider had been released as a single, but the only song we ever hear in our market is Weak and Powerless. It is a testament to the short-sightedness and lack of imagination of radio programmers that tired old \\"big hair\\" acts from the eighty's receive constant airplay, while beautiful, original, new music like this is seldom heard.
031286504X|5.0|I am Legend by Richard Mathenson stands out in the world of horror writing. While the story is only a novella, taking up roughly the first half of the book, I am Legend contains a huge amount of detail. It tells the story of a man who believes he is the last human left on a planet ravaged by vampires. Methodical in his methods, every day he hunts vampires in his neighborhood and gathers supplies, constantly searching for signs of life and encountering people he used to know in his former life, before they were transformed into vampires.<br />I am Legend is a story that has a conclusive ending but still leaves you wanting more, showing that Matheson is truly a master horror writer.<br />In addition to I am Legend, the book also contains short stories that Matheson has written. While not nearly the same caliber as Legend, these stories are both entertaining and well written.<br />This book is one of the finest horror collections I have read since HP Lovecraft, and in a genre filled with mediocre work it stands out as a shining example of how good horror can be.
B000089RVR|1.0|Ah good to see that the points I made in my first three posts on this album are born out. Still the posts flood in for this very ordinary and bland album that Dido has delivered. <br />As I stated, which some people rebuked...but have a read you people - its either a two line post saying that it's the \\"bestest CD in the history of CDs, ever in the history of CDs, Dido is fabby\\" (which I read as - \\"Ive not heard many CDs and I'm not a real music fan, so this is my best so far in my collection of three CDs\\"), or a long post outlining each song giving each one 10/10 - yawn. Just give the album 11/10 and say its better than The Beatles and get it over with!<br />I see Dido is up for a grammy or two, this again backs my case on what blanderama it really is. Lets stop a second and see who won grammys last time. Well its an exciting lineup (sarcasm), in a world producing genuinely exciting music, who could it have been; The Strokes, White Stripes, Black Motorcycle Rebel Club, The Libertines, Tori Amos, Killing Joke, Justin Sullivan......no the line up included ;<br />Sheryl Crow, Bruce Springsteen, Tony Bennett, Carlos Santana, B.B. King, Norah Jones,Chaka Khan, Faith Hill, Johnny Cash, Dixie Chicks , Clinch Mountain Boys , Lee &quot;Scratch&quot; Perry.<br />Not so much The Fast And The Furious, more like The Pensioners And The Bland. Let me check again, it is the 21st Century isn't it, not the 19th? <br />In this company  Dido should win big for her album. Bland - check, All One Pace, Don't Upset Grandma - check, Kitchen Sink Drama Lyrics - check, Over 40s Feel - check. Is this what we need in 2004, true there has always been a market for ordinary music through the years, but don't we need a little bit of excitement? Also if I read the word \\"sophmore\\" in one more reviewers posts for her and Michelle Branch and all the other ordinary music like this, I'll yell! It's as predictable as the music itself. Oh and David Anderson, the Pullizer is on its way, Rolling Stone shouldbe contacting you with a job offer any time.<br />Of course its your right to like this album, I mean there are many out there who worship Barry Manilow. But don't you want some originality in your life? If you put this on and your grandma puts her teeth back in to sing along, as she will, because its like the \\"old days\\", you got some reflecting to do!
B0000AZJXQ|5.0|Now that the year has come to it's end, I can honestly say that Thirteenth Step, the lastest release from A Perfect Circle was the best album of the year. Everything from the skilled songwriting, to the passion in MJK's voice just makes this the perfect album for anyone into hard rock, heavy metal, or anywhere between the two.
B00006CXXU|5.0|This CD is absolutely one of the best I have heard in a while. A huge fan of R&B, I dare to compare the soulful vocals of Christina on this Album to Whitney and Mariah with the flavor of Alicia Keys(beside the fact Alicia is on here). With the right balance of balads and pop, she has simply created a wonderful album. Whether your looking for a night out in the French Quarter and need that beat to get hyped, or simply want to relax with her inspirational melodies, she's got u covered. Words cannot express what a joy it is to listen to her voice, do yourself a favor and buy this album. Every song is great.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Like some of the other reviewers, I thought this show was going to be a little silly and cheesy.  I didn't even watch it when Fox briefly aired it.  Of course, that's not surprising since Fox decided that Friday at 8 or 9 pm (I can't remember which) would be the best time to launch the series (somehow I don't think the prime demographic for this show is home watching TV on Friday nights!)<br />Enough complaining about Fox, I'm just bitter because there won't be a second season.  Which is a real shame because this is a fun show.  I'm assuming you have a passing interest in Sci Fi or you wouldn't even be considering this series, and given that interest I think you'll really like this show.<br />The characters are varied with each of them having a significant role.  There are some stereotypical characters - the Captain for instance, but that's not necessarily a bad thing.  There's a certain comfort in watching the outwardly surly and mercenary Captain stick by his honor and show that he really cares about his crew.<br />The creators didn't cut any corners either.  The special effects are great and probably not too cheap (another reason Fox probably cancelled it).<br />The other thing great about this set is that the shows are formatted for widescreen (it looks great on a 16:9 TV).<br />So give this one a chance - reasonably priced and well worth your time.
B00008J2DQ|1.0|The king of all constipated-sounding vocalists, Sully, comes back and fronts his band, Godsmack, for another corporate piece of trash. Godsmack keeps performing the same song album after album. Even when they attempt to \\"stray\\" away from their weak heaviness, they STILL play the same song as \\"Serenity\\" sounds EXACTLY like \\"Voodoo.\\" Voodoo Boodoo, whatever. So fans, please tell me what the difference of every song is. Oh nevermind, you're all too tonedeaf to know. My best advice for someone who happens to go through the trauma of listening to this, is to just simply shove your fists in your ears. For the true fans of theirs, read these following words carefully....THEY ARE DONE AFTER THEIR NEXT ALBUM...now kiss me :o
B000002B2T|5.0|The true testament to a good musician is how versatile one is. This album demonstrates how good each member of this band really is. Any doubters, listen to November Hotel, quite simply one of the greatest pieces of music in rock history.  This album, a long time ago when I bought it inspired me to learn to play music. There are few albums that are as good from beginning to end that are so downright enjoyable on so many fronts.  Whether you like the voice, the music, the atmosphere, you will definitely find something worthwhile.  Buy this album.
B0000DD7NL|5.0|Alicia Keyes, Continues to deliver!!!    She is an amazing musician, an unbelieveable performer, and If you had any doubts in her before... this album will show you just how good she really is!

B0000AM6K2|5.0|This album is by far one of 2003's best.  Don Mcleese [see above Amazon editorial review] either did not listen to the album or is too busy jamming to Clay Aiken to understand fresh talent when he hears it.  Unlike Amazon, Rolling Stone and the Onion are heralding Rouse as one of the best &quot;up and coming&quot; talents.  The lyrics on the album are profound.  The tone is subtly intense.  The sound mixes great acoustic guitar with cool effects--e.g., flute, vibes, hammond b3--to give a &quot;retro&quot; feel that still sounds cool &quot;3 decades later.&quot;  Now, logoff Amazon.com and go buy the album from a local independent business person in your community so that we can put the likes of uninformed, out-of-touch big business music editors back out on the street and into small music scenes where real music is made.
B00006879E|4.0|When I first purchased this CD, I was most excited about their two hit songs, Harder to Breathe and This Love.  A full listen to the record reveals a band struggling to find their true sound.  With harder rock melodies, like Harder to Breathe and This Love, and jazzy alternative beats, a la Sunday Morning and Secret, the band succeeds in fitting into it's mainstream image with a sound it can call it's own.  Unfortunately, they also throw in a little too much *NSYNC into others, such as Shiver, Through with You, and Coming Home.  The harmonized vocals are too much of a reminder of the Boy band era music has so recently emerged from and stray from the sound the band created so well in other tracks.  Lead singer Adam Levin should stick with the alternative sound and leave the falsetto to Justin Timberlake.  The CD has potential and, for its price (I got it for $8.00) it's a great CD, but the unfulfilled potential of some songs is a disappointment.

0375432302|3.0|Maybe the plot was ruined for me by my having played the computer game Gabriel Knight 3 a couple of years ago.  It contains the exact same conspiracy theory, with Mary Magdalene and the Templars and the Merovingians and subtle hints in artwork.  Everything - just from a slightly different angle.  Frankly, I think the game made a more complex and satisfying mystery out of the same research.  The Da Vinci Code was an entertaining read but like some other people here, I found it annoying when the characters displayed extreme stupidity in order to stretch out the plot for longer.  And you just know this novel is destined for Hollywood when you find product placement ads for SmartCar in it. (Have you no shame, Mr. Brown?)  It's not a terrible book, but I was expecting more meat here.
B000056K04|5.0|This album, while others have argued otherwise, is so good you have to hear it for yourself. While I bought this CD for the prime tracks such as: \\"Everyday\\", \\"I Did It\\", and of course \\"Space Between\\", i realized that this CD has soul. Every song is it's own little masterpiece; the favorite of mine being \\"So Right\\". This CD evokes pure emotion, and it is truly an essential CD.
B000002UJQ|5.0|I consider this album to be one of the most important pieces of my music collection. \\"Let Down\\" is one of the most amazing songs ever written. Radiohead is without a doubt the greatest band to exist in a long time...
0380789035|3.0|For me Neil Gaiman lost his steam after Neverwhere.  I read all his sandman comics and looked forward to his novels, but this particular one didn't amaze me.  Perhaps I was expecting too much.  Mr. Gaiman displays his talent for colorful imagery all throughout the story, but it does little to MOVE the story.  The book read like a series of short tales, and maybe he should've published it that way.<br />If you never read Neil Gaiman before, I'd recommend Neverwhere before purchasing this title.  That one has a more solid story and showcases Neil Gaiman's wonderful sense of humor.

B000056N8X|3.0|When Highlander:Endgame came out, I was out of the country, and did not find out about it until I went back to the USA and my brother's review of the movie. Honestly, I was exhilarated at the though of Connor and Duncan together on the bigscreen. When my brother told me Connor \\"died\\" and not to watch it, I was in shock. Connor Macleod, the ONE, killed off. I decided never to watch such \\"blasphemy\\" in my life.<br />As a Highlander fan, and a traditionalist (in true literary fashion, a plot must always be consistent)I was also a fan of the series, always considering it as a PREQUEL to Highlander #1. Duncan was prety cool in his own way, even though it was evident he was a shadow of Connor (one can see alot of Connor in him). Could be Duncan wanted to imitate his idol and mentor, or Paul adopted an established charcter (Connor) and did his best to make it as Duncan as possible. <br />To make this review brief, Highlander:Endgame was good in the sense it had great fight scenes & effects. It is worth the three stars I gave, and even a non-Highlander fan would enjoy the movie, but for story line and logic in the true Highlander plot, it butchered the whole premise. Why?<br />* Highlander #1 evidently takes place during the Gathering. Kastagir (Connor's Arab/African friend) mentions that fact while talking with Connor on the bridge. Kurgan mentions it too.<br />* Connor and Kurgan are the last two remaining. Just look at the Church sequence between Connor and Kurgan (\\"Its only us two now, Highlander!).<br />* Highlander #1 evidently shows that Connor was sort of predestined to win the prize, a special Immortal. Ramirez knew that and traveled continents to find him and prepare him, and Kurgan wanted his head and traveled from Russia to get it. (Connor never knew he was Immortal). Ramirez and Kurgan knew about Connor, even when they knew he was not yet an Immortal. Highlander #2 was supposed to explain that detail.<br />* Connor has special powers at the end (reading minds,takling with spirits, i.e. Ramirez) after obtaining Kurgan's quickening.<br />Endgame ignore these concepts that are so EVIDENT. Plot wise, it should have been Connor who had to finish Kell off, even though he became a cameo character and Duncan the star. There are many ways to pass the torch to Duncan without killing off Connor, so long that Endgame remained a prequel to Highlander #1. Since the producers made it a continuation of the Series (which, despite being a good show and gave life to the Highlander mystique and lore, was in many ways a deviation of Highlander #1), the plot of Endgame went the way it did. The series de facto ignores Highlander #1, (that Connor Macleod in the One).<br />Basically, for the producers, Highlander #1 (ignoring #2 &3) is the prequel, the series continues it, and Endgame ends it (at least for Connor). Modern mass minds may be fickle, but literature and literary element are premanent and unchangeable. They forget that of course. Based on this last note, Connor, Kastagir, and Kurgan had to be the stupidest Immortals ever. Believing they were ACTUALLY in the Gathering. What chumps<br />I saw the movie eventually, mustered the courage, but not enough to see Connor's death (I had to walk out of the house and have my wife call me when it was over. I did not even hear what went on mych less atch it). Overall, great fight scenes and graphics,and the cheap trill of watching any Highlander's fantasy of seeing Connor and Duncan together on the big screen... The outcome was not what anyone expected and should not have happened. There can be only one and that is Connor.

B00013F35I|3.0|If you do not want to go through the trouble connected with returning the defective 2nd disc, try this first. I've got a Pioneer player and the trick works always, so chances are it might work with other brands too. <br />Check it out: 1. Wait until the background music ends (like 10 secs) 2. Keep 'Play' pressed until the player sort of 'reloads' the dvd (like 10 secs again)and activates the screensaver 3. Press 'Play'and now your player should load track 1 of the concert. 4. To view the bonus materials, just access them via the remote control's 'Search Mode':<br />Title 1: The Encores<BR>Title 2: 'The Night of the Living Boss'<BR>Title 3: FBI Warning<BR>Title 4: 'Drop The Needle and Play'<br />The only 'features' (if you can even call them that) you cannot access is the 'Setlist' and 'Other DVDS' - two totally unimportant features, anyway. You can set the Audio Options (Dolby/PCM) directely via the control's 'Audio' button.<br />I have found this to be a completely satisfying solution for myself which saves me the inconvenience of returning the defective disc, etc. Works for me. <br />I have not yet had time to watch the entire show but I treated myself to a few of the songs - I can only repeat what so many others have stated: the production quality of the concert is really a shame - it can't compete with the 'Live in NYC' dvd. The sound is much better on the NYC dvd, as is the direction, but I can easily live with that. It's a great show. And for the price? It's a good buy nonetheless.

(hey it's even got lee van cleef)<BR>the plot/movie/soundtrack/special effects was slightly ahead of it's time; a former lt. turned criminal is forced to resucue the president of us within 24 hours etc.etc.etc. many movies tried to imitate escape's concept (I.E.gale ann turd's NO ESCAPE, FORTRESS, and the god awful roger corman's NEW CRIME CITY.) Russell proved to be more of a versatile actor than  the over hyped schwartzenegger<BR>but then again that's not saying anything new. as for the DVD S.E. it's packed with bonuses, a cool mini comicbook, the hilarious commentary (albiet an old one) from carpenter and russell,photo gallery and the 15 minute bank robbery scene/ opener. it made alot of sense to omit that scene from the original movie, but it was cool to finally see what escape fans like me have missed since 1981. HUZZAHHH! the perfect companion for this dvd would be the special soundtrack release from silva records. (the bank robbery theme is \\"off the hook\\") there's a part in the movie that still sends a chill in my spine when a radical hijacker crashes a plane near the world trade center!!<BR>talk about irony. like i said..escape from ny was way ahead of it's time. and for you snake fans who can't get enough, read the comic series from hurricane press and lookout for the upcoming videogame series by namco not to mention an upcomind anime from the creators of ghost in the shell is now in the works.<br />SNAKE IS BACK!!!
0385507755|5.0|A Million Little Pieces is absolutely one of the best books I've ever read. And that says a lot; It keeps company in my bookcase with Mark Twain, Larry McMurtry, Wally Lamb, Hemingway, Stegner, Pirsig...the list goes on. <br />This book is real. It's honest. How courageous of Mr. Frey to not only stand up and face himself and his addictions, but to TELL his story to the world. To tell the truth about his life and what he went through and what he put his family through. <br />You have seen some mixed reviews, no doubt. But we all have our own opinions. So form your own. Don't let a nasty review from a jealous, whiny former addict be the reason you don't read this book. Don't cheat yourself. The book is amazing and even if you don't agree with everything in it (we seldom do) you are certain to take something away from it. Buy the book, read the book, keep the book on your shelf. You'll be sure to pick it up again and again.
B00005JMTN|5.0|My one fear with this movie is that it will be overlooked...  Beautifully shot and acted, if you let it, this story will take you into a world filled with kindness, family, and fantasy.  I highly suggest this film.. Wonderful. Can not give it a higher rating.
0698119347|5.0|Starts out fairly quickly, which is a good thing in this book. Feels like you are in the rooms next to Alex (The main character)just listening. Lots of details which is what makes it good. The ending is a surprise and is not really what you expect. It is sort of odd the last couple of pages. The adventure is based on a good plot. I really liked the book. I had made a 8 page report on it, but that was for school, and its a spoiler. Well I really recomend the book. Here were my ratings<br />Plot:          ****<BR>Characters:    *****<BR>Setting:       *****<BR>Climax:        *****<BR>Realisticity:  ***1/2<BR>Total:         **********************1/2<BR>Average:       ****1/2<br />Once again I HIGHLY recomend the book, also once your so addicted to it I also recomend Point Blank(the sequel)
B00009TB5G|2.0|Yes, I'm not rating this film high, or Fellowship. I found out only recently about the extended versions. I only saw them in theaters and thought they were awful films. After watching the extended version of Fellowship, I grew to like that one more, but haven't seen the ext. version of The Two Towers, a film I hated in theaters. Call me crazy for writing a review. I felt cheated. If they're so good and so popular, why didn't the studio release the extended versions for a couple of weeks in a handful of theaters? Shame on them.  The Audience IS WATCHING!
B00009W0U4|4.0|I went to see this film with a certain amount of trepadition and prejudice, thinking I would hate it just because of all the hype that I'd heard beforehand. I'd seen BAISE-MOI a few years before and thought it was just junk, so i kind of expected the same here. I was quite surprised to find that I actually enjoyed the film. It starts off pretty intensely, with twirling cameras following two guys as they run through a gay bar trying to find someone.  What follows is one of the most vicious depictions of a beating I've ever come across in a film.  Initially it comes across as some sort of homophobic attack, but as the film unspools and gives us the backstory MEMENTO-style, you find out what lead to the attack. From then on, the intensity gets upped as you find out what lead to the attack.  You find out later that the two guys who killed the dude in the gay bar did so out of revenge.  There's a scene where Monica Bellucci gets raped for a solid ten minutes. It gets pretty hard to watch, but honestly, I expected worse and found the opening scene much more shocking.  I disagree, however, with the people who found the film to be an exercise in exploitation.  I found the back story to be quite open-ended and left a lot of room for interpretation.  What was really strange is that the movie had me feeling amped up at the beginning and soothed and calm by the end of it.  Quite the reverse of what I expected. It left a lot of questions hanging too: was it just Bellucci's dream? Were the two guys justified for killing the man in the gay bar? Is revenge as senseless as the criminal act that motivates it? etc.  Having been the victim of a car-jacking once, I do understand the motivation for revenge. One of the hardest questions in life is how do you get revenge without being sucked into the world of the criminals who push you into it, and ultimately, becoming one of them?  What I also liked is that none of the characters is 'pure'. Marcus is obviously a womanizer and a bit of a loose'cannon, while Bellucci does have an air of the seductress/tease about her. Pierre is a wimp and a coward, but even he is pushed into deviant behaviour. I'd have to see the film again to sort out what it means because it's somewhat emotionally draining and hardly leaves you room to think...which may be the point of the director after all. All in all, a much better film than I expected it to be and certainly well above the works of other 'shock-meister' directors like Larry Clark. It's worth a viewing but it's not for the squeamish.
B000006TRV|5.0|This double-disc masterpiece is undoubtedly Pink Floyd's greatest album. If you can only own one album by this band, make it The Wall! This CD takes listeners into the mind of a madman who is going insane, building a \\"wall\\" around himself. Many of the band's greatest hits (though certainly not all) are contained on this album. I highly recommend this to any true Rock and Roll fan. Over here in Finland, we love Pink Floyd!
B00005JLEU|5.0|From Hayao Miyazaki, comes one of the best anime movies ever made, if not the best.  It was the winner of Best Animated Feature-national board of review, Winner of Golden Bear Award Best picture-52nd Berlin International Film Festival and Winner of Best animated Film-New York Film critics Circle.  It is the highest grossing anime/movie in Japan of all time.<BR>     Chihiro and her parents are moving to a new town, when they take a shortcut and find themselves in a world full of sprits who hate humans and Chihiro parents are turned into pigs!  To save them she must work in the bathhouse under the evil witch who rules the bathhouse.  She is taken on an amazing journey, discovering a wonderland she didn't know could exist and summons her own strength she never knew she had!<BR>        Spirited Away is rich in beautiful animation, a richly done story, breathtaking music and a world that only Hayao Miyazaki could create!  I recommend Spirited Away to anyone, anime fan or not, children and adults.  Spirited Away is not to be missed by anyone.
B000002I2M|5.0|This album has got to be one of a handful of the best albums ever recorded, in any genre, right up there with Born in the USA and The Wall. This is more a blues CD than Rock, in my opinion. Every track is great, but a few stand out as absolute all-time classics: Love Her Madly, L.A. Woman, and Riders on the Storm. The Changeling, King Snake, and Been Down So Long are great, driving Blues songs, and Hyacinth House is a delightful rarity. If you can only own one Doors CD, make it this one!
B00001OH7N|4.0|I've heard this album was Bowie's attempt at heavy metal.  I'm not sure I agree, but the album is definitely one of his heaviest efforts.  This is Bowie's second studio album, & it is strikingly different from his folk-oriented \\"Space Oddity\\".  Bowie excellently employs legendary glam-rock guitarist Mick Ronson for a blusier, heavier, more distrotion-driven guitar sound.<br />\\"The Man Who Sold the World\\" (TMWSTW) couldn't have opened with a better piece than \\"The Width of a Circle\\".  It's a long, segmented song with a variety of tempo changes and it also moves the listener through a plethora of moods.  \\"All the Madmen\\" is a song about, well, madmen.  The eerie wooden whistles add a nice touch of lunacy to the song.  \\"Running Gun Blues\\" is an all-out rocker about a war vet who comes home & embarks on a shooting spree not unlike the DC sniper incident.  \\"She Shook Me Cold\\" is a dark, bluesy ditty with obvious lyrics describing a sexual encounter.  My favorite song on the album is the conclusion, \\"The Supermen\\".  It's a lofty, echoing piece about an apparent race of superhumans that existed before time...It reminds me of short stories from H.P. Lovecraft's Cthulhu Mythos.  The timpani and octave-leaping moans in the background give the song a weird, other-worldly feel.<br />The album cover for TMWSTW is characteristically Bowie, with him sporting a tight fitting, Victorian-era silk dress.  He is holding playing cards while reclining on a sofa.  It's a feminine image giving off a sense of subtle danger.<br />A drawback to TMWSTW is the sometimes muddy production of the album, thanks to Tony Visconti (maybe he's a bass player first, then a producer...).  There are also a few songs like \\"After All\\" & \\"Saviour Machine\\" that I consider rather weak & forgettable.<br />Overall, if you want a change from Bowie's (*powder-puff*) 80's & 90's material, this is an album to invest in.
B000002X2B|5.0|AS mentioned before, the lyrics change during two stanzas (sic?) of \\"Let's Go Together\\" shook me. After not being able to appreciate one of the finest albums ever made for years, and then playing it after receiving my cd, I was SHOCKED at the change of lyrics during this song. <br />I spent many weeks memorizing the lyrics to this album in the 70's. The CD does not include the incredible artwork and lyrics the vinyl had, and it saddens me that kids can not feel this music while reading the poetry that went into it. So go up in the attic (as I did) and dig out the original stuff from the vinyl so that your kids can get the message of this classic album. And correct the original lyrics for them when \\"Let's Go Together\\" comes on. After that, you have only one thing to do with them, in this current era of freedom robbing government: Wave goodbye to Amerika, and say hello to the garden.<br />Hopefully, our babes WILL wander naked through the cities of the universe! Thank you, Paul Kantner, for this masterpiece.
B00005AQF7|5.0|There are NO ( ZERO, ZILCH, NADA, NONE) bad songs on the album. That's saying a lot, too. Every song is nothing short of amazing. With Snoop's smooth silky flow combined with G-Funk provided by Dr. Dre, Daz, and Warren G, and great appearances from Nate Dogg and the rest of the Dogg Pound, this album is just pure butter. Extreme genius in every one of his rhymes. This is simply my favorite album of all time. <br />A fantastic album with such bomb songs as Gin & Juice, Ain't No Fun, What's My Name, Tha Shiznit, Murder was The Case, Doggy Dogg World, etc, etc. Anyone who is affiliated with rap or R&B NEEDS this album. Yes newcomers, go buy this album right this second cause the vets of the game already know and they already have it. You should be slapping yourself for even reading this review. Instead you should be spending time gathering loot to buy this ULTIMATE album. A must have for anyone. BUY it, it is truly a listening experience.
B00004YYDI|5.0|This movie is electric.  I would give the movie a higher rating if I could.  Jean Reno plays a cleaner named Leon who is a very top notch killer.  The ways he takes people out or finds ways to get to them are amazing.  Natalie Portman is also in this movie and she plays her role great too.  She is a 12 year old girl who's life is bad and her parents are killed by DEA Agents.  Leon takes her under his wing and she fills the emptiness in his life while he trains her to be a cleaner. The plot summary I gave doesn't do it justice, its much more indepth than what I said. This movie is filled with explosive action, drama, and suspense.  Once you see this movie you will want to see it a hundred times over.  Leon is one of my favorite movies and I'm telling you it really blows away alot of other \\"action\\" movies.  There is a reason why this movie is an international hit, so stop reading this review and just buy the movie.  Make sure you buy the international edition.  It is longer and it shows more of the relationship between Leon and Mathilda.
B0000019PA|5.0|Neutral Milk Hotel's In the Aeroplane Over the Sea is simply brilliant. Magnum's approach-the placement of gorgeous, wonderfully-compact narratives against a sprawling landscape of horns and acoustic guitar-while at first glance seeming trite and overly esoteric, proves breathtaking, to say the least. Highly recommended!
B00006879E|5.0|This band is sooo good.  Their music is fresh and clean with a new sound...not too rock, not too soul.  I've found myself listening to every single song on the CD.  Great cd and band, buy their CD and support them!!
B000000OU0|4.0|This superb live album was the event of the year when it was released, based more on the fact that the individual members of the former super-group had likened their chances to reforming as a group was as likely as the title. Well, all things are possible to those who wait, and our wait has been rewarded with a richly textured and memorable effort that covers many of their best previous songs as well as several new ones. Thus we trip from \\"Tequila Sunrise\\" to \\"Hotel California\\", from \\"New York Minute\\" to \\"Desperado\\", and from \\"Take It Easy\\" to \\"Life In The Fast Lane\\". The simple fact that they are out there creating and working together gives one hope for future works, and given other recent efforts like \\"A Hole In The Sky\\", it appears they are again gathering and recording. Hope we don't have to wait for Hell to freeze over again. Enjoy!
B00000DGUG|4.0|Go Alanis! I luuuuuuveeeed her first album this one is a bit rough on the edges but it is a very good effort i love the title to. I luuuv this Cd 2!
B00006F7S4|4.0|Too moody and downcast? I don't think so. Beck is nothing if not original and innovative and his musical dexterity enables him to change tact at a moments notice. \On Sea Change it's nice to just envelop yourself in the music and follow the lyrics and just get the vibe Beck is going for and that is all that's really required. The title is apt because the sea be akin to how the music feels, like a big calm ocean and the change because it is a new direction in comparison to his usual fare.
B000068IEU|4.0|I got this movie as an early Christmas present, but the first time i watched it was today. I've been really looking foward to seeing it, because it has been the only horror movie in my collection that i had not seen yet. So me and my twin brother picked the movie up when we came home from school and finally saw it for the first time. And come to think of it, it was actually much better than i thought it would be. This movie is defenitly Wes Craven's best in my opinion and he should plan on writing and directing more movies like this one. \\"The Last House On The Left\\" is a different kind of horror movie, it's just different. Craven shows the audience what real life terror is like. He takes you into the world of mad and macabre. As I was watching the film, i wasn't really scared at all, although there was one good jump scene. It wasn't that disturbing to me as much as it is to others because i'm into horror movies and they just don't disturb me. I actually got a few good laughs here and there at some points also. One thing that did catch my attention a lot was what the murderers made their victims do. They humiliated them in bizarre ways and sometimes i would laugh but feel bad for the victims at the same time. One thing that kind of dissapointed me was the end. I just didn't like how all the murderers were killed. It takes all the fun away for me and doesn't make it scary. Movies are much scarier when the good guys die and bad guys live. But, other than that, this was one of the most excellent horror films i have ever seen.
B00008H2LB|4.0|hello! i really don't understand how people can hate this album. as far as i'm concerned, linkin park must be applauded for venturing into new styles of music in this album, compared to their playing it safe with the same brand of rap-rock throughout the songs in Hybrid Theory. The strings, flutes and all those other samples mold together uniquely and because of this, Linkin Park stands in a league of its own for being fearless enough to experiment and making it work. so in some ways i do believe that meteora is a better album compared to hybrid theory.
0345452577|2.0|Conspiracy Club is either Kellerman's first manuscript (which may be correct given the type of clinical practice of the main character - comparable to Dr. Kellerman's early years in psychology), or a more recent manuscript written in a week.  Overall, it is much more comparable to the Billy Straight novels than the usual enjoyable Delaware fare.  From the perspective of a practicing psychologist, Dr. Carrier is no Alex Delaware - and isn't much of a psychologist either.  He has at least as much psychopathology as any other character in the book; and that's not entertaining.  Other characters are inadequately developed, the plot is convoluted, and the rush to conclusion is too improbable to believe - even when attempting to suspend reality for the sake of entertainment.  Kellerman has done a lot for mystery readers and for psychologists; Let's hope that he bounces back again and produces another carefully thought out psychological mystery.  Kellerman can be a good producer of interesting and intricate characters and story lines; we want and expect better than this.  This one will be on my bookshelf, but only to complete the Kellerman work product.
B000002HEP|4.0|Kyuss' third album is a bit lighter and more meditative than their masterpiece \\"Blues for the Red Sun\\". This also means that in many occasions there is plenty of room and attention for melodies, not that \\"Blues...\\" was lacking any. The album structure of dividing the record into three parts allows the songs to grow longer in actual length and is not limiting the music within the traditional song structures. Highly recdommended.
B0000E2FLC|4.0|I gave this dvd 4 stars because i love ac/dc and i love this concert but epic really butchered the audio on this dvd.What i mean is that the audio from the original vhs version is not the same on some tracks.Basically what you see is not what you hear.They've put a different live version of the same song on some tracks and it's very noticeable in some spots.I'm kind of dissapointed with this almost great dvd.I don't know why they just didn't put the original audio of the concert on this dvd or maybe thats the reason why this dvd is so inexpensive but you wouldn't think just transferring the the origianl concert from vhs to dvd would be so hard.But on the up side the picture qaulity is great and Angus's playing is amazing, just wish i could say his playing was amazing at that concert 12 years ago but i geuss i'll have to go back the vhs version for that.<br />But check out ac/dc's other dvd's(that haven't been tampered with)\\"No Bull\\"(my fave) and \\"Stiff Upper Lip Live\\".
B000002UAR|5.0|Quite simply, Revolver is as good as it gets.  This is the last album McCartney, Lennon, Harrison and Starr recorded as a touring band, and you can hear them stretching their wings in terms of arrangement and song structure resulting in songs that redefined rock n' roll.  Because the Beatles were still touring at the time, the performances are filled with the raw energy and exuberance of their earlier sound; adversely, because they were discovering how to use the studio with the impeccable assistance of George Martin, the record is more experimental and sophisticated than ever before.  All previous efforts (with the possible exception of Rubber Soul) were relatively simple affairs, and all subsequent albums reflected the sound of a professional studio band.  Revolver is the most exciting Beatles album because it finds the band in between these phases, drawing the best from both worlds.  <BR> Oh yeah, the songs are good too.  George really proved himself on this one, finally providing a song that bettered the work of Lennon-McCartney in \\"Taxman\\".  He also gave us an Indian indulgence that WASN'T boring in \\"Love You To\\".  McCartney was revealing himself as the master of pop melody in such stellar songs as \\"Eleanor Rigby\\" and \\"For No One\\".  But it's Lennon that really makes this an interesting affair.  He successfully makes a song about being tired sound amazing in \\"I'm Only Sleeping\\", and elsewhere, provides the record's most experimental song with \\"Tomorrow Never Knows\\".  Tape tricks, distorted vocals, exotic rhythms, it's all there.  And the song that Lennon tossed off - \\"And Your Bird Can Sing\\", is my favorite song on the album for it's infectious melody and manic guitar riffing courtesy of George.  I don't want to get into song-by-song analysis, but \\"She Said She Said\\" is amazing as well (what can I say I love Lennon's work).  <BR> Other Beatle's albums may have had more innovation and more range, but none were better than \\"Revolver\\".  This is the place to start if you want to get into the Beatles, but beware:  once you're in you can't get out.  Anyone who appreciates rock, pop, or anything else, should own this album.  This is a true classic.
B000094DUP|5.0|Delta Goodrem has a truly sensational voice.  She does a style of music that most performers are too scared to try.  She has a power in her voice that reminds me of Celine Dion, yet she's not afraid to use the harder background sounds that you would hear from Evanescence's music.  The amount of emotion Delta is able to portray in her voice is absolutely remarkable and will undoubtedly inspire the musicians in all of us.  With fun and beautiful songs that you can't help but to sing along with, this girl is going to go far with her career.
0385335482|5.0|I personally have to admit that I chose this book by it's cover. It looks interesting and seemed light headed  to read. I was looking forward to a more fiction, non realistic story without depts and angles much in the characters and plot. Sophie Kinsella had proved that all wrong. I was glued to the book from the begining to the end and was very much inspired by the main character in the book. <BR>  Rebecca Bloomwood has characteristics that you can and can't find in the real world. Her character exagerate what's inside many people. She was able to do all ordinary things, but at the same time we're able to see her other side of everything. I think that's the best way to help me relate to the characters in the book.<BR>  I was inspired deeply by Rebecca, and her optimistic ideas that changed my view of life.
B00003CWTI|2.0|I had high hopes for Magnolia, especially after the intro, thinking it would be like Robert Altman's \\"Short Cuts\\" - seemingly parallel lives intertwining in unexpected, positive or even fleeting sorts of ways, but was disappointed.<br />I didn't hire the movie for the similarities with Short Cuts though.  I was hoping it would be a good drama, especially as I enjoyed \\"Boogie Nights\\", one of PT Anderson's previous offerings.  It's a drama all right (!), but not a good one.  It is boring, going on for three hours, and nothing happens quickly.  (So drawn out it should have been French!)<br />I normally like emotional dramas and it took me a while to figure out why I didn't like Magnolia.  The main problem is that there is nobody really likeable in the story.  They all have their demons or glaring character flaws, and hardly any redeeming qualities.  OK, nobody's perfect - that's life - but you still need someone to root for, and most people aren't that despicable.<br />The music within the film was another major turnoff.  It is loud, often crowding out the dialogue, and hardly stops!  Very distracting, and unnecessary (Magnolia wasn't meant to be a musical, was it?!).  The scene where just about all the main characters sing along in different locations to the same song was stupid, and very embarrassing.<br />The only plus was the acting of Tom Cruise, showing that he can tackle serious roles.  The character he played was particularly loathsome, which made his part that much harder.
B000025XKM|5.0|In the throes of a depression that would see him dead at the age of 26 from an overdose of anti-depression medication, Nick Drake still managed to produce his last album, \\"Pink Moon.\\"  Unlike his first two efforts, which consisted of orchestrated folk-pop music, this 1972 album was just Drake playing his acoustic guitar and singing (with a bit of piano here and there).  The result is a bleak testament to melancholy and alienation that has a haunting and pristine beauty.  There are only eleven songs, most of which are under three minutes in length, which is why the album is not even a half-hour long, but there is a sense in which anything longer would be too much to bear.  \\"Pink Moon,\\" by itself, justifies Drake's status as a cult figure among those who love folk-rock.<br />Ironically, you have probably hear Nick Drake's music before, because the title track was used for a Volkswaggen commercial, just another example of how music is perverted to commercial interests (what else is new?).  I have been spending the cold winter putting together mixes of folk music (in the broadest sense) and making a concerted effort to get beyond Bob Dylan and the Byrds to explore the likes of Sandy Denny and the Beau Brummels.  Checking out Sandy Denny led me to Fairport Convention and Richard Thompson, and eventually to Ralph McTell and Nick Drake.  Now I can only wonder what rock I have been living under that I have never come across these artists before.<br />The title track is a beautiful folk ballad, performed with just Drake's superb acoustic guitar playing and haunting vocal.  Throughout the album you notice the depth of his lyrics and his guitar playing.  The latter might have been lost in an album with orchestration, but here you have the opportunity to listen to the openings of \\"Radio\\" and \\"Parasite\\" unadorned.  For the former a choice example would be the opening of what is probably the best song on the album (it is hard to choose), \\"Which Will,\\" which begins: \\"Which will you go for/Which will you love/Which will you choose from/From the stars above?\\"  There is a simple elegance to the lyrics, captured by the vocals, and complimented by the more complex guitar playing.<br />Nick Drake only produced three albums, so there is no reason not to have all of them in your music library.  These works represent the very best of the British folk-rock scene and Drake is a first rate singer-songwriter whose songs of failed romance, mortality, and depression are quite affective.  Drake intended \\"Pink Moon\\" to be his final album, saying he had nothing left to record.  When you lose yourself listening to these songs, you can actually convince yourself that this was true.u go for/Which will you love/Which will you choose from/From the stars above?\\"  There is a simple elegance to the lyrics, captured by the vocals, and complimented by the more complex guitar playing.<br />Nick Drake only produced three albums, so there is no reason not to have all of them in your music library.

B00006CXSS|5.0|this is the greatest box set ever.  have watched this movie straight through atleast 3 times.  actors did an awesome job, and very factual.  do buy!!!
B0000CFW87|5.0|I have 3 words for you- BUY IT NOW! This CD is so good that I can't stop listening to it over and over! I became a Josh Groban fan years ago when I saw him sing \\"The Prayer\\" with Charlotte Church. He's got an exceptional talent, like Charlotte Church, so if you like her then you will definetly love Josh Groban too. His album \\"Closer\\" has a nice blend of ballads and more upbeat, modern songs. Some people want Josh to stay classical but I think he does an equally great job singing the more modern songs, like \\"Never Let Go,\\" and \\"Remember When It Rained.\\" It was actually nice to hear him sing something a bit different but sing just as well. Don't get me wrong because I love classical music! He refers himself as more \\"pop\\" than \\"classical\\" anyhow. \\"Never Let Go\\" is my most favorite song on there, though I have many favorites like the beautiful \\"Mi Mancherai\\" and \\"Oceano\\". He even included \\"Broken Vow\\" on his new album, a song that he first sung on the PBS special, about how he let his love go to be with another man. His first album was terrific but I think this one is even better, and it is a more mature Groban. I don't think I can truly express how I feel about this album, so my advice to you is to just buy it and experience it for yourself- it will be sure to blow you away.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Firefly is, without a doubt, one of the best series ever made, and certainly my favorite.  The cast is superb, each one so true to their character, and it is clear from watching the show how much each one loved their job, how well they got along, and how much fun they had making every episode.<br />Firefly is an amazing blend of Science Fiction and the \\"Wild Wild West.\\"  Set in the future, with shocking parallels to our own times, the series is set on the edge of space, in the frontier worlds.  It captures the lives, emotions, and energy of the characters as they try to make their own way in the world.<br />Every episode is a blend of seriousness and humor, and every story is well-told, with great special effects, superb acting, and an attention to every little detail - from camera angles to the music - that will undoubtedly having you fall in love with this series.<br />If you missed it on TV, don't miss it on DVD.  And when you're done watching, you'll wonder the same thing the rest of us have yet to figure out: why did Fox cancel this amazing show?<br />Because there's no way to watch Firefly, and not love it.
B00005JMJ4|5.0|This is a beautiful and masterfully crafted piece of art. Charlotte and Bob are two people who are at different places in their lives, yet they both feel a bit lost. She has recently graduated from college, is unsure of what she is meant to be, and is just realizing that the honeymoon period of her marriage is coming to an end. He is a movie star whose career has reached a plateau and whose relationship with his wife has become more focused on the practicalities of choosing carpet color and taking care of the kids. They both need a kick-start, something to motivate them. <br />This is a place in life that everyone in the audience can identify with, and Scarlett Johansson and Bill Murray play these roles with the perfect combination of sympathy, subtlety, and ironic humor. You like the characters without feeling sorry for them.<br />The setting in which they meet, an impersonal modern hotel in the heart of Tokyo, where both are jetlagged and are not entirely thrilled to be, is a metaphor for the lonliness and isolation they both feel in their lives. And thus an unspoken kinship develops. They are neither emotionally nor physically intimate with each other, after all, they just met. Their friendship unfolds slowly and naturally, and their connection is based on the experiences rather than the intimacies they share. This makes the friendship that develops between them very believable despite their vast age difference. What results is a sweet, funny movie with a lot of heart that is not overly sentimental.<br />It's the best movie I've seen in many years and the only one I've been inspired to write a review for. I highly, highly recommend it.
B00002Z88D|5.0|This is by far one of the greatest cds ever, let alone a live cd.I'm a true musician and love every type of music other than rap so for a cd that has one of my favorite bands:metallica and a symphony was a great idea. For anyone who doesn't know micheal kamen (r.i.p) was one of the best composers of this century so metallica was very lucky to be able to collabarate with him. Everything about this cd is great, especially how the orchestra compliments the riffs.Definatley a must have.
B00005JMJ4|5.0|This is by far the best movie of the year.I can't believe the people who says that the movie is overrated...Keep buying your popcorn and leave this marterpiece for real movie lovers.
B00005JKZV|1.0|It cracks me up that all you losers are giving this movie five stars. Move out of your parents basements already and take a chance and kiss a girl. What is this movie but a bunch of wizards and dwarfs and fairys running around and killing eachother over a wedding ring? It's beyond laughable. I'd rather be electrocuted with high voltage testicular clamps than watch a movie with repressed queer eye for the straight guy themes. A bunch of men hanging out with fairys--\\"Oh yeah, I get it!\\" This movie is all bad acting from the word go. I have a theory on why people love this trilogy. They feel that because the filmakers and writers and actors try so hard to make an \\"Epic Saga of Biblical Proportions\\" that they (the movie-goers) must give the film crew great reviews. I am different. I will not give good reviews to a movie just because it takes the time from middle earth till now, just to watch it. And now I, the great wizard will cast a spell. I call it the \\"I'm too influenced by movie advertising and narrow minded hype storms to think for myself spell.\\" See, it's already working. Now go out and see the whole trilogy, fairy. While you're there, I'll be taking your girlfriend out to dinner.<br />Part Two: Clearly, my review has upset Ian V. Shiff (his review is just above mine). And having done such a thing I would now feel remiss if I did not offer a humble, heartfelt apology. So, I would just like to say I'm sorry. I'm sorry that you're a nimble minded fool. I'm sorry that your vocabulary is so weak you have to resort to profanity just to get your point across, but most of all I'm sorry that you're a glasses-wearing acne-faced nerd. But if you want to blame somebody blame the Lord, and that's the Lord of humanity, not the Lord of the Dingleberries (just in case you got the two confused). And for the Lord's sake, stop wearing your hobit outfit to the movies (You look absurd and hobbits aren't real). And, contrary to what you'be been told, prancing around in your underwearwhile you re-enact the movie scenes in your bedroom is NOT cool, and chicks will not understand that. Don't forget to write your parents a rent check! Take care for now, Dingleberry.
B0000C7PSW|1.0|I have never heard anything that has wanted to fall asleep, cry, and kill myself at the same time.  Bad song writing and wishy-washy lyrics make for a bad listening experience.

0375422307|5.0|Persepolis is the autobiography of Marjane Satrapi told in graphic novel form.  It can most easily be described as a combination of of Maus and The Diary of Anne Frank.  However, it is much more than that.  It is a book that stands on its own with an account and lessons that are both unique and deeply personal.  <br />At its most basic level, Persepolis is a history of Iran.  It begins with an introduction which recounts a brief history of Iran from its founding until the Islamic Revolution.  The story of the Satrapi family then takes over.  It reveals how a relatively progressive family must cope and change every aspect of their lives under an increasingly oppressive regime.  This story is told from the eyes of a fiercely independent young girl.  She must not only deal with the normal circumstances of growing from a child to an adult, but she also has to grow up dealing with Iran's Islamic Revolution and its war with Iraq.  She must learn to deal with the imprisonment and \\"disappearance\\" of many people who she knows and knows of.  She must also cope with having to hide the person she is since most of her interests and thoughts are illegal in her country.<br />I read a review of this book several months ago and knew I just had to read it.  It turned out to be much more than I ever thought it would be.  Although it is an \\"easy read\\" and in comic book format, the emotions and thoughts of Satrapi and the people around her come through quite poignantly.  I recommend this book for the story it tells and the emotions it conveys.  I believe it will be enjoyable to people of many ages and backgrounds.  I can't wait to read the sequel!
B0000C7PSW|2.0|Okay, let me lay this down on ya...<BR>This dude is different, I bought the CD today and I popped it in the car stereo, the first track is just plain nauseating until the tuba part comes into play and the it's just confusing.  The only part that redeemed the album somewhat was 14 Street.  That is why the album gets a two.
B00012QM8G|5.0|Let me tell you, never before have I been as mesmerized, touched, and enthralled by such a dramatic movie as this. Without a doubt there is no equal to Steven Spielberg in this day and age, and also no better acting talent than the ones assembled for the roles in \\"Schindler's List.\\" Liam Neeson gives such a forcefully powerful role of the conflicted Oskar Schindler, with Ralph Fiennes as the even more emotional and captivating character in this film (that of Amon). Fine work is also turned out by renowned legend Sir Ben Kingsley, not to mention the other fantastic minor parts in the feature such as Caroline Goodall as Emilie. However, it goes without saying that this film's epic proportions would not have reached as high a stature without the enduring work and grueling hours of effort put in behind the scenes by the lesser known faces. One of these names includes the brilliant hand of writer Steve Zaillian,  beautifully adapted the chilling Thomas Keneally novel for the big screen (not to mention picking up the kudos from Mr. Oscar). Then there's composer John Williams, a musical mastermind who's haunting yet irresistible score to this picture has added another cinematic achievement onto his shelf (which happens to include the scores to \\"Star Wars Trilogy,\\" \\"Indiana Jones Trilogy,\\" \\"ET,\\" \\"Jaws,\\" \\"Close Encounters of the Third Kind,\\" \\"Superman,\\" and many other timeless classics). Producers Branko Lustig and Gerald Molen may sound unfamiliar to many, but not if you read their credits which include their marvelous work on this film (these credits include \\"Rain Man,\\" \\"The Color Purple,\\" Gladiator,\\" \\"Black Hawk Down,\\"Tootsie,\\" and others). Other names for sure worthy of mention, and believe me I cannot name them all, include cinematographer Janusz Kaminski, editor Michael Kahn, chief casting director Juliet Taylor, production designer Allan Starski, set decorator Ewa Brau, costume designer Anna Sheppard, film distributors MCA/Universal and Amblin Entertainment, the Art,Makeup, Production, Directors, Sound, and Effects departments, and all the other individuals that made this award-winning drama possible.<BR>To conclude this review, I'd just like to say that I've been waiting for over ten years to see this film released on the DVD format, so as to serve the purpose of restoring this gem of art to the level it deserves. Now that that time has come upon us, I have nothing left to say but........it was well worth the wait.
B00005N9CV|1.0|It completely amazes me that the jazz field is so zoned out today that it promotes a flat and lifeless singer like Ms. Kral yet ignores great talent like Carmen Lundy, Diane Schuur and Ernestine Anderson!!  If you are really interested in great jazz singing check out the amazing \\"Love Makes The Changes\\" by Ernestine Anderson and \\"Something To Believe In\\" by Carmen Lundy!!  These will both spin your head around and show you what great jazz singing is all about!!  The production on The Look Of Love is superb but the vocal tracks are not inspired and bring nothing interesting to the great program of songs!!  Now if Ms. Lundy or Ernestine Anderson laid down the vocals in this great production then we  would have something to get excited about!!!!  For now those of us who love great singing can only wish and hope for the day when the jazz world wakes up from its stupor and gets behind great talent.  In the long run exciting artists create excited fans who rush to buy product that has something of substance to get excited about over and over!!!  I see tons of understock everywhere I go on the works of the overpromoted Ms. Kral.
0671781383|5.0|Viktor Frankl deserves the highest respect, much as Nelson Mandela does today although the severity of the experience would have been somewhat harsher but less daunting in time. Frankl's book covers two main aspects in his title: Search for Meaning, the first details his experiences in Auschwitz, one of the worst concentration camps used by the Nazis and controlled by the SS. The second part of the book outlines his own way of psychotherapy entitled Logotherapy, refering to the Greek word Logos, in this case related to meaning. It approaches the process of psychotherapy in a completely different way from that of Freud. <br />It's the first part of the book which completely captures the reader, its simply unputdownable, Frankl's suffering in the camps is remarkable in the sense of the humanity he talks of rather than the  more than obvious horrors he must have been exposed to. The camp changed him as a human being or rather, one feels, that Frankl grows into his own humanity expanding what was already there in potential form as he reminds the reader that his early Logotherapy manuscript was with him in the camp, although lost. It is edifying that he returns from the camp in a spirit of underlying trust in humanity's ability to, so to speak, save itself. <br />In the second part he describes Logotherapy and the techniques used to put it into practice. The therapy deals with the search for meaning in a person's life and the lack of it in present society. This has of course been even more exacerbated in current times compared with the more moderate version of the 50's and 60's of Frankl's era. It is in fact remarkable that this kind of therapy has not taken over from other forms given its obvious improvement over older more mechanical and less human forms of therapy.<br />Its a remarkable work deserving of the highest respect.
B000005Z0E|4.0|This is one of the best albums I own, and I dont mean only 2pac. Compared to many other rappers he made a relly strong debut. <BR>The album starts up with \\"Young Black Male\\", a track which talks about life on the streets, cash, women and sex. Its not my favorite track but its ok. <br />My personal favorite on this album would be Soulja's Story, in which Pac raps almost demonically in the beginning. The way he changes his voice, its almost scary. Its about his early life, his family and his problems growing up. <br />Another nice song is \\"Crooked A** N*ggaz. Its got added rhymes of the NWA stars Eazy-E, Ice Cube and Dr. Dre in it, from thier album \\"Straight Outta Compton\\", along with a strong preformance from Stretch. Tupacs rapping on this song is not the strongest he has ever done, but its clearly approved. A couple of more really good tracks are \\"Brenda's Got A Baby\\" and \\"Words of Wisdom\\". <br />If you like 2pac this is the album to buy first, along with \\"All Eyez On Me\\". He hasnt done any bad albums, but buy the original albums before the remixed ones which has come out after his death.<br />TUPAC R.I.P
B0012GMV58|5.0|This is the 1973-era Santana band which was featured on the Japanese [[ASIN:B0000027D5 Lotus]] triple live album. Jazz singer Leon Thomas was part of this group, and Welcome continues the Caravanserai album format of instrumental-only and vocal tracks, seamlessly flowing into one another.    Strings, marimba, male/female vocals and multiple keyboards (by Tom Coster and Richard Kermode) are tastefully and creatively employed on selected tracks. This was the most musically proficient Santana ensemble ever - drummer Maitreya Michael Shrieve spurs the groove and improvisations, and guitarist Mahavishnu John McLaughlin (with whom Santana recorded the previous year's [[ASIN:B0000AKY7R Love Devotion Surrender]] album) guests on 'Flame-Sky'. Return To Forever members Joe Farrell-flute and Flora Purim-vocal are also featured on 'When I Look Into Your Eyes' and 'Yours Is The Light'. The album serenely concludes with the John Coltrane composition 'Welcome'. (one previously unreleased bonus track on this CD issue - the Santana/Shrieve/Coster composition 'Mantra'.)    In a similar vein from the following year 1974 is [[ASIN:B000006ZUV Illuminations]], co-credited to Devadip Carlos Santana and Turiya Alice Coltrane (Santana, McLaughlin, and Coltrane were disciples of Sri Chinmoy during this period). Featuring more jazz personnel such as McLaughlin, bassist Dave Holland and drummer Jack DeJohnette, it's the most avant-garde and challenging Santana album of all. Start your journey with Welcome, then try [[ASIN:B0000027D5 Lotus]] ...
0792844890|5.0|Excellent!!! I have not watched any other movie with such an exquisite taste of satire!
0030839939|4.0|Whenever you think about learning Solid State Physics, or the first stage of Condensed Matter Physics for college level, the Ashcroft/Mermin book is always the first textbook that you should chose. It covers almost everything basic carefully.<BR>But a couple of things make the evaluation lower.<BR>First, and obviously, the book is too old. It was published 18 years ago and never got any new edition. During this long long long time, Solid State Physics has already changed much. Semiconductors are already the most important topics and the discoveries of high Tc Superconductivity and Quantum Hall Effect in low dimensional systems have already largely switched people's interest in physics of Solid to a regime stressed on interactions and disorders... Many books start trying to put these topics together, but nothing better than seeing a new version of Ashcroft/Mermin with the new topics well integrated in.<BR>The other one is about the presentation of this book. I just taught the class of Solid State Physics last year for the first time, and it turns out the presentation of the book is not so friendly to everyone. The chaptors of Nearly free electrons and Tight Binding model of the Band Theory are made fairly long, while not constructed in the best way, resulting in the puzzle of many students. Of course, if you study carefully, you still can get the ideas, but a lot of time is wasted. Considering the importance of these chaptors, this really pulls back the evaluation of the book. My suggestion is, when you study Solid State Physics, have more books as your reference, don't stick only on A/M when you feel troubled, although the A/M is still the best one in general. <BR>I really hope the new edition of this book comes out soon, but considering the age of the authors, it may never happen.
0385504209|3.0|This book is an exciting read, but the ending was so disappointing that it took away from its promise. At the end, all of the puzzles and games to figure things out seem nothing but stupid.  I enjoyed Defenders of the Holy Grail, another novel with similiar themes, much more.
B00009V7P8|5.0|Looks like everyone has covered the album from every angle, so I will just say this: I saw DR at the Fillmore with his full band and I can honestly say that it was the best concert I've seen in several years.  This is a BAND and they really, really know what they're doing.  They took the uber-beautiful acoustic songs on this record and took them into fantastic new places, from Radiohead-like noise symphonies (they even quoted from the crescendo of \\"Creep\\" during \\"The Blower's Daughter,\\" acheiving a startling level of Pure Rock Majesty) to reggae to opera to gypsy balladry.  We were even treated to (seriously) a cello-and-voice rendition of \\"Seven Nation Army\\" and a human beatbox version of \\"Billie Jean.\\"  Ironically, the climax of the night was \\"Cold Water,\\" the softest, most plaintive song on the album - Damien had them turn all the lights in the joint off - not down, but OFF, and the band played the whole song in utter darkness, while the audience stood in perfect, blissful silence and soaked it in.<BR>Of course, regardless, it's worth the ticket price just to get to be in the presence of Lisa Hannigan, DR's co-lead singer.  If there are angels, they have to look and sound just like her.  Her voice and percussion version of \\"Be My Husband\\" has to be one of the sexiest songs ever - she had every guy and a lot of the girls in the place saying \\"OK.\\"<BR>He comes back to the states in March, folks - don't miss him.  Seriously.<BR>Oh, and if you think \\"Volcano\\" is groovy on record? Just. You. Wait.
B00005JMCN|5.0|I simply cannot wrap my mind around the concept of someone giving this amazing film less than five stars.  I do not claim to be a superior critic, just a humble avid moviegoer who would like to believe she can detect a consumate, crafted work of art such as this motion picture.  <br />I'm sorry; but movies like this are not made everyday.  This is truly a rare and brilliant gem.  The story that this film is based upon does not simply center on the racing career of a Thoroughbred, but, it is a lyrical, fluid tribute to the time period, the people of involved with Seabiscuit's success and Seabiscuit himself.  <br />Although it is gritty and realistic, there is such a beautiful, adept handling of the cinematography in visually retelling the story of Seabiscuit:  light, yet stunning and effective.  It literally took my breath away.<br />So much care and attention and detail went into the making of this film, and yet, it never felt heavy-handed.  It was never too dry or too overwhelming; it was a perfect mixture of alternately focusing on the era, the people involved, and Seabiscuit's life.  <br />Although there is a narrator speaking intermittently throughout the film, there are many moments when the film breaks away from the ongoing action to display period stills. These haunting images are whole film scenes in and of themselves that articulate volumes in the continuation of the story's progress. Everything about the cinematography and the editing were accomplished in a most beautiful, lyrical and unabrupt fashion. <br />What makes me so in love with this movie is not only are  the cinematography, editing, production, direction,  and the acting of a superior caliber, but also that the *story* matches that high caliber of excellence.  It all comes together and meshes into this wonderful presentation.<br />I waited to purchase this movie on DVD rather than go and see it in the theatres.  I figured, \\"it is just a movie about a racehorse -- it is probably going to be dry and uneventful.\\"  I made such a regrettable call on that one.  I would have *loved* to have seen it on the big screen, and lament the missed opportunity to do so due to my own lack of better judgment.  <br />I was so entrenched in the movie; all my senses were delightfully engaged:  I was enjoying not only the sheer beauty of the physical presence the movie conducted, I was also absorbed by the incredible story it told.<br />I would like to encourage you to buy and enjoy.
B00006RINF|4.0|I must say that I was not too enraptured by their first few albums, but this one is simply STUNNING! If they would just drop the guy who \\"sings\\" (s.i.c.) and let Cristina do all the vocals, they would be perfect. She has the most enticing, sensual voice I've ever heard, and a much better range than any of her competition. Who am I kidding? WHAT competition? Beauty and vocal talent supreme! <BR>But this isn't a beauty pageant, it's METAL, and this is definitely a HEAVY f'n record. Waldemar Sorychta has not lost his skills as a knob-twiddler, and in fact gets better every time. The sonic punch on this album is bludgeoning.<BR>In the end, though, you have to get this for Cristina and her supernatural voice, especially the melodies she conjures on \\"Swamped\\" and \\"Unspoken\\". Unbelievable....
6305736650|5.0|\\"Casablanca\\" is a great movie classic for many audiences to enjoy.  It deservingly won three Oscars in 1943, including Best Picture.  This was filmed and written beautifully.  This highly original plot has influenced many movies filmed after this, and it remains ahead of its time.  Despite its war theme, it digs deep into the romance and jelously elements.  The plot continues to build as Rick (played by Humphrey Bogart) feels more obligated to protect his ex-lover Ilsa (played by Ingrid Bergman) and her husband from any Nazis in the area.  Many twists and turns arise, always keeping audiences interested.  The acting from all the performers is marvelous.  Bogart, previously known as the rough guy, wonderfully transforms himself into a more sensative guy for his Oscar nominated role.  Though a lot of roughness still lingers, the change is very noticable.  Bergman beautifully portrays her sense of danger and love in one of her best roles in her career.  All other actors, major or minor, also perform wonderfully.  \\"Casablanca\\" proves that it will remain a classic for many more years.  It is sure to please audience of all kinds.<br />\\"Here's lookin' at you, kid.\\"

Evanescence is the best!
0792839730|2.0|I don't think of myself as a \\"DVD whiner\\" in that I've never felt cause to complain about the quality of a DVD before.  However, I recently purchased \\"A Bridge Too Far\\" on DVD and even I noticed the poor quality of the picture.  As another viewer noticed there are tiny white scratch blips throughout the movie and the overall picture quality is low- looks very washed-out and aged.<br />Maybe I am naive, but weren't DVD's supposed to give superior picture and sound performance in comparison to VHS?  I purchased a VHS version of \\"A Bridge Too Far\\" in 1990 and its picture quality is still higher than my DVD.  About the only thing the DVD has over my VHS copy is the fact that it is in widescreen- a big plus when watching this epic movie.<br />I know \\"A Bridge Too Far\\" received mixed reviews and mediocre box-office when it was released in 1977 and that probably ensures that it will never have a big budget, restored, special features galore DVD.  However, one would think a movie with its budget and all-star cast would at least be released in DVD with some sort of upgrade as to its picture quality.

B000002ACR|5.0|Get together a group of twenty Byrds fans, chances are you'll have twenty different ideas about which one of their classic albums was the best. Was it the neo-Beatles fresh excitement of Mr. Tambourine Man?? The sci-fi dominant sound of 5D? Or perhaps the country-rock twang of that groundbreaking phenomenon known as Sweetheart of the Rodeo??? If you were to ask my opinion (go ahead, ask!), the Byrds best album is a tossup between two classics: The often-overlooked, always underrated slab of sci-fi fuzztone country hard rock known as Dr. Byrds and Mr. Hyde, or Younger Than Yesterday, the masterpiece you see before you. By 1967, the Byrds songwriting skills and musical direction were at their peak, even after the loss of such a seminal talent as Gene Clark. Younger is a thoroughly appealing mix of sci-fi, mystic wonder, post-Beatles enthusiasm, and just enough cynicism to give the whole thing some perspective. \\"So You Want To Be A Rock And Roll Star\\" rolls along at ninety miles a minute and features guest performances by trumpeter Hugh Masekela and percussionist Big Black (not to mention real Byrds-screams from fans lifted from a British concert date!) As David Crosby once said, it comes across as \\"a little cynical,\\" but also like a lot of fun. \\"Have You Seen Her Face\\" features a fresh, Beatlesque feel and super guitar from soon-to-be-fulltime-Byrd Clarence White. \\"CTA-102\\" is pure, enjoyably danceable nonsense, complete with space aliens, while \\"Renaissance Fair\\" is the Cros at his most positive as he takes in one of those time-flashback-type hippie events. \\"Time Between\\" is one of the first (and best) Byrdsongs featuring Chris Hillman (plus more great Clarence White guitar), while \\"Everybody's Been Burned\\" is simply Crosby at his introspective best. But where, oh where do you ask, is Roger McGuinn, the heart and soul of this little sewing circle? Why, merely cutting one of the finest Dylan covers ever put to vinyl. \\"My Back Pages,\\" like much of McGuinn's best work,has a timeless, transcendant feel, courtesy in no small part to his fabulous electric 12-string Rickenbacher guitar. Fantastic!! All this plus five bonus cuts (the standout for me is \\"Old John Robertson,\\" a wonderful little vignette about an ageing movie cowboy) will be sure to put you in Byrd heaven. So get Younger Than Yesterday ASAP. All of us OTD types (Older Than Dirt, of course) are just waiting for you to put it on so we can all boogie in our walkers together!!!
0060537639|4.0|A good book does not have to be satisfying and an end in itself. A good book can also make you ask questions and go out and seek answers for yourself. 1421 is such a book to me.<br />After getting past the blind spot of cynicism regarding the book's rapid sales, or personal prejudice...

B00005JMGL|5.0|This film is NOT a remake of the Disney movie, but a faithful interpretation of the original classic by JM Barrie. It does not simply highlight the fantasy, pirates, and sword fighting (although all are present), but also explores issues in the book that were ignored by the earlier productions, such as the deep psychological undertones of the Peter-Wendy-Hook triangle, the latent sexual tension between Peter and Wendy, and the poignancy of Wendy's maturing feelings for Peter, who refuses to reciprocate. This is a great movie for kids, adults, and all lovers of the original book.<br />The child actors who play Peter and Wendy are both gorgeous and marvelous. It is heartbreaking to realize that neither exists anymore -- in real life, they're growing up.
B0000DJZA5|3.0|Let me start off this review by saying that this album is very good.  An improvement over the original?  I personally don't think so, but there are some modifications to certain songs (particularly 'The Long and Winding Road) that are certainly better.  My main problem with this album is the lie that this is the unaltered version of the original recordings.  Anybody who has seen the film can tell instantly that these are not the same 'live studio' and rooftop performances, with some songs losing a lot in comparison (particularly 'Let it Be' itself, where I always thought Paul's lyric 'there will be no sorrow' was very powerful).  If the whole pont is to market this as a unaltered 'naked' version of the 'Get Back' project, then why mess with the tapes at all?  Please, for the sake of music fans everywhere, pass on this, and pressure the powers that be to get busy on the 'Let It Be' DVD instead.  The fact that that hasn't been released has forced me to aquire the film via 'alternate' methods, but I certainly would be willing to pay for a DVD version despite this.
B0000AUHPG|5.0|Do two things when you watch this:  After watching the best of Sergio Leone's westerns, watch it again with the commentaries of Claudia Cardenale, John Milius, & John Carpenter, all of whom have remarkable insight to this splendid film.<br />The additiional segments are wonderful, & although I've had someone ask, \\"Why the bit on the railroad?\\", when you think about it, that's really what the film is all about.<br />The best additions the on any DVD, & fitting to Leone's film.
0385507755|5.0|The writings of Frey are as authentic as they come...his story is about running toward the edge of the cliff to the abyss and beginning the jump off into it.  Instead, he slips, trips and falls and is unsuccessful at destroying himself.  The remainder of the story is about recovery...which is essentially, the grueling process of dusting one's self off and figuring out how to walk again.<br />One of the most intriguing aspects and points of this book is, like all drug addiction, it knows no socio-economic background or intellectual status...like death, it is impartial to those things.  Some reviewers have criticized the childhood background that Mr. Frey has come.  While being a product of financially secure and caring parents, it shouldn't be used against a person to dilute the phenomenal amount of courage, dedication and perseverance it takes to recover.  Addiction doesn't care about wealth, friends or family.  It chooses victims across socio-economic and racial boundaries.  It doesn't care if you're married, single, divorced, straight or gay.  It is an equal opportunity taker of souls.<br />At the onset, recovery from addiction is two things...hard as hell and lonely.  Jim Frey puts his unique experience into a well told and thought out perspective.  His story was gross, cold, explicit, angry and at times, shameful.  His life today is heroic, inspiring and provides hope to those who are struggling with addiction...I know that the words of this story has certainly helped more than one person.  This book should give a bit of hope to all of those individuals struggling with addiction and recovery.
078681859X|5.0|this book is one of the best I've read in a long time. <br />this book is a wonderful perspective on modern day london with a twist of magic, demons, and revenge. I highly recommend this to any avid readers ready to gobble up another great fiction book!
630526323X|4.0|The first thing I need to point out before I write one word about this film is apparently there are two versions of this film. One in German another in English. I have seen the English version. There seems to be a difference in the pacing of both films. So for those who have seen the German film, don't get mad at me if I say this movie is not paced poorly.<br /> I have only seen a few movies by Werner Herzog they include \\"Aguirre: The Wrath of God\\", \\"Fitzcarraldo\\", and \\"Invincible\\". I personlly do not watch much German cinema and do not include Herzog among my favorite filmmakers. In fact of the little I've seen from Rainer Werner Fassbinder, I prefer him. But \\"Nosferatu\\" is a wonderful film and perhaps the one movie that impressed me most from Herzog.<br /> I have not seen the 1922 version of \\"Nosferatu\\", although if it's any constellation I have seen \\"Shadow of the Vampire\\".<br /> \\"Nosferatu\\" has such a vivid colorful and yet stark look to it. Herzog has created so many memorable images here. I've always thought of Greek filmmaker Theo Angelopolous as the master of imagery but here Herzog seems to be a close runner-up. There's a scene dealing with rats on a ship and instantly I started thinking of \\"Aguirre\\" and the final scene with the monkeys. Herzog and his cinematographer Jorg Schmidt-Reitwein have truly captured something special. In fact it's the camerawork that leads me to have such strong admiration for the movie.<br /> \\"Nosferatu\\" for those who have seen the countless (no pun intended) versions of Dracula films this one, and perhaps the 1922 version is the same, is quite a different take on the story. For instance Van Helsing does not think Dracula is \\"undead\\". he makes no effort to stop him. Renfeld is not sent to the count's castle and turned into his slave, instead Harker is. Harker works for Renfeld. And speaking of Renfeld, did anyone else think Roland Topor was doing a Peter Lorre imitation? And as one reviewer pointed out this is Lucy's story, which is quite true.<br /> This is not to say these things hurt the movie, just anyone who is a die-hard fan will notice these differences and who knows how someone would react.<br /> If your starting to became familiar with Herzog films, like I am, I don't think this is really the place to start. I'm not convinced this is one of his \\"typical\\" films. When I think of Herzog the first movie that comes to mind is \\"Aguirre\\", but, if your a Dracula fan or if you've seen the original you'll probably want to see this. Also it would be fun to compare the two.<br /> Bottom-line: Impressive take on the \\"Dracula\\" story with slight differences. Herzog and cinematographer create many memorable moments. And Klaus Kinski is quite good in the lead as is Isabelle Adjani (hello nurse!) as Lucy.is quite true.<br /> This is not to say these things hurt the movie, just anyone who is a die-hard fan will notice these differences and who knows how someone would react.<br /> If your starting to became familiar with Herzog films, like I am, I don't think this is really the place to start.

B0000AQS0F|5.0|I'm going to admit that I never watched this show when it was on Fox... But now that I've bought and watched the DVDs, I'm really sorry the shows over.  I think the show was doomed on Fox from the beginning - the premiere wasn't aired until the show had been canceled, and the shows aired out of order - which is really unfortunate.  Like Whedon's other shows - BtVS and Angel - the show is original, fun, and very well-written.  River is so well-played by Summer Glau; I found her character completely fascinating.  I also loved Alan Tudyk as Wash; he's great.  A wonderful actor, whether in comic relief or one of Wash's more serious moments.  Jewel Staite as Kaylee is another wonderful character: you can't help but love Kaylee.  In fact, the whole cast is fantastic.  I've heard Whedon hopes to make a Firefly movie, and I sincerely hope he does.  Until then, I will continually watch the DVDs.  Oh, and on a side-note, many of the commentary tracks that come with some of the episodes are a lot of fun, particularly Joss Whedon and Nathan Fillion's commentary for the episode Serenity.
B00005JMTQ|1.0|This movie started off strong and quickly went downhill. This movie felt like it was 5 hours long and I kept saying \\"Something's got to give\\"!  Will these people just get together already so I can get out of here. The first 15 minutes were interesting, but the rest just dragged on forever.  You know going into the movie they were going to end up together, but all this back and forth it's just so redundant.
1400049628|5.0|I highly recommend this book if you like Mel Brooks, are a horror fan, or just want an outstanding example of a parody.  Brooks uses the format of the typical \\"survival guide\\" to explore an interesting premise: what would you need to know if \\"Night of The Living Dead\\" style zombies really walked the earth?  The really funny aspect of this book is how serious the author seems.  He starts off with a pseudo-scientific explanation of how zombies are created, then proceeds to cover wepaons, hiding places, rules for traveling through zombie-infested territory, etc. I loved this one so much I could hardly put it down, and bought a gift copy for my brother.  Great stuff!
B00005176F|4.0|Not really a big fan of Blur's (w/ or w/o Graham Coxon) or of Damon Albarn's, but I don't mean to say that this is a terrible cd.  In fact each of the songs is good, never mind if it's a bit esoteric sometimes (sample:  \\"It's got nothing to do with vorsprung durch technic you know\\").  Plus most of the music is pretty upbeat, and the styles are surprisingly diverse that make for a really fun listening.  This is a great way to introduce yourself to Blur.  You'll never get bored with it.<br />Suggestion:  for perfect driving companions (especially if you're set for a long drive) get this cd, along with \\"A Secret History\\", (also a best-of cd) by the Divine Comedy (this is the third time I'm actually \\"plugging\\" this!)
B00005JM20|5.0|I will be truthful I had my doubts on this movie. So I passed it up in the theaters! BIG MISTAKE! Johnny English is what english comedy is. If you thought Austin Powers was a brillant spoof on spy action flicks, you haven't met the one true class act of comedic spy action, Johnny English! Rowan Atkinson (Mr. Bean, Rat Race) delves deep into his already huge portfolio of comedic appearances and brings out the best of what a spy comedy is. Other credible talents are Natalie Imbruglia (singer, actress), John Malcovich (Con Air, Being John Malcovich) etc. Johnny English is a perefect comedy.. and just to note, my favorite scene is when he has his partner Bough play the contents of the DVD he confiscated! You wanna know what is on it... well, watch the movie!
B000002J09|5.0|This album, despite its heavily played airtime, is still the greatest rock album in my opinion. No one can equal this, and no one ever will. All of the key componets that made LZ great are here. I'll break it down for you.<br />Black dog-9.5/10. This is a great opener and is very multileveled as far as the sound goes. The only reason I didn't like it as much was you can hear Bonzo slapping his drumsticks to cue the music... you have to listen extremly closely. Hear it live for the best sound.<br />Rock n' Roll- 9.0/10. Would have been great if not for cadillac comercials. The end is the best when Bonham does the solo in the end. Great rockin' song that has a 50s sound to it.<br />Battle of Evermore- 10/10. Perfectly put together, my thrid favorite song on the album. The mandolin, acoustic guitar, and Plant's overlapping vocals make this a beautiful song about mythical legends.<br />Stairway to Heaven- 10/10. Well, not much you can say about this song. My second favorite song... just perfect. Slowly built up from acoustic to heavy solos, but Plant's lyrics make it happen.<br />Misty Mountain Hop- 9/10. Hippy satire driven by organ and guitar. Very catchy good-times song.<br />Four Sticks- 9.5/10. The drumming is done with four drumsticks, now that's impressive. Versatile and funky, or is it pretty? Has two levels to it.<br />Going to California- 9.5/10. Third best acoustic Zeppelin song only to Bron-Yr-Aur-Stomp and Babe, I'm Gonna Leave You. Melancholly and beautifly performed.<br />When Then Levee Breaks- 10/10. Personal favorite Zeppelin song. The drumming is great and hermonica overlapping is very well put together. The best is the bridge/chorus which is the best sound I've ever heard. Great Hard Rocker.

0385504209|5.0|First of all, this is a thoroughly entertaining and thought-provoking suspense novel...a work of FICTION. (How many among those who have vilified it as \\"heresy\\" have read it?) Brown is a storyteller, not a theologian. Establishing tension and achieving dramatic effect explain his use (abuse?) of historical as well as theological material. With great skill, he introduces and then develops a number of interesting characters within a gripping and cohesive plot, guiding the reader to what proves to be (given the narrative's parameters) a plausible and pleasing conclusion.<br />Set primarily in Paris, the focus is on Robert Langford and Sophie Neveu as they seek the Holy Grail while struggling to solve a series of puzzles. Their solution of one creates several new, even more complicated puzzles. Meanwhile, their lives are in danger. If they do not crack the Da Vinci Code, they will probably die. The 2,000-year old secret which that code protected will also be lost. Tension builds as clues (true and false) accumulate. Stalked by an assassin, Langford and Neveu are about to complete their quest when....<br />This work of fiction has indeed generated a great deal of controversy. In an article written by Antonio Calanni which appeared in Newsweek magazine, several questions are posed and then answered. For example:<br />Q: Did Leonardo include Mary Magdalene in his \\"Last Supper\\"?<br />A: Most art scholars say no. The figure reputed to be Mary Magdalene is actually the beloved disciple John, who is usually depicted young and clean-shaven.<br />Q: Are Opus Dei and the Priory of Sion real organizations?<br />A: Yes, but there is no indication that either is involved in any plot to conceal or reveal secrets of the Holy Grail.<br />Q: What is the Holy Grail?<br />A: The most widely accepted idea is that it was the cup used by Christ at the Last Supper. Others have hypothesized that it was a secret book. In the 12th century a French abbot claimed to possess it; his silver chalice now resides in the National Gallery of Art in Washington, D.C.<br />Q: Is there a secret cache of documents that reveal the true history of Christianity?<br />A: No one knows, but scholars are busy analyzing ancient documents found in Egypt in the last century. These texts, known as the Gnostic Gospels, were lost for centuries, and could shed new light on the origins of the church.<br />Q: Did Leonardo hide clues about church secrets in his paintings?<br />A: Art historians doubt it.<br />© 2004 Newsweek, Inc.<br />Meanwhile, this novel continues to be a bestseller.

B00006CXXU|5.0|As soon as I heard \\"Genie in a Bottle\\" on the radio quite some time ago, I loved Christina Aguilera. But I was also in the teeniebopper N*SYNC, Britney, Mandy, Backstreet era, so I had no idea what true talent was. I knew she had a good voice and all, and I absolutely loved her first CD. After going to one of her concerts, I was determined I would be a Christina fan forever. After her first CD melted away, and Britney (who I loathe - but I do love Toxic... thats it...) came out with a few more of her crappy CDs, so did N*SYNC and everyone else, everyone kind of forgot about Christina. I still remained a true fan, and before you knew it, Dirrty was all over the place.<br />Of course I immediately went out and bought Stripped. But I was not expecting it to become my most cherished of my CD collection. After listening to the whole CD through, I was in awe. Not only did she show off her amazing voice (what else is new?), but she sang through so many emotions that Britney could never pull off. Some of my favorite titles include \\"Can't Hold us Down\\" (which really shown a new light on girl-power), \\"Walk Away\\" (a beautiful jazzy song), and Soar (the most inspirational song in my opinion). Christina does an amazing job in Stripped, by really stripping down into her bare soul, where all of the listeners got a new appreciation for the wonderful music she has  given to us. Many wonderful types of music, some hip hop, some jazz, some soul, some latino, a little bit of everything. All in all, Christina Aguilera's best. Worth every penny :)
0679428895|4.0|If you go into this book expecting latter-day Tolstoy, you're going to be disappointed. Harris is not reaching for that rung. He's canny enough to understand his mass market audience. That's not really meant, as a knock, however. The fellow can write, and he has clearly done his homework.<br />Sure, the plot is a bit melodramatic and the characters are not exactly three dimensional, but the book's a gas and Harris provides just enough arcana that the reader learns something while hurtling through his/her speedy voyage along the 1st c. Italian coast. I found the information about Roman aqueduct construction and maintenance particularly interesting. Harris had to have done a fair amount of research into the subject, and works his factoids into the novel's exposition rather cannily.<br />As I intimated, the characters are, for the most part, MGM cut-outs, but I did find the author's depiction of Pliny the elder amusingly eccentric. Pliny the younger is depicted as a zit-faced teen, for what reason I don't know. Harris has a grudge for Pliny the younger? The corporate villain, Attilius, however, was lifted straight from the pages of Petronius. The author even acknowledges that Attilius' banquet is basically a reproduction of Trimalchio's famous feast. That's fine, but rather lazy, as well.<br />I recommend this book as a light, breezy read. Not much depth, but highly entertaining.<br />BEK
0385504209|4.0|I will agree with most people's reviews so far, this book is overhyped. I have rolled my eyes a couple times at points, but I wouldn't say that this book is bad. First of all, the facts in the book are pretty accurate. I have studied about the Holy Grail and the religous involvement with it for a couple years now, and Browns research seems to add up pretty well with it. I also read \\"Holy Blood, Holy Grail\\" and noticed some similarities between the two, such as The Priory and the name Sauniere, as well as the Dossier Secrets. But, I think the biggest problem people have with this book is the fact that it isn't very supportative of the Catholic church, and thats a problem. The facts in the book are true, maybe not entirely, but to a good extent, and people just don't want to believe it. Personally, I found a lot of the facts in the book refreshing and actually learned some interesting things. And it was nice to see someone who actually did some research for their book. Brown almost reminds me of Jane Jensen, who does some very similar work, but, Brown is much more interesting to read from. If you want more info on this kind of thing, Holy Blood Holy Grail is good as well as the computer game Gabriel Knight 3: Blood of the sacred, Blood of the damned.
B00006CXXU|4.0|When I initially heard about the release of X-Tina's 2nd album, I was excited because although quite \\"poppy\\", I enjoyed her 1st.  BUT all of that excited anticipation fell off when I heard and saw the video for \\"Dirrty\\".  I truly detested that video and felt that she'd done a \\"Pink\\" - changed up her image & music in order to cater to a different audience.  But then, thank God, someone with common sense ordered the release of \\"Beautiful\\" as the second single and lo & behold, I was excited about her album again.<br />I too have kept this cd in heavy rotation since I got it and feel that X-Tina got gypped in Grammy noms.  This album should have easily gotten a nod for Album of the Year but...whatever the Grammies are pretty much a joke nowadays anyway so she may just have to be glad that such a diverse population love this cd - r&b heads, pop heads, hip hop heads...<br />My fav tracks are: Walk Away, Fighter, Loving Me 4 Me, Impossible, Underappreciated, Beautiful, Cruz, Get Mine, Get Yours & The Voice Within.<br />I hope that people who dismiss X-Tina because of her attitude truly give this disc a listen because it was one of the best releases of 2002.
6304383177|5.0|I give full credit to a bachelor uncle, Harry Johnson, for the fact that I became a movie buff early in my childhood. Throughout the Great Depression, as he repeatedly explained, he escaped from all the financial hardships by attending the local movie theaters on the South Side of Chicago. One of his all-time favorites is this one. You can thus imagine how thrilled he was when I gave him a VCR one distant Christmas, accompanied by VHSs of this film and It's a Wonderful Life. At Christmas and on his birthday, I gave him VHS versions of other films (e.g. Going My Way, Bells of St. Mary, and The Virginian). Whenever I returned to visit him, we would head for his favorite restaurant in Oak Park (Otto's) for a steak dinner, then return to his apartment to watch a movie. More often than not, this was the one he selected. We would settle back with lavishly buttered popcorn and a cold beer and again become enchanted by Bringing Up Baby.<br />Directed by Howard Hawks and co-starring Cary Grant (David Huxley) and Katherine Hepburn (Susan Vance), this is the archetypical screwball comedy. While golfing, Susan falls in love with David, a paleontologist. \\"Baby\\" is her pet leopard. Any summary of the film's plot cannot begin to suggest what a delightful experience it is to observe her pursuit of him, complicated at one point by mistaken identity (stay with me on this) when Baby is mistaken for another leopard which has escaped from the local zoo. Meanwhile, David (stay with me now) pursues a missing dinosaur bone which he needs inorder to....<br />Hepburn and Grant are brilliant, as are several members of the supporting cast, notably Charlie Ruggles (Major Horace Applegate), Barry Fitzgerald (Mr. Gogarty), and May Robson (Aunt Elizabeth). So many memorable scenes. Somehow, Hawks and his cast establish and then sustain zaniness at a high level of sophistication. Can it really be 65 years since this film first appeared? How remarkable that it has lost none of its entertainment value since then. None. Today, how much I wish I could see it again with Uncle Harry. He died years ago but I still have all those fond memories. He and they live on in films such as this.

B00005JLZN|5.0|I am appalled at the negative reactions to this film.  The reviewers have expressed distaste for its politics, for the graphic (but brief) nudity and sex.  But the film is far more about loss than it is about any of these things.  And there are subtle and not-so-subtle ironies throughout. It starts with the reverse-rape:  who really loses their innocence in that bathroom scene? The girl who would do anything? Who is really at the heart of the \\"crime\\" that is the focal point of the movie?  A woman who would do anything? And who loses and who gains because of this?  I found the film moving, philosphical and thought-provoking. It is tragic (alchoholism, cancer), with portrayals of self-sacrifice worthy of more recognition than it has received. The performances weren't stellar, but the unfolding of the several plot and emotional resolutions (endings) was brilliant.  To me, it had the right touch of downplayed performances and quirkiness, with a haunting emotional theme throughout, that is characteristic of David Lynch's better work.

0316666343|4.0|Note: spoilers<br /> I have read through this novel more than once, and I can say it grows stronger each time. Millions of copies, a year and a half on the bestseller lists, and almost two thousand Amazon reviews later, The Lovely Bones keeps on going.<br /> What is it about this novel that has touched so many of us at this particular point in time? The aftermath of 9/11 has been put forth as one explanation, but while that might get a lot of people to open the book, it didn't get them to finish it.<br /> Susie Salmon is but the latest incarnation of a familiar figure in American literature - the youth who never gets sullied by having to grow up, somewhat like Holden Caulfield or Sylvia Plath. The unique twist here is that she gets to watch everyone else grow up and comment on that ... growing up in her own way, as she admits at the end of the book, reaching a final peace with herself on Earth as an absence others must bridge, becoming wise in a way that cannot be measured in years.<br /> As the New York Times admitted in its review, most readers would probably pass, sight unseen, on a first novel in which a 14-year-old murder victim watches her family from heaven. But Sebold almost makes it work for the whole 300+ pages. The only part that doesn't is the \\"Lazarus\\" scene with Ruth near the end. On its own terms, it works fine, but as even Sebold seems to realize it sort of violates the rules of contact between heaven and earth she's established throughout the novel ... everything else seems plausible, assuming of course that you believe in life after death, but then if the dead can not only briefly return to the world but inhabit the bodies of living in order to fulfill unrealized sexual agendas among other things (and let me say that Susie's decision to do that instead of finger Mr. Harvey and pass on where her body is buried actually does seem understandable), why doesn't this happen more often in the real world? Huh?<br /> That said, there's much to admire. It was deft to make this not the story of Susie's life told in flashback from beyond the grave a la Sunset Boulevard, or an accidental removal from life a la Here Comes Mr.Jordan/Heaven Can Wait/that Chris Rock version, but to make Susie's death and ascent to heaven the beginning of the story. I don't find Susie's heaven as insipid as some of the other reviewers seem to; isn't it supposed to be the point that a) it appeals primarily to Susie and b) it's, as in Heaven Can Wait, Defending your Life and other such narratives, but a prelude to the real, wider Heaven that Susie has moved on to at the end of the story? In fact, having grown up in a couple of leafy Northeastern suburbs myself I can say I know exactly where she's coming from. As the radiator woman sang in \\"Eraserhead,\\" \\"in heaven, everything's fine ... you get yours and I get mine.\\"<br /> The rereadings I mentioned above helped close a couple of plot holes that seem to have boggled other people here: how the police link Mr. Harvey to Susie (the fingerprints on the Coke bottle ... his they could have matched with the ones in the house; hers from her birth certificate). I don't think the police as depicted here were necessarily incompetent, just outfoxed by a serial killer with more practice committing the crimes.<br /> It also comes out as you reread just how subtly Sebold charts the changes in Susie, the way her tone moves from impatient teenager to beatific spirit over the course of the narrative, alternating those perspectives constantly as Susie recalls them from her present vantage point somewhere in the blue distance. I like how she creates a sense of omniscience by having Susie often refer in passing to the resolution of certain plot threads that otherwise haven't happened at that point in the story.<br /> This could have just been a puerile attempt to work through her rape experience and deal with her very real fear of death during that; instead she actually managed to write a novel that, in the end, works because all of us have someone we remember in our lives who never got to truly live into adulthood and/or maturity, who remains safely forever young, trapped, like the penguin in the epigraph, in a perfect world, beyond the touch of earthly years, and we'd like to know, just once, how they're doing there.<br /> Surprising that we haven't heard any word on the movie yet other than that Scotswoman supposedly working on the script. There's a lot here that could make a really great film in this particular genre ... let's hope they don't screw it up.
B0000BWVCM|3.0|Granted, I'm coming late to the party, having just viewed X2 for the first time. But I was so frustrated and disappointed with one aspect of the movie, the mishandling of the Cyclops/Scott Summers character, that I was unable to enjoy an otherwise solid effort.  I was initially surprised with the minimal role this character played in Brian Singer's first XMen movie, but understood that because of the exposition required in a first movie, the popularity of the Wolverine character, and the need to appeal to non-comic book fans it was necessary to focus on other areas.  But this is ridiculous.  Cyclops/Summers has an even smaller role in this second movie and is completely emasculated in an effort to make the Wolverine character more appealing.  Has Singer even read the comic book?  The Cyclops/Summers character is the first XMan, is one of the three or four most popular characters over the years and has been more than a match for the Wolverine character; they are perfect foils for each other.  Obviously, Singer needs to please a wider film-going audience, but he also has a responsibility to be true to the source material.  To relegate a complex, dynamic character to an also-ran role is to contradict forty plus years of comics.  X2 teases us with the possibility (likelihood?) of a third movie in the series.  Here would be a good place to right this wrong.  The casting of James Marsden as Cyclops might also merit some reconsideration.  While Marsden does no real wrong, he simply does not have the onscreen presence to match Hugh Jackman, nor does he have any chemistry with Famke Janssen.  In the Cyclops-Jean Grey-Wolverine troika, Marsden is clearly the weak link, and may have something to do with the focus away from his character.  Here's hoping Brian Singer addresses this error and gives the audience a movie that reflects the real XMen.  Third time could be the charm.
B000002LCI|5.0|It contains the autentic Depeche sound, with the gratest songs they ever created. If you never heard any song of Depeche Mode, give a try to this amazing disc, and you will not be disappointed.
B00004Z459|2.0|I remember this album being released back in 2000 and when it came out it was a big seller around my town.  My friend bought the CD and we listened to it.  Not really my type of music but it was ok for what it was.<BR>Then for the next year and a half they played four different songs off Hybrid Theory everyday on the radio.  It drove me nuts and let me tell you when you hear a certain song(s) everyday for over a year it gets real old, real fast.<BR>But.....I must give this album alittle credit.  \\"One Step Closer\\" is really cool a nice song to get up and mosh to.  \\"Cure for the Itch\\" was really weird what they did with the turntables.  And \\"Pushing Me Away\\" was one of those songs were you liked it because of how the song just was.<BR>So in time I never heard any of the songs I liked over the radio and the DJ's at the radio station must of been jerkin off to this album because they played it constantly.<BR>Also the lead singer can not sing, I don't care who says what he can not sing worth of sh*t.  They mix rap and rock together which is NOT GOOD!  When you mix rap and rock like Limp Bizkit you get a toilet full of vomit.  Rap and Rock were never meant to be mixed.<BR>So should you buy this album......Ummmmm......No!<BR>If you do happen to pick up this CD listen to \\"One Step Closer\\" and \\"Pushing Me Away\\" they throw the CD in the trashcan.<br />Linkin Park  ~  2 stars  out of  10 stars
0099279320|4.0|This volume contains two of Puzo's works. I think the first deserves 4.5 stars and the second 3 stars so overall it's about 4.<br />Noone hasn't heard of The Godfather. Almost everyone has seen it. The movies (I and II) have been acclaimed as some of the greatest films of all time. The Godfather in novel form more than lives up to the expectations that in most adaptations the book is better than the movie. The story follows the rise of Michael Corleone as the Don of his mafia family. Michael is an unlikely Don who starts off as a college-graduate and war-hero who is ashamed of his family's illegal ties. But then circumstances changed...<br />The book has one better on what the movie has been accused of - gratuitous length. Godfather I and II are both very long and the attention to detail detracts from the attention spans of the more impatient viewers. But a novel is expected to be long and detailed - in fact it's not too long by literary standards.<br />The book covers Godfather I and parts from II which talk about Vito Corleone's beginnings as an Italian immigrant. It also has many plotlines that aren't in the movies. The greatness of the book is that it creates a whole world of emotion - with the loyalty, betrayals and murders. The book ties in subtle parts of the plot together making you see things that watching the movie aren't at all obvious (like the intentions of certain characters and the motivations for their behaviour). If you liked the Godfather movies at all or are interested in the workings of an Italian crime family at it's grandest, this book is gold.<br />The Fortunate Pilgrim is more of a drama. It tells the story of Lucia Santa - an immigrant widow living in a small appartment in New York and raising her children. This book exposes the reality of the life of immigrant Italians in all it's harshness, with the very tight budgets and subsistent living, domestic violence, a clash between the traditional Italian values and modern American ones, the generation gap and the temptation of crime.<br />This is characterized in Lucia's children. The daughter is an assertive, educated type determined to become big in the real world. One of the sons is a womaniser and all-round good guy. The other sons are archetypes of kids growing up during the depression. A moving, though at times slow book.<br />If you want to see and enjoy the different sides of Puzo as a writer, this novel is ideal.
B0000C9ZLD|4.0|although The Strokes may sound like The Cars, Interpol, Spoon, The White Stripes, etc.  the strokes are about rhythms and repeating melodies and lyrics that soothe you into oblivion and although you may get a high from listening to Jack White sing about voodoo magic the strokes give serious pleasure.  the one stupid song that they tried to make sound like a typical rock song in the beginning of \\"the end has no end\\"  turned me off but i was instatnly turned on by the sheer fact that one of the names of their songs is \\"meet me in the bathroom\\".  but its not about their song names.  you listen to the strokes for the way that they perfected what arty bands like spoon introduced.  you listen to them for the way they make you bob your head and how they don't jarr you awake at 5:00 in the morning when the alarm goes off.  like Metallica does.
B0000VCZK2|1.0|The content is great....I reiterate every great thing others have said. But, what isn't said here is that about 50% of the sets sold are scratched and/or flawed.  They freeze up and are unplayable.  This is why there are SO many used for sale...when the set just released!  Be especially cautious buying used sets. I personally have purchased the 4 individual CEs, and am delighted with them. I do not experience any of the same problems with these as I did with the Quad set.
B0000CAQ27|5.0|I bought this CD yesterday as well actually.  I took today to listen to the CD and I really enjoyed it.  For me Pink represents the glimmer of hope in the pop world, because she isn't afraid to take herself (as a person) to the masses via music.  She doesn't have to try to be [bad]she is genuinely and it comes across in her music.<br />The opening track \\"Trouble\\" is a slice of pop-rock fun, it dissolves quickly after its over, but it was only meant to (in my eyes)be a fun track.  The next song \\"God Is A DJ\\" is a personal favorite.  Lyrically I love how she compares life to music, dancefloors, and DJs. Cool dude.  <br />The track I am really digging is \\"Catch Me While I'm Sleeping\\" is a beautiful lite-RnB number ballad.  Don't be fooled though, not feather weight like the ballads from Can't Take Me Home, this ballad aches, yearns, and pulsates with nothing but sheer emotion.<br />Pink sings, swears, and is just herself on this disc.  You couldn't ask for anything more in a world of fakers.  Don't listen to those comparing it to her last album, it isn't supposed to be a sequel to that.
B000092ZYX|5.0|This most recent release of Radiohead seems at first to be a weak compilation of tracks, but like the best things in life, it seems to be an acquired taste.  The overlying aspect that makes this different from all other Radiohead albums is how personal the music is.  It has its \\"low points\\" (Sit down. Stand up., Where I end and You Begin., The Gloaming.)  Yet like all of their albums, it would not be the same without these.  The highlights are definitely the opening and closing - 2+2=5 is one of the most complex, yet also among the shortest songs that Radiohead has on an album.  A Wolf at the Door., We suck Young Blood., and I will. are some of the most desperate and personal songs I have heard, and are true works of art.  The album also has some impressive use of \\"different\\" sounds - Myxomatosis. and Backdrifts.  Another highlights - Sail to the Moon. - only Radiohead can make such a complex time signature flow.  Overall, another impressive and very different release that is worth the time it takes to appreciate it.
0156012197|5.0|This review refers to the T.V.F Cuiffe translation which I was unable to find on Amazon. I don't know anything about the Howard translation.<br />This amazing book was written supposedly for children and it reads like a children's story. It's also beautifully illustrated. However, it meant much more to me when I reread it as an adult than as a child. I could say the book is an alegory and that it contains much symbolic value but it would debase it's melancholy beauty to attach academic terms to it.<br />The story is about the narrator, a pilot just like the author, being stuck in the Sahara waiting to repair his plane. He meets the little prince who hails from a tiny planet that's not much bigger than him. The book relates his solitary existence at his home, his travels through the other asteroids, inhabited by single individuals such as the Geographer (which can be seen as archetypes) to his arrival on earth culminating in the relationship with the pilot.<br />Again, saying that the book is about life, loneliness, love, friendship and finding one's true nature would be missing the point (one which the book beautifully mentions through the mouth of a fox) that the most important things are not said in words. The book has no \\"themes\\" as such but it's a fully integrated work. The pictures are as important as the text and contain so much kindness, humour and irony (as does the work itself) that this work is an absolute must.
0804106304|1.0|The novel exhibits a one dimensional, Westernized perspective of the often complex Chinese social interactions in particular and East Asian in general. It overtly awashes in sentimenal values in place of balanced objectivity, insults the integrity of a proud tradition, and reinforced pervasive stereotypes of Asian men by dehumanizing them as abusively rigid, asexual misogynist. Conversely, the work generally depicts Chinese women as scheming, sexually submissive victims---a kind of yellow noble savage (ie, Madame Butterfly, Miss Saigon). Western audiences and Asian self-haters may praise it for the novel's allege cultural richness because it reinforces their long held prejudices of those \\"fresh off the boats.\\" However, most Asian male reviewers of this melodrama finds it repugnant and deeply offensive. A work of literary luminary? Think not!
B000059TEQ|5.0|All I can say about this movie is I loved it. Some people may see it is a tad cheesy and not realistic, but I totally disagree. It may be bittersweet towards the end, but that is what truly makes it a great film.
B000088E6D|5.0|Great set of chops on this kid. And what range!! <br />I heard Tony Bennett comment that this kid had it all, and who better to judge? Yes, he has great chops and tremendous vocal control. Powerful. And Good!!
B000062YAZ|3.0|I'm not a thrash fan really but listened to this album cause I have known of Slayer for a long time and what I can say is that this album is really ... fast and heavy . The lyrics are kinda Bad \\"B\\" horror movie type and aren't really sung as much as shouted  ,that is when you can understand them . The true highlights of this album for me are the awesome speed of King's and Hamerien's guitar's and the powerful uncomparable drumming of Dave Lombardo , all in all this album is worth a listen if you're a hard rock/metal fan You just might suprise yourself but for me this album is about 1 thing Serious Speed other than that is doesn't do to much else .
0385474547|5.0|Achebe has spun a classic tale of redemption and tragedy which takes<br />place in the Nigerian village of Umuofia. Readers learn of the tribal<br />rituals and traditions of the Ibo tribe through the eyes of the<br />tragic hero Okonkwo. Okonkwo is obsessed with rising above the<br />shameful legacy his father has bestowed upon the family. He  becomes<br />a champion wrestler, prolific farmer and a stern  husband of three<br />wives and many children. In the eyes of the villagers this gives him<br />respect and importance, redeeming him against the deeds of his<br />father. Yet, there is a dark side to our hero, as a result of his<br />pursuit of acceptance.<br />Okonkwo becomes a cruel man to his wife and children, demanding near<br />perfection from them, so that he is never disgraced. Ironically, it<br />is through a tragic chain of events that he disgraces himself. After<br />years of banishment Okonkwo reenters Nigerian society under British<br />rule. No longer are rituals, traditions and the religion of the<br />forefathers honored. Okonkwo must come to terms with reclaiming<br />respect and importance in a land that has left the old ways behind<br />and is slowly spinning into chaos.<br />Achebe gives the reader a rare glimpse into a pre-colonial Nigeria<br />that is both brutal and beautiful;a Nigeria that had respect for its<br />people and their way of life. THINGS FALL APART is slowly paced, and<br />some readers may become frustrated with flipping to the glossary to<br />find the meaning of some Ibo words. However, the novel is well<br />written and constructed.  Readers who venture into this tale are<br />given a unique glimpse into a traditional African hero standing tall<br />against the onset of Western influence. A special treat.<br />Reviewed by Raven James<br />of The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers
B0000C7GG2|4.0|absolution is a fresh new rock album from an original band that obviously know their instuments well. the lyrics have gone really downhil since their debut, they seem lifeless and unoriginal like they have taken lyrics from the scrapbook of showbiz and put them together in this album, only a minor fault seen as the singing in this album pushes the listener to sing these lyrics, maybe that was the plan all along, make catchy melodies and people will sing along even if the lyrics are a bit underaverage. as long as i can sing along and enjoy the music it's all good. a good all round nicely textured album with catchy lead guitar and bass (!) pulled together by some well thought out drumming. a nice step up from the over-rated OOS, on a par with showbiz.
B0000DD7LB|4.0|I've always been a mixed Britney fan. I like some of her songs, dislike others. I thought her 3rd CD was somewhat of a disappointment, with only a few songs I found enjoyable. But this CD...well, I think it's very different. If Britney was just beginning to shed her true light in her 3rd CD and this is the REAL Britney...I definitely love the real Britney. 'Me Against the Music' is definitely a very catchy and fun single. 'Toxic' (one of my favorites) is very trancy and different. 'Breathe On Me' is a more sexual Britney while 'Everytime' is so different, a haunting ballad of Britney's pain. From the Chinese instruments in 'Touch of my Hand' to the high-tempo beats of 'Outrageous' this is a very enjoyable CD and one of Britney's best. I did have some dislikes about this CD. First of all, I think the Ying Yang Twins in \\"I Got That (Boom Boom)\\" are unnecessary...cut them out. Other than that the only setback I think is that, well...I wish Britney would use real instruments more often. Don't get me wrong, it isn't call computer sounds but lots of it is...that just annoys me. I mean, I love 'Toxic', but there's a lot of fake sounds in it...I just wish Britney would use more real instruments. Still a great CD.<br />Favorites:<br />Me Against the Music<BR>Breathe on Me<BR>Toxic<BR>Everytime<BR>Outrageous<BR>Touch of My Hand
B00005JM0B|3.0|The truth is that this is not a bad movie, but it isn't really a great movie either. The script could have been better, but it did bring up some interesting questions. John Connor and Katherine Brewster's relationship could have been a lot more involved, but at least the writers didn't have them go too far and have a sex scene. Sure the Terminator wasn't as cool in this one as in the others, but come on Arnold is getting old. There is a lot of stuff like that in the movie, but the action is cool and you've got to give it that. I don't think that movies should be judged by how much action there is, but it works for a movie like this. So, basically it isn't as good as the first two by a long shot, but it's okay. And if you're like me and you love the first two and feel like you need to buy it so that you can complete the trilogy feel free to. You won't watch it as much as you do the other two, but you might just watch a few times a year.
0790736039|1.0|The book \\"It\\" is absolutely wonderful and very humorous in my opinion. You just fall in love with the characters. This movie is absolutely awful compared to the book. First of all, I hated the characters,they were nothing like the book and second of all they MADE A MOCKERY OF EDDIE'S DEATH. Movies have to leave out a lot of things, especially when the book is so full of information, but the movie left out the ritual of chud, which is how they really killed the monster and the house on neibolt street, which i think is just awful. If you want a movie that will put you right to sleep, go for it. This movie was not scary at all!!!
B00005JMTQ|5.0|Any Diane Keaton (or Jack Nicholson, for that matter) fan HAS to see this.  She just keeps getting better.  And the plot is one of those like the \\"Cathy\\" comic - mimics life perfectly.  Mahvelous movie!
0783225849|5.0|This movie ranks as one of my alltime Alfred Hitchcock movies that I have ever seen.Anthony Perkins plays the role of Norman Bates. He turns out to be the central character in this movie.<br />A woman has stolen money from a company and escaped to the countryside.She is killed after she stays at the motel ran by Norman Bates and his mother.The fright factor is racheted up several notches after the killing of the girl.In typical Alfred Hitchcock style the ending to a frightening conclusion. the ending of this movie is an all time stopper that you will not forget.I still consider this movie to be an alltime classic.<br />Watch this movie and you will never forget it.I love Alfred Hitchcock.
6302468027|5.0|This is a great movie. I think it is Kathy Bates best movie and I love Jessica Tandy in it. Is Jessica the older Mary Stuart Masterson? Tandy is telling Bates about her life when she was young and what was going on in her town when she was young. Wonderful movie.
B00009V7P8|4.0|Overall this album is pretty good.  Rice's voice, with that nice Irish accent, flows well on most songs.  His female companion that appears on a few tracks has a hauntingly beautiful voice.  If you enjoy the sample tracks on Amazon you'll love the CD.  If you aren't quite sure that you like him from the samples you're better off skipping this one.  Most of the CD is reminscent of moody singer-songwriters, but it's worth the money.
B00006CXXU|5.0|Actually, a few months ago, I wrote a review here and gave this CD just one star. I had listened only one song - Dirrty and though the song was catchy, the video put me off. And everytime I saw any other video of hers, I never gave it a chance and switced channels everytime I saw her face on T.V. That's how I missed  'Fighter' and Beauiful. I got this CD because I had got Britney's In the Zone too and I decided to critisice them both together. <BR>I fell in love with every damn song on the CD and I couldn't get Fighter off my mind. <BR>The lyrics are good, her tunes  are good and her voice is so very powerful. The only thing I don't like about her is her approach. The Stripped intro tells you everything. She's trying to tell people that she's everything Britney wasn't and her main goal doesn't seem to be only making good music. It's making music better than Britney. <BR>Anyhow, this album is a must buy. I cannot imagine how anyone could give it one star. 'Fighter' and Beautiful are worth two times the price! I luv them!!!!
B00006JKOL|2.0|Well, after debating for a year or so, I finally crossed my fingers and ordered this. No luck; burned again. Ian Anderson does not seem even to be trying.<br />The odd thing about this recording is that its \\"bonus tracks\\" are much better than the real album cuts. I mean especially \\"March, the Mad Scientist\\", but I also mean even the live abridgements. The live arrangements and performances are only slightly different, but they are mercifully brief.
B00008977N|2.0|The poor quality of this DVD is unworthy of Peter Gabriel, his musicians, Robert Lepage and this amazing show.  Nothing less !  I could do a better job with my own DVD recorder.  The technical team responsable of that should be dismissed.  It's awful to discover that such a great artists like that are so badly disserved.  Deeply sorry for Peter, his fans around the world and for me.
B00006IU73|5.0|i thought the world we lived in was filled with crappy music and wannabe musicians. then my best friend (shout out to my boy christian for getting this for me) got this cd for me as a christmas present because he had heard i had a sudden love for \\"REAL MUSIC.\\" i had gotten radiohead's \\"ok computer\\" which was awesome. he got this for me as a \\"surprose\\" and said it was probably a risk getting it for me. i was like...oh lord. then i played it...THIS ALBUM IS AWESOME!!!!!!! i didn't know record companies and record stores allowed REAL music to be sold. it has a little touch of everything, EVERYTHING. this is what a rock cd should be like. this album will appeal to lovers of music. not genre culting fools, REAL music lovers. this album cannot even be placed in any genre, it should be in a genre of it's own called \\"REAL ROCK MUSIC!\\" or just \\"REAL MUSIC!\\" this album has melody, hard riffs, weird sounds, true musicianmanshipworkethicalloveforlife. this album has everything you could ever ask for in a rock album. you can play this album anywhere, anytime, any mood, any situation, there is a song for it. that's how good this album is. this is the album you'd want to be buried alive with. the lyrics are deep, and nice. they are meaningful, they took thought in writing the music. you will LOVE this album, if not, then there is something wrong with you!
B000002L9Y|5.0|Tango In The Night was something really special for lots of reasons.  The hits (\\"Big Love\\", \\"Seven Wonders\\", \\"Little Lies\\", and \\"Everywhere\\") were done right because those songs are well-constructed.  That means that the songs are enjoyable and easy to listen.  They took five years in between albums, but it was well worth the wait.  Even the front album cover would be a type of picture I would hang on my wall!<br />Thus, it would make this album their best since \\"Rumours\\" because I always felt that \\"Tusk\\" and \\"Mirage\\" could of been better.  I would recommend this album to all fans of Fleetwood Mac.
B0000DJZA5|1.0|>Well, McCartney was a Beatle, and Spector wasn't, so I think McCartney's version is better and lives up to the \\"this is the way it was ment [sic] to be,\\" because this was how it was ment [sic] to be. Get what I'm saying? <br />Paul McCartney was *a* Beatle; he was NOT *The Beatles*, and it's time he stopped pretending to be. If the Beatles had meant \\"Let It Be\\" as you find it here, they would have released \\"Let It Be\\" as you find it here. They didn't. Get what I'm saying?<br />The Beatles disbanded thirty-three years before Naked's release when their leader and founder, John Lennon, quit. The Beatles never had any intention of reforming, and one-half of The Beatles are now *dead*. <br />No, Phil Spector was not a Beatle. Like George Martin, Phil Spector was a *record producer*. He happens to have been *the* record producer *Beatle* John Lennon chose to turn the paltry scraps of what was to become \\"Let It Be\\" into something palatable. John was well-satisfied with the result. John Lennon went on to choose Phil Spector to produce his next two solo albums, the classics \\"Plastic Ono Band\\" and \\"Imagine\\", just as George Harrison, a *Beatle*, went on to choose Phil Spector to produce his next solo album, the classic \\"All Things Must Pass\\". It was, and remains, perfectly within Paul McCartney's legal and ethical right (they aren't necessarily the same thing) to re-record any or all of the songs here (including the John Lennon and George Harrison songs) and release his recording *under his own name*. (This, of course, would be a dubious enterprise *aesthetically*, and even so, putting this circumstance aside, the result would have to be judged according to whatever merit it might possibly possess.)<br />Calling Paul McCartney on his lies is not \\"bashing\\". That these lies are lies is an objective fact, documented and verifiable.<br />(By the bye, the inveterate Sir-ers here, those who can't resist the appellations Sir Mick, Sir Elton, Sir Bob, and Sir Paul, should remember that England's greatest twentieth-century composer--arguably--, Ralph Vaughan Williams, turned down his knighthood, as did Aldous Huxley, the author of \\"Brave New World\\", and many other Englishmen much more worthy of recognition than the pop stars mentioned above. Speaking of pop stars, however, David Bowie recently turned down his C.B.E.--Commander of the British Empire--, and John Lennon, of course, turned in his M.B.E.)
0440241413|4.0|All I can say about this novel is that it's just plain fun! It has this awesome paradox between a spending addiction and financial aid. Rebecca Bloomwood is a young, sexy, shopaholic (go figure) who takes a little too much joy in spending her well earned bucks into enormous debt that she earns as a financial journalist (contradiction much?). Delightful? Clever? It's both. Rebecca's hillarious and sometimes just plain mornoicaly stupid behavior is both thrilling and scrumptious. As she roams from shop to shop racking up every girl's common boutique obsessions you're thinking at the same time \\"No! Put it down.\\" and \\"Oh god, I want this!\\". She constantly digs herself deeper when trying to get her way out of her problems which just makes you want to laugh and cry at the same time. This novel takes you through a dramatic and stressful journey through every possible pitfall and dilemna that once the deliciously satisfying conclusion comes along, you feel as if you've just been right by Becky's side going through it all with her. This novel is a flavorful, guilty-pleasure with a swift under-toe on finance. It is perfect for shopaholics everywhere!
B00005Q4CS|4.0|Addiction-what it is, what is does, who it affects, how it progresses, and how it feels is very hard conceive-especially for somebody who has never suffered from an addiction or been close to someone who has. Requiem for a Dream is not a documentory or historicaly acurate depiction of drug use. What it is, is a graphic, shocking, disturbing, and most of all-VERY REAL-representation of addiction, through the eyes of an addict. I know this because I used drugs and alcohol for more than 20 years, in the end I nearly  completly destroyed myself and I caused great pain and undue suffering to my family with my addiction to cocaine . I am not what the general population perceives as a drug addict. I live in a small town in the upper Midwest. I have a wife and two children and make about $30,000/yr. Few knew of my use. I was selling drugs to support my own habit, and yet ended up more than $20,000 in debt from just credit cards. I know what a \\"road to nowhere,\\" irrational, out-of-control, empty and sickening feeling addiction is. Requiem for a Dream portrays this feeling in a way words could not begin to decribe. I have been clean and sober for seven years, but after I viewed Requiem, I emotionally broke down as memories came flooding back. This is not a movie for entertainment. If you want to know what an addiction is like (especially to highly addictive drugs like heroin, cocaine, or amphetamine)see this movie. If you think \\"that will never happen to me,\\" watch this movie again and see how you will give up ANYTHING and EVERYTHING as your whole life revolves around ONE thing-to obtain that chemical and use it. This movie is so good, I will never watch it again.
B00008K7AM|5.0|Really good movie, also really great acting from Rob Schneider, and also very hot chicks, especially(don't know if u write it like that)Anna Faris. I can't believe that any1 could give this 1 star, if u can't laugh with this movie than u'r humorless.
630018403X|5.0|This is one of my all-time favorites. This teen drama gives a steemingly accurate portrayal of high school stereotypes and images. It is the story of 5 teenage strangers from oposite ends of Shermer High who meet in a day of saturday detention. In the duration of the day they find salvation in eachothers differences while breaking by the brick walls of conformity. It will appeal to everyone; the athlete, the princess, the brain, the basket-case and the criminal. This is one of John Hughes' finnest!

It diserved 2 stars from me because of the special effects where nice. And Jada Pinkett is hot, ow yeah also nice car that she is driving. And the scene where everybody is dancing like monkeys for like 5 minutes?? What was that all about????
B00006RINF|5.0|Hey....ya, this CD is pretty dope! I bought it just the other day, and damn! This is some real metal man! I never thought that Italian band could do metal, I mean, I've been waiting for it, and they pull it off! And by the way, for all you people comparing them with evanescence, stop! They are nothing like Evanescance! Lacuna is Metal, Evanescance is pop! oh, and by the way, Christina Scabbia, she's amazingly hot!
B00005JM4Z|4.0|I think this movie is actually good, nothing wrong with it. Only the last jump was really unrealistic, but hey it's a movie for something (cause u can't do stuff like that in real life). Fast n furious 1 was a 5 for me, but i think they could have chosen a better car than the Lancer Evo, not that it's ugly but there r whay much nicer cars. Anyway, still a good movie.

0440213525|3.0|I find it a little too incredulous for an 11-yr old kid to outwit the might of the judicial system and law enforcement agencies. <br />While Muldanno and his cronies were debating whether Mark knew the secret, they could have moved the body first thing as a precaution. The Mafia could not be that stupid or they did not belong to the Mafia. <br />Mark was so afraid to divulge the location of the body that he even defied Judge Harry but yet towards the end, he was suddently so brave as to look for the body himself and insisted on doing that even with the Mafia digging up the body!<br />I thought the ending was a little weak with Reggie making all sorts of demands and the FBI having to satisfy them.
B0000DD7LB|5.0|I'm an older fan, who's more than a little amazed that someone nearly a decade younger than me could put forth such an incredible, impressive album--and I'm not easily impressed!!  \\"In The Zone\\" is even better than \\"Britney\\"; it has a very mature, eclectic feel.  If you only liked Britney for her early bubblegum pop music, then you probably won't like this album; she's evolved far past such simplistic tunes and you probably won't understand where she's coming from now.  She's grown up and the varied dance styles here reflect that; the album does have a strong \\"Ray of Light\\" vibe but in a way that is strictly Britney despite the obvious impact her idol Madonna has had on her.      Some of the tracks which stand out in particular are:    \\"Me Against the Music\\"--a very strong, classic club song, worthy of being the first single and one of the best dance songs I've ever heard(and I've heard a lot!!);     \\"Early Mornin'\\"--gives an autobiographical feel as well, that partying is fine but too much of a good thing is still too much;      \\"Toxic\\"--the second single, a wild, trippy dance song which voices every girl's inner desire to get her fill of a bad boy--or get rid of a cheating lover(if you've seen the video);      \\"Breathe on Me\\"--accurately described as \\"atmospheric\\",  a trance-y song where two people don't need to get down and dirty to get their freak on,  just being near one another is aphrodisiac enough;      \\"Touch of My Hand\\"--may have the immature giggling due to its subject matter, but it has a great Middle-Eastern vibe throughout and is also very atmospheric.      All in all, a great album, one worthy of being nominated in any category for any award show applicable and I hope when it's eligible that it does receive both  the nominations and accolades it deserves.  Also, my compliments to Miss Britney Spears for singing(yes, she can) differently for each song, using her voice in myriad ways instead of always singing nasally as she did so often with her first two albums.  That was fine, but limiting; now that she sings according to each song's individual flavor, she'll have her vocal skill evolve as well, to her advantage.  Madonna took singing lessons to improve and strengthen her vocal abilities for her movie \\"Evita\\"; Britney should do likewise--not to learn how to sing, but to learn to sing better and improve her range.  Good luck to you Britney--this is one music fan who's glad you've grown up, even if no one else wants to let you.
0345440900|1.0|Hindsight really is 20/20.  Looking back, I really regret reading this book.  This woman taught me to ignore every maternal instinct I had in an attempt to follow her ridiculous schedules.  She claims to be middle-of-the-road, but is really just another sleep trainer.  The book is written in a very annoying, condescending tone, that discounts common sense.  As a first time mom, you feel worthless reading her advice, then even more worthless when her advice doesn't work.  Beware of anyone who tells you that holding your baby will spoil her.  You cannot spoil a baby with too much love.  Of course, I found out too late in the game that the author's credentials were mostly fabricated (Newsweek 2001) and that her own husband thought she was a terrible, neglectful mother.  It's not surprising that her only reviews came from celebrities.  If you don't want to be inconvenienced by a baby, you shouldn't have had one, but this book may be for you.  For anyone else who wants to love and nurture their baby, go with more reliable and realistic information from Sears or Dr. Jay Gordon.  These guys REALLY know babies!  If you insist on reading this book, at least discuss the information with your pediatrician before you start.  She gives terrible feeding advice, and you should definitely get a second opinion before starting her training.
B000003TA4|5.0|Nirvana's second album \\"Nevermind\\" is one of the greatest albums of all time because it has so much variety and energy put into it. \\"Smells Like Teen Spirit\\" is arguably one of the best rock songs of all time and it's actually my favorite song. Kurt throws so much energy into that song it just makes you love it. Now Nirvana is a band with an extreme amount of talent but I have to say they are overrated. You have to remember that they only had 3 cds if you don't include \\"Incesticide\\". Now they were all great CDs but thats enough to be claiming them one of the greatest bands of all time and what not. Kurt Cobain is an excellent singer and guitar player, Dave Grohl is one of the best drummers I've ever heard as well. You can see how much talent Nirvana had if the drummer was talented enough to start up his own band and be the lead guitarist and singer AND be a great band(Foo Fighters). Now I'm sick and tired of everyone fighting over Peral Jam and Nirvana and whos better, they are BOTH great bands and its too hard to say which is better. And Pearl Jam might of come first but that doesnt mean Nirvana had tremendous talent. I think Pearl Jam might have the edge because they have more CDs, now Nirvana can't help that they dont have more Cds obviously because of Kurt's horrifying death but I will say that Nirvana seemed to have more talent than Pearl Jam(sorry hardcore Nirvana hating Pearl Jam fans) and the reason why Nirvana had the spotlight over Pearl Jam is because Kurt was such an interesting person and was full of surprises and was such a talented individual. Now Pearl Jam did prove that being on MTV and getting all the attention doesn't mean your better because Pearl Jam's record titled \\"Ten\\" sold more than Nirvana's \\"Nevermind\\". But this album \\"Nevermind is an amzing album and should be bought right away if you like rock music in general because anybody can like this. Every song on this cd is great which is hard to do. It's sad that Kurt passed away because he wassuch a role model and he kept rock music alive and once he went away it seemed like rock n roll just seemed to slowly creep away......
0316666343|2.0|I was so pyched to read The Lovely Bones. But after the first chapter I was bored. I was in love with hearing Susies sadness and humor throughout the book but I was deeply confused. I had to stop reading the book because it got to be too much. I dont want to give away the ending but one word..whoah! I dont really recommend this book to anyone who cant stand blood, horror, and sadness. If you really want to read a book that makes you think and makes you worship your still living The Lovely Bones is the book for you.
B00008H2LB|4.0|I got Linkin Park's first cd \\"Hybrid Theory\\" and I loved it and so did millions of other people. Linkin park created their own sound so when you heard one of their songs you said \\"hey thats Linkin Park.\\" \\"Hybrid Theory\\" was one of the greatest albums of the 90s and gave hope to future rock so I was really looking forward to their second installment \\"Meteora.\\" Now this isn't a bad CD at all but sometimes it feels like im listening to one big song. It wasn't really like this for \\"Hybrid Theory\\", all of the songs sounded very different. The song \\"Runaway\\" from HT sounds almost exactly like \\"Figure.09\\" from Meteora. And a lot of the songs just sound so similar. But there are still different and fantastic songs on this album like the song \\"Faint\\" is amazing the beat is great the rapping is great and I usually like the songs with rapping, \\" Faint may be my favorite Linkin Park song with Crawling at number 2.\\"Somewhere I Belong\\" is a standout track with a good chorus and great ending. \\" Lying From You\\" is a good song in my opinion with a great chorus and cool beat. \\"Numb\\" is a Linkin Park classic and is arguably the best Linkin Park song. \\"From the Inside\\" is a standout track even though it sounds familiar it has a good chorus. \\"Don't Stay\\" is a good song except it sounds so familar to \\"One Step Closer\\" from HT. A lot of people don't like the song \\"Nobody's Listening\\" because of the strange beat but I love the beat and the chorus. Linkin Park is a popular band that has a lot of potential and I'm hoping to hear something different from them on their third album. Chester Bennington makes this band good he has a great voice and can scream just as good as anybody. I could do without the rapping but I guess it does make the band \\"different\\" from the rest. If I were to buy \\"Hybrid Theory\\" or \\"Meteora\\" I would buy HT, \\"Meteora\\" may be a little bit on the harder side but not by much. You have give this band credit because of their trademark sound, hopefully they go away from thatsound for their 3rd cd though.
B00008NRLX|5.0|If you're like me and have been pretty bored with most of the new releases coming around nowadays, I highly recommend this album.  I purchased it on a whim, along with a bunch of other CDs.  I always buy more music than I can reasonably listen to because I like to keep alot of fresh stuff coming in.  This CD has been in my player constantly, it is simply that good.  The melodies, playing and songs are crafted with excellence.  I don't know about all the dragging at the end, I think this album actually plays quite nicely through its duration.  Tampa to Tulsa (#12) is an excellent song and really conveys a powerful emotional story of a man on a bus ride awaiting the end of his trip where he plans to propose to his future wife (and the uncertainty of a yes answer included.)  \\"Ease my worried mind and take my hand.\\"  It reminds you powerfully of those impacting and definitive moments in your life where the entire world pivots on the outcome of a small set of decisions.  Simply great music that you will connect to and listen to often, check it out.
B0000DD7NL|5.0|alicia is off the hook on this jam.you don't know my name is t.o.o.o. nasty! especially when she start the talking part.and that background vocals.sounds like a choir.those vocals are the best.
B000002UDB|5.0|Probably the Beatles's most underrated and psychedelic album, MMT has it all. The title track is one of the Beatles's best hard rock songs that slows down until the jazzy finish. Other than George's slow and wierd song \\"Blue Jay Way\\", the album is near perfect. \\"Your Mother Should Know\\" is another one of Paul's catchy songs and yet, it's very melodic. \\"Fool on the Hill\\" is another Paul beauty that's absolutely pleasant with a light, but sad lyrics. A beautiful flute and 12-string guitar part can be heard on that. And what can't be said about John's eerie, wierd, psychedelic \\"I Am the Walrus.\\" It's based on the Lewis Carrol poem from \\"Alice in Wonderland\\", but it actually has no meaning whatsoever. At the end, you can hear the words \\"Bury my body\\" and \\"Oh, Untimely death.\\" Are these clues of Paul's death? Actually, their snips of a production of Shakespeare's King Lear which was on the radio at that time. \\"Baby You're a Rich Man\\" is yet another brilliant number. George Martin (their genius producer) said that the single \\"Penny Lane/Strawberry Fields Forever\\" was the greatest rock album EVER. How true. Paul's incredible bass line as well as beautiful British melodies and harmonies shine on \\"Penny Lane\\". \\"SFF\\" stands as one of John's most brilliant songs as it combines his genius lyrics with a haunting, heartbreaking melody. And then there's \\"All You Need is Love\\", one of the greatest songs of all time. When the Beatles were asked to write a song for the first worldwide live television event, they needed a song that could be understood in every country. This song brought it. This album had three number one hits (and would have had four if \\"Strawberry Fields\\" wasn't knocked away by Englbert Humperdink's stupid song back in the sixties). Four out of eleven ain't bad. The most overlooked album, it doesn't quite work as a whole like \\"Sgt. Pepper\\", but is a must-have for Beatles and non-Beatles fans alike.
B000062X9B|5.0|Johnny Cash's third album for American Recordings was another great one.  This time it was an all acoustic affair.  This was the first album he recorded after his serious health problems, and his voice was somewhat weaker than it had been.  But the shakiness in his voice just adds to the poignancy of the performance.  Johnny was always a great interpreter of songs, and as he got older, he got even better.  I recommend this album to all of John's fans.
0679428895|5.0|Pompeii by Robert Harris has received some excellent reviews, and it was on the strength of these that I decided to read the book.  I was not disappointed. Mr. Harris does have the gift of giving his reading the feel of a place and time.  He breathes life into the late first century and presents the many facts and customs in a way that sparks interest and not boredom.  The novel begins on August 22, 79 CE, and the chapters are cleverly organized following the Roman hours of the day and also give the actual hour when the events are taking place.  Each chapter is prefaced with an excerpt from a technical work on volcanology that provides the reader with an idea of the activity going on inside Mount Vesuvius.  <br />The story revolves around the Aqua Augusta, an aqueduct that the protagonist of the story, Marcus Attilius Primus, first becomes the aquarius (the person responsible for maintaining the structure) of the aqueduct and then searches for a break that prevents the flow of water to the drought stricken countryside.   Atillius is a noble character, an imperial official who takes pride in his work and is incorruptible.  But he is now in the self-proclaimed city-on-the-make: Pompeii.<br />Along the way we meet Ampliatus, a wealthy freedman who is, ironically, marrying his daughter to Popilius, his old master.  Ampliatus represents a long line of uncouth and ambitious freedmen that came to dominate the principate in the early empire under Claudius and Nero.  Mr. Harris paints a probing and revealing portrait of Ampliatus and draws an inevitable comparison with Trimalchio of Petronius' Satyricon, with the freedman presiding over a similar overly sumptuous banquet Ampliatus.  As a classicist, I found the banquet scene a little too reminiscent of the novel by Petronius.  The characterization was a little too close and I did not want a parody of that famous literary banquet scene.  However, I think Mr. Harris more than makes up for identifying his character so closely with Petronius by giving him a darker and more ruthless side.  <br />Ampliatus' daughter Corelia is the conscience that her father does not have.  She is a teenager of marriageable age and chafes under the ruthless nature of her father and her own helplessness before her own loveless marriage.  The novel presents an interesting portrait of Pliny the Elder that I found captured his interest in the world around him and his battle of filling his days with as much activity as possible.  We also have the embittered Corax; the overseer of the men who maintain the aqueduct, an enemy of Attilius, who is ready to do anything to get rid of the \\"new man in town.\\" <br />A central part of the story is the mysterious disappearance of Atillius' predecessor Exomnius.  Is he alive or dead?  Little by little Attilius pieces together Exomnius' background and his association with Ampliatus, a revelation that places his life in jeopardy.  In the background is Vesuvius.  We know the catastrophe that is about to happen and look on as the trembling of the earth raises the curiosity of Pliny and the rumblings of the volcano remind people of thunder and giants.  <br />Pompeii is a well-conceived novel that presents a plausible story populated with flesh-and-blood characters.  It is a fast-paced book that is a joy to read; a book that is hard to put down, and a must read for people interested in ancient history or who find the city of Pompeii a fascinating place.
B00005JN02|5.0|I am not German, yet there were such moving moments in the movie I was on the brink of tears, and there were also some scenes where u have the most innocent and \\"justified\\" laugh while there are still tears in your eyes. A must see movie.
B000059T5O|5.0|Since the day this disc came into my life, it's consistently been one of my faves for those \\"what's it all mean\\" kinda moods. There is true wisdom in Tom Waits's wordplay, and true power in the thumping, thudding skronk that backs it up. It's heavier than rock and deep as Dylan. I can picture John sitting in a half-lit bar somewhere in the middle of a crowded city on a rainy night, howling these offbeat blues poems to an audience of a dedicated few hipsters. I could only hope I'd be worthy enough to get a seat in there.
B00008H2LB|5.0|I'm sick of people saying this band sucks. I'm sick of people saying they are the best band ever. I'm sick of them getting so much attention. I'm sick of them becoming so damn popular it's all you ever hear about on the rock scene. I'm sick of people spazing whenever one of their songs are played at parties. But get this... once again, ANOTHER FANTASTIC ROCK ALBUM from Linkin Park. <br />Let me guess, You think I'm another one of those cliched rock fans that only like whats big and hot, like most people who like LP are. Guess what, I'm not. I'm a deep music lover who looks at music from all sides, not just \\"'Cause it sounds good\\". <br />Here we go, Track listing.<br />1. Foreword - (Unrated) - I'm not going to rate this because it's just the opening, and 13 seconds long. Blends right into the next track.<br />2. Don't Stay - (4/5) - A powerful opening track, nothing really special, but a good way to open the album. A good flow between the rap/rock versus, and a catchy harder chorus.<br />3. Somewhere I Belong - (5/5) - A very well made song. Very catchy and flows nicely. Lyrically great, and musically well put together. The first single is the perfect song for that honor. It has a nice feeling with a catchy chorus. <br />4. Lying From You - (5/5) - Another well made rap/rock song with a nice transition into the chorus. Chester's vocal work stands out in this track and shows that he can still sing.<br />5. Hit The Floor - (4/5) - Another fairly harder rap/rock song with a harder chorus. At first, I didn't get into this song, but it grows on you. <br />6. Easier To Run - (5/5) - An amazing song with a set-up much like Crawling. Starts with the chorus (which, like Crawling, is very screamy, yet mellow at the same time) Then goes into a slower song with a nice flow. Mike's section of this song is awesome, and lyrically one of the best parts of the album. <br />7. Faint - (4/5) - Someone explain to me why this was the second single, while it isn't a bad song, it sure isn't as great as it could be. A powerful rocker with a powerful chorus. It is pretty much the cliche mosh-pit song. Nothing special, but catchy.<br />8. FIgure.09 - (4/5) - This song was on the movie S.W.A.T. but not for long. A very well peiced together song, which would probably have been named Part Of Me, but that song title was already taking by one of their older songs. A good song, and fits well where it is on the album.<br />9. Breaking The Habit - (5/5) - Now THIS is one hell of a song. It's got a nice slow flow to it and concentrates more on Chester's vocals and the actually guitar work instead of all the beeping and production this cd is known for. This song is amazing and nothing like the rest of the album, yet it fits perfect.<br />10. From The Inside - (5/5) - A great peaceful flowing verse goes into a fairly powerful scream-styled chorus. This song has the potential to be a single.<br />11. Nobody's Listening - (4/5) - Half the time, nobody's listening to this song either. It's a little less rock then most of the songs on the album, but it has a good flow to it. The style of the chorus is different and the beats in the background fit well with LP's style.<br />12. Session - (3/5) - This track pretty much shouldn't have been on the album. It's an instrumental, but no where NEAR as good as Cure For The Itch off Hybrid Theory was. This song is pretty much only in to transfer the music from Nobody's Listening to...<br />13. Numb - (6/5) - ...NUMB! By far the best song on the album, and possibly LP's best song. Why this song was released for radio play is anyones guess. While it easily could sell the cd by itself, it could end up being overplayed and become annoying, so WHY RUIN THIS SONG! It's a slow song with a powerful feel to it and a perfect way to end the album. The lyrics are some of LP's best, and this song just goes to show that LP is not just the annoying rap-rock band half the world seems to want them to be. <br />All and All a great album, it seems a little over-produced, meaning to much of it is bleeps and sound effects, and there isn't enough guitar and drum work, which can get annoying. But it's a well made album, and Chester's voice carries most of it.
B000002552|5.0|Call me crazy, but for my money, this is the best rock n roll album of all time. It nudges out more obvious choices (\\"Abbey Road,\\" \\"Revolver,\\" \\"Exile on Main Street\\") and more cult-classic picks (\\"Pet Sounds,\\" the first two Big Star albums, London Calling), and even tops the Dylan catalog so far as I am concerned. Why? For one thing, it's raw, real, and gritty, something all too lacking in many mainstream rock releases. For another, it's got a sense of humor. Again, all too rare in post-Beatles rock, where the serious side of angst gets explored ad nauseum. For me, this is everything that the Beatles \\"Get Back\\" sessions should have been but weren't. It's a band goofing off, having fun, not trying to impress anyone, being quirky and downright weird at times. It's got all the down-home feel of the blues and early rock, with deep insight and wit. Have doubts? Listen to \\"Bessie Smith\\"- a timeless classic that says more in a few lines than many authors say throughout the course of whole novels. So what are you waiting for-- if this isn't in your collection, you are missing out, my friend. Missing out.
B00005OMTT|5.0|I finally purchased my first Enigma cd, received it a week ago and cannot take it out of my stereo! I purchased it after reading all of the reviews and I love it. Sadeness is definitely my favorite track although I have that song on one of my Pure Moods cd's which is where I first heard Enigma. <br />I have all of the Pure Moods cd's and love how they give me a taste of the best of everything but everytime I hear Enigma I was drawn to their music. It's just beautiful, I couldn't be happier with this cd.
B00008NG5V|5.0|All I can say is...WOW.  Jack Johnson's music is so fresh and so necessary right now for all the people who are stressed out with their daily lives.  If everybody in the world could own a copy of this CD, I guarantee that no one would ever be angry or up-tight ever again.  The mood of the CD is so mellow and soothing.  If you've never dreamed of sitting on a tropical beach just watching a spectacular sunset, then this CD will definitly bring you to that elevated state of relaxation.  It's as close to Hawaii as you can possibly get without spending an arm and a leg.  I would recommend this album to anyone who needs to mellow out or just visualize paradise!
B00006F83Y|5.0|I'm not even going to attempt to classify this cd or put a genre on it because I'd probably sound overbearing and pretentious. Just know that it rocks. It rocks hard. With the technical blare of Homme's guitar paving the way for pretty much every song, and at a length of just under and hour, you'd think this cd would be pretty boring. But Homme is a musical genius. He alternates his vocal tracks with tracks sung by Oliveri and Mark Langean of the Screaming Trees, so even though the riffs can be deemed somewhat similar sounding throughout the album you always feel like you are hearing something new. No one Knows is probably the lightest most commercial song on the album so you may want to preview before you buy. But I garauntee you'll be satisifed if not in love with this cd. One of the best releases of recent history. **Dave Grohl is not really in the band. He plays drums throughout much of the recording but is actually a full-time member of the Foo Fighters. He was not featured on either of the bands two previous albums. Their current drummer is Joey Castillo, who was in a band whose name escapes me at the moment**
0060930187|4.0|Many readers seem to reject this novel because it offers no clear explanation for the psychololgical collapse it narrates.  But nor, from the perspective of the afflicted, is there often any such explanation in real life.  I find the way Plath unexpectedly cuts from the hilarious antics of Esther's month in New York City - told in a voice as endearing as Holden Caulfield's - into her sudden depression to be a very effective literary device.  Plath doesn't explain what happens so much as she shows us what it feels like.  Compare the tone of the first fifty pages to the last and you'll see this is a narrative which gradually unhinges, disintegrates, becomes less and less reliable.  This is precisely what you'd expect in a first-person account of a depressive episode.  Yes, it can get \\"boring and repetitive\\" as many reviewers have noted - and that's an apt representation of the lugubriousness of depression and the traditional treatments for it.  There is no simple answer, no easy happy ending for Esther.  She is a young person confronting the meaninglessness of life, too intelligent to fall into the easy distractions of marriage and work, but not sufficiently self-knowing to forge her own path without them.  That such a path is unclear is part of the point.  Hatred for this book seems to come out of a view of life (and literature) as something certain, meaningful, entertaining and closed - precisely the view which Esther, and most depressed people, cannot take.  That Plath can put us in her position for a few hundred pages, and show us how puzzling and frightening it can be, is a testament to the strength of her talent.
B0000DD7LB|1.0|Well i liked toxic and in the zone but all the rest are rubbish!!!!! I was really disapointed as i have all britneys other albums but i will NOT be buying this album!Trust me it is nothing like her other work and it is not impressive!!!!! You would be better off (A LOT BETTER) buying Christina Aguileras album Stripped as she has 20 songs all written by her!!!! She also has an AMAZING voice unlike Britneys which is TOO LOW and alieny and croaky!! Hope this helps!!!! Karen
B00005JLK1|5.0|GHOST SHIP came out about the same time as the somewhat similarly themed BELOW.  BELOW got all the critical raves, but GHOST SHIP is by far a more entertaining, frightening and coherent film.<br />Director Steve Beck gives us one of the most fantastically staged opening scenes in recent horror cinema.  With flawless editing and mind-boggling special effects, this scene is worth the cost.  I don't know why this movie has received such negative feedback.  It has atmosphere, a likeable cast, and some great effects, editing and music.  Gabriel Byrne is a little wooden as the captain, but this helps balance out the ensemble acting; Julianna Margulies joins the list of Sigourney doppelgangers, and does it well; Ron Eldard as Dodge is great in his role as the salvage man secretly in love with Margulies; Isaiah Washington (who was so brilliant in TRUE CRIME) is very good as the soon to be wedded Greer; Karl Urban shines in his role as the \\"comic relief\\"; Desmond Harrington as the boyishly charming Jack Ferriman fits his role well; and Emily Browning as the little girl is wonderful (she was also good in last year's DARKNESS FALLING).  Another memorable scene, which conjures up images of Brian dePalma's early works, is magnificent as Sarah shows us what happened on the boat.<br />I loved this movie and consider it one of the best in the genre in some time!<br />If you haven't seen it, give it a chance.  I don't think you'll be disappointed.<br />Oh and I forgot to mention the actress who plays Francesca, the night club singer.  Oozing sexuality and malevolence at the same time, she's a beautiful addition to the spectral guests.
B00009V8Z9|5.0|I love this CD... I'm hooked, it doesnt come out of my cd player for anything.  IF you like soul, folk, country, pop, whatever your going to like gavin.  He adds his own flavor to every song and is a musical mastermind.  His lyrics are catchy and because he writes all his own songs its about stuff you can relate to and are fun to sing along with. I highly recommend buying this CD, you wont be sorry if you do!Enjoy!
0345404475|5.0|This 1967 novel inspired the classic movie _Blade Runner_, and it remains Dick's most popular book because of that association. But because the movie altered so much of the original, the book has a vibrant life away from it...and it's an incredible achievement. <br />Bounty hunter Rick Deckard (married in the book version) goes on the search for the Nexus-6 androids loose on a nearly abandoned Earth where wildlife has come close to extinction. Dick explains the background much more thoroughly than the movie, and places special emphasis on the absence of genuine animals on Earth; Deckard's desire to possess a real animal instead of a robot copy becomes the focal point of his struggle to define his own humanity. John Isidore, a mentally deficient \\"chickenhead\\" who falls in with the androids (never called 'replicants' as in the film), is the other symbolic half of this confrontation with what it means to be human; the movie would change him into William Sanderson's diseased inventor. Throughout, Dick uses his piquant humor and dead-on satire to enthrall the reader. <br />A classic SF novel, no arguing about it, and it lead to a classic, if extremely different, SF film. A fascinating read. Even if you claim to dislike science fiction, you need to pick this one up. It may change your opinion of the whole genre. (And make you want to read more Philip K. Dick --there's a lot more great stuff out there!)
B0000VCZKM|3.0|The movie is great (loved it since I was a very little girl when it first came out) and the special features are well chosen (except the stupid video by \\"Play\\" of \\"Hard Knock Life\\" -- what a waste).<br />What I was really disappointed with is NO WIDESCREEN.  I've seen others complain, and I'm adding mine to get another voice in on the desire for a widescreen version.  This movie is so much better when viewed in its original form.<br />Other than that, it's great.
0345347951|5.0|It sounds like a story you've heard before: great alien masters descend on Earth and take control of the world, ushering in a golden age that may be cleverly disguised creative slavery. But Clarke's legendary novel (equal to _Rendezvous with Rama_ and _2001: A Space Odyssey_ in fame) isn't about a human rebellion against alien overlords, but the evolution of humanity into its next stage, and the ultimate dwarfing power of the unknowable order of the cosmos. The narrative glides between different characters and different eons, occasionally with a seeming clumsiness that turns out to be purposeful plotting devices. The pay-off is sublime science-fiction poetry that shows the genre's power to transcend human drama and fly into the infinite. The sheer scope of its conclusions leaves the reader wiser and sadder, the sign of a superb novel.
1400034205|5.0|While some rate the quality of the religious or philisophical references of this book, that really isn't the soul of the story.  This is a story of a young combat veteran for whom the superficial luxuries of the world no longer have value.  He must decide if his life was worth saving and why.  What he discovers isn't the \\"Meaning of Life\\" or any religious ecstasy -- in fact, he arrives closer to the beginning than he thinks.  But he goes with an appreciation for life and lives.<br />I tried to be a Somerset Maugham fan but for me, this is far and away his best work. The characters are reallistically shallow, or lost, or gritty -- as the case may be.  I reread this every couple of years just to remind myself of what a good story really sounds like.<br />-Mike
0812550757|5.0|This sequel to &quot;Ender's Game&quot; is an entirely different kind of novel, although it follows directly from the conclusion of the first book. Ender Wiggin is now thirty-five, while three thousand years have passed in the universe during his light-speed sojourns. (Card very poignantly explorers the emotional consequences of space travel that keeps the journeyer young while everyone he knows ages decades. See Haledman's &quot;The Forever War&quot; for a similar exploration of this idea.) The action occurs on the Portuguese colony planet Lusitania, where the humans struggle to understand the native race, the 'piggies,' without interfering with them. Ender arrives to investigate the deaths of two xenologists at the piggies' hands. <br />The real concern of the book is a human confrontation with a completely alien society and ecosystem, which leads to a reevaluation of the assumptions of how we treat that which is different from us. In this way, the book has much in common with Le Guin's &quot;The Left Hand of Darkness,&quot; but has less of the book's subtlety. Nonetheless, Card makes the story effective through his focus on the family conflicts tied up in the Lusitania crisis, and his message against biological imperialism and genocide in the name of safety is a potent one today. A deserving, award-winning novel. If you read &quot;Ender's Game,&quot; prepare to be surprised all over again.
B00009TB5G|1.0|I love the Lord of the Rings extended edition DVDs so much; but I often wonder if the wonder of the extended editions are half in the cases that hold them:  Amazing leather textures, beautiful artwork, and symbols from Tolkien.  But this new one.  Is cheep milk carton paper.  I baby my DVD especially my Lord of the Rings extended edition DVDs; but I've opened my DVD probably no more than five times and it's already falling apart.  It's a shame, shame, shameful thing.  It stinks; and I hope they repair their error and go back to the original manufacturer of the Fellowship of the Ring DVD.  This new one look good behind shrink-wrap, but once you open it, it feels cheep and falls apart.  Shame on you Jackson for allowing such a beautiful movie to be placed in such a stupid case.
031286504X|5.0|First off: I read this in one sitting. I couldn't stop. I started to fear that vampires were surrounding MY apartment.<br />Filmed twice and cited by many horror authors as a quintessential classic, _I Am Legend_ deserves every bit of this acclaim. This apocalyptic science-fiction take on the vampire engrosses from the first page until the `anti-horror' conclusion that overturns the customary expectations of the horror novel. (It is similar to Jack Williamson's _Darker Than You Think_, which I also recommend.)<br />Nudging in over 50,000 words in length, this novel is a perfect example of economy of storytelling. In another author's hands, this might have bloated into a five hundred page epic about the world under a vampire reign, but it would have utterly lacked the focus and passion that Matheson gives it. Matheson wrings heartbreak from simple human sequences, such as Neville's pursuit and attempt to rescue a mangy dog. Matheson has the unnerving power to find the emotional core of every scene through protagonist Robert Neville's struggle; you feel his loneliness, his shifts of despair and hope.<br />Can't emphasize it enough: this is a liteary masterpiece.
B0000DJE9R|1.0|First, before I rip this album a new one I must say that I am a huge Michael Jackson fan/supporter and IF YOU WANT HIS GREATEST HITS YOU HAVE TO BUY ALL HIS ALBUMS :).  Number Ones is a pathetic greatest hits collection.  Most of the songs on here are cut short.  Example: You Are Not Alone starts out with MJ singing on the first note which he does not do on the album version and it fades out way early.  One More Chance (the only new song) is the worst song R. Kelly has written for Michael.  It's not a bad song, but R. Kelly should have kept it to himself.  Michael should have submitted one of his own songs.  R. Kelly can write better songs, just look at Cry or You Are Not Alone.  One More Chance has a one line chorus and it sounds like it belongs on an R. Kelly record.  Another problem with this record is the name Number Ones.  Most of these songs didn't make it to number one, in fact many didn't even crack the top 10.  If you own all of the albums and you want the song one more chance, just buy the single.  I own both, but most people shouldn't bother unless they care about a complete collection.  This collection is a weak display of MJ's amazing talent.  It basically contains radio versions of his songs so they can put more on the cd.  I love michael and know that he is innocent.  I can't wait for his new album.  I think MJ released this just to fullfil his record contract.  Now he can be free and actually get promoted :).
0880389052|4.0|Last year, Salvatore's \\"Icewind Dale Trilogy\\" caught me by surprise, turning out to be a thoroughly enjoyable fantasy romp. As basic entertainment, it delivered. Then I turned to his second trilogy, this one a prequel about the early life of the rebellious drow (dark elf), Drizzt Do'Urden. Drizzt has a huge following among contemporary fantasy readers. He's certainly no Elric, Conan, or Aragorn, but he's an enjoyable action character with the right amount of tragedy to keep him interesting. <br />The first book of his youthful adventures relates how he rebels against the rigid, cruel world of the drow and their undergound homeland. Salvatore pours on the action set pieces and monsters, although the politics between the drow houses do overburden the story in the final third. The best part of the book is the author's portrait of the sinister subterranean world of the Underdark. It's a unique setting for an entire fantasy novel, and Salvatore invests it with equal parts wonder and dread. Get ready for the next two in the trilogy, _Exile_ and _Sojourn_. They're just as good.
B000060P79|1.0|This plan must not be that easy to solve. First off the singer, very high voice... dont understand how you can even enjoy listening to this crap. Better music is all over at the metal scene. now where is the 0 star rating when u need it?
0345452577|2.0|I'm a big fan of Jonathan Kellerman and have read all of his books.  The plot of this one is a bit too familiar.  Psychologist help police solve brutal killings.  And there's even a Robin-esque woman by this side, but not too involved in the murderish goings on.<br />I hope he brings back Milo and Alex -- why try to remake the original characters, when they are already done so well.
B00005O438|4.0|The movie pretty good, I'm a bit disapointed they didn't follow the book ending, but that's a minor complaint.  It is also a bit dated, but still a worthwhile film.  What ticks me off is the studios releasing DVD's that look like 10 year old VHS copies.  DVD Should be crystal clear!  The picture here is as fuzzy as the dog!
0385504209|4.0|This is a very entertaining book, especially to someone like myself who enjoys both conspiracy theories and theological theories.  I was pleasantly surprised that it is light reading and very easy to follow - as some reviews have said it is set up like a book that will soon be made into a big Hollywood production.  Personally, I think it's great because sometimes we just need a book with some intriguing thrills to take our mind off life and not challenge our brain (we have textbooks and Scientific American for that sort of thing!)<br />I don't think anyone should take it seriously as far as theological history goes though.  It is fiction and there is a mish-mash of different historical ideas that touch upon real theories I've read about, but are manipulated to benefit the fictional story and I would imagine were in no way meant to be considered truths.  I also think that it was a little tasteless to use the name of a real Catholic organization in the plot, if I had been the author or editor I personally would have changed the name to a fictional one.  Unless of course they were hoping for some controversy to help marketing - which wouldn't surprise me.
B000002UB3|5.0|It's almost silly to write a review of this album because words can't describe it adequately. It's not just the best Beatle's album of all time, it's the best Rock n Roll album of all time. For one moment in history the world's best band was able  to collaborate like never before. Each member was at their peak and Martin was there to produce a gem.<br />I can't understand why this album is down to 4.5 stars. It almost saddens me. If you're new to the Beatles then this is the album that will make you a rabid Beatles fan.
0385504209|5.0|I absolutely loved this book; great concept with and extremely interesting viewpoint on the early church.  I find it rather amusing how most of the poor reviews this book has received come from what appear to be Christian fanatics.  The book, however, is not without its flaws.  The characters are nothing more than cardboard cutouts.  While I would have appreciated realistic, breathing, characters to read about, it in no way detracted from my enjoyment of the book.
B000009HF2|5.0|This is one of the coolest and one of the absolute greatest LIVE albums EVER! Frampton knows how to please and this cd is proof even though you arent physically even there! All the songs are great but the highlight of the album would be \\"Do You Feel Like We Do\\" which is, in my opinion, one of the best LIVE songs ever done period. It is just so cool when he is wailing away on the guitar and then starts going at it with the voice box, the whole crowd gets very enthused. Anyways if you're looking for a good LIVE album than this is it!
B00004RFFS|5.0|This film is great and weird film. All the girls think Brad Pitt and Tom cruise are so hot and watch them as vampires is great. Their performances are great,the story kicks ass, and a shat load of gore. This movie shows that vampires are hard to kill. I still think the best vampire film is dracula dead and loving it. Yeah its a Mel Brooks movie but its hilarious. The best horror is this. But then again I like Bram Stokers Dracula. Thats the best but Mel Brooks is hilarious. You need to watch this and buy this dvd.
B0000AQVCL|5.0|I cant believe it! REaL rock n' roll is back again folks! I almost forgot what it was after being exposed to the likes of Limp Bizkit and Linkin Park for so long, thank God Jet and the \\"the\\" bands are here to save the day for us people who like the REAL stuff. This is very raw and gritty throw back to the 70's, it harkens back to the likes of AC/DC and the Who. The first sing \\"Are You Gonna Be My Girl\\" is one of the best singles I've heard all year, a GREAT GREAT song that is practically over flowing with sexy 70's swing. Dont worry all the songs arent the same uniform sound, they split it up, there are sad ballads, fuzzy rockers and foot stompin beats. Anyways if your fed up with the dumb trend rock has gotten into these days(linkin park, limp bizkit, hoobastank(what a dumb name)then this cd is definitley for you!
0553213105|5.0|How a spinster who was living in relative isolation in the English countryside during the earliest years of the 19th century was able to write the ultimate romance novel is a question that nobody now alive can answer.<br />Yet in PRIDE AND PREJUDICE, this is exactly what author Jane Austen has accomplished.<br />Written at a moment in time when it clearly was too early to have been inspired by the writings of other authors, P-and-P has every component that the greatest love stories require. The lovers meet, there is tension, there is conflict, there is separation and, finally, with the reader's pulse quickened, there is the acknowledgment of their feelings for one another.<br />Lizzie Bennett and her hero, the conveniently rich Fitzwilliam Darcy, are two of the most significant lovers to be found in literature. And, in creating them, Jane Austen laid the groundwork for the elements that would need to be present in the modern romance novel.<br />All of Miss Austen's books are worth reading, but PRIDE AND PREJUDICE is unique among them in being great.
6305907145|4.0|Reputed to be Jane Austen's personal favorite from among all her sometimes straightlaced novels, \\"Mansfield Park\\" touches on the darker elements of society, but does not focus primarily on the faults of the men.  Mariah shows the greed and lust she inherited from her father, while her oldest brother, Tom, seems to fit the mold of some of Austen's heroines, rebelling at the injustices and ugliness he has witnessed.  The Crawfords, a brother and sister team of questionable morals, team up on our hero and heroine, Edmond and Franny.  The DVD touches on the evils of slavery, drugs, lust, and the \\"selling\\" off of young women into society.  I felt it should have carried a stronger story line into the slave trade and the goings-on in Antiqua, which obviously led to the moral break between Sir Thomas and his son Tom.  But, all in all, I enjoyed it.  Particularly, Franny's epistles to her younger sister, putting her unique spin on European history.
1573225517|4.0|This book is one I am highly recommending.  Nick HOrnby takes his real-life background of working with music & writing & combines them flawlessly.  The story revolves around Rob, a Generation X member who is reflecting on how his past loves (musical loves & human loves) impacted him.  Rob tells of stories of young, naive love, followed by young adult love, & leads into his current love.  He has some help in telling his story along the way with two sidekicks from a music store he owns.  The two co-workers bring humor & help in trying to put things into a simple list of top 5...ANYTHING.  Rob divulges more about how his heart is hurting throughout.  This book is written VERY well & anyone who is a child of the 80s will have a stab of nostalgia as an added bonus.  A must have!
B00005M91K|5.0|The best part about this movie is that each time you view it, a cinematographer's delight, devoid of plot, dialog, or heroes, but resplendent with breathtaking images, themes, and moving music, you can find some thing different to think about as you experience a total sense of immersion.  This is a deeply spiritual film, but without making a single presumption of where the viewer's spiritual center may be.  With twelve people in a room watching it together, each person will come away with something different.  This movie is the ultimate daydream!
B00004Z459|5.0|OK, OK, OK, I admit. other than Somewhere I Belong, Metoeora is a bit tough on the first listen.  but if you are not hooked by the third spin then go BUY SOME BALLS BECAUSE YOU SUCK!!!!  in fact, you MUST also buy Hybrid Theory and Live from Texas (which is a live rehash of the other two).  on Hybrid Theory and Meteora there are at least ten awesome tracks.  they will be THE band from this decade.....period.
B00005JLWN|5.0|WOW! This is a movie I bought the day after I rented it. The video store clerk suggested it after I passed it by at least a dozen times (I'm not interested in taking \\"chances\\" on rentals). I'm sure glad he did. Original and action packed. The last big seen of the movie was worth the purchase alone. <BR>It's strange that a movie like Equilibrium can be such a sleeper when movies like A League of Extraodinary Gentlemen (yeah, whatever) are such box office smash hopefuls.<BR>Buy this movie, or at least rent or borrow it, especially if you enjoy martial arts, action, original movie ideas, sci-fi or all of the above.
B00005YUPO|4.0|This video is nice enough, but both Baby and I prefer the Baby Mozart video.  This one has more of the incongruous, un-Bach-related bits than we would like, and unlike other reviewers' children, my 2-month-old cries when he sees the kids on the video. Perhaps he's a little young for it, but since I'm a huge Bach fan, I wanted to share something with Baby.  I think we'll stick to my Bach CDs and the Baby Mozart DVD for now, and try this again when he's a little older.
B0000TB01Y|5.0|This is one of the best Broadway soundtracks I have listened to in years!  The list of \\"best songs\\" covers nearly the whole CD, but my favorites include \\"What Is This Feeling\\", \\"Defying Gravity\\", and \\"For Good\\".
B0000A1RJI|5.0|This soundtrack is a must have, especially for a true and loyal fan of Pirates of the Caribbean. The scores are amazing. They make you feel as though you are in the movie.
B000089RVX|4.0|Don't listen to those people who hate this group. I have severe clinical depression, and although I'm on meds now, the songs resembled me so much it's scary! <br />This album is dark, but is not graphic. Even the lyrics about cutting are vague. The songs \\"Hello\\" and \\"Imaginary\\" resembled me to a T! However, all the songs are beautiful, which is rare for a CD.<br />The only reason I am not giving this CD 5 stars, is because it could act as a trigger for self-mutilation. If you have or are recovering from depression and/or suicidal thoughts, DON'T get this CD. Please wait until you are better mentally! <br />Other than that, this CD is excellent!!!
B0000AGWJ7|4.0|first off...AWESOME album. I heard the chorus to Desecrate at work... an dloved it so i bought th ealbum and it didnt really let me down. However i see some serious similarities here with Iron Maiden's octaves and Metallica's old school style. Im not a huge fan of the whole metalcore/screamo scene but i thought itd be interesting to hear it since im a metallica/iron maiden fan i wondered what it would sound like. Awesome album and i look for an even better follow up<br />Rock On
B00009V7T2|5.0|This is music worth spending a few bucks on. <br />We as rock fans are stuck in a depression; Britney Spears and the boy bands have shifted to meet the needs of today's music audience and Kurt Cobain has been completely forgotten. Many of us download music using file sharing programs, but I want to tell everyone here something. In order to defeat the pop revolution we need to stop downloading music and support rock bands that have snuck under the radar. Mars Volta is the most creative band on the planet; they are a blend of Radiohead's later music, extreme rock, and an ingredient of their own concoction. I urge you with all my heart to check this band out. They have the ability to get us out of this rock n' roll dry spell, but they need your help. Support real rock; buy this album. If you are going to download something, download Blink 182 or N'Sync. Once again, I urge you to give this a try and support rock music. To get rock back into the forefront, we need to support the bands. And Mars Volta is the best out there.

0684867621|5.0|Normally the nine-year-old Trisha McFarland really enjoys the Saturday outings her recently divorced mother organizes. Even this time the six-mile hike on the Main-New Hampshire branch of the Appalachian Trail promises to become an enjoyable first experience for Trisha. But when her brother Pete starts to squabble with his mother, Trisha starts to trail behind in the hope that the quarrel will soon come to an end. Then she makes a terribly bad decision: she leaves the path. The last words she can hear Pete say are \\"-don't know why we have to pay for what you guys did wrong!\\" It doesn't take long for Trisha to realize that she is lost. Lost in the woods.<br />The Girl Who Loved Tom Gordon is a novel that stands out between the numerous other works of Stephen King for two reasons. First it is a small book; it only counts about 200 pages, which in itself is quite remarkable if you compare it to the sizes of King's later novels. Secondly, and most remarkable, is the straightforward story-line and small cast.<br /><br />One girl gets lost in the woods and that's all it is. Not true!<br />Although the story is very simple, it goes directly for the throat of the reader. The powerful characterization of that little girl creates a deeply rooted involvement. It is as though the reader can feel the pain Trisha has to go through. At one point you even want to shout: \\"Don't go there! Don't do it!\\", just because you've been completely swallowed up by this emotional roller coaster. Although spared from real action scenes, this little fairy tail reads like a page turner.<br />Put it like this: The Girl Who Loved Tom Gordon is an `evil' book, just because you will get hit while reading it.
B0000AXE8I|5.0|Story was kind of lame, but the SPECIAL EFFECTS are well worth it. I wish I could have seen this in the theaters, but the bad/mixed reviewes kept me away. I still really think this movie is a great movie, but only for the eye candy.
1857993284|4.0|I enjoyed the story of a young persons introduction to philosophy. As a novel, it lacks something. A perfect book for my 14 year old neice who is excited about learning and is preparing for college in a few years.
B00009V7PJ|5.0|Although I liked her show from 1999 a little bit more, which was very similar - this Farewell is really awesome and great. But I have one complaint: why didn't she do Europe to say here GoodBye?<br />Thank the Stars above: Madonna is very often in Europe. That s a big comfort.<BR>And Cher s right: its not Britney Spears etc. - its Kylie Minogue setting up as great Shows as Cher. Watch it!
B000002H6C|5.0|its clearly a fantastic CD. i always hear that the production makes it worse, but it think it rules. kinda like \\"soft, quiet metal\\"...but thats just me.
B000002KE2|5.0|Vol. 4 is the heavist album Black Sabbath ever made. Its far from the best Black Sabbath album but its a classic none the less. Tony Iommi's guitar is massive on tracks like 'Supernaught' and 'Tomorrows Dream'. Ozzy Osbournes vocals are pure and solid as always, through and through. Gezzer, and Bills rythm section remains the greatest in rock history! Tight as ever and never out of time.<br />Vol. 4 offers classic Black Sabbath tracks like 'Tomorrows Dream' 'Changes' 'Snowblind' and the instrumental 'Laguna Sunrise.' 'Changes is a strange errie ballad, yes a ballad and its actually pretty good, but far from great! 'Laguna Sunrise' is just Tony with a six string acoustic.<br />This was a pivetal point for Black Sabbath, on Vol. 4 the began to get really experimental and creative. On Masters Of Reality The boys got somewhat experimental but even the emortal Masters Of Reality falls short of Vol. 4. This is classic and recomended!
B000005Z0E|5.0|2Pac released his debut in the early 90's, released some more albums, all sold well. With that, he was crowned king of the west side. Also, with him having a major enemy (Biggie Smalls) that made him even more popular. It was more aggressive than an MC battle. And how did they become enemys? Well, the one that started it, was Biggie by copied some of 2Pac's planned stuff. A big battle. They were both the crowned kings of there sides, because they were like the two best rappers. And a way to be sure of that, is how many albums they both sold, and how many hits they had. But unlike most of 2Pac's albums, this one doesn't have to many hits, but it does have some. Such as, \\"Trapped\\" or such as, \\"Brendas Got A Baby\\" And another reason sure that theye are the best rappers, is only with both of there debuts, they were the crowned the kings of there side. <br />And before all the copying stuff happing , they were awesome friends. They did concerts, and everything. And I think when this album came out, they were enemys. Like in \\"Hit Em Up\\" it is easy to tell that they are enemys, but hit em up isn't on this album, but on his greatest hits. After this master peice rap classic cmae out, 2Pac decided to release some more albums. All went platinum, except to me, this would be his 2nd best album, next to All Eyez On Me which was a best selling rap CD.<br />So people, if you don't have this, and you want to have a major rap collection, you better get this CD, quick.<br />R.I.P.

0783225725|4.0|The Twighlight Zone meets the Good, the Bad, and the Ugly. I like this movie on many different levels. First, there is no one better at playing mean than Clint Eastwood. The level of mean here almost equals his output in Dirty Harry. Second, there's a midget in this movie, and it isn't some ten second cameo either. This midget, who knows how to act, plays a major role throughout the movie. As far as midget performances go, this guy ranks right up there with the Wizard of Oz and anything Joe Pesci has done. Finally, the supernatural feel of the movie is accentuated by an unnerving soundtrack and irregular camera angles. <br />If you're hungry for DVD extras, this release will leave your stomach growling. There's a trailer, notes, and bios to snack on, but no commentary tracks or interviews to gorge on.
0385504209|5.0|I had no idea what I was getting into when I started reading this book.  It is a rivettting book that will teach you secrets and stories that may make you question how you actually view your own beliefs on religion and art.  Beyond that its a great thriller that keeps you interested and questioning who was really behind the murder and all this intrigue.  I have read Angels and Demons since reading the Da Vinci Code and I have to say DVC is better, Angels and Demons was good but I could see that the Robert Langdon story is somewhat formulaic.  But I liked the formula better in DVC and the little tidbits of info was cooler.<br />I should warn that some people may be offended by some of the theories that are brought up by the characters, specifically questions about the Christian religion.  My only statement to the theories is that there is nothing wrong with hearing another viewpoint its what you decide to do with it.  I don't believe this book is anti-religion or even Christian, it is just bringing up questions that if people want to look further into them go ahead, and if you don't then just read it for story because it is well written and exciting.  Plus there is a lot of cool decoding stuff.
