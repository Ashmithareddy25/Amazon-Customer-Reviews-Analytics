B008NABUU8|5.0|Getting very challenging towards the last couple stages. Very excited to be challenged for a change of pace. Can be annoying when the controls don't react properly, but when a game is free, you can forgive that.
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|this a good game to waste away time (if you're just starting - have patience and don't sell your prizes)
B007TK77QE|5.0|People - if you want a Harry Potter book - read a Harry Potter book!!! Don't expect Hogwarts in this one. This book reminded me of a Maeve Binchy with the way the characters are developed and intertwine, crossed with an episode of Midsommer Murders. It portrays a gritty true to life town with a mixture of shock and humour. I loved it!
B0064W667Y|3.0|Its not a great story, but it has piqued my interest. im hoping the next installment  meets or surpasses expectations.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this game is like the best game in the world:  I REALLY LOVE THIS AWSOME GAME!&iexcl;!!!!!!!!!!!!!&iexcl;  WOW GOOD GREAT COOL
B00870ZH3U|4.0|But I'm happy to see the story continued.<br />I've seen people here scoffing at the idea that Christine could ever have been happy to engage in...carnal relations with the Phantom, and that she was effectively date raped.<br />One of Erik's lines in Beneath a Moonless Sky is \\"You found the place where I hid\\". I think the idea is that she came back and found him, sometime between the events in PTO and her marriage to Raoul. I also think the writers were a bit too subtle on that point.<br />It's not the original.  But in some ways, the characters are deeper. Raoul undergoes more character development in Act 1 than he does in the entirety of PTO. Christine has a spine, relatively, anyway.  I think it's nice to see more of  Mme. and Mlle. Giry, though I wish they weren't deranged. However, Mme. Giry's anger at being cast off is kinda understandable. But I guess every story needs a villan and neither Raoul nor the Phantom can fill that role.<br />Some of the sets were spectacular.  I understand this production has been reworked since the London opening. I, like many others, am firmly on the Karimloo/Boggess train, and would love to hear them sing it, but I thought the actors in this production were solid, though Christine was a bit shrill from time to time.<br />I think it's worth a look for any devotee of the story.
B007UW9VWO|5.0|Jiro and his sons are the last of a dying breed. Each of them works to better their skill and master their craft each and every day.  There are no days off for any of them. The cinematography in this film is outstanding and I only wish that it was longer (not a complaint but rather it is a matter of greed[I didn't want it to end]). It felt like we were sitting there with Jiro and his sons during the interviews instead of watching from our couch. I watched this online using my prime membership, but I am also going to buy a physical copy to keep.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|I enjoy reading romance novels, and I have fallen in love with this series.  I have been waiting for Reflected in You to come out ever since I finished reading the last page of Bared to You.  It may not be for everyone, but Eva and Gideon's intense relationship keeps you turning the page to find out how their love story will play out.
B008HK3XOU|5.0|This case is for the HD model kindle fire.  Very durable and easy to use.  We really like the elastic band feature that secures the closing of the case when not in use.  One more thing, the case is easy to put in a standing position.
B003H4I4JU|5.0|Very exciting, the story was of Ender continued so the reader was kept interested. I will also read the next book in the series.
B004LWZWGK|1.0|This has got to be the worst Batman Movie ever made. It did not follow any kind of comic book storyline. Batman was a complete idiot in this movie. At no time was Batman ever like he was potrayed in this movie. The Bane origin was wrong the Robin Origin was a joke. Talia's origin was wrong, it is just sad to see the money wasted on this grand flop. What is even sadder is that some people lost thier lives trying to watch it. WB should have let Tim Burton finish his trilogy a long time ago and give us his Superman Lives also. Why does WB keep making the same movies over and over? Next we will get Batmans Origins as made up by someone else. Batman Begins was good, though I dont like Bale as Batman. The Dark Knight was Great. This Movie was a complete let down I wont buy it or ever watch it again. Horrible and sad to watch Marvel just stomp WBs face into the dirt making great movie after great movie. Where is our Flash? Justice League? Wonder Woman? Why can Marvel make so many super hero movies and WB just remake the same 2 movies over and over? I will give them credit, we finally got a Green Lantern movie. Stack up your DC live action movies against your Marvel ones who has much better movies? MARVEL!!! Why oh why do us DC fans keep getting ripped off? I rather watch Batman and Robin with George Clooney again than this joke.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|Great fun game...the fun of the carnival right on my kindle!  Oh and without the $6.00 corndog or $5.00 soda. It could use more prizes...
B003YL4LYI|1.0|This book was ridiculously long for a book in which NOTHING HAPPENED!  The entire book was endless detail that nobody is interested in(including the characters), the introduction of new characters while doing absolutely nothing with the ones we're already familiar with and as usual, the death of those you probably like.<br /><br />We know the real world sucks, that's why we read fantasy, George. So the good guy can win for a change. Total suckfest.
1781164150|5.0|Dying Breath: 4.5 out of 5<br />Okay everyone, I need you to close your eyes, take a deep breath and prepare for what you are about to read. Yes that is right, it is not a horror comic book review, but a review of a book based on a horror themed movie. AHHHH!!!!!!!!!!!! Hey I can read books, as long as they have pictures, and let me tell you, this book has some GORE-Geous visuals. basically what we have here is a breakdown on the art from the movie Hotel Transylvania. Each character in the movie has their own little section that includes some great commentary by Tracey Miller-Zarneke and Genndy Tartakovsky, as well as the designs, story boards and renderings of the cast. I have to say that my favorite part is seeing the whole process and how they went from concept to final design. On a design basis alone, this book is laid out beautifully. I think any fan of the movie would want to have this on their shelf, and I don't mean just the die-hard fans, I mean every fan. I also think that anyone wanting to get a great behind the scenes look at how much time and work go into an animated film would want to read this one. Some great in-depth coverage of how it all went down. Sadly this reviewer has yet to see this movie. You better believe that my interest was piqued when I saw the trailers, but now I am just dying to go see it. This is a fantastic resource that will make everyone say AHHHH!!!!!!
0446580848|1.0|What can I say? I just could not finish the book. And yet I am a long time fan, have read every single one of his previous books, reread some of them. Alas, in the Panther the magic is gone. Corey's wisecracking falls flat, there are pages and pages of irrelevant stuff, insider info about the best places to eat in New York, and some decent historical details about what's going on in Yemen. De Mille weaves the plot around some real events and even real people (though he takes great care to change names and relevant factors), but the book never gets off the ground.
B005DJGMQE|5.0|The movie was excellent in format and presentation.  My heart ached and was frustrated by the gov'ts actions as if they are true.  The one thing that kept reverberating through my head was that in those days women did not have much power at all.  Even if she went to authorities they wouldn't have believed her as they didn't believe the male clerk working for the gov't.  History repeated itself with JFK and them not believing reports give to them.  I would hightly recommend this movie to be viewed.  The history books do not tell us much about the trial.
B005ETA5K2|4.0|Installed drivers, plugged in, noticed it made a high pitch noise but everything worked, connected to wifi, [few minutes later] Windows said USB failed, unplugged-plugged back in, read fine but no wifi networks would show up, then Windows said USB failed again, unplugged-plugged back in again, dead, nothing shows up, no lights, tried different computers and reinstalling drivers and nothing. Sad, I was really excited about this card. Will buy another one when the return process finishes :(<br /><br />EDIT:<br />Got a new adapter and it works. Been using it for a month now and no issues. Running on Windows 8 64bit. I know it's not fully supported with Windows 8 but I finally got it to work. The only thing that doesn't work is the virtual wireless to turn it into a hotspot but that's Ok with me because I just use my internal wireless card for that.
0812416503|5.0|Another book I'm sorry I put off so long. Any lovers of Jane Eyre should add this to their \\"to read\\" list, as they are similar in style and storyline. An unnamed female protagonist becomes swept up in a whirlwind romance with Maxim De Winter, a man desperate to forget the tragedy that befell him some months before the book started. They meet in Monte Carlo and are quickly married, though our unnamed woman must continue to work to come out from  under Rebecca's shadow. The setting and the tone are perfectly balanced between overwhelming and lovely, with just enough of a hint of creepy. The ending packs a pretty good twist that satisfies.<br /><br />There isn't much in the way of red flags. There is a little violence, though the description of Rebecca's demise is not explained graphically. No cussing and no sexual situations fit with the time period.
B000OZ0NXA|5.0|Lee Chuld is the best there is. His story is full of action, suspense and excitment. And he does it all without without vulgarity.
0439023521|5.0|I feel like not very many books I read live up to the hype surrounding them, but this one proved that's not always the case. Katniss is an interesting, spunky teenager who can fend for herself but has doubts like most teens. She faces the situation into which she is thrust with a commendable maturity. The supporting characters are well-developed, despite the first person point of view. Given the subject, there are obviously rather violent bits, but all things considered, Collins handles it appropriately. It's a fast-paced read that shouldn't be started if you need to sleep! Despite what Joel Stein thinks, this is great for mature teens and adults alike, with much more depth than your average YA work.
0425263916|2.0|I wasn't a huge fan of the first book in the series, \\"Bared to You\\", but I was curious as to where the author was taking this series so I had to wait for it to finally reach my library. All I can say is \\"Seriously?\\" This is one of those books where you end up hating everyone.<br /><br />The first problem is that the plot was centered around one of those numb-skulled plot devices that irritate the life out of me. Eva is in danger. Gideon and her mother know. Do they tell her? Nope. Her mother, in a complete character inconsistency, just lets it ride even though the danger is at her daughter's work. Gideon, who is apparently a total idiot, comes up with some complicated scheme to rid Eva of danger, provide himself with an alibi, and eliminate any motive that can be attributed to him. This is the best idea that a genius billionaire could come up with? To make this idiotic plot work, Eva had to lose her mind and turn into a whining, nagging, insecure thirteen year (apologies to all thirteen year old's). Apparently, Eva cannot be trusted to be a player in Gideon's scheme- and I can kind of see why, she does not handle stress at all well. It was a far better solution to play excessively cruel and unusual mind games with her. Whatever. On the one hand, I hate the \\"everyone knows the heroine is in danger except the heroine\\" trope. On the other hand, Eva was Too Stupid To Live in this book so I probably wouldn't have told her either.<br /><br />Eva. I know she is \\"damaged\\" but this book had less to do with her damage and a lot to do with a potentially weak character. If this is what Eva turns into when she has suffered a set-back, then she still needs a lot of therapy. Geez, I feel bad saying this but I just hated her guts by the end of this book. She was so whiny and vapid and insecure and obsessive and jealous and immature. I could keep going. Yes, her relationship with Gideon is not \\"healthy\\" and leaves a lot to be desired but... wasn't that the point of the first book? She was going into this thing with her eyes wide open? And, as a victim of sexual abuse, can't she cut the guy some slack? He hasn't ever dealt with his issues and he just hooked up with Eva a month ago- so why the intense and nagging need to know all about his secrets- RIGHT THIS SECOND OR SHE IS GOING TO GO INTO AN EMOTIONAL TAILSPIN! Seriously, I would assume real progress takes a lot longer than a month. I just got so tired of her endless internal thoughts about Gideon and why isn't he picking up the phone and who is in the room with him and is that nurse looking at him and did he talk to the nurse and where are you and why do you have that tone and does he love me and does he love me enough and do I love myself enough.... Argh. That is seriously how this book felt to me. Like an amped up thirteen year old after her very first break-up- paroxysms of annoying self-pity.<br /><br />Gideon? Who is this guy? The character seems to be turning into this cipher for an obsessive woman's romance novel. Yes, some people love these obsessive love stories (me, not as much but they have some charms). But, it seems he is either an alpha male card-board cut-out or he is spouting whatever Eva wants to hear like her immature thirteen year old boyfriend who is completely unhinged by his first taste of love.<br /><br />I gotta say, I pretty much ended up hating all the characters. I know, it probably isn't fair but I really hated Eva's character turn-around. And, the plot wasn't all that great. All in all, the earth will continue rotating if you skip this book.he was going into this thing with her eyes wide open? And, as a victim of sexual abuse, can't she cut the guy some slack?

0071766588|3.0|I've been teaching TOEFL for more than 15 years and this is the book I recommend to my students. It's limited in the amount of practice, however it is the most authentic material that test takers can find. An added bonus in the fourth edition is the fact that the CD ROM is both Mac and Windows compatible for the first time.<br /><br />UPDATE: I've purchased three of these books from Amazon and another three elsewhere and the CD ROM's (six in total) all quit unexpectedly after the first two speaking tasks, making it impossible to view the last three speaking questions in all of the practice tests. It's almost certainly a bug in the software. I've downgraded my rating from five stars to three.
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|Wasn't sure if I would like this or not, but now I'm addicted !!!  It's getting rough now, I enjoy the challenges it throws at me.
6302561841|5.0|First of all, the seller was very good and prompt. The item was exactly how the seller said it would be and I would definately recommmend this seller to others!(I hope they do a lot of business!). As for the movie, very good. It shows the talent that Chaplin was. He was brilliant at making people laugh and cry. Perfect 5!:product is very good(just as the seller said it would be!) and the movie is very good and very touching.<br />--peter  --jn 3:16
B008Y5OW20|2.0|This is not a creative reinvention of the \\"classics\\" like the Honeydrippers of the early eighties.<br />This is a \\"classic\\" case of selling out like Rod Stewart over the last decade. Everybody gets old some day, but you hate seeing it happen to 1 of the best creative minds in the history of Rock - n - Roll.<br />Sure, the production value is extremely high, the packaging is top notch. I just  cannot believe i've waited this long.... for this.<br />If I could put the Cellophane back on the CD,  I'd regift it to my 73 yr old mother.

B007GCY8FS|3.0|I have read every book Lee Child has written about Jack Reacher and there have been many.  Lately, I feel the caliber of writing has slipped enormously.  In my opinion, the last 2 books just do not have it. I love the character of Jack Reacher, although using Tom Cruise in the upcoming movie about Reacher was another poor choice.  (Probably not the fault of Lee Child).  However, why didn't they pick a more virile man like Bobby Cannavale who would have made a heckof a Jack Reacher.
0761171703|5.0|Dancers Among Us celebrates the beauty that surrounds us and helps redirect our attention on what an astonishing world we live in. Jordan Matter captures moments we all know and often take for granted, injects beauty in a pose or an expression and, in an instant, we rediscover the magnificence of everyday life. This book is a celebration of life and beauty.
B009CPJHY4|5.0|The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel is a poignant view of 6 individuals (2 of whom are married to each other) as they travel to India to retire in a luxury hotel, only to find that the hotel is not quite the way it was described in the brochure.  It's a story of transformation for each of them, including the young Indian man who strives to turn his dream of owning a luxury hotel into reality.

B007IXWL2C|3.0|This one felt a little dragged out. It seemed at times like the author was describing way too much, just to fill pages. I found myself skimming quite often in order to move the story along.
B0035JRVR8|4.0|Love the movie, you can see the most interesting places of Rome with a beautiful history. The back and white movies have some sharm that let you want more.
B0050DIWFC|3.0|Defending Jacob made for great discussion about parenting, nature vs. nurture, our moral obligations, etc. the writing was engaging, though a little long in some parts and not as dialogue oriented in parts that would have been apt...
B0063IH60K|5.0|Really enjoy playing this game during my travels. Great way to pass the time and also learn to be a better solitaire player. Thanks.
B008TMA1LY|4.0|It reminds me of Diner Dash. I like that you can get other characters to help out.  The only thing I don't like is that you can't get very many of the heart used to upgrade things while in game.
B007G3H8Y0|5.0|It's a wonder I haven't worn this out from playing it so much. I alternate between Save me San Fransisco, California 37 and My Private Nation. There is just something so appealing about his voice not to mention the writing, which I admit sometimes is a bit funky....but fun all the same..It's a real pick-me-up always!

0385536828|4.0|There will be those who object to the twist at the end of Ian McEwan's \\"Sweet Tooth,\\" his foray into Graham Greene/John le Carr&eacute; territory.  Some may feel that it justifies the entire book that's come before, others will feel that it negates it.  I fall somewhere in the middle.  I can tell you that I finished the novel with a smile on my face, amazed (and oddly charmed) by McEwan's ability to pull the rug out from under his readers.  \\"How clever, unexpected and satisfying,\\" I thought.  Then I felt mildly manipulated, even cheated somewhat.  Imagine eating a rich, dense piece of chocolate cake (indulging one's sweet tooth, if you will), delighting in its decadence and sinfulness -- only to find out it's actually low-fat and gluten-free.  You've still enjoyed it, but now realize how little actual substance there was to the darn thing.  That's my experience of \\"Sweet Tooth.\\"  I enjoyed it tremendously, was never bored...but expected more.  It's a clever exercise tricked out as literature.  But then \\"tricking\\" is what espionage is all about, isn't it: things aren't exactly what they seem.<br /><br />McEwan is a master of misdirection, so let's give him full credit where it's due; he has obviously written the book he wants.  Readers drawn by this sweet's tempting political and sociological wrappings, however, are likely to be disappointed by the rather bland, banal treat within.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|This book at any adult age will draw you in. The author writes in such a way to put you in the action. Must read!

B00866JL96|5.0|I really enjoyed this movie and highly recommend it to viewers.  Part of my enjoyment in it is due to the fact that I'm in it.  I'm one of the background players in the political campaign fundraiser filmed at Houmas House north of New Orleans.  Look for the rather handsome man in the pin-striped suit shaking the candidate's hand.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|This entire trilogy was a good read.  It kept me entertained and reading even when I should have been doing other things.  I didn't want to put the books down and had to buy the next one immediately with no wait time.  My suggestion would be to just buy the trilogy and not purchase the books seperately.

B000FCKGPC|3.0|[[ASIN:0606267263 A Feast for Crows]]The first volume was great. I even splurged on the Blue Ray Disks. The second and third were o.k. This last one is almost painful to read. There are soooo many characters, who can keep them straight? And the ones I care about are barely mentioned (that is the ones not hanged, gored, beheaded or thrown out of windows). I will finish the book and most likely read the fifth volume in hopes that something will be resolved, and that I won't have to construct a family tree for the Lannisters, Tyrells, Starks, Baratheons, Freyes, and so on and so on.....
B0060D2SU6|4.0|And it's a little heartwarming. Girlfriend loves it, I think it's got some good humor. Rob Schneider does a fantastic job, and you gotta love the cameo by Adam Sandler. Great stuff.
B008AK8FHM|2.0|Was really looking forward to reading this book but was quite disappointed at its content.  As some others have commented, the book is very deficient on details of the actual experience.  It is way too focused on trying to explain the experience as<br />scientific proof of an afterlife and justifying the doctor's experience as being real.  Definitely not enough material dealing with the actual experience itself or with the supposed knowledge gained during the NDE.  I did bookmark a couple of passages but those were more particular sentences that spoke to me specifically as I have been searching for comfort due to my father's passing.  I was very disappointed in this book.
B000J5XS3C|5.0|This is a great little mixer.<br /><br />It's built like a rock and does a VERY GOOD job, so for the price of this Xenyx mixer, you bet it's a whole lot of value.<br /><br />Eight inputs is just right for my setup, which includes a synth (stereo), 2 dynamic mics, an MP3 player, 2 guitars (connected to the \\"direct\\" output of my guitar combo-amp), and a pair of active monitors.<br /><br />I still have available the FX output and return.<br /><br />If I'd seen the 802 and 1002 or larger side by side, I might have chosen the larger version, which has a slider button (instead of a rotating button) for the master output.  USB would also be great to connect to a computer and do some recording.  The USB for recording may also be done if you buy an additional Behringer little box which is also very low-priced.<br /><br />This is a VERY GOOD purchase and I'd recommend it to anyone looking for a GREAT MIXER in a small enclosure (with a very low price).
B005K17RU0|4.0|I really like this app. I use it all the time. Its great that it was free. The only problem I had was one time it froze when I used the map. I had to turn off my kindle. When I turned it back on everything was fine.

B009NQKPUW|3.0|Prometheus has tanked. To be fair, I had fun watching it tank. Three stars for neat set designs and atmospheric images. Also, the trailer is fantastic. How often do you see a tailer that's better than the actual movie? Trailers deserve fair praise. This film is beautifully designed so enjoy the sleek visuals, but beware! Ridley mines his Alien franchise for time-tested, worn out, story tactics. Too bad. There were so many new goodies to play with; the meet-our-makers-premise, a wonderful cast of actors and a brand new space ship. It all seemed so intriguing. Gosh, you'd think Ridley had something fresh, inventive or even compelling to share.<br /><br />No luck. Once the premise is established, the film hunkers down along a seriously beaten path filled with boring team dynamics, confusing plot points, and - oddly enough - the same old, icky special effects. Are you kidding? A gooey creature-thing got in my space helmet and messed me up. Again? A creepy android's decapitated head carries on a conversation while laying on the ground. Again? Something's in my tummy and it's not looking good...AGAIN? Oh Ridley. Next time, could you at least do a rehash of Blade Runner? That's a trailer I'll definitely want to see.
B0098VXE50|5.0|Saw this on a transatlantic flight from Europe.  A great film.  A great cast.  Had to have it in my library of Myths, Legends and Fairy tales.  Not all great movies are Disney.
B007THA4FI|3.0|I bought this book because I loved the Harry Potter series and I wanted to see how well J.K. Rowling would transition to a adult focused book.  The writing was still good and the book flowed well but subject-wise it wasn't real exciting.  I am not sure I would buy her next adult focused book.
1439152802|5.0|Kate Morton always delivers a wonderful mystery filled with enchanting characters, family skeletons and plenty of twists and turns. She doesn't disappoint in The Secret Keeper. As Laurel begins to dig into her mother Dorothy's past, we are swept away to war-torn London, to the blitz and ghosts of the past.<br /><br />Morton has the uncanny ability to make you want to flip pages as fast as you can to get to the bottom of the mystery and also slow down and savor every word of her exquisite prose. She writes as if you are reading a fairy tale, but a delicious, mysterious fairy tale bound to leave you melancholy with what if's and of possibilities lost and found.<br /><br />Reading a Kate Morton novel gives you a new appreciation for detective work and as she throws you the tiny crumbs that will eventually lead to the final reveal, you the reader play mini-detective and try to piece all of the parts together, discarding possibilities, altering theories and expanding on ideas.<br />I had a few theories that changed as I read it but surprisingly I suspected the final big reveal, although there were a few loose ends that I needed filling in. Regardless, it took nothing away from my enjoyment; I loved every heart-pounding moment.<br /><br />The characters, as always, are sympathetic yet humanized, coming to life with every flip of the page. I particularly loved Laurel and Jimmy. Laurel especially gives voice to the doubts and theories that ran through my head. Jimmy is the quintessential good guy, you can't help but love him.<br /><br />Kate Morton does with aplomb what would be far-fetched and unbelievable with other authors. Her tales are full of mystery and twists and turns and she can leave you guessing until the final reveal. The Secret Keeper is available Today, October 16. Grab your copy, you won't be disappointed.
B004YM6JP0|5.0|I was all ready hooked on the series and this season was spectacular.  This disc set is great.  You get the Blue Ray and DVD versions-what more could you ask for?  The extras are fun to look at and there are several of these.  If you love Vampire Diaries-this set is for you!
1451627297|5.0|A combination of curiosity, and a watershed moment led Jake Epping through a rabbit hole and into 1958 in the gripping new novel by Stephen King.<br /><br />Jake Epping is a high school English and GED teacher. When he asks students to write about an event that changed their lives, he never thought it would change his. Jake's watershed moment occurs when he reads Henry Dunning's essay about the night his father came home and killed his mother, his sister and his brothers with a sledgehammer.<br /><br />Two years later Jake is summoned to a diner owned by his friend Al Templeton. Al, who looks as if he has aged 20 years overnight, explains the secrets of the diner's pantry to Jake. It is a portal into a particular day in 1958. You always go to the same date and time and no matter how long you are gone, only two minutes has elapsed in the present time. You will still age though, so if you spend two years in the past you will age two years (hence Al's appearance). Al is unable to continue what he has made his life's mission so he recruits Jake for the job - to go back to 1958 and stop Lee Harvey Oswald from firing the fatal shots that changed our world forever.<br /><br />I thought this book was going to be about a man trying to prevent John F. Kennedy's assassination and what the world would be like if he succeeded. I was wrong. It was so much more. I loved every page of this book, from the first line. While the meat of the novel is Jake's mission, the heart of the novel is the love story. It's about a time when life was simpler, people were more trusting, the air smells better and the food tastes better.<br /><br />Jake and Sadie are two phenomenal characters, both strong and well-written. They will go down in my own personal hall of fame. The supporting cast is just as good and the time period becomes a character in itself. It is clear how well researched this novel was. The history of that time, of Lee Harvey Oswald and JFK is fascinating.<br /><br />11/22/63 has been hailed as King's Tour de Force.  King does a phenomenal job of bringing the late 50's and early 60's to life. I also think it is his love letter to that era. I could envision myself in a full skirted dress doing the Lindy Hop and the Madison right along with Jake and Sadie. And isn't that a mark of a great writer, to be so engrossed in the story we feel we are right there with the characters?<br /><br />While I would have preferred a different ending, I know it is the only reasonable way this novel could have ended. But if time is elastic and different threads are being pulled at all times, maybe somewhere, somehow things are different, simpler. If you haven't read this novel, do it. It was one of the best books I have read in a long time.<br /><br />Read the alternate ending here and ball your eyes out all over again, I did.
B005LAIHY0|3.0|The purpose of Ridley Scott's film \\"Prometheus\\" apparently is to explain the origin of what was found on the hostile planet by the group of space travelers in the beginning of the original film \\"Alien\\" (1979).  The conclusion of \\"Prometheus\\" may be rather ambiguous to those not have seen it and seems to be setting us up for yet another sequel.<br /><br />There are, as expected, amazing optical effects compared to the earlier \\"Alien\\" films, but I had difficulty in becoming emotionally involved with  the characters in \\"Prometheus\\" as I did not in \\"Alien\\" and especially in the later film \\"Aliens.\\"  I have had the complete Alien collection for a couple of years now and  I still haven't gotten around to watching the third and fourth films in the series and possibly never will.<br /><br />I'm not sure why, but I am coming to regard \\"Bladerunner\\" as my favorite Ridley Scott sci-fi film.  In its odd way it perhaps creates characters and a universe you can believe.  The Blu-ray release of this film is especially impressive and greatly encourages repeat viewing.  While \\"Bladerunner\\" cannot boast of the technical sophistication of \\"Prometheus\\" there is an atmospheric aspect to \\"Bladerunner\\" that cannot be denied that \\"Prometheus\\" somehow lacks.
0425263908|5.0|Let's start by saying whether you liked Fifty Shades of Grey or not, you should read this book. I had mixed feelings about reading Bared to You because I saw it on a lot of sites/lists as a suggested book if you loved Fifty.  I'm glad I tried it out because I loved it.<br /><br />What Fifty lacks in terms of characterization and story-telling, Bared to You more than meets my expectations and that's all of the comparison I'm willing to give. I know others will make comparisons, but this book is so much more and should be reviewed as the standout it is.<br /><br />The characters of Eva Tramell and Gideon Cross are complex and multi-layered. Day only begins peeling their layers and leaves the reader with the heart pounding expectation of more. Eva is strong willed and determined. Although she is battling issues from her past, she is coping and she knows what she wants in the future. Gideon is equally complex, although his demons haven't been worked out, we know they are there. Gideon is used to getting what he wants and he wants Eva. He isn't a creepy male lead. He is determined, headstrong and of course he's hot as hell. He also respects Eva and her issues and he is willing to give her what she needs.<br /><br /> Eva is a recent graduate and she has moved to New York with her best friend Cary Taylor to start her career at an advertising agency. She meets Gideon in a chance encounter at the Crossfire building, the building they both work.<br /><br />Gideon begins his pursuit of Eva but makes it clear he doesn't have any inclination for anything more than a sexual relationship. Eva naturally balks, she is open to a friends with benefits arrangement but she needs more, such as knowing and respecting her partner. As Eva keeps denying Gideon, he wants her more and agrees to her demands. They begin a relationship that has both of them wanting more from the other and as their relationship progresses, Eva is forced to confront the demons of her past while knowing Gideon is hiding demons of his own.<br /><br />This is the first Sylvia Day book I've read and I will definitely check out her other works. She is a phenomenal writer. She gave the novel two incredibly complex and screwed up characters and she made them believable and lovable. Her writing style is fast-paced and she gives attention to the details.<br /><br />Yes, there is sex, lots of smokin' hot sex but that's not all this book is about. There are dinners and romance and there are the deeper emotional issues that Day zones in on which give the characters the intensity that is the heart of Bared to You.<br /><br />My final thoughts are I loved this book. I usually stay within the bounds of contemporary or regency romance and I'm so glad I stepped out and read this. I loved every minute of it and Reflected in You (the second book in the trilogy, due out in October) has now made its way to the top of my can't wait for list.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|I remember this game from the arcades and the annual fair and spent a lot of money on it! This app faithfully reproduces the game even being able to shake the machine! I've spent a few hours playing and I expect to spend many more!
030758836X|5.0|I loved the shifting perspectives of Nick and Amy. It gave more depth to the characters as well as the story and raises the bar in the guessing game of did he, didn't he. Nick's chapters focus on the disappearance and investigation while Amy's focuses on the backstory of their marriage.<br /><br />There are twists and turns, a few of which I expected but most of which I did not and Flynn does it so perfectly she just slides it in when you least expect it.  The writing is brilliant and edgy. Flynn is a powerful storyteller and takes an oft told story and shapes it into something great with layer after layer of intrigue and deception.<br /><br />At the heart of this book is a novel about marriage and love and how that can change over time and become something dark and far from the love and devotion it started as.<br /><br />Another aspect of the novel Flynn delves into is the media as judge and jury. In today's world, you can turn on the news and there is bound to be a story about a missing woman and the husband as the prime suspect. We've all seen Dateline but can the media skew our perspective, of course. Does it mean all husbands are guilty, no.  Nick appears guilty at times, in front of the camera and off, but just because he comes across negatively in the press, should we assume he killed Amy?<br /><br />I am finding it really difficult to talk about this book because I don't want to give anything away. All I can say is pick up this book and read it, you won't be disappointed, and it's well worth it. I hesitated for a long time before giving in, writing it off as something that wouldn't live up to the hype but in this case I was wrong, it deserves the hype, Flynn as proven she is a master storyteller and I'm looking forward to reading her other books.
0738212415|5.0|I bought this book about 5 months ago. I also bought a years worth of online lessons from Mark Kistler. He is such a fabulous teacher! I am 42 years old. In high school I had some interest in art, took a class, spent many hours trying to get the shading right on a sphere, cone, and cube. I labored over this for weeks and I was told my my teacher not to bother trying to draw. He crushed me. I never really did draw again, I wish I could but figured that I had no talent.<br /><br />When my son was young we watched \\"Imagination Station\\" and I would draw with him. It was fun. I let it go until this year. I had been thinking about joining the online classes for years and finally decided to. I am not sorry. I came online and bought his book also for some of the exercises are different from his online classes.  I have been working with this for 5 months now...my facebook page has shown my friends my journey, they always tell me how much they love my drawings. I also add Zentangles to them now.<br /><br />Mark teaches how to look at an object and get it to look realistic. It takes a lot of practice, and I am not very good at faces and eyes yet, but I am much better than I was 5 months ago. He writes things in such a way that you are inspired, you keep going. He also shows other artists work too so you can gauge how you are doing. I cannot recommend this book more!  I know when I need to brush up on something later on, this book is one I will come back to!<br /><br />This book is full of information and helpful hints on the basics and also beyond the basics, he covers shading, perspective, how to draw spheres, cones, open boxes, stacked boxes, how to make your drawings look 3-d, drawing flags, the human eye, faces also. He has in each lesson bonus challenges and also shows other adult artists works to give you an idea of where to place your shading until you can get it right on your own. There are lessons on how to draw the human hand, one and two point perspective. The wholeexperience is made richer by his encouragement throughout.
B0086700CM|5.0|I love this game its so fun.I think people who love twists turns and exiting things around the corner.It is really a good game and I recamend it.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|This book was thrilling and mysterious until the very last page. I have recommended it to all of my friends
B00933U1EU|4.0|While I said good idea, good acting, interesting plot for this episode, you really need to think of this as a series. I got stuck on the second one. Too much staring at the leading lady staring at a monitor -- in other words, not enough plot per minute. I am told that later episodes reverse this and have a ton of plot per minute. They lost me on number 2.
B005LAJ16I|5.0|Homeland was on for a year before I became curious after reading about it in New York Magazine.<br />It sounded fascinating. I watched it in a marathon of 2 days on Amazon. then purchased the DVD from Amazon to share it with people I am close to who I wanted to \\"catch up\\" to the September 30th Season to date.  It is intelligent, topical, gripping, plausible, always something unexpected, superb acting (that means that you are involved with the characters not the actors.  beautifully filmed, you feel as though you are right there with them.  I am very happy that I watched this as a marathon.  It more than met my expections, it exceeded them...Heather
B004LWZWGK|5.0|This was an incredible, emotional and epic thrill ride from start to finish. The culmination the Batman legend that began with Batman Begins. Everyone brings their A game here. The action is intense, the cinematography is absolutely stunning, the acting is top notch. A worthy addition to everyone's collection.
B007THA4FI|3.0|This book is very slow to get into.  A lot of back and forth with the characters so sometimes it  is hard to figure out who is who and whats going on.  Also instead of using basic names or easy to pronouce and remember names, she made up unusual and different names, which make it harder rather than easy reading.
B004SIIBGU|4.0|This seems to be a good app.  Haven't used it much and can't say more. I shop ebay often, so I'm sure it will get more use as time goes by.
B006M7JCC2|5.0|I heard this audio book multiple times, over and over again, each time finding and learning more. Then I bought the kindle version to read and highlight all the wisdmos in the chapters 14 through 18. Almost every sentence there is a priceless pearl.<br />This book is eye opening, awakening, enormously uplifting. After reading it you will never see yourself nor the rest of the world the same again. Thank you Anita for this book and all the suffering you went through so that this book could be written and help other people. Thank you Wayne Dyer for putting so much effort to introduce Anita to the world.

B007TBZ63Y|1.0|After a portion of the way through the book, the Kindle would either jump to the home screen or freeze. Customer service was very good in helping and refunded us for the book, but my daughter was very disappointed not be able to read the story as we even pre-ordered it.
B0094BB4TW|2.0|It shows about 15 posts then shows a few under it that has turned blue and it won't go any further. I just got it a couple weeks ago and have had no problems with it until now. The past few days it has started doing this. I re-installed it and it still doesn't work.
B000002G0P|5.0|This is the best album by the most misunderstood and greatest band of the 90's. Extreme are genius. Period. I say that without hesitation. The great songwriting, musicianship and showmanship. I saw 8 copies of this cd in a store, new, for 50 cents apiece, a year after it came out. I bought them all and gave them away to family and friends and demanded they love it. Queen fans love Extreme. Queen loves Extreme. That should tell you something. I love, love, love, love this band. I listen to a lot of different types of rock and music and pop, and Extreme is in the top 20 greatest bands of all time. Again, said without hesitation. Stop reading this and BUY IT. If you don't, I will assume you are a fan of Poser Boy Floyd. Thank you.
B009EANE3M|5.0|LOVE this album! Their music never ceases to impress me and I would recommend it to anyone who appreciates music.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I loved this story - all three books.  It was so heart warming that a strong respected man could be so broken.  Yes, there was a lot of sex, but it went with the story line.  It was Christians way of coping with his demons.<br />Ana was very atuned to his problems and was able to help him as no other could.  I have read the entire story twice and I am sure there will be a third time in the future.<br />I was very pleased with the story and highly recommend it to anyone.  My daughter talked me into buying the books and I am so happy she did.
B00466HM28|5.0|This is one of the best investments I have made in lately. I recommend all started to get this product. It's only 78 bucks for the mini midi which is insanely cheap. It's worth it trust me you won't be disappointed.
B008673ZAQ|3.0|The second book in this series was all over the place. I will wait for the the third before I pass judgement.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I think this was a nice introduction to a lifestyle that can be very dark. People who aren't afraid to talk about and enjoy sex should enjoy the series
B007UPNA6Y|3.0|Not up to his usual standard,It lacked the excitement and lacked beleivability in the final chapters. I have read all his previous books,and question if I received value for money

B008673ZAQ|5.0|I love this series but am really bummed they pushed the third book release date back 5 months from the original release date. HURYY UP already. I am so ready to read the next one :0)
0060873175|1.0|This book is an unbelievable waste of time. I am usually a Michael Crichton fan, however this book falls way short of expectations. I can't imagine that he had much influence in the actual writing because the dialogue is monotonous and even childish at times. The concept is nothing more than a combination of 1980's movies (see title of review) with interspersed biology terms with a predictable anticlimactic ending. The book was clearly published to meet a deadline and turn a profit.
B009AJDDQU|4.0|After all the hype it finally came to bluray. Needless to say it was a very good movie and with Ridley Scott attached to it you were almost guarenteed a good quality movie. The action was definitely there. The CG was incrdible and the acting was very well done. I won't spoil the end for you but, it does make sense as you watch it fade to black. Well worth the couple of hours you'll spend at home.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Loved it! Cannot wait for Entwined in you. I fell in love with the characters. The book was well written.
B009SJ46EA|5.0|Watched Season 1, loved it, love Jessica Lange, 'nuff said about Season 1.<br /><br />SPOILERS SPOILERS SPOILERS SPOILERS<br /><br />This first episode of \\"Asylum\\"...personally, it creeps the HELL out of me. Mental patients in 1964 in an asylum run by nuns, with a very sinister \\"Dr.\\" (James Cromwell) and a sketchy head Priest (Joeseph Fiennes) who has only sinister political ambitions, and head \\"Mother\\" played by Jessica Lange...seriously creepy.<br /><br />Honestly, I could care less about the current modern day thread with Adam Levine and whoever he's banging.<br /><br />But back in 1964...The inter-racial couple. Loved it. And if you don't like the whole \\"sci fi alien abduction\\" scenario...Google Betty and Barney Hill. 1961. One of the first widely publicized alien abduction accounts. GREAT on the writers.<br /><br />Don't like the whole \\"lesbian gets committed to Insane Asylum\\"? Sorry, dear. That really did happen. Homosexuality was finally declassified as a mental illness in 1973.<br /><br />Ok, enough with the spoilers. Buy it, rent it, watch it. SO CREEPY. On a par with the scariest movie I ever saw.<br /><br />And that's just episode 1, darlings...can not wait for Episode 2.
B007GCY8FS|5.0|Lee Child is up to his usual standard and creates a very interesting plot to keep you wanting to read more.  Can't wait for the next one in this thrilling series

B009NQKXYK|4.0|If you liked the 'Alien' movies, this is an excellent movie to watch. It does tie in a bit with the Alien series, but also functions well as a stand alone movie.<br />It will leave you with a few questions at the end, presumably to be answered in the sequel. It was entertaining and fairly realistic. They didn't go overboard on special effects.<br />Welcome back Ridley Scott.<br />I look forward to Blade Runner II
B009NPKTN6|1.0|The first ten minutes were painful, but I endured through 20, just for the sake of giving it a chance. I had to shut it off, just couldn't do it. It was that bad. And I like 80's music, by the way.

B004YM6JI2|5.0|I bought this for my husband because supernatural is his favorite series. It is a great series and I would highly recommend it to anyone that likes shows about vampires, monsters or demons. I like that it can have some comedy mixed in there too. I love the winchester boys, they remind me of my sons!
0761171703|5.0|I got my copy of dancers among us yesterday and I have to say Jordan has done his magic again. Fantastic photos, great quotes and I absolutely loved the stories behind the photos at the end! What a great book and an amazing project!

B008JGSM6G|5.0|its super to make work time go by quickly.  my Autistic niece really loved this and was very very good at this game
B005FITIK0|5.0|Everything about this movie is perfect. From the casting to the writing to the direction and acting, it's all here. There are no cliches, predictable happy ending where she \\"gets her man\\" or even a real clear sense of who the protaganist is. It is a very slow burn so if you are looking for gags and a quick pace this is not for you today, but come back to it when you want a movie that smacks of realism. If you are a writer, then you will definitely see yourself in this character.<br /><br />Theron is flawless as the lead character, hurtling toward 40, but with a clear case of arrested development who ironically makes a living writing \\"here today, gone today\\" teenage novels for readers who are the same age mentally as the author. She gradually becomes the character in her latest manuscript and just as the end of the series is inevitable, so too is her time in her home town.<br /><br />This movie works on so many different levels that you can definitely watch it twice and you can definitely watch the drink-driving scene over and over. It's hilarious!<br /><br />Recommended - 5 Stars.
B005IQZB14|5.0|I bought this book after hearing an interview with the author on NPR, and finished it just three days later, after reading it in every spare moment, even on my tiny phone screen standing in line.<br /><br />I have some backpacking experience and would love to hike the AT at some point, so I figured this book would help me better understand the world of the long distance hiker. But the book was so much more than a story about hiking. It was a story of life, loss, love, and what it means to survive.<br /><br />I cried more than once reading this book, and laughed, too. I felt like I was out there on the trail. This was probably the best book I've read this year.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|with its array of annoying tones, bells, jingles, and the option to use insanely difficult math problems (to the groggy mind) as the only way to stop it from screaming at you, this alarm app could wake the soundest of sleepers. Like myself.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|This was a great book! I think it broke away from what I expected and dug  into some deep topics. I loved every second and can't believe that I have to wait till New Year's Eve for the release of the 3rd book.

B008JGSM6G|5.0|this game is awesome. unlike many other free apps this one has more than twelve levels. in fact it has close to almost a thousand different levels. I don't think that I could ever get bored with it. its so addicting. I definitely recommend this game.
B0087JTAKW|1.0|I have read Tuesday's With Morrie & The Five People You Meet In Heaven which were my main reason for buying the book. I found the plot to be really thin. An overweight teenager wants to commit suicide & an ageing man with cancer wants to beat death. Enter Dor who takes them on a tour of past and present - the plot just smacks of Dicken's classic 1843 Novel A Christmas Carol with the Ghosts of Christmas Past, Present & Yet To Come showing Ebenzer Scrooge the error of his ways. Save your money and download a timeless victorian novel which is out of copyright but not out of date. Seems Time Flies but somehow stands still at the same time.
B0067TGSOK|5.0|The book is well thought out and practical. I found it quite helpful in setting up my own web business.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|great book,would recommend to anyone who likes to read. it holds your attention from start to finish. will read the rest of suzanne's works
B0083SBJXS|5.0|You can't go wrong with adding this movie to your collection.  It is timeless and leaves you feeling charged and hopeful that good will always triumph over evil. The cast is incredible!
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|Another great book by Rick Riordan! If you love the other books in the Heroes series you will definitely enjoy this latest installment. More secrets are revealed as we get closer to the final step in their quest.
B003F3NEBG|5.0|This movie is a timeless classic that will never go out of style.  Colin Firth is the best Darcy ever to portray this character.  I have watched this version of Pride & Prejudice so many times but never tire of it and always come away with something new that I learn about the characters. Great movie to enjoy on a rainy day curled up with your favorite blanket!
B008J9EYFG|5.0|Beth Orton really hit the mark with Sugaring Season.  The music is hauntingly beautiful and her voice is amazing.  The song Magpie is addictive. Her lyrics on songs like Candles, Poison Tree and Last Leaves of Autumn are intensely beautiful.  This is one collection of songs that you can listen to straight through and not have to skip over any selections.  I highly recommend Sugaring Season.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|John Green completely consumed me in this world. Everything about this story and the way it was written really moved me. I would recommend this to anyone. Short, sweet, and powerful. Make sure you have some tissues handy if you get emotionally invested in your reading. Wonderful. One of my favorites by far.
B009G78EE2|5.0|I've lived in the Seattle area for most of my 30 years, and have only recently gotten into the local rap/hip hop scene. I am glad I did; this album is OFF THE HOOK!!! I think my favorite track is \\"Can't Hold Us\\" ft. Ray Dalton, but it's really a tough call between that and \\"Same Love\\" ft. Mary Lambert. \\"Can't Hold Us\\" is upbeat and makes me feel like I need to get moving. It really gets me pumped up! \\"Same Love\\" is just....well, it's an extraordinarily well-written song, and it's impeccably executed to boot. I'm also pro marriage equality, and I can't thank the artists enough for putting this song out. Crossing fingers for Ref 74 to pass in 12 days!!!
B0063M22QO|1.0|You get so far in this stunningly simple game when you reach a 'lock' and can get no further.  I intend to send this 'game' back to the cloud permanently!
B009CPJHY4|4.0|Very entertaining and touching movie about how fleeting time is, regrets, new beginnings, loss and fullfilment. Probably better for older viewers who can relate more to a life lived rather than a life yet to be lived although the young Indian entrepenuner's line that every thing will be all right in the end demonstrates the optimism of youth and  in a broader sense mankind. It has an oakey finish with undertones of black currents and smoked porkchops.
0345803485|1.0|And not \\"bad\\" in a good way.  The writing is bad (repetitive, simple, boring).  The characters are one-dimensional.  The erotic parts are so-so.  And while it parades itself as a book about BDSM, in the end, it really kind of isn't.  It's a bit like a tease minus the payoff.  Without good writing, characters, or sex, there's not much reason to read this book.
B004QOB8SY|5.0|After watching season one of netflix...and falling absolutely in love with Sherlock and Dr. Watson and the new take on it...i could not wait until it made it to netflix..so i bought it..and was not disappointed ...it is fabulous!!
B009AJDDQU|5.0|I absolutely loved this movie had a great story to it Ridley did go back to his alien days a little but the movie is still great
B0094BB4TW|1.0|this app wont work on my Kindle fire.. when i 1st got my kindle it was working. whats the problem!
B006BGZJJ4|5.0|I was very pleased with the excellent service and fast shipping.  I had this cable two days after I ordered it.  I was able to charge my kindle right away.  My son was \\"watching\\" my puppy and the puppy chewed up my kindle cord while he was \\"watching\\" her.  He had her on a leash while he sat in the chair sound asleep and she chewed everything she could find.  Thanks for the great service.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|This is probably the best book in the series so far. I don't want to spoil it, but there are some pretty surprising (and funny) unexpected twists, especially with Percy and annebeth. The Romans and Greeks have a little spat at the beginning that throws off everything they had worked towards. What happens?<br />Read the book and find out.
B009RI4FRU|3.0|I love this movie and have been wanting to see it again! Got excited when I found out that I was able to rent it from Amazon and stream it from my computer. BUT very displeased with the quality. It looks great when it is small but as soon as you choose to make it full screen it gets all fuzzy. I felt that I was watching it as if it were downloaded and not from the real footage. I'm disappointed and I probably won't rent another movie from amazon again.
B009JZPH32|5.0|Just when you think this movie is over, it gives you another ten minutes of twist you don't see coming, I loved this movie and will be purchasing the combo pack.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Ever since author John Green wrote Looking for Alaska, I've been a fan. I've followed his works and read everything but Will Grayson, Will Grayson, which I hope to get to soon. Nothing has quite lived up to Looking for Alaska ... until now! I have to say that I was very, very pleased with The Fault in Our Stars. Green hits on several universal themes; Hazel and Gus (the main characters) will teach readers about the risky business of life and love and grief. Green holds true to his signature writing style ... smart writing that isn't dumbed-down for his young adult audience. He writes for teens the way they like to be treated, as capable and mature.
B008NABUU8|5.0|It can be fustarating but there is a way to have heavy trucks. Keeps me challenged but i like the reality of thr construction and stress points.
B0091REZMW|4.0|I just hidden object games. This game grabs hold of you and just won't let you put it down. I gave it four stars because if you run of energy u have either wait for more or pay money for it
B007R41E8O|3.0|the game is fantastic, but it keeps restarting itself randomly. very frustrating. beautiful graphics and storyline, though.  It would really be nice to play for long periods without restarting!!

B008673ZAQ|5.0|This a great follow up from the first book. I can't wait for the 3rd book. I really wanted to read it all in one day and almost did.
B008673ZAQ|4.0|Ok so when i read bared to you i literally rolled my eyes and said really??? it was like a knock off of fifty but with new names and a slight difference in traumatic stories.  however being the type of reader i am, i hate starting a trilogy & not finishing it. this second book definitely had me forget about comparing it to fifty shades. i was more interested and entangled with the events that happened in the second book. much more drama that keeps you wanting more.
B0087HT36U|4.0|a fairly fun game though some of the levels need a little work to get the geometrical actions right. graphics quality is really good for what it is.
B000Q66HBE|5.0|One of the greatest records of its time... Heart felt raw emotion and catchy riffs mixed with clean vocals is why I love this band Sooo much
B003Y74AXO|3.0|This is a basic screen protector made of a piece of plastic with a removable adhesive for the glass screen of the ipad.  PROBLEM:hard to install and unless you just got your ipad out of the box there will be bubbles.<br /><br />If you are fortunte enough to get all the bubbles out the functionality of the screen isn't obstructed unless the device is off (bubbles are easiest to see with a black background).
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Great book! Even got my parents to read it. cant wait till the movie adaptations come out for the sequels!
0307949508|4.0|To bad that there will only be 3 books in this trilogy.  The characters are very different but have amazing synergy.
B0090P0O70|4.0|The book has a lot of themes in it that are relevant still today. It's a really good book to use for debates with other readers.
B008AVYOBC|3.0|There is not much to say here. I have everything Bananarama has done, for official releases (no mention of unofficial). I think this CD is just dull. If you have ever heard of 'Cruel Summer' and go \\"Hey it is on this CD.. they have other songs toooooo!\\" then yes, you should purchase it. But I listened to this and realized.. these are not the songs I remember. I liked the Angel City remixes of just some.. they changed the song to a wow factor. To go back and here the originals - I don't know. But I am a die hard fan so it really is different if you hear other versions. Buy the CD if your only listen was in high school (umm they lasted longer than most of US) to Venus (\\"yeah they sung that song when we were cheerleaders....\\")....<br /><br />The Videos Disc<br />Buy this disc for that alone. Period. Take a look at what they did overseas (in some cases) with their music via video. Get the CD/DVD combo, fan or just like a few songs - get it.
B00846REIS|5.0|I think this is a fantastic book...one you don't want to put down. I love this series and can't wait for the third book...actually really bummed it won't be out until later this next year. Don't want to wait that long! If you like 50 Shades, you'll like this too. I'd even say this book is better and has a better story.
B0097C8XL0|3.0|well at first this game was really fun and no advertisements popped up but then I got of for a little bit then I got back on and it started messing up and advertisements the game started skipping. I would sortof recommend this

0525953728|5.0|Phenomenal book from start to end. I admit, I am not a reader and I could not put the book down. I wanted to read it from start to finish as soon as I picked it up. Reading the account of what actually happened was fascinating. It gives a small peek into the life of DEVGRU; a group of elite Patriots willing to carry out any mission asked of them. I thoroughly enjoyed reading it from start to finish & what the author has decided to do with his portion of the proceeds is admirable.<br /><br />I would strongly recommend this as a must read for all. I have since re-read the book 2 more times & am not someone who reads recreationally. Just a hint to those purchasing, take a peek at the pictures and diagrams that have been placed in there before reading the respective sections. It will help you paint a better picture as far as visualizing the raid
B005HSL626|2.0|I got this app I played it a lot I love it but every time I try to open this app it says it is loading then it goes back to my kindles home page.
B008Y6YEQS|4.0|Very good remake of the original.  Jayden Smith carries this movie well and the Chinese actors perform superbly as well.
B0086700CM|5.0|I dont know why everyone says such negative things about this game I think it is pretty awesome. it dose some really. cool things.
B000068QVN|4.0|\\"Live - The 1971 Tour\\" has much better sound than Live Album and a terrific rockin version of Footstompin Music but the concert isn't as good as Live Album and not quite as much energy - was never a big fan of Hooked On Love and Get It Together and Live 1971 really could use \\"In Need.\\" Note: the live version of \\"In Need\\" on the new Closer to Home album is awesome and much better than the one on Live Album. Still recommend Live 1971 slightly over Live Album due to the better sound quality here.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I have never been much of a reader. But, once I picked up the book I couldn't put it down. Now I am half way done with book 2 Fifty Shades of Dark. Then, I'm sure on to book 3!
0761169253|4.0|An excellent short read.  Well written and fun.  Positive and upbeat with the advantage of being something I'll put on the shelf and probably want to reread later.  It's a smaller book and an overview read, if you are looking for a book with a ton of information it may not be for you.
0345803493|2.0|In a few words, no. After setting the first book aside after a few chapters, debating wether to finish it or not, I decided to continue so I could understand what all the hype was about. Really, Anna knew what Christian was from the beginning but she still kept going back? Talk aboout fairy tales.<br />  Ok, so I finished the first book and had to read the second to see how long Anna would put up with Christian's crap. Frankly, I found all the drama in the second book exhausting. It left me feeling drained and almost abused myself. But still, I read on. After finishing the third book, I found myself saying...SO WHAT... WHO CARES!<br />It left me feeling empty and sad for Anna who deserves so much better. OK, so he's filthy rich and she'll never want for material possessions but money can't buy peace of mind or self respect.<br /><br />  For those of you who chose to read the Fifty Shades to it's end, I recommend reading the parody \\"Fifty Shames of Earl Grey\\" by Fanny Merkin (a.k.a. Andrew Shaffer) immediately after. You'll have a few good laughs and be able to get the bad taste out of your mouth (pun intended) that Fifty Shades leaves behind.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|I loved reading the book.. great idea. shame that the ending is very simple. could have been much better. .
B008GVD6D8|5.0|I remember when i finished 'Bared to You' and i was waiting for this book to come out. I have to say it was worth the wait and i'm now waiting for the next book. I reckon this series so far is better written and has a more solid plot than the 'Fifty Shades Grey' series, yet has not had as much of a rap. If you enjoyed the Fifty series you will love this series.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|The game is fun and challenging,  and all of a sudden  you realize you've been playing for WAY too long.
0316228532|2.0|I gave this book a shot, plowing through the first chapter, but gave up. Got tired of the soft porn and profanity. Really, you can write a good adult book without that junk.
B005Q1W10A|5.0|Simply the best.<br />Now we need the next season.<br />My wife and I enjoy this series so much but it is painful to have to wait for each new season.
B000YDAYCW|4.0|The boot/shoe is basically what I expected. Quality is typical of Timberland. Fit is not uniform as with other Timberland shoes I currently own.  Difference noted. Excellent delivery time as always with Amazon.
B007S3S8HO|5.0|This review is made based on a sample provided through the Amazon Vine program.<br /><br />My 12 year-old son and 6 year-old granddaughter played with this toy.  Both love Angry Birds.  Our son also loves Lego.  I don't think they ever actually built based on the instructions, but they had a lot of fun building different structures, and then flinging the birds at them.  It is possible to build something that is too sturdy for the bird to break, which was frustrating for the 6 yo.<br /><br />One thing to note is that the bricks don't work well with other brand bricks (Lego or Mega Blocks.)  It's not a problem for having fun with them, just something to be aware of.<br /><br />I'd recommend this to anyone who wants a real world Angry Bird experience.
B004JN1D2I|5.0|I got into the Game of Thrones world by watching the series and I thought that nothing could surpass them, but after having read the first few chapters of a Song of Ice and Fire series I realised how mistaken I was. It is an excellent book for those who like a good reading and entertaining as well, I totally recommend it.
B008NEMPTO|5.0|I bought the 3D version of \\"Abraham Lincoln Vampire Hunter\\" and I had so much fun watching this movie!<br />The 3D is good and the movie was definitely entertaining, I would recommend this to others who own a 3D TV.
B005G5PPGS|2.0|This book is more about statistics than baseball. I found it somewhat boring. I was hoping more of a baseball story using the moneyball theory.

B003IDMUWC|4.0|This is my second read of a time to kill, the other being when it was first released. It,s still a good read, one of his better works.Having read all but a few of Grishams books, I have concluded that his earlier efforts were much more readable and interesting than his books of the last five years. I have not read the Racketeer but will as soon as the Kindle price falls to realistic levels. A Time To Kill -- a good book --a good Movie.
B009MCRHH6|5.0|I love this game the first time I saw this game on the app store I was so excited to get it totally worth $4.99
0375507256|5.0|This book starts off difficultly - know that going into it. The first section plops you down into the middle of a journal entry. The style of writing is old-fashioned and difficult for our modern tastes, and there are characters and events that are referenced from previous pages in the journal that we never got to read. Because of the style of writing in this and the sixth section, I'd say this novel is not for the light reader, or those who only stick with \\"airport\\" or \\"summer reading\\" type novels. But for people who actually like to think about meanings beyond simple events, this book will not disappoint.<br /><br />As already mentioned the initial style of the book is fairly difficult (Melville-esqe according to the author), but is completely different from the style of the second section, which is again completely different from the style of the third section, and so on through each of the different parts of the book. By the second section I was incredibly impressed that the same author had written such dissimilar styles, and by the end of the book I was pretty much blown away.<br /><br />As far as the actual story itself goes, it is really quite complicated, and you are not ever going to get concrete answers to some of your questions. For ease of reading, I actually followed along two different websites while I was reading this book: one was basically giving me footnotes about some of the references (and there are many) in the book which I may or may not be aware of. The other website I used was a sort of on-line book club, which let me read other people's thoughts/perceptions of each section of this book. And I am glad I did, because there is so much contained here that I would never have picked it all up on my own. Some of the most striking parallels you probably won't catch until subsequent read-throughs, and this book is the first book in a long time that I considered re-reading the moment I finished it.<br /><br />If you're looking into this book because of the movie, don't expect it to be the same. The novel flirts with the reincarnation idea (one character believes this to be true of herself), but never states that this is the case. In fact, in some ways it actively negates this idea (aside from one character denouncing reincarnation as \\"silly\\", it's actually physically impossible time-line-wise for two of the characters (or those around them) to be reincarnated versions from the previous section). If you are expecting a Tom Hanks/Halle Berry type of romance, forget it. The book doesn't have a single romantic plot within it (note: there are characters who are in love with other characters, but it is never pivotal to the main point of any section). If, instead, you are hoping for a book which will provoke thought and keep you entertained along the way, you could not go wrong with Cloud Atlas.
B0063GORYU|5.0|This game always makes me relax at night before I go to bed. Very fun and challenging to boot! Its the best card game out there in my opinion.
B009F879HK|5.0|I bought three copies from my local record store. One that i can play whenever i want, one that i plan on framing just because i like the idea of framing a replica of the very first beatles single - the single that started it all (yeah, yeah its not the original, but it sure will look nice up on my wall!), and one that i am keeping as part of my collection that will not get played. Hopefully they do these 50th anniversary releases for all the singles. Then i will have a complete, unplayed collection of these 50th anniversary re-issues! (Crossing my fingers for that!!) I had originally ordered it before it got recalled, but my order got cancelled. Then I preordered it again on amazon when they put it back on sale but they ended up pushing back the second release date by a couple days so i thats why i just went to buy them at the record store instead - which turned out to be good because they had it for a cheaper price! Thats why i got 3 for the price that i had initially gotten the preorder for on Amazon for two!
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|This is a great game. Each level gets harder and harder. Great way to kill time. The graphics are great too. Lol
B003VANOFY|4.0|Worked out of the box, great for VOIP.  With the laptop upstairs, I was able to walk around the basement and continue a conversation without any issues.  Only critique is the lack of cushion around the ears, kind of cheap.
B008M87GJK|5.0|runs beautifully on the kindle fire, no ads, adjustable regions for stories. I love listening to the BBC on the radio, so it's nice to see such a well designed app
B009HV2JT8|4.0|I think to compare this to the book, you will be extremely disappointed. Look past that, try to forget everything about the book, and it turns out to be a good action movie. I feel like if they had got more of the book in there it would have killed in the \\"box office\\", oh well. If you haven't read the book, maybe watch the movie first then read it.
B001RTSPVY|5.0|Dear Fans of BB, Well Season 2.... was the bomb~ This series leaves you craving for more episodes. I'm a full blown BB addict~ been thinking about making blue rock candy as gag gifts for the holiday season~ The characters are much more in depth in Season 2., than Season 1. Don't hesitate in watching this! Thanks, Sue
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|very fun and challenging. quite a lot of levels and almost endless replay value. i have been playing non stop since i purchesed it
B007P6VLRS|5.0|I'm a fan of old and I wanted to pick this one up.  I'm very pleased with the album.  This is the most I've felt a SP album in years.  Beautifully crafted songs.  Well done.  I'd rather kick my own face than lie.  This is the most Smashing Pumpkins I've felt from smashing pumkins in a long long time.  I didn't like Zwan or Zeitgeist that much.  This I really enjoy.
B000HC2LI0|5.0|I got this as an amazon deal of the day and as a Christmas gift! I saved so much money I can afford to add to the gift and my sister is going to love it!
B008HK3XYK|4.0|I bought this because this one was the cheapest (in terms of price) available case for Kindle Fire HD when they released Fire HD. I have no choice but to love this product.<br /><br />The case is not that heavy compared to other cases. My old Fire case makes it heavy.<br /><br />It is presentable. It looks elegant. Nice stitching and materials.<br /><br />The only thing I don't like about this case is that you have to remove or change the device position when charging. You can't stand it horizontally.
B0096PAA6E|2.0|The hype I heard about Gary Clark Jr was \\"the next great blues guitarist\\", so I was hoping for some good blues. He does sound talented to me, but selections seemed to totally miss the mark for blues and either leaned towards pop-ish jazz types of songs and heavier rock with a fair amount of distortion.
B007FEFLTO|3.0|A great writer who rambeles through the time period. There was a lack of a good story arch. Carla was engaging as the nurse. Difficult to follow the interconnections of characters. I will buy future books of this author because of past experience. To the credit of the author the time leading up to the war was a sharp comparison of todays time period.This comparison was subtle and chilling.Glad I read the book just not a Pillars of the Earth.
B009KHDT0C|3.0|I really dislike it when previews distort the tone or general plot of a flick. Dark Shadows is one of the flicks. Thought it was a comedy based on the previews? You'd be forgiven for thinking so. Did you think Johnny Depp was a vampire acclimating to modern times in a family of vampires that were somehow related to him? You'd be wrong as I was. Seriously, deceptive previews need to end, but I guess they exist to mask semi-funny plot-thin flicks like this that offer very little that's new and interesting.<br /><br />The time to see it? Two years from now, around Halloween, on TV during a Sunday afternoon after your team's football game with two beers in you, wavering between a nap and whatever's on TV. This is your 'whatever'.
B009G78EE2|5.0|Really a fantastic album. If you haven't already checked it out, consider it highly recommended. Also, I would suggest the explicit version, as I'm not sure some of the songs would have the same 'oomph' as some sort of radio edited version (Anyone remember Ceelo's wonderful anthem, *ahem*, 'Forget You'? Exactly.)
B005HEW7LY|3.0|Harry Kim and Tom Paris are on a mission on the planet Benean to have a key navigation system repaired.  Tom is accused of murdering the top scientist/professor who is helping them fix the device.  The motive to the crime is that older professor has a beautiful and younger wife that Tom falls for.  Tom is sentenced in the Benean's way of punishment and is forced to relive the last moments of his victims life and death over and over.<br /><br />Janeway asks Tuvok to prove Tom's innocence before the conviction penalty destroys his mind and his sanity......<br /><br />This episode is just OK to me as it did not really involve much Sci-Fi.  It is more of mystery theatre style of program and while it was good it is not what you are expecting from a good Star Trek episode.  I rate this as a three star episode.  You should watch it but it was just average for me.
B0052RDHTM|5.0|I'm completely enjoying reading this epic of the lead up to & the events happening during World War I.  My husband's father & my father were both soldiers in the US Army, so it's interesting for me to hear how things were happening in the various countries involved.  I can't wait to get to the next volume to see where that takes us.  I've always enjoyed Ken Follett's book and this one is a real winner.
B005HEVY54|4.0|As Voyager is going through the Delta Quadrant another spacecraft is coming to meet Voyager. The alien ship is sending out a distress call, not because they are in distress but because the Voyager is in distress in the alien captain's words. The other ship's captain wants to come aboard, bring gifts and make an offer they can't turn down.<br /><br />They are from the planet Sikaria and he offers that they come to their planet and have a vacation and take shore leave.  Captain Janeway easily agrees and the Sikarians offers the crew gifts. They want Janeway and the officers to stay on the planet for dinner as their guests. Kim has met a woman who is a scientist and they hit it off. She takes him to the woods and wants to hear his stories which are considered an entertainment treasure on their world. The suns come up and two suns rise in the morning sky and Kim realizes that they are on a different planet.  They teleported 40,000 light years in less than a second......<br /><br />Living by the Federation Prime directive suddenly has a different meaning when the crew realizes they are the race with inferior technology.  What they refuse to give to other needy races is now denied to them and it could save the crew decades of travel on the way home.  This is a good episode with a good storyline.  It was interesting to see the shoe on the other foot so to speak.  This episode is a 4 star one and it is worth watching.
B009HSVHV2|5.0|This album takes us back to the old KISS of Destroyer and Hotter Than Hell Fame. This is a can't miss purchase for any KISS fan. KISS fans have been waiting a long time for an album like this.
B005HEWJVW|4.0|The crew thinks that they have discovered a new element that is extremely dense and would create a super strong spacecraft hull that would be indestructible.  The element is located in the asteroid rings of a very large planet in the solar system ahead of them.  The material is in some caverns inside of the asteroids. When they beam into the caverns they find that the caverns are filled with webs and hundreds of dead humanoid bodies wrapped in the same webs.<br /><br />Torres, Kim and Chakotay find the bodies and while they are examining them a dimensional subspace opening occurs and lights up the cavern. For safety reasons they are transporting to the Voyager at the same time and Chakotay and Torres arrive but Harry Kim is missing and replaced by a dead alien body on the transporter pad.......<br /><br />This is not a bad story and it leads to the insight of an alien religious belief and how it affects their behavior and culture.  It is worth watching and it is a fairly good story.
B00910Y1OQ|1.0|first, I really like this game, but am getting more upset that I cannot play it due to the fact it will not open! please fix, I will gladly change stars to five after!
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|This movie is one of the greatest movies of all time. It's funny, very well made, and remains interesting the whole time. It's quite long but it never gets boring. Everything about it is fun and enjoyable.

B007IXWL2C|2.0|I have mixed reviews about this trilogy. I didn't really enjoy book 1, it started slow and it didn't hold my attention. I only read book 2 because I had already started the trilogy so might as well finish it right....Book 2 in my opinion is the best out of the 3. Book 3 is very predictable...All in all I wouldn't recommend it.
1451620829|5.0|Want to know how much Peter was being paid per show on the Reunion Tour? Want to know about Ace's big lie to Peter that permanently damaged their friendship? Or maybe you want to play a game and count how many times Peter mentions \\"Gene\\" and \\"herpes\\" in the same sentence throughout the book. Surprisingly, this is a pretty raw and honest account of Peter's life and career, and is definitely the best KISS bio to date. Peter spares no one, including himself. If you're a long-time KISS fan, you'll find that the venom he has for Paul and Gene runs pretty deep, but you can also definitely see why they referred to Peter as the \\"complainer.\\" But Peter also holds himself over the fire - you learn how he blew through all of his KISS money (then AND now), destroyed his marriages, got lost in drug and alcohol abuse in and out of KISS, was suicidal many times, etc. And even post-KISS, you learn how much the failure of his solo album a few years ago almost did him in.<br /><br />Peter really sticks it to Gene, Paul, Doc McGee, Tommy, Ace, his ex-wives, etc., but he backs it up with interesting, never-before-heard (for the most part) stories. As a longtime fan, I often found myself reading passages and thinking, \\"I can't believe he put that in print.\\" The only people that really seem to be spared are Gigi (and you learn that that relationship hasn't always been smooth sailing either), Chris Lendt (I don't think I've ever read a bad word about Lendt from anyone), his daughter and a few close friends and family. And it was interesting to read how Peter's own parents got pissed at him about his marriage to Deb, how he treated them at times, etc.<br /><br />The one thing you'll appreciate about this book is its honesty. As a long time KISS fan, you want to feel bad for Peter, but you learn he was/is his own worst enemy. He takes the blame for most of his problems, and you don't see that often (and certainly not from any current or former KISS members). The bottom line is this: You will love this book. Period. You can tell Peter is a very, very passionate and emotional guy. Whereas Gene seems oblvious to his demons, and Ace is a conman to his demons, Peter is almost like a kid who screws up and says, \\"I don't know what I was thinking.\\" And you get the impression he really doesn't, and he battles his demons day in and day out trying to find happiness.<br /><br />So if you're expecting a happy-go-lucky, everything-was-great romp through the KISS years, buckle-up...this ain't it. This is a sometimes depressing, raw account of what the Catman went through as the drummer of The Hottest Band In The World. And even though it seems to have a happy ending, you can't help but think that this story isn't over yet...And what makes it such a great read is you feel the danger that is Peter Criss' life. You're just hoping his final bow will be a happy one.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|it was amazing beautiful and emotional . It had something that kept me reading it  had a zing to it
B007J4T2G8|1.0|It doesn't have much of a plot.  Mainly a virgin with a reality that is not normal.  How many people out there are really like that.
B009GEOLM4|1.0|When we purchased this film we thought we were purchasing the actual movie that was in the theater. When we realized it was animated we weren't able to get our money back. Taught us a big lesson, WATCH THE TRAILER PRIOR TO PURCHASE!!!<br />Prob was an ok film if your a kid who likes comic books?
B000RIWAVW|5.0|An instant classic that made you fear a man with a white mask and blue jump suit. It never gets old.

B000KKPN5C|5.0|The compact size of the SB-400 is welcome for most applications. It couples automatically to most Nikon DSLRs through the built in hot shoe. No unsightly or intermittent wires to worry about. Operation is simple. Turn it on and that's it. The camera exposes each frame automatically as accurately as the camera does without a flash. The front lens of the unit tilts up for bounce flash without any adapters. Just flip it from the bottom to any angle up to 60 degrees. The shoe adapter is metal and provides a rugged, lockable attachment to the hot shoe.<br /><br />The SB-400 speedlight may only offer a one stop advantage over the built in flash of most Nikon DSLRs, but it's how even the light is that makes it worthwhile. The larger light panel produces more even lighting across the image, with softer, less harsh shadows. The extra light height allows a lens hood to be used without casting a shadow in the lower part of the screen as the built in flash is known to do. Also, the extra flash height reduces red eye.<br /><br />Another big advantage is the freedom from using your camera battery up too fast. You'll be able to shoot the full 450 photos with a single camera battery charge, vs under 250 if you use the on board flash.  This flash recycles faster than the on board flash, allowing flash photos to be fired off closer together.  The SB-400 uses two AA batteries for over 200 shots, and you can replace them without removing the flash from the shoe.<br /><br />The SB-400 brings even lighting to your photos in a simple to use, lightweight, automatic, inexpensive package.
B001AQMBHI|5.0|The movie that started the franchise off, can't go wrong with the first one. Crazy scenes and action packed, got to love it.
B003YL4LYI|1.0|I'm reading it just because I rode a long long way to get where I am and do not want to surrender. Still, sadly this is going to become the last volume I read: too many characters split over an even bigger land. Maps, city names, subplots to be considered and worst than all I also have to catch up with a broken timeline as this volumes is partially contemporary to \\"A feas for crows\\". Maybe after all I can't take it anymore: also the style appears to be lower in quality and the characters are plain and repeat themselves. Sorry ppl, me neither knew it could end this way.
B008CLI4N4|4.0|The video represents Martin's book very well.  The acting and scenery is superb.  The book and video is violent and graphic but I am a bit sensitive to these kinds of things.  I believe that it probably represents the barbaric lifestyles of the era.  However, I would not let anyone but an adult read or see these stories.  Martin is a skillful writer and very entertaining or I would not have been interested in this at all.
B008B0QH5S|2.0|I am a huge fan of PSB.  I have all their CD's, DVD's and limited editions.  I've listened to Elysium a number of times thinking it would grow on me but it has not and it is simply a huge disappointment.  I can only wonder what they were thinking, if anything at all.  It lacks the depth and soul of all their previous recordings.  Ego Music is just too painful to listen to and the other tracks not much better.  Sorry, but I cannot endorse it.
B004UID2LC|1.0|worked great until the update. Recently deleted it because it wouldn't let be download let alone view a video. If it ever gets fixed I would gladly download it again.

B004VMUS9G|5.0|It does what it's supposed to do! It's more reliable then my cell alarm, I don't know what I would do without my backup alarm.
B003NX76BM|3.0|The Search by Nora Roberts was okay. The search and rescue training was interesting. The book was just too long.<br /><br />It kept my interest but a little too much sex.
B007MDB6L0|4.0|My daughter, who is 7 kept telling me she was nervous to watch this show because Tink kept doing everything that she wasn't supposed to do.  This is funny, because I was just enjoying it, thinking what a good job they've done on this intallment.  But then I realized, she is right.  What's up with the disobedience?  I try and teach my children to come to me and we can talk about something if they disagree with it.  Communication to me, is very important.  I teach my children that we have rules for a reason.  So, despite the fact that I think this was quite a good movie, I wish there were some things that were different.  There is far too much sneaking around and doing things that are against the rules.  I know this would have made the movie, as it is, impossible to make, but...I really don't want my kids to get the idea that if they disobey the rules and sneak around behind my back that great things will happen...because unfortunately that's not always the case.<br /><br />Still, besides my fuddyduddyishness ***word?***, I did think the characters were cute and I liked that they worked together in the end to save the day.  I enjoy a fiestier Tink, and in this one, she's all sweetness.  The animation is excellent and it's visually a beautiful show. It's also great for the imagination.  My children are now running around playing fairies.  So, I gave it 4 stars.  I will still let my girls watch, it will just lead to more family discussions on why we have the rules we do and I'll just keep up the communcation with them when they would like something to be different.
B006RXQ27O|5.0|I remember watching this movie as a kid and felt the other night like some wacky cartoon fun. I was delighted to see Amazon Streaming had it available and couldn't resist watching it. From the random cartoon cameos to the antics you would have always imagined if you were placed in a cartoon-esk world, Who Framed Roger Rabbit is one of the best movies available.
B00571F26Y|5.0|Every person should read this book-eat more greens and omit wheat from our diet.  Genetically altered foods can<br />leave us nutritionally starved. Its no wonder we are always hungry.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|Things did not end like I would have thought!! Turns and twists you will never see coming!! It was a great trilogy!!
B008JAGZDE|4.0|This movie was suprisingly really good and funny.  It's what you would expect from the American Pie series and it was great to see the all of the original cast grown up.  I'd recommend it if you are in need of a good laugh or two.
0525953728|4.0|It is a good book if you like military story.<br />For those I recommend this book and [[ASIN:1591146682 Project Azorian: The CIA and the Raising of the K-129]]<br />They are quick to read books

B005LAJ16I|5.0|Homeland from Amazon, great TV show. Nicely done on DVD. The acting is good the story line is good, the sex is excessive. Wish there were more like this. There are some old PBS show most likely from England that should be added. As an example \\"In search for the Nile\\" and \\"Coldest Place on Earth\\"
B008ALAHA4|5.0|Love that Apple keeps innovating, but really didn't want to buy an extra adapter for my 2012 Macbook Pro.  This works great.  I can use my old adapter for an extra and link up with my Apple monitor.  Great product.
B000LXHK2C|5.0|Candy for the eyes & soul.  Scott & Crowe together again -- Bravo!!!  I love this movie it is a perfect follow-up to Peter Mayle's \\"A Year in Provence.\\"  The character's are perfect, the dialogue snappy, scenery out of this world, and a wonderful way to spend a couple of hours.  The women are all perfectly cast; each one bringing along Crowe's character (Max Skinner) in his metamorphosis from tough stock executive to taking on life in a much kinder & loving fashion.  Freddie Highmore as young Max is a wonderful match to Albert Finny's Uncle Henry.  Everyone should have an Uncle Henry!  Even the dog is so typical & loving.<br /><br />I don't understand the panning by critic's of this delightful film, however I hardly ever agree with them.  Movies, books, music & art are all in the eyes of the beholder.  I didn't like \\"Titannic,\\" but I loved the music.  We all choose from our own perspective what makes us feel good - - - \\"A Good Year\\" has a lot to offer in its' backdrop & story line.  If Hollywood would make more movies which had these ingredients I would be at the movie theater more often.  Even my husband liked this one & he hasn't been to a movie in many, many years.<br /><br />Loving, laughing, some sadness (not too much), but plenty of life to be enjoyed.
0321811984|5.0|A library is a great place to check out books. Not only can you check them out to read, you can check them out before you eventually buy.<br /><br />Such is the case for me with Presentation Zen 2nd Edition revised and updated by Garr Reynolds. I read the 1st edition as a checked out book from the library a few years ago. I had been to a conference and had been amazed by the presentations. Instead of death by power point, I became a visual learner. Even more I became an engaged advocate. I wanted to begin to learn how to create presentations that brought people to life and action. I am in the resurrection business.<br /><br /> I can't tell you the specific differences between edition 1 and edition 2 except there seemed to be a bit more depth and mroe examples.<br /><br />While I love Garr's own insights, I appreciate his willingness to include others. Guy Kuwasaki writes or presents the perfect foreword or perhaps now its forepicture of Presentation Zen. Seth Godin. Nancy Duarte and others along with Garr gives the best practices / best picture view of presentations.<br /><br />Garr's insights are simple ideas on presentation design and delivery. Most importantly he taught me to think through first the message i want to share and the response I seek, even before I look for the pictures I want to show.<br /><br />And when picture time comes, rule of thumb is no more than 6 words per slide. Once you embrace this rule, it makes it tough to watch presentations with more than 16 words per slide and not muttering under your breath, \\"Death by Powerpoint\\".<br /><br />I give Presentation Zen 5 out of 5 stars. Garr provided a great introduction and overall process to developing presentations. It's a guide I return to again and again.
0393088774|5.0|Krugman makes it clear in the kind of prose that even middle school students can appreciate that what we need now is more spending not less. The problem for most of us is that we think about the US government's finances in the way we think about our household or small business finances. If we spend more than we take in we are in trouble. However the US economy as a whole doesn't work that way and neither does the government. As Krugman observes in reference to why we are still in what he calls (variously) \\"a slump,\\" \\"a great recession,\\" and in the title, \\"a depression\\": \\"...your spending is my income and my income is your spending.\\" He asks, \\"if ordinary citizens are tightening their belts--spending less--and the government also spends less, who is going to buy American products?\\" (p. 28)<br /><br />So the solution to our economic problem, Krugman insists, is not austerity (which might work for households) but the opposite. We need the government to spend money to create jobs so that people can buy other people's goods and services. We especially need some infrastructure building here at home instead of in the Middle East.<br /><br />\\"Collectively,\\" Krugman asserts, \\"the world's residents are trying to buy less stuff than they are capable of producing, to spend less than they earn. That's possible for an individual, but not for the world as a whole. And the result is the devastation all around us.\\" (p. 30)<br /><br />The other thing to understand about governments, especially huge governments like the US with a $15-trillion a year economy is that government intervention can smooth out a crisis. This is because the US will not run out of people to buy its debt since its tax base is so huge that the risk of default is miniscule. When the economy gets back on its feet tax revenues will increase and the debts will be paid. Well, not paid in full. That is unlikely to ever happen, since it makes little sense. To borrow to buy something you don't need like luxuries is not wise. (Wars are usually luxuries for governments.) But to borrow to help grow the economy is a fine investment. Sound companies borrow because borrowing allows them to take advantage of their knowhow in producing goods and services that people will buy allowing the company to make money. Borrowing to party big time to impress the neighbors or your girlfriend grows no wealth. (Wars are sometimes shock and awe parties for heads of state looking to stay in power.)<br /><br />Aside from offering the solution to our economic woes in simple, straightforward terms, Krugman also does an outstanding job of explaining how we got into this mess in the first place. I've read several books and a number of articles explaining the mortgage crisis, the \\"too big to fail\\" bank welfare fraud and the derivatives hustles, but nowhere is this spelled out in as clear as fashion as Krugman does here. He is simply the best economist writing for an informed non-professional public at work today. This is not to mention that he is also a Nobel Prize winning economist.<br /><br />As for wages being too high, Krugman writes:<br /><br />\\"...today it's often argued that more labor market `flexibility'--a euphemism for wage cuts--is what we really need\\" (to cure high unemployment). \\"But while an individual worker can improve his chances of getting a job by accepting a lower wage, because that makes him more attractive compared to other workers, an across-the-board cut in wages leaves everyone in the same place, except for one thing: it reduces everyone's income, but the level of debt remains the same. So more flexibility in wages (and prices) would just make matters worse.\\" (pp. 52-53)<br /><br />I think the average person, even the fairly well educated average person, doesn't really understand how banks work and how they make money. I didn't until I was well into my fifties. Certainly the core of the Tea Party doesn't, although some of the supporters of financial institution deregulation do and that is precisely why they want deregulation. Here's how Krugman explains this in part:<br /><br />First he notes that the Glass-Steagall act of 1933 primarily did two things. It \\"established the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) which guaranteed (and still guarantees) depositors against loss if their bank should happened to fail\\" (p. 59) Additionally, \\"Glass-Steagall limited the amount of risk banks could take. This was especially necessary given the establishment of deposit insurance, which could have created enormous `moral hazard.' That is, it could have created a situation in which bankers could raise lots of money, no questions asked--hey, it's all government-insured--then put that money into high-risk, high stakes investments, figuring that it was heads they win, tails the taxpayers lose.\\"<br /><br />Krugman then reminds us that this is exactly what happened during the savings and loan scandal of the Reagan administration. Likewise, the big investments banks knew during the later years of the George W. Bush administration that they were in fact too big to fail and the government in order to prevent a massive financial meltdown would have to bail them out if their Pandora's Box of risky derivatives (and other \\"financial instruments\\") went toxic. This knowledge gave them free rein to gamble like drunken sailors--well, that knowledge and the (how sweet it is!) deregulation of investment banking that took place primarily in the Reagan, Clinton and George W. Bush administrations. Toxic those gambles went and both the Bush and the Obama administrations found themselves with no choice but to bail the banks out lest the whole economy come tumbling down.<br /><br />One of the results of deregulation has been the enormous increase in the wealth of the top one percent (yes, those people) and what has happened to the real income of most of the rest of us. Krugman has two charts on page 74 showing the growth in household income from 1947 to the present. While the rich have indeed gotten richer the average family has seen its income growth \\"slowed to a crawl.\\"<br /><br />But it's even worse than Krugman makes it appear. That's because the only reason middle income Americans have been able to tread water is because many of those families became two income families. In other words the head of household's real income has actually fallen.<br /><br />Another factor in the actual decline in the average worker's buying power and the amazing increase in CEO compensation comes about, Krugman suggests, because worker's unions have lost a lot of their power. \\"It's surely relevant here to note the sharp decline in unionization during the 1980s, which removed one major player that might have protested huge paychecks for executives.\\" (p. 82)<br /><br />One more point. Krugman argues that the harsh austerity measures currently being acted out in Greece and other places in Europe are not only mistaken but based on a kind of \\"morality play\\" mentality. We all understand how it feels when our neighbors get away with something like buying houses they can't afford. We don't want the government to bail them out. They were fiscally irresponsible and should have to pay the piper. However even if that is true it doesn't help us by administering punishment in the form taking place in Greece, Ireland, Spain, and elsewhere. Our standard of living will suffer if we place our desire to punish others ahead of our doing what is necessary to grow the economy. It would help a lot if somehow some of the mortgage indebtedness were to be forgiven, is what Krugman suggests.<br /><br />In short, there's a tremendous amount of economic wisdom in this book, so much so I would recommend it as a supplement to a college macroeconomics text. You'll find that a number of the sometimes difficult ideas in those texts are illuminated almost incidentally by Krugman as he explains how we got into this mess and how we can get out. I wish this were required reading for high school students and the members of the Congress of the United States.<br /><br />--Dennis Littrell, author of \\"The World Is Not as We Think It Is\\"rich have indeed gotten richer the average family has seen its income growth \\"slowed to a crawl.\\"<br /><br />But it's even worse than Krugman makes it appear.

B001NKI60W|5.0|From the beauty of the photography to the silliness of a bunch a men dancing down a dock in swimfins, this movie is very entertaining.  You simply feel good at the end of it because everything turns out for the better. I might not be an ABBA fan but I really got into the music, even when Mr. Bronson sang somewhat like I sound in a Karoke bar. And If you are as old as me you will get a huge laugh at the very end of the show when all the important cast is dressed well just watch it...
B007MDB6L0|5.0|My husband and I bought this for our 3 year old grand daughter.  She just loves fairies.  We decided to watch it (just the 3 of us) while we were babysitting her.  My husband got out his book and I got out my Kindle (so we adults would be entertained while the movie was on).  Well, just minutes into the movies all three of us were enchanted (and our books forgotten).  Our grand daughter was totally engaged with the story, the characters and the music.<br /><br />There were no scary bad guys, just a wonderful adventure.  We all got a bit teary eyed in parts and we all three cheered at the end.  When the movie was over my grand daughter looked at us and said, \\"Wasn't that a wonderful experience?\\"  Kids are so funny!  But yes, it was a wonderful experience.
0393088774|5.0|Whether one agrees with Krugman's neo-Keynesian approach or not (and I generally do although I know other camps such as the Austrians don't, and I too find some value in the Austrian ideas) Krugman is the most approachable writer on economics out there today for the non-specialist. He writes clearly and concisely and he has a way of making complex issues easy to understand.<br /><br />In this book Krugman gives his ideas on what caused the Great Recession and how to end it. One of the best parts of the book is on pages 62-64 where he debunks the claim that government \\"forced\\" banks to give loans to people who couldn't afford to pay them back. For one thing, the loans for commercial real estate and to real estate developers and speculators were greater than the loans to private individuals. And there were more loans to people living in the wealthier suburbs and exurbs than the poorer inner city residents. In fact, most of the loans being issued weren't even covered by the Community Reinvestment Act of the Clinton Administration. The history of science is filled with beautiful theories killed by nasty little facts and this is yet another one.<br /><br />But the book is far more than just that. The most important part of Krugman's discussion has to do with liquidity traps and how to deal with them. This is partly what his Nobel Prize was for, as well as international trade and the new economic geography. Krugman explains how the economy fell into a recession where people were willing to produce more than they spent, businesses were paying down debt rather than spending (resulting in the odd but self-defeating problem where their assets were declining even as they tried to pay them down, causing them to lose even more money) resulting in a shortage of demand. Krugman's response is for the government to offer bonds that people could then buy. This would give the excess savings that people were hoarding a useful place to go and that would act to stimulate the economy.<br /><br />Whether one agrees with him or not, the other schools appear to offer approaches based on older ideas that just don't seem to have worked in the past. At least this one is new and and who knows, maybe it would work.<br /><br />Of course, there are camps that argue that government stimulus programs are a bad idea and never work. Obviously, this is false if one looks at what happened to the countries affected by the Great Depression in the 1930s. Most countries didn't try a stimulus package approach because back then we didn't know what we do now. The U.S. tried a half-hearted one under Roosevelt which really didn't do much. (Although if one checks the economic figures the U.S. did have a modest recovery in 1937 as a result of projects like the Tennessee Valley Authority and so on). However, the Japanese implemented a much bigger one, and amazingly within a year the economy had not only recovered but was starting to overheat so much that the government had to discontinue the stimulus. But it worked.<br /><br />Of course, camps like the Austrians and others who don't like even the faintest hint of any government action to moderate the worst extremes of the business cycle will probably just counter the Japan example by saying the Japanese workers are just smarter, better educated, and harder working than American workers. What's a poor neo-Keynesian to do? LOL<br /><br />Finally, for those who don't like Krugman there's one very good reason to listen to him. In a study of the predictions of several dozen prominent economists Krugman was correct 13 out of 15 times. Most were no better than random chance or slightly better, and some were worse. Krugman's record was statistically significant at the .001 level of confidence for those of you who have some background in stats. But basically, that figure means that there was less than a one in a thousand chance of that result being because of sampling error or bias in the sample.<br /><br />Overall, this is a clear andwell written book on our current problem. Whether one agrees with Krugman's neo-Keynesian approach he's always worth reading for his ideas and his clear and cogent presentation of the relevant economic principles and facts.well written book on our current problem.

B001MYIXAW|5.0|The theatrical sub-titles make the film. While Amazon may be selling BDs with the correct sub-titles now, their other Prime vendors are not. I wasn't paying enough attention to the fulfillment line (only the fact that it was a Prime shipment) and as a result ended up with one of the crumby initial release BDs. The subtitles are so horrible it makes the film unwatchable. I just wanted to put this out so folks don't get bit by this like I did. Make sure you only choose Amazon for fulfillment.

B000FVE3A2|5.0|I own over 20 watches from G-Shock, Nixon, Fossil, Diesel, Citizen, etc., and I can honestly say this is easily one of my favorite if not THE favorite watch I own. I have been constantly searching for a watch that I could easily wear everyday at work but that could also double as a dressy watch.<br /><br />This is it.<br /><br />I have purchased quite a few watches online through Amazon and eBay but am usually let down by the appearance when it comes in the mail. The looks of a watch on the internet can be deceiving since some sites have very few detailed images and of course every person's wrist size is different. Happened with a Citizen watch I bought...ended up being way too small for my taste on my large wrist. I have always wanted an Invicta and stumbled across this style one day browsing through Amazon. I always thoroughly read the reviews and try to see photos of how it looks on people. I am not going to lie, I was kinda skeptical about ordering this watch because the photos do not do it justice.<br /><br />Let me just say, this watch is gorgeous. I have only had it four days but have already received numerous compliments. It does indeed have a larger face and is also heavier but compared to my Nixon 51-30, which is like wearing a kettlebell, it fits just right. Very striking in appearance it commands a look but doesn't scream LOOK AT ME, LOOK AT ME!! I took it to a jewelry/watch shop and had it sized to fit my wrist and it feels very comfortable. I love that it doesn't require a battery but works off of your movement or self-winding the crown.<br /><br />As I said, this is my first Invicta but it won't be my last. High quality materials, look and style. If you are looking for a nice in between watch this is definitely the one for you. Would definitely buy this over and over again. Also if you like the oversize face style but faces of a Diesel and Nixon are TOO big....then consider this.<br /><br />Well done Invicta, well done.

I started reading the first book & I still didn't understand what the buzz was about, until I got halfway through.  I contemplated stoping there, but then for some odd reason I was intrigued like many other women to find out what else was going to happen after it took a surprising & interesting turn.  To my surprise, I finished the 1st book in a couple days & was begging a coworker to borrow the 2nd book because I had to know what would happen next.  By then, I became obsessed with the books & eventually went out & bought the box set so I could read them again or loan them to a friend in the future.  If you are hesitant like I was, don't worry because you will fall victim to these books & to the seduction of Christian Grey.
B009IJJ712|5.0|The new show Elementary is all about the quirky genius who can solve a mystery but not get through a day without getting into trouble. Sound familiar? Yes, this quirky Sherlock (Johnny Lee Miller)can figure out elements of a crime scene faster than he can sneeze but can not do it without his personality getting in the way. He has an addiction helper named Watson( Lucy Liu) who was hired by Sherlock's rich father to make sure he does not dabble into his old habits.<br /><br />A friend of Sherlock's past is also the Lieutenant Detective for NYC (Aidan Quinn.) Its Sherlocks last chance to prove he can make a go of his new sober life by helping the Lieutenant. Fans of the show House MD should enjoy the complicated plots, the quick dialogue and the interesting characters of Elementary; but the quirky mannerisms and blunt observations by this Sherlock should prove highly entertaining for fans who miss House!
B0086700CM|4.0|this game is great I reccomend it to anybody out there who is competitive!! it is a challenging, yet astonishing game to have on a tablet, smart phone etc..
B0012DT9VK|4.0|My daughter is 5 and loves Tim Burton. This is visually fun, off-beat and entertaining. I certainly don't mind having it on in the background and love that it is visually more interesting than a lot of stuff out there.
B004VMVTNU|5.0|I love the gentle ramp up of the alarm (almost always catches me in the early stages) and the snooze is easy to use. Altogether better than the default you might find on your phone.
B008RV5K5E|2.0|Production quality of this film was so so and it didn't hold up at all to the classic graphic novel in any way. Warner Brothers dropped the ball when it came to this title and ruined it's legacy.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|Great game it has all the challenges that the original angry birds game has. Loved the freeing of the birds in the different situations. It was awesome to play.
0425263916|5.0|Quick review: this book (trilogy) is AWESOME_ buy it now- get the first book and read in order- make sure you have a full day or a weekend night because you will not be able to put this book down until you are finished-<br /><br />another cliffhanger ending?: yes. However, Sylvia Day is a master of cliffhangers where we still have our main \\"OH MY GOODNESS\\" of the book being wrapped up (so we are not literally in tears until the next one comes out- \\"Saving Grace\\" anyone? - if you read that book you know what I'm talking about-) However, there is still SO MUCH we want to learn and don't yet know about Gideon- and how will Eva and Gideon's story end? (and will it end??- please, no!)<br /><br />All returning characters from the first book- this book starts off the very next morning from where we went to sleep with Eva from book 1. and the story is FANTASTIC from page 1.<br /><br />I didn't find any boring parts- I didn't find myself skimming parts or even wanting to miss a single conversation.<br /><br />note of caution: there is ALOT of hot, passionate, no bared sex in this novel. This is an ADULT book. Not for kids or \\"young adults.\\"<br />However, that being said- the storyline and plot are thick- there is alot of substance to this book and storyline- and it's not just a cheap Haroloquin Romance quick flip though book.<br />This story is amazing. The characters are very real- very raw- distrubed- with complicated pasts and an even more complicated future-<br /><br />Buy it TODAY.<br /><br />Oh and PS to the publisher?  May 7th for book 3 ??? PLEASE reconsider- any sooner? work overtime even? (more then I'm sure you already do...)will pleading help?
B008MG1E4A|4.0|It was a quick read. It is a good book to help fill in some of the questions and a good source for truth vs. the hip from the media.
B000VZYPB4|5.0|Great TV show. Did not watch it on TV but a family member recommended it. Bought one episode and loved it!
B007EECSFA|5.0|I couldn't put this book down.  Kate Morton is a wonderful writer.  This book is the best of them all, and unusual story that I have never read in a plot before.  A new look at World War 11.
B005COO1X6|1.0|This was definitely not up to Stephen King's usual standards. The entire \\"book\\" was what normally would be the first chapter in a King novel. I was stunned when it ended, expecting to turn to the beginning of the second chapter.<br /><br />Not worth the money or time spent reading it.
B007SGM084|5.0|I loved the whole trilogy! I couldn't put it down! I will definitely be looking for more books like these.
B009KHDT0C|4.0|I love Johnny Depp so had to watch Dark Shadows.  Was somewhat disappointed in it, but then I grew up with the original Dark Shadows.  It did have it's funny parts.
B009GQ57ES|5.0|Simply the best.  Support a great independent artist who's well on his way to making his dream a reality.  Macklemore and Ryan Lewis are great in concert and their debut album does not disappoint.
B006225RN0|1.0|I enjoy the highlanders movies as well as the movies this DVD is terrible amazon had to exchange it 3 times and still would not work every copy had same problem last 20 minutes were unwatchable and pixelated
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|enjoyed very much. simply addictive. not much else I can say. try it now just to fun sake. this makes no sense having to write avreview with 20 wordminimum.
B009GEAPYW|5.0|Obviously they can't get as gritty as we would all like, but this is as good as it gets for a cartoon super hero flick. I read the book years ago and this is a great rendition of Frank Miller's work. I can't wait for part 2. Marvel may be dominating at the box office, but DC has found a home on straight to DVD surpassing all Marvel's lame attempts.
B007THA4FI|3.0|It was a decent book but It was real slow getting me into  it and then keeping my interest. First book I have read by this author and it was slow for me.Purchased from Amazon.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|outstanding book. I loved it so much i'm reading them all over again. I've actually ready all three and can't wait for #4.
B000NQDC1A|5.0|You may wish to check out my recent review on Renaissance Music by David Monroe for some of the  same biographical information regarding the The Early Music Consort of London (1963-76) under David Monroe. It is also an excellent CD to add to any Early Music collection.<br /><br />David Monroe was a major British music historian who started The Early Music Consort of London with  Christopher Hogwood. Monroe also published  a number scholarly works on Early Music. One of Monroe's early passions was the study of early musical instruments which he collected until this his death, and are now part of his historical archives. Monroe began a project to make recordings of musical instruments from the Medieval and Renaissance Periods during 1973-74. Monroe was himself was a respected musician in own right on the instruments of the period, and played many  of the included examples himself.<br /><br />After producing these recordings, Monroe started to compile a history based on his previous extended research.<br />The results of that research were a 90 page illustrated  volume entitled \\"Instruments of the Middle Ages and Renaissance (1976).  Some of these initial volumes were issued with  the accompanying musical recordings.<br /><br />The current 2 CD set consists of: CD1: Instruments of the MIddle Ages with 30  audio examples of Instruments of  Medieval musical instruments with period music. CD2  has 31 audio examples of Instruments of the Renaissance  playing Renaissance music. All examples were recorded by members of The Early Music Consort of London under David Monroe. Many of the actual example were recorded by, or with David Monroe.<br /><br />Some might consider this CD more of an academic exercise of some 61 short musical selections. To a certain extent this is accurate summation which memorializes the historical legacy of David Monroe. This is a rather unique and specialized reference tool for the musical instruments from the Medieval and Renaissance Periods. This isan important reference tool for those that may be interested in  Medieval and Renaissance music. This would not be much difference in learning those musical instruments of traditional Indian music for those interested in that music tradition, if such an example might exist?<br /><br />If you are new to Medieval and Renaissance music, I might recommend looking at my previous review, and check out some of the listed ensemble groups. You can also search for CD's from David Monroe,  Phillip Pickett, or Christopher Hogwood. If you get the \\"bug\\" and have a few CD's to your collection you might consider looking at  this 2 CD set, at some time.<br /><br />If you are already are collecting either Medieval, and or Renaissance CD's and do not have this CD, you might wish to consider adding the CD to your collection. As your collection increases you may desire to have a better understanding on the musical instruments used in this music for a more informed, and enjoyable musical experience. This is a unique CD that may not be always available in the furure, so you might consider giving this as a gift.<br /><br />I continue to enjoy this DC set since it was purchased.  This is an ADD recording of very goog quality, and you can hear the instruments as if there were playing in your living room.It is still a rather specialized item, but there few other CD's that provide this same  information.<br /><br />There is some wonderful Medieval and Renaissance music out there, we all should consider becoming more familiar with a large part of our unknown music tradition.<br /><br />BW
B0012TUPRQ|5.0|I have purchased a few products from the RAM product line and all of these items have worked flawlessly.  This double socket arm was used to make a GoPro camera mount for my wakeboarding, wakesurfing, and tubing sessions.<br /><br />The arm has a solid locking mechanism even though there is only one knob for tension.<br /><br />Great product.
B002MUAJ2A|5.0|Quick easy read full of solid real-world advice about how to quit participating in corporate sludge-tactics and get into a much more productive groove. There were several points during which \\"current state\\" corporate insanity was being portrayed in ways which literally made me laugh out loud.  In particular the bits about meetings and forecasts are not only hilarious but immediately followed by practical advice about how to avoid the traps.
B009GEBBNQ|4.0|Movie was entertaining. All in all, You have to know what you're getting. Not Oscar worthy but good.  I would recommend it.
B007FRHZ4A|1.0|We gave this to my 6 year old for his birthday.  He has the Angry Birds Knock on Wood game and loves it!  This version is a total joke.  The pieces are all warped with no flat edges.  It's impossible to build the towers shown on the cards.  Don't buy this!  Stick with the original Knock on Wood version.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|this is a great book that keeps you wanting more.  I'm not a big reader but this wrapped me in and i just couldn't stop. Felt like i could really relate to how Eva was feeling with her jealousy and love that she had for Gideon.  Cant wait for the next book.  Sylvia Day is a great writer and i can't wait to read more of her stuff.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|This is bringing back some great memories.  Love the concept.  Just wish my character didn't tire out so much.  Kinda like Sim City with hunting.
B003956Z98|5.0|First time I ever really got high off weed was the day I bought this album. By the time Siberian Breaks started up I was surfing a wave of sparks in outer space, and what's even better about this album is that it still sounds amazing when sober. I love OS and with this album, MGMT makes it apparent that they're going to make the music they enjoy listening to themselves. I love this band.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I'm not a reader of science fiction but my daughter made me watch the movie of the first book and then I read book 2 and 3. I became a fan it keeps you hooked right to the end waiting to see if Snow was gonna get his in the end. I can't wait for all 3 movies to be out as I will probably re-read all three books.
B002QKZLZ6|3.0|The case is made well and fits the voyager legend properly without risk of it falling out. However there could be so much more applications for it if there was a belt attachment at the back of it. Just a normal carrying pouch. And it comes in factory packaging
B008673ZAQ|2.0|First book Bare to You was excitement,fun,and romances all over that i couldn,t stop reading it.<br />\\"Reflected in You \\" was not interested at all, not until the last chapter. She was so into him,love him, even if he treated her like nothing? All the secrects he kept from her.<br /><br />They kept chasing each other back amd forth, i didn't get it, its borring.<br /><br />lets cross my finger for a better third book !
B0058SN2C2|5.0|Very cute, comfy and no one suspects they are crocs!  Buy a half to full size smaller than you normally wear--they run large.
B007J4T2G8|3.0|well written and good style.  content o.k. but a little old and marquis de sade.  a lot of repitition and retoric.  could have saved a few trees.  all in all decent reading and enjoyable at times.
B008D4AKYQ|5.0|I'm a big big fan of Big Big Train. The Difference Machine and Underyard Fall are very good albums that grabbed me immediately and each has held up well after a million listens.<br /><br />English Electric Part One, however, is in a league by itself. This record is truly a masterpiece and with it, BBT have reached new and impressive heights. I've listened to the album in its entirety several times and it just keeps getting better. My favorite songs are Summoned by Bells, The First Rebreather,  and Hedgerow, but every track is at least very good.<br /><br />Specifics? The songwriting is superlative. Recorded performances (especially Nick D'Virgilio's) are magnificent. And most important to my discerning ear, the production value is stellar. Vocal harmonies and drums in particular are well placed in the master mix.<br /><br />I'm not sure I can agree with the reviewer who compared this to Sgt. Peppers, but this is an epic, monumental album. It's progressive rock at its very finest, a supreme example of what's great about the genre.  I can't wait for Part Two -- I only hope it's a worthy successor. Five stars and highly recommended.
B00004SWBS|5.0|Great cd and some of Type O Negatives most memorable quality in one recording, whatever buy every TON recordade they're all great!

B001KDQ4KQ|5.0|The Pact was a riverting book.  Very well written, I love the way Jodi Pcoult gets you into her characters right away.  The further immersed you get the more you can't put it down.  I try to read anything she writes.
B008M721MS|2.0|this app wont show me, i can see whomever im talking with but it wont tap into my camera so its kinda useless. any help would be appreciated
B000FBFN1U|5.0|I bought Storm of Swords from Amazon for my kindle. I definately think it is the best of the song of ice and fire series so far, and they have all been beyond amazing! George RR Martin's work is of epic proportions. Only to be compared to that of LOTR. I will be getting hard copies as well!
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Now on to the third book .. cant wait to see what unfolds next .. im looking forward to an awesome read ..

B009NQKXYK|3.0|The movie was ok esp if you are a fan of the original alien movie/s.  Def has nice visuals and fassbender is great as the cyborg.
B00785P2QC|4.0|its a real pain to develop stuff but still pretty fun. It takes time to do stuff but its worth the wait
B004SBQALA|5.0|It has action, romance, comedy this movie was great to watch if u like sci fi movies or super hereo movies u will dig this. Number four is an alien who has super powers who parents died on his planet an had to be sent to earth with a protector.
B000FVE3A2|5.0|The 3044 pictured here actually comes with the Seiko made NH35A movement which is \\"hackable\\" Meaning that when you pull the crown out the seconds hand stops so you can set the time and synchronize with other clocks easier. It is also able to be wound manually by turning the crown. It has 24 jewels instead of the 21 that is stated. I talked to the supplier Discount Watch Store and their representative confirmed this with me. Just thought I would let everyone know so they know what a great deal this is! :)
B0063IH60K|5.0|Works great on my android. Very fast ----could do without having to skip ads every hand, but not a bad trade for a good game of solitaire.
B008K5T5AI|3.0|I have been a fan of Ian M Banks since the beginning, and especially a fan of the \\"Culture\\" novels. This one however seems to have been written by a close friend or relative. All the ingredients are there, but the quantities do not seem right, almost as though the trainee chef has cooked the meal rather than the master chef.<br />Normally Banks books would automatically get a five star from me but in this instance I cannot see more than three.<br />I will not spoil the story, but I strongly suggest this book should only be read by someone familiar with the \\"Culture\\" genre otherwise they will have difficulty in finishing the book.
B0018KSB5C|5.0|Watching the series with my daughter I realized I did not own the third part and quickly rushed to Amazon.  I found it for six something on blue ray! I was thrilled and the actual movie was pretty awesome too! :)
B0097EWK3A|3.0|I loved the game but there are a few glitches it did not download right at first I had to try 2 times. Also if you want to breeze through the game just hit the hint button. The other is my husband has a newer kindle than I do and it would not open the ending for him to finish the game.
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|Love the ups and downs in this book. this is as close to a real love story you can get. a great read.
B00005RDRO|5.0|this dvd met my expectations.  the plot is very very funny and the acting is supurb.  our house guests roared endlessly.  who says videos from the past cannot be entertaining?
0316017930|1.0|Malcolm Gladwell is a fraud. His books are pretentious and trivial. His writing is shallow and full of grand psychological, social, and economic generalizations. This con-man now charges $45,000 a lecture,so he can shamelessly self-promote the crap he writes,and himself.  If he wrote about Ron Popeil that seems to be an appropriate subject for a fellow con man in arms<br /><br />Gladwell seems to appeal to the self-help and self healers crowd. Stupid soccer moms and recent female college graduates who find his trivia in the following books \\"Blink\\", \\"The Tipping Point\\", and now the \\"Outliers\\" as extraordinary revelation. They are still underlining their copies of Ayn Rand's Atlas Shrugged and The Fountainhead.<br /><br />Barnum and Bailey were on target when they claimed there is a sucker born everyday. Gladwell has worked his snake oil into the bloodstream of desperate Americans looking for simple answers as to where their lives have gone wrong. This clown's musings are not the solution, but part of the problem. Gladwell capitalizes on his audience's banality, frustration, and anger, then walks away with millions, but they still feel stupid and also fleeced.<br /><br />In the 1970's and 1980's the major media pooh-pooh'd Alvin Toffler's \\"Future Shock\\"  and later, Charles Reich's \\"The Greening of America\\" .  These books were overall supported by facts and viable examples and not hypothetical situations without evidence. Gladwell is another example of how showmanship and entertainment have trumped legitimate scholarship and research over last 25 years.  ..... Get a haircut, you crook, the 60's have been over for 40 years.
B004FOA84A|2.0|Too short without any sense to the tasks or story line. just random clues that didn't make any sense. Fish in the bathtub,  bubblegum and secret stump......
0375703764|3.0|To give this book mere 3 out of 5 stars suggests that House of Leaves is a mediocre work. It isn't. But 3/5 is still the closest approximation of my feelings after reading it, no matter how inadequate the rating system is in expressing the book's flawed genius.<br /><br />House of Leaves has been marketed as a horror story, and a lesser author than Mr Danielewski would no doubt have turned it into a very engaging and still original piece of horror fiction. But the author has aimed higher, far higher.<br /><br />Just saying that House of Leaves works on many levels would be a rather trite observation; that much is obvious after even the most cursory glance. At the book's heart is a false document of sorts, which has been edited by one hand, then one more layer has been added by the character who, I guess, can be said to be the main narrator - and then there's one more layer of editors. Sound complicated? It is. For those who 'get' the book, all those layers probably are one of the hooks that draw them in, each level adding new meanings to decipher and discuss. I, on the other hand, was first confused, then irritated, and finally increasingly bored. At one level, it has been suggested, the book is a parody of post-modern textual criticism. If House of Leaves indeed is such an inside joke writ large, then I'm one of the outsiders.<br /><br />House of Leaves has attracted a considerable cult following. The sort of following who, for example, debate the true meaning of something that in a more ordinary book would have been dismissed as a typo. I can very well believe that Mr Danielewski has crafted the book to perfection, that every word, letter and space is just as it should be. But I wasn't fascinated enough to begin the quest of unravelling all the meanings encoded therein.<br /><br />House of Leaves will remain in my bookshelf. I have this uncanny feeling that one day I might try again - and be sucked in, becoming one with cult. More probably not, but I like to keepmy options open.
B007IXWKUK|4.0|The second book was very informative as it explained the reason for his Fifty Shades of Grey.  I enjoyed the first, second and last book and was sorry whenI finished. I wish there was more, alas, but I can re-read all.
0425263908|1.0|In all of her books it's the same thing; the same phrases, the same acts.  I've had to skip soooo many pages because it is all the same sex, words, etc.  the only interesting character was Cary.  I guess this is supposed to be erotic but it is dull.  Had no substance to it, left you hanging on Gideon's problem.  Every book uses the same sexual phrases, and it has too many sexual, ridiculous scenes.  I would never have wasted my money if I had known how the book was written.  I don't mind sex in a book, but this goes on to be beyond too much.  No substance whatsoever.
034580404X|5.0|I thought that this was a great buy for all 3 books. Have enjoyed them a lot. I hope whoever buys  this set will enjoy them to.
B001TODO54|5.0|Graceling is one of the books that I picked because of the ongoing and unending hype it gets on the blogosphere. I was really curious as to why my friends gave 5 deserving stars for it. And because of the 5-star ratings I'm seeing around lately my interest on the book rose up and I guess you know what happened next. I bought a copy of it despite the complains of my wallet.<br /><br />Graceling is a wonderfully woven tale that would keep the readers stay up all night.The plot and the concepts in the book are unique and very original.Especially the idea of the \\"gracelings\\" and their unnatural eyes.<br /><br />Gracelings are people who possess exceptional skills. And Katsa is one of them. Every graceling living in a Kingdom are subject to serve the King unless their Grace are considered useless. Katsa's grace was killing, or should I say surviving. She was mandated to serve her cruel and injustice Uncle Randa, who is the king of the Middluns. Due to her uncle's cruelty in treating the people that displeased him, Katsa created a Circle that fights for those people who are treated wrongly.<br /><br />Katsa's a great embodiment of a perfect heroine. She's independent, headstrong, has exceptional skills in fighting, witty.. you name it! She's one of the most strongest and likable characters that I have meet. Despite of her great exceptional skills she also has flaws, which makes her even more realistic. What I like about her is her naiveness.  Because of her Grace she forgets to live life normally and the idea of falling in love for someone is out of her mindset.  Needless to say, She's blind in seeing who love her. Anyway, It was a good feeling, on my side, to see the characters growing. Back then Katsa hasn't had the ability to control her grace yet. Whenever she gets angered she always gets the feeling to kill someone in a way. But throughout her journey with Po, Katsa's personality has changed drastically. And seeing her grow gradually brings smile to my face.<br /><br/>Po on the other hand is thoughtful, witty, perceptive and my book boyfriend, haha. Just like Kasta he's a graceling, so he also has his own Grace.<br />His personality was likable. Really likable. There was NO time, from the beginning till the end of the story, that I felt a small anger towards him. That's how strong his personality is. The way she looks at Katsa was fierce and full of admiration! Their chemistry when they are together was amazing! I love it! Although he seems so perfect to be real, he's my favorite character in the book. He's the kind of person you wanted to meet in real life.<br /><br />I was really upset about what happened to Po in the end. It was so sad and I nearly cried because of that! :( But one thing that came into my mind was the idea that everything we have has its purpose, you might not see it now but soon it will reveal it's reason of existence.<br /><br />The love interest in the book was obvious as to where it's leading.If you haven't read the book yet and you're worried about that you shouldn't cause that won't ruin the story. Trust me.The romance in the book was indeed a cute one! Po was Warning: There is a love scene in the book. And yes I'm spoiling a part of the story for those people who are easily offended by it.<br /><br />There were a lot of scenes in the book that made me laugh until my stomach hurts.The best part of the book that enlightened my day was the time when Katsa has eventually give in to her feelings and hugged Po. That scene was just so heart-warming and magical! :3 Not only that but the book has also channeled a negative energy that made me nervous and melancholy at the same time. Especially at the end of the book when I knew what happened to Po.<br /><br />The world-building is so wicked and fantastic! Especially, the idea of Gracelings and how they were used by Kings. The actions and adventure were<br />distributed evenly. I'm glad that there was not a time when the book is draggy.<br /><br />I didn't haveany issues about Graceling, except for the last part where the King was killed. I thought it was rushed and I was actually expecting more of an epic death for him! Haha. Oh, well I was satisfied anyway so it was a minor issue.
0316228532|4.0|I just got finished reading J.K. Rowling's The Casual Vacancy. I loved it. The development of each character throughout the book kept me coming back for more. It might have been a slow start, but once I really got into the core, it shocked me how much I was enjoying it. The last few pages left me sad, raw (because I might have connected with the characters more than I thought) and satisfied.
B007V2UGPE|4.0|great way to kill time,with lots of upgrades,  just wish it had a way to turn the sound off and on
B00913P6G0|3.0|Im a fan of Kendrick and section 80 to me sounds wayyyy better than this album.The beats,the lyrics , the concept was brilliant. Section 80 flowed much better . The media and people as a whole are to quick to throw the word \\"Classic\\" to quick.This album is good,but he can do better.To me, an example of near,or if not a classic that dropped this year is Nas Life is good. Im sure that is going to be a good topic to argue about.
B0052RDHTM|5.0|I love historical novels. Follet is the best! He can explain thoughts and feelings that take history and explain it in modern words.
B00280LYHS|3.0|I have overall as a whole enjoyed the Percy Jackson series. If i could i would give this Book about 3 and 1/2 stars i liked the fact that it was so action packed from the get go. However, all sowrd slashing did get repptive in my eyes. I do feel  the demi gods interactiong with their parents was a nice touch. I  personally enjoyed the back stories  for some characters.
B0092MKTL2|5.0|Fantastic album. Every song was different in some way and I actually listen to the whole thing, which is not usually something I do when I buy CDs. Highly recommended.
0449806847|5.0|Very educational on how our economy works.  It explains in simple fashion how the parts of the monetary system works and the limitations on the Federal Reserve's ability to change things with the tools that they have.

They explain how to quantify outcomes within the financial markets, professional sports or elections.<br /><br />This book is especially interesting because Nate Silver has honed firsthand his statistical skills onto numerous domains including professional poker, baseball performance forecasting (he developed one of the best software program to do that), political elections (his \\"fivethirtyeight\\" blog).  And, when he is not a firsthand practitioner he is a first class investigator.<br /><br />The first seven chapters cover the errors and successes people have had in forecasting in various disciplines.  Chapter eight is the most pedagogical, as the author explains the basics of Bayes Theorem that he considers as an overall solution to many of the errors we make in forecasting.  The last five chapters focus on Bayesian thinking within various disciplines.<br /><br />Nate Silver's coverage of the credit rating agencies \\"Catastrophic failure of prediction\\" (first chapter title) is excellent.  In a single sentence on page 13, he captures the cause of the financial crisis: \\"In advance of the financial crisis, the system was so highly leveraged that a single lax assumption in the credit rating agencies played a huge role in bringing down the whole global financial system.\\"  Silver states that the AAA rated CDOs were deemed to have a default rate of only 0.12%.  The actual default rate was 28% or over 200 times greater!  This was because the rating agencies missed out the correlation between mortgage default rates at different locations when a nationwide home price downturn hit (see figure 1.2 on page 28.  Watch out that he mislabeled column 3 and 4 from the right).  Silver assesses that overall leverage was too high during the housing bubble.  Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac had a debt-to-equity leverage of 70-to-1.  Lehman Brothers and other investment banks were leveraged over 30-to-1.  Borrowers had often loan-to-value ratios of 100% on their homes.  The volume of credit default swaps, MBS, CDOs represented 30 to 60 times the volume of home sales during the bubble years (fig. 1.5 page 35).  Nate Silver summarizes the errors made.  Investors trusted the rating agencies.  The rating agencies assumed home prices would never decline on a nationwide basis because they never had since the Great Depression.  Lenders and borrowers believed rising home prices would bail them out through refinancing.  Policymakers believed the financial system had enough capital and was self-disciplined.  And, economists completely missed the ensuing severe recession.<br /><br />Nate Silver focuses next on political predictions.  This field of experts was so bad at predicting it motivated him to enter it by starting his fivethirtyeight blog.  He documents their failings extensively.  Within this chapter he refers to the theory of Philip Tetlock, professor of psychology and political science at Berkeley.  Tetlock had surveyed predictions of experts in various fields.  And, he categorized them within two archetypes: the hedgehogs and the foxes.  The hedgehogs are dogmatic, rarely change their minds, and are very confident of their forecast.  The foxes are just the opposite.  They update their forecasts as often as new information warrants it.  As a result, they make better forecasts.<br /><br />The chapter on baseball is one of the best because of Silver's extensive firsthand experience.  He uncovers many concepts applicable to many sports such as  the age-curve of baseball performance (pg. 81).  All sports have a predetermined age-curve.  Actually, every single aspects of life including life itself have predetermined age-curves.  His description of what it takes to be a successful professional baseball player (pg. 97) has also surprisingly broad applications.  The conclusion of the chapter is also fascinating.  It describes baseball management as a competitive arms race of intelligence gathering to extract small competitive edges.  And, that those competitive edges are short-lived.  That's a very interesting application of the Efficient Market Hypothesis.<br /><br />The chapter on economists documents how inaccurate their forecasts are.  The majority can't forecast a recession that has already started as they missed out on the three most recent ones (1990, 2001, 2007).  In November 2007, the average economic forecast was 2.4% real GDP growth in 2008.  Instead, real GDP shrank by -3.3%.  Economists assigned only a 1-in-2000 chance of the economy shrinking that much.  Yet, home prices were already declining.  Foreclosures had picked up.  Bear Stearns had gone belly up six months ago.  Those were powerful signals the housing and financial markets were on the edge of a cliff.  Also, economists are way too confident.  The few times you can extract confidence intervals from the economic profession they are invariably way too narrow because they underestimate the error level within their forecasts (pg. 182).  Nate Silver states that: \\"this property of overconfident prediction has been observed also in medical research, political science, finance, and psychology\\" (pg. 183).  Despite our having so much more data and computer power at our hands, economic forecasting has not improved since 1968.  This is because our underlying understanding of cause and effects has not changed much since.<br /><br />Chapter 8 introduces Bayes's Theorem.  Here Nate Silver often refers to a very good book on the subject: [[ASIN:0300188226 The Theory That Would Not Die: How Bayes' Rule Cracked the Enigma Code, Hunted Down Russian Submarines, and Emerged Triumphant from Two Centuries of Controversy]] by Sharon Bertsch McGrayne.<br /><br />Chapter 9 and 10 about chess and poker are excellent.  Kasparov was ultimately beaten by a computer bug.  IBM Big Blue made a move late in the last game that did not make any sense (the team who programmed it confirmed it was due to a small programming bug).  Kasparov who was in a vulnerable position could not figure out that move and in despair resigned the game and lost the series.  The Pareto principle of prediction on page 312 and 314 and the ensuing economics of poker are really interesting.  Poker winning are heavily dependent on the one worst player at a table.  If he leaves, the winnings are a lot harder to reap.<br /><br />Chapter 11 on the Efficient Market Hypothesis (EMH) is excellent.  Nate Silver states that the stock market is efficient most of the time, although it is never perfectly efficient (that would preclude a market).  But, it can be wildly inefficient on few occasions associated with bubbles and crashes.  Nate Silver demonstrates how both technical analysis and fundamental analysis do not beat the market over the long run.  Fig 11.3 on page 340 shows no correlation between the performance of mutual funds over the 2002 to 2006 period vs over the 2007 to 2011 period.  Past performance is no guarantee of future returns.  Next, Silver refers to Robert Shiller in showing the market is not as efficient as the EMH entails.  Shiller looked at the P/E ratio of the S&P 500 over a trailing 10 year period and looked at prospective returns.  And, the longer the period contemplated the greater the negative correlation between trailing P/E levels and future average yearly returns.  This suggests that the market can get overvalued.  But, the return correction is not apparent until looking at average return over a 10 to 20 year period.  Next, Nate Silver refers to the works of Richard Thaler and Daniel Kahneman in behavioral economics to outline how market traders are not perfectly rational.  They suffer from herd mentality, overconfidence, and being overly emotional rendering their trading pro-cyclical.<br /><br />So, if the market is not so efficient, can you beat it?  Probably not.  On page 345, Nate Silver demonstrates how a hypothetical investor with perfect timing over a decade (1976-1986) would get killed by very small transaction costs.  Even though this investor would handily beat the stock market before transaction costs, he would wipe out most of his capital after transaction costs.  Silver next tests a prudent investment strategy over the 1970 to 2009 period.  He assumes an investor is prudent and sells his position in the S&P 500 index whenever it had declined 25% from its peak and reinvests whenever it recovered 90% of its value.  Such an investor would have earned only 2.6% per year vs close to 10% for a simple buy-and-hold strategy.  Nate Silver does believe several hedge funds can beat the market.  But, they have intellectual and technological resources that no retail investor and few mutual funds can match.<br /><br />Chapter 12 on climate change is really interesting.  He differentiates between where scientists agree and disagree.  They all agree that the greenhouse effect exists and keeps the Earth warmer than it would otherwise be; that temperatures have risen over the past century; that greenhouse gases have contributed to that trend; and that water vapor is by far the most potent greenhouse gas (not CO2 as the Media conveys).  The majority of scientists agree that rising CO2 concentration does contribute to rising temperature.  But, there is a debate regarding how much.  Where the scientific community is more divergent is regarding climate models and projections.  They acknowledge that Al Gore's [[ASIN:B000ICL3KG An Inconvenient Truth]] deterministic apocalyptic message was way off base.<br /><br />Nate Silver explains why there is much uncertainty regarding climate models' projections.  One uncertainty is figuring out CO2 levels 100 years down the road.  Another uncertainty is getting the causal relationships right (there is a lot more than CO2 at play).  Another uncertainty concerns whether those models are programmed correctly.  Within the vast quantities of computer codes, are there a few bugs that contribute to generating erroneous forecasts?  Nate Silver reviews the prediction of the IPCC's 1990 model and observes that temperatures have not risen as fast as the model predicted.  Current temperatures are below the model's 95% confidence interval.  This lead the IPCC to reduce their baseline temperature increase from 3 degree Celsius per century in 1990 to 1.8 degree in 1995.  On page 407, Silver comes up with an interesting application of Bayes theorem applied to rising temperature predictions.<br /><br />The last chapter on terrorism is intriguing.  Terrorist attacks follow a similar Power Law as earthquakes.  The frequency of events declines exponentially with increase in intensity.  More violent events are much rarer than lesser ones.  But, the few major events dominate the data in human casualties.  For instance, 9/11 represented more than half of the total fatalities from terror attacks in NATO countries since 1979.  Thus, it is worth exploring means of mitigating the impact of such events.Russian Submarines, and Emerged Triumphant from Two Centuries of Controversy]] by Sharon Bertsch McGrayne.<br /><br />Chapter 9 and 10 about chess and poker are excellent.

B009HV2JT8|1.0|This movie was so far off the book it was ridiculous. Sadly, this is the way Hollywood has started to go and it stinks. Buy up the rights to a books name then, under the guise of creativity, change the entire story. If I could rate this travesty 0 stars I would. A big negative for this guy.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|Follett's second novel of the Century Trilogy is a great read.  It's perfect for an E-Reader due it's bulk and weight.  Though it's 900+ pages, it's a fast read.
B0083SBJXS|5.0|I originally wasn't going to get the blueray, but the regular dvd didnt have the special features so I had no choice bt to go with the blueray. But very fast shipping otherwise thank you!
B008QTV3X0|4.0|I purchased this show based on all the praise it has gotten and I wasn't disappointed.  Very riveting and keeps you asking for more.  Overall a great show!
0006136656|5.0|Frankly I had never heard of \\"The murder of Roger Ackroyd\\" until a few weeks ago.  Given it is the most read book by the most read author of all times it deserves more fame.  I enjoyed it very much but given the large number of suspects and the complicated plot it is not a book to read when you are tired or distracted.  I was very surprised by the ending but, in hindsight, I should have been able to figure it out.
B003VANOFY|1.0|Bought one of these looking for a good wireless solution for gaming and Skype.<br /><br />Initially, I was very impressed. They sounded great. I raved to my friends.<br /><br />My friends on Skype mentioned how much better my old mic was, so I switched to the old mic, but that wasn't a big deal. My old microphone was a dedicated device, not wireless, of course it's going to sound better.<br /><br />I loved my G930 so much I bought a second one for work. I'm a video game designer, and am playing games and talking to teammates every day, both at home and at work.<br /><br />Then after only a few weeks, less than two months, my USB wireless connector started cutting out. About every 10 minutes. This happened to both headsets, on two different machines, running different VOIP software.<br /><br />Then the friends I talked into getting this headset started complaining about the same thing.<br /><br />At the same time, the Logitech Device Manager software stopped working reliably. It would often show no device connected, it would randomly reset my settings, so volumes would change randomly. It would be slow--several seconds--to respond to changes in the volume control.<br /><br />They are now unusable for more than about 10 minutes at a time. I have since doled out more money for an Astrogaming A50.<br /><br />I updated everything, uninstalled/reinstalled. As far as I can tell, it's just not perfected technology. Cannot recommend.
B0052CK5PQ|4.0|Fabulously written and made me laugh out loud and could also relate to a lot of the book! Thought  provoking
B004GCPJDQ|5.0|First off, I didn't jam the battery pack into the mouse, I looked it over carefully and decided how it should go in.  I placed it in carefully and pushed gently until I was certain I had it in the right way. I examined it one more time in the mouse to make sure it was in correctly before exerting pressure needed to snap it into place.  The first examination showed I had it in backwards.  Thanking God that I hadn't just jammed it in without looking, I took it out and turned it around and repeated examination.  Took three minutes.  After seating it correctly I used it a bit then set it on its charger to charge.  I've had the recharge pack for about five or six months and I haven't had one little bit of a problem with it.  I've left the mouse on 24 hrs a day for two or three days before recharging and still had power enough to do what I needed to do before putting it on the charger. I'm buying this charger for Christmas gifts for all my magic mouse user friends and family.  It is, by far, one of the best investments I've ever made in my computing experience and that would be so even if I had to set it on the charger every time I was done using the mouse.  But I don't.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I was out of sorts when I finished Fifty Shades of Gray, I was so concerned about the characters. I literally couldn't get the story out of my head. I absolutely had to go to my kindle and download the next book. I absolutely love this series and the characters. I love it even more that people hate it, and find fault with it. I can't really understand why people have to be hateful about it, but then again I usually don't understand hatefulness. This is a very enjoyable read. I am saving the final book so I have something to look forward to. I get very lost when I find moments to absorb these words. To me, that is a great book. I am not nit picking it apart. I'll save that for other uptighties.
B009CPEOC4|5.0|I loved the movie. It gave me more of an insight into who she is and where she came from. A must see for any Katy Perry fan!
0385535147|5.0|This is one of John Grishams best. This novel is about a 43 year old black man named Malcolm Bannister. He was an innocent man who got caught up in a scheme by a trickster in Washington (WOW WHAT A SHOCKER!) and got sentenced to 10 years in prison at what they call a prison camp.<br /><br />The story takes a twist when a Federal Judge by the name of Fawcett gets murdered along with his young secretary 5 years into Bannisters sentence. Apparantly he cant keep his pants on but that doesn't come as much of a shock from a goverment offical does it? Bannister uses the information he has to try to work his way out of prison and step into a new identity. Will it work? Bannister will come to learn that not everything is as simple as it seems.<br /><br />Bannister gets out of the federal prison camp but soon figures out life is not as simple as it once seemed. When he enters the witness protection program he has to design a new fabricated life. Life just got much more complicated. Until the murderer of Judge Fawcett is behind bars will Bannister be able to live without looking over his shoulder? Will his former family be harmed?<br /><br />This was an excellent book and runs at a quick pace. Slow down towards the ending though and catch the finer details. Its easy to skip over them and finsh up at the end confused. Overall this was a wonderful book by master author John Grisham and I dont except anything less from him. Dont miss this one!
B0054JZC6E|4.0|these games are really cool...easy to play. great for young teens up to adults. highly recommended for people of all ages!
B008673ZAQ|4.0|Even though this is very similar to the 50 Shades books, I like the characters and the psychological underpinnings much better.The writing itself is a bit more substantial. I'm sure the reason they're popular is for the same reason as the 50 Shades series,but I find both a bit tiresome for the very reason I believe they're popular.

0061537969|4.0|\\"This is what I would like. To play in those fields for a little longer. To spend a little more time being me before I become someone else.\\" -- Enzo, the dog<br /><br />The Art of Racing in the Rain, by Garth Stein, was presented to me as an easy, quick read. I agree, although I misinterpreted that as meaning light. To be honest, I'm surprised the conceit of the book that the narrator is a dog works so very well. I would not have expected the entwined theme of racing cars to work for me, either. Somehow, the book -- the narrator, Enzo -- overcame my resistance and disbelief and moved me to tears. This book is heavy, but a good read.
B0038AUY96|4.0|Probably not a wise read if you're going off on a winter holiday - you'll never look at a snowman in the same way again! Great start and keeps the momentum going but didnt really buy into the ending but dont let that stop you reading this. Also if you dont have nipples best not to read this. Lots of twists and turns and scarey moments - a definite page turner. Lets hope the movie does it justice.
B008GVD6D8|4.0|I was eagerly waiting for the release of this book & started reading it straight away. Was finished within a few short days. I liked the fact it explained in more details about Gideon and his past as the first book really didn't give him a proper background. However nothing much happened in this book. It was all about opening up details from their pasts. There were a few twists and turns that I didn't know was going to happen but when it did I wasn't surprised. It was still a good book if you liked/loved the first one. But I do hope the third book can offer a little bit more.

Unfortunately, there  was ZERO chemistry between the two of them.<br />Watch the Gwyneth Paltrow Emma-it is much better all around with better acting performances and chemistry between the two main characters.<br />Makes me appreciate BBC Pride and Prejudice even more when you see how these movies can miss the mark like this one did.
B007FEFLTO|1.0|...made the latest installment of the \\"Century Trilogy\\" from Ken Follett unreadable.  I abandoned it during the Spanish Civil War.  According to Follett's version of history, the last century was a struggle between the Fascists and the Socialists, when in fact, these are just different versions of statism, and have more in common than significant differences.<br />I subsequently learned that the major influence for this series is the lately deceased Eric Hobsbawm, a noted historian and Communist Party member.<br />I'm a big fan of Ken Follett, have read all his books, including Fall of Giants, which I enjoyed.  Very sorry to report that Ken has allowed his left wing bias to so distort the historical narrative.

B002ZB26AO|5.0|A bleak and sobering look at how self absorbed dictators can manipulate an entire population.  The regime in North Korea makes itself the deity of the people and uses fear, manipulation and ignorance to control its citizens.

B008XNZMOU|5.0|I just bought this today and I listened to it and I have to say I love it. I have a few of Taylor's songs  from her other Album's on my I pod. I think the songs are great. This Cd has something for everyone. I think it is a great mixture of country and pop. Taylor sings the kind of songs that get stuck in your head or you find yourself singing along at least I do. I bought this album  because of the song begin again. The first time I heard that song through I tunes that song was stuck in my head for days. Very glad I bought it.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|Anyone that doesn't know how to work this extremely easy and helpful alarm clock with their Kindle Fire doesn't belong trying to review a product they're incompentent of using. This app is on my smart phone and Kindle and I haven't ever been late to work!
0316228532|5.0|This book was very interesting and engaging... I finally had to just sit down and finish it so I could move on with my life!  Each of the characters was artfully written. I was fascinated by the fictional town and how everyone was interrelated. I was transported to Pagford each time I opened the book. Many of the characters were unlikeable but still interesting to watch. I'm really impressed by Rowling, her mixture of dark humor and social commentary makes for a compelling read. I can't wait to see what she does next.
B0099G6Q5E|5.0|Awesome music! Only gripe is that some of the songs are different than they were in the movie. For instance, \\"Right Round\\" is about twice as long on the disc as in the movie, and has female vocalists too, and they added background vocals to Beca's impromptu rendition of \\"No Diggity\\" while removing the opera singer from \\"Since U Been Gone\\". So I guess they traded in being completely true to the movie for sounding more polished. Maybe this is normal for soundtracks, I really don't buy many of them. Still a great album though!
B00338QENI|4.0|A very well written book which ponders the question of who really owns your body tissue after it is removed. It also traces the Lacks family and their coping with the fact that they did not know that their mother's cell were being used by researchers around the world.
B008IJTFYW|5.0|I love it. I'm in school so I'm very stressed out. this app looked stupid to me,  but a friend told me it worked. I tried it but it did not work. the next night I tied it again and it worked. the first night might not work for you but don't give up. it will work
B003UMW68Y|5.0|I was so excited to see this movie on blue ray.  I think that the claymation movies in particular are so creative, and it just blows my mind how artistic it appears.  I give this movie two thumbs way up.  Great music, great animation, great director.  Go Tim Burton!  Sometimes he kinda creeps me out (his movies that is) but usually he is right on the ball.
B005K17RU0|5.0|easy to use app works great on my kindle fire also have used this app in my nokia. e71 phone and no problems!
B0064TVQ5E|1.0|This game freezes a lot! I understand it was free but you still expect it to work.I would like it otherwise.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|These books were so freaking good I got book daze. Book daze = forgetting where you are while reading, then when you have to stop reading, you stare off into space and think about the book constantly until you can start reading again. Amazing. It's my pleasure to support this extremely talented indie author.
1423124111|5.0|This book contains a beautiful collection of Disney Attraction Posters.  It's HUGE, taking up much of my coffee table.  All the classics are included and several are full page and just gorgeous.  A nice history on poster creation is also included.
1594200823|5.0|This was a page-turner and an eye-opener within the first 100 pages. If you value your health at all, it is absolutely necessary to understand the impact that food has on your body and your environment.
B009WJWMNI|5.0|I love, love, love this show.  Such a nice change from the usual mostly meh kind of shows many of the networks are churning out like the mindless so called \\"reality\\" shows that I refuse to watch.  Way to go CW-this is a winner.
B006ZAZ31U|4.0|This book is very touching and inspirational. Wonderful story of overcoming ones demons to rise to the highest levels of their profession.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Pre-order the book and received it early morning the day expected. My coworkers and I have formed our own book club. We love it. Finished in three days, read 11 chapters in one night. I read till I was crossed eye. Can't wait for book three. I enjoyed better than 50 shades of grey.
B007C7UZIG|1.0|I am having difficulty loging into my account. It activates the steam guard and sends me the code, but when I go back to put in the code, it feasts the steam guard, replacing the code I have with a new one. This makes it impossible to log in. I agree with these people who say it is a good app, but I cant even enjoy it.If there is some way to fix this, please find a way to respond to me.
B0052YAKS6|4.0|All his singers sound great (I'm pretty sure it's Guetta's manipulations--esp. for Snoop Dogg)...these beats and samples are amazingly familiar and refreshing at the same time.  I'm already looking forward to his next album.
B009GEBBNQ|5.0|Non-stop action with a dash of laughter and a tad bit of sorrow, but all ends well. Thor and the big green guy hit it off, literally.  FeMan is his usual sarcastic self and Captain America is still lacking a sense of humor.
B008764ZQ4|5.0|If you remember hearing these songs during the 80's, you will love this soundtrack.  Many great memories, although the songs are obviously re-done for this project.  Great collection!
B0094BB4TW|1.0|I loved using Facebook on my original Kindle Fire, but not on my new Kindle Fire HD! The screen jumps around, sends you to screens and pictures you did not choose or doesn't allow you to utilize the touch screen at all! This FB app is a waste of time and so frustrating! HELP!!
B008220B0C|5.0|Obviously, if you're a Katy Perry fan, this is for you. If you simply like a few of her songs, this could be for you too. Ms. Perry has a great entertaining title for all to enjoy!
B00973DDN2|4.0|Very good....a little repetitive and derivative of their other albums.  I think I'll like it better as I listen to it more.
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|fun very addicting try to stop I dare you wish I got more coins faster still love it worth the download
B0086700CM|5.0|it is very fun and it never gets old because there is always a challenge. I think that everyone should get this game it is very fun
B009GEEMLY|3.0|I wanted entertainment and I was given entertainment. Even though Joss Whedon touched this flick with his shiny presence, I didn't expect to like it, much. I'm not a comic book fan.<br /><br />This assumption was wrong. I really enjoyed the entire thing!<br /><br />Yes, there are a few plot holes. Yes, there are a few bits that simply don't work (not giving spoilers). And yes, you really need to watch the companion films for this thing to make sense. But if you just sit back and let it flow you'll be carried away.<br /><br />One big apprehension was Mark Ruffalo's replacement as The Hulk. He works, makes the character better and more believable (if you can believe in big green angry men).<br /><br />Special effects? Well, if they'd sucked I'd have blamed Robert Downy Jr.'s salary. They did not suck!<br /><br />Writing? A whole lot of territory was remapped and filled here. Motivations were built well, personalities meshed and clashed. One-liners delivered flawlessly and some of the best scenes I've watched flashed past. There were many times where I damn near shed tears laughing. There are even two scenes that caught me so hard I had to pause the movie until my vision cleared...this hasn't happened since Pulp Fiction.<br /><br />Drop your pennies into the maw and enjoy yourself.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|This is a very addictive game, wish coins regenerated faster. I wait for my coins to keep playing I can't. afford to buy coins but I do love the game.
B004SBQGHS|3.0|I enjoy Angry Birds and like it when new options are available. This one is fun and easy enough for my grand daughter to get a few stars.
B005ZMTYBY|5.0|I bought this movie to be watched on our iPad by my 5 year old twins. They absolutely love this movie and have watched it every day sometimes twice a day since its purchase date!!
B009B2GT44|5.0|I have loved this show from the very beginning!!!  So witty!  Max and Caroline compliment each other so well!  I would recommend this show to anyone who needs a laugh!!!
0307730697|5.0|I have read much of the literature emanating from the conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan and, while there are several books and memoirs deserving of high praise, this one is transcendant.  This book is about so much more than SEAL training, operations, or even Seal Team Six (DEVGRU).  It's a deeply personal story of waywardness, loss, personal struggles, darkness, temptation, pain (all kinds), redemption, transformation, focus, discipline, setbacks, determination, courage, toughness, fatherhood, servanthood, comradeship, warrior ethics, devotion to wife, children, and to duty, love -- and ultimately sacrifice.  The sacrifice not only of Adam Brown, but of his family, the special operations community, and this country.  Eric Blehm has done an outstanding job telling Adam's story, which is riveting and, at times, utterly gut-wrenching.  Blehm is also to be congratulated for telling Adam's story without glossing over or downplaying the signficant role that Adam's faith in God played in his triumphs over darkness and the way he lived his life.<br /><br />If you are primarily looking for nuts-and-bolts special ops tactics and behind-the-scenes exposes, you might look elsewhere; but if you are looking an amazing story of an ordinary, often wayward, small town kid who, despite huge obstacles perservered to become an extraordinary American Warrior in the highest, most ultra-elite levels of the military, you need to read this book.  There's nothing quite like it.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I was captivated from the beginning of Book One. I could not put the books down. I was reading every chance I got. Highly recommend.
B0076DCT2G|5.0|Nelson DeMille is one of my favorite authors, and his books, like THE PANTHER, are the reason why.<br /><br />Others before me have summed up the plot (which is fantastic), so I'll comment on other things.<br /><br />Characterization is excellent and dialogue is fantastic.  In the PC world we live in, John Corey's politically incorrectness is refreshing.  Corey is so real, and the supporting characters are extremely well drawn.  What a treat to see John team up with Paul Brenner.<br /><br />The book is suspenseful with lots of twists and turns.  Although a real pageturner, as I neared the end, I kept forcing myself to stop because I didn't want the story to end.<br /><br />I love all Mr. DeMille's work, but THE PANTHER is now my favorite.  I already miss John Corey and can't wait for the next book.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|I liked reading this book. It was a page turner. I was so sad it had to end with this book.
B005DJGMQE|5.0|I really enjoyed this movie. With the new movie coming out in November about Lincoln, I wanted to watch this one. To be honest, I didn't know much about his assignation so I don't know how accurate it is but it was a very interesting movie. I enjoyed it from beginning to end.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I finally decided to give in and read it because of all the hype.  I honestly cant understand why its getting the amazing reviews it is.  The Hunger Games deserves all the hype it got, This deserves nothing of the sort.  \\"Mr. Grey\\" is a Jealous controlling #%$*& (I cant put a PG word in there so I will leave that to the people reading this review) I don't understand why people are out there thinking his is so dreamy. I personally would prefer not to have an emotional abuser even if he is rich & hot.  I guess I need to work more on being a gold digger in order to bring myself to read the rest of the series.<br />If you are on the fence about reading this book............PLEASE SAVE YOUR TIME AND MONEY!!!!!!
B0047XCI0Q|5.0|I just finished my 2nd read-through of this book, and I'm now even more excited for Stormlight book 2! Sanderson is an excellent storyteller, and his attention to detail is magnificent.<br /><br />If you're trying to decide if this book is worth reading, don't be discouraged by the few negative reviews, but you should have all the information: This book is VERY detailed. Sanderson loves to flesh out the story with seemingly insignificant details such as what characters are wearing and what the weather is like. Some find this tedious. I find that it draws me into the story even more. So, if you're the kind of person who likes to breeze through a book just to get to the end, this might not be your book. But if you like to immerse yourself in compelling stories and masterfully crafted fantasy worlds, then read this book!<br /><br />One final note: If you're reading a review of this book, you probably know this already, but just in case... This book is the first in a (yet to be written) 10 book series. Some have criticized it for not moving fast enough or \\"not really going anywhere.\\" This seems an unfair complaint if you realize that there is more to come. Much more! I view this book as a tantalizing entre into an epic story that has great potential. I'm waiting eagerly for book 2!
B009KHBDUU|5.0|Classic Movie by Tim. He is one of my fav Producers/Directors. Couldnt ask for anything more. did a great job.
B008673ZAQ|4.0|It was a good read. Though I'm not quite sure anyone can have this much sex. Gideon and Eva are a great couple with great chemistry. I just couldn't give it 5 stars. I think I was expecting more of Gideon.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|I have downloaded this app on every device I own - 2 smart phones, laptop and Kindle Fire.  I love having everything in sync.
0385344333|5.0|The book was as promised and I am very pleased with my purchase.  I collect all Jack Reacher's tales and was eager to read Child's latest.
B009CPJHY4|5.0|I love everything about this movie. I love the cast, I love the story, I love the scenery, and best of all, I love the wisdom!
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Not into pain, however, these were great reads.  It is unbelievabe how love can change a person, even an injured and wounded person.  I takes true strength and love to make any relationship work.  This woman was willing to sacrifise herself to help the man she loved evolve into the loving person she knew he could be.
0345803485|1.0|I found this awful book on the NEW BOOK shelf at my public library. The other 2 were also there. Wow, thought I, NO waiting list, lucky me. I finally finished it. It was a slog. I will not be checking out the rest of this series. There was not a single character, especially & including the main two (Ana & Christian), that I ever want to read about again. I wish I had read the reviews here before I wasted my time. My advice (if you feel you really want to read this nonsense)...borrow it...from the library or a friend...don't buy it. I think it will be everywhere in book donation bins, used book stores, garage sales because its just that BAD. It is cataloged under Adult Romance...yikes...it should be \\"Fantasy\\" if anything. The publisher should be ashamed. There seemed to be NO editing at all. Where was the editor's red pen one wonders??? I found myself wishing I had started to actually count the every other paragraph that ended w/either \\"oh my\\" or \\"jeez\\". What an annoying read & to think someone would want to make this into a movie! Beyond the pale. I thought it was like something a college freshman would have written \\"back in the day\\" for Penthouse, only worse, much, much worse. How did this get published? Surely there are well written, meaningful, even sexy books out there. This isn't one. I hope EVERYONE involved w/this is mortified & embarrassed. I wish I could tell the publisher AND the author how completely BAD this book is & what frauds they are. I hope this series finds its way into the trash heap where it belongs & this author (what were you thinking???) STOPS writing such crap. If I could give it NO STARS, I would. I wanted to throw it across the room in disgust. If it wasn't a library copy, I would have tossed it out. I can't think of even ONE thing that would make this book worth either recommending, buying or reading. Its a disgrace its gotten ANY notice at all. For \\"women\\", ugh, I don't think so.
B002VWNIDG|5.0|This movie was creepy when it first came out and is still creepy years later. If your into this kind of flick I highly recommend adding this to your collection of flicks.
B0071MQBX0|5.0|After seeing the play in 5 different cities, I was glad to see the 25th Anniversary Celebration put together as well as hoped and each time I watch it will remind me of each live performance seen.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I have never written a review before but decided to for this book. I read many different types of books but not usually as much in the sci-fi genre. I got this book because of the good reviews and the great price. This book was great!!! I thoroughly enjoyed all of the characters and went on to read the prequel Wool 6. I would say definitely read 1-5 before 6.
B001HM1PFO|4.0|This movie, for it's time, broke all the rules for what should be done in movies. People so enjoyed this alternative story line that it spawned the cult following that it enjoyed in the 1970s and even today. Have no preconceptions, just watch and ask yourself, \\"Have I seen anything quite like this before?\\"
0756405890|5.0|The name of the wind is in my opinion one of the best fantasy books out there. It is pehraps not the most action-packed or fast paced book, but never before have I read a book that affected so much. The book is full of inspiration. I'm aware that many reviewers out there didn't find the book as mind blowing. It all comes down to: can you somehow relate to the author, his way of thinking or the main protagonist. If u can, this book will blow your mind completely.<br />Pick this book if u:<br />- like emotionally rich books<br />- like Books that give room for reader deduction<br />- have a bad habit of \\"escapism\\" and want to forget your present while drowning into a realistic mindfull story world<br />- If you liked any of the following authors: \\"Sanderson, hobb, weeks or brett\\"<br />- Can relate to a main protagonist described as: \\"Intelligent, witty, arrogant, open for experience and a hunger for knowledge and understanding\\"<br /><br />Don't pick this book if u:<br />- Think philosophy and psychology is utterly boring.<br />- Prefer fast paced action before character \\"thinking\\" and emotions.<br />- Have a hard time concentrating for more than 20 pages.<br />- Don't like to percive the world or think from the \\"shoes of others\\".
B009FZZFME|3.0|Ummmmm..... I need surround sound to hear the zombies coming from behind me!!!!!! Dish has HD and 5.1 sound! Why is this in stereo ONLY?!!! Ladies and Gents! for our feature film tonight! STEREO SOUND! I mean come on, REALLY? What am I gonna watch it on? my laptop! IT'S THE WALKING DEAD IN HD!!! If that's all ya got then fine, but I was overnighted a ROKU with 5.1 audio just so I wouldn't miss this show and boom. Great picture but eghh so so sound, nothing that's gonna scare my wife into thinking a zombie just grabbed her! The show so far is FANTASTIC!
B00860YICC|5.0|The Legend of 1900 is a very different story than what we are used to seeing. It might even be original.  It is about a child born on a cruise ship in the early 1900's who is left abandoned.  He is raised by a ship employee and becomes a prodigal piano player.  Some of the cinematography is stunning.  My favorite part is when the ship goes through a storm and he starts playing his piano and unhooks the piano wheels so he can become mobile.  I really enjoyed this film and have no regrets about the purchase.  I am now sharing it with all of my friends.
B000002UY3|5.0|the band mazzy star has done it again!!  fantastic music, great sound!  we always play this for dinner parties in the background and everyone always wants to know who it is!
1476712042|5.0|From start to finished I was hooked. This is not the normal love story, but boy, did I love every bit of it. I am a little disappointed in the \\"sex scene\\" stuff. I don't think the author needed to be so graphic (I'm a church girl), but did that stop me from ready.. nope. One of the best books I have ever read! You want to hate Travis, but you can't help to love him and you are screaming for Abby to love him as well. It's a book you get lost in and I love it!!
B0076DCT2G|5.0|Best book from this author in awhile. Glad Paul Brenner is back. Hopefully author will do another Brenner stand alone.
B0060YIBLK|3.0|Interesting book.  Quick and easy read.  Like any other self-help book, you must practice the suggestions in the book in order to get anything out of it.  Don't buy it if you're looking for easy answers and a quick fix.
B004JHYRP4|5.0|It's been a number of years since I read this book, but I still recall the basics of the story and how much I enjoyed the book.  The fact that he basically began writing this book off of a bet with a fellow author adds to it's mistique.  I don't have much to add here other than I don't understand how people can leave zero-star or one-star reviews for a book they didn't even finish reading.
B00003CXA6|5.0|This is an epic war movie. I am in no way a history buff however, Gettysburg is a tremendous movie. Great characters, action sequences and scenery. Must have in my opinion!
B009IKPOUO|5.0|This album contains all of Ms. Streisand's strengths, and showcases them beautifully! Her singing voice remains the gold standard for both pop and Broadway singers, in my humble opinion.<br />I will always be a fan of Ms. Streisand's singing.
B005LAJ1O0|5.0|I had already seen most of the episodes on TV, but I wanted the entire season and to be able to share it with my sisters on our annual trip. We all loved it!! (I knew we would!!) We felt like we were addicted to it! :) It became a marathon because we couldn't stop watching it!! GREAT SHOW!!
B004GYY714|5.0|Great link to all kinds of music.  No jazz station where I live, so it's<br />great I can get the San Francisco stations
B006JDFLR4|5.0|Its an amazing and inspiring book that will help you gain what you want out of life, I love this book
B008RV5K5E|5.0|This is the first DC title in a long time that didn't have lazy artwork and a boring storyline to it. Glad to see the real Dark Knight being done instead of the overlong theatrical ones by Christopher Nolan. This is the Dark Knight as was originally intended by Frank Miller, a great story brought to life by Bob Goodman, this is how DC should judge all their future products, if it isn't up to the Dark Knight Returns level leave it on the shelf. The only bad thing is we have to wait until winter 2013 to see the second part.
0316228532|1.0|I couldn't get into the story because of all the bad language and crudeness in just the first chapter.  It's so disappointing when authors feel they need to make books for adults R-rated.  I don't recommend it at all.
B008MEM24S|5.0|Love this game!  I have to say this and where's my water are the best games on Android Google play
B000CCIVDO|5.0|I got these a day before expected - this sort of thing always makes me very happy. But I must say, they sound very, very good. I love the head band - intelligent design. The little foam padding on the top is the same material padding for the ear cups, which I'm sure will last as long as every head set manufactured? But at least, I got me a great sounding pair of cans for less than the ever so famous Sony MDR-7605. Sony also, like so many other great manufacturers, include an \\"Achilles Heal\\" in their products. The Foam Padding in the ear cup plays a great part of the overall quality of sound. If this was made with more thought in better materials to withstand sweat, heat, weather, temperature change, etc., then I think these cans [HPS5000 & MDR-7506] would be the only 2 cans anyone would ever rely on!? The [HPS] is lighter in weight. Tighter in the head band. The [MDR] is heavy and slides off easily when turning your head too quickly. But to be completly honest, I will buy yet another pair of the MDR's and compare the 2, and give you a full report. For now I'm a happy camper.<br />Happy Headphone Hunting!
0446580848|3.0|John Corey is an engaging character and generally I enjoy his irreverant banter but this one was too much.  The story was a little thin and the end leaves me wondering about the integrity and morales of the John Corey character.  The end could have easily taken a better turn....maybe on the return of the prisoner to the US he could have escaped.  This would have given the author yet another thriller to create!
B004JZBGWI|5.0|This is a GREAT organizational app! I use it for shopping lists, to do lists, appointments, birthdays, journaling, etc. I like the ability to color code my notes too. I don't want to be without it!
B008XG1X18|5.0|I love Pinterest and this app makes it easy for me to indulge :) Definitely think people should get it!
B003O86FMW|5.0|this book was a great read! just as the first book was.  most anticipating the read of the last book.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|at first seems kinds boring. but once u start trying to collect all the prizes it becomes a challenge. fun fun fun.
B007KQI1NA|5.0|Bought this for use with Laptop and Tablet using Microsoft Streets and Trips 2013. Easy install. Just connect to Windows 7 Laptop. Then, Windows 7 searches internet and finds driver automatically (assume Windows 8 does the same) -- do not need/use disk that comes with GPS Receiver. Didn't need instructions. Microsoft Streets and Trips found it easily with a couple clicks in the appropriate GPS check boxes.<br /><br />Outside took five minutes to connect first time. After that, mere seconds. Very accurate latitude, longitude, altitude, mph, and direction.<br /><br />Better yet, after use outside, took it inside on first floor of my heavily constructed 2 story house it connected to satellites in seconds and gave usefully accurate position.<br /><br />For fun, the next day, I tried it with my desktop PC running Microsoft Streets and Trips 2004 indoors. Took 10 minutes to find satellites -- but connect it did. Gave accurate latitude and longitude. After several minutes of operation, it had zeroed in on accurate latitude, longitude, altitude. Readings do drift as new satellites come into the picture (as expected). Amazing it works so well indoors -- means it should often (maybe not every time) work in other \\"obscured\\" settings -- like big-city streets, forests, some interiors.
B001J9EHSC|5.0|great talent, great 1st album, just saw her in concert, one of the best artists out there. Her first album would be great if a 30 yr old did it, she was 17-18!
B007SGLZP8|5.0|Of course it's fiction!  Such a great storyline and a bit of a departure from what i consider his bread and butter books.  Hard to give a great review without spoilers, so I will just say that Grisham rarely disappoints and I can see this becoming a blockbuster at the Box Office too.
B002ZG976U|5.0|Christina and Cher did a great job, the singing was great, the women were ultra hot and sexy the dancing was great. good direction
B005GFPZYK|5.0|Very honest, well written story. No heroics, just doing his job. It was by a sniper who was very good at what he did, wasn't boasting, told it as it was.
B00846REIS|4.0|I was recommended this book because it was \\"like\\" 50 Shades of Grey - it is similar but a bit darker and not quite the 'love story' 50 Shades is.  I have read the first two and am waiting for the 3rd to come out.  I am eager to see how the author ends this series.
B00003CXSP|5.0|This movie was my least favorite of the series including Manhunter, lol. Remember the old made for tv movie. Actually i wanted to unreview this movie but the computer wont let me. Ha ha ha...has anyone ever noticed when you give a movie One star u get a lot of negative response. I think people agree with you that movie or cd was bad, by voting no against the reviewer. Its like saying, yes u are right the this film is bad. So they mark the No box, lol. Anyways thats all i got.
B007UQRW62|5.0|We were very pleased with our purchase.  The bonus material of the lobby cards and the umbrella with the charm was wonderful.  The quality of the movie on the DVD was excellent. We really enjoyed getting to watch one of our all time favorite movies without any commercial interruptions.  I would recommend this movie to anyone who likes musicals and is a fan of Donald O'Connor, Gene Kelly and Debbie Reynolds.
B009NQKPUW|3.0|This movie is disappointing in a number of ways. First, the effects are mostly computer-generated, and thus hard to get excited over. This is 2012; we've seen all this before. Nothing looks particularly real, and the actors always have to try to respond to thrilling things that we know just aren't there. In a lot of places, it could just be another cut scene from the latest highly-promoted video-game release.  Then the characters talk unrealistically and act unbelievably, particularly in the intitial setup scenes -- which I found just plain boring. Once the overall plot of the movie is finally revealed, there really is no reason to keep watching this film.<br /><br />  Prometheus could have made the Alien franchise scary again for a new generation (particularly because Scott was directing it). Instead, it's just your standard sub-par sci-fi movie. Sorry.<br /><br />  On the plus side (and there aren't many points to be made here), it can at least be taken as the first serious effort to reinvigorate the series since Alien 3. It's not comical. It just fails. Also it has a very good cast, particularly the actor who portrays the android (but why must there be one in every film? tradition?)<br /><br />  I was disappointed that Prometheus did not even manage to synch up storywise with the first Alien film. If you remember, in that movie Ripley's ship responded to a distress call and found a crashed alien ship on an inhospital planet. Ultimately they found a kind of \\"bridge\\" on this ship and the pilot dead in his chair, with his ribs broken outward. But in this film, though the ship still crashes, the pilot dies nowhere near his alien spacecraft. And what causes all these transformative phases of the Alien species, from octopus-like thing to retro-alien laying eggs to scitterers to chest-bursters to final Alien from 1979 film? It doesn't add up. What added up originally was an alien species that had evolved for eons on some distant planet into producing perfect killing machines ...<br /><br />The last complaint I have about this film is that it ruins the fear factor of the Alien species itself. The Alien from 1979 was as frightening as it was because it was so completely alien to a human being -- it frightened in the same way insects frighten, on an instinctual level. But once you say (as this movie does) that human-like creatures created both men and Aliens, you link the two as brothers of a sort and thus lower that fear factor immeasurably, albeit unintentionally. And to those who respond that it is MORE frightening because it is somewhat related to man, I offer my humble opinion that an instinctual fear (say of the dark) is far more powerful than, say, a fear based on evidence obtained by science (like that the Bible if rife with inaccuracies, if not downright impossibilities).
B0058YPL66|5.0|The series is fantastic. Having the set to watch again is great and to be able to share with someone who has never seen it.  Grand-daughter wants it!!
B007JNR518|4.0|This is a great movie for horse lovers, also for those who appreciate lovely scenery and certainly for Robert Redford fans - - - have never seen him do a bad job - - all the actors were very good. Well worth watching several times.
B008YZXYY2|5.0|Updated Oct 23 2014 -   This is the work of a true ARTIST!  This is my favorite album of Corey's career. The lyrics are amazing. This album isn't just needless aggression and yelling, it has real emotion and power.     This is the best album from corey in my opinion! I love that it's a concept album, the story in this cd is driven by coreys emotion he so easily pushes through his vocals for us all to feel. Listening to the lyrics the story unfolds and leaves me waiting for part 2 very eagerly! Stone sour has evolved to become something better than the original. As other music choices keep to the same tired format or a new format that doesn't have any staying power, let me say this album will be appealing for years.     \\"This record is an unseen enemy of the human mind.\\"
B003TSEEDY|5.0|A book about finding and liking as well as loving oneself.  A timeless theme, which will never grow old (pun intended).

0142501123|5.0|Grand kids just love this book! Easy to read and very entertaining. Kids can visualize and just enough 'excitement' to talk talk them through. I had to send each of the boys their own copies for home!
B007FG9LIE|4.0|When editors say a story needs to immediately grab the reader and keep them entranced through to the very last page, they ought to finish with \\"just like Blake Crouch's \\"Pines.\\"\\" I have never been so glued to the page, breathlessly swept through the increasingly bizarre mysteries of Wayward Pines, the secluded Idaho town into which Blake breaths such remarkable life.<br /><br />I picked this book up because the description reminded me of the premise of one of my favorite story-driven video games, \\"Alan Wake.\\" I was not disappointed. While Alan Wake is fundamentally a fantasy thriller, Pines is firmly in the realm of science fiction. I read some of the Amazon.com reviews prior to purchasing and was glad I had some warning that the ending twist is jarring. It is jarring enough that it lessened my overall enjoyment of the book, enough to move this from a 5-star review to a solid 4, but overall the book was an absolute blast, even if the twist ending didn't quite feel right to me for this story.<br /><br />If you're looking for an exciting page-turner that keeps you wondering \\"what in the WORLD is going on here?\\" Pines will not disappoint. I look forward to trying out more of Blake Crouch's fiction.
B0014JKJHK|5.0|Great shoe to use if you work in the service industry. Comfortable and EASY TO CLEAN! The only complaint I could have is that, as a rubber shoe, it isn't very breathable. I chose this style instead of the ventilated ones because I work in a kitchen, and the potential for something not-so-nice to spill into the holes wouldn't be worth having a nicely ventilated shoe. Even so, all it takes is slipping them off for a minute to let your feet cool off and it's back to work!! Traction is fantastic with this shoe, and I highly recommend it for anybody working in the service industry, both in the Kitchen, and front of the house work.
B008WCP2PG|3.0|`Girls, they want to have fun!' - and if that was the raison d'être for bringing this shallow film to the public it certainly paid off - the `Magic' was in the box office cash registers.  When the film plays on a DVD or Video on demand and is reduced to a small screen, then the fact that this is a very minor work becomes very apparent. One wonders why Stephen Soderbergh who brought us such fine films as Traffic, Erin Brockovich, Che, Kafka, King of the Hill and the Ocean's 11, 12 and 13 bothered with this. The script is by Reid Carolin who opted for more dance sequences and partying than significant storyline. The characters are very one-dimensional and the development of change is at a minimum.<br /><br />Mike (Channing Tatum) is a unique furniture designer who is saving his money to start his own business - the money comes from roofing, detailing cars, and stripping in a girl club and at parties. He takes a younger performer Adam called The Kid (Alex Pettyfer) under his wing and schools him in the arts of partying, picking up women, and making easy money, much to the disgust and frustration of dam's sister Brooke (Cody Horn). Mike brings Adam to meet Dallas (Matthew McConaughey) who hires men with the right bodies and equipment to show it all to the hungry women in the nightclub. His crew includes a group of male strippers - Joe Manganiello, Matt Bomer, Adam Rodriguez, Kevin Nash and others, none of whom has more than a line or two in between the dance numbers. Adam makes money and gets women, Mike gets women and occasionally gets serious (Olivia Munn) but after three months of stripping and partying Adam falls into the drug game with Tobias (Gabriel Iglesias) and that is the beginning of the end.  The rest of the film remains predictable.<br /><br />The acting is minimal, the dance numbers are what draws the viewers and if you judge films by the box office then this is a hit.  Pretty sad and trivial, but that is not the point.  The point, it seems, is to see guys get naked.  Grady Harp, October 12s get naked.  Grady Harp, October 12

B007THA4FI|1.0|I tried over a period of several weeks to read the book.  It did not grab my interest in the least.  Many characters and after reading 20 percent of the book, I still could not figure out the main character.  None of the characters were likable.  I returned it for a refund.
B007CRTNWK|5.0|I needed this book for school and got it in time for the project and it was a low price for a book that seemed new. Book is perfect!
0393343405|5.0|This extraordinary work was recommended by a Swedish author, at a TV program, BABEL, and I have read it, although being  Norwegian, in English,  with the greatest interest.  I studied English literature whilst living in England ( 15 years in all)  and have always found this language to be so much more rewarding than most Scandinavian languages, and reading this book shed light on the enormous variety within this , what I would call, the \\" Lingua Franco \\" of our times.  Stephen Greenblatt  has atributed to the  \\" canon\\" of  world literature  in telling  our times  of the enormous task it used to be to produce one single  work of handwritten letters,  and the search for this  particular item among  thousands  of ancient works, is thrilling and  hugely entertaining.  I recommend everyone who has any interest at all in the  heritage of written works of great art, left us  through  thousands of years, to read this  book, and then print out the actual text of \\" On the Nature of Things\\" by Lucretius,(ca 50 BC) to enjoy  the work 100 %. It will add a treasure to your library !<br />Ingrid Birkeland
B000068QKT|5.0|I love love love this movie! I saw it first on Hulu and immediately fell in love with it!It is a sweet story and I play it quite often to boost my mood.And did I mentioned it is French spoken with English subtitles? Sometimes I play it just to hear that beautiful language. All together I am very happy with my purchase,it was delivered within a time frame that I was given by the seller and in a perfect condition!I have already purchased quite a few items from this seller and have been always satisfied with the condition and speedy delivery of all of the items. I highly recommend this seller and will be making more purchases in the future.
B009KHDT0C|5.0|depp makes movies good but was outstanding, my wife who dose not like this type of movie had me pause the movie when she left the room. 2 THUMBS UP !!!!!
B009GEBBNQ|4.0|Very well done!  I had my doubts as to how they would pull it off, and not have this be juvenile, but Wow what a ride!!!  A little on the violent for a mom aith a ten year old daughter, but we reminded each other that this was an adventure.  It was a seriously rolicking good time.  Almost makes you want to be there, except I'm a big chicken.  Don't know how much I would have seen from under my nice safe rock.  Still we enjoyed it.  What's next?

B00992CF6W|4.0|As much as I love Minecraft, and I was overjoyed it came out on the kindle, there are minor glitches. Well on survival it would not let me collect the blocks I destroyed. And there is some lag time here and there. Overall they should have at least lowered the price a bit
B0085Y4JF0|4.0|it is a good chest rig depending what do you want it for, i would prefer that the pistol magazine pouches were detachable but thats ok, the color is very nice(coyote tan), and the chest rig is very useful if you practice shooting in the open, that way you dont put your magazines in the ground you have six large magazine pouches that fit 30rd ar magazines and on the sides have one internal magazine on each side also have six pistol magazines pouches and still there are some space for molle attachements. im still getting use to it is a little stiff but maybe i need to use it more to get it more flexibe, overall im using it for recreational purposes and so far no problems with it.
B000JMKO0A|5.0|Excellent book that any man should read...<br />Paul<br />Coelho's talent proves itself once more. He is easy to read and understand and deep truths could be find in many passages.<br />It is an 11 star book!
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|the third book in the hunger games trilogy is a nice read. It gets a bit depressing in the begining but its riveting and you want loose interest.
B008NEMPTO|5.0|Excellent. When the book swept me off my feet with its gripping tale of alternate history and \\"is it real?\\" fiction, I had high hopes for the movie.<br /><br />I did not get the chance to see it in theaters, regrettably. Needless to say, I was eagerly anticipating it to be released on video, especially since I have a 3D HDTV. As with all 3D movies, I'm always skeptical if the 3D will be believable or just a cheap \\"add-on.\\" Also, I'm always weary of purchasing a movie without watching it first, for fear of disappointment. So, I was going out on a wide limb to buy this one.<br /><br />Being only a fan of the book, I set the bar very high, and the producers took that bar and slammed it through the ceiling with style. Was it \\"exactly\\" like the book? No. Was that disappointing? No. Frankly, I was not sure how the makers would be able to fit all of the content into a movie that was shy of the 120 minute mark.<br /><br />The result was an outstanding success. The reviews of this movie are up and down, for both fans of the book and non-readers alike. This made me uneasy to \\"waste my time\\" with it. Bottom line, be your own critic. If you read the book, and loved it as I did, you are doing yourself a disservice by not watching the movie adaptation.<br /><br />The actors were excellent. The plot was true to the book. The locales and costumes were superb. The action was spot-on. The visual effects were just right. The 3D was amazing: the movie is meant to be enjoyed in 3D. Dust particles float before your eyes. Splinters fly past the screen. Depth adds so much to the scenery and backdrops. The story is great. The use of 3D splendid. Do yourself a favor and at least rent this one. You will not be disappointed.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I would definately read this book.  I wasn't sure what to expect.  I read it because everyone else was and really enjoyed it.  Great story!!!
B008XX6J4C|5.0|I'm a Rock & Roll guy............but this is the best<br /> \\"Chill Out\\" album out right now. The Piano Guys are more than a YouTube sensation, they are a new  Genre of music.

B008XNZMOU|5.0|Often new music CDs, Albums, Records, etc., curiously take a while to get used to, one having to listen repeatedly, randomly to develop, and/or acquire a liking to what you're hearing. Not so---at leat for me---with this release of  \\"RED\\" by Ms. Taylor Swift.<br /><br />Melodic, opulent, friendly, story filled and overflowing with music instruments, it is refreshing, airy, and ebullient, in keeping with her own personal style; reaching across [so called] genres!<br /><br />Hopefully, it will be a well received success...  ---GBJ
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Loved it! Even better than the 50 shades series. I just don't want this series to end. you're sure to enjoy this one, but make sure you read book 1 1st.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I loved this book from beginning to end. I could not put this book down. I also read fifty shades of gray and fifty shades freed and they all leave you wanting more. I was very say when the books ended cause I wanted more!!!
B008YZXYY2|1.0|Remember when you had your first playstation and there was this obscure game you would never put on? It would just lie in it's jewel box cause you got it free with the purchase of a first person shooter? But you never played that game more than once or twice. So imagine popping that disc into your video game console and then listening to it's soundtrack as you hit the menu button. Loud guitars and an irritating but persistent voice.<br /><br />It's title, House of Gold & Bones made me curious as to what the album would be about. The album is about as directionless as the title is. Its like the whole band got really high and decided to make a quick album without thinking too much so yelled and decided to record the first version of the songs they came up with but after the hangover is settled, they will truly realize how bad this album is.<br /><br />Why is the album so rushed? It's like the band is too scared to make sense. Even the acoustic songs sound rushed and it's although the vocalist doesn't want to pose so he doesn't sing with the same irony and whip of heart as he used to sing earlier for songs like say \\"Bother\\"<br />I don't think there is anything wrong with trying to stick to the same as long as you know what you're doing. A Perfect Circle came out with an album called eMotive a few years back and even though Maynard changed his vocal tempo in that album, he remained more or less, listenable and exciting. I fear Taylor doesn't have that geniality of mind to envision what direction to take.<br /><br />Most songs are grindcore. They sound like Soulfly, Slayer, a bit like Slipknot thanks to his dominating voice - but overall the album sounds like the band trying to get rid of the hangover with a keen spirited effort. Quite awful from the get-go.<br />\\"Taciturn\\" is an acoustic while in \\"Tired\\" Corey declares, \\"I just want to watch the whole world burn.\\"<br /><br />Influence of a drowsy God is cheesy aimless yelling.<br /><br />The Travelers Part 2 - is another terrible song and the last forty seconds are filled by the band repeating the lyrics using some sort of strange echo effects. NOT EXCUSABLE.<br /><br />LAST OF THE REAL - is easily the best song on the album. It has some well directed energy and aggression. Overall, just one good track in ten, makes this a very poor effort.r terrible song and the last forty seconds are filled by the band repeating the lyrics using some sort of strange echo effects.

B0063GORYU|4.0|this is a great game to play when you just want something to do or you just want to pass time.
B009IKPOUO|4.0|Although I can understand why these were cuts that weren't included on other albums, it's still great to hear some of the numbers. I could have done without the background studio chat before a couple of the songs ... but, hey, Barbra singing a song from 'Hallelujah Baby'. Nothing to complain about.
B0053O89KG|5.0|I love this TV series because it's witty and original, and since that's been better said by other reviewers I won't add anything about it here.  However, I will say that this collected episodes come in five dvds, all of them with bonus features, and that there are three commentaries for three episodes (\\"Rise,\\" \\"Cuffed\\" and \\"The Blue Butterfly\\").  That's an improvement!  Also, among the bonus features there's a segment about a show performed live and in the style of radio serial dramas in which both Nathan Fillion and Molly Quinn participate...and it's quite enjoyable!  Sound, image, close-captioning are quite good (mind you, I've watched these episodes only in my Mac laptop) and it's a purchase that \\"Castle\\" fans must do.
B0064X7FVE|4.0|The biggest complaint I have about this is that it is difficult to get the weather to update. This is why I ultimately switched to AccuWeather's app. Both are excellent to have, but AccuWeather's app updates when you need it to and TWC's...well, doesn't do it as easily.
B009IKPOUO|4.0|As always, Barbra Streisand's voice is incredible. Personally, I could do without the talking on the recording, but the rest of the \\"album\\" is worth it!
B0031RAOVY|5.0|This movie will touch your heart and soul! It will let you see the ture love between man and his dog you will laugh and cry but mostly you will have a great family night watching this movie with you whole family
B0083SBJXS|5.0|Got this for my hubby as a surprise. We saw it in theaters at least 4 times. Its the Avengers, directed by Joss Whedon and its on blu ray need I say more? :D
B0091REZMW|4.0|this game is awesome. keeps you playing  for hours. it is never ending. I have stopped. playing. since I found this game.
1451695195|2.0|The central theme of the book is wonderful and what the author experienced is no doubt captivating, however I wasn't a fan of the style of writing as I thought there wasn't enough about what the author actually experienced. Yes the big picture and themes were there but most people read for detail not just the big picture. Overall enjoyed the themes of the book more so than the content.
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|The game is quick and easy to learn the challenges get progressively harder, but not impossible. The graphics are great. The story line is cute.
B008EQIA7W|4.0|I love Mythology. I enjoy reading about it, but this movie was way better than expected. In the 2 movies they mentioned every god and the story behind what happened to them.
B002QRWJA4|5.0|I have always enjoyed the music associated with this story. When this movie came out I was swept away with every detail of it. The acting is great, cinematography is beautiful and the music  brings me to tears every time I watch the movie. This is one of my top 10 !
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|I really love this game...it combines bejeweled type fun with a storyline, adventure, treasure hunting and fun.  Love the graphics and the extra brainteasers included.  Really enjoyable!

B005S9EJ14|4.0|a truly feel good movie with a wonderful cast and multiple messages. photography lovely. saw in theater then had to buy thats how good it is!
B005ZMTYBY|4.0|This movie was as entertaining for me as it was for my kids. The music was fresh, the storyline new and memorable. We will watch this movie frequently.
B0083SBJXS|5.0|The Avengers movie was so entertaining. It was a mix of funny and drama. I loved the characters they were so all about their parts. They did a fantastic job. I cant even pick a favorite.I loved the plot and the fight scenes.I watched it several times and was entertained each time. Never a dull moment!
B008XG1X18|5.0|Wonderful app!  Have never had any loading issues.  I use this app everyday. I enjoy searching the diy section. Tons of fun and easy holiday and everyday crafts. :)
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|I've read all the negative reviews. I've only had this app for my kindle fire for about a month and a half but have been very happy with it.  I am enjoying building my town and only go on about once a day, even though I get alerts more often that my energy is back to full.  Hopefully some of the glitches that others have complained about have been fixed.  But for me, so far, so good.
B008673ZAQ|3.0|I could not put down the first book in this series, but this second one was too much!! It was the same stuff over and over again. Why is the chick in this book so dumb!!!???
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|This game is mindlessly addicting!  It's all the fun of those coin games that you see at Dave & Busters or Chuck E. Cheese without the use of real coins.  On the same note, there's no winning of real prizes. My 4 and 6 year old children can easily play this game.
0307278255|5.0|Well written interesting stories that are great for discussion.  Great book for a book club.<br />The stories are about families from India and their interactions with Americans.
B0018QQQKS|5.0|I read this book a few years ago and was impressed.  After purchasing a Kindle I wanted to reread \\"The Ascent Of Money\\" on my Kindle being able to use the dictionary to look up unfamiliar words.  A must read for anyone wanting to better understand economics.
B00846REIS|5.0|Bared to You is a great read.  It is slightly better in my opinion than 50 Shades but still love 50!  I think more people can relate to Bared vs 50.  All in all I loved Bared to You and also the sequel!  Read both in less than a week!
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|Not only did I get the movie rebated with the pre-order guarantee...but it got to my house the day it was released :)<br />I love this movie<br />It had the PERFECT blend of action, humor, thriller, and just plain awesomeness<br />This is how the 3rd best selling movie of ALL time is made :)<br />So can't wait for Avengers 2 to come out
B008R14YBK|5.0|i love the songs everything is on point great to listen while cleaning up or just laying around the house so and listen to this cd she did a good job unlike any of these Disney stars she is her own person
B009HQ9UHC|5.0|I loved Angry Birds, Seasons, and Space, but this one is the best yet!!!!!! I cannot wait to get the full version!!!
B008X9Z37A|4.0|Case fit the Kindle Fire great. Keeps my Kindle Fire protected from dust and my cat. I can leave it on the end table and not worry about it being knocked off by my cat.
B007TBZ63Y|4.0|I enjoyed reading this book! The best parts I liked were the battles, how the seven demigods worked with each other and I enjoyed the book overall. I wonder now that the seven know of the two sides to the Doors of Death, how will they be able to close them? I also am wondering what they should do the Athena Parthenos and how it will bring harmony the gods' Greek and Roman personalities. I am sure that The House of Hades will answer some of these questions and many more that others have.
0316017930|5.0|A superbly written book that dispels the notion that talent is everything, it shows how circumstances are almost as important. In it he shows how sons and daughters of polish immigrants who worked in the textile and clothing industry ended up becoming brilliant lawyers in the corporate world. How Bill Gates became the leader of the computer world and countless other tales. Gladwell's style of writing and his almost conversational style makes the book so hard to put down. I think it is a must for parents, coaches and managers.
B008673ZAQ|4.0|I like this book.  Held my attention and keeps me in suspense for the next book.  I love trilogies but the wait for the final book kills me.
B008XNZMOU|5.0|I am a huge fan of Taylor swift and have bought and cherished her previous Cd Fearless. After loving that album, I honestly feared her next one would leave me slightly disappointed. I needn't have worried though because as it turns out, I love this Cd even MORE!!! Each song is so unique yet relatable. Taylor swift is really growing both musically and lyrically. A must-have for fans. Or just anybody who wants good music!
B008673ZAQ|3.0|The steamy, sexiness of the Fifty Shades of Gray trilogy were what drew me to Bared to You, but I felt like that's all this book was. There just wasn't enough of an actual story in this one until the very end. I'm not trying to sound like a prude because I loved the other books, but I need a more stimulating story to go with all the kinky f'ery to keep me drawn into the book, and I just didn't feel like that existed as much with this one.
B000002JSN|5.0|I took Zep for granted in the 70's, I had no idea how great they were. The proof is in the utter lack of anything remotely as good being produced today. The poor kids today, they'll only have Justin Beiber.<br /><br />Zep is the greatest band ever, and this is their best album.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|I loved all 3 books, but I was a little less impressed with the ending of this one. The finality of it was good, I was happy with it. But as it came to a close, I just felt like there were parts of the story missing in an effort to finish the book. It kinda left me wondering about some of the characters I'd grown to love.
B000OVLBGC|5.0|This German film feels like science fiction, but the 1984-1991 world it depicts actually existed in East Germany.  The story focuses on Captain Gert Wiesler, a domestic surveillance specialist and interrogation expert in the German Democratic Republic.  This Soviet bloc communist-totalitarian state had a spy monitoring project for every 50-or-so citizens.  Wiesler is assigned to watch playwright Georg Dreyman, largely because a higher official is interested in Dreyman's lover and wants to be rid of Dreyman.  As Wiesler listens in on Dreyman's life (whose apartment is bugged) and also observes the behavior of government officials, his loyalty begins to shift.
B003O86FMW|5.0|The entire Hunger Games trilogy did not disappoint! Every day I rushed home from work to bury my brain into my kindle. Loved it! Look forward to the next movie as well.
B0045HCJ94|5.0|We took another look at this film recently and found that it has held up remarkably well. It pulls together a topflight collection:  Edward Albee's play, Mike Nichols in his movie directorial debut, and Elizabeth Taylor and Richard Burton at their very best, well-supported by George Segal and Sandy Denis.  It is a stunning film of two couples entangled in an all-night drunken, no-holds-barred drama.  Uncomfortably real, the movie shines the light on the mix of love and hate and of truth and illusion in a marriage.
0385720920|3.0|The book was a fun read but leaves little behind when done.<br /><br />The characters, plot and settings are self-consciously \\"quirky\\" and the themes were all explored elsewhere by him before, and better.  The main gag (and title) is interesting, but that is a small nugget of substance to add to so much fluff.<br /><br />A funny thing happened, in that, halfway through the book I remembered I had seen this movie somewhere once.  That is how forgettable it is.<br /><br />So, like Chinese food, I am reaching for another book a half hour after this one closes.
B000LXH0AE|5.0|Stranger Than Fiction is about Harold, a tax auditor who has no close relationships and compulsively lives by the clock, counting the number of times he brushes his teeth and the steps he takes to the bus.  He begins to hear a voice in his head narrating his life as it is happening. He seeks counsel from a shrink and a literature professor and discovers that the author whose voice he hears always kills her heroes.  But life is just getting interesting for Harold, who is falling in love with Ana, a baker he is  auditing.  So he seeks out the author to negotiate with her to let him live.  Stranger Than Fiction is a meditation on life, art and romance, and on waking up to life and the kinds of responsibility we have.  Will Ferrel is perfect for the role of Harold and gets great support from the cast, including Dustin Hoffman and Emma Thompson.
B002NZV68U|4.0|Enjoyed the movie, definately different than the first one.  Great job on the animation and special effects.  Would not recommend to little kids could scare them.
B000TGCR38|5.0|I hardly noticed the subtitles in this seamless<br />story of resistance fighters in the Netherlands. The<br />central character in this powerful and compelling<br />World War II thriller is a woman whose heroics<br />match her beauty. Rachel Stein (Carice von<br />Houten) is a Jewish singer in hiding. She is the<br />lone survivor when her family is gunned down by<br />Nazi soldiers. She hooks up with the Dutch<br />resistance and is chosen to infiltrate the Nazis by<br />having an affair with an SS officer. She does what<br />must be done to solve a problem with no<br />stammering or faltering, and without losing her<br />humanity. She is the finest female protagonist I<br />can recall. The haunting quality of this impeccable<br />film lingered with me for days.

B004YM6JI2|5.0|What can I say?  Just that Dean & Sammy Winchester are kicking all kinds of evil butts and looking handsome as usual while doing it.  Never a dull moment and always entertaining.  The best series about supernatural things.
1451695195|5.0|Like other reviews, I was yearning to hear more about his experience vs the scientific analogy ( though I understand what he was trying to translate).  That being said, I truly belive there was a purpose for him to share this story and enjoyed reading every bit of it.  Maybe a second book on the experience itself it more depth?
B0013D8LCW|5.0|I love this movie. I bought it a couple years back and lost it and had to get it again. It came within a few days after placing the order.

0345803485|1.0|It's all been said already in the many negative reviews, so I'm only posting to get my 1 star  vote in. (Or zero stars if they will let me.....). I am mystified by the popularity of this horribly written book. The author lost me with Ana's first \\"Holy Shit\\" reaction to Christian's touch.
B008NABUU8|3.0|Slow and some lag at times. Occasional FC's, but over all a nicely designed game from graphics stand point. The controls need alot of improvement, they can be very frustrating
1608871517|5.0|This book was really great -- esspecially for any MJ fan!  This had many insights into his wardrobe and his style.  It reveals many iconic items and reveals the story behind them, for example the arm band -- I won't reveal the real answer.  Of the letters CTE during the History Period....  So many things I thought I knew, were confirmed or denied by this book and many things I assumed as well.  It has loads of pictures and drawings, and also explains why the author had all the pictures and drawings.  One of my favorites that I will reveal is about the importance of putting all the tour outfits in exact order, otherwise, half way through, by the time Beat it was on set...his pants had to be almost two inches smaller around the waist because by that time, he had already lost 5 pounds of water weight from performing!!  No magic in pants falling down! ha ha - It also explains where many of the designs were influenced from like a movie...or historical figure.  And also little tricks on the clothing to make it look perfect or move a certain way like his tie, but don't touch the shoes!!!  Or innovative ideas like silver boots, or eccentric ideas of his Crown.

B00846REIS|4.0|I was not sure about this book at first. It has a lot of similarities to Fifty Shades, but the story is good and different in its own way. I like that it was not overly done with the sex like Fifty Shades. I ended up thoroughly enjoying this book and stopped comparing it to any books. It held up all on its own. I couldn't help but continue to read on and I am excited to read the second book.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I was expecting a darker book, maybe cuz the 1st one was amazing!<br />Id like the story about his control freekness, and miss Steele trying to go beyond that!
0345803485|1.0|I had read this story back in the days it was a Twilight fanfic because everyone on all the forums was raving on about how \\"awesome\\" it was... I must admit, I read it till the end too (all 3 books, which at that time, were just one story) and it was not only disappointing, but downright maddening.<br /><br />The story in itself is nothing special, what really sets it apart from most of the ones I've read (and I've read a lot) - and I mean this in a tragic and bad way - is the way it portrays BDSM as a whole. [SPOILER ALERT] Christian is this tortured guy who tortures women (there is nothing \\"consensual\\" in the violence, despite what the author would like to make the desperate housewife believe) because of something that happens in his past. Of course, meeting the girl ultimately \\"cures\\" him of these needs of his, which are considered pathological (and granted, in this book they ARE).<br /><br />Such a behaviour has nothing whatsoever to do with BDSM as it's supposed to be, where the motive is not a depressed childhood or some other tragedy. Sadly enough, it matches up with society's beliefs about the whole thing, giving yet again another opportunity to be shocked at people in a consensual Dominant/submissive relationship and thinking they have to be \\"cured\\" like the billionaire in this book.

B008PC1GF8|5.0|This is among Herbert von Karajan's final recordings and it comes back here in a single disk edition for people that still buy compact disks. The recording itself is a little more immediate than earlier versions.<br /><br />Musically, this is in league with a couple other two disk versions of the Nowak and Haas scores from the same period -- [[ASIN:B000001GNS Carlo Maria Giulini's]] recording from Vienna and [[ASIN:B00000E6LD Gunther Wand's]] Lubeck cathedral recording. All three have solid reverential and Brucknerian qualities and, while Wand's has the edge being recorded in concert in the cathedral with its smashing reverberant sonics, there's not a lot else that differentiates the three unless you count against Giulini his tendency to focus on minutiae.<br /><br />I generally consider Karajan overrated as a Bruckner interpreter and think his integral set of the symphonies, while sometimes mighty and Germanic, often unimaginative and regularly showing the bar line. This version of the monolithic Symphony 8 has stood out for years and, now that it's finally available on a single disk, it's a better buy. His fans are happy to have it back; perhaps others can be too.

B000NV55RY|5.0|I enjoyed watching Sharon Tate & Roman Polanski together in his film he starred & directed in.  This was the movie that originally Roman had Jill St. John up for the part that Tate was given I believe.  It took some persuading on Tate's managers part to convince Polanski to meet with Sharon & ultimately decided to cast her in the part.  To me, I wanted to see the interaction between the two to look for any \\"magical chemistry\\" I might pick up on.  This is definitely a '60s made movie  & I found it to be campy & enjoyable to watch.  Knowing the history of Sharon Tate & her husband to be, I wanted to see a part of history of the romance to come.
0316228532|2.0|I had great expectations but really struggled with this much anticipated book..I never finished it..I kept trying but gave up after the third chapter.  She's a great writer but this book never grabbed me.  Should stick to books for kids..
B007GCY8FS|3.0|I have read several of the Jack Reacher novels and all have been good.  This was a great book with a confused and sad ending.  It needed more elaboration at the end and that did not happen.

B009EHDU7U|5.0|Delightfully anarchic, with a wonderful cast of gentle, nutty but believable characters whose actions are entirely logical and inevitable. Beautifully written - the jokes really do work in English as well and there's at least one on every page - and there's a lot of wisdom about human nature and history in there as well. It gives those of us heading towards the one hundred mark hope for a naughty and selfish old age helped by a suitcase full of money and the acquisition of a group of good friends. But the main thing is the humor, and this will surely appeal to every age group.  [[ASIN:B009EHDU7U The One Hundred-Year-Old Man Who Climbed Out The Window And Disappeared]]

0385535147|4.0|Another light, fun and enjoyable Grisham fast read...what an imagination! No courtroom drama here, told through the eyes of a smart convicted lawyer, scheming revenge for his unfair sentencing. For me, it was a real story telling coup...didn't see where the reveal was going, until the beginning of the last 50 pages.<br /><br />Well done Mr. Grisham
B009MCRHH6|5.0|There are few games that make my 'favorite' list, and World of Goo is one of them.  I have it on my PC, my Androids (both Amazon and a DRM-free version), my Wii, my Linux computer, and in my Steam account.  If I had any Apple devices, then I'd have it on there, too.  I love playing this game; it has serious replayability mojo with trying different ways to achieve the goal.<br /><br />2D Boy developer is an \\"indie\\" developer - two guys, actually - and started from the bottom up with this game.  It has won more awards than 99% of all other games, and for good reason. Superb gameplay, an intriguing script, wonderful soundtrack (which, incidentally, they give away for free), and lovable protagonists.<br /><br />I don't like the Network Access permission, but from playing on the other devices I know it is for a unique twist on the multiplayer/leaderboard where you can compete to build the highest tower.  Turning off the access should otherwise not harm the game, and given the history of this app I trust the developers wholly, which, if you have read my other reviews, is truly saying a LOT!<br /><br />Get this epic game, regardless of platform, at least once.  You'll be glad you did. :)<br /><br />P.S., no I don't know or have any affiliations with the developer; I just happen to have witnessed the rise of this game from beta, and think this game is better than most major label games ever produced.<br /><br />[EDIT: changed review to indicate that I have the Amazon version as well, edited the versions and devices, added why I love the game, and inserted a missing word in the network permission sentence.]

Something about one particular shell catches your eye, you pick it up, turn it over, and discover the most incredible weaving of patterns you've ever seen on a shell. How lucky can you get? You take the shell home, and place it on the seashell shelf. This one is a keeper!<br />I feel lucky that I've had the opportunity to read the Wool Omnibus. It is a gift from Mr. Howey to the world.

B003WJQ74E|4.0|This book is like an onion, with many layers of emotion and not-so-subtle challenges to your world-view. If you are reading this review, more than likely you are well-read, middle-class or better, and above-average intelligence. The 'hero' of this book was none of those things, but that all changed with an experiment. Today, you often hear the term differently-gifted to describe persons of lower intellectual capacity. But, broadly speaking, we are all 'differently-gifted.' You may not be gifted athletically, logically, aesthetically, spirtually... Would you be willing to become the \\"most interesting man in the world,\\" but for only a brief time knowing that it would be a fleeting temporary experience? While Charlie doesn't choose, think about yourself. Athletes and many entertainers, in a manner, are very much like Charlie in some ways. Their glory is but a candle, burning bright for an hour. There are many other interesting questions raised between the lines of Charlie's journal.

B009NPKTN6|1.0|I was so excited to watch this movie, and after reading the reviews decided I would rent it. HUGE disappointment. Not funny, not engaging, characters are bland, storyline is drawn out and boring. The only thing I liked was the music, but I could listen to that without having to put up with 2 hours of disinteresting movie in between. I'm sorry to say, but skip this one!
0307454568|3.0|This one picks up immediately where the previous novel leaves off, and simply feels like a logical continuation of TGWPWF, almost as if the second book was enormous and hewn in two. It is unfortunately the most boring of the three, and deals mostly with international conspiracy and the crimes of a secret organization, all expressed in legal nomenclature that was often over this reader's head (though I admit, that's not saying much). Another significant part of it's lackluster quality is the fact that Salander is... out of commission for the majority of the book. The climax, however, was actually quite satisfying, and occurs in the form of an all-encompassing courtroom battle where the bad guys get what's coming to them (and that's not really a spoiler, just in case you haven't read it). Downfalls: Well, like I said, kind of boring and sometimes hard to follow. I daresay this book suffered the most from the authors passing before it was published, because (without meaning to sound disrespectful to Larsson) I think it just could've used a little more editorial polishing.
B000QCS8TW|5.0|I am about 1/3 of the way into the book and loving it.  I knew I would though because I got hooked on the HBO version over the summer.
0307949486|4.0|A smart and startlingly complex mystery with amazing detail, intriguing twists, and one of the most bad-ass heroines I've ever encountered. The sleuthing interaction between Lisbeth Salander and Mikael Blomkvist was enjoyable, and the book's climax is dark and exciting. Downfalls: It took about 150 pages to get interesting. Also, American advertising has put a ridiculous slant on this series because while Lisbeth is without a doubt the most interesting character, she is hardly the main character.
0062127241|1.0|Come on everybody--share the misery! Walk with Pete as he makes one disastrous choice after another. Share in his limitless addictions, especially to sex and alcohol! What fun! Come, revel in mind numbing name dropping of equally despicable humans who lived fearless (no fear of consequences, God or hell, that is) lives of debauchery.  With selfishness so toxic, it would take far more benefit concerts to appease than one lifetime could provide. Want to spend hours and hours with a self absorbed manic depressive? Want to wallow in self destructive excess and dementia? Want to cure yourself of enjoying The Who's music? This book is for you! Finally--all of that suffering with nothing learned, nothing to share with the reader to benefit their lives: except maybe that there would have been no Who without alcohol, pot, LSD, heroin, cocaine, meth, and many other chemicals. And whores aplenty! Half of The Who died by overdose. Townshend miraculously survived. Like me, he needs a Savior. All I got is that God probably created Pete to be a pretty good classical composer. Don't cry, don't be afraid, it's only adult WASTEland--they're all WASTED!
1400032717|3.0|I finally got to The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Nighttime by Mark Haddon last week, and am so very glad I did. A couple months ago my wife tried to read it and put it down after maybe twenty pages, frustrated at the curious (and at times confusing) flow of the story, which is written from the perspective of an autistic 15-year-old boy. Part of the uniqueness (or the confusion, depending on your way of thinking) which isn't explained until a few chapters in is that the chapters are marked with ascending Prime numbers, not linear numbers. So, `Chapter 1' of the book is actually 2., the first prime number, then 3., 5., 7., 11. and so on.The reason for this is that Christopher, the protagonist, adores prime numbers and can recite all of them up to 7,057. He also loves the color red, but despises yellow and brown things, and refuses to let others touch him, including his parents. These are just a few of his many quirks that are revealed as the story goes on.<br /><br />Christopher is also revealed to be incredibly clever and makes up with genius whatever his social skills lack (which is a lot). The book opens with Christopher going out on one of his regular late night walks around the neighborhood and discovering a small poodle, dead, skewered with a garden fork. This sets his obsessive personality on an unquenchable quest to know why this dog is dead and who has done the deed. In that regard, it is mildly a `mystery' story, but this event is really only a springboard for the author to really unfold Christopher's character.<br /><br />Since it is Christopher actually `writing' the book, the chapters leap around a lot and describe what is going on in Christopher's head. His interactions with people are mostly very flat and calculated, and he only likes a very few of the people in his life because the rest of them just confuse him. The pages are filled with little pictures, mathematical proofs and drawings in between the text which Christopher has helpfully included to help flesh out his daily experiences. These are a fun addition that give a more personal impression that you are perhaps reading someone's journal or diary rather than a novel.<br /><br />Haddon writes with unique voice and well communicates how an autistic boy might think and evaluate the world. He also does a fantastic job of weaving in reverent and sometimes sad observations on the human condition through the mouth of this strange yet very likeable young man. Christopher's black and white way of seeing things is often humorous (to the reader, not to him) and pokes fun at the things we do so regularly that are maybe a bit ridiculous once you think about it.<br /><br />Ever since I read Jonathan Safran Foer's Extremely Loud & Incredibly Close (which to this day I can pretty safely say is my favorite book ever), I've been subconsciously on the hunt for another book with so much character and creativity. Curious Incident is largely different and I didn't love it quite as much as I do Foer's book, but it's probably the closest second I've ever found; oddly enough both books are written from the perspectives of young boys with lots of imagination. I also appreciate it when an author goes outside the norm with typesetting, which this book does to some degree.<br /><br />Overall, it was a fun and engaging read, with a surprising amount of depth and emotion. Also, a pretty impressive first novel.d to help flesh out his daily experiences.

0345404475|3.0|Blade Runner came out in 1982, but I was only introduced to it about 5 years ago when a film-buff sort of friend insisted we sit down and watch it together. He showed me The Director's Cut, which is one of several alternate edits of the film. Watching it with this friend, named Stewart, vastly enriched my first experience with the movie because he was able to talk me through some of the underlying themes and point out key moments that nerds have debated over for decades. By the end of my first time seeing it through, I wasn't entirely sure what I had just seen or what it meant, but I was highly intrigued and almost immediately wanted to watch it again. Since that time I've watched it at least once a year, and have come to prefer The Final Cut, the most recently released and most extensive version of the film.<br /><br />Last week, I read the 1968 novel Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep? which Blade Runner is loosely based on, in fact I can't stress enough just how loosely. It's more like the movie takes a couple of key ideas from Androids and creates it's own totally separate story that might take place in the same universe as the book. Understand, I'm not bashing the movie at all, in fact I think it is quite a remarkable film that accomplishes much on it's own, largely due to Ridley Scott's impressive directorial vision. It's a movie I can watch over and over and not grow tired of. This is because it's just a visually fascinating sci-fi cult-classic, but also because there are so many mysterious and ambiguous moments that no matter how many times and how closely you watch them, you're not quite sure what they're supposed to mean...<br /><br />I picked up the book trying my best to keep the movie out of my mind and just approach it as a completely separate entity. This worked pretty well. The book's first half focuses heavily on Rick Deckard's strong desire to own an authentic living animal. In Philip K. Dick's version of the future, real animals are extremely expensive and have become largely extinct. Humans instead own electronic mimics of animals if they cannot afford the real thing, but this is a shameful societal position to be in and one would never want to have to admit their animal was fake.<br /><br />Along with animals, there are virtually flawless humanoid robots, called Replicants, living (illegally) among humans on Earth that have immigrated secretly from off-world colonies. The most advanced and human-like of these androids are models called Nexus-6. Most of them are infused with false memories and not even aware that they are robots. Rick Deckard's job is to seek out these androids, confirm that they are not human by way of an eye-dilation test that measures empathy, and `retire' them if they are in fact replicants. He works for a sort of branch of police and is simply titled a bounty hunter. The movie obviously calls him a blade runner, but that term is nowhere to be found in the book.<br /><br />Though it had some unique ideas, I would be hard-pressed to necessarily call Androids a good book... I will say it baffles me that this book was written in the sixties, and I do firmly believe that Dick had an imagination far beyond his time. Yet his writing leaves a little something to be desired in the sense that his characters' dialogue is at times choppy and I found it difficult to discern exactly what he was trying to portray through them. It's hard to explain, but I felt that at times his flow would skip a beat and leave me, the reader, a bit in the dark as to how he had gotten to that current moment. I'm completely willing to admit that this may have been intentional on his part and was used as a literary device, and that I'm just simply not getting it. There are definitely some tones in the book about the blurring of dreams and reality, which makes for some abstract, dream-like scenes. Another strong theme is what truly defines being human.<br /><br />I find myself having the rare opinion that in this case, the movie was ultimately better than the book. But really that's not exactly fair because they have so little to do with each other that they ought to be considered separately. I can say that reading the book did enrich the movie for me in small ways, and helped me further understand the roots of some of the movie's themes.<br /><br />So, if you've read the book: good for you. If you haven't read it but enjoy the movie: don't even worry about it. If you haven't seen the movie: you're a silly goose. Go rent it immediately, experience it for yourself, then deconstruct it endlessly with the rest of us.he movie was ultimately better than the book.

B007QPFGJW|5.0|One of, if not the, best Harry Hole book.. a real page turner! It grabs you from page one...having read the prior titles in the series is helpful but not essential.
0307949508|5.0|Though it starts out a little odd, it quickly changes to an exciting, swift-moving story of unearthed corruption and mounting opposition for the main characters. It is still a mystery of sorts, but reads more like a spy novel or a fast-paced investigation. I personally liked this one best out of the three because it focuses most heavily on Salander, explains more of her past, and reveals her abilities at the top of their form. It also contains the most action, and some outlandish yet fun new characters. The last 100 pages fly by and the ending is an epic cliffhanger. Downfalls: Salander's actions at the beginning of the book seemed completely out of character for her, which bothered me because I just couldn't picture her in those situations (the whole tropical island bit). But after all it's just fiction so what does that really matter...

I believe I started it in July, and just now finished it... Granted, I've been reading a few other things, and it is 1092 pages long in paperback.<br /><br />The book was written before I was born, so obviously it's been around awhile and is no mystery to the literary world. The TV-miniseries in the 90's obviously added to it's popularity and has made it one of King's best-known (and loved) works. All that to say, this review is about 25 years late, and probably everything said in it has been said before, but hey, just think of me as a second-generation King reader who is re-discovering his talent.<br /><br />Anyone who knows even the smallest bit about this book probably knows it is (in the most basic sense) about a clown terrorizing some kids, and then coming back and haunting them 27 years later as adults. Sounds simple right? Then why the 1000+ pages? Because King is a master of elaboration and detail, although in my opinion not the `boring kind' (like in English fiction when some cheeky fellow takes 50 pages to tell you what the grass on the rollicking hills is like).<br /><br />If I may make the comparison, in some of his books, King is similar to Quentin Tarantino's storytelling. Let me explain. King's character development often involves letting you just `hang out' with the characters for a while; moving through life with them and experiencing some moments that do give great depth to the person, but don't necessarily move the plot forward directly. If you think about, Tarantino often does this same thing. His movies are usually long. I think my point can be most clearly seen in Death Proof, which is not necessarily a favorite of mine, but the full version is nearly three hours, and practically half of that time is spent with the characters, just sitting around talking. Their dialogue isn't really relevant to the tale, but it expands your perception and understanding of them. Without beating the comparison to death, I think King uses a similar method.<br /><br />In the book, a significant amount of pages are spent with each of the 6 main characters (there is also a 7th on whom significantly less time is spent) as children and as adults; the narrative sort of switches back and forth in time from 1958 to 1985. There are also 5 first-person Interludes about the city of Derry itself, in which the book takes place.<br /><br />With such a monstrous novel, it is hard to know where to begin or what to focus on, so I'll guess I'll just mention a few things. The characters are great; very well balanced, yet diverse in personality, which makes for great dialogue, and each one's talents or abilities end up playing a key role in defeating IT. King also does an amazing job of portraying the world from an 11-year-old's viewpoint, which is about how old they are in the beginning of the book.<br /><br />The villains are superbly crazy and menacing. Apart from Pennywise the Clown himself and all the derivative shapes he takes on, there is a psychotic and intensely abusive husband who is married to the female main character in the `Grown-ups' part of the book, and a group of bullies with an equally psychotic leader in the `Kids' portion. This makes for many intense moments, and there are portions of the book where it seems nearly impossible for the protagonists to escape the mounting opposition against them (which is what good conflict is all about).<br /><br />The book is creepy. Really creepy. Pennywise is practically invincible, has lived for (at least suggestively) thousands of years, feeds on freaking little kids, and takes on the shape of whatever the seer is most afraid of. Within the first twenty pages, he rips off a little boy's arm trying to pull him down a storm drain. Did I mention the book is violent?<br /><br />Anyway, this is getting long and not going much of anywhere. But the book is fantastic; honestly one of the best books I've ever read. If you're okay with just hanging out with characters for awhile, intense gory violence, some sexual content, and a whole heck of a lot of detail, you'll probably enjoy this.<br /><br />I think the most incredible thing about the book is the scope of the world King creates. When you finish this book, take a breath, and think back over all the moments and events, you feel as if you have spent a lifetime with these characters, and had your nose right to the grind along with them through thick and thin. That, to me, is powerful fiction, and damn good storytelling.<br /><br />In other news, I just picked up King's new one that came out last week, Full Dark, No Stars. It's his 4th or 5th collection of Novellas (not even counting his half a dozen other short-story collections), or `short-novels,' most of them about 100 pages each or so. I very much appreciate that King still consistently publishes short works; one, because I think short-fiction is the hardest to do well, and second, because hardly anyone else is doing it anymore. I suppose it's not marketable enough unless you have a big name.<br /><br />After this one, I'll probably give King a break for a while, not because I'm sick of him, but because I have an ever-growing stack of modern-classics and other things that I'd like to get to. May I recommend reading IT over your next summer break? It'll take you the whole time, I guarantee.ook is fantastic; honestly one of the best books I've ever read.

B0096YBEIS|5.0|I have been Fourplay's number one fan from the beginning and they have never come close to disappointing me and my family. They are truly a supergroup of smooth jazz. The Best of the Best and just like a fine wine they get better with time! The album is amazing for it moves me to a higher plain of thinking and relaxing... It makes you look back to a more gentler and innocent time of your life when you smile alittle bit more and laugh to your heart's content. It's smooth, it's amazing, it,s Fourplay!!!
B0052RDHTM|5.0|Just like Pillars of the Earth, I cannot put this down. I am into last few pages of Book One.<br />I will be continuing with Book Two.<br />Recommended.
6305428042|5.0|This has been a family favorite of ours for years! This was my favorite movie as a child and it's now my son's favorite!
B0084I9QI2|5.0|amazing and a must have for MJ fans....It was EVERYTHING i had hoped for and then some....I Highly recommend this product for anyone that loves MJ....
B008673ZAQ|5.0|You know a book is well written when a reader, like me, cannot pick the book up to finish it because I am too anxious, my heart is pounding and my mind is racing. Sylvia writes so powerfully that the characters  emotions are bounded into you blood stream.<br /><br />I literally had to pause and stop the book because I hated what as happening, I also was eager t finish it and get it over with because the emotions and suspense was too much!<br /><br />Not many writers have that ability. I feel what Eva feels, I am on pins and needles, emotionally trapped with the words Sylvia has written.<br /><br />Amazing book I can't wait for the last installment! It pisses me off I have to wait so long too! But it's well worth it
B006M7JCC2|5.0|The reason this book about NDE was so different, is that the author told in detail about how it effected her life afterwards...how she lived with the knowledge she learned by her experience.  Heard before, but not heard like this.
B008NW67E0|5.0|Great album. Buy it to listen you will not be disappointed if you are already a Mumford and sons fan.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|This game started off as a time killer for me.  With the prizes and puzzle pieces, I am finding myself addicted to this game.  I can't wait for more coins to be replenished!
B00846REIS|2.0|I like to read love stories. This book had too much detailed sex for me. I recommend this if you like erotic books, I don't recommend it if you just like classy love stories.
B007IXWL2C|3.0|I'm still reading this book but it definitely hasn't kept my interest as much as the first two books.  The \\"F\\" word seems to be a common vocabulary word in this book as well.  I plan on finishing reading it but really do think the author should have stopped at book 2.
B0098VYCCE|2.0|This movie was bad enough but when you throw in Kristen Stewart it is almost unbearable to watch. Would not recommend, this is two hours of my life I wasted!
B008673ZAQ|5.0|I love this story. It is a more modern love story. I read it twice after the 50 shades trilogy and want More!<br />Hope the next one sheds more light into Gideon Cross background now that we know all about Eva Tramell,<br />Silvia you have me captured!
B009GEBBNQ|5.0|Awesome! Loved this movie, one of the best of the year. Can't wait until the sequel comes out. Highly recommend.
B002M3SP28|5.0|This was an extremely good book.  I could hardly stop reading it.  Jeffrey Archer never lets me down!<br />His books are captivating and holds your attention until the very end of the story and often leaving me with the desire to ready more and more! Documentation was great!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This a very entertaining book and i would recommend it to anyone i am glad i decided to read it
B001MTENOC|4.0|Ever wonder what you were before you entered this life?  Journey of Souls provides a different perspective than that of floating around strumming a harp.
B0082RHRHC|5.0|Many of us read Jane Eyre in school, and perhaps found the dialects, moody setting, and pace a challenge.  What a refreshing experience to re-read the book as an adult, with a lifetime of experiences to add to our understanding.<br />The wispersync function allowed me to continue on with the narrative on long commutes when I couldn't continue reading, and the quality of the audio is wonderful.  I encourage anyone who has dismissed Jane Eyre as a book relegated to their past to investigate it for insights into feminism, patriarchy, class, suffering, and forgiveness. I think they will find the human heart has not changed.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|I usually only read on the treadmill at the gym but this book grabbed me and kept me.  I read it whenever I had a few minutes and it was painful when I couldn't just keep going.  Reading on a Kindle, I wasn't paying attention to how much I'd read and was at the end before I new it - BOOM... it was over and left me wanting more.  The next book isn't available yet so I grabbed another Sylvia Day book.  I love them! All well written with stories and passion! Whew!
0385344333|2.0|Where to begin with the downhill slide that Reacher is on? Spoiler alerts ahead.<br /><br />The only reason this gets two stars is because he finally kicks some behind at the end of the book. Counter that with an odd recitation of the most esoteric facts over and over ad nauseum-Reacher counting the words in sentences, playing number games with the bad guys, computing mileage and distances and travel times like a computer and somehow knowing the demographics and telephone area codes to various cities around the country even though all he ever seems to do is roam around the country getting into conflict. How does he keep up with it? How does he know it all? Because, as Reacher says, he is a person who likes facts. I kept waiting for Tom Cruise to show up and I don't mean playing the part of Reacher in a movie.<br /><br />And how does he make some of the leaps of logic he makes in this book? For example, \\"the guy is wearing a sweater so he's not armed.\\" WHAT!!!! How do you get there? Read and be amused. And he can somehow see old military trailers and a couple of offices full of books and paperwork and deduce the entire conspiracy the book is based upon.  Yet despite the brilliance of Reacher he maintains his gruff demeanor and answers \\"I\\"m just a guy\\" to questions about who he is or \\"I'm just going to see a girl\\" when asked where he is heading or the doozy about \\"I've only been here 20 minutes\\" when questioned about killing a dozen armed terrorists so quickly. Still, Reacher can somehow assault an FBI agent and steal his gun in front of other agents and then convince them to bring him on a barricaded hostage rescue.....with pistols.<br /><br />Let's not forget either that Reacher can be involved in, or a material witness to, up to two dozen murders (not to mention the book's conspiracy) across three states and these same agents just let him walk away to disappear. Similarly, Reacher is skilled and talented enough to defeat all these bad guys, killing one after another after another and meticulously track his bullet count and yet somehow be so damn stupid he can't just rearm himself with their weapons and ammo.<br /><br />It just got to be so boring and ridiculous that at the end when two bad guys had their guns trained on Reacher's chest and their fingers were tightening and he was really about to die (but you know he won't-there's not even any tension to the scene) I found myself wishing the author would put us all out of our misery.<br /><br />I say screw you Lee Child, you have jumped the shark.
B004WY2M8I|5.0|As much as I enjoyed S. Meyer's 'Twilight', this series is on another level entirely. And I can fully see why she had to give a nod to Anne Rice in her first book. These are wonderfully written, deep, sumptuous characters and story-lines and contain all the basics for the other's novels; including the angst over drinking humans, sparkling and mind reading. Read these first and you'll never look back.
1455502758|5.0|This is one of the most touching and enlightening books I ever read. Courageous and strong, Hitchens sets himself apart as a powerfully endowed human being, fearless of superstitions and facing the inevitable that no church or prayer can change, punish or forgive.
B009HSVHV2|5.0|Kiss Monster is great. Straight ahead Rock and Roll. Gene and Paul are still cranking it after 40 years. My favorite tracks are The Devil is Me, Wall of Sound, Freak & Hell or Hallelujah.
B0098XY5VK|5.0|This is an amazing game! Y'all should all play it! It's very entertaining! <33 At first it's kind of confusing & hard, but once you get the hang of it it's very fun! Download it NOW! :)
1465001107|5.0|Just got the calendar today and I love it. I only wish there were also pix of the Dangerous and History area. It seems to me as if there only pix of the Bad area.
B006470HZ6|5.0|I love everything about this show.  The storyline is fantastic.  While it may be slow at times and focus more on the main characters, I really like that about the show.  This show seems much more like what the world and those trying to survive in it would be like as compared to the other action packed zombie films who pay little attention to the actual story.
B008N1LL42|5.0|Watched this movie at least 5 times and still enjoy it! The actors are all super and it is good to see Rhiana in her first movie!
B006VA4NJC|5.0|This series is completely engaging and as informative as it is entertaining.  The story captured us and the characters enticed us through the strength of the actors portraying them.  It is just a wonderful experience.  Be sure to watch the first season before this season.  While this season can stand on its own, the first season really develops the story and chapters.
B0083SBJXS|5.0|very good story, the detail  was great. if you love the comic book movies you will love this one!!!! i can not wait for the sequel
B007KQI1NA|4.0|This receiver gives me the best accuracy I've had in any gps. The only problem I've had is using it in linux. It it recognized but uses DGPS by default and for some reason kicks it into sirf mode. It needs to then be discharged or use sirfdemo to reset it to nmea mode.
B009329Y30|3.0|The movie was a cute love story. I enjoyed watching it with my daughter and boyfriend. Not sure I would watch it again however not bummed I ordered it.
1455502758|3.0|I loved this: David Bentley Hart in his [[ASIN:0300164297 Atheist Delusions: The Christian Revolution and Its Fashionable Enemies]] of Hitchens \\"[His] talent for intellectual caricature somewhat exceeds his mastery of consecutive logic\\" and whose recent book \\"raises the wild non sequitur almost to the level of a dialectical method\\"\\"<br /><br />You know, I used to fear Hitchens. He seemed so intelligent, and sophisticated and confident. It was only after he died and I watched a video of him recorded a few months before his death, that I decided to listen to his arguments. I was genuinely moved by the video, and saw a man staring death in the face, and being honest about it. I respected him.<br /><br />But his debates were another story! My goodness, I could have gone in there with him! Some of the opponents did a good job I feel, but others let great chances slip by. Like when he would pull out his 'Immoral Bible' Card. I simply couldn't see on what foundation he could stand on from which to throw stones at the Bible's morality. He waxed lyrical about the atrocities of the OT, and do we really want to return to that? Can we really trust a God who orders His people to slaughter men women and children mercilessly? But from what absolute point does he start from? Darwinian evolution? His brother did pick up on it, but in response this so called \\"horseman of the apocalypse\\" would just waffle on, as if the point had not been raised. It was a liberating moment really. I knew I would never fear an atheist again!
B0090X4HES|4.0|First off Kendrick is great in his own.<br />but this. this is crazy. devin the dude is one of my favorites and now kindrick is got the same thing going. i am so glad i have found some rappers i can believe in again....
B004SJ3AXI|5.0|I have the season 3 update on my android smartphone where's the update for the kindle fire as I'd really like to play it on a bigger screen?
B00913DPW2|2.0|I enjoy the missing objects games, but this one is unplayable. There are no instructions, other than to drag and click the objects.<br />I did get inside the house, but then nothing happened. No menu popped up, and clicking and dragging various objects did nothing. I'm disappointed in the game.
B00902MCVY|5.0|This is my first review on Amazon. I don't typically review anything and I feel I must do this somewhere on a site that is well trafficked.<br /><br />This album should be a must own for anyone who is a fan of the original Wintersun release back in 2004.<br /><br />The only drawbacks to this album are the shortness and the fact that if you are paying attention the Japanese elements are not true instruments. However I, unlike others, are not removing stars from this as I know Time II will be here soon to pair with.<br /><br />The quality of the digital orchestrations is overall simply incredible. I'm not even a big fan of Symphonic metal in general as there is a huge cheese factor within alot of it for me. I do however appreciate a well produced soundtrack and this might be why my enjoyment is so high for Time I.<br /><br />Over 1500 tracks have gone into the production of these 5 songs.  If you purchase the DVD you will see the hard work that went into this and it shows.  If you've been following the band, you are already aware of the setbacks that Jari had getting this out.  There's some teasers out there too of who is in the choir.<br /><br />The sound quality is amazing. You can hear so many layers if you are listening for it. You can get pleasantly lost listening to a few minor tracks in the background.  If you have your mid range real low, you'll notice some sound fluctuations, you'll want to bring that up for this album to hear everything going on.<br /><br />The music is not unlike what I would imagine an amazing ride on the back of an Ice Dragon while doing battle with terrible legions of orcs while snow and stars rain down around me!  I can't really describe it any better! It's beautiful, enrapturing, sends chills down the spine and really just puts you in a trance.  If you get the DVD you will see some amazing studio performances that will leave you gripping the arms of your chair.<br /><br />I can't stress enough how important it is to support by purchasing the music of someone you truly enjoy and attending the shows if possible, buying a t-shirt and whatnot. It's a shame they are not headlining in the US.<br /><br />Please do so for Jari, Jukka, Teemu and Kai! They most certainly deserve it! True talent!ng the music of someone you truly enjoy and attending the shows if possible, buying a t-shirt and whatnot.

086571701X|4.0|So, you go online to learn about aquaponics and three hours later you've got so much information about so many different aspects and methods that it's hard to say what's what. Add to that the potential scam factor and the monster web has not helped too much. Aquaponics forums are great, but don't expect and A to Z that you can hold in your hands (unless you're using barrels or IBCs). Enter Aquaponic Gardening. It is a step by step guide. It does not give all the detail that you need, or at least that I need. I'm still online, using the forums. The difference is that now I know what I'm looking at, and where it fits in the overall plan. In a project that requires both a big picture and minute details, a book like this is completely worth it's price. For a single volume to encompass the whole thing...well, it would be great, and it would be a great big volume. Start here, and then use the webs to seek out the little details that you need.
B002CIY8EM|2.0|Good idea but the writer does not hold my interest.<br />Wish he would have written his ideas in a story line.  Maybe the movie would be more interesting.
B0094U0RJQ|5.0|Tempest is another Dylan's masterpiece. I can listen over and over and do not get bored. I recommend for all liking the flavor of good music.
B0036BK6MW|5.0|Wonderful movie, have watched it many times,and enjoy having a copy of my own to watch any time I want.
B005LAIHXQ|1.0|This is not a review of the DVD. I'm sure it is quite delightful, however the movie sucked. I'll give it 1 star because of special effect. Not because they were good FX, just because they had some. (FYI - you can't give 0 stars). As other reviews have noted there isn't any science in their fiction. The tie in to the Alien movie(s) is really weak. What really bugged me was when the girl that did a caesarian to extract the alien and then hops off the table and runs down the hall. I took my wife 24 hours before she could stand up.
0470901071|5.0|An excellent book to use for your CCNA study, I passed my CCENT with a score of 937. I recommend this book.
B009GQ57ES|5.0|I started listening to Macklemore after he performed at Songfest at USC. I love how he keeps his music varied, ranging from the meaningful songs like Otherside and Wings to fun songs like Castle and And we Danced
B008GVD6D8|5.0|Loved it - waited too long, and now waiting again for part three!! Ever so slightly predictable, but thoroughly enjoyable none-the-less!
B004GYY714|5.0|if you like listening to the radio get this app NOW! you can search artists, stations, and songs and it gives you tons of options to choose from. great app! its a must buy!!!
B004UNX1LS|5.0|the only bad thing is the error part but besides that its great I love it its finally a decent app with vevos
B00932HEX2|1.0|This should be rated R. I was not amused by graphic display of intercourse in first 5 minutes. I simply am not interested in how the government manipulates these things. I didn't buy this series and do not know where it came from. I'll give you that we have some nasty enemies, but very few Muslims are involved.
B000000OF6|4.0|This was purchased as a gift.  Person wanted a specific song which this set has and it was a bonus to be able to get the set at a great price. I am certain he will be surprised & pleased to receive.
0385344333|1.0|As many others, I'm a big Lee Child fan.  I love the Jack Reacher character and was very excited about this book.  Sadly, though, I found myself setting it down in the middle of scenes that were supposed to be exciting, willing to move on to another task rather than push through this book as I normally have through a Reacher book.  In the beginning, I found myself looking forward to the action scenes to get the book moving rather than plodding along, but even the action scenes didn't have the same believability factor of previous books.<br /><br />I was disappointed.  Hopefully next time we'll see a better effort from Mr Child.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|I was staying up till midnight more than once with this book. I can't wait until the next book comes out! Rick Riordon, KEEP IT UP! ;{D
B004LWZWGK|4.0|Let me begin by saying I am a devoted Batman fan.  I know the material, the games, the gadgetry, etc.  So if my review comes off a bit too harsh or perhaps too critical, it is only because this is one character I notice when something isn't done right.  That being said, let's begin...<br /><br />This is by far an excellent movie.  All of the elements that make an epic concluding tale are present; definately on the level of the second installment.  This movie will, and by no means is this an understatement, literally have you watching anxiously until the very end.  But like any movie, there are some plot holes, in this case not major, and in no way will they take away from the overall plot or film itself.<br /><br />One - Bane's voice.  Really, Bane in general, let's get down to the foundation.  Bane by way of the comics is a foreigner, some say spanish, some say brazilian, doesn't matter, just either way he's not a white guy.  I'm not racist nor do I intend to come off that way, but I personally feel in cases like this, when it's clear that you have a non-american character, and you can easily get one, Hollywood cheaps out and just throws the role to a white guy.  Tim Hardy-excellent actor.  And as Bane, convincingly terrifying.  But the accent just wasn't there.  I mean honestly, it sounded more like \\"Jack Ryan, you've just boarded the Red October!\\"....Sean Connery.  And the muzzle only made it worse on the ears.  So now you have a British accent that's drowned out by the latest facewear from the SPCA.  So by far, I recommend SUBTITLES ON when watching.<br /><br />Two - Catwoman, rather, a feminine cat burglar as I believe she's described in the film.  Anne Hathaway was an okay addition to the cast.  Would I have casted her as Catw...*ahem* a female cat burglar? No.  Selina Kyle is among the sexier, perhaps among the sexiest characters in the DC universe.  I apologize if I sound sexist ladies, but that being considered, I don't see Anne Hathaway as a sexy woman.  Isee her as, the girl who had it rough in Devil Wears Prada, or the innocent little princess, but not as a sex symbol.  Not that that is all Catwoman is about, but it is what you expect considering her character.  Her perfomance was okay, just not sexy.  And I don't feel it was just for her to. . . I don't want to give anything away for those who haven't seen the movie.  But let me just say that was Batman's place to take care of....\\"that situation\\".  And the overly long kiss at the end?  That was just bad timing.<br /><br />Three - No mention whatsoever is made of Joker.  Not even the tiniest reference.  And this point may be unimportant at all, but for the damage he did to the city and to Bruce's pshyche, they could have at least said something about, I don't know, \\"Glad they managed to keep him in Arkham all this time\\", or something like that to let the audience know he didn't just stay hanging upside down indefinately.  Also, Bruce Wayne's magical brace?  Come on.<br /><br />Four - Last and final point, and this one is a spoiler alert so don't read ahead if you can't handle it.  But the character of Robin John Blake was a bit stretched.  You were able to deduce Batman's identity by the way he came into an orphanage?  Riiiight.  And in the event that the saga continues, Robin is a sidekick character, thus the Batman and Robin series.  Where could you go with him?  I'll tell you where, Nightwing, or even better, a Batman Beyond.  But now I'm trailing off topic.<br /><br />Other than the above, I have no gripe against the movie whatsoever.  The movie is simply epic.  Inspiring at times, tragic in others, but surprising throughout.  Especially that one big one.  Ultimately, I will be adding this to my collection the day it comes out, and I suggest that you do the same.  You will not be dissappointed.
B008KEQM3W|4.0|This movie not only had the expected funny parts about pregnancy, it had some surprisingly tender moments that overall led to making this a very enjoyable movie for us to watch as a couple with kids!
B008XJM6NY|2.0|The Green Day Uno Deluxe was not really much of a deluxe product.  The only difference was sticker and a larger box, but the box was crushed in transit.  I did like the music, just thought I was taken on the \\"deluxe\\" factor.  I expected to have at the least a bonus track or live tracks.
B008PWUYVA|4.0|I bought a hard sleeve for my Kindle Fire that cost about the same as this one. The sleeve is...okay. It protects the device and doesn't take up any more space, really than the Kindle Fire itself does.<br /><br />But...I realized that what I wanted was a case with a built-in stand. Without that, I hardly used the Fire because I didn't feel like taking it in and out of the sleeve and then trying to prop it up on something--which rarely worked.<br /><br />This jacket is what I was hoping for (with one exception). It gives the protection--has a sturdy reinforced back, is trim, opens and closes securely and easily and -- best of all -- it STANDS. Stands, as in the picture, horizontally (the way I use it most often).<br /><br />Two days in, and this has already made such a difference in the amount I'm using the Fire and the convenience of it. 4 Star product for me--not a 5 star--because it can't stand vertically. I didn't realize this when I first wrote this review and have changed it to reflect that.<br /><br />I watch media horizontally, which this does so well, but I like to read vertically--something this case -doesn't- do.
B007THA4FI|4.0|I knew nothing about the book prior to reading. Found it to be an enjoyable read. Character development was interesting and believable.
B0014JKJHK|2.0|I bought these shoes because I'm a cook and I wanted comfortable shoes that were slip resistant and would allow me to stand on my feet all day. They are quite comfortable for standing for several hours. However, they are NOT slip resistant as they advertise. It is dangerous for me to work in a kitchen without slip resistant shoes, which is why I bought some work boots to replace these. It's truly a bummer, especially since they are comfortable.
B0096DFBZQ|2.0|effort is something I don't think they necessarily put onto this game, but then again I don't think they were trying to be lazy about it either<br /><br />Pros: the idea of a pac man kart race is not an atrocious concept. there were enough characters to play from and the song was pretty catchy when you start. the setup was decent and the levels looked moderately okay.<br /><br />Cons: The menu, character selection, and other etcs aren't as fluid in their animation as most 3D games on here. the controls are skeptical. I figured you'd have a touchscreen joystick and two buttons for the brake and the gas, but I ran into a tree before realizing the controls are at the far end of my pad, which was so weird to play with. there honestly was no need to have a jump button at the MIDDLE of the screen, let alone anywhere else. the item variety is too limited and doesn't always benefit except for the boost. The biggest pet peeve was how limited you are on this game. no trial, no nothing. only one tournament. one character. one race. and that's it. they tease you saying &quot;would you like the full version&quot;?<br /><br />-INSTANT GAME DELETION-<br /><br />if you're going to have a demo version, at least have some variety. most demos wouldn't leave us 99% of little options to use. and the naminagion needs some work. its not all bad, but more time into this would have made this game a really good mario-kart spinoff for the Kindle fire. hopefully you guys are able to do an update for additional configuration on the game.<br /><br />I'm not a game developer (yet)  but I'm sure with this type of general criticism, it will bring you guys to having new innovation and ideas.
B0017XD3OY|4.0|i love  it is good and i  love this kind story about the end of the world.  nice to see it again and again...
B007MS5B6Q|5.0|so this is amazing the quality and the detail of the head and blu-ray are incredible I'm really glad. I hope that the first season has his own special edition too.
0307749606|5.0|A must read!!! Jack Reacher at his finist!!! Lee Child has done it again! Get your copy today. Five out of five stars for me!.
B004WGGQPQ|5.0|Great little app - my seven-year-old daughter loves it!  There is a wide variety of simulated mediums (pencil, marker, crayon, paint, etc.) and dozens of colors for each medium.  Plus, there are stickers.  It's kept my girl quietly occupied for hours.  I have it on my phone, so the screen/canvas was on the small side (though it was still usable,) and the memory requirement is a bit heavy for my wimpy phone.  The app itself is a lot of fun, though!
B005IA9JZO|5.0|Yes, I watched this movie when I was younger (on vhs) I belive I saaw it in the theater but I am not sure. I just remembered having fond memories of it. so when I got it on dvd I was still happy with it, and then when I purchased the blu ray I found that this movie can still make me happy. The overall look of the film, the colors, the intricacies of the detail, all pop out at you as it did when it was first released. The movies from this era have a more tangible feel, as little to no cgi is used, and real sets are the standard not the exception. The characters are fully realized. Hook is a man growing old and wanting to recapture his heyday. Peter has grown up and became responsible. Unfortunately he has forgotten how it is to be young at heart, and his job makes him both a bad parent and a bad husband, though he does love his family. Tinger Bell is the only downer in this movie. I am not really a fan of Roberts. And she does an ok job for this movie. But I feel she was picked because she was the it-girl of the time. She just wasn't the right girl. In my opinion Drew Barrymore would have been better. She might have been younger but she was a fairy, and so the whole \\"age\\" thing wouldn't have been a factor, had Peter stayed in Neverland he too would still be the same age. I just thought she would have been a better choice, and also has ties to Spielberg from E.T. That being said, this is a fun movie, and it's a movie about taking time. Enjoying every moment, spending those precious few moments we can with the ones we love. And it's about how quickly time passes, and how we all would like something to show for the time we have spent. For Peter that was his wife and kids, for Hook it was his glory days that he could never recapture. Age was not kind to him.<br /><br />The humor is natural and sincere. When the lost boys and Peter have a war of words it seems like a bunch of kids going at it on a playground. Only one can come out on top. And using Peter's kids to get himto fight him again, Hook shows how little he has changed, even though the world around him has. And when Peter's daughter exclaims \\"Peter Pan is my dad?\\" we all can share in the excitement of Peter returning to form. I did think it curious when Tink calls him a silly ass, considering this was a child's movie (but like most children movies, there is always something in there that the adults might find more interesting than the kids will) but that is true to the book. While many find the reimagining of Peter's world a bit hard to take, this was one of the first movies I saw that did this. Where they take an old story and update it, but leaving the characters who they are supposed to be. Unlike the remake of Romeo and Juliet (starring Dicaprio) this reimagining makes since in the neverland world. This movie proves you are never too old to feel young. The truth of our existence lies in the lives that we touch. For better or for worse and despite our shortcomings there are those in this world who will always love us and need us. Growing up doesn't mean you have to get old. And this movie is timeless. Watch it again, and watch it with friends or with family or a child in your life. Watching their eyes light up will make you feel young again. Or watch this movie for the first time, and see how real storytelling can still be the most important part of a movie. CGI is great in some instances, but there is no substitution for real sets and real actors. So sit back and enjoy. Afterwards you'll feel as if you could chase down pirates too.
1608871517|5.0|Michael Bush did it he talks about all of Michael's inconic styles and how they came about, I got the book this afternoon and even though I didn't feel good possibly the flu, I almost finished the book.  He tells great stories about how Michael would give him a riddle or a book and say a few words are just say click and how he would interpret this as to what look Michael was looking for.  I really liked this book because it takes you into Michael's artistic side of a true artist. Michael loved his clothes to look like pieces of art and Michael Bush shows you this.  If you don't want to read any trash books but would like to read a masterpiece about a friendship and trust between Michael Jackson and his dresser, read his one, the pictures are magnificant and the book great.
B001URCM44|5.0|Seeing the PBS concert on TV \\"Live At The Acropolis\\"..to being AT this concert while Yanni was on tour, PLUS savoring these memories(via CD & video) is comforting and priceless. Yanni's musicians are amazing and so much fun to see and hear.
B007B6VOG0|5.0|After hearing Fun on the radio, I had to listen to what else they had to offer, and I was not disappointed.
B0013D89YM|5.0|Went to the concert..heard all these songs..played this \\"album\\" over and over so many times(before & after the concert).  So much talent...this is definitely one of my favorites!
B004DI7HZ6|4.0|This book was suggested by someone in my book club.  It sounded interesting to all of us and it was selected.  I did not even know it was part of a trilogy until I could not put it down and was left hanging after the last chapter!  I read the second book within a few days.  Ms. Harkness better get that third book done soon, I can't wait.  It has already been picked up by Warner Bros for a movie.
B00000J2PH|5.0|this has the famous songs from the album back in the day.  some of the songs on this CD are i feel the earth move, you've got a friend and so far away.  and the sound is great.  a keeper.
B008MG1E4A|3.0|Too much preamble.  We have been bombarded with far too many Seal subject books and they are pretty much the same.  The raid on the Osama compound was highly detailed and interesting however.
B002QH2NUA|5.0|this bundle comes with a whole bunch of his famous songs through the years.  some of the songs on these CD's are jet, back in the USSR and something.  plus many other great songs.
B000TU16GS|4.0|I acutally bought this book for my 8 year old grandson.  We would read him one or two chapters at bedtime and he always tried to get us to read more or would read himself.  I thought the book was very well written and he enjoyed it very much.  I would definately recommend it.
B001JRB16U|5.0|based off the British novel.  full of magic and adventure.  this movie was like Julie Andrews first movie.  great for kids.
B007GCY8FS|5.0|I love the Jack Reacher character because he is strong, fearless and entertaining.  He lives by his own set of morals and good sense.  He is fully engaged in the world around him, but completely free from the usual ties that bind.  Great reading for any adult, but especially one who longs to break free from the daily grind without being burdened with sensitive, graphic, or controversial material.
B007SSEBCU|3.0|This Movie was ok, but not great.  The Actors all did a really great job portraying the characters within the script.  However, that is about the most positive thing I can say.<br /><br />It is my suspension that this was meant to be a movie about a strong woman, and her struggles to have her voice be heard in the male centered world around her.  While I believe that was the point the creators were trying to make I think unfortunately what they ended up showing was a over barring over reaching person, who now at the end of their life was left with nothing, but regrets and sadness.<br /><br />Whether the viewer agrees with Margret Thatcher's policies or not, the creator, if they wanted to make her a sympathetic character needed to believe in her polices and unfortunately what the movie portrayed was that they did not, and what you are end up with is a protagonist that you can feel sorry for because as the creators feel at the end of her life she is a failed sad person, but not one you can sympathize with because I don't think anyone dreams of ending up a failed sad person.<br /><br />Over all this is not a bad movie to watch, but if you are looking for something that is more historical and less sad, this might be one you want to skip.
B008Z9YLV2|4.0|Interesting movie but a little dissappointing from all the hype. The actors and characters of the movie were well played.
0307269752|4.0|Like many reviewers have mentioned, the first few chapters are rather slow, and I was wondering why some people are so crazy about the trilogy. However, after 3 chapters I think, the story started to get really intense, and literally I was hooked. I ordered the 2nd and the 3rd book when I was only half way through the 1st, that's how addictive this story is. I'd definitively recommend this book to someone who likes mysteries and social issues. If you like CSI, Law & Order: SVU, Without A Trace, I guarantee you'll like this book, too! I just got my 2nd book, can't wait to start!
B005LLSNNE|5.0|SOA is one of those shows that I started watching because I was sick. Now I can't stand to miss it. If you like real life dramas with lots of action and so many twist and turns you feel like you are on a roller coaster then watch this show.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|I wasn't sure at first, since i didn't particularly liked Bared to you, but i most say she came back with such an amazing story, it made me laugh and cry, i loved IT.
B004ZRV3AU|5.0|When I started doing some research on how to cut wine bottles I started to get nervous because many reviews on products said how difficult it can be and documented other people's low success rate. Naturally this made me extra cautious. The reviews for this product were better than any other I saw and it was also one of the cheapest. (How convenient!) The first time I tried the cutter on a wine bottle I was super careful to follow all directions. The directions were by no means difficult to follow and it ended up working beautifully. I'll be using this product to create the rest of the centerpieces for my wedding and I could not be more pleased with the results!
B0094BB4TW|2.0|This app worked great for about a month, but now it locks out after about ten posts.  Needs a fix!!
B001KVZ6HK|4.0|Great movie. Good deal. Great extras. Only thing was that the blu ray case was not built for 4 movies. Should have been a fold out case, not just put them on top of each other. But other than that... The quality.... Great
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|The book was great it brought both the demigods of both the Greek and Roman gods together to start to form a team that will have to save the planet from Gaea and her nasty children.  The way they brought in past heroes and portrayed them as being flawed like Hercules and bringing in Arachnea were interesting.  I would recommend this book and can hardly wait for the next one to come out next fall, it will be a hard wait but maybe Rick Riordan will bring out another of his Kane Chronicles books in the mean it that has to do with the Egyptian Pharoahs that have seen the goings on in New York in one of the earlier Percy Jackson books.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|you do not have to be a young adult to enjoy these books we read them out loud to the children and everyone begs for just one more chapter. a wonderful way to enjoy family time without t.v.

B009CPJHY4|3.0|I was excited to watch the movie 1. all the fantastic actors 2. I loved the book. The acting and movie itself was very good.  If I hadn't had read the book I would have given the movie 4 stars - but - since I read the book I was disappointed in the movie. The movie changed so many things and wasn't nearly as personal or gripping. The book pulls you into the story.....the movie leaves you feeling as if your watching from the outside. The book had you feeling as if you knew each person and how their lives all came to be connected....the movie just throws them together - and then the changes that were made just took away from the story. Watch the movie to see a decent film, but read the book to really experience The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel. The book is much better.
B0070NSPCU|5.0|There are very few books in this price range which are worth a five star review and this is one of them. I love boy's tales of growing up, epic adventure, unusal but human environments, evil, conflict, spirtual insight, romance, comradeship of young boys and the learning of life's lessons. This book is along the lines of Orson Scott Card's Enders Game - yes that good.  This is an epic book which is quite long for this class and worth every bit of your time.<br /><br />I too wonder where this author came from for out of the blue has created a minor classic.
B007SGLZP8|2.0|None of the thrills, wit, or suspense I associate with Grisham at his best. A workmanlike effort--respectable but not enjoyable. Implausible, one-dimensional characters; no legal fireworks. Just blah. I do not feel I got my $13 worth of entertainment. (And i agree with the Amazon reviewer who said the New York Times review made no sense.)
B005LAIHXQ|4.0|OK, good flick, great special effects and the aliens have been refined to an art.  But I was expecting a better story, one more paced and perhaps more original--this one leaped forward to a succession of familiar story lines, almost to a more elaborate rhyme/repeat of the original Alien.  Grand celestial stores that come to revolve around us diminish rather than elevate ultimate questions.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|I've been a Stephen King fan since I read the original version of The Stand more than 30 years ago. Being old enough to remember where I was on 11/22/63, the concept behind this story drew me in.<br /><br />King always seems to give just the right amount of detail to paint a vivid image of the his stories' settings. Plus, I love time-travel stories.<br /><br />(Spoiler alert) The concept of a reset was new to me. I could see alternative outcomes and would love to see king produce a second book with a different outcome.
B007GCY8FS|4.0|Lee Child and his protagonist Jack Reacher have never disappointed me before and Wanted Man continues to provide the best in crime solving at the highest levels.  The supporting cast of characters in this book are interlaced into the plot to keep the readers guessing and on pins and needles for the whole read.  I don't even need to read a synopsis anymore if it is a Jack Reacher story by Lee Child it becomes an immediate download. On a side note this is the first book I ever ordered in advance of its release date, ergo, paid top price not something this frugal man does frequently!
B000QQFKYE|3.0|I knew what I was buying: I read the other reviews, I read all Rotten Tomatoes reviews and I took the risk. Ok it is a David Lynch movie. It has a perfect performance by Laura Dern...Jeremy Irons is there...all is weird...but what's wrong? or am I wrong? yeah maybe I am wrong, I forgot Lynch has all those meta languages. Well If I want to get entertained this is crap, but I just have to be trapped by David' world...so I will give it another try. In the meantime I have to be honest: It didn't satisfy me ad Mulholland Drive or Blue Velvet ,or Wild at Heart, or ok Twin Peaks.This one is really heavy, but I think the trick is to try it at small doses. Good luck!

B009WJWMNI|4.0|Ok, you all know that citan does not play it safe with his reviews.  He just goes out there and gives his opinion to anyone who may be interested.  So, I will just come out and boldly predict that this show will make it.  And it will get a second season.<br /><br />Straight as an arrow is how I would describe the plot.  Young man comes back from an isolated island, wiser and more mature than when he first got there.  Not only that, he has learned some pretty extreme survival skills.  He comes back to his city, vowing to set old wrongs to rights.  He systematically tracks down the predators who continue to victimize the weak and the poor.  Throw along a whole lot of drama brought on by a dysfunctional family, obscene wealth, and some intriguing mystery to add to the spice.  And what you have here is a show that might fill the vacuum left behind by Smallville.<br /><br />Stephen Amell plays the role of Oliver Queen, the Arrow.  Formerly a playboy who has failed at everything he has ever done right up until he gets shipwrecked off the coast of a mysterious island.  Paul Blackthorne is the policeman who wants to track down the Arrow.  Both play their parts very well.  Amell's hooded archer is certainly a different personality from the one played by Justin Hartley.  Amell's Oliver Queen comes across as a brooding, moody, and abrasive person.<br /><br />Surrounded by his manipulative mother, bratty little sister, and ambitious step-father, Oliver sacrifices his public image in order to hide his true identity.  Going out of his way to appear like the same immature playboy that got shipwrecked five years ago has costed him the respect of the people around him.  Methodically and systematically tracking down the bad guys on his father's list, he catches the attention of Detective Lance.  Lance sees the Arrow as some uncontrolled vigilante who needs to be apprehended.  To make his identity changing activities more challenging, Oliver is shadowed by a personal bodyguard, John Diggle, assigned to him by his mother.  At this point, we do not yet know where Diggle's loyalties are.  Nor do we know exactly what happened to Oliver on that pacific island.  For the moment, Diggle and Tommy form Oliver's entourage.  Neither of the two know of his night-time, covert activities.  Whose side will they take when do eventually find out?<br /><br />In any case, this show is good.  I suspect it will hang around for quite some time.iggle, assigned to him by his mother.  At this point, we do not yet know where Diggle's loyalties are.

And watch Jensen Ackles sing \\"All out of love.\\" Classic!

B001P3SA94|5.0|I LOVE THIS MOVIE!  Jeffrey Wright is one of the best actors of this generation.  His ability to metamorph into each character he portrays is always believable and refreshing.  Immediately, you understand the complexities of Muddy Waters and his passion for the blues.  Beyonce also delivers a believable performance, transforming into the broken young Etta James.  This is one of those movies that can be quoted for ages from Beyonce's line, \\"You bettin' a thousand on being wrong\\" to Wright's, \\"You ain't hungry, but you ain't ate!\\"  Newcomer Chyna Layne should be looked out for in upcoming films and Columbus Short and Eamonn Walker offer the greatest character polarity.

B0098VXE50|5.0|We got i the movie in good condition and have watched it three times. We will be watching it alot i am sure. kristen Syewart and Charlize Theron are great in this movie. they made a good choice in their casting.
B007IXWL2C|3.0|I read all the books, and it seems to me that their encounters were too many to be believed. Although the author was able to keep the reader searching for an answer to the madness. In reality I felt you would have to be a super human from outer space to keep up with all those encounters. It was a good story in the sense that it kept the reader wanting to know what the main character was really about. I would have liked it better if more was said about the main character in reference to his past and the real reasons that justify all the madness.  As for the second character, It was hard to accept that an intelligent young woman like her could be that nieve. I felt let down I expected more.
B006LSZECO|5.0|I liked the many twists and turns. I especially liked the two different points of view.  One of the best novels that I have read in a long time. Married Man of 45 years who many times has underestimated his wife.
B00913P6G0|5.0|As a 22 year old, I love music. As a quote I once read, \\"music is what feelings sound like\\" so I turn to music to help me through life. Now if you look through my ipod, you'll find mostly all rap, from horrorcore [Tyler, the Creator] gangsta rap [50 Cent] to backpack rap [Drake] and conscious rap [Talib Kweli] and when it comes to Kendrick Lamar, i personally would list him as a gangsta/conscious rapper. I first got into Kendrick Lamar after finding out he got signed to Aftermath records, I'm a huge Shady/Aftermath/G-Unit fan, so anyone signed to any of these labels I listen to and love.<br /><br />Kendrick Lamar is a great addition to the roster of Aftermath. If you haven't heard Section.80 you seriously don't know what you are missing. He is an amazing story teller. Now to review the album<br /><br />Pros.<br />1: guest spots are very limited, as his first label album, I think this is an impressive act. Most new rappers need big name features in order to sell.<br />2: the production for this album is amazing, very well selected<br />3: the skits at the end of each song help tell the story of the whole album, and I like that they didn't make them individual tracks.<br />Cons.<br />1: just 1 TDE artist is featured on this album, this is complete none sense, where's ScHoolboy Q? Ab Soul?<br />2: Kendrick got more mainstream attention when Lady Gaga tweeted a verse from one of his song, then news hit that they did a song together, but Kendrick left it out, cuz it didn't fit the concept of the album.... I absolutely love \\"The Recipe\\" but it def doesn't fit the album, so I def think they should have put it in as a bonus track or deluxe edition<br />3: he sometimes does the accent thing too much, to the point that he sounds different each song. I loved Relapse, but I can also acknowledge that Eminem overdid the accent thing.<br /><br />Overall I think this CD is a new classic. I was going to review each song individually, I seriously suggest listening to the album, because reading and rating each song for this album isn't about reading it on my review, its all about listening to each track to go through the story of a good kid in a mA.A.d city.
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|Wow!!!!!!!! I was really impressed with the graphics and story line. the hidden objects were not too hard to find. All and all this game did make you think and at times challenging and a little scarey. Thanks Big Fish. Cant wait for the next part.
B009K0OTVM|2.0|I'm always disappointed when a TV show starts out with a fantastic first season and then fizzles in the second.  It's almost like all of the creative energy was used up making the first season and then there's nothing left.  Or maybe they just ran out of things to say.  Either way it looks like it's happening with Revenge and I'm pretty bummed.  Looks like I have to find a new favorite show.
0425263916|5.0|Finish this book in one day. It was that good. If you liked Bared to You, you will love this book. It picks up right where the first one ended. There are a lot of twists and turns that you wont be expecting. I feel there is more story in this book and less of the sexual stuff than the prior book - which I think is a good thing. Buy this book. Read it. Enjoy it.
B0000029J5|5.0|I recently bought this CD on Amazon and have listened to it many times now. Keb Mo has a truly unique voice and sound. This album is fast becoming on of my favorites!  Thank you Amazon for the great product and speedy service. I highly recommend Keb Mo and Amazon.com!!!
B002XUBDZ6|5.0|When this movie came out i was a little boy in the USSR. And \\"cable\\" bootleg movies were shown on TV and baddly dubbed. I remeber seeing this movie and i thought it was great. When i came to the states I saw on TV in english and now that it wasn't some bootleg copy it was even better. Now when I see this movie 20 years later its still as good as it was. In all reality I think this was one of the best Schwarznegger dlicks of all time.
B009GEBBNQ|5.0|My husband and I really enjoy this movie as much as our son.  It is so well done and fun to watch.  I wouldn't recommend to younger children, some scary images and four-letter words.
B007PT3QOQ|3.0|i loved this game up until it started giving you goals that you had to spend real cash on. yeah you could get it when digging for gold but whos to say howlong thats gonna take. so frustrated. other than taht is fun but soo  the joy runs out
B009VB97EY|5.0|If you expected sexy, hard-bodied actors ripping their velcro pants off, then you came to the right place. However, if you expected Channing Tatum to show how much he has grown as an actor and Matthew McConaughey in one of his better roles, then you also came to the right place. This movie is carried by Tatum in a role loosely based on his early career as a stripper. But the movie is not just about strippers, it's about a young man doing what he has to do to get by while working toward a dream of owning his own business. He deals with women not taking him seriously as anything other than a pretty face, the seedier side of the club industry, and the pains of never feeling like he's going to realize his dream. Don't get me wrong, the stripping scenes totally pay off and are downright hilarious, but the movie is so much more. There are even scenes for the men who are being dragged by their women to see this movie. Give it a chance, it's worth your time.
B00006I8TW|1.0|It was not the product I ordered (Remember The Titans CD Soundtrack). The outside cover was Remember the Titans but inside was a lullaby CD.  It was a used CD for $4.99.....I thought that was a dirty trick.  The seller's name was Fred Smith... No contact information.  Extremely disappointing.
B005LAIHRC|1.0|I am just forced to write this review because I was actually excited about this movie when it came out.<br />I have to admit I do like musicals when they deal with musical subjects.  For instance: I hate the Les miserables (musical) because... C'mon... who the hell sings his or her heart out in the middle of a firefight? it just looks ridiculous!<br />On the other hand... A cynical piece full of sexy singing women like Chicago... what is not to like?<br />I thought Rock of Ages was going to be something similar sexy chicks singing 80s glam hits... After all... look at the posters!<br />I WAS TERRIBLY, TERRIBLY MISTAKEN<br />Yes, there are three beutiful sexy girls in the ensamble cast, but they sing the worst tunes of the 80s, the script for the movie is just... just lazy and the acting is... somehow (i really do not know how) worst!<br />Naive girl comes to the city with rock dreams in her head during the glam california era, she gets to work in the hottest club in town and meets a \\"rock god\\" that spawned from that particular club while romancing another employee of the club who is, obviously, also a talented underapreciated aspiring \\"rock god\\"... Enter the cruel evil manager that tries to manipulate them all and... well you can fill in the blanks without even watching.<br />It is expected for the plot to be lame, but I sincerly thought this was a love piece for the  Montley Crues and Poisons and (dare I say it?) Warrants of the time... Instead we are stuck with... Journey?????? Ok, maybe I was to young to remember the 80s properly but Steve Perry dont come to mind when I think about the glam rockers of the time.  I know this is a brodway musical and probably the music selection came from there but... C'mon... They could have changed it to actually be relatable to... I don't know... Rock fans? After all this was supposed to be a blockbuster with a ginormous budget!<br /><br />Malin Ackerman licking the ear of an obviously dwarf and esterodical Tom Cruise?<br /><br/>Just not my cup of bourbon (and that is probably the best scene of the movie)
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|Very good movie. Enjoyed the hole show. Have watch it several times, and have add it to my computer copy, so I can watch it will play on the computer.
B007MDB548|5.0|My Granddaughters just watched this and LOVED it! As Grandma, I like to send them the new animated movies as they become available. Some of them miss the mark. This one was a big hit!
B004VMUS9G|5.0|The number of settings are huge: I can change the noise and tone I wake up to from a vast number of options,  change the theme, give the alarm a long title to name, set the volume to gradually grow louder, set many alarms, and more, but I would have to say that the option to require math problems in order to sneeze or hit snore is deffinately a favorite of mine. All that, and the alarm is free?  DEFFINATELY worth it. :-)
B005Z28M58|5.0|It worked great. No glitches and didn't scratch. I love this show and am sad it came to an end.
B004VMUS9G|4.0|Very reliable alarm clock. Does not wake up my Kindle Fire like it claims it should. Would recommend it to others.
B006T3RM08|4.0|I have a Mac Mini attached to a tv in my basement.  I needed to be able to control it from the couch or my lap, and this item works like a charm for that.  I have the Apple wireless keyboard and Magic Trackpad in this and it makes them one solid unit.  I did turn on tap to click for the trackpad, as it can be a bit hit or miss to actually click it when it is not supported on the bottom, but I have been very happy with my purchase so far.
0307454568|5.0|I saw the movie 'The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo' and was troubled by the bestiality displayed within it. However, the Author did, apparently, witness such in his younger days and wanted it exposed. This novel is not a fast moving suspense like the `Dragon'. It is a slow, a very detailed tale (almost as if the writer needed to fill the pages, at times), obviously written by a journalist. And, although a somewhat uneventful story, especially in the first seven chapters, despite the various killings and the heroine's use of an axe on her degenerate Russian father's face, it is a very good narrative. Definitely not as strikingly `thrillerish' as the other two in the same trilogy. I liked it very much and would recommend it to all serious readers. The writer was a great narrator, no doubt about it.<br /><br />Steven Nedelton<br />Author of Fear!

B007RP4D5Y|5.0|After seeing the Unity Band perform at Yoshi's Jazz Club in San Francisco I knew that I needed to own the cd.  Everything about the cd is 5 stars. All of the musicians are top notch. I loved it when they had solos that were very \\"outside\\" the normal melody.  I play 2 particular selections of this cd to get me going if I'm feeling down. It really picks me up and changes my mood.<br />I've been listening to and buying Pat Metheny's music for almost 30 years. I am a truly devoted fan. I hope others enjoy this cd as much as I do.
B005EGXTL2|4.0|I enjoyed this story and I think all three books need to be read in order.  I was advised that it was a teen book but found it enjoyable, and easy to read at bed time.

B0052RDHTM|5.0|Ken Follett, as usual, delivers good fiction.  He is a master story teller and keeps the reader wanting more.  I look forward to reading the next book in his trilogy.

B007OWRBJK|2.0|Some parts interesting but on the whole a pretty boring review of the 60's rock world! He is pretty selfish and self indulgent.
0451232852|5.0|\\"Fall of Giants\\" is a great historical saga of the World War I era. Similiar to the very popular PBS Series \\"Downton Abbey\\" only much better. Few authors have the talent to make a historical novel such a page turner but Follett definitely does; he's my favorite author and I rate this as one of his best. I admire his research and historical accuracy. I'm about to begin the Part II, \\"Winter of the World\\" and really looking forward to the enjoyment of relaxing with it. If you like it try my [[ASIN:B004H8G41A Horseshoes & Nuclear Weapons (Attacks on America the Mike Hatch Terrorism Series)]] and [[ASIN:0965722511 Take It to the Limit]]

B00984668E|5.0|From the opening riffs of Veil of Isis to the ZZ Top cover of Cheap Sunglasses this album is spectacular. I own Gods Of The Earth and Warp Riders and this isn't the same band. This album is so above and beyond their previous work. You could almost close your eyes and think its 1975 and Ozzy can really sing. They have way more going than Sabbath though. This is such a riff heavy album and the band deliver on every song. The opener, Eyes of The Stormwitch, and Apocryphon are excellent, but really this whole album is top notch. If you question their influences, check out the Cheap Sunglasses cover. Don't let this be the only Sword album you buy, their whole catalog is worth owning, this just happens to be the best of their catalog. Love these guys. Buy this album, you won't be disappointed!!
B00913P6G0|5.0|FInally got my hands on this Deluxe album and it's got some good tracks and some normal ones along the way....<br />First of all, The Art of Peer Pressure is one of my favorite tracks but not on the album, reason being, it sounds speed-ed up in some way from the leak online but that's just my opinion.<br />I don't usually buy cds again but this one HAD to make it in my collection.

1609611543|5.0|I believe the Wheat Belly book, and I've finally decided to try to follow this program. So far, I'm in withdrawal, just as the book stated. Today is easier than yesterday. I will revise this review as my progress with this revolutionary idea continues.<br /><br />One week later:<br />I am adding to this review as I continue to test the program on a personal level. So far after a week, I haven't lost any weight, but my digestive system feels one hundred percent better. The motility of IBS had become intolerable.<br /><br />Also it isn't really difficult to resist wheat products, even in restaurants. A little planning makes it possible. Of course, cooks sneak things in, but only the true celiacs need to worry about this aspect of their food.<br /><br />This book makes sense. It explains in a convincing way much of what is going on in our diets at this stage of history. It's encouraging to think there may be a simple fix for some of our health problems.
B00910Y1OQ|4.0|got it as the free app and haven't been able to put it down yet.  the best feature is the changing layouts
B005S9EJ14|5.0|I thought this movie was excellent -- I am a fan of Judy Dench.  I thought she and all the other stars gave  excellent performances.
0071752854|5.0|If you are trying to present, persuade, and win a deal - any deal (be it a multi-million dollar business, or a new job), then this is a must-read book. Oren clearly outlines his method of pitching, appropriately called STRONG: S - Setting the Frame, T - Telling the Story, R - Revealing the Intrigue, O - Offering the Prize, N - Nailing the Hookpoint, G - Getting a Decision. After you read the book, you'll start thinking of your day-to-day interactions in terms of the STRONG framework whenever you are trying to persuade anyone of your opinions. In addition to outlining the method, Oren clearly and succinctly presents the mechanics, the psychological reasons, of why this method works. Overall, I would urge you to buy and read the book.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|It was great.....I loved it ....best book that i have read in a while i would recommend it to anyone!!!!

0316286850|4.0|I bought it because one good photofrapher recommended it.<br />I don't regret doing it, 'cause for me as a makeup amateur and photographer it is useful.<br />But I am disappointed by the poor quality of the majority of the photos.

B0058YPL66|5.0|I couldn't watch this series on free to air tv because of clashes with other shows and was ticked off at the channel airing it because the time was ALWAYS WAY OFF so it never recorded properly and so as soon as it was available for pre-order I grabbed it.  Then I had to wait impatiently for it to be released - luckily it wasn't that long a wait and even better was between it being sent from the US to me in Australia - it was, thankfully very quick!!!<br />Of course I starting watching as soon as I got the packaging off (was in perfect condition due to great packaging - thanks again - and of course couldn't  stop watching!!<br />Loved this show and will definitely be grabbing season 2 on DVD to get the extras and so I can watch without ad interruptions every 5 minutes plus the fact that tv actually cut the show to fit more ads in so viewers end up missing bits here and there!!! DVD/Blu-Ray doesn't have anything missing and you get the extras PLUS through Amazon, even posted to Australia, is CHEAPER than anywhere else!!!<br />Another GR8 series that I'll be hanging out for each season to be released on DVD/Blu-Ray!!!

B00933U1EU|5.0|Have been a huge fan of Damien Lewis since I watched him in the Life series I discovered on Netflix. Was interested in the show because of Damien, but was pleasantly surprised to find excellent drama set in current political times. I enjoy the intelligence and the suspense. This show is addictive. Can't wait for Amazon to get season 2. Well worth the wait. I would recommend this show to anyone who enjoys good suspense, real life drama, and covert plots. This show is for the discerning and intelligent watcher who enjoys following the intricacies of a political thriller.
B0074D3CAQ|2.0|Not very good and I found it rather sad.  I bought this and read it for book club, it was suppose to be a 5 star book.  Not in my opinion.

B007IXWL2C|5.0|There is not one thing that I didnt like about this book. It has helped to improve my sex drive to a degree. I will be reading the series again. I loved all 3 books. I would recommend this book to everyone. Doctors should be recommending this series to people with low sex drive and low lobidos instead of pills.
B005IQZB14|4.0|Cheryl Strayed sets out on the PCT alone, with zero hiking experience, with hardly any preparation, and no idea how hard it's going to be.<br /><br />I thought the writing was pretty good, and it was a really quick read for me.  However, it's amazing that she survived the hike.  I found her complete lack of preparation or understanding of long distance backpacking mind boggling at times.  Granted, she was dealing with a lot at that time in her life, but seriously.  For example, Cheryl purchases hiking boots, but doesn't actually try to hike in them until she's on the PCT!  I didn't really feel sorry that she lost toenails...<br /><br />Apart from the crazy lack of logistical hiking understanding, the writing is interesting, and she weaves her life's past episodes into the story of her hike nicely.  I thought she painted pretty vivid pictures of the people in her life and how she ended up deciding to hike the PCT trail by herself.  Some of the writing is strongly worded and/or uncomfortable, so fair warning.  But a lot of life is uncomfortable, and the writing rings true to who she was at the time.<br /><br />I would recommend this to others.  If nothing else, it's thought provoking.
B009NQKPUW|3.0|The story would have been better is they had elaborated more on the aliens and not the humans....I was a little disapointed.

1439156816|5.0|I've never read a single Stephen King novel (almost impossible, I know), as his topics and his style are just not \\"my\\" \\"type\\" of lit. However, having seen this particular book highly recommended in several diverse places, I borrowed a friend's copy. Besides, even if King's \\"his\\" was not \\"mine,\\" it's certainly true that King's is \\"most's\\" if only by evidence of the fact that he's made a gajillion dollars with his words.<br /><br />I almost put the book down after the first twenty pages because there was nothing about writing at all, just a memoir, and I didn't particularly care at all for another \\"how I made it big\\" life-story. Luckily, I flipped forward and found that the book was divided into two parts and it was from the second section that I began to read.<br /><br />King writes very comfortably and directly in his advice and I was surprised to find such a friendly disposition to him. His main point that he stresses throughout is that a writer needs to read and write (as opposed to Hemingway's advice that all one needs to be a writer is to SAY he's a writer). Sounds simple enough, I know, but King pushes that message along convincingly and without hubris. Read and Write. No matter the genre. Read and Write. And along the way, he dispells with the so often heard advice of \\"write what you know.\\" How can you KNOW anything about an alien spacecraft? Write what you WANT and then fix the holes in your rewrite. King puts forth his opinion that good stories are not created, they are found, like a relic, and dug up. It's in the digging that decides what condition the treasure is unearthed.<br /><br />The added bonus to the book is his description of the horrific accident that nearly killed him. In this case, King IS writing what he knows and it's very touching. And though I've never read a novel of his, the incident seems worthy of the movies I've seen that were created from his books.<br /><br />Leaving aside the first half of the book and all the descriptiveness of the obese baby-sitter who used to sit on his head and fart, five stars. I may even go out and read one of his books now.obese baby-sitter who used to sit on his head and fart, five stars. I may even go out and read one of his books now.
B001NHNG64|1.0|After :discovering: this author through his Playboy interview, I decided to read his entire works from the beginning.  After reading the first two, I decided to give it up.  He writes the same plot with the same actions, with the same culprits and the same outcome.  If you have read one, you've read them all.  I wonder what he has against the FBI?  And also, if his \\"hero\\" is so tough, why don'y his captors just shoot him in the head when they have the chance.  Who is he?  James Bond? Batman? Matt Dillon? John Wayne?  Hopalong Cassady?  Sherlock Holmes?  or maybe \\"Don Winslow of the Navy!\\"
B0094BB4TW|3.0|Once I downloaded this app it appeared to work fine, after a few hours when I opened it up I would get connection lost error, even though my phone showed 4 bars on 4G LTE.

B007THA4FI|3.0|I am a huge JK Rowling fan Harry Potter so when the Casual Vacancy came out, I immediately bought it. First, I would have to say that it was expensive for an ebook. $17.99 on kindle before it was released.<br /><br />The story line was not bad. I did like the ending. Redemption for some of the characters. The middle part of the book was pretty boring though. But you kind of have to slug through it. There were so many characters in this story, that the story line sometimes gets muddled.<br /><br />I was a little surprised with the ending. But like I mentioned earlier, that was one of the best parts of the book.<br /><br />btw, when I like a book, no matter how long, it usually takes me a day or 2 to finish. 3 at the most. It took me almost 3 weeks to finish this one, because like a mentioned earlier, the middle parts were pretty much uneventful. So I stopped reading it for a while and then just got back to finishing it yesterday!
B007VUA7VO|1.0|I thought this app was good but while it was installed on my Kindle, I started having problems with charging my battery.  Having installed several apps within the same time frame,  I was unsure first that an app was even the problem -- I thought something was wring with my Kindle.  Later out of frustration,  I uninstalled this app,  and now my battery charges and stays charged as it is supposed to.  I can't imagine why this would be the case,  but I absolutely cannot recommend this app.
B003YUU62U|4.0|These are great shoes.  Lightweight and cushioned with more a flat footbed which I like.  Unfortunately even the 13s were not big enough for me. The length was probably ok, but the width was too narrow so I had to send them back.

0385335989|3.0|Originally, Diana Gabaldon was writing a trilogy. However, after she finished Voyager, she knew she still had stories about Claire, Jamie, Brianna and Roger to tell. This is the book I had been waiting for. Through Dragonfly in Amber and Voyager I had wanted more information about Bree and Roger. Finally, in this book, they get to play a bigger role. In the beginning of the book Claire and Jamie have landed in America. They go to visit Jamie's Aunt Jocasta and eventually start their own settlement called Fraser's Ridge. In the 1970s, Bree has finally decided that she wants to find out what happens to her mother and her biological father. She enlists the help of Roger and finds out that they die in a fire in 1776. She decides to go back through the stones to warn them.<br /><br />I don't know what it is about these books. Every single one of them is absolutely enthralling for the first several hundred pages. Then I hit a bump, something happens that severely bothers me, and I get a negative impression of the book. And then I keep going and end up interested again and pick up the next book in the series. This has happened with three separate books now (not Dragonfly in Amber, I liked that one all the way through) and I end up feeling unsatisfied but eternally hopeful that I will like the next one more.<br /><br />In Drums of Autumn's case there is one major cause of my disappointment. Jamie just stops listening. I actually think he has never listened (for example, when he starts yelling at his sister in Outlander for being a whore when really she keeps trying to tell him she is happily married) but he drives me crazy in this book. He accuses Roger of things, he accuses Bree of things, he yells and throws fits and then, finally, the truth comes out and he looks like the bad guy for being so rash. I do understand, to a certain extent. Sometimes things appear one way and he makes a decision based on limited information. But sometimes he just doesn't give people the chance to explain. There is a chapter with Bree where he insults her terribly without letting her tell him the whole story and I just got so frustrated with him for not letting her get a word in edgewise.<br /><br />I think I continue reading these books because I really like Claire and Bree. I thought this one was mostly interesting. I liked the picture of early America with the hardy settlers that are about to form a great nation. I also really liked seeing Lord John again. You can tell Diana Gabaldon likes him because, not only does he have his own series, but he keeping reappearing in Jamie and Claire's novels too. But I just wish Jamie had been less frustrating. If he would have behaved better, this would have been my favorite book in the series. As it was, I am once again hoping the next book (A Fiery Cross) will be better.
0374214913|3.0|Your appreciation for Penumbra is greatly dependent on your expectations. If you're interested in a snappy, YA page-turner to knock back like a light beer then Penumbra fits in nicely. If instead you're expecting intrigue and the light of exploration, then it is neither mysterious nor remarkable. Welterweight spoilers below.<br /><br />The story is set primarily in modern fantasy San Francisco where stereotypes about the Bay Area roam freely. As a recent transplant to SF I smirked at fairly accurate renditions of the corner of Broadway and Grant--the narrated location of the eponymous 24-Hour Bookstore--and little details like the way SF's winding streets reveal the bay at every opportunity. Unfortunately, the setting erodes rapidly into a technofantasy wonderland with the characters sudden fascination with computerized 3D modeling and the subsequent entry and romantic advances of Googler and Data Viz enthusiast Kat Potente. From this point forward (the author's?) unbridled infatuation with technology sets the stage and we're exposed to a nerdy successful entrepreneur stereotype named Neel and a very light \\"cryptomystery\\" involving a shadowy, but ultimately somewhat friendly, cult.<br /><br />In the unraveling of the cults secrets we witness details that seem born of a light obsession with typography, \\"hacking\\", books, cryptography, and perhaps trans-humanism. The disaffection of the narrator-protagonist speeds along the second half of the book with little trouble. The might of Google is tested and a literarily clever homage to, I imagine, Tolkein-named-Craig-Moffat succeeds where the techno-divinity failed. If you think the moral here is already too obvious you may want to skip out the (literal) slide deck toward the end.<br /><br />The book is densely peppered with references to modern antiquities. This novel's message might be generalized, but its medium is sharply 2012 and risks feeling passe by March 2013, trendy nostalgic by 2014, and utterly ancient by 2015.I don't think I've ever read any other work of fiction that so brazenly lives in the present. That said, all the detail backfires by making the technology and cryptography, themselves foundational elements of the narrative arc, detailed, yet terribly unbelievable.<br /><br />But I'm being too harsh. Sloan's writing has a wonderful lightness to it and is filled with infectious optimism. I almost want to say that my criticisms derive from my failure to just relax, MST3000-style. I can't recommend it to anyone who wants to learn or be challenged, but we can read just for enjoyment, too. Which is it's own kind of thesis for the book.<br /><br />Tl;dr? Optimism like Sloan's is definitely fun, but without a little more depth it's sadly, forgettable.
0761171703|5.0|This book not only captures dance and art, but it is the perfect combination of art and everyday living.<br />It is an inspiring book, done with taste and beauty.  It showcases some of the worlds most established dancers, and really makes you think about life, creativity, and those who push their boundaries.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Very easy to start with and gets challenging as the level and board size increases.  This game is EASY to learn is addictive and provides just enough challenge without frustration (at least so far for me!).  Then again, I'm only at the 100th board (out of 150) in the \\"Free Flow\\" section.  My 11 year old daughter took to this game pretty fast too and enjoys it as much as I do.

B0091REZMW|4.0|Lots of fun if you like hidden object games with a plot. Keeps you interested.  Just don't like the whole energy thing.
B007IXWKUK|4.0|I loved this book, more than I thought I would. It has a plot and pounding details that keep you hooked and yearning to read more. I liked how the characters were developed and how every since plot has an actually story that goes beyond the typical \\"bang bang novel\\" I've read ever book so far and looking forward to the next... so come on already!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|My escape..I want a Christian and not in the biblical sense. I love a good read and this is definitely it !!!! If you didn't enjoy it, you're probably the boring person in the room that no one wants to talk to.
B007URVZJ6|5.0|This answered all my questions and allowed me to go from no book at all to a written manuscript, formatted for Kindle, and published for sale in just under 2 weeks! Thanks Amazon.
B002RI9O9G|5.0|The novel really engages the reader, the story being told could be anyone's. The Irish immigration is part of the plot as well as the familial bonds, the gender issues, and also the immigrants' lives in a cosmopolitan New York. Racism is portrayed and it is shown how the economy influenced people's attitudes regarding the 'black' market. Unmissable!
B008OTTRXU|1.0|I personally believe this CD was a complete waste of money. Call Me Maybe was the only decent song on it. It wasn't even worth the $6 I spent on it. All the songs sounded the same: shitty 80s pop.
B0022Q8CSC|5.0|If you love Italy and its traditions, you just can't miss this book. It's an amazing portrait of the deepest passions of the human soul, its fears, its greed, its desire to be both powerful and beloved. It's a story of loneliness and of respect, delightfully surrounded by sicilian good manners and rules. If you enjoyed the movie, you'll certainly adore this book, to get even closer to the passionate Corleone family!
140132634X|3.0|Published in 2012 by Hyperion Audio<br />Performed by Dan Stevens<br />Duration: 4 hours, 42 minutes.<br /><br />I am torn by this book. I liked the message (just live your life, enjoy the time you have, don't be a clock-watcher) but this short book felt like it was jammed full of padding.<br /><br />The book is about Dor, a man who lives at the beginning of civilization. He is happily married to his childhood sweetheart, has kids and is also the first man to measure time. He creates sundials, water clocks, measures the cycles of the moon and notices the days get longer and shorter as the year progresses. His childhood friend is the king and the creator of the Tower of Babel. His friend wants to harness this ability to measure time in some way to build his tower but Dor refuses. They are banished and eventually his wife dies from a disease. Dor returns to the tower and storms up the stairs just as God punishes the builders of the tower (sort of like it is described in Genesis). Dor is not killed. Instead he is placed in a cave and is forced to listen to the prayers and laments of everyone who wants more time, less time, to stop time, to reverse time, or whatever. Dor does not age even though time continues to move forward. He becomes the mythical figure  known as Father Time.<br /><br />Meanwhile, in the modern world, two people have their own issues with time. An elderly businessman who is dying from cancer wants more time. A high school girl is dealing with issues of bullying and divorced parents needs to slow things down so she can process them.<br /><br />Dor is finally released from his prison and told that he can finally die if he can help these two people from a future world that he can barely comprehend. He gets to use the tools of Father Time (controlling the speed of time) to help him accomplish this goal. Will he do it? Albom telegraphs that early on - of course. How will he do it? That's the question.<br /><br />Dan Stevens reads this book with a great deal of skill. His multiple female characters are well done. I teach high school and he catches the cadence and rhythm of high school-speak very well. Even better, he catches the pain and frustration of the elderly businessman's voice wonderfully. As he dies from kidney failure his voice gets weaker and more slurred in scene after scene.<br /><br />I give this book 3 stars. It is very slowly paced and is only saved by the tear-jerker moments at the end that felt intentionally manipulative.eal of skill. His multiple female characters are well done.

B007TBZ63Y|5.0|The book was great overall and Riordin did a great job bringing all the characters together.  I ESPECIALLY LOVED THE ENDING TO THIS BOOK.  It was a cliffhanger.  Literally.

B0091REZMW|4.0|easy to play on kindle fire.  played this game before on Pc but saw the app for free so I downloaded it.
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|Great film, great set. Can't use the 3D Blu-ray, but that's alright. It's worth getting for everything else. The thing that sold it for me was that it was the pre-sale guarantee for $20. I couldn't pass that up, even with the one disk I can't use.
B0060AY7A8|3.0|This story seemed to go by quickly, not an epic like Paradise, but expertly written of course. Morrison even inserts some hope in this novel. Song of Solomon remains my favourite of hers but she still blows me away.
B005KJJ4F8|5.0|Cinder is an updated version of Cinderella, but even knowing that, I could not put the book down.  We have the future world, cyborgs, mind manipulation, evil stepmother and sister (of course) handsome prince (Kai) and Cinder.  She is part cyborg with no memory before her cyborg operation.  So begins the saga of Cinder.  I was sucked in ...  wonderful characters, especially the cyborgs and supporting cast.  She is of course wronged and so her story is told, and it even surprises Cinder.  It's a good read for any age and I can't wait for the next installment to find out what Cinder does, where she goes and if Kai is safe.

B0085Z3AMW|3.0|This transfer was better than Halloween 4. The sound was better too. Still a hair below what I was hoping for as far as the transfer went. If you can pick it up on the cheap go for it... Still not as good as what Shout Factory did with Halloween 3.
B007FEFLTO|3.0|The boook is based on history and the history is accurate. Therefoe I give it 3 stars. There are far too many characters and events in the book to make ie enjoyable. Hence not 4 or 5 stars
B004CLYKLI|2.0|I don't understand how a book like this has become a best seller. There's no important content on it, except a story of a fanatic mother trying to drive a whole family mad with her obsession to make her two daughters the best ones at everything they do, and brag about them all the time. I feel sorry for them. Don't waste your time on reading it.
B0061PEAUY|4.0|Fantastic! I devoured this book in 2 days! Loved all the twists and turns, the sexual tension between the key players and I actually learned a few things about mining diamonds as well.
0525952926|5.0|There is a danger of social and political historical fiction like the Century Trilogy. People already have a connection to the events and a sloppy author can simply trade on that knowledge to hold a reader's interest without allowing the reader to uncover something new.Historical fiction is often centered outside the experiences of the reader. When [[ASIN:1451635621 Gone with the Wind, 75th Anniversary Edition]] hit the best sellers list in 1936, there were both living veterans of the Civil War and many children of those veterans. GWTW reinforced much of the moonlight and magnolias myth of the Ante-Bellum South to such an extent that those myths still resonate one hundred fifty years after the War.<br /><br />Fortunately Ken Follett is an uncommon author. Covering the period from the end of the War to End All Wars to the end of the second such war, most readers are close enough to those events. However, Follett lets readers uncover new perspectives on these events.<br /><br />Many have written about the rise of Fascism in Europe and but few demonstrated how close the British aristocracy came to embracing it themselves. It is one thing to write about the Holocaust on a grand scale and something else altogether to witness the forced evacuation of the ill and insane from Jewish hospitals on trucks bound for extermination camps. The stupidity of American isolationism, the cruelty of Stalinism, idealism of the expatriate fighters in Spain, gay soldiers,and the bravery of the French and German resistance are all subjects within the reach of Follett's pen.<br /><br />Sit back, settle in and enjoy this part of what will be considered, for a long time to come, a contemporary gem.
B007OWRBJK|5.0|Pete Townshend is one of the power players in the music scene from the 60's onward. This in depth revisiting of his past is told without hype and fantasy. I was surprised to read of such a creative person having incredible difficulty handling fame, fortune and family. A must read for hard core Who fans.
0525953728|4.0|This doesn't give away any huge secrets or anything, so you shouldn't expect that, but it does give an interesting, first hand perspective on the tactical, well executed, killing of terrorist Osama Bin Laden. Anyone interested in warfare, the military, and especially the branch of Navy Seals that executed this mission will enjoy this book.
B008673ZAQ|4.0|Not quite as good as Fifty but still a very good book   Looking forward to more Sylvia Day books and of course the next part of this one
0316228532|4.0|This is a well-written book with well-developed characters. However, if you are looking for a \\"feel good\\" book or want to be entertained, you may want to look elsewhere. The book didn't captivate me until the middle, at which point I couldn't put it down. Even so, there were too many characters and none of them are very likable. The book addresses an overwhelming amount of society's ills. In the village of Pagford, everyone is unbelievably messed up. There isn't one person who doesn't have a significant emotional or relationship problem. It was interesting to watch the characters unfold and to discover their secrets. There is a complex web of cause and effect, often created by the characters' misunderstandings of certain situations. I was compelled to keep reading, waiting for the inevitable train wreck. The book contains frequent use of the \\"f\\" word and some uncomfortably adult situations. It is an irreverent, sad, shocking, and at times, darkly humorous story. There is a glimmer of hope at the end, which adds a tiny bit of light to an otherwise dark story. It's worth reading; just don't expect Harry Potter.
0385344228|4.0|William Landay has given us an unusual twist to a murder mystery and courtroom drama.  Most of the book involves  Jacob's father, an ex-district attorney, being questioned before a grand jury by the person he mentored, so the dialogue is raw and personal.  He tells the story of how his son is accused of murder, forcing him out of his job and turning the whole family into pariahs in their closely knit community.  He absolutely refuses to believe his son could have murdered a classmate, while his wife begins to have doubts.  Jacob's response to his arrest is eerie, causing everyone but his father to think he might be the murderer.  I enjoyed this book.  It was hard to put down because I was eager to find out what might happen next.

0385535147|5.0|After reading the first ten or so, I quit reading John Grisham novels for some reason and hadn't read one in quite a while.  I'm happy to get back to him. This one kept me turning the pages unlike any book I'd read in quite a while. It dispelled any thoughts I might have had that Grisham had lost his edge. This is as good as any of them.<br /><br />He's experimented with different styles lately, but this one is the type he knows best: the legal thriller. As you go through you'll see things that remind  you of some of the others. I won't say which ones so as not spoil anything.<br /><br />And it reminded me of two famous stories he didn't write: Stephen King's \\"The Shawshank Redemption\\" and Scott Turow's first book, \\"Presumed Innocent\\". Grisham's use of the first person present tense, as Turow did there, maintains tension and allows the narrator to tell his story without tipping you which way it's headed as it takes some sharp and unpredictable turns, like a well-thrown knuckleball.<br /><br />That narrator is Malcolm Bannister. Black, in his mid-40s, he's a small-town Virginia lawyer now disbarred and serving a 10-year stretch in federal prison after getting caught up in a big Washington scandal in which he played a small and unwitting role. He's innocent, but his life is wrecked. His wife has divorced him and remarried. His son has a new dad. His friends have dropped him. He has no career and no money.<br /><br />What he's got is a lot of time to think about the system that put him there, how to get out, and what sort of life he might then lead, like King's main character in \\"Shawshank.\\" When a federal judge's murder becomes the nation's highest profile unsolved crime, Bannister steps forward to say he knows who the killer is, but won't reveal it without an ironclad deal for his freedom.<br /><br />And there the fun starts.<br /><br />Grisham does a reasonable job writing from inside a black character's head, easier nowadays that the lives of blacks and whites intersect more and differ less. I think he gets the tone right for a man educated enough to sometimes hang around white white-collar criminals in prison, and other times with blacks mostly in for crimes like drug trafficking.<br /><br />And as the story takes its twists and turns you enjoy the intricacy of it. Grisham doles out the  revelations sparingly to keep you guessing until the end. I enjoyed a lot of the minutiae, particularly about the Witness Protection Program, a familiar element in crime stories from \\"The Sopranos\\" to \\"Goodfellas\\" but rarely portrayed in this kind of detail.<br /><br />Because in most stories, it's the end. Here, it's just the beginning.rsect more and differ less.

B009KHDT0C|5.0|Great entertainment.  Anything Johnny Depp is in you will have fun watching.  For those unfamiliar with Dark Shadows, they have done a fine job of giving you the complete story line.  The humor is fantastic and always keeps you watching so you don't miss anything.  Highly recommend.
B000OZ0NXA|5.0|I bought this book for my husband, and he just loves these Jack Reacher books.  He says they are hard to put down to have to go do something else.  I've now started ordering all the Jack Reacher books for him, but he reads way too fast!!  :)
0307352145|2.0|The first chapters are promising. Introversion is not the same as being shy, anti-social nor solitude lover. Lots of arguments to show us that introversion/extroversion concept is just a creation of USA culture, and the comparison with Asian societies is quite interesting.<br /><br />Suddenly all this falls apart. The biggest flaw of the book is to try to tie together three concepts: quite-introversion-sensitivity. Generalizations are needed, stereotypes are introduced and the whole initial good intention is lost. Quite a shame for such a good research.
B004ZZS4CC|5.0|Jaycee Dugard was an amazing person.  How a person who had been forced to live for so many years as she had been and survive so beautifully is a miracle.  She must have had good influences in her very young life. Perhaps mercifully, she could not envision all the terrible things that would happen to her.  It was a day to day existence.  Even at such a young age, her children were a reason for her to overcome her problems. An inspiring story for young adult and older readers.<br /> I hope her story leads to much better oversight and inspection of persons and their living spaces so that such things never happen again.

B008GOAFBQ|1.0|It rocked. It rocked and rolled over. This one didn't go all the way. How many times can Kiss repackage the same 10 songs and resell them?  I'm sure it will come again. They remastered it in the 90's and twice in the 2000's (as a mini-lp SHM-CD and as a SHM-SACD @24/88. Once again as a digital download @24/96 from HDTracks - that is the one I'm reviewing) I think the truth hurts, the fun of a new kiss record is the packaging, The inserts, the posters, stickers. After all these years, Kiss maybe still cranking out albums, But name five singles written after 1977. You want the best, don't get screwed. Go for the original.
B007IXWL2C|2.0|I really didn't love any of the three books.  I read them because of all the hype, and that's just what it was -- hype.  I kept going after the first one thinking it HAD to get better, and guess what? It didn't...  I expected more.  More plot, more intrigue, maybe not more sex (there was plenty of that), but more interesting sex perhaps?  I'm not sure.  I don't regret reading them, but they definitely won't be read again.
B0083SBMBM|5.0|Has to be the best movie out this year. The casting was wonderful and the plot was excellent. This is a movie you will want to see over and over.

B00910Y1OQ|5.0|i would definitely recommend this game.  it was a fairly simple idea that was very well executed only complaint is the end is lacking
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I honestly liked the book. Some of the reviews talk about how it lacks depth or repeats, a lot, but honestly what do you expect? It is an erotic novel damn it. It isn't a piece of classic literature. So get your panties out of the twist they are in and just read the damn book. :)  It is a good sequel, and actually contains a story line. I like the new side of Mr. Grey, but I am extremely annoyed by the inner goddess metaphor. It seems very childish to me. I look forward to the conclusion of this strangely interesting book.
0345803485|1.0|I dont understand what is all the fuss about. This was one of the most boring books I have ever read. I didnt even finish reading it (I gave it a chance and read 70% but it didnt get better at all so i stopped). Summary:<br />Plot - boring, there is not much going on, the dialogs are irritating (every other sentence starts with \\"Holy Crap\\" or \\"Double Crap\\" or \\"Holy shit\\" which is annoying)<br />Characters - not developed, boring, especially the Ana character is really weird and I dont understand what kind of reader can identify with her<br />Sex scenes - not shocking at all, but rather boring, there is no anal, no threesome,  no squirting etc so I dont understand how can be anyone shocked about it.<br /><br />Some of the comments here say its written for teenagers but honestly if I had a teenage daughter I wouldnt let her read it, and its not because of the sex (which is vanilla btw!) but because of the gender stereotypes - naive/silly/inexperienced/clumsy girl falls for Prince Charming (rich,beautiful, powerful) and does everything to please him and her whole world spins around him and nothing else... Its 21th century, so get a different book.
B007PT3QOQ|3.0|I absolutely loved it but then IT happened! I was buying a fence for my farm part of my town and my fence is in the middle of the plain and a part of a lake was close by so.... then I moved it where I wanted it to go and it wasn't even that close to the lake and it turned red and said I couldn't put it there and it really made me mad because I want my fence there but it wont go! EEERRR!!! but other wise its a good game. PLEASE fix this glitch it will make me happy! :)
B00280LYIC|5.0|This was a very entertaining book.  I know it is supposed to be a younger person's book, but I could not help but love it.  It was refreshing to for me to read such an easy-to-read book.  I can't wait to start the next one.  I would suggest this book to young or old.  It is a great story and is a nice change of pace from more advanced novels.
1439152802|4.0|Such a beautifully well crafted story should be no secret. Put some time aside when you pick up this book because you will not want to put it down.<br /><br />Kate Morton has devised a way to make smooth transitions from 2011 to 1941 WWII by alternating chapters that intertwine & move along like warm melted butter.<br /><br />It is indeed a book about secrets, but as you burrow into the life of the richly drawn characters of Dorothy (Dolly), Vivien & Jimmy, you find a love story rife with misunderstanding; high-flung hopes & aspirations & imagined wrongs. All at a time when bombs are raining overhead & life takes on a whole other dimension. It is a mystery as well as a love story & you will, I can promise, be tempted to look at the ending before you are half way through the book. I urge you not to do so because the ending is so startling you will not want to spoil it for yourself.<br /><br />This is a compelling tale about love in the time of war & haunting secrets that linger, bits & pieces being picked up by adult children who inevitably need to know more & stop at nothing to find answers & the truth.<br /><br />Absolutely wonderfully written!!
B001NLKT60|5.0|What can I say that hasn't already been said about this book? The saga continues with Lisbeth Salander, as more is revealed about her life. She is once again paired with Mikael Blomkvist as they race against time to solve the murders of two journalists who were set to publish an expos&eacute; on the sex trafficking trade. Filled with page-turning action and suspense, this book had me reading well into the night to finish.
B007TK77QE|4.0|I love JK Rowling's New book the casual vacancy. it's not for the faint hearted though, there are some uncomfortable subjects in the book. Pagford's favorite citizen has died suddenly and the reader is then thrown into a voyeuristic type journey into the lives, loves and losses of some of its inhabitants. Some you will love. Some you will hate and of course the ones you love to hate. I think Jk Rowling has delivered a superb piece of writing yet again. Her sentence structure is fabulous. And she has an uncanny knack of knowing how human minds work. Don't read this if you want a fairy tale ending though! It ain't gonna happen.
B000001GX8|3.0|Some good stuff here, I guess. With gun held to head this 1968 recording lacks modern sound quality which would just fine if the overall performance wasn't so sluggish and the females could find a little more of their Angel inside.<br /><br />Struggled to find those heart-wrenching warm moments within the ladies' solos. Rene Jacobs' and Hungarian State Opera (Highlights) provide larger grins and jaw drops.<br /><br />I also prefer the \\"acting\\" of the other two versions mentioned. This recording seems processional, the players are trying to zip through their lines as quickly as possible, whereas in the Rene Jacobs' version the characters are so very engaged like they're standing in the room with you arguing and maneuvering. Tactile, emotional, invested, convincing. Kinda scares you at times.<br /><br />The Rene Jacobs version also sonically sounds out of this world especially on SACD.

B0090P98Z4|5.0|This game is fantastic. great hack n slash for the most part but the end game levels ie. hell 10 it takes strategy. yes you can do a in app purchase of Glu credits to get some of the best armorial and weapons in game but it really isn't needed. my Toon can keep up or out perform other toons with purchased items. my only complaint about this game for the kindle fire is the delay by amazon to release the updates. version 1.3.0 has been out for over 3 weeks and still not available threw Amazon's app store. step it up amazon I know your checking for bugs before you release it but 3 weeks is a little much.
B006OITIQE|5.0|My daughter loves loves loves this cd!  This is all she seems to listen to!  If your a One Direction fan I'm thinking you'll love it.
B0086700CM|4.0|this game may not ask you 20 questions,  but it is fun to play. Quick thinking is needed!  Love this game
0345803485|1.0|I agree with so many of the negative reviews on here that I barely have to write one myself... but I am going to anyway.  I have only read the first book and my perusal of this series will stop there.  I have read better \\"erotica\\" on free websites than this book, and like many others I agree that this is Twilight juxtaposed with some BDSM and even worse writing.  Below are my main criticisms of the book.<br /><br />1. Repetitive.  Repetitive.  Did I say, REPETITIVE?  Yup.  After all the lip biting, oh crap(ing), oh my(ing), and Ana's multiple orgasms from what most women consider barely any sexual stimulation, I got sick of it.  The first 20 oh craps weren't so bad since that seems to be the character's phrase of choice, but COME ON already!<br /><br />2. I have several friends in the BDSM world and it's clear that the writer doesn't have experience in this area.  Not knocking her for it, but most people (at least who I know personally) are involved in a healthy relationship and their significant other(s) may or may not participate with them in the BDSM lifestyle.  I hate the fact that some women have read this book and all of a sudden want their own \\"Christian Grey.\\"  I think every woman has some desire to be dominated, some more than others, but this book kind of takes it to the extreme.  You mean you want to be controlled by some rich possessive dude who wants nothing to do with you other than to make you his sex slave?  Oh, and let's not forget he flips out about people in your life after barely knowing you for a week and shows up at random in your bedroom.  No thanks.  That's not sexy, it's psychotic.  Twilight, anyone?  Same thing there.<br /><br />3. I really hate and took issue with the fact that we don't know what Ana's body (or face) really looks like.  She referred to herself as too skinny at one (of many) self conscious points in the book but other than brown hair and blue eyes... what does she look like?!!! We read plenty about Christian's body but don't even know what bra size she wears.  Perhaps that isn't important to most people but usually in this kind of a novel the details matter, and I didn't connect with her character at all other than thinking she's naive.<br /><br />4. I know this book isn't supposed to be realistic (just like Twilight wasn't, hello sparkly vampires and Native American werewolves) but a book like this will give some readers the wrong impression about a certain lifestyle that actually DOES exist in reality.  As I said before, BDSM does exist and I didn't like the way it was portrayed here.  Perhaps I am nitpicky, but as a consumer I suppose that's my right :-)<br /><br />I could go on and on.  I hated Twilight for the same reason I hate this book, and the fact that it actually manages to give people unrealistic expectations about their love lives just drives it all home for me.  Though that's mostly on the part of said readers, not the author.  Twilight was a trend the same as this book has become one, and if I hadn't received it as a gift I never would have read it.
B00005JKHP|5.0|The first thing you'll notice is the properly adjusted soundtrack. You can easily hear all the scenes clearly now. The creative, additional special effects are subtle and don't interupt the movie. Instead, they enhance the story. There are some appropriate edits that keep the story moving. The annoying, speaking alerts are replaced with more subtle ones. Finally, the epic intro of the Enterprise is retained. If you like Star Trek, this movie is a must-see.
B001TMCF3S|1.0|This review is for the Kindle edition of \\"The Complete Novels, Jane Austen (Author), Karen Joy Fowler (Introduction). Penguin Classics Deluxe Edition. ASIN: B001TMCF3S\\".<br /><br />I have a paper copy of this book (or rather another Penguin edition of it ISBN: 978-0141030173), but it's a bit bulky, so I bought the Kindle version of this book today. Only in a few minutes of browsing I found a couple of typos - a full-stop instead of space between words in the same sentence, a semi-colon where there should be a comma. Therefore I have returned it.<br /><br />I have also notified Amazon about these (using the `Report Content Error' menu on Kindle); so perhaps these particular ones will be quickly fixed. But, I am sure, there will be others.<br /><br />I verified all these errors against the paper copy, especially the 'semi-colon in place of comma' error because it is somewhat hard to be sure about this specific one in a Jane Austen text as in some places she does make use of a good number of semi-colons to construct long sentences; and I think it is a literary artifact she consciously employs to convey the meaning in a particular way or set a certain pace for a stream of thought, etc. Hence it is very important that her text be of high quality.<br /><br />Here's the semi-colon error. Note the semi-colon after 'fancy'. This is somewhere towards the end of Chapter 9 of Pride & Prejudice.<br /><br />  \\"And so ended his affection,\\" said Elizabeth impatiently. \\"There has been many a one, I fancy; overcome in the same way. I wonder who first discovered the efficacy of poetry in driving away love!\\"<br /><br />A previous reviewer (Cynthia L. Gause, October 24, 2012) has also reported spelling mistakes. She is right about there being 'riot' in the text, where it should be 'not' - (\\" ... but I am an idle fellow, and though I have riot many, I have more than I ever look into.\\" - Ch. 8, Pride & Prejudice). But as to the other examples she gives (\\"chuse\\" into \\"choose\\", \\"shew\\" into\\"show\\", \\"ancle\\" into \\"ankle\\", and \\"stile\\" into \\"style\\"), I think she thought them to be typos only because she expected a modernized-spelling edition. These are spellings that Jane Auten used and it seems a very common practice to retain them in modern editions; unlike most modern editions of Shakespeare, say, where spellings are modernized. For example, Oxford World's Classics, Penguin, David M. Shapard's annotated editions from Anchor, all use these spellings instead of their modern equivalents.<br /><br />I have a number of Penguin's Kindle books (as also their paper equivalents in most cases) but I had not noticed quality problems before. I had always thought of Penguin, along with others like Oxford, as publishers whose text could be implicitly trusted to be of very high quality; maybe I am naive. But in this case Penguin has clearly not lived up to that high expectation.<br /><br />I wanted this Kindle book very much, and I am sorry I had to return it. If Penguin releases a well-proofed version in the future I am sure I shall buy it again.<br /><br />But, in the meanwhile, I just wanted to warn prospective buyers, and hopefully alert Penguin (if, that is, anybody there reads these reviews) so that they can think about scheduling a revision for this book; hence this (somewhat long) review.
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|I happen to go to Amazon to look at what kind of deals they had on the Marvel's The Avengers and found this product.  They had a notation that they would give us a cheaper price if there was a price difference.  I really didn't pay too much attention to that, but WOW - it did happen and we ended up paying almost half the actual price and a bonus that it was a 3D/BlueRay/DVD + Digital Copy + Digital Music Download made it even better.  I had no clue you could get so much for paying so little.  Amazon really came through with their promise, Thank you for that!
B009HQ9UHC|5.0|You drag the pieces to make anything that will get your pig to the map piece. I though it was very simple to find out how to play but I can see why people are confided. I think that this is even better than angry birds and maybe one of the best apps on the store. hope you have fun. thank you Rovio!
B00936A0ZW|4.0|i'm a big fan of pauls work and have been for a few years now. pauls made quite a few different types of albums in the past from, instrumental, to acoustic, to metal etc. well here is his jazzy/blues album. definitely not what i expected but it is nice to hear him sing again since its been a while since his last vocal album. personally, i dont think i'll listen to this album much, even though paul is a big influence on me. this just isnt my type of music. and i have a feeling a lot of his fans with either love it, or leave it. as someone said, his singing has gotten much better over the years, but his lyrics are still corny as ever. some if it i can deal with, but the first track \\"enemies\\" for instance, is one that i just can't help but laugh about.<br /><br />also, theres A LOT of piano on this album. and while i dont see that as a bad thing, this album is better off being called \\"vibrato by paul and emi gilbert\\" because i feel like she has more presence on this album than he does.<br /><br />thats about all i've got to say.<br /><br />all in all, well produced, guitar playing is great. but its not his typical style. so some people may enjoy it, some may not.
B008HK3XU4|4.0|Hi,<br />Great item! Nice color.<br />But, would of liked that opening it, it could of had  a slip, an area to save some small papers, so you can write down anything important that you saw on a magazine, etc, as you cannot write on the Mag, but you can use that info later. Good price on item.<br /><br />Like a slip or something.  I had a Kindle fire not HD and bought a cover from Belkin and this one did have a slip....
B008LVCKH6|4.0|In this book the main character lived with two simple goals in mind, to have enough to eat and to have some vodka to drink.  Everything he did came out of those two goals.  In the meantime it didn't hurt that he figured out how to create the atom bomb and became fluent in many languages.  This book was a fun romp through 100+ years in a life that spanned the globe and important points in history.  It made me think how simple life can be and how much we can learn if we just go with the flow like the main character in this book.
B004DI7HZ6|5.0|my new favorite. Have read 1st and 2nd books of trilogy now. Cant wait for the next. Harkness is an exceptional writer and has really done her homework.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|My son couldn't put the book down. Had eagerly waited  the release of this book and now is looking forward to the next in this amazing series.
B00138CSLM|5.0|Love the MP3 has good quality sound. Recommend to anyone. I play it on my iPod and on my phone with Amazon cloud. The price was very resonable too.
B000NTMWYU|5.0|I have many favorite movies but this one is in my top 10! I love the combination of Russell Crowe and Marion Cotillard...they are great together!
B009CPJHY4|5.0|I watched this with a friend and liked it so much I bought so I wouldn't have to wait for my movie renters to have it.
B000I9TY4G|4.0|Joss does not disappoint with this excellent piece of science fiction story telling. This movie helps to wrap up several of the threads of the story that were left hanging after the Firefly series was prematurely ended.
B00992CF6W|1.0|HEY,  AMAZON I WOULD LOVE TO GET THIS,BUT TI WOULD BE GREAT IF U COLUD PLZ PLZ PLZ MAKE A FREE VERSION!!!
B005HI4LMS|5.0|This is a hilarious comedy/slasher movie. I laughed so hard.  Have watched it several times and I laugh every time.  Recommend it for anyone who likes slasher movies and wants a good laugh.
B008BM9L72|1.0|The best thing about this book is the hype.  I haven't read such a badly written book in quite a while.  It's mildly titillating at the most but then to each his own. The characters or one dimensional and would do better in a graphic novel.  Perhaps the author should have chosen that medium instead.
1451695195|5.0|i spent six years studying the near-death experience at the UConn Medical School and am now the author of 8 books on NDEs and related subjects.<br />Dr. Alexander's account of his experience while so close to death and with a brain that had completely shut down  is excellent.<br />This is an easy read on a most important subject.
B0091REZMW|4.0|love it!!! kept my mind off things while in the hospital all night while my grandmother is dying. love mysteries and seek games.
6305428042|5.0|There was nothing wrong with this video's quality! It's a really cute movie--great for kids and families. It's a classic Halloween film.
B00003CXRM|5.0|The site said it was used, but i can't see that.  Looks new to me, and have had no issues
B004SJ3BCI|1.0|I ordered it,Amazon says I own it, but I can't find it on my Kindle. When I tried to find it under my Aps it's not there. But it looks like it would be fun.
0385738757|5.0|I have read and re-read this series by James Dashner many, many times, and each time I somehow come to love it even more (how is it possible???). Out of the three books that make up this trilogy, my absolute favorite is The Scorch Trials, which is the middle leg of the journey that one goes through while reading the books. The first book introduces the characters and their predicament to purposely draw the reader in so that they connect to story, and the last book provides a conclusion and ties up all the loose ends that weren't previously taken care of. But in the middle, you get the perfect mix of introduction and conclusion that combines to create a spectacular book.<br /> In the first book we meet Thomas, a teenager who helped a group of boys escape the maze that held them captive, and his love interest, Teresa, who along with Thomas, can communicate using only her mind. Because of the magnificent writing, we cried with Thomas when Chuck died, and felt the corresponding emotions throughout the story; the first book of the trilogy emotionally attached us to the characters like paperclips to a magnet. But, compared to the second book, it is just an appetizer for the main course. While I am metaphorically comparing this series to dinner, I shall dig even further into the metaphor. If The Maze Runner was only an appetizer, and The Death Cure was the dessert, that would logically make The Scorch Trials the main dish, and well most of us, including moi, love dessert the most, so here is a better comparison. Imagine that you are at school, during the first few periods of the day, you are tired and lethargic, then in the middle periods, your energy has reached its peak high and it is safe to say that you are pretty happy, then the last few periods come you slowly become tired again. The three books are like the periods of your day, from tired to energetic to somewhat content, and that sort of explains why I love The Scorch Trials so darn much. Let's review, book one isjust a small taste or an awakening into what is set to come in my favorite book, The Scorch Trials.<br /> In the second book, the reader is sucked back into the story through love triangles, fights, and mystery. There is back-stabbing, and well, a lot more that makes this book amazing! Just in case you didn't read the 417 words that came before this sentence, let me give you a summary of what I thought about the book. I absolutely loved it, it is the peanut butter and jelly in a PB&J (just in case you have been living under a rock, PB&J stands for peanut butter and jelly) sandwich, in others words it is the best book of the entire series. Just read it already!!!
B008GOAEXU|5.0|New 45RPM 2 LP 200gram vinyl edition from original master tapes sounds far better than any previous version including the original 1968 Electra pressing!<br />Sell your old versions and buy this one because it is the last you will ever need to own. I've tested it against the recent Rhino,(awful), Mobile Fidelity,(1980's pressing), and the fantastic DCC LP pressing from the 1990's. This one beats them all in terms of detail, dynamics, bass, Etc....
B008YU0AOE|3.0|I like Calculator Pro Free.  When in portrait mode it is a standard calculator with large numbers on the keyboard and display, which makes it easier to read without my glasses.  When in Landscape mode it changes to a scientific calculator.  The buttons and display are a little smaller in this mode.<br /><br />Overall, I am happy with it for what I need to use it for.
B00457X7XQ|3.0|Zero Day was decent enough and, for the most part, kept me engaged.  The plot finally starts to kick in a little over halfway through and finally starts to get a little interesting.  With that said, you can see the cliche plot twists coming a mile away.  My biggest problem was with how the conversations over IRC and ICQ were portrayed.  No one, I mean NO ONE, actually talks like that unless they want to look like a fool.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|very efficient and has an amazing amount of settings. I recommend this to anyone who needs a standard alarm cloak.
B004VMUS9G|4.0|I've used this app for the past 2 years and have never had any problems or inconsistancies.  Still the best.
B00846REIS|5.0|I really liked this book.  It gives you exactly what you want and keeps you turning the page.  I am so excited for book 3!
B0094BB4TW|4.0|As long as this app has been around you would think serious issues like oh I dont know say only showing 10 status updates if lucky would be non existent or fixed asap. other than this issue I actually liked the app on my Fire HD. Fix the app and I will fix my rating.<br />Nov. 24, 2012 changed my rating to 4 stars. Not perfect but loads better than it was before. Huge improvement! Thank you!!
B009LH1WLO|5.0|Loved this years season premiere. It caught us up and started us off with a bang. Makes one look forward to what's to come.
0425263908|5.0|What I loved the most about this book is that, for all the comparisons being made between this series and the 50 Shades books, it is its own story. Yes, it's an erotic adult romance; yes there is a *minute* aspect of the BDSM in their relationship; and yes, Gideon is damaged... but the similarities end there.<br /><br />Eva is just as damaged as him and I loved reading that in this story. I adored the 50 shades stories, but Anastasia's innocence was at times more annoying than endearing. Eva holds her own in the damage department! Her and Gideon are both in over their heads, both come from damaged backgrounds, and both are terrified of what the other makes them feel.<br /><br />I can't wait to see what his reaction will be each time she runs and I can't wait to see her reaction each time he shuts her out (thinking he's protecting her). It's heart-wrenching to see what they go through but so enthralling to be a part of their story. And all the heartache is worth it when I see them take a step in the right direction, even if they take 1 step forward and 3 steps back...<br /><br />I'm super excited to continue the story in Reflected in You. I'm sure Ms. Day will not disappoint!
B009O5CLZY|5.0|buy this game it is the best. and plus you never stop unlocking things unless you have no life. this game is so fun GET IT!!!!
B001NHNG64|4.0|I have grown to enjoy the Reacher series.  He is super human but with a personality and flaws.  The books are fast paced and entertaining.  Die Trying wraps in a radical secessionist group with a domestic terror plot.  The politics keep things interesting, and there is just enough technical information to make it believable.
B009VW5K12|5.0|This is a good one. I loved the brotherly camaraderie between Tony and Tim. Zeva's anger at them was a little tiresome, but still a great show.
B001KVZ6HK|4.0|All the discs are great. 3D, 2D Bluray are awesome. Havent watched the DVD or tried the digital copy. Only negative is that the discs are stored one on top of the other, 2 on each side of the case.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|good game. Brings me back to when I used to play on the computer. love it!! would recommend it. great!
B007FEFLTO|4.0|Couldn't put it down.  Great characters, sweeping vistas of history.  Would've like to see more detail about more of the characters lives.  Tied great historical events to individual lives in a mostly believable way.
B009WJX10G|1.0|I adore \\"Supernatural\\" but this is the worst episode of all so far. Very little of the Winchesters. Mostly about three college kids with our heroes thrown in--for what, I'm not really sure. Very disappointing. I hope this is the last one like this and they return to following our guys.
B0091REZMW|5.0|For being free this is one great game. It has so much going on. You will never be bored. This is a keeper.
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|This is a fun game with super graphics! This could become addictive!  I think the kids would like it, too.
B007THA4FI|2.0|I really expected a much better story from J. K. Rowling than what I got in the Casual Vacancy.  Characters were cliche and not well developed.  Mostly gloomy and dark subject matter, with little redemption.
B00910Y1OQ|4.0|A visually stunning game.  Smooth game play and varied screen mechanics make for an enjoyable and time passing experience.  Well worth the investment.
0143117157|5.0|This is book is about more than a sports story.  This is a story of human depravity and greatness.  As well choreographed as any truly great Hollywood film (and incidentally turned into a movie with Morgan Freeman and Matt Damon) or magnificent epic novel.  Beautifully written and told with heartfelt sincerity this book completely captivated me even though I already knew the ending.  I was riveted with each turn of the page, waiting in eager anticipation to see how the final triumph was brought into fruition.<br /><br />With the effortless flow of the narrative Carlin delicately unfurls the story like a blooming flower with each page coming together to create a colorful and deliciously scented bloom.  Carlin masterfully orchestrates the different firsthand accounts and different viewpoints to put a together a fairly complete picture of the lead up to the South African hosted Rugby World Championship and the crowning jewel of Mandela's presidentship.  He lays out enough background to help us understand how incredible this turn of events were and gives enough individual stories to get the real impact of the situation.  His compassion for all sides allows him to understand the differing viewpoints and pass that understanding onto us.<br /><br />Mandela is sketched as a clever, deliberate, politically savvy man raised up for just such a time in his country's history to help it navigate the choppy waters of fear and impatience. Mandela is a genius; he knew where he wanted to take his country, found a means to get there, and convinced people from very fragmented groups to help implement a plan of action.  \\"One Team, One Country\\" was not only the motto for the Springboks, but for every South African.  Now granted the road from there has been bumpy for the country, but that should not take away from what it has accomplished and can accomplish in the future.<br /><br />For the full review and others visit whymsylikesbooks dot blogspot dot com
B00338QENI|4.0|Loved reading about the infancy of cell experimentation; so interesting to \\"catch up\\" to where we stand now, scientifically and ethically, in this field!  Henrietta Lacks and her family are unsung heroes as they were guinea pigs in the process that brought us invaluable scientific and disease knowledge and that made at least some of the scientific and medical community look hard at the ethical ramifications of their impact on families.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|I love Mr. Riordan's work. He makes me love the characters and shows me magical world I want to exist. I enjoy all of his ya material and look forward to starting on his adult. I would recommend this series to anyone with a love for ancient Greek and Roman culture. Mr. Riordan does his research.
B008133DO8|5.0|Intelligent - smart - excellent acting and story telling. One of my favorite shows. I love the modern take on the classic stories.
B008NW67IQ|5.0|I would have to say that I usually brace myself for a letdown when a band that put out a great debut album releases their second album.  That is not an issue with Babel.  As good as Sigh No More is, Babel is even better.  Rather than go through a longwinded description of each song, let me just say that this album is worth dropping a few bucks on.  Trust me.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|It is a fun game that allows you to play a lot of small minni games. Each game is different and has a ranging amount of difficulty.
B001U9BRNE|5.0|This is one Terrific show from start to finish. The Video and Sound quality are top notch, as for the performances and the songs...WOW, great stuff.<br /><br />I was pretty familiar with David Foster before purchasing this Blu-Ray, but I had NO Idea of the true extent of his talent....he is good...VERY VERY Good. I actually teared up a bit during the Andrea Bocelli - Katharine McPhee performance of \\"The Prayer\\" , it's really beautiful...and there are MANY wonderful performances throughout this disc. Impressive stuff...
B00973902K|5.0|Such a catchy tune. Is there anyone who hasn't heard this yet?  I dare you not to start tapping your foot when you hear it !!!!!
B00846REIS|5.0|Having read the 50 Shades series, I must  say that I have found another series that has captured my attention just as intensely if not more so! Great read! On to #2 and anxiously awaiting #3!
B009VB97EY|3.0|Ok ladies. I rented it because I'm like every other female, men stripping, I'm there. I didn't go to the movie but thought about buying it. I read the previous review. I thought I would rent it instead. I'm glad I did. I watched it a couple of times just for the dance scenes and of course for Joe!! OMG loved his scenes. Too bad there wasn't much of the strip scenes. Just less than a minute each. Maybe the blue day has more. Ok so I knew it was loosely based on chandlers real life. But didn't realize that it would not have strip scenes in it. Geez. What a tease from PR. Yes the movie is about June, July and August and of Mikes new friendship with the kid. How the kid is shy and clean. But within 3 months gets into drugs and sex. Hmmm doesn't every teenager experience this. Maybe not as much as his gets into it. Sad. I'm glad that I didn't buy the movie. Would it be worth watching Joe enlarge himself or for the 2 second fireman scene. Not worth the money to buy the movie. Thanks for the movie.  Matthew your name brought people to the movie, but his age is showing by standing by the boys!  The youth has muscles.  Perfect. Not like the body builders, but just right where Matthew is lean.  Not even a six pack showing.  Would have been nice if he worked on bulking up a bit.
B0015DWJX2|5.0|Fell in love with all the characters, the setting etc.  The book is written in letters between the characters so it is a little hard to follow at first, but once you do get used to it, you can't help but fall in love.
B0026IUXO2|5.0|I loved this movie so much! What an amazing portrayal of an amazing true story! I suggest this movie to anyone looking for a historical film with depth that captures you and leaves you wanting me!
B0053O89WY|5.0|Loved it. Can watch it over and over again. Have all so far and will continue to buy future seasons.
B009A3NGF4|4.0|The Boys are back on Babel and they still sound great. I like it when a band stays true to thier sound while not sounding exactly the same, and I think Mumford and Sons have succeeded in doing that on Babel.  The title track, I Will Wait, and Lover of the Light are early stand outs and great sing along tunes.  While most of the other tracks grow on you after each listening.  Lovers' Eyes and the bonus track Where Are You Now stand out to me in this way.  I was eagerly anticipating this release and while I still think Sign No More is the standard for Mumford and Sons, Babel is a great follow-on that I'll be spending plenty of time listening to for quite awhile.
B0083SBMBM|1.0|Yes. They may be right in their opinions, but the movie is bad. Mindless action sequences interrupted by long mindless dialogue. Not for me, and I am a little boy at heart, but this was too much.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Ok for all you fans of Shades of Gray this is the book you should read!  I love the story and the ending had me screaming out loud! I have been a fan of Sylva Day for years and read anything and everything she writes!
0439023521|5.0|I bought this book for my son - he liked it so much, that I ordered the other two books in the series.
B00542UOEG|4.0|When I was a little one, \\"Benji\\" was the crossover film for my generation in the sense that it was the movie I watched after growing out of strictly cartoon movies and before only watching actual movies.<br />We wanted something like that for our little guys and since one of mine LOVES Chihuahuas (odd I know) we opted to watch this for our family movie night.<br />It was actually quite entertaining and well done. A good family flick. Silly story, cute talking dogs.<br />Now we are roped in so I am hoping it's sequels are just as good.<br />Amazon makes it so easy to access these movies and they are almost always $1-2 less than what my cable provider charges.
B007X4ECMI|1.0|This is one of the worst sf movies in history. Repugnant violence, because the director wants you to be thrilled so the violence is not justified. No way. And the villain doesn't get punished before the ending. And the ending is lame, because you were waiting for something else. An the acting is juvenile and amateurish. And so is the director. And there is noise in space, because the producers missed physics 101 in school.
B0087JTAKW|5.0|Learn to appreciate that time with our loved ones is precious, refreshing book.  First time I read a book by Mitch Albom.  Definately will look for other titles by him.  I will remember this one for a long time.  A different and not expected twist at the end that will leave you thinking about what's valuable and what is not in your paricular situation.<br /><br />Loved it!
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|Love it. Very mindless (for the most part) and loads of fun :) Great way to pass the time. And room for progress to give the game some meaning.
B008XNZMOU|2.0|First off I have to say is I love listening to Taylor Swift. I loved her from her first album \\"Taylor Swift\\" to her latest \\"Speak Now\\" album. This new album \\"Red\\" is something new coming from her which is different and not so \\"country\\" like her last albums. This new album is more pop-ish and perky, it's not what made me loved her from the beginning. Her writings and lyrics are great but I wish she would have tone down a bit back to her roots that made her famous. I got the deluxe album and loved only 5 songs out of 22 songs, which is not good for me.
B0063IH60K|5.0|great game.  cant beat the price!<br />very addicting! will probably get the ad free one soon.<br />plays well on the kindle fire hd.
B005LAIHY0|5.0|I just finished watching Prometheus and I must say dispite all the mixed reviews, I found it to be a wonder to behold. Not only is it in 3-D but it's deep also meaning it is very thought provoking. The acting was great and most of the scenes and action were spectacular. This is what movies should be.<br /><br />When I was younger there was a film called 2001 A Space Odyssey and in order to fully enjoy and understand it, you should see it more than once and I feel this movie also falls into that category, even for me. My suggestion is, have a seat,turn out the lights, pay close attention, and enjoy.
B000FC1AGG|4.0|this was a very cute book. Perfect for a light easy read! This was simple entertainment with good characters and a nice plot.
B0012GMUI6|5.0|I first listened to this on a borrowed cassette on Walkman walking around my local town in the late 80's. It was one of those moments you never forget. It was a beautiful late afternoon, not many people around etc etc and I pressed play. A little under an hour later I had travelled Waters' journey through hookups, incredulity, sexual revolution, serenity, betrayal and absolution ... to the final Every Stranger's Eyes. I had one of those \\"down the rabbit hole\\" experiences where I was absolutely immersed and \\"in the zone\\". A truly amazing experience.<br /><br />Other reviews have noted this is an end to end concept album and single tracks out of context do not necessarily stand up or stand out alone. Nevertheless Waters is in full flight - from wimsy to rage to despair and everything in between. Clapton's guitar work is back in searing form after what I thought was a pretty bland late 70's. (Granted he was getting his life back together.)<br /><br />I am amazed many more people have not heard this album or do not rate it that much. I remember that walk and will always consider it a landmark album.
B008K6HN8I|5.0|I was so happy to find an app that lets me find what I'm looking for and find it quickly. I wish I had discovered this sooner, because I use this quite frequently.
B001TAJGO6|5.0|Great combination of romance and sci fi. Every time I put the movie on I have to sit through and watch the entire film<br />Worth the money
B0028IDXDS|4.0|Great idea ; cute monkey but my 6 month old great neice didn't like it.she would not use it at all.
B008602KQI|5.0|Just a great movie, eventhough we already know it's incomplete (two more to follow). The bonus disk is OK, and the digital copy is great--nice to to buy something and have it in all formats.
B008G8SFGO|2.0|It must be a tough job being a Mastering Engineer these days.  The job is to make a recording sound as good as possible while being pressured to have the recording get the most attention, in other words, BE THE LOUDEST.<br /><br />However, there is a limit on HOW LOUD music encoded to compact disc can be.  The only way to increase perceived loudness within this limitation is to apply compression, and this was done extensively on the CD version of this release.<br /><br />When I popped in the title, at about 6 seconds into Track 1, I noticed a harshness to the recording.  Drums sound best when they have a strong attack, with a natural decay.  Eric might as well be playing cardboard boxes with the drum tone on this album.  Such a big deal was made about how analog equipment was used during recording, but none of the natural warmth of such gear is present after the heavy-handed compression is applied to make the overall signal as loud as possible.<br /><br />Pop in any of your older Kiss CDs... perhaps the first to feature the drumming of Eric Singer, \\"Revenge\\", and do a comparison, especially of the drums... The tone is gone, the dynamics are gone. The vocals have a harshness during the louder vocal melodies.<br /><br />Hopefully all these artists who are destroying their own music have preserved the pre-compressed recordings so that once the loudness war has ended, they can release a full dynamic version of their albums.  The performances on this CD are great.  Kiss is back in form. Unfortunately they are following the trend of compressing the music to death, and Monster has fallen victim to the Loudness War.

B009HQ9UHC|3.0|I like this game but idiot its just... all I'm saying is if you don't get too mad at frozen screens and having restart your kindle, then you'll like it
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|at most gas place they have something like this and I love playing it.  this game is fun and easy
B009UQCD0K|5.0|The first few season 3 episodes were a little slow, and it seemed like the series had seen better days, but now things are getting juicy again.<br />With less emphasis on people fighting the walkers, and more on the experiences of the group, this story is full of never ending surprises for anyone who has never read the books.<br />The actors do an outstanding job in their roles, and the situations the characters get involved in, keep me hoping this series continues for a very long time.<br />What will Andrea do when she finds out her boyfriend is a disgusting psychopath?<br />How about Earl and Darrel, how will they get along with each other now?<br />What will become of Woodbury when the truth about the governer is revealed?<br />How long until the next person gets bit?<br />Will the disease ever end? Will the walkers ever die? Will Carl and his sister have a beautiful world someday? Or is the stinking world that the show is based on all they'll ever know?<br />I haven't read any of the books, so I'll either watch the entire series, or make up my own ending.<br />Is that a violation of the Patriot Act? Is the Patriot Act a violation of the United States Constitution? YES.<br />And now that season 3 has ended, and no doubt season 4 will be the last, maybe, just maybe, people will have had enough of death, rot, murder, insanity, etc. for a while, but I doubt it.<br />After all, the world hasn't ended yet, and isn't that what everyone wants? Like they will be one of the \\"lucky\\" few who will be around to watch it all happen, and then go on playing with all the toys that are left behind.<br />Oh what a disgusting world. Stupid and disgusting.<br />But yes, I like to watch the stupid program too.
B009HQ9UHC|5.0|im so addicted to this game this and angry birds are the best games on here. they are amazing I totally recommend this game and all the angry birds.
B0096DFBZQ|5.0|my son loves this game it's great for him to learn how to use these games out today. i enjoy watching him smile.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Amazing book absolutly great ending was so not expecting the hole coin thing but , in the end turned out fantastic and happy to know katniss ended up with peeta and have kids love love love this series maybe a future book on peeta and katnisses kids?
B005HV6Y84|5.0|The soundtrack has obviously been out a while but the review is still accurate in that it is a great soundtrack reflective of the emaotions evoked from the film.  I feel this soundtrack captures a depth to the movie that some of the other soundtracks' lack.  The soundtrack and movie both get back to origins and are great addition to the twilight universe.
B0060ZJ74O|4.0|Like so many that have been coming out lately (i.e., The Blind Side, Secretariat, etc.), this one is right there with these. If you are an avid sports fan, you should enjoy this film. The story is about Billy Bean, general manager (and still is) of the Oakland A's. The story revolves around how a small market baseball team can ever compete with the big boys... ala New York Yankees and Boston Red Sox. An excellent story, it takes you through Billy's gamble to rethink and reinvent how baseball is done with respect to obtaining talent and value for it.<br /><br />If you are a fan of baseball, this would be a must own. Since I am a fan of the Kansas City Royals, it also gives us \\"poor folk\\" a bit of sunshine and hope that we can again be competitive and not relegated to a glorified minor league franchise for the \\"big boys\\" to come and steal our talent away. I think this is one of Brad Pitt's better films (and I am not a big fan of his).
B007MDB6L0|5.0|My girls loved this new Tinkerbell movie and so did I. It's very child friendly, loving and wonderful.<br /><br />If I had rented at redbox instead of buying, I would have ended up buying this.<br /><br />There were no evil fairies or people.. I really loved it!
B008CPBB0I|4.0|It's hard to find a good moral family movie these days, this is a great one! Have a blessed day!
B004VRL4AS|1.0|I sent this back.  I HAVE NEVER RECEIVED MY MONEY BACK!  DO NOT USE THIS COMPANY!<br /><br />It wasn't stated that it wouldn't play on dvd players in the United States.  Very disappointing
B0083SBJXS|5.0|This is one of the best movies that Marvel has put out, in my opinion. Joss Whedon being picked to write and direct this movie was nothing short of shear genius by the Marvel folks. Something I definitely look for in a movie series is the consistency with the actors playing their previous roles. Robert Downing Jr. gave another stellar performance as Tony Stark, and Chris Evans did a great job as Captain Avenger. The Black Widow and Hawkeye played a bigger role in this movie and helped round out those characters, who we only got a glimpse of in the previous Marvel movies on the individual heroes leading up to this one. The only exception to this was Mark Rufio, who played Bruce Banner, aka \\"The Hulk\\". This gave me pause when Robert Norton was not selected for the role but Mark did an excellent job at filling the part. So much so that it would have been nice to see him rather then Norton in the original.<br /><br />For any sci-fi, action adventure nut, this is a real gem. I would put it on par with the Lord of the Rings Trilogy, as far as story goes. This is a must own and as long as Marvel keeps Joss Whedon in the mix, I think they can only go up with this series and I think they are sitting on a gold mine. Let's hope they don't screw it up like they failed miserably on the second Fantastic Four movie, The Rise of the Silver Surfer. If they keep everything as is, I don't think that the next movie will be a let down.
B006LSZECO|4.0|I chose this book for my book club, Dinner and a Book and when I started it I began to regret it. Then the twist came and I couldn't put it down. It started slow then 30% into it and it suddenly threw you for a loop.This book would make a great movie.
B0090P98Z4|5.0|this game is awesome. plus it is free. get this...... it is totally worth it. don't be cheap it is free.
B008FSCNTK|3.0|It's just ok. Thought it would be much better; sounds to me like she just needed the money so she threw this group together and recorded it. Just fair.
B007C3TVEY|4.0|As parent of two boys and based off some of the reviews of this movie I was very unsure whether I should watch We Need to Talk about Kevin. While it does focus on Kevin, the son who is troubled, disturbed, depressed and at times violent, this films main character is the mother Eva, Played by Tilda Swinton. The cast was perfectly chosen and the multiple children who played Kevin were ideal to play one another at different ages as they look so much alike. And the older Kevin, played by Ezra Miller greatly resembles Tilda Swinton and is very believable as her son.<br /><br />I watched this movie the other night and I cannot get it out of my mind. It is very intense, there is a lot of symbolism and there are little things which happen and you must put the pieces together as the movie is all over the place and events are not presented in order. It is disturbing at times and makes you uncomfortable at others, yet you cannot wait to unravel the secret of the film. To start off you know something drastic happened, yet it is a very slow transformation to reveal what event happened.<br /><br />While a movie like this would usually leave a person depressed, I was surprisingly not so. I enjoyed the film and each level of sophistication and art style that I almost instantly wanted to watch it again.<br /><br />So is it worth a blind buy on Blu-ray? I would say yes! I greatly enjoyed We Need to Talk About Kevin and I am proud to own such a masterpiece of a film in my collection. Highly recommended.
B00910Y1OQ|2.0|Babylon level 6 can in NO WAY be finished! 6 squares are closed and items inside cannot be swiped, including the pieces required to finish the game. There is an earlier level that couldn't be finished without the tile bomb. The game deserves 5 stars, but got 2 stars because the developer never cared to try to play and finish there game, which can't be done!
B000001G1E|5.0|This collection of James Brown cd's are the best collection of cd's. This price is more than appropriate. I love listening to these cd's.

B0091REZMW|5.0|fun to play once you get the hang of it. sometimes to short a play.  other times realy long. would recommend it.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|I'm starting to find the love of writing and this app helps me on the go. I like the mobile app better than the desktop version. totally five stars
B008I34YYY|1.0|Great concept, utterly ruined by nasty political rhetoric.  It could have been funny, smart and hip, but if that's what passes for smart and hip, I'll pass. I seldom feel bad about wasting my time watching a movie, but this was one of those times. Straight out of the player and into the trash can.<br /><br />One star because there is no Zero star.
B002P79KAC|5.0|It is rare in this day and age when a uniquely styled comedy comes out into mainstream tv. This is one of them. Not only does it remain fresh each episode, it is not a show where the common gag or common punchline elicits laughter. The material is smartly written and also fact checked with a resident physicist and/or other expert in the fields they are putting their characters into on a regular basis. This show is a treat to young and old and will forever be a favorite of many, many  people. Now, having said all of that, be aware that if you choose to take the Sheldon approach to knocking on your boss's door, make sure he either knows about the show or watched it. Otherwise, you will get the Penny treatment. 'Nuff said. :-)
B008Y2FRFO|1.0|Boring boring boring this app sucks. Waste of space uninstall immediately!  Even my kids hated it, once again uninstall immediately!
B0086700CM|4.0|I love temple run and I play it every single day but u hus wish that they would have upgrades and new kids of people and powers and abilities because then the game would never get old.
B003UYUQZW|5.0|Came EARLY! Packaged  nice. An extra seal over the DVD, which was cool. And an awesome movie! [I wish there was a sequel though-very underrated].
B008WCP2PG|4.0|So I've already seen the movie in the theater and loved it. The only reason I'm writing this critique is because I bought the regular DVD version, and under the product description it says:<br /><br />Special Features:<br /><br />Deleted Dance Scenes<br />Behind the Scenes with Magic Mike<br />The Moves of Magic Mike<br /><br />The only special feature my DVD had was the Behind the Scenes part. I was really excited about seeing the deleted dance scenes, and it turns out I don't get to.<br /><br />Boo Amazon, Boo.
0156030306|4.0|The author was one of my college English professors and I remember reading this many, many years ago. While watching a TV show recently they mentioned the book and it sparked an interest in me to re-read the book. I remembered the general idea of the book but it was interesting to read with a focus on the details Keyes, the author, used. It is a hard book to put down, an easy read, and a moral issue to consider. Perhaps even a personal lesson, for some of us, is also hidden. Happy reading!
B000002O1Q|5.0|I bought this item for my twin sister. We both love this movie so I bought it for her birthday. Thanks for having it and the quick delivery.
B0087HT36U|5.0|I really enjoy playing Siege Hero every evening.  What a fun way to unwind after a crazy day.  I highly recommend this game.  Don't take it too seriously, just play for the fun of it.
B009NQKPUW|1.0|Prometheus is a disaster. Terrible, incoherent script that insults your intelligence. Its like Ridley and Damon Lindelof didn't even bother and were in a rush. Lindelof is the traitor who destroyed LOST by basing it on false promises and undelivered expectations. He continues his legacy with Prometheus. Don't reward bad film making by renting this film. Don't encourage them.
B006BGZJJ4|5.0|The cable works perfectly; thank you. Oddly, and as many people have written, my original cable fell apart and crumbled to the floor with  just brushing by it, or holding it up. Many others have written this; Amazon/Kindle should provide buyers with replacement cords for free, or cords at a deeply discounted price.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|Fun game like being at the fair!  Will kill lots of time when waiting for appointments, meetings,  etc. Recommend the download!
B009439HEY|5.0|Steve Hackett is mindful that he is navigating sensitive ground in revisiting the Genesis canon. That mindfulness is present in every facet of this project... from the track selection, to the performances, to the packaging itself... this is a lovingly rendered homage to the artistry of the Hackett era of Genesis. Kudos to Hackett, King et al. for the countless hours that they must have logged in order to make this sterling gift to discerning Genesis fans everywhere!
0141439513|5.0|I actually had bought this book but didn't immediately read it. It wasn't until I had to watch the 2005 movie for my Women in Literature class that I fell in love with it. I quickly started reading this book and couldn't believe I waited so long. It is definitely one of my all time favorite books.
B000SC245E|5.0|I like Brother brand, I was happily use the product, so far so good.  I received the product very quick.  Thanks for the sender.

B005LAII9Y|5.0|Going from a short, to a feature-length movie, my main question<br />walking in was, \\"What did Tim add?\\" The answer is \\"A lot\\", so much<br />in fact that I felt kind of disoriented with the story, compared<br />to what I remember of the original.<br /><br />It wasn't until the movie was over and I had some time to think<br />about it, that I began appreciate all this. I've seen a lot of<br />Tim Burton films, and I think he has a keen eye for what it means<br />to be human.<br /><br />With Frankenweenie, Tim has a lot to say, and he says it. The thing<br />is, he's communicating about things which other directors generally<br />don't. That means it takes some time and thought to pick up on what<br />he's saying. There's no cliches to get a handle on. Its kind of like<br />watching two movies at once, one is the apparent content, the other<br />is the meaning behind it.<br /><br />One of the best examples is the disjunction between the world of<br />kids, and the world of adults. In other movies this is basically<br />a social commentary, but in Frankenweenie the disjunction is much<br />more in the basic fabric of each world. When Tim first shows the<br />\\"shining faces\\" of the kids in Victor's science class, he shows them<br />as Victor sees them, not as Victor's parents would. Its a shock.<br />When Victor's father explains the art of his job, its a different<br />kind of shock, something we recognize as adults.<br /><br />Another example is what Tim is saying about the world as Sparky<br />sees it. This is where the movie really shines. Tim can add more<br />depth here in the remake, because Sparky is animated. Yet true to<br />the original, Tim allows Sparky to remain entirely a dog, and not<br />a human. The result is that Sparky is a very life-like dog character,<br />created with Tim's empathy and insights into Sparky and his world.<br />Some of the commentary here is profound. If you ever saw Family Dog,<br />you may see connections here.<br /><br />Going back to the added material, Tim decided that if he was going<br />to have a feature-length movie about a boy and his dog, he would<br />include a girl and her cat. Naturally these characters are, for the<br />most part, opposites of Victor and Sparky. Yet the cat is often like<br />a real cat, and the girl does have a human connection with her cat.<br />The characters are not caricatures, they're just, well, very different.<br />And in the end, sad.<br /><br />When Tim gets into the social relationships between the kids, he raises<br />different themes, makes broader comments about the world we live in.<br />I don't want to give it away, but he gets in deep on the topics of<br />being an individual, competing in a group, and the unforeseen consequences<br />that can arise from both. There is a lot of cause-and-effect going on<br />in this movie.<br /><br />In fact, there is a whole lot going on in this movie, period :-)
B004W1GCQO|5.0|Incredible show!  Great story line and writing, incredible acting and beautiful scenery and costumes. I was hooked on this series after the 1st episode. Such a welcomed change from reality tv. OUTSTANDING in all ways!
B007IXWL2C|5.0|fifty Shades was a great story and I really enjoyed it.  I would recommend it to any one who like love stories.
B004JN1D2I|4.0|I loved everything about these books except that they didn't have an ending. I hurried to buy the 5th book but when I read a really comprehensive review about that book, I found that the author had still left the characters hanging. Rather than be frustrated further, I chose not to buy the 5th book. I hope to wait out the author to develop & complete his ending. Instead, I watched the HBO series. In my opinion, they were not even close to as good as the books. But then, movies rarely are. Of course, the series also changed things from the book versions. Again, I came away frustrated. This is a good set of books. It would really be nice to read the story lines to conclusion or at least to some sort of logical event-ending for all the characters. I realize I'm not a writer; I don't know how it's done, but the way the 4th book ended just didn't seem proper, nor did the review of the 5th book ending. IMHO.
B009HQ9UHC|5.0|I love this so much it is super fun its better than angry birds and. I played angry birds before like a million times
0062024329|4.0|I had no idea that this book was basically comic related and not basic reading.  I was truly thrown off of the fact that I didn't research it before I bought it.  I truly think that the people whom love comics will truly love this book, but for me, I bought another one, the 'non' graphic novel to read.  The reading for me is slow, and I'm not finished with it yet, but such a great book and I imagine this Graphic novel of it is good as well.  I'm just not that type of reader...
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|8t is the best game ever.  no kidding.  free unless you want to pay.  then the sky is the limit.
B007IXWKUK|4.0|Very good book.. Kept my interest and I couldn't put it down. Very nice details..  Almost as good as the first one
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|One of the greatest movies!!!  Okay, yes, this is fiction and all, but it's been one of my favorite action movies of all time!  Not to mention, Amazon had this item for preorder for $24.99 until the movie came out.  When the movie came out, the price changed to $19.99 so I thought, well... should I go out of my way to go to Walmart and buy the 'basic' dvd version of this movie for $17.99/+tax? Or buy the 3D, Blu-ray, Digital Copy, DVD & Soundtrack for $19.99/+tax on Amazon?  Not to mention, I have Amazon Prime and I received my copy within 2 days of purchasing the product and the shipping was FREE!  I think the $2 difference was definitely worth it, not to mention that with the gas prices, I probably would've spent an additional $2 just to go to the store and get the movie.  I am very impressed with Amazon!  Thank you so much!

B008RTE08E|4.0|Beatles: Magical Mystery Tour<br />2012 Apple DVD<br /><br />This Apple version of the television special is a true remaster and the only version worth owning.  Still, it never was the greatest bit of entertainment ever made, in fact, for an hour-long show; some of it is downright boring.  However, it is worth owning for its visual versions of \\"I am the walrus\\", \\"Fool on the hill\\", \\"Blue Jay Way\\", and \\"Your mother should know\\".<br /><br />This DVD has a commentary track by Paul with is nice, but not as informative as one would expect.<br /><br />There are various re-edits of the songs as bonus bits, but the visuals are mainly pieces of footage that are not an improvement over the original film versions.<br /><br />The best bonus feature is the inclusion of Traffic's \\"The Mulberry Bush\\" (which was left out of the original film).  Seeing this very early version of Traffic is a real treat.<br /><br />The film (even at its best) is only a 3 1/2 Star film, but its remaster plus the bonus features make this a Four Star DVD.
1423140605|5.0|If you like other Rick Riordan's series, this is a nice book to read.  My daughter (aged 11) loves his books, she's a bit of a reader, and can't wait for the next one to come out.  I don't know how she does it, but she's reading 10 other books alongside this one and yet, I can barely even read one.....in a matter of months!  If you have a child and are looking for something for them to read, this is recommended.  Thanks!
B00932IP1W|5.0|The Homeland series is more entertaining and suspenseful that any other tv series or movie I have seen in the past years. The first season was in 12 episodes. I purchased the first six episodes from Amazon in HD then rented discs 2-3.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|I thought it had a great beginning. I loved that it started right were Catching Fire ended. All in all it was a great book I really liked it.
0307474259|5.0|I have to say I didn't know what to expect when a coworker recommended this book but I'm happy I gave the book a try. After reading through the science it's hard to deny carbs are the main reason we get fat. Yes there are other factors, such as heredity, but by large the number one reason is our carb-laden diet.<br /><br />I've long believed in the exercise more and eat less philosophy for weight loss but this makes me realize that does not work for most people. I myself am lean and extremely active and athletic (I run ultramarathons), but I've often looked at other people and wondered why they just don't do SOMETHING to lose weight. Now I can stop being so high and mighty (yes, I'll admit to that) and realize most overweight people aren't being given the best advice and guidance for weight loss.<br /><br />This book was a great read that make the science very understandable and accessible and allows you to truly understand what goes on in your body when you eat food. Yes, you still have to take the steps to make the changes but really, isn't your health the best reason to do that? Definitely recommend this to anyone who is looking to change their diets -- and their life -- to be healthier.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|this was the best ever book i have read in a long<br />time.we need a movie now!the author did a very good<br />job writing this story.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|It took me a while to purchase this book because there were so many negative reviews about it. Anyways, I'm glad I purchased this book, because it was GREAT! The the first thing I loved was that the author started this book, right where she left off of from the last book. I do agree with other people on their reviews where they say, \\" This book is an emotional roller coaster\\" because truly it is. If its not one thing its another. Another thing I liked were the sex scenes, and how there was so much emotion involved between Gideon and Eva, and BTW there were a TON of sex scenes!!! (which I LOOVE). Eva is one strong woman going into this book, the way she handles some of the situations from Gideon is amazing. At times I was thinking OMG!! how could she just take that, or how could they still be together when they treat each other like that. But like the book states \\" sometimes love just isn't enough\\" .... I can not wait until the 3rd one comes out!! If you all dont know, i believe it will be available May 2013 or March.. one of those \\"M\\" months. Well I fell in LOVE with Eva and Gideon in the first book, and fell MORE IN LOVE with them in the second book...

B000N680VW|5.0|When a mugging goes wrong and his parents are killed, young Bruce Wayne learns the hard way about criminals and their ways.  Heir to a great fortune, Bruce uses his wealth and company resources to fight crime.  A terrifying childhood experience with bats leads him to become The Batman -- scourge of criminals in Gotham City.  This movie takes the viewer through the formation of the Caped Crusader, his friendship with the man who would become Commissioner Gordon, and Bruce's struggles to keep his secret life and his public life separate.  Looked on by some as a menace, Batman continues to fight crime in his unorthodox way.  Captivating movie!  Christian Bale does an wonderful job as Batman/Bruce Wayne.  We see the man behind the hero.  I also especially love Morgan Freeman as Lucius Fox, Bruce's chief developer of technological marvels.  This movie is full of action.  It makes you believe in The Batman.
B0083GOPSG|3.0|I liked this movie.  The whole family watched, we have a high schooler.  Do not recommend this film for middle school or younger kids.  It is violent, attempted to tell a story about abuse of power, kinda fell short.  Story is about a group of boys, whom are more acquaintances than friends.  Two of the boys are closer, one is the outcast to society, etc.  They Gain powers through discovery of a meteor type object.  The extent of their powers is explored, but they leav unexplained the side effect of using their powers...  It is filmed in \\"Reality TV\\" Documentary style, which kind of gets old, and overdone.  But as far as just entertainment, it is a good choice.  I dont regret watching, hahaha.
B008ZVXNX2|5.0|Simply. Beautiful. Music. The perfect companion for the Fifty Shades trilogy. Truly a reawakening to the love of classical music.
B004FGMDOQ|5.0|My 12 year old daughter read this for an assignment in school. She loved it, so of course I had to read it! Very well written...characters are unique and realistic. The story is awesome, so different from anything I've read before. Really gets you thinking even when the book is done!
B009HQ9UHC|5.0|this game is way more addicting than angry birds. love it so much awesome awesome awesome make a seasons next rovio
B004UC4HCG|5.0|Over a period of 3 months I bought 6 of these units.  They make up my 'Folding at Home' server farm.  They are small and look nice side-by-side on the black metal racks where they live.<br /><br />I am running Ubuntu 12.04 on them, using a fast USB stick as the only 'hard drive'.  The units happily boot and run off the USB stick.  Each unit has an i7 processor and 4 gigs of ram.  Their CPU usage is 100% all the time as they fold protein models for the 'Folding at Home' project.  They have been running for 3 months continuously without overheating (thanks to the ICE cooling design) or needing rebooting (thanks to Ubuntu/Linux as the OS).<br /><br />I did get one unit that refused to POST (Power On Self Test).  After a little testing I found the the first memory slot was not responding.  Amazon sent a replacement unit immediately, and paid for the return shipping for the bad unit as well.  I could not have asked for better customer service; it took the sting out of getting a bad unit.<br /><br />If you plan to use this unit as a base for your personal computer, it is a fine choice.  I suggest going with an Intel processor that has the HD4000 in the CPU (Ivy Bridge); the performance from that is enough to handle most basic games.  I have five i7 units with HD3000 (Sandy Bridge) and one i7 unit with HD4000 (Ivy Bridge); the performance for basic games is much better with the HD4000 (I did some quick testing before they got sent to 'Server Farm Duty').<br /><br />There is room for up to a mid-level video card (these are limited more by power draw then physical card size) for gamers considering this unit.<br /><br />My only suggestion is to purchase your own thermal paste for the installation of the CPU as the paste included is rather stiff and hard to use (but it will work).  I used one purchased thermal paste tube for all 6 units combined.  A little goes a long way.<br /><br />I expect I will never use a large case again after using the shuttle bare bones for these last 6 builds.6 builds.
B0052GACNM|4.0|Well worth the money - a very enjoyable CD and most remarkable when you consider the age of the main vocalist - still has what it takes after all the years in the business.  Lpooking forward to the next set of Duets!
B001MTENOC|5.0|Michael Newton has changed my life with this incredibly well written book detailing what happens to us after our current life ends.  Years of research through hypnosis has given us answers we've all been looking for.  Michael Newton is not starting a movement or religion, he simply has shown us the truth.  Thank you Michael Newton!
B008673ZAQ|2.0|Very, week wrighting....I almost did not want to finsh the book. Will not down load the third book when it comes out. In case you are thinking that I must be one of those woman that did not like 50 shades of grey, YOU ARE WRONG!! would read that again 10X over before another of her books :-((
B0090P98Z4|4.0|This game is a standard hack and slash game. Nothing to make it stand out from the pack,  but it is still something fun to do in your spare time.
B008UJDOOC|5.0|Love this album and can't wait for Take Me Home to come out. I am a directioner and have bought all of 1D's music! My favorite song is Live While We're Young. Cd plays great and arrived on time with good packaging, PLUS the 1D poster that comes out of the cd cover, I love it!!!!! <3
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|This trilogy kept me reading day and night!! The second book will blow your mind! I never expected what happened to happen. The third book was so suprising! I'm so glad my sister recommended them to me! I would totally recommend you to read them all. They are even better than the movie, which I saw first.
B0038NN3B4|5.0|Bought the book on the 10th.  My first 14 days and 16 lbs. Lighter.  Blood pressure is down as well.  Great make sense book.  Answered most of my questions and is backed by a websight full of help.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|When I read the reviews of the book they all concentrate on the sex, and they miss completely what keeps me hooked.<br />The mere suffering of Christian.  Believe it or not there are more Christians out there than anyone is willing to admit. I am hooked as I am always on Psychological isues.  Tremendous books.  The author surely had a lot of help from professionals dealing with this. I have not read the last book yet, but no matter how it turns The Christians of the world will never outlive this kind of horrific suffering.
B0063IH60K|4.0|Basic app but easy to use and fun. Reminds me of playing solitaire on my first computer when I was a kid.
1451695195|4.0|This book is well written and not heavy-handed in the area of religion.  Told from the perspective of a scientist and analyzed against a background of medicine and science, it is a compelling thesis about life after life.  It is an easy read (took about four hours cover to cover) and fascinating as well.<br /><br />I was surprised at the limited detail about Dr Alexander's time in the 'hereafter'.  Perhaps he was intentional in keeping the detail of those experiences limited.  Most of what he discussed is high level and fairly common to many near death experiences  (feelings of intense love, vibrant lights, angelic entities).  What is unique is his assessment of those experiences as they play out against his lifeless body in the ICU.<br /><br />It is hard to argue against someone's personal experiences so debating whether or not this is true doesn't really matter.  He experienced it and is re-telling it.  He is not professing to be a prophet or channel or holy man.  The book is encouraging and uplifting.  I enjoyed reading it very much.
B0094BB4TW|1.0|as the reviwer below stated, this app no longer works. you get about 10 updates then a locked blue screen.  used to work great, please fix this.
0316228532|5.0|I am a huge Harry Potter fan, and had been looking forward to this book since the day I heard about it.  Then the book came out...I read the first 50 pages online, and thought it was just OK.  So I put my name on a hold list at the library and waited.  I came back to Amazon over and over and read the mixed reviews, and I expected to hate the book.  WOW, was I wrong!  It is superbly written!  Some of the subject matter is not for the faint of heart, and I don't know that I can really say that I \\"liked\\" the book, but I definitely appreciate the book.  JK Rowling really knows her stuff in terms of people, and how they think and act.  There is hardly a single likable character in the whole book, except for Barry.  I heard JK Rowling say she \\"needed\\" to write this book, so I could only imagine that she had a powerful message to convey.  She succeeded.
B008FOB124|3.0|This album sounds like it starts where DCD left off years ago, which fans may like.<br />I was expecting the music to be more interesting. I appreciate depressing, minor key music but it has to have something going on melodically.<br />Lisa Gerrard seems to have phoned it in. I wonder how much she actually contributed to this CD.<br />The last two songs start to measure up but by then it's too late.
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|As a teen boy in the 80's it was as though this book was written for me.  A compelling story, great characters, and a satisfying ending.  I didn't want the book to end. I hope Hollywood one day can do this book justice.
B002RI97IY|5.0|This book should be a set work book for every learner at every school...EVERYONE IN THE WORLD NEEDS TO READ THIS BOOK!!!!!!! I give a copy with every gift I give, you should too...
B005BCE7FQ|5.0|My almost 2-year-old LOVES this movie.  The music and graphics are amazing and the story line is very cute.  I even enjoy watching it with her :)<br />This is the only movie she will watch from start to finish.<br />We have only used the Blu-Ray disc so far, but plan to watch in 3D soon.  I will update my review when we finally get around to breaking out the 3D glasses!<br /><br />Bottom line: this movie is fun, colorful, and has upbeat music.  We'll be watching it again and again.
030758836X|4.0|I HAVE BEEN WAITING FOR A GOOD BOOK THAT KEEPS ME TURNING THE PAGES ND THIS WAS IT.  THE REASON I GAVE IT 4 STARS IS IT TAKES A WHILE TO GET USED TO THE BACK AND FORTH IN CHARACTERS.  ALSO, IN THE BEGINNING I THOUGHT , WHY IS THIS BOOK GIVEN SUCH GREAT REVIEWS.  ONCE YOU GET INTO IT , IT BECOMESA PAGE TURNER AND U UNDERSTAND WHY THE AUTHOR TOOK HER TIME SETTING YOU UP
B00004Z4WQ|4.0|Okay, it's corny with bad acting bordering on ridiculous, but it's funny! It's raunchy with some crude lines and touches on the offensive. If this hasn't turned you off to the movie, I think you'll actually like it like I do. Just put aside all your inhibitions and enjoy this true parody of slasher movies of the 90's era.<br /><br />I've watched this movie many times and decided to buy it (used). Watching it now again on DVD I am better able to catch some scenes and background funnies I missed before. Also, the DVD has a few cool deleted scenes and movie details I found interesting.<br /><br />Anyway, for a few dollars, I am happy to have this movie in my collection.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|Since it has been updated a few times it hasn't been giving me any problems and now I can happily use it when I don't have my kindle with me.
B007TNQ7EY|4.0|I think this game is  awesome. It feel's good knowing that I can play an action game on my kindle  rather than in a p.c. or  console. I can play this for hours and hours!! Great job on creating this application G.L. Keep the role-playing apps. coming.
B003N7ORNI|3.0|The Kane chronicals are about egyption gods, instead of greek gods. I can tell you one thing, only buy this book if you were a real fan of percy jackson, otherwise ou might as well get the percy jackson series rather than the kane chronicals as I find percy jackson a much better book.
B007IXWL2C|1.0|Not even sure how I made it through the first two pathetic books.  Not worth my time.  Quit half way through.  There is so much quality literature out there to invest time in reading.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|fun game. you don't need to use real money to play. once you use your coins you can either trade in your collected prides for coins or wait a few hours and you'll have coins again.
B0063IH60K|5.0|This has such nice action in the play, it makes Solitaire a much more entertaining game. The customization settings are wonderful as well. There is an option to switch to left hand play. Very cool.
B0052RDHTM|3.0|I did not expect the book to spend so much time on WWI and I was lost many times in trying to follow what the different govt's were doing and why.  I was looking forward to hearing the stories about the different families, but I did not enjoy following along with the war and got bored with the book.  I see the 2nd book starts about 1935 and have decided not to buy it.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|I really got a kick out of reading all of the reviews! (Can be more entertaining than the book itself!)I think people over-analyze books. If you can \\"get into it\\" and feel like it's \\"real,\\" then it's a good book. I did get into the characters of this book. This book reminded me of incidences of my own life (not quite as kinky) but none-the-less disturbing: Young girl wanting love. Hoping that the man will love her too.He gently leads her on to be hopeful. Not listening to what he's saying because she's in love. He only wants control and sex....(Been there/done that.) Past the half way point, the naughty talk and kinky stuff lost its \\"shock value\\" and just became boring. If they knocked off a hundred pages of sexual redundancy, I would have given it 5 stars.
B004PYDBVM|5.0|this is the second book i\\"ve read about north korea,the first being escape from  camp 14.both books are excellent.can't believe human beings surviving under such harsh & cruel living conditions under such a brutal dictatorship.
0525953728|4.0|As a retired US Naval Officer with 14 years of prior enlisted service I found this book to be very down to earth and factually to the point.  It is a crying shame that someone can devote their life to serving and defending this nation and then to have to sit back and remain silent while civilian government officals take political credit for accomplishing the mission.  I was impressed with the author's sincerity and his efforts to acknowledge his teammates, but also his guts to stand up to the establishment,tell what really happened,identified those who truly deserved the country's acknowledgement and gratitude.  Salute to you Shipmate!
030758836X|5.0|Love, lies, hatred, murder...Page after page, anxiously awaiting to see what would happen next.<br />Boy vs Girl, Man vs Woman.<br />Great read!
B005LAJ1O0|4.0|I thought this show was unique and disturbing.  The whole show made me uneasy all the way through.  I had a hard time warming up to the family, but did eventually (the mom was kind of a snob, especially towards Jessica Lange's character).  The flashbacks to prior murders in the home were unsettling (although sometimes derivitive).  I didn't always like their music choices. (The Twisted Nerve song I thought was misplaced.  I don't think it should have been used because it's a song that almost feels specific to Kill Bill.  I immediately thought of Kill Bill and Darryl Hannah walking down the hallway in the nurse's uniform when they showed the boy walking down the hallway of his school. Probably a song that really shouldn't be used in a movie or show again...)  There were some things that I'm not sure were inconsistencies or something I just missed (I only watched the series once through), particularly the history between Jessica Lange and the maid (**SPOILER**:  Why was the maid the only one that aged?  And what happened to Lange's husband who was shot? Maybe someone could reply and explain **END SPOILER**).  I would recommend this to people who are open to a show that is more of a disturbing tale rather than something you'd consider scary. Oh, and also someone who isn't turned off by more-or-less aberrant sexual content.
0143119680|5.0|I loved this book.  Ms. Harkness has created a wonderful fantasy world of witches, vampires, and daemons, who live alongside humans, for the most part undetected.  It's a long book, but it kept me turning pages into the wee hours, and I am eager to read the sequel(s).  Her heroine is Diana Bishop, descended from the Salem Bishops, and a very powerful witch, though she has tried not to use her magic and is unaware of how much power she actually has.  This book tells how she meets her true love, a vampire (horrors!), and starts to learn how to use her magic and witchcraft.  Ms. Harkness addresses common vampire lore and even gives a sly nod to Anne Rice in her narrative.<br /><br />I wish this book were an accurate depiction of the world and its creatures instead of a work of fantasy - it would explain a lot!
B009KHDT0C|4.0|The movie was entertaining.  There was a lot of great humor, albeit rather dry.  You could watch it twice, but it will never be a classic . . .
B0049J3QF4|5.0|Pixar is always so creative!! I'd recommend this to anybody who wants to have a good night with their family, somebody who wants to give their kids something to watch, or just somebody who wants to be entertained in general!!
B008ACC9CM|1.0|I am very dissapointed.<br />When I first heard them sing on Britain's got talent, I was amazed.<br /><br />There seems to be a sound engineering problem on this CD, Jonathan sounds like he is singing to a microphone across the room.<br /><br />To make sure, I compared to them on youtube, with same sound system.<br />VERY big difference! It should be better on the CD, yet here it is the other way around.<br />So much that the CD is not nice to listen to. I listened to 3 songs from the CD and turned it off.<br /><br />http://www.amazon.com/Together-Jonathan-Charlotte/product-reviews/B008ACC9CM/ref=dp_top_cm_cr_acr_txt?ie=UTF8&showViewpoints=1

B008ANFRGQ|5.0|This is the first Steve Vai CD I have bought and...I am hooked! The hard rock songs on this CD are so powerful it is amazing. I am wondering if it should be called hard rock - Steve sounds like he should have his own catagory much the way Beethoven has compared to other composers. I also love the hard soul of John the Revalator and Book of the Seven Seals. Judging from this CD Steve has a great musical imagination and he can do anything with a guitar that he wants, from making it sound soft and sweet to wonderfully nasty. I look forward to getting his other CDs.
B009HQ9UHC|5.0|u have to make car with 3 boxes in a row then 2 wheels on the ends bottom then add the pop rocket at the end of the car all u do is fire it up then do nothing just wait it'll make u get the level 3 stars BUT IT TAKES 2 OR 3 SHORT TRYS
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|i really enjoyed playing this game. it has great graphics and a strong story line. i'm waiting for the second one.
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|This in one of the best hidden object games that I have played. Good story line,  great graphics and good puzzles. For the most part it is challenging without being too difficult. It gives you plenty of play time and well worth the money. I am definitely getting Enigmatis2 when it is available.
B000SEGUDE|1.0|I'm sorry but I'm half way through the book and I'm lost.  There's a few minor hints about the effects of each life to the subsequent one, but right now, I'm finding it difficult to get the gist of the story.<br /><br />As I said, I'm just about half way through so maybe it will hit me.  Anyone reading this, please don't beat up on me.  You may love this book but I've had to read and re-read several sections and wasn't sure I got what was going on.
B009HSVHV2|1.0|I am a big kiss fan but this record is very boring.  I am very disappointed. Not sure how Paul can say it is so great. Sonic Boom was much better.
