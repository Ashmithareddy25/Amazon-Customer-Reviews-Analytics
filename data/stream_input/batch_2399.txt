B005ZCXPP0|5.0|I have always been a fan of all the old Marvel Comic Books heros and will continue to collect them all.
B005MYEQ4U|4.0|A very clever film coming from a very clever director. I do believe that everybody sometime in his/her life wanted to know Scott Fitzgerald, Hemingway, Picasso, and so on. The performance of the main actor is excellent. In a way he remember me W.Allen himself. In fact when you write or you paint or create whatever the nostalgia shop is truly necessary but even when you go somewhere all the past that you deeply love emerges without thinking.<br />Ivonne-from Uruguay
B0042TV4IW|5.0|Relaxing, quaint stories from the past. Actors are wonderful and this takes me back to a time of my own childhood being raised out in the country even though it wasn't THAT far back...
B0018RFLQ2|5.0|Both my husband and I regard this as one of our all-time favorite movies.  The theme is timeless -- father and son relationships, competition, father glorying in the son's achievements as a chess prodigy.  The acting is superb throughout.  Beautifully filmed, excellent pace.  Definitely a &#34;feel good&#34; movie.
B0063M22QO|5.0|I enjoy all kinds of Mahjong games.  I can buy them all, and never get tired of playing all them.
B0073COMKW|4.0|These bulbs are great.  I enjoy the light they emit.  Terrific value too! I will get more of these as needed in the future.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Best game I have played. Love the format and set up. I play for hours at a time. I am totally addicted. This is the best version I have played. I no longer play the other versions.
1582701709|5.0|If you are interested in the law of attraction, this is a must read for a greater spiritual understanding.  Loved it.
B00BGIC2J2|1.0|While this movie was kinda funny in places, it was also very irreverent as well. The irreverent parts of the movie turned my stomach and do not make it worth it. Marriage is precious and there are seasons of highs and lows. Low times are not times for spending lots of money, doing drugs, and going out to clubs. What a horrible message to put out there. What a hopeless mess.
B0053Q9DHW|5.0|I've read Jane Eyre multiple times and have seen a great many of the film and tv versions, from the Welles 1941 take to the relatively recent Masterpiece Theater mini series. I have to say I found this version with Mia Wasikowska and Michael Fassbender absolutely sublime - it's both passionate and subtle and holds up extremely well over many viewings. I also feel that the lack of melodrama, along with an elevated aesthetic (cinematography and music), will turn this into a classic that will hold up beautifully over time - it won't appear dated, there's nothing mawkish in its delivery. Wasikowska (a perfect Jane) is a tremendously talented young actress, so brilliant and different in her wide-ranging roles, and Fassbender has the charisma and great skill to provide the perfect pairing with her compelling, enigmatic presence (a passionate blend of strength and vulnerability) in contrast to his fierce pride and wounded soul. Both actors are two of the best currently working in film, and the young director Carey Fukunaga, who made such a splash with True Detective, reveals that he is a filmmaker of great intelligence and taste, one of the most promising of his generation. I find this film fascinating and it delivers for me emotionally with every viewing - its nuance and authenticity are great strengths, and it respects the intelligence of the audience, something I really appreciate. There are a few films that I find myself returning to, feeling there's more to discover, this wonderful adaptation of Jane Eyre is in that category - it's one of my personal favorites. I love &#34;Jane Eyre&#34;, the book, as a classic piece of literature, and I love &#34;Jane Eyre&#34; (2011), the film, as a beautiful piece of cinema - both are timeless and will continue to thrill and enlighten for generations to come.
0765325950|5.0|I didn't dislike anything about this book. It was a good read and kept me reading more and more. The book came in hardback and was in excellent shape. It shipped fast. I would order again from this seller so I rate it a 5 for overall great experience.
B0095ZQ36G|5.0|Great book on WWII that gives perspectives from both sides. Excellent for history buffs too. You will enjoy this book!
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|What wonderful entertainment! It is very intriguing. I love it that this story is historical--I am learning a little while I watch. This is not a show only for old retired women. I am  in my 20's and I and all of my friends love it! You will not be disappointed. Make sure you start with season 1. You will be lost otherwise.
B00A77II0U|5.0|Finding objects and having to go back and forth through the game is great!  Loved it!  Enjoy hidden objects with puzzles.
0061122416|5.0|This book causes serious self reflection. I had to read this book for a class, actually a business class, and it has parallels to all different aspects of life. I really like the spiritual awakening aspect of this book since i am religious and seek towards spirituality and to better myself. Not too long of a read either.
1476719071|4.0|This book was so much fun to read and definitely different then the usual cookie cutter romance story. Yes at times the story took unrealistic turns (I am really trying to understand why so many of these type of books always have the ending that they do)and was a bit much, but the writer's skill in telling the story and giving her character's life is definitely there. And let's be honest here no one is reading this book to have a life changing literary experience, you're reading it because it's a nice break from reality. You get pulled into Abby and Travis's dysfunctional, hilarious, often times serious (and come one for some reason if it's not dysfunctional it's not as interesting) but romantic relationship and you can understand why they are such a beautiful disaster. Like one other reviewer mentioned I like that they built up the tension between the character, but was also disappointed with the ending. All in all though for a fun read on the beach or at the pool this summer I would recommend this book. :)
B007F1SGM6|5.0|Director Stephen Daldry (&#34;Billy Elliot,&#34; &#34;The Hours&#34;) gathers his powers once again to portray a child's experience uniquely and strongly. Although the 9/11 subject is always difficult to revisit, this film gives it whatever meaning it can have. Thomas Horn's performance is perfectly drawn, and at no time does it seem anything but completely real. We watched this film with our 14 year old &#34;spectrumy&#34; son, and it was remarkably moving and worthwhile.
0374275637|5.0|A must read for anyone who likes psychoanalysis of decision making and perception with case studies to back it up. Plenty to think about here at over 400 pages long. Very well written and enjoyable to read if you like understanding psychological, statistic and/or economic. I highly recommend this book.
B00BLCHYKU|5.0|I love that the History Channel is creating a blend of Historically significant events with some &#34;HBO-esque&#34; action/drama.  I highly recommend!
B00BB8RKH6|5.0|This was a sobering and honest protrayal of the real life dilemmas of addictive an self destructive behavior.Danzel did a superb job, very sensitive and gut wrenching performance.
B00BHMETKC|4.0|it was okay--good, even.  but, certainly not the best movie i've ever seen. actors were great.  I think it was the storyline.....really didn't develop the characters who were hostages (who were real people, for goodness sake).
B003V6L94Q|5.0|I really love this battery. It lasts almost 4 hours without a charge...better than any yet. Thanks you very much!
B00C1BU7V8|2.0|The movie was very slow. The only reason I gave it 2 stars instead of 1 is that if you didn't know what the 13th amendment is you will after watching. The movie painted the picture as if the civil war was about slavery, which it was not.
B000FP2OPY|3.0|The premise of this show is not bad. Two brothers whose job it is to hunt supernatural demons, ghosts, spirits, etc.. Each episode has a new incident and a new mystery to solve. The writers are fairly creative in coming up with new monsters to kill each week. The show mixes mystery and suspense which I like. I do not like shows that rely solely on suspense to keep the audience entertained (\\"How are they going to get out of this?\\"). I like there to be some mystery (\\"What is really going on here?\\") otherwise I tend to get bored. Before they kill the demons or ghosts, Dean and Sam usually have to figure out what is actually going on, and having that mystery helps keep me interested.<br /><br />There are two other quick things I want to praise about the show before offering a few complaints. First, the production values are quite good. The special effects are all well done. Bad production values on a show about the supernatural can really pull you out of the show, but I have never been pulled out of this show by the thought \\"That looked stupid\\". Second, the show creates a good atmosphere. The color palette is very dark and grey. The hunters tend to be grizzled and unshaven (including Dean and Sam's father). I have to give the show credit for capturing what I think is the appropriate atmosphere for a show about demon hunting.<br /><br />However, the writing leaves a lot to be desired in a number of important respects. First, the fact that the show is about demons and ghosts and other supernatural creatures gives the writers a lot of free rein to just invent their way out of problems. It is like the writers write themselves into corners (\\"How are Dean and Sam going to get out of this one?\\") and then just invent some \\"fact\\" about the demon or ghost they are fighting to get them out (\\"I know, what if the demon they are fighting is killed by light, etc.\\"). The solution often seems very contrived and invented for a very specific purpose (to get Dean and Sam out of a bind).<br /><br />Second, the characters are sort of boring. Dean and Sam are the typical, archetypal brothers. The extroverted man of action, who loves fast cars, and never questions authority (Dean), and the introverted intellectual, who reads books, and is constantly questioning authority (Sam). There is nothing wrong with those archetypes. They have been used for centuries to great effect. The problem is, the characters never really get beyond the familiar tropes, and achieve the status of genuine individuality. Think, for example, about how interesting Fox Mulder was as a character, and compare that to the characters in this show. I do not think this show holds up well under the comparison.<br /><br />The characters lack depth and complexity. Sam and Dean are both way too noble. They lack moral complexity. They are constantly beating themselves up for making honest mistakes, for failing to save someone through no fault of their own (\\"I should have been able to save her!\\"). They are always more than willing to die (literally) to save others. These are admirable qualities, but it would be nice to see a few genuine faults, and some genuine moral complexity. I get tired of watching perfect characters berate themselves about the outcome of some event that was totally out of their control. As if their inability to predict the future, or perfectly control the course of the world, were a moral failing.<br /><br />Third, a lot of the drama of the show is extremely repetitive and sentimental. Dean and Sam have the same argument over and over and over. In virtually every episode Dean and Sam get into the same argument about their father, or about Sam wanting to lead his own life etc., and then it gets resolved in a very sentimental way. I get annoyed with shows like this because things never progress. The argument never gets anywhere. They reach some new understanding at the end of an episode (Sam realizes he was being too hard on his father, Dean admits that he admires his brothers independence, etc.), but then the next episode they are right back where they started, having the same exact argument. The arguments between Dean and Sam are probably the most tiresome part of the show, and they get worse in the second season.<br /><br />Fourth, there is a familiar trope that is used a lot in this show: the hero (usually Dean) and the villain (usually a demon in the form of a beautiful woman) meet face to face and engage in a verbal repartee. They go back and forth using that sarcastic tone of voice that is supposed to be clever and slightly menacing at the same time (Demon: \\"Oh, its so good to see you, Dean. How's your father?\\" Dean: \\"I should send you to hell\\" Demon: \\"Now that's not very nice\\", etc.). There are entire scenes where all the dialogue is in that annoying sarcastic tone of voice, plus, the scenes are poorly written and usually poorly acted as well. The same goes for the emotional monologues, which tend to be overly sappy and sentimental. The writing on this show, in general, is just not that great.<br /><br />All that having been said, the show can be entertaining. So, whether or not you will like it will depend on how you feel about the criticisms I mentioned. Some people do not care that much about contrived writing, cliched characters, or repetitive drama. If those kinds of things are not that important to you I would recommend giving this show a try. If your main interest is in horror and suspense then this is a pretty good show and you will almost certainly be entertained. If the things I mentioned are important to you I would recommend watching this one for free before buying it. I would also recommend checking out The X-Files, Buffy the Vampire Slayer, or Veronica Mars first if, for some strange reason, you have not watched those shows yet. They are all, in my opinion, a lot better than this show.rs independence, etc.), but then the next episode they are right back where they started, having the same exact argument.

B001OQCV6A|5.0|I bought this for my son for an easter basket stuffer.  We had seen it at the show and just wanted to own it.  It shipped in a timely fashion and was exactly as described.
B000UNYJV8|5.0|Neither for the squeamish nor those who choose to see the problems of racism as in decline, \\"This is England\\" places at the forefront of its subject matter a Thatcherite England dealing with the struggles of classism, racism, and a society that has turned upon itself.  This story is wrought with violence and humanity, with characters that subvert the classic image of an ideal potential existence and, thus, in a sense we are all doomed to commit some sin (post-lapsarian maybe?).  While characters can never achieve a perfection, they can, and do, achieve a chilling potential for evil.<br /><br />Superbly shot and acted, this movie is great.
B00005RHGL|5.0|I love this movie so I had to have this special collection!  Great movie, great product!!  This is a movie I love watching over and over again, it doesn't get old!
B00BJDARGO|2.0|I don't know if the the picture quality worth to get it on BD instead of DVD,but regarding the sound quality it clearly doesn't.<br /><br />Not even any DTS.<br /><br />This is a fraud.<br /><br />2 stars because i love Whitesnake.<br /><br />Since Whitesnake works with Frontiers records,every quality release suck.<br /><br />P.S.:Sorry,i don't speak english fluently
B007K3JFUQ|5.0|I bought this for a easter basket stuffer for my son.  We had already seen it at the show, but wanted to own it.  It shipped in a timely fashion and was exactly as described.
B008KUM95G|5.0|i could read this again and again. brilliant writing. it will never get old.<br /><br />also recommend, &#34;Joy in the Morning&#34; also titled &#34;Jeeves in the Morning&#34;
B000JMLDCS|3.0|Chesterton does a good job of bringing out his own path to rediscovering the faith. However, I think chapter 1 should have been struck out -- a long-winded tangent of background information that he concludes with an apology to the reader. He further tangents and even jabs back at his critics in later chapters but I believe his arguments to be sound. A few very excellent quotes.
B0046B3QTG|5.0|Has a good message for kids, and very entertaining for adults. Highly recommend for a good afternoon with your family.
B0049J0CTM|5.0|In this film the Lead Character watches as his wife is brutally murdered by a serial killer that leaves his new born son physically disabled. Then in a more tragic turn of events his son is kidnapped. The father must now follow the trail over thousand of miles with only a mentally handicapped woman along to help. But the end of the movie more than makes up for any shortcomings throughout and the improbability of story. Finding Neno is a modern classic in the vein of Taken. Well worth the watch.
B003L77G06|5.0|This show is so well-written and funny; it's tough to even choose a favorite character because they are all hilariously dysfunctional.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|excellent, excellent. a fantastic read and a real look behind what some people live with and overcome.  I highly recommend it
B008602KQI|4.0|There's plenty to complain about when it comes to any adaptation, but overall it was a fun movie to watch.
B005K17RU0|1.0|Previous version was perfect!  The latest version was so bad I deleted it. Please go back to the old format.
B000GW8RX4|3.0|The disk is good but it did not blow me away like I thought Dio, Blackmore and Powell would.<br />I'll have to watch it again sometime for another opinion. I was looking at the clock.<br /><br />I like &#34;the hits&#34;, Long Live Rock n Roll and Man on the Silver Mountain but the rest of it did not do much<br />for me. And I'm a big Dio fan and a fan of Cozy's drumming but the disk left me a little flat.
B001HNE3NO|5.0|excellent, excellent.  Sad in its background story, but tremendously uplifting as it proceeds into the present.  I highly recommend it.
B00258SS72|5.0|This is a great movie....and should be rated as much.  I wish the language was not rated R because I would love to show it to my grandsons.  It is a good family movie - something we can all learn from.  Prejudice is wrong regardless and it goes to show how someone can learn from their mistakes.
B00821OX98|5.0|A very interesting story that keeps you wanting more... Its one of those stories that actually make you think if there are really any other life forms out there and if so, will they be hostile?
B000000OQF|5.0|I'm not a huge GNR fan but their first and best album is an all time classic.<br />Just a great rock-n-roll album. I cannot add any more to whats already been said about this album.<br />It's a classic and everyone should have a copy of Apetitie in their collection.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|excellent, excellent reading. One can definitely asssociate with all the characters and the paths their lives take.  Sad and finally uplifting.  I highly recommend it.
B009O07NDY|5.0|I really enjoy hearing all of the cast bonus songs. The background music makes me remember the scenes in the film, so that makes me really happy. No disc problems either. Also, the art included is really cool.
B0012GTZC0|5.0|I have become a fan of Ken Follett because his books are really hard to put down. Great characters and story line.
B008DM4OTA|5.0|Love this for my daughter.  I originally got the free version and loved it so much that I got the full version for my daughter!!
B0034DGPEU|5.0|At times it was hurtful to read about the degradation suffered by southern slaves; but a wonderful well-written book overall.
B0040HO01Y|5.0|I love this series!  The casting, the scenery, the dialectrs, the foibles of the characters----all so marvelously British. After each episode we are eager for the next one.
B004NELBPC|1.0|Reading HP daily has been a ritual, until this latest update. The fonts are miniscule...even with my reading glasses!  Fix this quick guys cause you're gonna loose readers like me.
B00BHBBSZ2|3.0|The Handrite Notepad does exactly as advertised - I am retired and enjoy trying new computer products but I have no practical need for this item. I was experimenting with the Notepad on my Kindle Fire (that I really enjoy) and could not find fault with the product but as stated early that are many more ways of taking notes than using this application.
B005K17RU0|5.0|Better graphics and a more intuitive layout than the previous version. Loads up quickly when signal strength is good. Multiple locations feature is nice.
B009UAO1ZG|5.0|A fascinating account of the chaos, intrigue, and feuding between interventionists and isolationists leading up to World War II. Includes the acrimonious feud between Interventionist Franklin Roosevelt and Isolationist Charles Lindbergh.
886613077X|2.0|So I guess I'm at fault for not reading the comments or the dimensions right, but this planner is way to small for practical use. I thought about returning it but decided to give it a try, and couldn't find it useful for even a week. It's so small it's very difficult to write more than two to-do items per day. I say it's about smaller than an iPhone to put it into perspective.
B008EU4YXC|4.0|This book  worths all the positive feedback, that has been written!  New and different look at one sensibile historical period!
B008P3SPVU|5.0|This movie was so inspirational based on courage and teaching people lessons about life and priorities. Samuel Jackson was awesome, a must watch!!
B008IBPMZG|5.0|amazon prime is great! i totally forgot that i got videos along with my membership and now we are watching this great show on the amazon xbox app! characters are so in-depth and plot keeps me on my toes.
B0031RAOW8|5.0|This movie has so much heart. I don't want to give away anything at all..it's a must see, but bring the tissue box!
B000HF0ILY|5.0|I really enjoyed Pale Rider, it's one of my favorite Clint Eastwood  Westerns. If u love westerns this ones for u!!
B00ANVX6DY|5.0|Bought this for my daughter and she loves it. Has already watched it several times. Any little girl would love this litle movie.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Such a great start. About to start the second book and cannot wait to see how Grey and Ana develop this relationship. Such an addiction!!
B004HWYTP4|5.0|It was hilarious.  All great actors.  We watched it twice and found more to laugh at both times.  Don't usually like Bruce Willis.
B009KS4XRO|3.0|Fun but there are way too many issues with the app ans support is hard to get a response from.
B0064X7FVE|2.0|I like The Weather Channel app in general however the previous version what's more intuitive and easier to use. I like to revert to the previous version
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|if you like the movie then you will deffinatly like this game.. it really shows you some of the true stuff you will find under the water.
B0084BMUFA|4.0|A Christmas Carol, a traditional story. It is a bit hard to read in the old English. I think it is important to read the classic to keep us grounded in excellent writing.
B00985E3UG|5.0|Made me change threats I look at food. Author did a great job laying out information without sounding like a textbook.
B0000AM6IY|5.0|Natalie Wood was at her lovliest and at the peak of her stardom when she starred in West Side Story. One of the best musicals ever made. Fabulous support comes from Rita Moreno, and George Chakiris who both won supporting Oscars for their roles. I enjoyed seeing this in revival in a theatre. The best way to see it. Anyone can enjoy this great film.
B000FA675C|5.0|I read the book in hard cover and was surprised the things I missed.  It not only an enjoy it was a religous histery gold mine.
B009UNGYHG|5.0|I used all the best you can name. It is paramount to use a earpiece in my line of work. The piece actually works with me, triaging calls. The hands off is reliable and effective.
B007H7XRLI|5.0|Full of non stop action. I just love this genre. I have always had an interest in the gods. To see them all star in this movie<br />Was simply marvelous. The storyline was amazing was right on and I could not take my eyes off the movie. I am a movie collector and only buy movies that are full of action, and movies I would like to see over and over again. This movie is one of them.
B00006DEF9|5.0|Debbie got the MGM buildup big time in this as  L. B. Mayer decreed. It was worth it. Singin' In The Rain became one of the best films ever made, musical or otherwise. I loved seeing this in a revival at the theatre. The best place to enjoy it. Gene Kelly and Donald O'Connor were the superb co-stars. You can watch this film with anybody.
B00BF11STU|3.0|I realize this was supposed to be an AAA title, so I wouldn't expect a short movie, but there was a lot of embellishment of the story that made it feel pretty slow throughout. Until the end of course, which was pretty intense for obvious reasons. I found myself clenching my teeth during the breech even though I have already seen the made for TV version and knew somewhat what to expect.<br /><br />All the actors were spot on, but honestly I didn't find this to be any better than Seal Team Six: The Raid on Osama Bin Laden, which was also very well done.<br /><br />It was fun to see Chris Pratt in a not-so-comedic role also- he is great :)
B004D2A04M|3.0|The only problem that I found is the clip. It is not as secure as advertised. The holster has fallen from my belt twice , on both occasions when I got out of the car. Now I am extra careful
B008N1LL42|5.0|It's Battleship, I played this game as a teenager. For Hasbro to make it into a movie was fantastic. When the Allens<br />sunk the first ship, I hollered, &#34;YOU SUNK MY BATTLESHIP&#34;. Well I also purchased the DVD and I think it should have<br />been the movie of the year.
B005S9EKCW|5.0|We love this movie. It has a great plot and we were in love with the older Broadway productions. Exceeded expectation.
B00C1C0WCQ|1.0|I rented this movie for an eight year boy to watch. After watching it, I am convinced it was written by an eight year old boy. Horrible script! Ridiculous dinosaurs! Stay away unless you are an eight year old.
B009IUH1N2|4.0|I enjoy playing this game and dreaming that one day I might have moves like Ninja Joe.  The game play is simple and fun; however, I did find it easier to play if my phone/tablet was resting on a table or desk.  It is a good game to practice your hand & eye coordination as timing is essential.
B007Y36K46|5.0|Well I have fallen in love with Taylor Kitsch. He is John Carter in this movie.He really and truly played this role. I<br />remember learning about Edgar Rice Boroughs in Hough school. The storyline was amazing and the special f2f<br />was so real that it made you fee that those creatures in the movie truly exist.
B00BGIC2J2|1.0|Too bad the language had to ruin this movie....  The acting was also pretty terrible.  Was really looking forward to watching it, but couldn't even finish it. :(
B00BYKIKJS|5.0|The acting is superb.  The story is funny and heartwarming.  Take two less than normal 30 somethings that live in the same neighborhood at home with their parents, and take it from there.
B00BHMETKC|5.0|I enjoyed it because it was &#34;Go America&#34; kind of movie!! Love our country! Patriotic! Good wins over Evil. Yeah!!!
B005KB0SU6|5.0|Como el primero, lleno de suspenso,no podrás dejar de leerlo. Y voy por la siguiente entrega. Los recomiendo ampliamente. Bastante entretenidos.
B000QRIGLC|4.0|The descriptions of Marcus Luttrell going thru the initial training phase of becoming a Navy Seal are not only informative, however, you can't believe the endurance and torture it requires to make the grade as a Seal. While, that is harrowing enough, wait until you read what he and his teammates go thru in combat. It will bring tears to your eyes and make you beyond proud what our servicemen (and, women) do on our behalf. It is a very honest book and, he tells where mistakes were made fighting our enemies (and, there were decisions that cost lives). My only complaint is that the book is repetitive. That shouldn't be a surprise as he is not a professional writer. That is the only caveat which is a small reservation. Overall, this is a book that EVERYONE should read because of the immense sacrifices that our soldiers undergo to keep us all safe. They should be blessed.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Our whole family enjoys this. We've seen almost all the episodes and can't wait for time to see the rest.
B003S4G8RY|1.0|Apparently the format the blu-ray of Rec came in did not like my PS3 or my regular Sony blu-ray player. So I did not get to watch this movie at all and returned it for a refund.
1400067820|5.0|A writer knows he's made it when a term he's invented becomes a popular idiom. Even people with no idea who Nassim Taleb is will use \\"Black Swan\\" in sentences today to describe an unpredicted event that shakes the world.  Taleb coined that term in the title of his last book, and with \\"Antifragile\\" now he's come up with another word probably destined to get stuck in our lexicon with the same unnerving tenacity.  Taleb has a knack for giving a sudden clear voice to ideas that explain a lot but which heretofore had been floating around formlessly.<br /><br />  \\"Antifragile\\" is the quality inherent in certain things that not only makes them resistant to disorder but allows them to thrive on it and grow stronger. In Taleb's narrative, most antifragile systems are natural and unconscious, with evolution itself representing the epitome of the antifragility that has allowed life on Earth to progress in the face of natural chaos.<br /><br />  Taleb actually devotes most of his effort in this book, however, to talking about the opposite of antifragility. He hates fragility and dislikes the people who cause it.  Fragility arises when human beings stop coping pragmatically with the natural stresses in their environment and try to create unnatural carefree bubbles for themselves. Working as a Wall Street trader during the Alan Greenspan era, Taleb observed first-hand the manner in which the legendary Fed chairman responded to every hiccup in the financial markets with heavy doses of liquidity and ever-lower interest rates. Greenspan was lionized at the time for having \\"tamed\\" the business cycle and for creating what looked like an endless horizon of smooth business conditions and high investment returns. What he was in fact doing, in Taleb's way of thinking, was to vitiate restorative normal volatility and to lay groundwork for the crash of 2008 and the dismal aftermath with which we're still living today. \\"Fragilista\\" is the derisive term that Taleb applies to the human authors of fragility, and he singles out Greenspan as \\"the greatest Fragilista of all time.\\" Be that as it may, the gentleman has plenty of bad company in this book.<br /><br />  Anyone who picks up Antifragile with the idea it's a treatise primarily about market economics, however,  is going to be surprised.  While his erstwhile profession still provides Taleb with his central metaphors, he has by now moved beyond it and seemingly promoted himself into the ranks of the Great Philosophers. He sprinkles his text with the names of just about every ancient Greek and Roman philosopher and scientist most of us  ever heard of, along with those of medieval theologians and various Middle-Eastern authors most of us haven't. While apparently self-taught, Taleb is well-read. Being multi-lingual and having been born in Lebanon, of course, he is unassumingly cosmopolitan, and I don't find his displays of erudition in any way pretentious. It's just that he appears to be one of those writers who, having achieved sufficient renown, doesn't have to pay much attention to editors any more.  He rambles self-indulgently at times and takes the reader down many odd diversions, even as he pursues consistent lines of thought.<br /><br />  He is interested in biology and nutrition, finding in these fields natural expressions of his central ideas. The talks about the quirky nutritional regimen he applies to his own life, for example. He subjects himself at  random intervals to diets of sensitively balanced grains and veggies,  hardcore fasting and, occasionally, in his words, \\"high quantities of fatty red meat\\". Eschewing theory as he does, he doesn't really try to explain any of this but seems to regard irregular nutritional inputs as key to healthy living. Once again for him, comfortable patterns in life are the enemy of long-range survival.<br /><br />  He regards much of modern medical and pharmaceutical science as bunk, prone to overselling marginal benefits and ignoring murderous side effects.He's well-versed in statistical methods, and he slams the research  behind it all as being undermined by a combination of misread correlation and the self-interested bias of the medical community. He comes across like a country grandmother in his preference for old-fashioned remedies. Two of his favorite words in this book are (1) \\"iatrogenic\\", which refers to harm caused inadvertently by well-meaning doctors, and (2) \\"hormesis\\", which refers the body's natural healing power in response manageable levels of toxins or disease-causing agents. These words tie together several of Taleb's diverse threads, and he applies them with  caustic vigor in his critiques of both modern medical doctors and Harvard economists in their respective manias for curative intervention.<br /><br />  Taleb is hard to place politically.  His scorn for central planning and economic intervention in any form would seem to place him squarely on the hard conservative side of the spectrum. However, in his fury against bankers, military interventions,  Big Tobacco, Big Pharma and large corporations in general, he sounds like Michael Moore. I suppose that the people he's closest to would be the Libertarians, although I'm sure that he himself would resist even that label. He would point out that the detested Alan Greenspan calls himself a Libertarian, or at least once did. What Taleb really is, in my opinion, is an instinctive anarchist, albeit a gentle one without any violence about him whatsoever. I've seen him interviewed a couple of times, and for all his bookishness, he can come across as willfully and almost proudly inarticulate. For me, he brings to mind a bit the young Bob Dylan, who refused to engage with people he obviously did not respect and was forever parrying their questions with non sequiturs and obscure little parables. People like Dylan and Teleb don't like getting maneuvered  into boxes.<br /><br />  For all his eccentricities, let there be no mistake about it: Nassim Taleb has one of the more powerful minds at work today in the public domain. Like all original thinkers, he's developing a very small number of core ideas that he circles around repeatedly in an effort to tease out as much meaning as possible. I judge the power of a book largely by the length of time it stays lodged in my consciousness after I put it down. I finished this one a couple of weeks ago and still have not stopped thinking about it. I generally read with a pencil in my hand and underline passages that strike me as particularly cogent expressions of important ideas. Leafing back through my copy of Antifragile, I find many pages where a third of the text is underlined.<br /><br />  It's my belief that Taleb has placed his finger here one of the key dynamics that is driving contemporary events in the world: Efforts to micro-manage complex phenomena undermine natural processes and cause systemic breakdowns.

1439190275|2.0|I was on this diet years ago.  This book made it seem too complicated.  I found myself irritated a lot, trying to select foods, reading labels etc. and constantly having to scramble back through the book to make sure I was doing it right.  It would tell you to count everything and then tell you to not be obsessive.  I fear my eating of too much raw spinach may have caused kidney stones.

B006LSZECO|2.0|Once I finally got in to the book (which took a good 100+ pages) I still found that I was having to force myself to finish reading it. Yes, it does have some really great plots & such but the end sealed the deal for me. Worst ending to a book this complex EVER. I would not recommend.

B00364K6YW|5.0|This is my favorite version of Pride and Prejudice out there.  It is a longer version as it is an A&E mini-series so they were able to expand on parts of the book that don't usually go into the movies.  I have bought this for a few of my friends.

B008Y7N7JW|4.0|At the beginning of the movie I thought it looked a little weird and I wasn't sure what was actually going on. But after about 10 minutes I caught on, and from there enjoyed the rest of the movie. Kind of a gladiator movie set in the future, would be my take if someone ask me what type of movie it is.
B005S9EKCW|5.0|All of the actors in this movie do a great job of portraying the tale to you.  It was very moving and the singing was fantastic.

I was afraid to read this last edition because of all the hate the ending is getting.I LOVE this series and was scared it ended as badly as everyone said it did. Trust me, if you truly understand the series and the world in it, you will possibly love this ending.<br /><br />This ending was just perfect for me. I cried in the end of every book in this series (especially Delirium) and was not dry eyed by the end of Requiem.t by the editors also bothered me.<br /><br />This ending was just perfect for me.

B000Y0Q5NM|5.0|So many series on television tend to become cliche and formulaic over time. Thankfully, Stargate SG-1 was not one of those programs. The acting, directing, and writing improved every season over what had come before. The action is more intense and the human side of the drama is explored more deeply.
B002IFT1ZA|5.0|This is such a fun series and close to the books.  There are a few things that are different, but the acting and all the effects make this a great series to watch.
006117758X|5.0|Bukowski is raw, unfiltered, and hilarious. Will definitely look into reading more of his other works. Definitely not recommended for too young of a reader though.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|The Acting and the Writing are spot on.  You really come to care for all the characters. It is also rather addicting :-)

B008JFUO4U|3.0|Oblivion (2013) - Tom Cruise, Olga Kurylenko, Andrea Riseborough, Morgan Freeman, Melissa Leo and Nikolaj Coster-Waldau<br /><br />Premise: After an alien invasion, the Earth has been left a nuclear wasteland. Survivors gather aboard the TET in preparation to leave to a new colony on Titan. Before they can make the journey, resources such as water need to be harvested if there's to be any chance for survival: Enter Jack Harper, Tech 49 (Tom Cruise), who with his partner Victoria (Andrea Riseborough) protect drones designed to find and kill \\"Scavs\\" - the remnant alien survivors of the invasions who carry out attacks on the resource gatherers. When a mysterious woman (Olga Kurylenko) crash lands on the planet though, everything Jack thought he knew is called into question...<br /><br />Thoughts: High definition brought out the best in this visually arresting film. The musical score (by M83) is intense, awesome but, at times, a bit overpowering/jarring in certain sequences. The acting is very well done, but unfortunately the film's script and story lacks the calibre of its talent. The story meanders, there are nonsensical plot twists which are not explored for anything but shock value. As a result, at times the film can be quite frustrating. Additionally, not all the characters are developed well - specifically Nikolaj Coster-Waldau's supporting character who - though bad ass - doesn't get developed beyond \\"bad ass with long hair and a gun.\\" But each actor does their best to bring something to the table and it shows - though it isn't enough to cover the plot holes and lack of development at times.<br /><br />Should you buy this film: My experience was watching the film in true IMAX. As such, the visuals were incredible - if you have a High Def television and a surround sound system, then I definitely recommend this film on bluray. Anything less, you're being robbed. At the same time: this film is NOT on the same level as a smaller indie film which covers a lot of the same ground in different ways. If you're looking for quality science fiction, I recommend Duncan Jones' Moon starring Sam Rockwell. However, if you're looking for a beautifully shot action adventure film with a great soundtrack, Oblivion would probably be a good call.ame ground in different ways.

B0050R0XEG|5.0|Son loves this set....he's clicking away...arrived quickly in excellent condition.  This set is very detailed and looks great once completed.
B00C7KYXHW|5.0|Excellent acting and production.  I like the way they have the main character imagine how a crime was committed.  Very compelling.  I'm glad to see Hugh Dancy get a role that shows off his talent.  This first episode was very intense to me, so I would say the show is not for the faint of heart.
B004Q3UL56|5.0|Thought it was funny and sweet. Normally I hate Anne Hathaway, but she wasn't terrible in this movie. When I couldn't stand to look at her anymore I just looked at her beautiful hair in the movie!
B004HW7JH4|5.0|Definitely the best season of Mad Men to date. Who knew it could get even better than stellar? Can't wait for Season Six!
B007GEMQ2I|5.0|The set arrived promptly and securely shipped.  My son loved building this set.  The more detailed and number of pieces the more hee likes it.  Great Set! Looks amazing once completed.
B000002GFC|4.0|This CD has a good collection of their hits including, sunshine of your love, white room, strange brew.  I like the old clapton guitar solos.
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|I would definitely recommend reading the book first as it will give good insight into Catnis' inner dialogue while in the Games.
B005OT2YVA|3.0|This, like the other two, had the action and explosions you would expect from Michael Bay minus the substance. I never really cared for the characters. Was never really givin a good reason to care. But the explosions fed my ADD and the result is the 3 star rating.

B000LB7G00|5.0|If you ever wanted or needed the ability to control your 3D objects... move thru Google Earth, 2nd Life, Maya, etc.. This puppy is for you!  PC/Mac A-OK.  Works like a champ.  The Major difference between the SpaceNavigator and the Notebook version simply is this one is bigger, heavier, a bit more robust.  The one for the notebooks are smaller, lighter, and though it comes with a suction-cup, I like to have something I can not have to worry about lifting off the table... Since I'm already using a 9.4lbs+ laptop, the extra weight of the desktop SpaceNavigator does not bother me, where as the notebook version is slightly: smaller, lighter and comes with a carrying case.<br /><br />Bottom line.. BUY IT.. you'll be glad you did!
0060763280|4.0|I took a Harv Ecker free intensive seminar back in 2006 and the memories still linger. It was real good stuff.<br />His book is great specially if one is careful to apply some wealth administration concepts within.<br /><br />Thanks Harv<br />AAA

B0078XGEK2|4.0|This is an excellent book. I have meant to read it many years ago and wish that I had done it..
B000021XS0|4.0|I like their images CD so bought this one because it was one of the highly rated CD by them.  Kind of sounds dark but interesting listen to as it is like a rock story.
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|I liked it at the theater and I was surprised how good it was watching it at home.  Excellent movie!
B000I9VZKW|5.0|The movie is, in a sense, your typical Hollywood fare, but it does have its deeper and hilarious moments. Overall very fun to watch.

B001EQ5ZJK|5.0|Easy to read, technical stuff made easy to understand and the best part is epigenics is starting to gain world wide recognition and making the scientific world stop and re-think old theories.
B00A6VAW9W|5.0|How totally ecclectic tis album is.You actually forget who you are listening to because there are so many familiar artists and the music does't follow on specific theme.Well done Kenny...................
B00AB7HESI|5.0|its a very entertaining app. I have it on my Nintendo DS.<br />it takes a long time to download though.
B00A4OALL0|2.0|I grew up listening to &#34;avant garde&#34; jazz in the 60's and enjoy really high level &#34;free&#34; playing.  I love Wayne Shorter's playing and compositions.  He does have a lot of brilliant moments on this album that you would expect from him.  But this CD has an abundance of &#34;I'm frightened out of my mind and having a meltdown&#34; playing that I thought was just too much of one kind of emotion over and over for my taste.  I really respect the musicianship of all the players on this, but for a band that has been together so long, there isn't the kind of synergy I expect from the best free playing.  This is mostly taken from live performances and the mix is bad in that the piano is way too loud.  His heavy left hand makes you wonder if the bass is just an afterthought.  Blade plays out of character.  Instead of the brilliant moment-to-moment playing you expect from him, he does a lot of abrupt bashing that doesn't seem to gel.  Maybe that's his way of complimenting the &#34;frightened/meltdown&#34; playing that's going on around him.  Listened to it a second time to make sure I wasn't missing something good and then gave the CD away.  Not enough balance of emotions and synergy for me, but this type of listening experience is highly subjective, - it might really speak to someone else who might love everything on it.
B00BMKDTNC|5.0|Fitting ending to an amazing series. Of course, &#34;there are no endings, but it was AN ending.&#34;<br /><br />Many heartfelt thanks to Brandon Sanderson for his remarkable work finishing what Jordan began.
B00C1BU7V8|4.0|This is the best movie about Lincoln that i have seen so far!He did a lot to help this country and in my opinion is the greatest president of all time!The cast and sets in this movie were perfection:-)
B002HFP0QU|5.0|I love the Bee Gees.  They are my favorite singing group. This music motivates me and makes me want to dance.
B008QTVNUI|5.0|In the age of tv reality (not my preference), it's refreshing to see a television drama that can surprise me.  After watching the pilot, I was hooked.  Paid for the full season and was not disappointed.
B0095P29EG|4.0|An entertaining pre-qual to the Avengers.  A definite for the Avenger fan.  Much better than I thought it would be.
B00AEJM6H2|2.0|I did not like this game.  It was difficult to understand and to play.  I deleted it ASAP.  Not<br />a jewel for me.
B0019FOC5E|5.0|This is the best movie soundtrack I have ever purchased.  All of the songs are outstanding.  You cannot sit still listening to this music.
B00BWJARHO|5.0|We really enjoyed the first three Fellowship of The Ring films and frankly, I was concerned that this film would not be able to live up to its predecessor.  Wrong!  This film is more of a walk on the light side (both in content and in actual film lighting).  We enjoyed it more than the first three movies, and that says a lot.  Loved seeing all of the old characters and the younger Bilbo Baggins character.  Enchanting!
B008QTVNUI|5.0|Good story.  A little &#34;Hollywood&#34; occasionally but great characters and background. I recommend it to anyone who like techno-intelligence stories.
B00C5W3SBE|5.0|This is the best movie I have ever seen in 3d in theaters. The special effects and sound was brilliant. Definitely ore-ordering the 3d version. I can't wait to watch and compare the effects in 3d on my tv to that of the theater. This will be my first 3d movie for my new 3d TV.
B0068THAGY|5.0|Like the finishing short film that is made by the children characters. The whole movie is quite entertaining. And all those small actors did a great job.
B00AN0KBJC|5.0|Superb acting. Great story. Epic scale. There isn't much else to say.  Some people may be turned off by the sex and violence which is present in abundance.

B009NX2XA0|4.0|I Love  the Old Movies. They have good  storylines along with  The black & white movies too  Plus all the great actors & actress  really know how to perform.
B002N2SYAG|5.0|I recently became quite fond of this show, and S5 has some of the most interesting or relevant eps in the story arc.  The IQ of the vids here is quite satisfactory, just as the sound and all the options (like CC).
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This book is a timeless classic. Bought it in kindle form now ordering it in paperback so it can stay on my bookshelf forever and ever. It's wisdom is infinite and really puts life in perspective with a smile on your face and tears in your eyes. LOVE :)

B004J4WKTW|4.0|I really enjoyed this book because it is not like any other book I have read. It really makes you use your imagination and brings back the joy of being a kid. You get flash backs of going to the circus and your imagination of when phones and tvs were just objects that didn't have as much significance. I recommend this book to a dreamer and believer.
B009JZWO3I|5.0|I love this show. I like getting it in 1 disc but the week by week is more affordable. The story line is realistic and all to \\"today\\" living

B00AIQP9DE|5.0|This is a great, varied game. The hog parts are good with minimal repeat images.  The puzzles are interesting but vary greatly in interest and difficulty, mostly easy. Interesting story line, well worth the 3 bucks.
B0065GC0BA|4.0|book about reality, good writing, emotional with out being over done. A jojo moyes book to recommend. not long drawn out
B003U69IX6|5.0|We got this for the Kindle Fire with the Audio. My 12-year-old son who &#34;hates&#34; reading and struggles to read at his grade level loved this book and finished in record time. His language arts teacher is very impressed.<br />I highly recommend this process for anyone who is had a student who has a hard time focusing on a reading assignment.
B00A8ECU24|3.0|I love the app but ever since the new update (the royal wedding one ) my game keeps crashing whenever I try to load it up. I'm very disappointed Gameloft. I really want to play it :(. Please fix
B00881PTRC|1.0|was good till 2000 pts and crashed.  seemed fun till that happened.  bad testers bad.  well can't win them all
B008XG1X18|5.0|it is an awesome thing to do when u r bored. I love it soliloquy much I cant stop playing it lol.
B00B4VXQC8|5.0|This cd is a bit different from the other Jovi music I own, which is alot.  I was extremely and pleasantly surprised at how much I liked this new work. You go, Jon!!!
B00C7TAF3Y|4.0|I don't know how much to say about this. It was a lot of fun, and I'd like to see more like it, but maybe a little longer.  Or even maybe as a series of games like chapters in a larger story. Anyway, just the right amount of difficulty for a tablet game.
B008393Q2O|5.0|A great way to keep up with what I need to buy when I go grocery shopping.I really love it
B004S9AK3G|4.0|Very good story with lots of twists. Although it is fiction, it is very believable. I would reccomend any Ken Follet books.
B006BGZJJ4|5.0|it works perfectly! I ordered one because I had lost my original charger and found it after I received my order and amazon was gracious to give me a refund and to keep the charger that I had ordered. No hassle great customer service!<br /><br />thanks amazon!
B005LAIIPS|5.0|There's nothing wrong with the DVD. Everything is working well. It has what it says in the description. It shipped exactly on the fifth business day from the day I placed the order. As for the movie, I love it. I can't remove it from my laptop because I keep watching it every now and again. Overall, it's great.
B006TF6WAM|3.0|Although it is a good book it is not really believable. I like to get envolved books but it is a nice read.
B0043VDIAG|4.0|I rated with 4 stars as the story line was interestingly unfolded, stopping me from leaving the book until finished.<br />The topics written about were both relevant to these times and sympathetically thought through and examined.  I liked the way the story grew, entwining the characters lives, giving them strength to face the issues head on when they caught up with them and go on to survive.
B001NHNG64|4.0|I'm having a hoot reading about one of the best anti-heros.  Best thing about the Jack Reacher books, over twenty left to read!
B007SGM084|5.0|I don't normally read romance much less erotica, but this trilogy had me from book one. I want to meet this Mr.Gray...
B009KS4XRO|5.0|Very addicting! This game gives rewards for continuous play! I can sit and play for hours without stopping!Love it! You will find yourself picking a city to stay in.
B005S9EKCW|2.0|The DVD by itself is technically great.<br />Sadly, the film is very desapointing because of poor vocal performances, mainly by Jackman and Crowe, and the imcomprehensible choices the director did : filming so much in close-up, erasing most of the epic from the show's possibilities and not allowing room enough to the actors. Same about the orchestrations : where are the fun and the epic brought to the ears one can experienced thanks to the concert versions of 10th and 25th anniversaryn of the show ?<br />Anne Hathaway, Eddie Redmayne and Samantha Barks did great job though.<br />I waited 20 years for this movie, was not able to see it in theater for personnal reasons and to discover they failed at adaptating it correctly breaks my heart.<br />Now we will have to wait for a better adaptation in many years (let's hope so) and studios will for sure think twice before they greenlighted any adaptation of MISS SAIGON I'm still waiting and hoping for...
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|Love this game wish every minecraft game was this fun along withmost games in the appstore:-P. Wish could make my own game and songs and stuff but I can't any get this game no joke
B00BP4WAZS|4.0|It was no Monsters, Inc., but it had some really funny moments and a good plot. My family enjoyed watching it together, and the kids watched it multiple times before our rental period expired.
B00BHMETKC|5.0|Thilling from the beginning and nail biting at the end. Well done and its a true story. Watch the end credits  for bonus clips
B00C1BUYX4|4.0|The acting was great in this movie, I felt I was there. I recommend this movie to anybody to watch.
B000I8FRIO|4.0|I purchased this book as a supplement to ease some of the wear and tear on the original version I had had as a child and which my daughter now loves.  The two major differences I noticed between the two are: 1) the revised edition is thinner, some of the pages from the original version are condensed, and some were dropped entirely.  2a) the revised edition has many many more female characters - some of the originally male characters were either redrawn or labeled with female names or female characters were added to a page to reflect evolving gender roles. 2b) technical elements were updated (a wood burning stove was replaced with an electric range, an egg beater was replaced with an electric mixer, and so forth).<br /><br />These changes are obvious if you are as familiar with the original edition as I am; if you are not, if you pay attention to the depth of color in the characters, the new additions and other changes are in a slightly lighter tint.
B005LAIIJY|5.0|If you review a Quentin Tarantino film, you must grant him leeway on some things, otherwise, a false rating would have to be given. \\"Django Unchanined\\" is a brilliant and excellent film with one minor glitch: all those explosive eruptions in human bodies from single bullets. So grant is given.<br /><br />Some reviewers refer to this film as a Western revenge film. I call it Magic Realism, a genre which would explain the immediate evolution of Django's gunslinging skills, his vocabulary explosion, and a new-found confidence in speaking educated English (or American). The most blantant exhibit of Django's evolution from lowly slave to freeman to confident bounty-hunter to bold Black Man, finally to Super Hero is through costuming and precisely through what Django selects as each juncture of his rise. The froppery of the blue costume indicates the inexperience in selecting what should represent the subtle quality of a free man. Finally, the leather vest and the weathered look of a cowboy depict a man who has arrived: not a black man, but a full man, a man who is not only free himself, but free to free others, to be a Super Hero.<br /><br />Magic Realism is a South American creation in taking sordid facts of history and incorporating totally unrealistic things to make the history more tolerable. In the South the first slaves who disappeared in stories through the magic of simply flying away while actually traveling through the Underground Railroad were probably the first indications of this magic in this realistic setting. Tarantino rescues a lowly slave into freedom via the moneyed hands of a German immigrant, untainted by the strictures of slavery as Southerners knew and experienced it. Thus, even slaves themselves adhered to that set of rules, most notably through the character of Stephen, played by Samuel L. Jackson. There could not be a more obsequious slave than Stephen. However, in private Stephen actually becomes his white master's confident confidant. It's a shuck, thus a bit of magic realism.<br /><br />When Django (Jamie Foxx) becomes this amazing gunslinger in the most rapid sleight of hand, Tarantino is playing with magic realism. Does the viewer allow this \\"willing suspension of disbelief?\\" Since it's Tarantino, it should be a given (except for the exploding flesh). It was also fascinating to watch Foxx transform from an uneducated slave into the Super Hero he finally becomes--watch for the suggestion of Roy Rogers at the end (or so I thought).<br /><br />Homage to other films is another of Tarantino's trademarks. The most obvious was the slowing running word MISSISSIPPI across the screen when the doctor and Django arrived in the hotbed of racism, Mississippi. The huge letters paid homage to \\"Mississippi Burning,\\" a film with Gene Hackman and Willem Dafoe, a film saturated with murder and mayhem to this film in which murder and mayhem are soon to happen but in reverse.<br /><br />In the Mississippi setting in a plantation named Candyland, after the Candie family, comes the despicable Col. Candie, played with aplomb and relish by Leonardo DeCaprio. Oh my gosh, but he was good--uh, bad, and so convincing.<br /><br />I would be remiss if I did not mention Christoph Waltz, so deserving of his Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor. Tarantino's weaving of this German character into a Southern setting, especially naming his black female slave after a German mythological character, was simply brilliant. How he puts these two characters together is the focal point for Django's later heroic rescue. Of course, Tarantino manipulated the plot, but so cleverly!<br /><br />\\"Django Unchained\\" is the story of a classic hero quest: Django is the hero, the doctor is the Wise Old Man, both having various obstacles to overcome, a villain in Col. Candie, and the damsel who must be rescued. I always thought the Star Wars story was a perfect quest theme, but \\"Django Unchained\\" has become a modern, although historic, mode for the quest theme. This film is brilliant!me. This film is brilliant!
B000ME5B30|2.0|I watched the video for Global Issues class. Some of the information was good, other parts were just bashing previous administrations.
B00BD2DRHW|1.0|Liked first version, Graphics looked better on this one.<br /><br />Got stuck in first level, Could not easily figure out why.  Quit playing.
1609611543|4.0|Purchased this book after hearing from several friends how they quickly lost weight by eliminating wheat products. In the first week, I lost 8 lbs, which was nice. But what has been truly amazing, is that I have much more energy than I have had in the last few years AND my post-nasal drip symptoms have virtually disappeared. I have been coughing for the last 35+ years and since starting this wheat belly lifestyle, I no longer have post-nasal drip, which is amazing!<br /><br />Not sure how much longer it'll take for me to lose more weight, as I haven't lost any more weight since my initial week, although I am still following the diet rules. Also look at wheat products much more differently now having read the book. There's something to be said about changing one's lifestyle to follow this wheat-free diet. Kudos to the author!
B002722R64|3.0|Entertaining but not a wow! Same old bond story i.e. conspiracy, catch the bad guy, kill the bad guy and kiss the girl... after awhile it is the same story line different plot and different stunt and CGI effects. Still entertaining!
030758836X|4.0|What an amazing book - I read it in 48 hours! Suspenseful, thrilling, chilling and mysterious - this novel is superbly written! Gillian Flynn is terrific at keeping the reader in suspense until the very end of the book. A must read for all those who love a good mystery.
B00CDT41RY|5.0|Super scenery and rich in depicting the struggles in the black slave history. Beautiful and unique story line. Kept me focus on the development of Django character and story all throughout the film. Exceptional film.
0307341577|2.0|After reading Gillian Flynn's Gone Girl, I really thought this book would be more exciting, but instead it scared the heck out of me! Way too much gore and blood for my taste, although quite mysterious throughout the entire book, which kept me on the edge of my seat. I read it in 3 days, but afterwards was a bit scared to stay in my house alone! A definite read if you not only like mystery, but also some blood. Would make a great horror flick!
B006C45LHA|5.0|I was very skeptical that mixing a western with science fiction was even feasible but this movie works.  it's realistic and believable with great acting.  I liked it so much after renting it, I purchased it.  Great action, special effects, and has a few nice twists and turns.
B004VMVTNU|1.0|Watch out for these guys. You buy the paid version with certain features and they remove them later and charge you to get them back (stopwatch).
0062059963|4.0|America is still torn between her love for Aspen and her growing feelings for Maxon. The group of girls is getting smaller and America might not be the focus of Maxon's attention anymore. As time runs out America is left searching her feelings and deciding what she wants out of life.<br /><br />America has grown a lot since she was selected. I really like her views on how things should be and the way she fights for what is right even though her views are not well liked. She has legitimate concerns about what kind of queen she would be and is really confused about what she should do. The king is a real piece of work. I hope that she can rise above him in book 3. Although I like both of the men in this series I was starting to get sick of the back and forth between Aspen and Maxon. America was playing with feelings and it was getting old. I was really happy with America's decision at the end and I completely understood Maxon's decision but it made me want to kick him just the same. Some crazy stuff happens with the girls in THE ELITE and some people really surprised me. I love Marlee and hope we will get more of her in the last book.<br /><br />Like book one, THE ELITE was an easy read. I love Kiera's writing style and the ever suspenseful plot. The character growth was great and the stakes are high. AH how will it all end. The last book entitled THE ONE (I think, Goodreads says it is at least) won't be out until spring 2014 *pout*
B003TTCURU|5.0|I enjoyed the characters involvement with each other.  These people are really great actors.  They are able to make each scene seem like you're there somehow with them as they work.  It's like the back stage pass while watching people do their  jobs, how some people make mistakes and others make great discoveries and succeed.
B0055S348W|1.0|Even though the Amazon buy box had a checkmark confirming compatibility with Kindle Fire HD, cannot print Gmail, Google Docs, Messages.  After checking with support, this is known issue, they are \\"working on it\\".  Shame on Amazon for ripping off customers with a paid app that doesn't work.
B006YTTVHO|5.0|Relevant, to the point and actionable. The steps and pointers really are simple and allow you brief insights into human behavior.
B006ZDS7CE|5.0|Always a pleasure to listen to the ever changing Lana Del Rey songs. Her voice and lyrics are always intriguing and keep me intent on listening over and over again.
B000OVLINI|4.0|I truly enjoyed this book but would not have chosen it on my own.  The Pinckney Community Public Library had this as our April Book Club read.  I liked the development of the characters and of the story.  I did not like that I had to &#34;work&#34; to figure things out and to make sense of the unwinding of the story.  I understand that there are other books from Zafon - I will give another a try.
B00A0HQ7H8|5.0|Love the boldness of her lyrics and the fluctuation in the key she sings in. The more I listen to the songs, the more I pick up on creative lyrics and chuckle to myself. :-)
B003MC5N28|3.0|I was fourteen when this book came out, and I think I missed out on not being able to read it when I was a kid.  So much of the story's impact is lost when viewed through adult eyes.  While I can see what all the fuss is about, and why it (deservedly) won so many awards, the story seems rather ho-hum to my grown-up self.
B00ABA1OP4|1.0|Great song listing - awful video quality. The videos are clearly compressed, not the quality I was expecting from a bluray, not HD to me. You can get same quality from youtube. Returned and get a hit of 50% for restocking fee, isn't this nice?
B002O2THVA|5.0|We, as a family, like John Wayne films,  Good, Clean Material and John Wayne portrayed down to earth people who made mistakes and had many values we appreciate.  Although not perfect, we mainly watch his movies anytime, with so much trash available, these are good clean classic movies.
B004PR71JC|5.0|Great song, delivered on time, my kids at the daycare can't get in off of it... My baby girl ask for it on the car, on the house, and everywhere... she dance all day with this cd and shake her body like crazy, she get super tired and I am super happy.
B00BBRPRDG|4.0|Just bought this new Poco album, and I'm liking it a lot. I've been a fan since the 1970's, and bought most everything they've recorded since then. I read another review lamenting that Paul Cotton isn't represented? Sorry to hear that, and I wish this mp3 download came with liner notes. I was a huge fan of their last new album, \\"Running Horse,\\"  10 years back, and would recommend that one as well. I have seen the band live twice, the first time in a nice big venue, hot off their \\"Legend\\" album, and then a few years later in a hole in the wall joint, and they put on great shows both times.
B004HO6I4W|5.0|My family and I are big fans of Rio... My son and dougther love it... It doesn't have a define gender so they enjoy together, the animation is spectacular, the song are great, the story is beautiful and the lesson is positive. We love it, I will recomend it. The movie came on time, and I didn't find it cheaper anywhere.
B00BPLDCVM|4.0|This is a great album, but since it only has eight tracks, it gets old after listening to it a few times.
B0060MYM7O|5.0|I do not think there is much else to be said about the Game of Thrones series except that it is amazing. The series, like the books, keeps you enthralled the entire time. The flow is particularly well done and does not slow down one bit.
B0024CEY36|5.0|An exciting story and very inciteful about the events of the time.  Excellent historical fiction that brings the events of the time to life.
B00BHMETKC|5.0|We were so happy to see this excellent film available for instant download.  Well worth it's best picture award.  We just love Amazon Prime
B008Y7N7JW|4.0|I enjoyed the movie as it was better than  i expected. I was worried that the deaths of the children in the movie would be a real downer.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I love it! well except somethings but the rest of the show is awesome. LOVE RICK!!! though he got a little bit cook cook (crazy for the moment) still totally understand him losing his wife, taking care of his children, and an entire group. Sure, it is all lot of pressure. *_*, Darly wow his did some kick butt (can't say the &#34;a&#34; world ). Carl really surprise at his attitude; nay not really all adolecence get to the dark age. well forward to see season four which I was not expecting for but cool huh. hope none of my favorite characters die T.T.
B004LWZW6U|4.0|This was a funny campy movie with some gore. I liked the light-hearted movie that did not take itself seriously.
B0045XKJBI|3.0|Like the book better but it would be a boring movie if be all same (detail by detail) as the book, so yeah, it was good
0061714402|3.0|I've always been a Megadeth/Dave Mustaine fan. There will never be a guitarist as legendary as Dave Mustaine. Anyway, this book is very well written. It's very detailed and it really gives you a lot of information never published or released before. If you're the type of person who is curious about Dave's early private life, then this is the book for you.    This book isn't without it's bad points though. As I read this I got the impression that Dave is high on himself. There are some points where he brags on himself that I found quite annoying. I don't understand why celebrities have to be so full of conceit. He also appears to be smug and a know-it-all as well, which I can't stand.  Another bad point is when he describes joining Metallica. I get the feeling that his resentment and anger toward Metallica is still there even though it appears, (hence The Big Four concerts) that he and the members of Metallica have buried the hatchet. You can feel the anger he's held for such a long time.    All-in-all I would consider this book a good read. You be the judge.
B001V7SME2|5.0|Don't let the subtitles put you off.  This is one of the best horror movies in the last 30 years.
B004JN1CW4|3.0|Finished it because I had to... you know? When you get so far in a series you just have to polish it off. It had all the violence and excitement of the series, but didn't add much in terms of depth or originality. If you liked the first few, you'll probably like this one, too.
B00C1XZ2LQ|5.0|Outstanding soundtrack!  This hybrid genre reminds me of a lovechild of Daft Punk's Tron OST and Hans Zimmer's classic sound (Batman/Inception moods).  I thought it worked perfectly with the movie.  About 30 minutes into the movie, I knew I had to add this soundtrack to my collection.  Great for productivity at the desk or around the house, and altogether perfect for sunrise drives to work. (only complaint is I can't take off for work the way he does off that platform!)
B004H4XDBI|5.0|This was one of the most satisfying sequels I've ever encountered. Forman keeps the story creative by bringing it to the reader from a different narrative perspective from the first. Its twisty plot is none-the-less believable with none of the contrived fairy tale story telling that has so often disappointed.<br /><br />Outstanding and entertaining.
B009NG1Q96|4.0|It was like the most fun right roller coaster I have been on that frustrated me so much, I only loved the book even more.  I never realized how many different emotions a book could bring out of me till this book.  It was refreshing rather than your normal happy fairytale-like love triangle where everyone is happy in the end.  Please, author, write the next as fast and as page turning as you can!  I need another friend like the elite.
B003F3FJQO|3.0|The Maze Runner was pretty good. This one is a step down. If you loved Maze runner, pick this up. If you thought Maze Runner was only okay, its not worth it to forge on... if you read this one, you'll have to read the next one, and both of them are below the interest and originality of the first.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Sylvia Day is an awesome writer, her words flow on paper and make the heat flow in a person.  How can anyone put this down, let alone not re read it a few times just for the experience.
B001GA1RFA|3.0|I am yet to find a John Green book that is the equal of the first of his I read, &#34;The Fault in our Stars.&#34;<br /><br />This one was one of the better ones, though, and I enjoyed the story even  though it was fairly obvious and lacked depth.
B00821OX98|5.0|Love this show. Great show if you are a sci-fi, alien junkie. Noah makes this show great...he was great in ER and still great in this. Give it a try!
B007XNAOS0|5.0|Baroness are pretty cool, just discovered them.  All songs are great.  LOVE THEM.  If you're a fan I think you too will love it!
B00AYB1RXE|5.0|Alternate realities do exist. In this one, a gifted singer-songwriter from the 1970s who never made it is is revealed as something else entirely on the other side of the world. Every bit of it is amazing, including how good his songs really were. Although I have to admit I spent a good part of it waiting to see if it was just an elaborate put-on or a Christopher Guest parody. Instead it's the ultimate Whatever Happened To story. It won't change the world, but it's a very entertaining ride.
B008FTAAG2|5.0|Maria can sing!  Seriously she can wail!! and sing sweetly 2 seconds later.  I love all the songs on this CD.  You should totally buy it if you love some hard rock!  OR if you like hot ladies who can sing!
B004XUMMFE|5.0|Fun, old and new school sci-go western. Sorry I missed it when it was new. Maybe it wouldn't have been cancelled.
B003L0QQEA|5.0|Me encanto la forma en que se escribe este libro, es bueno para saber realmente como imagino el autor a Frankestein y no como lo vemos en las peliculas actuales.
B004EBT5CU|5.0|A little short but excellent.  She is a rare talent, I bought the CD because i love her voice and her music and I wasn't disappointed.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|This was a wonderful read.  I could not put it down.  I wanted more and then I found The Shift Omnibus...
B0091LS07E|5.0|This is pretty much what I expected.  Alicia Keys has a wonderful voice and the cut 'Girl on Fire&#34; is why I first bought it.  The rest of the CD is also very good, some songs I like better than others, but all are good and worth listening to.
B0057R5XRG|5.0|i love Jurassic park and to finally have them on blu-ray i feel complete lol i love it, I highly recommend it to the fans of Jurassic park like me :D
B00BEZTMQ8|5.0|not much to say about this, if your a fan of the lord of the rings trilogy then this is a must have.
B00296A4F4|5.0|Thought this show was about high school kids so didn't watch it... But the grandkids got me into it because of all the show tunes they sang and they thought Lea Michele was such a great singer..so started watching it every week.
B001PPGAK8|5.0|i got this movie from the black friday sale so for $5 with shipping i was in. the movie was pretty good just as long as your not a fan. if you are then dont watch it... this doesnt relate to anything in the comic series
B009GEFXLC|5.0|Love this show due to Castle and Beckett love affair, also love how Castle has a connection with his daughter.  Great that Ryan and Jennie are going to have a baby, wonder how that going to play out.
B00A7OIXW6|5.0|not much to say about this, pretty good movie and since I pre-ordered this I got it a day early.
B009AP2G26|5.0|I really enjoy this show  love the dancing movements and singing of course, they have some great talent in this show.
B004GYY714|5.0|This has done exactly what I need.  I've been able to use it easily on the wifi at work and at home.
B00CDT41RY|2.0|I liked the storyline and the acting, but hated the music and the way the movie was typical Terrantino.  If you are a Terrantino fan, you will enjoy this.
B00ABGEFWC|3.0|Worked the first time but it stopped working after a hopeful 6 tries!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!No one should have this app,I am about to delete it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! But&middot;&middot;&middot;&middot;&middot;&middot;&middot;&middot;&middot;&middot;&middot;&middot;&middot;&middot;&middot;&middot;&middot;&middot;&middot;&middot;&middot;&middot;&middot;  It's free AND FUN ,but still be wise and don't purchase it!!!!!!
B009HV2JT8|5.0|Unique story line full of action and adventure. Lincoln Vampire Hunter brought it. Only sad part is that it was probably overlooked by many because there were three Lincoln movies out at the same time. This is a must watch for vampire fans.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|The game is the best if you like animals. You really feel like your taking care of the horses. This game is plain AWESOME. It is a good game that can help people learn how hard it is to take care of your animals.
B005MLOOJA|5.0|I am hooked on this show! I started watching the current season last Fall and was excited to see past seasons were available on Prime membership.
B004LROUNG|3.0|I chose the 3 star rating because although this story had a wonderful ending, I could not get into the book at first.  It sort of dragged.  Once the story picked up steam, I could not put it down.  David is such a great character.  You cheer for him throughout and you see in him what society needs to see in lawyers - decency, compassion, honesty all encompassed in a tough exterior.  David is gutsy.  What was so beautiful about him was seeing his fear drive him in the right direction and he just went with it.  I was proud of him seeing glimpses of myself in his spirit.  I am not much of a reader for suspense, but this was suspense of a different kind.  I really appreciated getting to know Wally, Oscar, Rochelle and especially David.
B000FA5SMK|5.0|DeMille is a good writer.This book is the first of his character John Corey a very bright  and wisecracking detective.He is quick on the uptake and knows his stuff. I love the very clever and sardonic comments Corey makes. You really will \\"Laugh out Loud\\". The situation is believable and logical with nothing \\"far out\\". I  am going to read all of the writer and I can vouch for \\"The Lions Game\\" and \\"Wildfire\\". Get started!!, you will love DeMille
B0055SWM08|5.0|Addictive gameplay. If you're looking to waste some time this is absolutely the game for you.  Who needs luminosity? This brain trainer is free.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Wonderful sequel! I can't wait to read the next one!<br />Katniss is my personal hero.  I think she will choose peers
B002OR0RP0|5.0|I believed that this was a great addition to the ice age series. It was great for the whole family.
B005LLSNNE|5.0|killer series.. cant wait for a new season to get rolling.. Even dead tired, i manage to stay up to watch..
B0042KZJR8|5.0|Love this album I particularly like the song \\"Hollywood,\\" which is why I got this particular compilation.  Can't wait to get Michael's new cd! :)
B0063M22QO|5.0|I really really enjoy playing mahjong. It is challenging and I play it a lot. I would recommend it to others who enjoy this type of games.
B00BD2DRHW|4.0|Fun game and it makes you think. I've only played a few times because I haven't had it long. Try it.
B009AMANBA|5.0|I enjoyed this movie as a whole. If you are interested in what Lincoln did for slavery and how he impacted the world so much, you should watch this movie. It is not a documentary about him, but mainly about how he went about freeing the slaves. It also gives him an honorable exit which you will see. It's a fantastic movie and I don't want to spoil anything. You should watch it. It's not a boring documentary about just his term as president though, you will enjoy it. It was directed by Spielberg, honestly how bad can it be? He is brilliant and the acting stars many famous actors who do a fantastic job.<br /><br />Update: I forgot to add this yesterday when I wrote this review. Lincoln is someone I will always admire and this movie made that even more so. You truly get to see his character and what he did for the United States. I actually visited Washington D.C. and got to see where Lincoln died in the same bed they picture in the movie. I am sure it is a remake of it, but it looks exactly the same. The room couldn't have fit that many people in it though I don't think. I think they should have left some of those people out to make it more real. Of course I don't know for sure though but I remember the room being very small. I also got to see the theater where he was shot. It was all blocked off though. It looked great in the movie. All in all, this was a fantastic movie if you are into history at all. Great acting.
0061906220|5.0|My 29 month old can't get enough of this book!  She requests it everyday.  My husband and I read it to her, and we sing the song in different versions, and she loves it.  I just purchased a few more books from the same series.
B0012HRJEA|3.0|The movie was honestly pretty boring. I'm not a huge fan of Shakespeare, but maybe if you are, you might enjoy it more. I liked how the movie started out, as it seemed comedic and didn't take itself seriously. If the whole film was like that, maybe I might've enjoyed it.
B002M80918|5.0|Extremely well written and acted. One of those films that grabs you and keeps you there throughout.  An amazing film.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|This was a great conclusion to this heart pumping tale of Love, passion & trust. I find myself wanting more of Christian & Anastasia,,, & Teddy!!! Lol, don't want to give to much away..... I hope the story goes on, & the movie is made.
B004V6BQ3O|4.0|I'm used to much more expensive mics, so it was surprising to like what I heard. It's a decent mic for the price.
B00BSBU4EC|5.0|This was a very intriguing movie and I loved the characters! A recommended keeper! Good for the whole family too!
B008MG1E4A|5.0|Awesome! One of the best firsthand books I have ever read. The writer really brought to life what happened with this historic event.
B009S33I68|5.0|Best Vietnam story I've read yet, goes so much further than what I already knew. Now I know the rest of the story.
B008YKGQR4|1.0|I thought it would be great but it is way to small to see and when you zoom, you just have to scroll around to see everything. It kept freezing up and slowed my kindle fire down so I uninstalled it after 1 use
0743454537|3.0|The only reason I read this book is because of my book club. This is not my usual subject to read about; not crazy about kids and cancer. However, I'm committed to read at least 100 pages (a book club rule). Once I started reading it, I couldn't put it down. I couldn't believe how good it was, until the end. I have never read any of Jodi Picoult's other books and I probably won't in the future. This book left an incredibly bad taste in my mouth.<br /><br />Ms. Picoult tackled some very difficult issues that I pray that I will never have to face. I couldn't imagine being in the mother's shoes. There were times I hated her and other times that I felt great empathy for her. I had a rollercoaster of feelings throughout the book. Up and down, back and forth.<br /><br />I appreciated that Ms. Picoult gave the reader several different perspectives and the book wasn't narrated by one single character. Each had their own story to tell. I thought all of the subplots flowed and fit together well.<br /><br />My major complaint with this book is the ending. It was absolutely abhorrent. It didn't expect for the story end that way. It literally made me sick to my stomach. I think it could of ended in a much better way. I'm really angry that I just didn't quit at 100 pages and saved myself the pain of the ending.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|The art of racing in the rain is an amazing book! By far this is my favorite book of any I have ever read!
B009LMTDL0|4.0|Good book that challenges our societal norms - as a male leader, it helped me with my own awareness of how to more effectively engage and challenge the women in my organization.  Very well written!
B000ICRKLM|5.0|I have watch Stargate Atlantis Season 1-4 and they are all great! Prime makes it easy and cheap to watch them all.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|Great story of life told by a dog. Not as sad as I expected. Must read for all who have shared life with a &#34;best friend&#34;.
B00ADS98FC|5.0|My son and I have watched this movie numerous times, and enjoy it each time we see it. I just thought I'd watch for fun, but have feel in love with each and every character....and Fat Amy is the best. A good time movie to share with family. *there are a couple of gross,over the top scenes, but enjoyable nonetheless.*
B008602KQI|4.0|It is hard for me to &#34;love&#34; ANY movie adaptation of a book because it is so hard to do successfully.  However, I was close in this case.  I think they did a tremendous job portraying the feel of the story, as well as all the important scenes.  They did take a bunch of liberties (adding scenes and dialogue) but in most cases I feel it was actually necessary to help out people who had not read the book.
B000TSUCAQ|5.0|Easy recipes... Should have thought of these myself. My kids loves to use it. The recipes are easy to prepare, without alot of &#34;fancy&#34; ingredients.
B003FOFJAY|5.0|This is a lighthearted chic flick type show.  Great for taking your mind off of stress.<br /><br />It is pure easy entertainment that doesn't require a lot of thinking.<br /><br />I find the characters to be a wonderful combination of personalities and intriguing relationships.
0307472590|5.0|Me da mucho gusto poder dar tan excelente puntuaci&oacute;n a un escritor espa&ntilde;ol, no se me hace facil la lectura de los escritores &iacute;beros, pero con Zafon ha sido una hermosa experiencia, lo recomiendo ampliamente, me resulto ademas de un buen libro, divertido y emocionante.
B008TRUDAS|4.0|I haven't read Colleen Hoover before.  Nice story which held my interest to see the outcome.  I have ordered the second book in this story plot.
B005CGI3ZG|5.0|So glad I purchased this series it takes me back to my teen years when I couldn't wait for the next episode to come on. It's exactly how I remembered it including most of the music. Anyone who loved this show growing up should definitely get this series. This show was iconic and should be remembered that way. The melodrama and dialogue made this one of the best shows of its time.
B000HKYN74|5.0|Love the season long story line of tracking down the Xindi and how the conflict is finally resolved.  This entire series has some great acting and great writing and I would place it #2 in the Star Trek rankings right behind the original series.
B003O86FMW|5.0|One of the best books ever! Leaves u wanting to read the next! As soon as i can i will!
0060578793|5.0|Mr. Wiseman spent years teaching all the information here<br />to the British Special Air Service.<br /><br />He, quite literally, wrote the book and now you can profit from<br />his experience. Well worth the price.
B0071XO8RA|3.0|How about a freight elevator for those of us with bad knees ? Only kidding --I found the first part exciting .  First better than thel last psrt where romance feels contrived
B00CDSVZHY|5.0|Great movie.  Classic Quentin style.  If you like the others, you will enjoy this movie as well.  Fast paced and an easy watch.
B001QWBM62|5.0|Awesome -- has built-in high-quality stereo mics, two XLR inputs... it's got everything you need, and the price just keeps dropping. Highly recommended.
B000LTAY1U|5.0|Seiko 5 series<br />Is a very confortable analog watch<br />The green canvas strap fits with any cloth, social , regular, w/e.
B00BHMF578|5.0|Great Movie - one of the best movies I have watched in a while. I would Highly recommend watching this movie
B00AE2IJIE|4.0|I liked the old feel of the movie but with a new story i haven't yet seen before, or at least told like this one. I laughed and was fairly entertained by this movie. Pleasantly surprised.
B00BHHIWQO|5.0|Finally tried the game after numerous request from friends to play. Now I love it. The game provides a challenge with the time play that engages you to keep trying to do better on your score.
B000JMKRKC|3.0|Not great but not the worse that I have purchased. Would not read again. Would not recommend for anyone to buy.
B0031RS7X6|5.0|I love this book. The plot is a bit of a fairy tale, but nevertheless... I love the story, love caracters, and the reason why I re-read this book when I am feeling blue is that it always lightens my mood and brings back my smile.
B00BEPVAV8|5.0|Its fun and everyone in my family enjoys it. We play and try to beat each others high score. very fun.
B00AB0AXU6|2.0|I thought this was the poorest of the RE series. The setting is a base under ice - not very inspiring. The plot was absolutely abysmal, and did not advance the storyline of the series. The movie was just a set of action scenes, one following the other in rapid succession, with very little story in between. The action scenes were stylized at times and somehow were very dry and boring - car chases, big monster, gunbattle, and then big monster. I think that you get the picture. The acting is reasonable; unfortunately the actors were given very little to work with.<br />  There should be some type of plot, even if the movie concepts are simple. This movie fails even that low bar. I would definitely not watch this again. This is commercialism at its worst - the studio clearly pumped this movie out to take advantage of the prior films. There was no attempt to make this movie anything of substance.<br />  I would rate this a 65/100, or a D as far as US high-school grades go. Any of the other RE movies I would watch, but this is a most intolerable sequel.
B000JMKQX0|1.0|I purchased this book 3 weeks ago. It has taken me that long to finish it. It helped me to get to sleep at night. I do not believe all the other reviews as I am thinking they are either; a) related to the author or, b) paid to review this book. I was not impressed at all and do not plan on seeing the movie either.
B007KDFWRG|5.0|This is a CD that you will leave in your car for life. When you order it, make sure you buy two just in case you wear the first one out.<br />We would recommend this recording or anything by Trucks- Tececci Band, especially this &#34;Band Live&#34; recording.<br />We love Amazon!
B001ANSSDC|5.0|It was a quick and enjoyable read, can't wait to see the movie now :) I would definitely recommend this book.
B006C1DH92|5.0|I got it because my guys were wanting to try fruit ninja after seeing it on an iPad. However when I started looking for Kindle Apps, I thought it would be fun to include Puss N Boots. I was right. With the different levels and the comments that Puss makes, it really makes it more fun. I didn't think it would be all that, but once I tried it, the boys couldn't get it out of my hands. Loads of fun for the whole family! :-)
B000V86OKG|5.0|Not the best season of Dexter, but still a must-have for development of the characters. Michael C. hall is one of the best actors around, and this series showcases his skills and perfectly complements those of his cast.
0307895475|5.0|I've used many Official Game Guides, but the one thing I found lacking in this particular one, was the stragedy always written up in each Boss fight. These are missed, but maybe the handicp
B000Q6GUW0|5.0|This is the only season of Dexter that actually follows Jeff Lindsay's book. It is also the best. It is a must-have for development of the characters. Michael C. hall is one of the best actors around, and this series showcases his skills and perfectly complements those of his cast.
B005K01VZS|5.0|I am not a Jew but I am a student of the Bible and am familiar with the history of &#34;God's chosen people&#34; and this book let me see into the thinking of one Rabbi's mind and heart.  I am truly sorry that he doesn't believe in Jesus but his love and care for the people around him was interesting from the beginning of the book to the end and I found it hard to put the book down even when I had to.<br />So far, every thing I've read my Mitch Albom has been very interesting and he seems to be drawn to people with a zest for living and loving and that makes for a good read.
B002N5N5M0|5.0|Not the best of the currently available series of Dexter,  but still a must-have for development of the characters. Michael C. hall is one of the best actors around, and this series showcases his skills and perfectly complements those of his cast.
B006LSZECO|1.0|The book went on and on with no real ending. It was hard to get into. Finally got interested and then the end.
B0015ABRE2|5.0|Not the best season of Dexter, but still a must-have for development of the characters. Michael C. hall is one of the best actors around, and this series showcases his skills and perfectly complements those of his cast.
B001UTW7QU|5.0|Walter draws you in from the beginning and the relationship between Peter and Olivia is what makes the show enjoyable to watch. It's easy to start rooting for them. The crazy stories on each episode make for very entertaining episode each season.
B004JZBGWI|5.0|I love it...you can lock your notes change the background color and even more there is a canlder and there is other things involed its so amazing for being free and you should GET THIS APP RIGHT NOW GO GO GO BYE
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Simply put..amazing ending to a great series of books can't wait to see how the books are transform into the movies
B00BSBT8M6|5.0|This is a spectacular movie, presented with stunning beauty and unbelievable adventure.  It's also a heart-breaking tale of love and loss, and a movie about relationships with self, family, animals and gods.  Throughout its harrowing story, it also delves into the quiet mysteries of how we relate to others -- human and otherwise -- and to the world around us.  It's a tough movie to watch if you're an animal lover -- I was speechless and in tears for a very long time after it ended.  Don't be fooled by it's quiet low-key introduction -- this is a powerful movie, emotionally wrenching and full of awe and wonder...
0743270754|5.0|Slow going ONLY at first, then it takes off. Fantastic history. Better than the movie because it covers so MUCH MORE. If Lincoln fascinates you, this is THE biography to read. He was brilliant, and you come to admire him even more, as did those around him, especially William Seward. You clearly &#34;know&#34; those around Lincoln in his presidency. A delicious and meticulously researched history. There are 120 pages of reference notes in the back, in VERY FINE  print. Much smoother reading that way, as opposed to constant footnotes clustered at the bottom of the pages of this superb history.
B0012268N8|5.0|Manassas is a double album that captures a crucial moment in recent musical history. It is purposely divided into four sections which were originally the four sides of the vinyl LP's. Each section reflects a trend that was either maturing or just coming into focus in American music. There are songs reminiscent of Crosby, Stills and Nash (but they are all original), country rock songs presaging the Allman Brothers and the Eagles and that movement, ballads, hard blues, even Cuban Bluegrass! All with a certain confident attitude that Stephen Stills had at the peak of his songwriting skills. And it's incredible to think that he was putting out this kind of material at the same time as he was writing and touring with CSNY. Really amazing stuff, one of my favorite albums.
B009AMANBA|5.0|Especially fun to watch if you have read &#34;Team of Rivals&#34; by Goodwin, which would require maybe 5 to 6 movies to cover the amazing amount of material in the book.
B00338QEKQ|5.0|I've read a lot of WWII books, mostly from an American perspective.  Interesting to see it from the British viewpoint and through Churchill's eyes.  Good coverage of the Aegean campaign which I didn't know much about.
B0053FANPY|5.0|I like this movie from when I first watched it lots of action I bought all the movies made along with it
B004T6IBNY|5.0|This game best mirrors an actual pinball table.  I play it constantly.  I would recommend to anyone as their top pinball game.
B007URVZJ6|3.0|This how-to book for preparing and producing a Kindle ebook has a lot of good information. Unfortunately, the author did not run the book through the process of individuals actually using the book in the way intended. Only then would it be discovered that things that are obvious for printed books differ for ebooks. For instance, what is a page? How long is a page? What are the dimensions of a page? When I'm preparing drafts for a printed book, I know the dimensions of the page and how the margins will fit within that page. I therefore know what will appear on a page and how it will look with a given font. Given that Kindle readers can change the font size and what appears on their page, it is still highly useful to know how printed dimensions will work with ebook dimensions in terms of pages. How will a book developed for print on an 11&#34; by 8.5&#34; inch page convert to an ebook? What template should the author use to make this conversion. What size page and length of line will make the conversion most serviceable? Even if the author is contemplating a smaller format and a words-only book with pages that run continuously without much need for consideration of page dimensions, what is an ideal page size, margin size, line size and font size to work from? Knowing this the author can work up or down the scale to see how changes in any of these might affect the look of an ebook version. All of the above considerations also apply to photos, diagrams, etc. that would appear in the text.
B000SEFNMS|4.0|while the allure of the great outdoors seems so romantic from your living room try living it? Jon Krachour shows this by using different characters, as well as his own, to show the cruelty of nature in the wild. A very enjoyable book about a different breed.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Love the game!! Ignore the ads. A great way to relax and still keep the brain working! I recommend it, and the ads can be ignored!
B003JBI2KM|5.0|This is a wonderful book from anyone who is a new homebrewer to someone who is looking to take a step beyond basic brewing kits.  The book focuses on the basics of homebrewing but can also get very technical but not overwhelming either.  It includes some basic recipes too.  I've read about half o the book and found it was great start.  I've done two brews so far from kits but I'm glad I read the first third of the book before even starting, I felt much more prepared than if I had simply gone off the directions from the beer kit.  My only complaint that I have with the digital book, is that the tables that are in the book don't look good and are very hard to follow in the amazon kindle app on the ipad and some of the illustrations seem to be out of place or on different pages than you'd expect.  Maybe it's better on an actual kindle, but it's a very minor issue, the rest of the content is great, it's been very helpful and a definite recommended read for any new homebrewer or someone who may be thinking about homebrewing.
B008393Q2O|5.0|Very practical and useful for notes, and not to worry about carrying over with slips or sheets which doings or what to buy at the supermarket.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Oh yes,  I have caught the Downton bug.  This second season definitely did not disappoint.  The war scenes are well done and not too schmalzy.  Thomas and O'Brien are just as great as always, and there are a few surprises along the way.  This second season will keep you longing for season 3!
B00499QUK2|5.0|I've had a hard time finding shows I like anymore, too many are focused on violence and adult situations and bathroom humor. But Sherlock is different. This is a show for people who want to think while they're being entertained!
B004EPYZQC|4.0|Obviously, the Fast and Furious series isn't meant to be taken seriously.  Fast Five, however, was much more mature than the previous titles.  The story was deeper, but it still had plenty of thrilling and hilarious shenanigans.  I am looking forward to &#34;Fast Six&#34; this summer!
B005PK56TA|5.0|This show is amazing!  I could not believe how scary it was. Wish I would have watched it sooner. I would recommend it to anyone who loves horror.
B004USRL2S|5.0|I love the soundtrack to this movie, and I especially Love that it is pressed on 10&#34; vinyl.  The quality of the vinyl is superb no scuffs or scratches and it is a bit more weighty and solid than old vinyls but still slim. The quality of the recording is brilliant and does not seem to be pressed using a CD master of the tracks. All in all, It is a good buy. Shipped fast, arrived quickly, no complaints. So if you love this movie (...and the soundtrack) and are a vinyl lover i would say it is a MUST BUY!
B008602KQI|4.0|Great story but can we say shaky camera. Almost had the dizzy just trying to see the thing. But still good if you read the books.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|Couldn't put it down. Just when I thought I knew where it was going, it shifted. Would read this author again!
B009CG1YZ8|5.0|I don't need to write a review...you're either part of the Ash club or you're not.  Those who are know every awesome line and scene in this classic cult phenom!  Those who don't...well, they should.

B000JMKTLO|5.0|I couldn't put this book down! I love everything Gillian Flynn writes.  This book was a great thriller with a surprise ending
B0090SI4LU|5.0|while it didnt follow the book as exactly as i usually like, i think it's a great movie. i think they did a good job of breaking down a 619 page book into a 2 hour movie. definitely read the book first though; you'll feel more connected to the characters when you watch it.
B00CDSVZHY|5.0|Really you need to see this movie I expected some dark stuff being a Tarantino movie and it did not disappoint plus it has an excellent story with an amazing cast and great visuals.
B003G4W49C|5.0|After wondering about purchasing this book several times,  I finally did.  I read this book in two sittings and only because my job got in the way.  I even pondered calling off, lol.<br />This book was thought provoking, richly detailed in describing this young boys thoughts and emotions.  This is definitely one of the best novels I have come across in a long time and for any<br />Science fiction fan it is more than worth it.  I am already getting Cards other books I liked this one so much.<br />Liked is also not enough to describe my feelings over reading this...genuinely a must read!!!

B00AIJP9BS|1.0|The Concept Could Have Had Potential.  The Execution Failed So Badly That I Hate To Insult The Weird Miserably.  Control Is Slow, Clunky, Obscured, And Inaccurate.  Individual Pieces Are Captured, Require Long Draw Bow Style Aiming, And Miss The Ball By The Time It Has Passed.  This Turns A Quick And Fun Game Of Foosball Into A Long Drawn Out Prayer Session Of &quot;Please Let This Actually Hit The Ball And Them Not Return A Slow Motion Lucky Score.&quot;<br /><br />Seriously, Control Isn't That Hard To Implement Usably.  Horizontal Swype Should Grab The RoA, Vehicle Swype Should Then Soon The Row.  Grabbing, Aiming, And Setting The Power Of And Individual, And Extremely Limited Range Piece Is Beyond Retarded.
B0000VCZKW|5.0|It is a good video for kids. It is educative, with no violence or implicit sexual aspects like boyfriends, kissing, etc. which are common in some modern day PG rated movies and cartoons. Matilda comes across as smart kid and this is captivating to my kids. There is a contrast of characters between the sadist Ms Trunchbull and kind Ms Jennifer. This offers an opportunity for the kisd to differentiate between good and bad characters and choose who they want to be.
B00BJS7104|3.0|It is okay.  Lots of bloody violence.  Will watch again to see the cast.  I am hoping that after another viewing it will grow on me.
B00BHMETKC|3.0|but not the movie of the year ....do understand the Affleck sentiment going into the awards show but SERIOUSLY ..if you saw LINCOLN you KNOW that was the MOVIE OF THE YEAR !!!
B00AA7O22U|2.0|Other than the Lone Wolf.  This sequel is not worth the time.  I was really disappointed as I enjoyed the first movie.
B00BFUUMO8|1.0|This is not a game I play.  My grandkids might like it but I am going to delete it.  It is just not my kind of game.
B00475AYJQ|5.0|I really love this series.  I am impatiently waiting for the third book.  The character develop and story line is superb.<br />A dear friend encouraged me to read Patrick Rothfuss; I am forever thankful.
B008I3RARW|3.0|This is the first racing game I got for the Kindle Fire. Like a lot of apps, it runs a little stilted sometimes on my 1st gen Kindle Fire, but seems to run with no problems on my son's 2nd gen Fire. There's nothing too exciting about it, in my opinion, but it delivers what it promises. For a little more style and some more fun with upgrades, I recommend looking up Beach Buggy Blitz. That app has the same issues on my Fire, but it runs fine on my son's and he's had more fun on that one collecting coins and buying upgrades for his cars.
B008FTAAG2|5.0|This album is awsome from this band I realy like how hard the song are on this album I LOVE this album!
B0050DZN4K|4.0|Feedly does what it promised and it's easy to use. I prefer the online version to any of the apps by far, but I haven't seen any other rss reader apps that do more of what you need with such a simple, easy-to-use presentation.
B008Y73940|4.0|Certainly exceeded our expectations. McConaughey is at his best in this type of role, so it seems, although he seldom disappoints.  The final resolution is lacking any complexity, but that didn't diminish the overall experience.
B00C4QWDYY|5.0|Not a lot left to say after all other reviews. I simply love zombies and this TV show rates right up there with most hollywood movies I've seen, and I've seen most of em. lol Excellent+ show. Please keep more seasons coming.
B000W7JWUA|5.0|I have spent dozens of hours playing this game with friends and family. It is the most fun we have had with a board game. Highly recommend it. Very interactive and fun for the whole family.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|Can't beat the price.  It's addictive!  Love the music and lots of cool powerups.  Lots of fun characters.  The splay effects are pretty funny too.
1401924751|2.0|The cards and the box were in brand new condition I dont know if the deck of cards were re-wrapped because 4 of my cards were missing from the deck out of a container that seemed to be untouched. But the artwork on the cards were awesome!
B006BDHAX0|5.0|I love this app.  It challenges my mind and it keeps me thinking.  I would absolutely recommend this to anyone who enjoys a good game of Mahjong.
1401937268|5.0|I was very impressed with deck of cards the artwork is great!! I felt an instant connection with the cards as soon as I opened the deck and went through every cards in the deck. They are trimmed in silver which makes them looks even better. I have to say this is the best deck of Tarot cards that Doreen Virtue has.
B009NG1Q96|5.0|*SPOILERS*<br /><br />This book. o m g this freaking book. My whole life is completely destroyed because of this book but it was worth it because it was so amazing. There are so many things that come unexpectedly, such as rebel attacks, America's presentation, etc. It kept me on the edge of my seat and I read it in less than 12 hours because I just couldn't put it down. I will agree that only bad flaws in some of the characters are the main focus (as someone else said), but there are also good qualities being portrayed too, such as Kriss being so ladylike, caring, and humble, not to mention her adoration for Maxon. I feel like Apsen is the only thing that keeps the plot going because he just adds so many complications in America and Maxon's relationship, and it makes things get more heated. Also I was very surprised about the king! I would have never guessed that he would be so harsh and even resort to whipping his son! Oh my gosh I can't even with this book, so many surprises. If I keep going this will be its own book... so that is all I have to say for the time being!
B005CGI3ZG|5.0|This set came in a great box with lots of exta information on each character, a cd, and a bonus disc. This all came at a really great price too. Great item!
B0064MGU98|5.0|I wish I had been watching this on TV from the beginning, but I'm glad that it is offered for free on Prime.  Now I can catch up on all that I've been missing!
B007OLYQ4E|5.0|You know you haven't read Breakfast at Tiffany's for a long time. Holly Golightly is one of the great characters of fiction. This Holly -- and even more importantly, the time-gone-by of which she is a creature -- isn't what you remember from the movie.  Also, Capote's prose is brilliant. It reads aloud quite well.  Treat yourself to a reread of this great long short story.  Then reread Salinger's The Laughing Man from his 9 Stories.
B004UID2LC|5.0|Its YouTube whats not to like?  Plays video's that people upload for free.  If you watch youtube you need this app.
0385349947|3.0|Sheryl's experiences are helpful.  I do think that she speaks to a select audience though.  There are many women who would not be able to make the choices that she did because they do not have the resources to manage some of those risks. Otherwise, well written.  I do agree that women can offer a great deal to a workplace and hopefully we will learn to stop apologizing for being women.
B002M85TH2|5.0|Not only is this a great film but you can see just how awesome Hallie Berry looks, (nude top shot & panties)<br />See this movie!
B0013AZLP0|5.0|Love this album!  Uplifting and good listening regardless of your mood or time of day.  My opinion, you should buy it!
B00C7KYXHW|5.0|The tension builds slowly in this series that is vastly superior to The Following. Very, very scary! The cinematography is lush and gorgeous.
B008Y7N7JW|3.0|It was a decent enough movie. It was just not my type of film. I give it a 3 out of 5.
B003V5CFV8|5.0|This is the Coen Brothers a their best. This movie helped revive interest in American folk music. The soundtrack is great, too!
B000O5AYCA|5.0|I heard both The National and Band of Horses on Austin City Limits one night.  Love all of the albums so far!
B0070Y46UY|5.0|You don't want to be the one who is left out of the conversation about this book.<br /><br />I read it and had no idea what it was about.  I love hearing other's interpretations and answers to &#34;What did it mean?&#34;  I re-read the book and noticed all sorts of new things.  Why does Pi want to practice multiple religions?  Why does the plot shift so dramatically? Were there even animals in the life boat?  Is Pi sane?<br /><br />Certainly entertaining.  Read the book before you watch the movie.  Get your friends to read it too.  Hours of discussion material at your next dinner party.
B00BTYP6QE|5.0|it's so fun! its arsenal of levels makes it highly addictive.i highly recommend this game to fans of the original cut the rope
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I'm too busy to watch t.v. and I started out intending to watch 1 episode. I ended up watching the entire 3rd season in 2 days! Stayed up way too late and neglected my house- love Downton Abby!
B00B4VI8MQ|5.0|A fun game challenging at times one of the better hidden objects and riddles that I have played must play for all
B006MW3UZW|5.0|This season kept the mystery and romance going. Sure hope Amazon makes season three available soon for their Prime members.
B0085P2Z6E|5.0|Full of long lasting fun (full version only). Inexpensive at twice the price! I like find it games but dislike one's that you have to purchase your way through; this one doesn't nickel and dime you at every step.
B009JZTOG8|4.0|This is a great show! It really brings all the fairy tales and legends together in one place. Whoever created the idea and implemented it is a genius in fantasy. The acting suffers at times, but not to the extent that the story line suffers. This series is  a celebration in creativity.
B00CDT41RY|3.0|I liked Django Unchained, but wasn't overly thrilled with the film. Jamie Foxx did a great job stepping into the shoes of an old western actor, and Samuel L. & Leonardo DiCaprio both knocked out their roles as villains. Christopher Waltz also did a great job nailing his character.<br /><br />Over all a very Tarantino feeling flick - great shoot outs (wild blood splatters), cool music (modern hip hop at times, with classic western sounds/music at others - interesting balance), but not a &#34;great movie&#34;, the story itself needed more action - which saved the film, and less filler scenes.
B005S9EKCW|4.0|So I got it for her for her birthday because I knew it would be an easy score. It came in when it was suppose to and plays just like it should.  I'm not going to get into a movie review b/c I didn't bother to watch it, it was for her not me, and she loved it so that's all that matters.
B006M81Y72|5.0|A very chilling novel. I watched the movie after reading the book at a friend's recommendation, and even though it was all there line for line, I got a very different sense from the novel and enjoyed it much, much more!
0062059963|3.0|I loved how quickly I gobbled up this book.  I was reading until early in the morning, and I couldn't put it down until I had read the last page.  When I finished however, I realized something about it was nagging at me.  The issue- along with the fact that Prince Maxon and America seemed to self sabotage themselves constantly- is the reason I gave this book 3 stars.<br /><br />SPOILER: The scene where Maxon told America about his abusive past as she took care of his beaten back was heart wrenching- my heart went out to the guy, especially when he went through the beating to protect America.  However, he tells her that some things need to be changed &#34;slowly and gradually&#34; and that someday he will stand up to his abuser.  I'm sorry, but if you're being abused, you need to get out of that situation NOW.  It doesn't matter if you are a Prince or very wealthy- GET OUT.  And if the Queen is such an &#34;angel,&#34; she should protect him and help him leave.  It does no good to bear it &#34;quietly.&#34;  (That was also a big issue with Harry Potter 6- Harry was not &#34;brave&#34; when he didn't out Umbridge for her abusive ways- he was being stupid.)  The topping on the cake was at the end of the book when Maxon told America that he needed to trust her more, and that his abuser would be tough on her and watching her all the time.  He then left her alone with the SAME ABUSER.  Seriously?  They both should have left the castle at their first chance.<br /><br />There are too many stories that don't show how serious abuse is.  Maxon could have died from all the beatings that he recieved over the years.  What good does it do to change things &#34;gradually&#34; if you die before it happens?  One of my friend's sisters was killed by her husband who was very abusive.  The ironic part?  She worked for a place that housed people who were abused by others.  She didn't try to leave him until it was too late.  Abuse is serious, and I think the book used it as a tool to showwhy Maxon is guarded, rather than the catalyst for change that it should have been.
B009UAO1ZG|5.0|Lynne Olson just gets better and better at recounting the contentious steps that evolved into US entry into WWII. Read with her two previous books on how Churchill became Prime Minister and the key role played by three Americans, especially little known US Ambassador John Winant, in supporting the British when they were virtually alone against Hitler. Their support paved the way for FDR's tentative yet clear support for joining that battle. While many Boomers think of Vietnam as the only war in recent history that generated deep controversy in the US, the opposition to US entry into WWII, personified by Charles Lindbergh, was even more contentious. Yes, the US banded together after Pearl Harbor, but until that point, US entry was very problematic.  And it is not clear how long the British could have hung on without US entry.
B004G7UTXG|2.0|Characters and plot line did not grab -- so I didn't finish it.  Lost world at the top of the falls?  Climbing the hardest route barefoot?  Didn't seem plausible.
B00BHMF578|5.0|Surprise movie! Great film covering a topic that I am sure most Americans are unaware of. I highly recommend it.
B009AMANBA|5.0|Excellent movie - it should of won more awards!  Being a history buff I also took the time afterwards to look up certain things and they were historically accurate.
B005KDDUVS|5.0|The author in a calculated pace leads the reader to be absorbed by the character's human nature.One feels due to the profound presentation of the writer that is part of this lyfestyle in the early 1900's.Great narrative.
B008BU70HW|5.0|Any fan of this PBS Masterpiece Classic would love to have this app!  Learn more about the characters and the parts they play as well as take a tour of the original Abbey.
B005KB0SU6|5.0|Excellent use of narrative,prose of spanish language.A vivid picture of Barcelona with profound knowledge of the politics,intrigues,facsinating lyfestyle of this cosmopolitan city.
B00A4FOWYQ|5.0|Catchy. Yes, they do actually kind of sound like Wilson Phillips (which according to Wikipedia have been active again since 2004, whaaaa?). Really goofy danc-y music. I actually like to cook or wash dishes or clean to this music. It makes me feel like a modern Cinderella ... 'A dream is a wish your heart makes' no more.
B008602KQI|2.0|The best part of this film was the fashions of the future 1%-ers where the women look like fruit salads or florist shop arrangements, and the men look like lollypops. The premisses are laughable, and why oh why don't they restrict the ages of the contestants - throwing 12 year old's together into a fight to the death with 18 year old's is an astoundingly stupid proposition. Maybe the books explain this and the other ridiculous propositions about life in the future, but the movie falls well short.
1451695195|4.0|I found his experience well described.  The technical data gathered while he was in coma substantiates his experience in my view.  I have shared this book with friends and will continue to do so.
B00AN0KBJC|5.0|The writers of this show are brilliant. They keep the storyline moving along even though it is complex. From week to week you're wondering how the next twist will play out.
B007BGQFTQ|5.0|A good book about vampires, werewolves & the lady who loves them both. Not to mention an exquisite flair of fashion! Makes me want to live in the Victorian era. Splendidly accomplished Puffed Parasol!
B0071XO8RA|5.0|This post-Apocalyptic mystery is as well-constructed as the Silo that lends this series its claustrophobic atmosphere.  This series is smart enough to keep even jaded readers engaged, with enough socioeconomic symbolism to make its conspiracies interesting in a literate way.
B006678VWA|5.0|I have purchased Deathly Hallows parts one and two from Amazon on blu-ray and the movies are great, etertaining and even fascinating.  What I particularly like about these Blu-ray versions are the extra bonus disks.  Hallows two comes with two such disks and all of them are thoroughly entertaining revealing \\"secrets\\" of making the films, hearing what the stars have to say about their roles and getting to see many of them without makeup.  I highly recommend purchasing both disks and then, get a nice cold drink, take the day off, put your feet up and enjoy spendning many exhilerating hours being entertained.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|I am a huge fan, can't wait for the next book to be released and I can sink back into the story.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|This is one of Grisham's better ones.  Ranks with Pelican Brief and The Firm.  Held interest and kept me wanting more.  Hard to put down.

B00B5A9FLY|5.0|Darker than the first four seasons, these episodes bring to an end the battle between Arthur and Morgana. Excalibur is returned to the Lady of the Lake and Merlin sees Arthur to Avalon to await his return as the &#34;once and future king&#34;. The series was purposely ended at the height of its popularity and if you become a fan you will be sad to see it end.
B005PK553C|5.0|Great story lines and charactors... I was hooked with the first pilot show!  Can't wait for season 3 to start.
B00B361HO8|5.0|I still prefer the presence that seems possible only with vinyl or very high fidelity digital files (above 48kHz/24 bit files) and this album demonstrates why.  Boz is supported by a host of outstanding Memphis musicians who know the traditions behind the music he and producer Steve Jordan are intent on capturing - which they do, beautifully.  Probably his best effort since Silk Degrees.  Highly recommended to all fans (though that recommendation is probably unnecessary) and an excellent way for those new to Boz Scaggs to meet his musical talent.  Outstanding.
B000AGTPUU|5.0|My son loves this and we watch it all year lucky me! Great for everyone who loves christmas and trains.
B000TV4MNG|5.0|I bought this for a friend who likes this movie and had just received a different version available at Amazon that had bad cropping and was an awful transfer quality to DVD.  Not only were they so much happier with this copy it arrived quickly and was able to be enjoyed on Easter.

B006MW3UZW|5.0|DA started a little slow, but now I look forward to every new episode!  Season 2 has improved compared to Season 1.
B00C1BU7V8|5.0|I'm sure you can only cover so much in a single movie.  I did like how the movie focused on the civil rights element, and captured a terrible time in history, but didn't leave you with that feeling.  I really love it when there is a good message in the movie, and unique stories that make a real impression.  Those are probably my best non political observations.
6305128952|5.0|As always Robert Redford did an outstanding performance and had an excellent script to work with.  It was all I thought the show would be and enjoyable evenings entertainment.
B004N7B8DY|4.0|This movie set the tone for kung fu flicks in America. Bruce Lee started a franchise that has flourished long after his death.  All hail the dragon!!!!!
034580404X|5.0|Great book for some rainy day, beach reading, bored at home dont want to watch tv reading great price arrived in a great condition.
B008JDAC7G|5.0|After seeing this on AS years ago I finally downloaded it on my phone to give it a try...and I haven't looked back since.  It's a simple matching game with some strange side graphics, but I am officially addicted to it now.  Play it for at least an hour a night and never get bored even though I'm essentially doing the same thing over and over.  Not much changes, but the combinations are endless and it retains its fun.  Definitely worth the money.
1401235425|5.0|I really liked this comic, the story and drawing are spectacular. I recommed this comic to any Batman Fan. It really worths it

Suzanne write great books and every book pairs I have read I'm sad when I'm done. I have read all of her books at least 3 times
B0011EP0S6|5.0|Once is one of the more brilliant movies I've seen in a long while. It's a love story without the mushy love and a musical without the cheesy-ness of a musical.

B008DW6VOQ|3.0|I'd REALLY like it if I could sort the quotes by %increase/decrease. As it is, I can only list alphabetically.
B00B9LNLTQ|5.0|This album is awesome. I'm a strokes fan since Is This It, and I couldn't wait for this album to come out. This is one of those albums you have to listen to several times for it to soak in. I'm not too much of an 80's fan but I can't get enough of this album. And to be honest I was a little worried if The Strokes were going to come back after Angles. Angles was a disappointment for me, it had some cool tracks, but the album just didn't feel \\"together\\", and there were some tracks that I skip every time which never happened with any of their other albums. There is only one track on this album that is a bit weak and that is Happy Ending. (In my opinion) But def worth the buy, I'll be listening to this for years to come... And so many people disregard First Impressions of Earth, but that is one of my all time favorites. That album is just as good as the first two. Every single track is amazing.
1250007208|5.0|THESE BOOKS. These books are simply AMAZING. To be fair, I had purchased CINDER (the first book in the series), just because I thought the cover looked really cool. Then I started to see really awesome reviews about it, so I thought, I'm going to pick that up and give it a go. MIND. BLOWN.<br /><br />The story is about a cybernetic-Cinderella who lives the future city of New Beijing. And the story is pretty much the way you would think it would be -- except much, much more exciting than the original. This story is in a dystopian world where robots, androids, and pretty much anything else you can think of all exist.  Cinder is a mechanic in the marketplace, repairing broken robots for the locals, when she meets Prince Kai there, who brings his android in on \\"a matter of national security\\".  Of course, the spark of an attraction occurs, with Kai not knowing that Cinder is part android.<br /><br />No Cinderella-esque story would be complete without the evil stepmother nor the stepsisters, of which Cinder has of course.  But while Cinder's stepmother is cruel and hates her, Cinder's stepsister Peony is kind towards her.  Unfortunately before the Annual Ball, Peony comes down with the plague that has been ravishing the country, and Cinder's stepmother blames her for Peony's illness. Seething, she volunteers Cinder up for plague research -- something which nobody ever has survived.<br /><br />Cinder soon finds herself in the midst of an intergalactic incident that's just waiting to boil over into war --- the Lunar Queen is desperate to get her hands on the Earth, and thinks that Prince Kai is the way to get what she wants.  And what will the scientists find when they use Cinder for research??<br /><br />The story segues into the story of Scarlet, a produce farmer from France, and the search for her missing grandmother.  Her search has her cross paths with a man named Wolf, who aids her in her search. Soon the worlds of Cinder and Scarlet will collide with both girls looking for their answers while dealing with the threat of intergalactic war.<br /><br />My point? These ain't momma's fairytales.  These are action-packed, exciting, and thrilling. I read them quickly, just with the need to know what happened to everyone next. The characters are well written, quick witted, and clever. My favourite character is that of Iko, Cinder's robotic sidekick, who doesn't seem to know she's not a teenage girl.  Bottom line, these books are like nothing you've ever read and probably like nothing you ever well. The wait for the next book in the series is going to be agonising for me. Marissa Meyer has me hooked on her future-world where anything is possible.ng for their answers while dealing with the threat of intergalactic war.<br /><br />My point?

B004D0YB4Y|5.0|A lot of people have never heard of this guy, and they should. I ended up seeing a video of his online and then bought the album. It's one of those albums that whether your 20 or 60, you will enjoy it forever. And eventually he came to my city to do a concert so I went and saw him, and it was just as good if not better than the album. He is a true musician in a time where those are getting fewer. Buy it if you like soul.
B00881PTRC|5.0|The only thing I would change would be the font color when you actually do wind up missing a word. Yellow on white background didn't really help me learn what word I missed. Other than that a wish list, this game is very enjoyable, thanks!
B00338QENI|5.0|Thoroughly loved this book.  Very interesting and sad how something like this can go on in todays world.  I am sure it happens all the time.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|my favorite book so far. i thought some characters that i liked would die... im glad they didnt buy it
B00BJS7104|5.0|already a Tarantino fan, i had high expectations. i was not disappointed. the traditional western story telling is vibrant in this film.
B005LAIISA|5.0|You have to watch this DVD. This is just as funny as all the other ice Age movies out there. They still can't seem to give Scrat a break. If you have not seen the others, I highly recommend viewing them as well. They are all simply amazing to watch.
B008ZOHCKE|5.0|you can make  as many notebooks as you want!!! you can also make it as many pages as you want. any color, and title. I recommend getting this app. :)

B004WGGQPQ|5.0|OMG OMG I luv this app!!! its awesome!!! I love it. and you don't need wi-fi either!!  its like awesome!
0670026603|5.0|One of those books that makes you say, \\"This is why I am a reader. This is why I love reading. This is the reward for the mediocre books, the are you kidding books. This makes me happy.\\" Happy, but oh so sad. Get the tissues out, I had to get up and get more. I am bereft. I miss the characters. I feel discombobulated. I am still mourning the end of the book. Thank you, JoJo Moyes, \\"Me Before You\\" is why I read. Read it, laugh, cry, enjoy, enjoy.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I love learning this stuff. its so awesome to know what He did for us. I have my own, but this app is awesome:) Haha watching Austin and Ally. Hehe! get it!!!
B0088XXCZ6|1.0|I know Fiona Apple can be eccentric, but this album is just way out there, and not in a good way.  There is only one song that I like in this album, and that is #1, Every Single Night.  She has an incredible voice, but this album is just way too out of the box for me.
B00AAQRNQ8|5.0|This Anker mouse is perfect. It comes with weights so you can customize your mouse to your liking. This mouse is also very smooth and reaction rate is instant. The 6ft cord is very durable. Also the three macro buttons on the thumb side of the mouse is perfect. The placement allows you to press these macro buttons without much effort. The only problem I have with the mouse is the lighting. Even though you can change the mouse colors and brightness to whatever you like, there are still lights on the mouse that you cannot turn off. But overall, this is an amazing mouse and I would highly recommend it to anyone no matter how often they game.
0345529057|5.0|I became interested in these books because of the HBO series.  So far the HBO series has followed closely to the books with a few minor differences.  I haven't finished the books yet but I am greatly enjoying the world and characters that Mr. Martin has created.<br /><br />I don't believe in spoilers, so I don't talk about story or character in book reviews.  I simply rate books based off of whether or not I find them enjoyable.  If you enjoy sword swinging, dragon fire breathing, magic throwing saga's, back stabbing twisted plots, this series of books should be good for you.
B0015GF4FO|5.0|I love the show, it's very entertaining and great acting from Gabriel Byrne. great appearances from lots of wonderful actors as the clients.
1476733953|5.0|From the opening chapter this book completely captured my attention, during Holston's initial ascent up the Silo. The character descriptions were amazing and the development of the story was absolutely phenomenal. I am not a huge Sci-Fi fan but I believe this book crosses boundaries and is pure storytelling genius. Hugh Howey's writing style is captivating and exciting and like most, if not all, of the 4500 + reviewers here have said, I simply could not put this book down. When I finished I immediately purchased Shift Omnibus Edition and devoured it as well.
B005LAIH4A|5.0|My kids have loved this movie. It was in great condition. They have watched it many times since we got it.
B001XCWPAM|1.0|I am extremely unhappy with Red Tag Market/Amazon.  I bought this for my dad's birthday and he calls to tell me it has locked up his blu-ray player and that the movies do not work!  How embarassing!!!<br /><br />I wanted to exchange it and they couldn't even exchange it!
B00499NHLC|4.0|This is a smart, funny show. The actors are perfect for their roles and the story lines are believable. My wife and I were home on a crappy day and decided to give this a try and we were hooked after the first episode.
B000HSKUBE|5.0|Watched this for the third time in 5 years. The era and some references  can seem dated (Here Margaret Thacher is retiring, while in my world we buried her last week). Aside from that, really well written, though evil story. It is hard to think politics is so scheming until you look at what has always been politics and remember that it is this way, if not worse.
B0081336FO|4.0|This is a smart, funny show. The actors are perfect for their roles and the story lines are believable. My wife and I were home on a crappy day and decided to give Season 1 a try and we were hooked after the first episode. The second season started to get a little hokey in terms of the plot lines. Some of the explanations were just too convenient or didn't make any sense at all. Overall, still a great show and I can't wait for the third season.
B008RA3X5E|5.0|Very helpful alarm clock because it is the best alarm clock for a tablet I have ever seen. Also very convenient

B0097UO87U|5.0|This popped up on Amazon as recommended for me.  I had sort of forgotten about Jeff Lynne and how much I liked him.  I read the reviews and listened to the samples.  And bought it.  Nice interpretation of old songs.
0062059963|5.0|I just finished this and I am hating myself for not making it last longer. The wait for book three is going to be pure torture. On that note I was terrified near the end, those that have read the book know what I am referring to, but I love this book and the characters, although I am not the biggest fan of Aspen. However, if you liked the first one, this is even better.
0062059963|5.0|Oh my god, I hate and I love, love it!!!<br />At times, I wanted to despise Maxon so much! And in the end, I don't know were to stand anymore. This book is clearly testing the feelings of America and Maxon. She's no longer the \\"first\\" anymore, well, he is keeping other options and it really killed me! Argh!<br />Can't wait for the last one (not before april 2014)! I truly hope America will be chosen. Aspen is lovely too but ..; I really want America to win and make a difference.<br />I expect the last one to be a hardship for America.<br /><br />Thank you for that beautiful story missis Cass but it's so hard to wait so long! Please, please, hurry up!

B008393Q2O|3.0|But it is the worst with drawing lines. IT only draws in straight lines connected at angled points, no smooth lines are available. I would recommend many other diary or note apps before using this one.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|As good as TV gets.<br /><br />Buy this DVD.  Watch it.  Then invite everyone over for 'Firefly' nights.<br /><br />Then loan the DVD out to share the joy.<br /><br />Fantastic series with a great follow up movie.
B00BLCHZC2|5.0|So well done that I bought it even though I can watch it on TV for free. It is excellent.
B0036S4C6G|5.0|Egan has an amazing talent for the short story form. Each chapter is new and interesting and well worth the time spent reading. Loved it, hope to pick it up again in the future.
B009AMANBA|5.0|Maybe every single congressman and senator should take a copy of Lincoln home and study the art of compromise, and get a bill done for the good of the country!
B008AK8FHM|3.0|This book was boring.  I'm a strong Christian but this was really slow reading.  I kept waiting for it to pick up, but found it very slow.
B00AZNEW5G|5.0|One of the most exciting movies I have seen this year! Not only is Jessica Chastain beautiful, but also becoming one of our best actresses! Everyone should see this movie to honor our elite forces! See what these men and women do to protect us!
B008IBPMZG|5.0|Like so many others, I just can't stop watching this show. It's a complete masterpiece. Don't watch unless you are willing to spend hours in front of the television.
B00BU18U82|5.0|It is a good way for everyone to learn the aspect of farming.  You might consider changing the model of tractor to a John Deere or Case International.  The Duetz has been out of business for a good number of years.  Not a popular model of tractor any more.  At least in the USA
B009FZHYKU|5.0|My brother got me hooked on to this show and now i am a true deadhead! There is never a dull moment and every corner is full of surprises. From what ive heard, it is pretty true to the comic story line. I cant wait for season 4!
B00CBKXGPI|2.0|Really enjoy the game but it closes on me and freezes.  Can't wait for the update with the bug fix
B000SEIK2S|3.0|Old Man's War has an interesting concept. In the future, humans are one of many races in the galaxy, all looking to take over as much real estate as possible. To fight their battles, the human colonists recruit 75-year-olds from Earth and give them young bodies. Most don't survive the bloody, violent wars very long.<br /><br />I'm not a fan of war books in general, and Old Man's War is a war book through and through. The technologies described and the concept is interesting, but I couldn't find it in myself to care about... anything. John's okay as a protagonist, I suppose, but he's not particularly memorable. The other characters are like blocks of wood with faces painted on them, as though someone tried so hard to give them personality. As for the plot... the whole ongoing war thing just didn't do it for me. There was no real cause being fought for, and if even the characters aren't invested in the fight, how can I be expected to give a damn?<br /><br />All in all, I have very mixed feelings about this book. It's imaginative enough, I suppose, but despite the grandiose wars, the stakes just felt  low.
B00C7TAF3Y|4.0|The Room is a wonderfully constructed set of puzzles within a puzzle. The graphics are very well done, and the sound effects keep you engaged. This is is a terrific app well worth the price!
B000PY6BBI|5.0|Starts slow, but gets better. We both liked it. Kept our attention. The premise was interesting. We found ourselves rooting for the main characters.
0062059963|5.0|I really like America's character overall and I'm loving Maxon more and more. A lot of things that happened in the story that I wasn't expecting and I am glad happened. The character development in this book was great and it wasn't a boring middle book. The only thing that dissapoints me is that I have to wait a whole year to see how it all ends.... I can't wait!!! A must read!!
B00ATSBIIG|4.0|Imagine played the original version of this game. This version has been provided by the wonderful programmers at Bigfish Games. This version is much better than the previous one which was really cheaply made and had the worst background music (imagine elevator music in a movie from the 1970s). The other much improved aspect is the ability to choose the texture of the puzzle. I really like being given the multiple options (glass, wood, stone, ...). The new puzzle layouts are beautiful. I for one would like to thank the gamemakers for a first-class job. The only thing missing is the ability to preview the puzzle you are working on.
B00BJS7104|5.0|And I loved it.  Over the top blood, grind house at it's finest mixed into major cinema!  One of the few movies I will watch time and time again.  So long as my wife isn't around.

B003U53GK8|5.0|We've seen the entire series 3 times and never get bored with it.  Out of all the episodes, there is only one we would skip.

B00B49GSOS|1.0|The LOTR trilogy was amazing, and I expected this to be equally good. It is horrible. Far too much time spent on battles and action sequences of different types, with virtually none of it advancing the plot. Did I say plot? I'm being kind.<br />The screen play is absolute garbage. Based on the lousy screen play, everything else faltered and sank. Too bad, because the potential was there.<br />I tried to accept this as a stand-alone story rather than anything related to The Hobbit novel, but it is a dismal failure. It fails as an adaption, and it fails as a stand-alone. It isn't even watchable! I had to fast-forward through most of it, looking for something that might be plot. There wasn't much.<br />How could Jackson have screwed up so badly? I won't bother renting the next part. I hope another screen writer and director -- maybe one of the Harry Potter ones -- will make an enjoyable version of this classic book.<br />I almost hope the Tolkien family sues.
B00BJS7104|5.0|The movie though a serious subject matter, I found to be funny at times and very intense in some of the scenes. I thoroughly enjoyed it and have watched it several times since purchasing it. Kudos to Jaime Foxx, Sam Jackson and the rest of the cast on a job well done.
B00BHU261S|3.0|Like many people I've seen most of Hitchcock's films and enjoyed them.  But I knew very little about him.  This film is an interesting biography of Hitchcock during the creation of the script and the filming of &#34;Psycho&#34; which was his most famous film.<br /><br />The acting is great but the story is only good.  Hitchcock had trouble convincing Paramount that Psycho would be successful.  Many people thought the story too strange and too brutal.  In any case it did get filmed and it did become a success.<br /><br />Much of the movie deals with the relationship between Hitchcock and his wife, a gifted director in her own right who helped get Psycho back on track.  Their marriage was somewhat rocky but so are many marriages.<br /><br />The supporting cast who played Janet Leigh and Anthony Perkins did a good job too.  There were also strange &#34;flashbacks&#34; involving Ed Gein, the murderer whose life was more or less the origin of the Psycho story.  The actor who played Gein did a good job in a very unrewarding role.<br /><br />Overall the film was interesting but not as interesting as perhaps it might have been.  No doubt if Hitchcock himself had directed it the story would have been more powerful.  Even so it held my interest and I learned things about Hitchcock that I had not known about before.<br /><br />One scene was very funny at the end.  Hitchcock was giving a monologue about lacking inspiration for his next film.  It would be a spoiler to say what happened but those who know Hitchcock's films will have no trouble figuring out which movie came next.
B00AKL1XPU|4.0|This game is great I love it. Just one thing missing roller coasters then I will love it so there
B00881PTRC|4.0|The words must be random.  My first few words have been challanging - I'm an adult and Ive been hung once already.<br />Animations when you miss a letter are very clever.<br />No problems (yet) with font color and background.<br />I like it!

B004J4WKTW|5.0|This was a really interesting book. Amazing characters with great story lines. This is a true love story between two people destined to end but you can't help but root for them.
B0054SMIH6|2.0|After reading the book and reading some of the other Amazon reviews I decided to watch this movie.  I was very disappointed in the result.  The movie plot did not provide for charter development and was more of a cartoon or TV show version of the book.  The plot it self was a shallow as the characters.  All in all a waste of my time.  There are better dramas on FX to be watched then to spend time on this movie.
B007SGM084|5.0|All accounts all of the books are a great read. A refreshing change from the usual so called romance novels.
B0064MPXFA|5.0|Love this show. A lot of great actors and great writing.  Another great show that I was missing out on until now.
B00CDT41RY|4.0|I really enjoyed this movie. Good story, very good acting. My wife  enjoyed the movie but did not really care for the graphic violence. I forget waht it's rated but definitely should be &#34;R&#34; but very good action packed adult movie
B004UHL9EK|5.0|Very quick, easy and convenient to use for all types of tasks. I use it at work, home and the gym.
B00BP4X3W2|3.0|This is a very good movie but it is an older one and I enjoyed it much more the first time I saw it.
B007REV4YI|5.0|This is an action packed movie, with great effects and acting. I truly Like Daniel Craig's take on 007. Just when you think the movie has come to its conclusion it takes off again for another roller coaster ride.
0385335989|5.0|The entire Outlander series was a treasure to find!  The books are so full of detail and I love Diana Gabaldon's style of writing.  She has clearly done her research to make each time period she writes about so real like you are there when you read it.  This will be a series I can read over again given that it would be impossible to absorb all the details in the first read!
B00BEZTMQ8|5.0|I truly enjoyed this movie. It's wonderful to go back to Middle Earth. It does not follow the book in every way, but is fun to see on its own merits.
B004ZN9W5M|5.0|What can I say?  The tape wore out, so I had to replace it with a CD!  This is just a classic PF and if you enjoy the group it should surely be part of your collection.
B005S9EKCW|5.0|The scope and feel of the movie was amazing. The acting was top notch. I especially enjoyed the raw feel of the music. It would not have been as good if done by opera type singers. The movie cleared up some things I had missed in seeing the on stage plays, not to forget you can see and feel the the emotion, as you are so close to the performers. I understood the lyrics much better too. This is a gritty movie, with themes, language, and emotion that might be too much for younger viewers.
B003ZJ0ZX0|5.0|I have only discovered Bruno Mars this past year and I enjoy him so much.  What an entertainer!  It's like I fell in love with the guy the first time I saw him on SNL.  For me it was love at first sight.  I know he will go a long way.  His voice is strong and clear and I look forward to seeing him again.

1400069807|5.0|Reading Salt, Sugar, Fat, it's clear why its author, Michael Moss, won a Pulitzer for his earlier investigative journalism (about the beef industry). This is a meticulously researched, highly detailed account of how we've been manipulated by the big processed food companies in a calculated and cynical manner for close to a century. And the current obesity/diabetes epidemic is one of the most visible and pernicious results.<br /><br />But according to Moss's account, the food giants (think Kellogg's, General Mills, Post, Oscar Mayer, etc.) don't care much about the health of their customers. All that matters to them is their bottom line, and they fight tooth and nail any attempts to mandate informing their customers about ingredients or regulating their products to make them healthier. Instead, they will deflect attention from the fact that, say, the cereal your kid demands may be 40% sugar, by touting that it's low fat or has a taste kids love or can help keep them alert in school (the \\"findings\\" of a \\"study\\" that was funded by Big Food to justify the high sugar content in its breakfast cereals). They know that by overloading their products with sugar, salt and fat, they are tapping into evolutionary mechanisms pegged to human survival, and our brains are no match for those basic drives. So these companies continue to bombard us with the very tastes and ingredients we are wired to crave, no matter how damaging their products may be, because it translates into big, big profits.<br /><br />Moss deftly traces the history of processed food and how we have come to rely on its convenience, at the expense of our health. There's a lot of content here, but his prose is eminently readable, and if you're like me, you'll be outraged at what he reveals. Salt, Sugar, Fat is an important book--one that attempts to illuminate the truth about the foods that we as a nation too often consume mindlessly. If I have one gripe, it's that there isn't enough about what we can do to combat the problem, other than refusing to eat processed foods.<br /><br />Five enthusiastic stars. Here's hoping Moss tackles the GMO crisis next.
B006GWO5NE|5.0|The charger works quickly and is stable in Kindle ports. ;-)  I got it as a free replacement for my original charger that came with my Kindle Fire.
B001FVV2X2|4.0|Very good science fiction (which always precedes science).  The actors are excellent and believable in the roles they are playing.  The series is well directed and entertaining.  I really like it and am looking forward to Season 2.
B000Y5JFNE|5.0|This is one of my all time favorite sword and sorcery films!  It blended the action and locations like in Conan, the atmosphere and magic of Legend with the comical sense of Princess Bride into one film.  I would have taken 1 star away only for the bonus features.  It would really have been nice if they could have done more for bonus material, mostly just ported from the previous release.  But picture quality was very well done, almost too well as it revealed a couple effects to be a tad weak.  Even still those moments are very brief and do not distract from the movie as a whole which has aged well otherwise.  A great deal of care was given to restoring this film and it shows, just wish they could have gotten Val and some of the others together for commentary or interviews, that would have made this release even better.

B00BMKDTNC|5.0|I have enjoyed this series from the first volume. Good character development, good plots and sub plots. Good all the way to the end.
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|I am still playing the game,  but decided to review now.  Thought about giving it a four star a while back due to a little mess up...on my part.  Really like these match games and this one doesn't. disappoint.  Well worth the money...Just wonder when I will finish as its a long One!
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Easy levels for beginners and challenging levels for others. Good for kids &amp; adults. Glad I downloaded this app! Awesome
B004LROUW2|4.0|Although incredibly long winded....odd that one of the supporting characters is an editor... the novel does make sense. The outcome is well known as is every major plot line, but still the author makes it interesting enough to pull you through all the words. Thematically complex. Detailed but not ornate. As counter intuitive as it may seem, a 1200 page piece that is 'spare'. Could be the result of translation, but I'll take it. To be sure, 'repetitive' is a justified criticism, and though the construct is casual, it's not a casual read.<br /><br />An interesting book. When I recover from this one I'll read another of Murakami's offerings.
B009IJJ5B4|5.0|I grew up reading Sherlock Holmes, I really dreamed about being Sherlock. Then the show from BBC called Sherlock came along and I could not see anything getting better than Sherlock... then i watched Elementary. My only complaint is the episodes are not longer.<br />The Chemistry between the characters is really amazing. I can not tell if I want the characters to get together BUT I enjoy the heck out of them working cases together. i would really suggest giving this show a shot.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I'm not one with many words or correct grammar, but I must say this series consumed me and I love that she took the story all the way to the end.  No questions left unanswered.  Very well written.
B008Y79HE6|4.0|I always hear how people hated this movie, I was the exception to this. I was really bummed when they said they would not be doing a sequel.
B005K17RU0|5.0|Detailed hourly reports, which are pretty consistent and reliable reports. Loads quickly and does not have annoying ads to contend with.
006114665X|5.0|Being age 86, German-born, I went through WW II as a young German soldier including bombing, flak, infantry and seeing much destruction. Clearly Hitler started WW II in 1939 but I always wondered how Europe tumbled into WW I after which so much tragedy followed. I had only sketchy ideas, but &#34;The Sleepwalkers&#34; gave me the answer I wanted,in more detail than I needed or could really digest.<br /><br />Positives: The truly vast and diverse amount of research. The absorbing story of the assassination, e.g. down to the telling detail that the archduke's car had no reverse gear when it needed to back out of a street, and other highlights of actions or remarks spoken. The author deserves major kudos! The book's title is superb!<br /><br />Negatives: Despite the above, the middle part of the book is overwritten, i.e. mentioning too many ministers and personalities by name, and too often, even for the smallest nuance of view,  so that I got lost. A separate &#34;cast of characters&#34;  or organization table would have helped.<br /><br />Who was the worst bum? The book clearly does not hang the debt alone around Germany's neck. All major European nations, Russia included, dangerously veered back and forth between peace and war desires in the book, much more than I ever was aware. The internal disparities of ministers' views, unclear authorities, superficial and often irresponsible attitudes toward war's blood and suffering, unrealistic expectations of combat results, all added up to a pathetic, tragic outcome - 15+ million casualties, three empires lost, a world order destroyed, and more.<br /><br /> Britain, and surprisingly even Germany, appear as - relatively speaking - peace-seeking nations at least for a while. All the nations had gone through war experiences not too long before 1914, yet, whatever they suffered, did not keep them from &#34;sleepwalking&#34; into another one, and the worst one yet.<br /><br />All future ministers with war responsibilities should, somewhere, first visit three front line military hospitals, then three military morgues, then a dozen families of fallen soldiers.
B00AIJP9BS|3.0|Foosball was something I moved to play in order to kill time and hang out as I grew up. This game while a decent idea lacks the fast pace and the rush of a good foosball game. The controls are a bit stiff, and the game feels more like turn taking than it does active back and forth like a real foosball game.<br /><br />To me the theme feels that it is trying to borrow from the success of angry birds which made me a bit skeptical to start with. I'd play a lite  version of this before buying.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|Great book. Hooks you in and never let's you go. Mr. Landay did an outstanding job with the plot. Perhaps a little extra work on editing would be my only &#34;con&#34;.
B004J4WN0I|4.0|This book kept me entertained. It was non stop twist and the main character Atticus is not a wimp. I recommend this book.
B00AF6B2BK|5.0|Powerslave marks a band maturing from youthful upstarts into masters of their genre. It has a great mix of catchy, melodic, sharp tracks like Aces High and complex epics like the title track. This album really was the foundation of the rest of Maiden's career, and should be in any metal fan's collection.
B00CDT41RY|5.0|If you like Tarantino you will enjoy this movie. Unfortunately, it is kind of long though at just under 3 hours.
B003JTHESA|4.0|Like others I thought this was only OK when I first listened but it grew on me a lot. It follows a similar sound to their post reunion albums, and perhaps isn't as strong as some of those, but is still a very respectable effort. Maiden's consistency after 30 years is incredible.
B00AHTYI5M|4.0|I very much enjoyed this true story. I thought it was amazing that all of the myriad parts of the CIA's \\"plot\\" did indeed come together at the last minute, so the Americans could be rescued- (and thank goodness!). I was riveted throughout the film and thought it was quite well done. Let's hear it for wild ideas! Many lives were saved by that agent.
B00APUQRPC|4.0|I liked this movie overall, it was serious, but did not take self too serioously. Amy was clearly nervous in this role and might have been a miscast, but I like her and I still liked it. Justin was very natural on screen and did not work to hard at it - as a support character. Clint was Clint right down to the bar fight, I laughed pretty hard at that. It was a frustrated with Father-want his approval formula movie...Finding Nemo was better. But it was worth the cost to rent it.<br />Enjoy.<br />JB
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Love being able to listen to the Bible as well as read it.  I really love having this on my Kindle.
B006OOHYIC|4.0|Fallen Tree actually improved on the original, which I really liked, incorporating elements from other hit games like Jetpack Joyride into the progress of the game. Do yourself a favor and wait to play the hidden levels until you have finished the game, they are really challenging. Great Look, Great Interface, Great Music, Great game.<br />Enjoy.<br />JB
B005K17RU0|3.0|Nice app but sloooow. I think every time it starts up it tries to use GPS which is disabled.  There should be an option to not use location services.<br /><br />3 stars because of this.
B00ADQCBEY|5.0|Love the different facets of police work. Police in &#34;blue&#34; vs. detectives. The different plots are awesome. Final series with Vic and covering up his dirty past gets tiring though. But that's where CCH Pounder comes through for the rest of the show! Thanks CCH!!
B000I9WW0E|5.0|What needs to be said other then you get it or your just like Donnie and are out of your element.
B007QDNKQA|5.0|This is one of the best movies I have seen.  I watch it over and over.  It has those great lines if you have every played who movie did this line come from, i.e. &#34;Maybe I should wait for the report to come out and then tell you what I remember&#34; Action packed, great acting, just an overall good movie!
1405853115|1.0|I bought this book with great expectations because I'm very interested in the subject of ELT but my dissapointment was huge! I found it so superficial... Harmer has created an extensive book based on his fame and reputation but nothing else. Surely he must know a lot, but he's missed the point as a writer. The book is extremely tedious and dull, there's no spark, no vision, no motivation, it could be said that the author just hates to teach, because it's so difficult to find any passion in those gullible and twisted obscure lines. At least, if it could have been a smart and profound theoretical book with a deep academic background, it would've been worth, but it fails on that too. Most of the explanations are so obvious and simple that they're not worth your time and believe me, he takes a huge amount of words to explain the simplest idea wasting your time again.<br /><br />How can a book that talks about English teaching not say anything about literature?, story-telling? or the use of games in the classroom as fundamental resources to use? Nothing, it doesn't say a simple word about it!!! And the book has 488 damn pages and is very expensive to put it worse. In an attempt to provide some feedback to the author I posted a polite comment on his blog... but... he didn't seem to like that someone could disagree with his celestial point of view about language teaching and his answer was far-far away from what you should expect from a teacher of his level. To put it simple: He attacked my \\"English\\", even though I'm not a native speaker!! Incredible! So humble!<br /><br />Normally, I'm not so negative about a book, but this one I just hate it!
B000FCK65W|4.0|I read this because it was a book group selection for me.  I lived in Queens, NY for a couple of years and found this book interesting to read because of some familiar locations (subway stops, bridges, etc.).  I think it is well written and very descriptive and somewhat contemporary in the subjects it covers.  Glad to have read it.
B001QU4ZVS|5.0|I really enjoyed discovering Madeleine Peyroux recently through a promotion on Facebook via Amazon Mp3.  I enjoy the different genres she covers and the style in which she delivers them.  I will be sure to purchase more Mp3 albums of hers.

B0064MPXFA|5.0|High on plot and character development, low on sex and violence. Acting, writing, all first-rate.  I'm a big fan. I only wish I could figure out why the kid is keeping the evidence of his Dad's innocence secret.
B00B2G2RG6|4.0|Didn't think I would like this type of thing, but the character sketches and the gripping story line really pull you in.  Amazing for a network show to be this compelling to watch.
B009NG1Q96|5.0|This book is solo amazing. I can nit wait for book three. It is so sad that I will have to wait for a while. I can't wait to see what happens. This book was full of crazy things and seriously intense moments. I laughed out loud, cried actual tears and yelled out in fury. Keira Cass is amazing as ever. Definitely a must read!

B009JZTOG8|5.0|I never get to watch prime time TV so I downloaded the entire 1st season and watched it in the space of a week. I was hooked. I debated purchasing the entire 2nd season at once but ultimately decided to download one episode at a time, in case I lost interest. I've only watched a few episodes but so far I'm still &#34;enchanted&#34;. All of the characters have undergone subtle shifts in personality and their roles which adds a depth and subtlety. The only caveat is not to bother with Episode 1 unless you can't recall anything from Season 1. It's a 45 minute trailer recapping the first season and had I known that beforehand, I would not have bothered to download it.

B0091REZMW|4.0|Works well on the kindle. Energy is a little slow but I don't spend hours playing games anyhow so it works for me.
B007HGPBRC|5.0|Christopher Hitchens has courageously, stunningly,and excellently communicated his thoughts and feelings about his diagnosis of Stage 4<br />Esophageal cancer. What makes the book stand out among so many of &#34;inspirational&#34; books, where the author has an incurable disease is his willingness to fight to the end to try to conquer the disease, even while he reckons with the liklihood that he will not survive.  And all the while his strong atheistic beliefs ride shotgun to his profound experiences.  He has made the best case for atheism that I've ever encountered, even while he faces a likely demise.  Very gripping stuff;  very honest and quite profound...and moving even as he succumbs<br />in the end.
B0073XORCY|5.0|Great gift!  I bought this for my dad for Christmas and he loved it as much as I hoped he would.
B006M7JCC2|5.0|I heard Anita Moorjani talk about her near death experience early this year. I found her to be sincere and felt genuinely moved by her message.  I bought her book to learn more about the details of her experience and then bought two other copies to give to family.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|This is a beautiful story, very sweet and heartbreaking at the same time. Very unique and defintely one of my all time favorite books.
B002UM5BXW|4.0|Read this but definitely read medium raw afterwards, otherwise you will have a very skewed and outdated view of what it's like to cook in real kitchens today!
B000001FYL|5.0|I have listened to this so much I wore out my other copy. Glad to have it again. Great cd!
B007ZXK08C|4.0|An unusual and un-put-downable book.  Took me by surprise and then kept me enthralled throughout.  I never knew what was coming next.  Loved it except for the end. I didn't really get it so I found it disappointing.  It may work if the author writes a sequel.
B0095P31L6|5.0|Really enjoyed this animated feature.  I really liked the different levels of humor and my son was enthralled by the clorful nature & action scenes of the movie.  Johnny Depp is perfect as Rango
B008Y79IUE|3.0|Worth watching but just there are much better movies out. Netflix really needs to update movies available. They are too limited in what they have.
B008JFUO4U|4.0|saw this movie monday. my wife and i like cruise so wanted to see this in the movies........not to much to say except, very well done.  nice directing and well acted, good fx.  was surprised that this is ready to order already........but, good price for the bluray/dvd and a chance to see this again and again when it comes out, so had to order this as soon as i saw it here.
B004QBWU02|1.0|The movie is almost too dark to watch. The whole movie takes place at night which makes it even worse. I wish I could get my money back. Adjusting the brightness on your TV doesn't help. Don't buy this DVD.
B00BHMETKC|4.0|I felt like I was there and the stuff was real. Tension kept me on the edge of my seat.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|After watching the movie I thought this book would be very similar, I should have known better. I loved the movie and loved the book and they are very different. I found this book very in lightening and emotional. Highly recommend!
B00B5HQKNI|2.0|To the new makers of James Bond movies: Get over yourselves. At least Sean Connery's tongue was firmly in cheek as his car dumped oil and nails and other doubtful things happened.
B000FA675C|5.0|I read this book some time ago but I can say that I enjoyed reading it  because you didn't know what to expect next. Kept you on the edge of your seat throughout.
B009RI4FRU|5.0|I about fell out when Edward Norton first walked out of his tent in his spiffy little shorts. Quite a change from previous roles.
B004XUMMFE|5.0|I am on my second time watching this show and still find myself entertained.  I keep saying that it's too bad a good show like this only had one season.  The cast is likeable, and their characters are interesting.  There is humor, action, drama, and suspense all wrapped up in a sci-fi universe that could be a believable future setting.  Only bad thing I can say about it is their aren't enough episodes.
B0063IH60K|4.0|Very simple solitaire game.  No frills, works just like if I was playing with a deck of cards.  great to play when you don't want to get deeply involved with a game.
B00APUYWYA|5.0|Loved this movie.. Wasnt sure what to expect.. But was SUPER happy I watched it.. A must see movie for a ton of laughs..
B00BQPEIT2|5.0|My granddaughter loves this game.  She is 8 years old and the first time she played it she got up to level 10.  I can't seem to get past level 2.  Oh, to be young again.  LOL
B000FC1HBY|5.0|I chose the five star rating because the writing is superb.<br /><br />Perfect in that the women are real, round women. Flawed and smart and fierce, they are written just as the men are written, as individuals affected by their society. It's wonderful.<br /><br />The story makes sense... its fantasy, but it's realistic fantasy, insomuch as fantasy can be realistic. Te detail is astounding, I can see it unfolding before my eyes, never distracted by weird grammar or stodgy characterization.<br /><br />The only negative thing I can say is that it is not for the faint of heart. There is graphic violence and sex (the sex isn't so graphic as the violence, usually), and several mentions of violent rape. But it's treated tastefully. Some characters find it funny--these are cruel characters for the most part--some find it horrendous, etc.<br /><br />Proceed with caution, but all in all, a lovely lovely series.
B008MEM24S|5.0|I really like this game.  It is fun and very challenging, trying to direct the water/steam flow and collect all the gnomes and special items.
B00785P2QC|5.0|This game is truly one of those games you can't put down. I would tell anyone about this. It's definitely worth the time
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|The costumes, characters and location are all an exceptional compliment to the story, which keeps you coming back for more.
B009GEFXLC|5.0|Superb.  The inter-play between cast members is extraordinary.  Sure hope there will be many more seasons.  This is my favorite series on TV.
B000JMKQX0|5.0|Overall I really enjoyed the style and format that Brooks wrote the book in. I especially liked how the book did not have any main character(s) but instead shifted the viewpoints around and at different timeline too. The was also the feeling of desperation and dread as I read the different viewpoints, it didn't quite hit home but it was there. Overall it was a good read and definitely one I'll recommend to friends.
B001BKG9RQ|4.0|The first disc is basically On An Island live and is blah.  The second disc is classic Floyd, with some rarities performed better than ever!
B001ANSSDC|3.0|This book was okay; it failed to really grab my interest.  I've heard a lot of good things about the movie, and now I'm not really interested in seeing it.  Too many things in &#34;Silver Linings&#34; were beyond my belief - many of which were critical to the plot.
B00632HWOG|3.0|Darn - this app (which I really think is good layout/design) works on my Kindle Fire HD perfectly fine, but doesn't work on my old Kindle Fire model.  I would prefer the opposite since the Kindle Fire HD stock email is actually pretty good also, but was looking for something better on my older Kindle Fire.  Hopefully there's some bug that's easy to fix.  On the older Kindle Fire model, it just constantly says \\"Loading...\\" and never loads any of my emails.  Would be glad to give it more stars (4 or 5) if it worked on both models the same way!
B00BTYP6QE|5.0|I love this. They keep getting better with every version. The challenges are greater and don't disappoint. I'll keep coming back for more.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|This was just great science fiction and great addictive reading. Its a stellar premise and Howey takes it in all sorts of directions you never see coming. I loved the style and the tone and attention to detail. Plus the main character is an awesome hero. This will make such a great movie; I'm very excited that Ridley Scott found it and appreciated the brilliance.<br /><br />If you like the Rush song 2112, you will see some parallels in this story. Maybe Howey is a Rush fan...
B005ZOBNOI|3.0|It is okay.  It is written for young adults (teenagers) so I am probably not the best to write a review for this book. I liked that the author depicted the teenagers as being respectful and intelligent.  There were some scenes that just did not make since to me.
B0087IT8FK|1.0|ONly because it was in French - and I thought I ordered it in English.  I really loved this movie!  and want it in English, wanting to share it with people who need something uplifting, funny, intelligent, and hopeful.  And its taken from real life.
B000FC12ZA|1.0|I found out after a friend told me this was a good non-fiction read, in fact it's fiction.  All over the internet, even the author admitted it was made up.
B008Y7N7JW|1.0|I knew a bit about the storyline before watching the movie, but I did not like the idea that 24 teenagers fight to the death. One comes out on top. I did not read the book, so I don't know how close it was to storyline of the book.
B003L77FYS|5.0|I am such a Castle fan that I have about wore out the DVD.  This is such a fun DVD and will hook you on the the show.  Caskett is a couple like no other on TV.  This is worth every penny.
B007VUCAVO|5.0|Best battery monitor you can get. The free version is excellent but I decided to buy the pro version to support the developers. It's well worth it.
B009UAO1ZG|4.0|Lynne Olson's  Those Angry Days brought to light the interplay between the isolationists and inventionist in the days leading up to the U S's entry into WW II.  It is well researched and well written.
B00AHTYI5M|3.0|I think I know why \\"Argo\\" won the Academy Award for Best Picture. Hollywood loves itself. It loves movies about itself. And it really loves movies where Hollywood helps the CIA save the day.<br /><br />In fact, you can practically hear the producers squealing whenever cynical Hollywoodites appear in \\"Argo,\\" helping set up a sensitive operation to rescue innocent Americans from peril. The movie itself is a fairly decent dramatization of a real-life rescue from Iran, but ironically the halfhearted Hollywood qualities are also what bogs down the story.<br /><br />When the United States gives asylum to the dying Shah of Iran, a militant mob retaliates by attacking the American Embassy in Tehran. Six people escape to the Canadian ambassador's house, but they have no way of getting home -- if they even try to step outside, they will be recognized and killed.<br /><br />So the State Department calls on Tony Mendez (Ben Affleck), a CIA specialist who immediately shoots down all their idiotic ideas. He has the kind of idiotic idea that you seriously think Hollywood made up: pretend to be a team of Canadian filmmakers scouting for locations for a sci-fi/fantasy movie. Yes, seriously. With no better ideas on the table, the government reluctantly gives approval.<br /><br />With the help of film producer Lester Siegel (Alan Arkin) and make-up artist John Chambers (John Goodman), Mendez sets up a fake studio, fake casting, and a terrible script called \\"Argo.\\" Posing as a producer, Mendez infiltrates Iran with a bunch of fake Canadian passports -- but one slip could mean death for him and the hostages.<br /><br />I admit to knowing very little about the real-life hostage situation, because it happened long before I was born. But even before being dramatized by Hollywood, it's a pretty bizarre story -- and I doubt Hollywood could have found a more ideal movie to lavish praise on. After all, it's about Hollywood helping save the day from Evil Middle-Easterners!<br /><br />And the movie is genuinely well-done, especially once we get to Tehran -- there is a palpable sense of tension, as if Mendez and the hostages are dancing over tripwires. You really feel the delicate situations that are arising, and how the slightest mistake could get everyone killed. And despite the truly ridiculous \\"making a movie\\" idea (complete with costumes!), director/actor Ben Affleck does manage to handle it with a straight face.<br /><br />However, it also suffers from some excessively cheesy dialogue (\\"No, I was screaming his name 'cause I was f***ing him\\"), and some hideously awkward attempts at character development. The whole \\"absentee daddy\\" subplot is just so painfully Hollywood, as is the scene where the plane tickets are approved JUST IN THE NICK OF TIME, or when the Iranian guards chase them all the way to the plane.<br /><br />And while it attempts to show that the greatest victims of tyranny in Iran are its people, almost all the Iranians we see are either beady-eyed, bearded thugs or ravening rage-zombie mobs. It's just one of many hoary old cliches that are trotted out here.<br /><br />Ben Affleck was starring as well as directing here, and he does an excellent job job -- he's subtle and low-key, especially during the scenes where they try to sneak through an airport. Most of the other notable performances are from the Hollywood \\"characters,\\" namely Arkin and Goodman; the government suits are honestly hard to tell apart, and rarely do much except bluster.<br /><br />\\"Argo\\" is a solid thriller with a quietly compelling, intense style, and Affleck does a good job juggling direction and acting. But the onslaught of cliches leaves you acutely aware that this is a Hollywood movie, and the kind they love best.vie is genuinely well-done, especially once we get to Tehran -- there is a palpable sense of tension, as if Mendez and the hostages are dancing over tripwires.

B006LSZECO|4.0|I enjoyed this book because the plot is so unique. I loved how the author didn't allow you too much inside the character's minds early on, it kept me intrigued. It is a twisted book making it a nice page turner.
B00C2IL7SC|4.0|Like everyone else in the world, I instantly went cross-eyed at the idea of Guy Ritchie making a Sherlock Holmes movie.<br /><br />Sure enough, this is not your dad's Sherlock. Or your grandpa's either. \\"Sherlock Holmes\\" is a thoroughly eccentric take on the legendary detective -- energetic, action-packed and clever, with more than a hint of steampunk and black magic. It gets kind of silly at times, but Robert Downey Jr. and Jude Law keep the story going strong.<br /><br />As the story opens, a young woman is about to be sacrificed in a black magic ritual by the evil Lord Blackwood (Mark Strong). However, Sherlock Holmes (Downey) and Watson (Law) thwart him just in time for the police to arrive. Three months later, Blackwood is executed -- but not before he tells Holmes that three more people will die, and the world will change.<br /><br />But then his tomb is broken open... from the inside. And at the same time, Irene Adler (Rachel McAdams) tries to hire Holmes to track down a man who is then found dead in Blackwood's tomb. As Holmes tries to unravel this case, he discovers the existence of a strange upper-crust magical cult, who are slowly being killed off by Blackwood's mysterious powers. Has Sherlock Holmes run up against supernatural forces he cannot explain or fight?<br /><br />This is not an adaptation of one of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's stories -- this is more a movie that takes the IDEA of Sherlock Holmes and applies it to a big, bombastic, quirky action movie. Ritchie directs the movie with a sharp, kinetic style, and he keeps things from getting too stuffy with lots of fight scenes (including Holmes mapping out every fight in his head before throwing a punch).<br /><br />His steampunky vision of London has a lot of dark, dripping corners, and Ritchie happily trots Sherlock and Watson down into them -- river boats, Parliament's basement, and grimy rituals down in some catacombs. The movie's biggest problem is that the action sometimes gets silly, such as the massive fight at the shipyard in which Holmes and Watson almost get run over by a ship.<br /><br />But he balances out all the action with plenty of funny moments (Holmes repeatedly paralyzing poor Gladstone) and witty dialogue (\\"No girl wants to marry a doctor who can't tell if a man's dead or not!\\"). This is definitely a movie that loves Holmes at his most eccentric.<br /><br />The main reason this works so well is because of Downey. He is probably one of the best actors of our age, and he gives Sherlock a bright-eyed, quirky, almost manic energy, as well as a touch of Asperger's (he literally CANNOT understand why Watson would want to get married and retire from crimefighting). You can truly believe that this guy has a brain like a supercomputer.<br /><br />Law also gives an excellent performance as a young, vital Watson who seems to have a love-hate relationship with Holmes -- they're best friends, but Holmes' eccentricities are driving him nuts. Rachel McAdams gives a solid performance as Holmes' lady thief ex-girlfriend, and Mark Strong is wonderfully, sonorously sinister as the villain, who may or may not be a sorcerer.<br /><br />\\"Sherlock Holmes\\" isn't actually based on any Sherlock Holmes stories, but Guy Ritchie's sharp-edged direction and Downey's quirky performance make it a fun experience. Just try to swallow the sillier action scenes.e massive fight at the shipyard in which Holmes and Watson almost get run over by a ship.<br /><br />But he balances out all the action with plenty of funny moments (Holmes repeatedly paralyzing poor Gladstone) and witty dialogue (\\"No girl wants to marry a doctor who can't tell if a man's dead or not!\\").

B007BVMVDU|5.0|One of the best ever. Rather watch it than any movies in the theater. Keeps you hanging wanting more. Can't wait for the next one.
1423113454|5.0|once again am thankful for its fabulous condition and that it gets me closer tp completing my r.riordan collection of his older books thank you
B0015RFCZ0|5.0|The story line was captivating.  The way music was captured throughout the movie was wonderful.  The actors were great for their roles.  It was indeed a heart wrenching story.  Loved it.
B00785P2QC|3.0|The gameplay is very good but I fiend any game that uses energy to limit turns you can take to be very very annoying.
B000N2HBSO|5.0|This is a well researched history book that reads like a novel.  I recommend it to anyone who loves politics the way it should be played.

B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Kept you on the edge the whole time.  The twists were not expected.  A great trilogy!  Highly recommended.  Purchased the books on cd and made trips much shorter.
B0091QSNEE|5.0|My 2.5yr old loves this game.  He has some trouble with some of the tasks, but I like to think of the game as teaching him fine motor skills.  I also like this restaurant in particular because he has to clear the table and washes the dishes.  I enjoy hearing and watching him play because he narrates what he's doing.  I know, we gave in to technology, but with 2 kids we sometimes need a break.<br /><br />&lt;update 4/27/2014> Like some of their other apps, I find that sometimes the game freezes.  As you can imagine, my (now) 3 yr old does not like that.  We end up having to reboot our Kindle.  In spite of this, we still love the game, I just wish it wouldn't freeze up.  It doesn't happen frequently, maybe 1x or 2x a month.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|It is captivating, we usually wait for netflix or something cheaper but we could not with this one.<br /><br />Cons:  A little too gory at times.

B001GUXJQA|5.0|Excellent, just like all the others!  I love the Harry Bosch novels, cannot get enough of them.  Keep them coming!
B00AN0KBJC|5.0|This is a great show. We only discovered it this year and had to go back and watch from the beginning to get up to date. Love the scenery, period costumes, character depth and story line- it's a great and very entertaining show. Every show ends with a real shocker- I love it! Not for young kids though to much sex blood and violence!
0978545095|5.0|I visited the Chicago History Museum to view a showing of Vivian Maier's work and thoroughly enjoyed it and wanted to see more.  I ordered this book and was pleased with the display of her work, but was even more fascinated by the story of her life as described in the book.  This book is a great combination of her life and her work and is laid out nicely.
B007FC3AAI|5.0|Awesome :-D just loved it, couldn't stop watching it. A must watch for every one. Wish i had seen it on the big screen. Still can't decide between Jacob or Edward.
B009R659L8|4.0|As always the book moves along quickly.  Almost too quickly because before you know it it's over and it's like a friend moving away.  The twist was quite different.
B00BD2DRHW|3.0|Interesting if you can figure it out. After a certain point, I can not make it go further. I am still trying.
B00BR476TG|3.0|The movie began very well.  It held my curiosity until the very end..... at which time I was very disappointed.  It was sort of a 'non-ending'.  :)

0425263908|5.0|REVIEWED BY LIZ<br /><br />First, let me throw down the obvious: This. Book. Was. Hot. That was one of the things I loved about it. I've been reading more and more erotic romance, and trust me, this book delivers! On the flip side of that coin is that it may be a bit TOO much sex for some people. I have seen reviews stating that as a reason they didn't give the book five stars. So bear that in mind as you're deciding if you want to try this novel. There is a lot of sex. The hero and heroine are getting it on everywhere, all the time. You name it, they probably had sex there, LOL!<br /><br />I loved the heroine, Eva Tramell! She's been through SO much already in her life. I won't get into exactly what it was because it's better to find out about it by going on this journey with her. She is so tough and she doesn't take s*** from anyone. If you've read some of my other reviews, you should know that I love strong heroines and Eva is one of them. I also thought that, for the most part, she behaves like a normal, rational person, which make her very relatable. Her reactions to Gideon's wealth and controlling tendencies (to put it mildly) were the same reactions that you or I might have: incredulity first, followed by outrage or confusion later on.<br /><br />With any book like this, there are the inevitable comparisons to Fifty Shades of Grey. But it is with Eva's character that BARED TO YOU surpasses Fifty Shades. Eva is so much more mature than Ana. It felt to me that she was fully an adult and had the emotional capacity for someone like Gideon, whereas in other similar books, the heroine isn't.<br /><br />So Gideon Cross. What can I say about him that hasn't already been said about domineering heroes? Of course he is amazing looking! And like in other similar books, he has some mysterious, traumatic background. Actually, one thing that drove me nuts about this book is that we don't find out enough about his background. I wanted to dig down deep into Gideon's psyche and get ALL of his deep, dirty, dark secrets. I loved how the author made me feel about Gideon: I hated him and loved him at the same time. Is that even possible? I mean, at the beginning of the book, he doesn't even know Eva and he just straight up propositions her! Hello? What a tool, right? But the more you get to know him, the more you understand him and the more you like him. And yes, I know, I say that about a lot of books. But that's the way we get to know our heroes and heroines, right? What makes us love them are their weaknesses and strengths and quirks. If that's the case for you, then you'll LOVE Gideon because he has strengths, weaknesses, and quirks galore!<br /><br />I only had some very minor issues with certain portions of the book: I don't love borderline stalker behavior by the hero. Tracking someone's phone and/or credit card transactions is not sexy in any way, shape, or form, and it certainly is no way to show someone that you care or that you love them. It doesn't matter how many times I see this \\"character flaw\\" in the heroes of these mainstream-type erotic novels; I find it distasteful and I have a hard time seeing how anyone could find this sexy.<br /><br />Despite my issues with this, I thoroughly enjoyed reading BARED TO YOU! I've already read the next book in the Crossfire series and I can't wait until the third one comes out this summer.<br /><br />BOTTOM LINE:<br /><br />I loved this book! Had I read it in 2012, it would have been on MY favorites list! I would highly recommend this book to just about everyone. Some may call it a Fifty Shades of Grey knock-off, and maybe it is. But I feel that BARED TO YOU surpasses Fifty Shades by far. The writing, the pacing, the characters are all much better. If you liked or loved Fifty Shades, I think you would really enjoy BARED TO YOU.<br /><br />RATING: Ark secrets. I loved how the author made me feel about Gideon: I hated him and loved him at the same time. Is that even possible?

It doesn't matter how many times I see this \\"character flaw\\" in the heroes of these mainstream-type erotic novels; I find it distasteful and I have a hard time seeing how anyone could find this sexy.    Despite my issues with this, I thoroughly enjoyed reading BARED TO YOU! I've already read the next book in the Crossfire series and I can't wait until the third one comes out this summer.    BOTTOM LINE:    I loved this book! Had I read it in 2012, it would have been on MY favorites list! I would highly recommend this book to just about everyone. Some may call it a Fifty Shades of Grey knock-off, and maybe it is. But I feel that BARED TO YOU surpasses Fifty Shades by far. The writing, the pacing, the characters are all much better. If you liked or loved Fifty Shades, I think you would really enjoy BARED TO YOU.    RATING: A
B0090P98Z4|5.0|The game is so kool and fun I love this game so so so much  its also free download it please
B009HXO0D4|2.0|DVD was not playable on a US DVD player.  It was not evident that this extra content was video (rather than audio) and then not playable on a US DVD player.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Didn't think I could even get mu husband to watch this and now he is addicted.  Great entertainment and we love that it is a perk of Prime Membership.  Will probably be the single biggest reason I continue on Prime.
B005CRQ4GU|3.0|O loved the whole story but I hate how it ended so early 102 kids in my school hate this book cause of that .... So make it longer jeeeeeeez!
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Why such a long break?  You are killing us with the mystery of what happens now.  Oh by the way, I wouldn't put so much detail in the tag lines that come out when you do a Google Search on Downton Abbey.  I really didn't want to learn the ending before I even started to watch.
B003QSIM30|5.0|There are some ghosts in it, but my 2 year old seemed to not be bothered when we explained it...
B00881PTRC|5.0|What a fun game.  It is the same hangman that you played in grade school, but with attitude.<br /><br />I loved the graphics in the game.  The figures are drawn (and animated) in this deceptively simple looking style.  The drawings look like doodles, but they are very artistic and stylish doodles.  And the animated figures are all filled with personality.  I loved when I lost a game that the soon-to-be-dead stickman looked me in the eye and called me a loser by shaping the \\"L\\" symbol on his forehead.  What attitude.  Who would have thought an artist could make a stickman act so cheeky?<br /><br />From a skill level I thought the game challenging.  I was playing the \\"animal\\" themed games, and while some of the words were easy (crab, bear), some were very challenging (ungulates, gyrfalcon, cicada, artiodactyls).  And even if I knew the word I would deliberately miss some letter because if the stickman escaped the hangman at the last minute some very humorous spoofs were played out. LOL funny.<br /><br />The only minor nits I have about the app are:<br /><br />* Difficulty of looking up the definition.  I wish there was a dictionary built into the app so you didn't need an internet connection to lookup the word.  But I guess having an internal dictionary would make the app too bulky.<br /><br />* When you lose a game the letters that you missed are shown in yellow against a white background.  This is very difficult to see.<br /><br />* Some words were used more than once.<br /><br />* When you get a word correct, you don't get the option to look it up in the dictionary.<br /><br />So I guess you can tell that I really enjoyed playing this app.  It was fun but still challenging, and the clever and imaginative animations made an otherwise bland game humorous and appealing.  The artist(s) should be congratulated on his/her/their talent and creativity.
B00ADQPB50|4.0|Before the second season of this show started I knew I'd want to buy the DVD set.  The photos that were released before the primere just intrigued me SO MUCH.  I had very high hopes that mostly were met.  I do have a few problems: 1. jesus..the sex scenes every 4 minutes?  I don't mind sexual scenes, some shows do it right (six feet under) some don't.  This show DOESNT do it right, it's just not classy and seems thrown in for ratings.  2. Some of the story lines are no cohesive.  It seems like an idea would start off, or a story line, but not completely finished or thought out.  BUT overlooking these two minor things, I love the show.  It doesn't top season one, but Sister Jude's character (and Jessica Lange's acting) were enough to watch the show alone.  The series is definitely one that you can watch in two nights, because it is addicting in a really good way.  ALSO, I love the time period, while the first season was mostly focused on modern times, this series focuses on the 60s.  I'd watch this over and over again, and I probably will.
B0084AZXKK|3.0|I enjoyed this classic tale of  pirates and their adventures.  I was  totally  delighted by this book.  Silver's character was so interesting to me.
B002AF4Y9G|5.0|Even after all this time, this movie is still a favorite. Great set of DVDs, meanwhile, for a great price.
B0097RF1RY|5.0|who cares;  this badass piece of music had it, has it, and...<br />hell yes it does<br />and you get to flip it half way
0780619951|5.0|I was a little skeptical about this film just because all of the negativity it gets<br />but i decided to get it anyways cause i rather see for my self and i loved it.<br />yea its a bit strange but thats what makes this film really great. its very unique<br />Val and Brando are great. I feel if i go too into detail i will spoil it but what is also<br />great about this film is that you can relate to to real life, what power does to people.<br />just watch it.
B008JFLWLE|4.0|it is a little touching but other that it is awesome. I would make only a few changes the next up date.
B00BESM14U|5.0|my daughter read the book for school and loved it. so we rented the movie and she loved it. great purchase
B0076DCT2G|5.0|Nelson DeMille is an excellent author and story teller.  Very satisfying novel, especially if you are on a long airplane flight.
B000063KG6|4.0|Yep.  classic Alvin Lee.  He was the greatest blues rocker of all time.  A lot of emotion and sweat put into this.
B002ZTQVGQ|5.0|Bought this movie for my daughter and she cant stop watching it and i leanred how to make ponyo ramen which is really good and nice to have during cold weather.
B004UHL9EK|5.0|I use this for everything from cooking to time outs for my kids. Also works great with my 7 yr old. I turn tasks for him into races and he loves trying to Beat The Clock.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|Another great read from Grisham. He has this thought through from the very beginning not knowing what this guy is really up to.
B00BI5IXL4|5.0|I love this movie! Now, I don't have to pay money to see it as many times as I want.
B0058SNI94|5.0|These fit perfect. They are very comfortable and wide enough for my wide feet!!<br />Easy to get on and off.
B005S9EK5Y|5.0|We ordered the dvd in USA, because in Germany we will be able to get it not before june 27th.<br /><br />And so, we are able to see it already since weeks!
B005DJREGQ|5.0|Never heard of this movie show but happened to see it on Amazon prime.  Great characters.  Definitely not like my hs years but captures the world view dead on.
B00CDT41RY|5.0|This movie was one that you see over and over again.  Quentin Tarantino is known for making strange and unusual films, but they are films that you can't walk away until you see the end.  This is a western film with good acting and excellent special effects.  It is an &#34;R&#34; rated film but is has to be to show how life really was in the 19th century (very rough).  I rented this movie on Amazon and now I must purchase a copy to watch over and over again.  Again, you have to have some taste for Quentin's films in order appreciate this excellent movie.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|this game is pretty awseome. one of the best iv played.it is unique and different. and gets harder. this game is pretty sickk.
B00BFUUMO8|5.0|My. kids can't get enough of this game :) The graphics are great and the movement of the dinosaurs is actually realistic.
B00ANGSSWS|5.0|Very melodic and coherent. Great guitar, very well produced. In the End is an awesome song. Whole album is great!
B003KGBISY|5.0|It's a Criterion disc, so you already knew that about the transfer, and there's very little that I can say about the film itself that hasn't already been said. Any film buff should have this in his collection.
B00190OHD6|5.0|Great movie for couples and widows, have tissues on hand.  Funny, well done and with a great message in the end!
B0000549B0|5.0|This is a wonderful, sweet, heart warming comedy about a certain Elwood P. Dowd (magnificent James Stewart), who struggled with reality for 35 years and finally won over it...))) I loved every second of it and it moved me and cheered me up as few other films ever did.<br /><br />As you probably noticed on the cover of the DVD box, this film is basically about a very special relationship of a middle aged excentric man, Mr Dowd and a somehow shadowy figure, of more or less rabbity nature, called Harvey. As Harvey is very strict and choosy in his social interactions, Mr Dowd is the only one who can actually see Harvey... In fact Harvey is so discreet, that most people tend to disbelief that Harvey exists at all - and some even go as far as calling Mr Dowd just a tinsy weensy crazy...)))<br /><br />This film shows all the adventures of this improbable duo of best friends forever when the day comes for Mr Dowd's family to try to commit him in a psychiatric facility - which, thanks to the incredible charisma and gentle behaviour of Mr Dowd and the clever tricks played by the sneaky Harvey (assuming that he exists of course), will prove to be quite more difficult than anybody could possibly imagine...<br /><br />This film is a most wonderful thing, full of humour, filled with incredibly smart one liners and very intelligent dialog and all of its atmosphere is gentle, heart-warming and soothing. An absolute classic, to buy, see, keep and re-watch again. This is one of the DVds I am never letting go! Enjoy!
B007FEZQF8|5.0|I can't believe how much I actually liked this series.  I was really reluctant, thinking that it was just a glorified comic book, but I can happily say I was wrong.  The storyline was just as gripping as the TV show.  It was different but similar.  I love how the characters were originally written compared to what happened to them in the show.  I think I read all of them within a week.  Or maybe a week and a half.  If you watch the show, don't let the comic book style make you shy away from reading these.  They were unexpectedly great!
B005GFPZYK|5.0|This reads like hearing the story in person.  It's sad to think about Chris' untimely end.  Still a hero for America.
B00881PTRC|5.0|A very challenging game and great for learning words. It is also very cute and funny to watch the animations.
B0050DZN4K|5.0|Feedly has been such a great replacement for Google Reader! I wish I had found it earlier. The blogs I follow look so good, I can't wait to dig in every morning.
0393320928|5.0|Readers who enjoyed &#34;Surely You're Joking, Mr. Feynman&#34; will probably like this book also. I literally couldn't stop reading the section covering the Space Shuttle disaster. It takes an exceptional talent to make a discussion of the work of a government commission more interesting and exciting that the finest spy novel or detective story :)<br /><br />Not being a physicist, can anyone recommend further Feynman reading for me? (I might be able to understand something easy about physics, but the hard parts I just skip over :)
B008XBCJ34|5.0|tthis movie can be summed up in one word: Stunning<br />If you liked the regular version, you will LOVE the 3D.
B008QTVNUI|1.0|I do not watch R rated smut for a reason - it adds nothing to the presentation while demeaning the audience and the actors who contribute.  This society needs to learn to live with a bit of modesty once more.  Being prudish is one thing - but being totally without morals is another.  If you are looking for what has changed since the &#34;greatest generation&#34;, it is not so much in what they did in the bedroom as it is what they did in public that counts.  Public nudity (especially over the air waves) has no place in any society other than to diminish our values and plant seeds of destruction in our midst.
B00BRR66SA|4.0|Good CD. For only having 10 tracks, it is lengthy though. I like how there is a big band sound to some of the songs. The singles are good and catchy and may get stuck in your head for a while.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|A bit more unbelieveable but still excellent.  The journey through time of this very important element of our past is painfully evident, but always entertaining.  The inter-relationships of all of the characters continues to be a strength, despite that it seems a bit contrived at times.  One of the best casts ever assembled for any series I have seen.  Uniformly good, and faithful to the believeability of each of the parts they play.  One of the most uniquely entertaining series I have experienced.
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|Enjoyed the movie and the plot of the movie. It kept me interested and wanting to know what would happen next.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Well written, educational, and well cast.  This affords a peak into a discarded cast system that had its virtues - qualities that were equally as important to the success of a just society as they were destructive.  While it is (of necessity) a bit contrived, the weaknesses in the plot pale when compared to the quality of the presentation and the acting itself.
B0015DYIH2|5.0|This was the perfect ending to a fantastic series. My only suggestion: write a spin-off about Jacob and Renesmee so we can hear their story! Also, get a full copyright on your characters and ideas so we can stop seeing all these dumb parodys! They're pathetic and completely disgraceful! This is a well-planned, well-written series that is being chopped up and made into disgusting trash by others who have no talent of their own!
0062059963|5.0|The Plot:<br /><br />Here is a Secret, I hate Reality T.V shows, I can't stand them, for something that is supposed to be 'reality' looks very staged and unrealistic to me.  When I first read the selection, I bought it because everyone was talking about it. (good and Bad) what I do love is controversy.  I was extremely surprised when I started to read it at ten in the morning and found myself finishing it at five that night. I could not put it down.<br /><br />I was extremely excited when Harper Collins Publishing Australia sent me a copy of The Elite to read. This Book incorporates the one thing I really can't stand (reality T.V) and the one Thing I love (Dystopian Fiction) and brought them together beautifully.<br /><br />The Elite did not focus as much on the reality television side of the plot but more on the dystopian, the nefarious plotting of the southerners and northerners to bring down the Illea monarchy, and the desperation of the people.  I loved how America starts to uncover the history of Illea through a secret diary.<br /><br />America's Love Life:<br /><br />My guilty pleasure is I love Love Triangles, The drama and the fighting between the men for their one true love.  (they are occasionally drawn out too long which then loses my interest and annoys me.)  Keira however manages to change your heart along with America's one minute you are hoping that she picks Maxon, for the hope of her country and that he is so sweet. The next you are hoping for good old reliable Aspen who stands in the shadows, and pines after and protects her in secret, especially after Maxon makes some highly questionable decisions.  Usually I pick a book boyfriend early on in the series and stick to my opinion often losing when the protagonist chooses against my wishes.  But this is one series where my opinion keeps changing which is refreshing for me.<br /><br />The Competition:<br /><br />The Competition to become Princess is heating up with a lot more of the girls showing their true faces, (at least to the other girls).  I have in my head the girls I hate the most and the ones I would like to win if America chooses Aspen.  I tell you now I will be happy to see Celeste go, but then she sure does make a scene and I guess every story needs a bad guy.<br /><br />The Verdict:<br /><br />Get this book! it is Amazing, it is the perfect mix of dark dystopian and light reading I have read both Selection books in one sitting.true faces, (at least to the other girls).

B004478AS4|5.0|This is a masterpiece of African literature.  Excellent novel by an African writer! I am originally from the Democratic Republic of the Congo where French is spoken at school.  I grew up at the time where we needed to read literature by African writers.  I was not able to read Chinua Achebe.  Finally, I was able to read it!  Great book!  I wish it was translated in French so the students in the Congo can also read it.
B00BF11STU|5.0|The story everybody knows, the way they get there is part fascinating, part stomach turning. Torture, Physical, and Mental. can be a bit hard to watch. And the opening with the 9-11 sounds, runs a bit long, and can be hard to stomach. The trials and tribulations of how the CIA does intelligence, and the events that tie the story together, may or may not have been related to the hunt, yet still move the plot forward, and give the story an edge.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|This game Is a very good game that I would like to recomend to anyone who like awesome games that they like.
B005D9MUWY|4.0|The predictive text is sometimes eerily accurate at predicting entire sentences. It is definitely a smart keyboard that learns how you type. I've tried several keyboards for Android and this seems to be the best.
B002O2THRO|5.0|I love this book. I really enjoyed listening to the narration by Jake Gyllenhaal. He did a great job with the different characters. I would recommend this book to anybody that enjoys reading/listening to the old romance stories.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Very few young adult fiction leaves me as a reader with something to think about. I read the Last few pages in the early hours of the morning before school. And it left me with an awful sensation in my stomach, like a stone just sitting there. I couldn't stop thinking about it. Which is a big reason w huh u this novel as cores so big in my book.
B00000JPH6|5.0|My kids watched this movie when they were kids and loved it so I got it to see if the grandkids would like it and they do.
0767805712|5.0|This movie tells the tale of what this world is becoming, even now....with drug testing, credit checks, life insurance information.....Great Movie.....
B007ZGBZHE|4.0|There is a lot going on and as the series goes forward, it is getting a little too complicated.  Although it is interesting and basically a good read, it seems that there are never any answers, just more questions.  The police role in this book is very down-played and Pendergast has become the main focus with reality really being stretched to the limits.
B004QZ9PLU|4.0|Once I got to the second half I was hooked and couldn't put it down. However, I was able to figure out the ending which is why I only gave it four stars. I did like the characters a lot, and got attached to them.
B0094K1PW4|3.0|Rather &#34;hokie&#34; most of the time.  No really story line.  Kind like they wanted to make &#34;ET&#34; again but without much of an idea.  Not worth the time.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|With much the same thrill as when I read Scott Turow for the first time, this novel gets under the skin.  A super plot and great characters.  I don't often give 5 stars to a novel but this one deserves them.
B0094K1K42|2.0|No good character development; characters not likeable.  Silly premise.  Didn't ever develop into a worthwhile portrayal of anything.  Not young adults, juvenile!
B005LAIIKI|5.0|I was really surprised by this movie. I figured I would enjoy it, but it was a lot more darker than I expected it to be. Overall it is a revenge story. Jamie Fox and Christoph Waltz were fantastic. The soundtrack was perfect, as usual for a Tarantino film. There is one scene where Django and Hilda are running from the slave catchers that was one of my favorites. It just seemed so real. It was shot perfectly. The acting by all the actors was great. I must give props to DiCaprio for playing such a villain, I never would have thought he could play such a person. I think most fans of Tarantino will like this movie if not love it.
0007202075|4.0|Story is not exactly as the book that the students are reading a long with. Narrator is funny with his voices.
1582701709|3.0|I can't really give you a rating on this book. I purchased it for someone else to read and have not read it myself. Sorry.
6305212112|5.0|I had seen this film on television in the 90's and have now purchased it twice over the years (two of which have been here at Amazon =D ).  This is my third attempt, for sharing it with others it became lost, damaged and unsalvageable. So, I decided one more go.<br /><br />The extended version gives glimpses and insights into the heart of the story, and notes the physical and emotional cues derived by the actors. One particular instant in the behind the scenes footage regarding Jessica Tandy is remarkable.<br /><br />If you haven't visited Whistle Stop in a while, or want to have a great movie night, this is the one.
B00979CS50|4.0|The Psychedelic Pill is a good CD showing the wonderful talens of Neil Young, but for me, Neil Youngs Greatest Hits is the best.
B005DNBDXM|4.0|We've all seen this movie so I won't go into detail. Let's just say that's as far as an end of humanity type movie, this one is right near the top.<br />The effects are spectacular. The acting is - dare I say - great- and the plot is plausible. When things go wrong, they actually do go wrong.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Love this show. Its pretty bloody and fairly violent, but the characters are so well-developed and the story lines are captivating. Can't wait for season 4!
B003B02O3C|3.0|As a standalone Grisham book, &#34;The Rainmaker&#34; is entertaining; however, in general, Grisham's books have become very formulaic. They seem to have the same basic plot with different names for characters and locations. He does have a special talent in describing people and places very realistically. None of his recent books match &#34;A Time to Kill&#34; and &#34;The Firm&#34;.
B00BTYP6QE|5.0|This is a crackin smashin game, just as fun as the rest, but it's easier and quicker to fully complete.
B004LROUNG|3.0|I downloaded this book hoping to find something different out of Grisham, but I was disappointed. After one has read one of Grisham's books he/she has read them all. Very formulaic.
B005LAJ212|5.0|I could'nt wait for season 1, on tv.  I just went ahead and bought the set.  I'm loving it. Alot of plot and action.

B009JZTOG8|5.0|I watched session 1, but this session is getting way more interesting. I would totally recommend this series for older kids and adults. Love it!
B006VFLIYK|5.0|Once again David Baldacci captivates the reader from the beginning. Like his other books I had a hard time putting down the book for even 5 minutes and couldn't wait to continue reading. Robie is Baldacci's newest hero and certainly a very good one. Readers will not be disappointed!
B009FZHYKU|5.0|What a great series.  I am not into sci fi at all and I love this series.  What a great show!
B005DJREGQ|5.0|I really enjoyed this show.  I'm an old lady, 44, but still catch the humor.  I wouldn't want my teens watching it because of the sex, but find it funny as long as you don't take it too seriously.
B0041KBWM0|5.0|I had never read nor seen a production of Emma.<br />It is now one of my favorites.Beautiful adaptation.<br />Romola Garai perfectly captures the essence of a<br />Austen heroine.

B005Q1W10A|5.0|well done and riveting.  Can't wait to watch the next season.  Masterpiece classics are always so interesting and I learn so much
B009LH1Y1W|4.0|It's a great show, two brothers who hunt demons and fight with each other like two little girls fighting over a Barbie doll. Get over your personal problems, and get on with the show.
B00821OX98|5.0|I just started watching the show but so far I think it is great never a dull moment and the CGI is well done I would put it up there with son's of anarchy

B005MLOKXA|5.0|this show is great! My husband, a person typically a fan of real-life tv such as real crime shows, the History channel, and the news, even got caught up watching this show and is now addicted. I, a person that typically enjoy shows such as Desperate Housewives, forced him to sit and watch one episode of The Good Wife with me, and that's all she wrote; he was hooked!

B00633W614|5.0|Excellent read! Read this in two days. Then got the second one and finished it a quickly.  Can't wait for the third one.  Excellent story line that just flows along.  Loved this series.
B005HEFB6M|5.0|Great show its too bad they didn't make more seasons at first it too a little getting used to but I love it now.
B00783QXXU|5.0|Love the movie and this came in perfect condition. No dents or dings on the steelbook and no scratches on disc.
B009ZZDNT6|3.0|It's OK wouldn't pay for the full version tho. It should be free but that's just my opinion. But understand tho nothing is free in this country and everyone has to make at least a buck off anything and everything...

B004UJAOLM|5.0|This will keep you reading hour after hour. A great story and one you won't forget.  Besides, your English teacher would be proud.
0062059963|2.0|Just going to start out with: I was in love with the first book. I found it interesting and exciting, and I loved America, flaws and all.<br /><br />So safe to say I had been dying to read the follow up book- but it was incredibly uneventful and disappointing. Maybe I'm saying this just because the plot I had been hoping to be uncovered wasn't even touched upon really/further advanced. In the first I felt like the reader saw many good things and some bad things in all characters, but in this all I saw were the bad qualities of characters, main and supporting.<br /><br />I found America's indecisiveness and carelessness towards Maxon to be incredibly annoying after a while, maybe it would've been okay for the first half if she then had some epiphany but she didn't until literally the last page- and even then all I could think was 'okay you say you're gonna fight now but trrrrrusssst that all of page 5 into the book he's going to kiss or have dinner with another girl and you're going to get upset and this entire process will repeat'.<br /><br />Just ugh nothing memorable happened beyond the event with Marlee but otherwise it was 300something pages of blah.<br /><br />I think I just had very high expectations because of the first book, but this sequel I felt fell very flat.<br /><br />And now we all get to wait a whole other year to see some another plot happen that we were waiting last year to happen in this book. Fighting the urge to not shake my fist like an angry bitter old man and scream \\"I WAN MAH MOOOONAY BACK!'

B00BD2DRHW|2.0|The ones do not stay in place. Not fun just not interesting enough. I would not recommend this game to buy.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Episodes never disappoint.  The streaming was super frustrating with this particular view, kept &#34;loading&#34; multiple times at critical spots.  Can't figure out ow to complain to Amazon though!
B00BJS7LHC|5.0|Love the action and classic Tarantino comedic value!<br />Good one to add to the collection, if you haven't then your collection is lacking.......IJS MPO
B000000HHE|3.0|Arrived quickly, but quality of recording is low...and did not come with cellophane packaging. I wonder if it was new? but don't have time to return it.
B00AZRBLHO|5.0|Its fun and engaging. It is very seldom IT Operations end up as the heros and in this book it is described as if it is really possible.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I use this app all the time.  It is very handy.  I keep it with me to keep track of mileage and spending

B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This book will amaze you! Just when you think you know the whole story, you don't! Amazing story and it really makes you think about your own life and the people in it.
B0045HCJ9E|5.0|Cary Grant films are an absolute treasure and I have collected many of them. He is one of the best actors Hollywood ever had. I enjoy watching his films.
B000FC1KBG|2.0|Read this book while pregnant. Tried it out once baby arrived. Didn't really work for us. I like the part about understanding your child's personality but honestly, this book didn't help us too much.
B000FA675C|5.0|I love the book.  It is a real page turner and even though I read it when it first came out I love having a copy available on my Kindle.  I have read nearly all Dan Brown's books and have never been disappointed.
B005I4JG80|5.0|I really enjoyed this book while pregnant. It helped me decide ahead of time how and what to feed my son. I think the French really have child raising down pact!
B0001NBNAM|5.0|Growing up, my dad loved Connie Francis and was particularly charmed by the Italian songs she recorded. This is a great CD because it is 2 albums for the price of one CD. How can you go wrong?
B003LQ3YXU|5.0|Loving watching this on my kindle! Parceling it out to reward my self for accomplishing tasks.  On to the next season....!
0920668372|1.0|I got this book as a baby shower gift when I was pregnant for the first time with my son.  The lady who gave this to me said how much this book meant to her and said it was special and sentimental, so I read it when I got home that night, and I have to say to me as an expectant mother I could think of nothing less-encouraging.  It was far from special to me; I found it disturbing, and I put the book away after reading it once because I never wanted to read it again.<br /><br />Why? you may ask?  I see that there are a lot of reviewers who found this to be touching, and that is wonderful that it touched them in that way, but I am going to try to explain the point of view of those of us who were unsettled by it.  After reading criticism of some of the 1-star reviews, I wanted to clarify what it was for me, personally, that turned me off this book.<br /><br />First, I was pregnant, and I was greatly looking forward to enjoying not only the rest of my pregnancy but also my son's entire life.  I fully intend to love him, cuddle him, and hug him.  There was a macabre feel to this book that resonated like a Nervous Nellie as if to say, \\"don't forget--there will be bad things that happen. You're going to grow old.  You're going to miss him when he's older. Just think about getting old and your son wondering if you still love him.\\"  I like to live in the now and embrace the positive.  I know I will age, and I will deal with aging and adverse events as they happen, and I want my son to do the same.  I don't like to introduce the mindframe of worrying about \\"what if?\\"  If my child wants to ask me that, I will happily reassure him in an honest way.<br /><br />These days it feels like everyone wants to tell you, \\"you kid is going to grow up too fast,\\" and it is true, but just let me (and my son) enjoy every day without having that hanging over my head for crying out loud. I cherish and love every day, and I'd much prefer people focusing on making NOW great instead of ruminatingover the future.  I feel there are better ways for me to assure my son that I will always love him than with this book.<br /><br />Here's an excerpt from the book, \\"One day she called up her son and said, 'You'd better come see me because I'm very old and sick.' So her son came to see her. When he came in the door she tried to sing the song. She sang: I'll Love you forever, I'll like you for always... But she couldn't finish because she was too old and sick.\\"  For me, this isn't what I want to be reading to my child.  The rest of the book is pretty reasonable with the exception of the mom driving across town in the dark to sneak in when he is a grown adult to pick him up and sing to him.  I understand the sentiment, but it is still strange.<br /><br />For those who love the book, I'm glad they do, but it just isn't my cup of tea.
B005LAIHZY|5.0|This is such a fun movie about a mom & a daughter.  We love that the women are the heros in this movie & they are not witing for some prince to arrive.
B008JGSM6G|1.0|I did not like this. Was not challenging, was just busy work.  Might be good for younger age groups for eye hand coordination and mental exercise.
B001AR0D4A|4.0|My 12 year old daughter has been enjoying the Walking Dead, so I thought she might like The Mist, since several actors are in both. I've read the book and seen both the theatrical and director's cut and while I prefer the latter, I will be the first to admit the ending is brutal.<br /><br />So when I saw this two disc set I thought, \\"GREAT! I'll have both copies and I can let my daughter watch the color theatrical version!\\" Wrong, there is no theatrical version. It's all the original ending. So I'm watching it with my daughter and thinking, \\"this doesn't look like...BAM!\\" Oh dear. Sorry, honey.<br /><br />The movie loses one star for not even including a copy of the theatrical ending within the special features. I had to go on YouTube to show my daughter I really wasn't trying to traumatize her.
1452115567|5.0|This is a book that makes you smile, the photos are great and they are full of humour and dogness. Every single one of them is fun but not just that, the images are beautiful. And Theron's story is also inspiring: go, do what you love and do it often.
B0091REZMW|4.0|i really enjoy this game. i love hidden object games, they are my favorite and i like that i can play offline as well as online.
B003NX76BM|4.0|A nice twist the typical male romantic. No nonsense, brisk even and very likeable, certainly worked with heroine. A good read.play
B00AIQP9DE|3.0|There are cheaper games that are just as much fun as this game.  The game is fun, but not $5 fun.
B00280LYHS|5.0|I have read this book more then seven times but I just never ever get bored of it. Spoiler alert is ahead..... I love when annabeth talks to Luke and he tells Percy Jackson to give the knife and he does. Then at the end Percy and annabeth kiss underwater after they had gotten thrown in! Buy this book today!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B00BR4QNJ0|5.0|it is a fun game but it was slow to download and I sat there for about a hour. It took a long time. :(
B00003CXBK|5.0|There is truly nothing bad I can say about Princess Mononoke. It was the first Miyazaki film I ever saw and I fell in love with it. Everything about it is wonderful - the animation is absolutely gorgeous, the best I've seen. Disney looks like kiddy doodles in comparison. The story is explained well - the conflict pretty much begins immediately and the rest of the film involves main character Ashitaka trying to resolve the issues he faces. Plenty of action, nice fight scenes, nothing is rushed at all, and there are so many little details that you can easily miss, but that add to the film experience sort of subconsciously. The characters are all very well-developed; I don't quite understand why the antagonist has a British accent, but it manages to work.<br /><br />Possible spoilers here, but I also love that there is no happily ever after ending where Ashitaka and San get married and have a family and all that crap. I don't want to give too much away, but there is no everything turning out perfect. The film ends on a pretty good note, but not how you might expect. Which sometimes happens in real life too - stuff doesn't turn out picture perfect, but things will still work out in spite of some hardships.<br /><br />Even if you're not a huge animation fan, this is still a wonderful film and I'd recommend it for the movie library of pretty much anyone. Even for anime, these characters don't have the huge freaky wading-pool eyes that some anime series have - they look pretty normal. If you're not into anime, don't let the art style discourage you - it's a worthwhile viewing experience.
B000FBFN1U|5.0|I couldn't stop reading this book, there are a lot of important chapters and almost none uninteresting chapters. A lot of great wedding histories!
B00AB7HESI|1.0|no I don't like it I hate it it sucks<br />I like minecraft its better so don't get it. I don't like it sorry
B000FCKGPC|3.0|I didn't like the book, there are a lot of boring chapters, but it was worth the reading because the final is great!
030758836X|5.0|You can't put it down ... Lots of fun.  Gone Girl takes you on quite a ride!<br />Loved the book.
0061743526|5.0|I won't relate the plot of Harper Lee's To Kill a Mockingbird as it is so iconic almost everyone knows at least a little bit of what it's about. If you've only seen the Robert Mulligan film, I beg you to read the book too. The film does a great job condensing the book into two hours while still showing respect for the author but of course every book is better than the movie because if you're a writer you can fill it with as many incedental characters (Aunt Alexandria, Caroline Fisher, Francis Hancock and John Hale to name a few.) and episodical stories as you like. (Jem tearing up Mrs. Dubose's flower garden, Maudie's house burning down and the visit at Aunt Alexandria's house.)<br /><br />The dialogue is intelligent (where else did you learn the word 'chiffarobe') and crackling with wit. The narration provides a richly detailed description of all the characters and the 1930's Southern culture. Lee creates a wide variety of moods--suspenseful, sad, cheerful, lighthearted, solemn, etc.) never slipping into melodramatic, sentimental, soap-opera slush and makes you feel like you are living in the story.<br /><br />Five Stars.
B004IYISSK|5.0|I would Recommend this to all daughters and mothers, no matter what nationality! there are things that will make you laugh out loud and nod your head in agreement.  very very good book! I couldn't believe I was done with it! I wanted more . highly recommend
B004ZMWUCU|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this book. It was sad and very funny and heart wrenching.  I would recommend this  book to any one. I hope they make a movie from this book, it could be awesome.
B00B935SUY|3.0|Great movie, a bit self-aggrandizing at times for me though. I wish that it would have some footage of Kurt Cobane and more background on the owner's life.
B00942G4UA|3.0|Like-<br />getting more exposure to modern food processing and mass production of EVERYTHING we eat.<br /><br />Don't like-<br />getting more exposure to modern food processing and mass production of EVERYTHING we eat.
B009NG1Q96|5.0|The selection was so phenomenal, I couldn't have imagined a better sequel to follow it. Kiera Cass is an amazing writer and I simply can't contain my anticipation for the next one!!
B00441E2R8|4.0|I loved it. It's very chic. However, I couldn't use it that much cause my dog ate it the next day!!!!!
B0064MGU98|5.0|I have been powering through Season 1 and it is addicting! Very good writing, very good acting and a plot that is racing along. I think it is a very interesting concept of the wife who is dealing with her husband's sex scandal. This does not take up a big part of the show which is mostly a legal procedural, but it is what makes this show different from any other procedural.
B0092EE5HY|5.0|English is not my first language so...<br /><br />Funny, charming and smart. A true pleasure to read. If you liked &#34;a song of ice and fire&#34;, you will like this one too.
0316286850|3.0|I've given this three stars because there's really nothing wrong with it as a product. It's just not necessary in an era with so many youtube gurus. I basically didn't see anything but very well known techniques that I can find on youtube or make up tumblrs/blogs any day of the week. Weirdly enough, it's not interesting yet also not basic enough. It doesn't give step by steps on for e.g. which primer to use, best kinds of foundation brushes for different types of foundation, how to do a cut crease, how to do a winged eye. These are things I have googled over the past few weeks. There are some color combinations but most of them are neutral and there are more exciting things (broken record) on youtube.<br /><br />Bottom line: the pictures are pretty but I've barely looked at it since I bought it.
B0064MGU98|5.0|A series plot is woven through the situations of the individual programs and--despite serving as the mainspring of the program--seem to be heavy and awkward.  I watch the goodwife for the quality of the acting.
B00BD2DRHW|4.0|This game is great for anyone that likes bridges of any kind! Our 5 year old grandson LOVES bridges and has enjoyed this game though at times it is a little complicated for him and requires some adult help!
6304936362|5.0|I think this is the best WWII aerial combat movie I have ever seen besides Battle of Britain, and I like to know when will they have a official release of a Blu-ray. This movie deserve a release of a higher quality version, not to say a true WWII classic.
B0094K1WZE|3.0|I think that directors try to cram as much action into an adventure movie, without any clue of the plot. After half an hour, I forgot why this project was made.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|Thank you for sharing your thoughts and feelings about being a SEAL, a sniper, a loving husband and above all a warrior. This story is rich in everyday. I hold this book to be as thoughtful and inspiring as the Lone Survivor..  My sons best friend was a SEAL Chief lost in that rescue mission.<br />Your book made me feel patriotic and proud. It also brought ears to my eyes In places.<br />Thank you for your service and for sharing you thoughts and feelings.
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|The Alarm Clock is very efficient and helpful.  I used it often when I had to get up and do something..not too much these days since I am retired and lazy
B00BSBT8M6|5.0|We decided to rent this movie at the last moment.<br />It holds your attention and you become very involved with the story line.<br />It was great
B005K17RU0|4.0|Weather is accurate and easy to use. it is a helpful app that i would recommend to anyone who wants to know the weather forecast
B003UBTX6S|5.0|Loved this series. I didn't want the book to end. Also, it's an easy read - maybe 4 hours to read the whole thing.
B007ZGO7EM|4.0|this is a handy and accurate tool that works well on my Kindle HD.  It is easy to see and use.
B009UAO1ZG|5.0|now I know why Phillip Roth, wrote &#34;the Plot against America&#34; which I enjoyed as much.  The 40 's had Lindbergh, the 2000 have Limbaugh.  Both think they know more then anyone else
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|ndson who is much better at it than i am.  He is always outscoring my internet friends and we love it.
B003O86FMW|4.0|One always wonders how a second (or third) book in a series will compare......definitely worth the read! Seemed more fast paced and held my interest the entire time. Just glad I have the 3rd one on the kindle!
B004UID2LC|3.0|I actually don't use this app because I don't watch youTube very often.  I am too busy playing Scrabble and Word or reading selections from the Kindle lending library
B000I14UTS|3.0|I streamed it recently. Decent quality even though it's an old film. I first saw this when I was a kid, so my understanding is much different now. Joel Grey is the most entertaining of the characters.
B009VSW15Y|3.0|I don't use the camera as often as I would like because how many pictures of yourself can you take.  I upgraded and now I can't find the new photos on my device.
B007XKEY6Q|4.0|I hate that you can't just score things using the star system only.  I like this game. I wish people would respond faster to my drawing callenges
B005HSL626|3.0|this is a mindless game that is bright and colorful.  my five year old grandson introduced me to it and he plays more than I do
B007W1BLN0|4.0|I hate that you can't just score things using the star system only. smart kid who truely enjoyed his simplified life.
B00130UFY2|5.0|Always loved the \\"Bourne\\" films and just had to see this again. Way better than any Bond film. Thank you Matt Damon!
B000FBJFSC|4.0|It was good, but it was a hard book for me to read and enjoy.<br />There was so much poverty,it was hard for me to really enjoy reading it.  But I guess we have it in every country, to my sorrow.
B009UZLRJE|4.0|Until I bought this set. That's backward-ass logic for ya! Spent $75 for something I could watch free. But that's the way I roll, more dollars than sense I guess. I was told that it was funny and a few times I watched a little on tv, I had my doubts, but the show got better as the series went on.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|I can't say enough about this novel - it's one of those rare book that is perfectly written.  The characters each have their own, real voice and become real to the reader too.  Heart-rending; thought-provoking - can't forget it for days after you're done.  Every friend I recommended this book to felt the same way.  I didn't want it to end.
B009LMTDL0|3.0|This book could've been condensed to an article. If you've seen her TED talk then you won't get anything else from the book. I still believe in the concepts that were discussed.
B003ZJ70W4|4.0|Still enjoy every step of the relationship between the girls and especially Carrie and Big! The scenes with Samantha were hysterical!
B005LAIIJY|4.0|This movie wasn't half bad. I miss the old time westerns and the John Wayne movies, when you have seen all the GREAT ONES it's hard to find a NEW western?
B000FBJAEG|3.0|I like reading Baldacci's books because they are fast paced and do not require a lot of mental effort. This one pretty much fit that mold, but the character development was so-so and the dialogue between the characters was contrived. The plot was ok, but it seemed like the author got to a certain page count and then decided to end the story, so &#34;bang,&#34; everything comes to an end, no matter how improbable.
B000002GYR|5.0|I always enjoy Tom Waits  - this CD is exceptional - his style of artistry is uniquely wonderful and a joy to listen to
B005S9EKCW|5.0|I order this package and it is perfect !!<br />Me and my husband watched this movie at home because we missed at the theater.<br /><br />We love this movie and I gave the blu ray disc to my friends who has Blu-ray player.
B00BLCHYKU|5.0|The star of the show who plays Ragnar has the creepiest facial expressions and the most beautiful eyes.  It's a striking combination.  The historical accuracy and value are great as well.  I hope they have more episodes in season two.
B008XG1X18|4.0|I love it! Best way to find good ideas for my home and good recipies. I use it all the time.
B007EECSFA|5.0|This novel has all the elements of  a good read.  There is mystery, romance, and historical details.  I was totally engrossed throughout this book.
B000FA5TTW|5.0|The Lovely Bones is an amazing read. Sweet, painful, ethereal and beautifully written... It was better than expected by far.
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|What can I say? I'm an anglophile hooked on anything British--and Downton Abbey fits the bill to a &#34;T.&#34; Love it.
038532653X|4.0|Soon after Michael's family moves to a new home, his sister is born prematurely. While his parents are ferrying the newborn back and forth to the hospital, Michael deals with his stress by exploring their dilapidated garage. There, he finds a strange owl-like man. As Michael and the girl-next-door nurse the winged man back to health, he learns a lesson about love. This was a sweet little book. It was quite short, so there wasn't a lot of plot, but the characters and premise was quite adorable. This book would be appropriate for 7-9 year olds who enjoy reading magical realism.<br /><br />Almond did a fantastic job of narrating his own book. He has an engaging reading voice and had all the rhythms and intonations flowing well.
B00B5HQKNI|5.0|The franchise takes risks here. Without giving it all away, there are some real changes here and some scenes that clearly lift or at least take their inspiration from other franchises (Bourne, Dark Knight). Kudos to the producers for not standing still. Some of the storyline defies common sense but that's never been a real problem for thrillers (does North by Northwest make any sense?) and for a franchise that once featured a Lotus Esprit submarine, this is as real as it gets. This picks up on the grittier tone of Casino Royale and all to the good. Ralph Fiennes is a fine addition and Javier Bardem seems to be having a great time. More to the point, there are real people whom we care about at risk here and that makes for a fine story, well played.
B005O64VJQ|5.0|A Fish Called Wanda is a great movie!!! My purchase met all expectations. I received the movie within 2 days! I am very satisfied with the purchase of A Fish Called Wanda! Thank you.
B0079LJZG8|4.0|Webern did seven-minute symphonies. This is the film equivalent - a tone poem riffed off of John Le Carre's great novel. The mood is deeply embedded, the characters are vividly portrayed but everything is so truncated - I don't know how anyone would be able to follow the story at the speed this moves along. Maybe you don't have to - maybe you get the crucial bits anyway. I think it's wonderful but to anyone who enjoys it, I would recommend highly the six-hour BBC series with Alec Guinness, which fleshes out the detail this version has no time for.
B00AFEXRME|5.0|What can I say?  This man was born to become an ACTOR!!!  He gets into his characters so for real that it scares me sometimes, thinking that he won't come back to the same lovable Denzel!!!!!!  I am so proud of him!!!!  Especially the way he carries himself in the public eye.  We need real people like that.
B005HJWWW8|3.0|easy to charge, instructions are not very informative, it dose boost the sound level up to about 50 percent more, the equalizer is a nice addition but not needed for me, scotty i need more power!!!!!!
B0001HLVSC|5.0|Quite an excellent movie with one of my favorite actors, Russell Crowe. This movie shows how a good leader and a good friend ought to be.
1843106698|5.0|Thanks to anyone who deals with this on a daily basis. I love all of the help books that I can find on Aspergers.
1616550414|4.0|(Insert holding item above head music!) while i wish it would add more details from the older games and focus less on skyward sword, its still a great addition to any zelda fans collection!
B0081336FO|5.0|Finally a TV series that keeps me guessing even though i know the stories. Excellent adsptation of old stories to current generation. Love the partnership of sherlock and watson
B005MLOKXA|5.0|The characters are complicated and real.  I like the courtroom drama intermingled with the personal stories.  She becomes more &#34;real&#34; as the show progresses.
B006RXQ1L6|5.0|Great performances by people you don't expect to be in a musical.  Many parallels to the Jodi Aria trial.  Maybe this is where she got her story.
B00BQPEIT2|5.0|This is the ultimate game. Far surpasses the other temple runs. GRAPHICS are superior. This out does them all,a real challenge.
B00C5ZORES|5.0|Fall Out Boy gets better and better with every album they put out. This album is just amazing! I am so happy they are back! :)
B000FA675C|5.0|I really enjoy all of Dan Brown's novels! While some have been critical of his 'lecturing ' I like the explanation and attention to detail.
0393316041|5.0|Among the scientific giants of the 20th century, precious few were also great educators. In this collection, Richard Feynman gives us a rough sketch of his life, both personal and intellectual. Topics explored include the importance of making solid and coherent analogies for teaching and understanding, the nature of security in Los Alamos during the Manhattan Project, the loss of his wife to cancer and the importance of selecting the best materials for a course -- not just because the publisher took the professor out to lunch.<br /><br />Reading it, one gets a feel for the life and processes of an honest genius. I would recommend this book to any budding engineer or scientist (or any curious person (i.e. everybody)) as I would recommend Kurosawa's &#34;Something like an Autobiography&#34; to an aspiring filmmaker.
1616550414|4.0|I really Like this book, but it is not like I expected, come divide in 3 main sections, the first and more extend is the work art for every character in the franchise, the second and most important is the Hyrule History showing the chronology of all games, separate the games in eras and time lines and each one has a little amount of history (very few amount of history, that is why I give it 4 star) and some like comic work art, description of characters and a Zelda comic book based ins skyard sword.  So the history of hyrule is nor so extended like I expected, but it is fine 'cause told me some details about the Zelda's game that I never played before or I Played in the 80's and 90's for Nes and Gameboy and I don't remembered so good like I like.<br /><br />About the book itself, well like you can it is a hard cover, the cover had a nice golden details and each page is like a satin page, very durable, well I ordered 4 copies of this book 2 when was released and 2 more later, the first 2 come just in a box, but the second 2 come with an extra protection inside the book, may be is for the damage unit that some people received from amazon
B0063GORYU|5.0|great game... ads not too intrusive...once you get a high score decent enough it is challenging to beat that and that makes it a super app with superheroic powers that can withstand kryptonite
B0060FXBNM|4.0|Well, what do you expect when they build a story around action figures? Lots of action! CGI is superb. WARNING: The Autobots and Decepticons are MUCH bigger in the movies than at Walmart. And they bleed lubricant -- RED lubricant -- and spit yellow...well, I don't know what to call it. Anyway, they just fun.
B008UX2UIO|2.0|If you like slapstick humor, this is for you. Became predictable and boring.  But there is a book with a similar satarical character entitled: The Good Soldier Svejk by Jaroslav Hasek.  I believe it is everything 'Confederacy...'  wanted to be. It is really beautifully written and hilarious.
B00759FQOE|5.0|I love this album... &#34;Breathe,&#34; &#34;Firestarter,&#34; and &#34;Mindfields&#34; are totally kick ass (not to downplay the rest of this super rad album, by any means). The tracks on this album keep my heart pumping AND employ dynamic sound combinations that are nothing short of mind-blowing, from an artistic standpoint. These guys are veterans to this style of music and I'd be amazed if they put out anything that wasn't spectacular.
B00ATSBIIG|4.0|I like it ok. Just not as thrilled with it as I thought I would be.<br />My daughter loves it though.
B005DJREJS|5.0|Didn't think I would like this show this much! Has become my favorite, can't wait for more. Love the entire cast. and the story hold many truths.
B002VRZEYM|5.0|Although this film does not include the points of view of Big Aggie, as it were, the details are important. It is true that it will change how you see what you eat.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|All good things must come to an end. Definitely did not want anything to happen to Prim, sort of ruined the ending for me.
B00138F48G|5.0|Mark Lanegan is a great artist in my favorate genre--altrock.  He first came to my attention with his 2012 Mark Lanegan Band album, &#34;Blues Funeral.&#34;  Track 5 from this album, &#34;Riot In My House,&#34; is my top song from 2012.  &#34;Dust&#34; was my first foray into the Screaming Trees and became an instant favorite...plan to get 1992's &#34;Sweet Oblivion&#34; next.  Lanegan and the Screaming Trees fit in with the grunge movement of the early 1990s, but definitely created a unique niche within the movement.
B003IKMR0U|5.0|My 50's father who usually doesn't like the most recent moder games like Small World, Carcassone, Pandemic, actually likes this one.<br /><br />Because of it's simplicity and humour. Everyone simply likes it! And they don't have to fan of horror movies like I am.<br /><br />For fans of horror movies it's of course an added value but this is an already simpleness well taught out at it's best!
B00BHMETKC|4.0|Right up front, lets be clear... this one isn't for the kids.  The script is laced with profanity.  No rants, just plenty of salt.  Even if parents can get past that, the MPAA warnings about violence and disturbing images are very well-deserved here.  Beyond that, this is compelling, intriguing and at times confusing viewing for someone in their late 20's, who narrowly missed living through such a turbulent period in US-Iran relations.  These events are pulled from a long and tense history between the two countries, and undoubtedly form part of the knotty international relations challenge that my generation will inherit.  Particularly in the wake of Arab Spring, I found this movie insightful and eerily relevant.  It made me realize just how ignorant of that tangled history I--like many Americans, perhaps-- am.<br /><br />Affleck manages to deliver the central story with immediacy but without politicking, and always lets the drama of the events drive the story rather than trying to stage drama around the characters and risk clouding the bigger picture.  The hostage rescue attempt plays out in context, instead of subverting the gut-wrenching results of a clash of political wills to fit Hollywood cliches.  There are, nonetheless, moments of levity.  I can't comment on just how historically accurate the screenplay is, but it has certainly incited my curiosity to research these events for myself.  Despite the understated performance of the lead character (portrayed by a self-effacing Affleck), who is often \\"outplayed\\" by the actors/actresses he shares the screen with (purposefully, I believe), you are slowly drawn into sympathizing with him and rooting for his success...not only in an epic international rescue effort, but in the face of great personal struggles.  The filming, like the actor, is artful but subtle, never getting in the way of the momentum of the story.  Overall, the scenes feel gritty and real, not stylized.<br /><br />I didn't realize how invested in thefilm I was until the last ten minutes, when I spontaneously (and audibly) joined in the central characters' expression of emotion.  Not wanting to spoil the outcome for anyone, I'll leave it there.  But be forewarned, this is neither an easy nor a relaxing watch.  Reluctantly, I gave it 4 stars for that reason.  There is not quite enough character content and a little too much language to make this worthy of adding to my library.  That said, I think that it should be recommended viewing for youngish adults who, like me, missed the crisis but live with the fall-out.
B008476HBM|5.0|I so enjoyed reading the book after seeing all three, yes folks there are three movies.  Tho I must say the first one is nothing but a Hollywood glitz, glitter and no substance.  The other two moves followed the book rather well, the book was able to fill in a bit more.  Really good reading.
B000SEIK2S|5.0|I've been on a military science fiction rip for the past year or so. Got this book recommended after reading the Forever War.  I love the way John Scalzi develops his characters.  They feel real to me.  I quickly ripped through the original trilogy and I'm starting on the addional books now.
B005S9EKCW|5.0|Well scripted, excellent actors, and musical score made me forget all except living with the characters in the movie! Actually, I felt these characters were really living, rather than actors. I was living the moment locked in time with Hugh Jackman, Russell Crowe, Anne Hathaway,et al. Very impressive movie!
B009KS4XRO|4.0|This game is fun and addicting. But has some downsides too..  When played on my phone it tends to freeze up a lot.  Causing me to loose credits I paid for.  Also gets frustrating when others are winning a Bingo after one or two numbers are callled.  Makes it difficult to want to play when this happens.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|This application brings the weather to your finger tips.  Simple and very easy to use.  Log in and check out the weather wherever you are or are going.
B0011EP0S6|3.0|Had heard good things, but it was just ok.<br />Good music, story line was ok.  Just didn't enjoy it as much as I thought I would.  Ended somewhat abruptly.
B008XG1X18|5.0|Keep up with your own or your friends interests.  This is a fun and easy way to view the boards on the go or at home.
B005S9EK5Y|5.0|I've always loved this story and I was thrilled to get the movie.  And even though I knew the plot of the movie I enjoyed it immensely.<br />Thank you Amazon for all the wonderful products you put out.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|This mobile app will allow you to check your facebook account anywhere there is a Wi-Fi connection.  Makes it easy to keep in touch with friends & family.
B004SBS8LA|3.0|Man, I was looking forward to playing this game.  I like playing it but found out it was named right because I was getting upset for not being able to hit the marks.  It takes skill as will as making the mind work to solve the hits.
B00ARX2W24|5.0|This was everything that the other people said it would be...A nice album with a great sound....Cant get enough listening to this album..
B008I3RARW|1.0|This game was hard to figure out.  At least for me and my husband.  We both like racing and thought this game was for us but no way could we figure out a way to play it.  Other people may do fine with this game but not us.  Maybe it is our age!
B003O86FMW|5.0|It took me all of 30 seconds after finishing this book to purchase the next one and start reading it. Book 2 is definitely the best in the series.
B00881PTRC|5.0|This game is very funny. When i first saw the animations on the screen i had to click it.the font is annoying but other than that the game is perfect the way it is.
B0080MJYR0|2.0|Jan Fonda's first film. Just checking it out. So cheesy, it's hilarious to watch when compared to today's acting and special effects. Maybe worth a watch once if there's nothing else better to do...
B0091REZMW|5.0|No need to pay to play if you are willing to wait for energy to restore which is pretty fast.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|This has to be the most intense tv show ever created. Each new weeks episode keeps you on the edge of your seat with the walking dead, the characters and high budget this show just amazes you week after week after week. I can't wait til next season to see what bloody, zombie flesh eating fun will be in store.
B003VPWXRO|3.0|I really liked this book, but after awhile it became monotonous.<br />I really love Portia and I'm glad she was able to overcome this horrible disease, and really begin to love herself
B000QCQ8Y4|4.0|This is one of the only Reacher novels wherein I guessed the hidden bad guys and the end plot line.  And, the details of helicopter autorotation are exactly backward.  The helos need altitude for a pilot to respond to an engine out incident and react to do a proper autorotation.  The text says that it is better to be at low altitude.  No!  I'd rather be at 10k feet than at 1,000.  If I recall correctly the \\"death envelope\\" for a Bell 222 starts at 400 ft.  Below that, there is not enough time to react.  Even at 800 feet, it would take a really great pilot to react and land without damage.  I did a 206 from 1200 feet and never want to do that again!
B0091REZMW|5.0|This game is so far so good. Takes a bit of time to find the stuff. But than again, it IS a hidden objects game.
B000FC10WU|5.0|It's always fun to see what happens when an expert takes on a cliche; in its field.  Here an expert writer of mystery fiction took on one of its hoariest cliches and emerged triumphant.  Christie says in her foreword that she \\"treasured up the possibility of a suitable `Variation on a well-known Theme' \\" for \\"several\\" years before she worked out a plot and characters that satisfied her imagination: she wanted the library to be a conventional personal one and the body to be a sensational one, among other things.  Once she had those elements, she put Miss Marple to work at Gossington Hall in St. Mary Mead and the Majestic hotel in the seaside resort of Danemouth.  This was only the second Marple novel, but Christie has a sure hand and she produced a first class mystery novel that critic Robert Barnard labeled, \\"Bravura performance on a classic situation....\\"
B00A8SPNYW|5.0|This game can be rather addicting!  I enjoyed it and played it quite a bit.  Really good at keeping the kids occupied as well.
B009NG1Q96|4.0|I was happy getting the book after reading the first one. I needed to know what happened. Well I still don't know what will happen. That part I don't like but I'll wait for the next book.
B004SRPXWQ|5.0|My youngest daughter absolutely loves this!!!  Keeps her occupied for a really long time.  It's funny listening to this and the kids will certainly be entertained.
B008K6HN8I|5.0|just like windows explorer in PC. Highly recommend for everyone who wants to put files, music or movie in their kindle
B009IU6N5Y|5.0|I really liked this movie.  I liked it so much that not only did I download it to my Kindle but also bought the DVD.  It's entertaining to watch.
B005T87QCI|1.0|I got the game and also paid to unlock some extra robots. When my Kindle broke it was replaced and the robot add-ons will not transfer over. I spoke with Amazon and they said the robots have to be paid for again. What a rip-off.
B00C1BUYX4|5.0|An outstanding cast, superb writing, inspired directing,  incredible acting gives you a look into the politics of the Civil War.  By contrast, our  political situation seems absurdly civilized.  Except back then they actually accomplished something, perhaps passion is underrated.  Don't miss it.
B0034DGPEU|5.0|I didn't want to put this book down but I  also didn't want it to end!!!  I can't wait for the sequel
B00BWJARHO|2.0|I was looking forward to this movie. I am a fan of Tolkien. Loved what I saw good quality.acting was enjoyable, story followed the book fairly well. But what really mad me mad was the ending or not an ending. The hobbit did not end this way! Not even half. Why can they fat away selling an incomplete movie? For only part of a movie they should only charge a part of the price or stop calling it a movie and call it a series.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|My husband and I do not read the same books except Nicholas Sparks this book and his others have crossed the gender gap.  The books keep you entertained and wanting to read more even when you should be doing something else.
B000002KHH|5.0|I like my Ozzie old school. a truly crafted composition of an album. Some soft some hard but all thought out and with meaning unlike so many current efforts. It is a shame more of this music isn't played on the radio just because it is too long. Timeless classic rock lost to programming block concerns. Used to listen to this back when it came out on vinyl, I'm glad I picked it up on CD - I play it on my college station show (part of crossing off bucket list items). It is classified as heavy metal but I think it fits better in rock and roll because it has much more depth than the heavy metal of today. Everything is realtive what used to be shocking is now elevator and grocery store music. This holds up to all the changes.
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|Freaking eats everything and it was only 50,000 coins so play this game and get the most insane shark ever
B001BIMYXQ|5.0|Good collection of Eurythmics songs if you're looking for all their biggest hits. Can't say much more than that but Amazon wants me too.
B00846REIS|5.0|As I started this book it reminded me of Fifty Shades of Grey but as I read further it was not the same. I love the way Eva and Gideon share similar experiences and approach them in different ways but continue to grow closer. I would recommend this book to anyone who read the Grey series. Cannot wait to read the next one.
B008BDZOZY|5.0|If you like the inventive music of Annie Clark and the Little Creatures-era Talking Heads, you owe it to yourself to hear this album.  David Byrne's songwriting would be familiar to Talking Heads fans, but the horn arrangements along with the ethereal dimension St. Vincent contributes give the music its freshness.<br /><br />Clark and Byrne's collaboration is seamless, and the idiosyncrasies in their respective sounds beautifully mesh and complement one another.  It's rare to hear an album that manages to be fresh and yet this accessible and enjoyable.  It's great from start to finish, but I could listen to my five favorite tracks (\\"Who,\\" \\"Dinner for Two,\\" \\"Ice Age,\\" \\"Lazarus,\\" and \\"Outside of Space & Time\\") for hours.<br /><br />For me, the best album of 2012.
B007N6NGYG|4.0|This game is fun and presents enough of a challenge to not be boring. Some levels are simple and there are a couple of levels I still can't figure out.
B003LQ3YXU|5.0|I knew about the original Doctor Who series and had seen some episodes, all snowy and full of static, on some PBS or UHF station that I was able to pull in with a rabbit ears antenna in the early 80s.  By the time this latest version came around I no longer had cable.  I finally decided to order the first season on DVD and loved it.  I've read a lot of negative reviews of Christopher Eccleston's version of the Doctor but I loved him.  The episode The Empty Child really creeped me out, but in a good way.  When I joined Amazon Prime and was able to watch more seasons of the show it took awhile for me to adjust to David Tennant but after a few episodes I really liked him as well.  I'm still catching up on Amazon Prime and while I'm enjoying Matt Smith as the Doctor, I still much prefer Christopher Eccleston or David Tennant.
B0076DELIG|3.0|I have been reading Michael Connelly for twenty years. I have loved his books but this one was somewhat predictable, or typical if you like. Not as good as his earlier books.
B007SGM084|4.0|This book was very interesting. Some events were expected while others were a complete surprise. Not at all what I was expecting considering the media hoopla surrounding this book.
B000FC1RCI|1.0|I downloaded book and it crashed my Kindle!! I would like a refund for my order. Please respond to this because it's important i recieve my money back!
B00006ZXSK|5.0|This is a different spin on the classic \\" Cinderella\\" story.  It takes place during the Renassiance in France.  The film in and of itself is well made.  The costumes are appropriate for that period of time.  The acting is very good.  The plot is excellent.  The way it is told is fantastic.<br />The \\" Cinderella\\" character, Danielle, starts out as the original story did.  The girl is a child who gains a step-mother, Baroness Rodmilla de Ghent and 2 step-sisters, Marguerite and Jacqueline, and is doted on by her father.  Shortly thereafter Danielle's father dies.<br />About 10 years later Danielle is a servant in what was her own house.  Danielle is loved and looked after by the other servants.  Prince Henry, the crown prince of France, wants nothing to do with the responsibility that being king will bring him.  Henry runs away, again.  He runs into Danielle, who nearly beats him up for stealing one of her horses.  Once she finds out who he is he pays her to keep quiet.  Danielle uses the money to buy back one of the servants that Rodmilla sold to pay her taxes.  Danielle pretends to be an aristrocrat to do this.  She also runs into Henry who doesn't recognize her.  Instead of the fawning that he is used to getting by the ladies at court what he gets from Danielle is something of a lecture.  He also has to chase her which is something new for him as well.  Danielle gives her mother's name, Nicole, as her own.  Then she leaves.<br />Henry and Danielle run into each other a few more times.  During all of this Danielle befriends Leonardo Da Vinci, the artist in residence at the French court.  Leonardo has some inkling that Danielle is not what she pretends to be, but he says nothing.  Meanwhile Marguerite, the prettiest and most spoiled of Rodmilla's daughters, is relentlessly pursuing Henry.  Both she and Rodmilla are convinced that because Marguerite is so pretty that she will marry Henry and be the next queen of France.  Jacqueline is the only one in Rodmilla's familywho is remotely kind to Danielle and that is probably because Rodmilla treats Jacqueline as she were the bad seed of the family because Jacqueline is a tad overweight and is not nearly as pretty as Marguerite.<br />Danielle and Henry get to know one another.  He is entranced by her passion for life.  At one point Danielle even saves Henry's life.  Danielle discovers that while Henry may be an aristocrat he looks at being a prince as a burden.  He is also neither truly spoiled or arrogant.  Henry turns out to be rather kind and he rarely shows who he truly is to anyone.<br />Once Rodmilla finds out that Henry likes Danielle she tries to sabotage the relationship.  Danielle starts to stand up to Rodmilla and Marguerite.  Jacqueline admires her for that and even cares for Danielle's wounds that Rodmilla gives her.  On the night of a royal ball when Henry is supposed announce who he will marry Rodmilla locks Danielle up and her friend Gustav gets Leonardo who frees Danielle.  Leonardo doesn't care once he finds out who Danielle really.  Danielle shows up at the ball and Rodmilla sabotages the whole thing.  The next day Rodmilla sells Danielle to a man she hates.  Ultimately Danielle frees herself.  Henry realizes what a big mistake that he has made and that he doesn't care about Danielle's station, he cares about her.  In a scheme obviously devised beforehand both Rodmilla and Marguerite get their comeuppence.  Henry and Danielle end up together.  Jacqueline ends up with the captain of Henry's guard.<br />On the whole this is a great film.  While is not suitable for small children, slightly older ones, teenagers, and adults will probably enjoy it.
B000FA675C|4.0|Even after seeing the movie it was a very good read.  Wish I spoke French to understand all the French terms better.
0062200909|5.0|Perfect condition.  Beautiful book! Full of detailed full page pictures and drawings. Great gift for any fan of the series!
0765325950|4.0|I started reading this series back in the 90's.  I agree with most of the thoughts on the series in that the first few books were great.  As we approached the middle of the series, things began to drag (but I still read them all when they came out).  Whether Jordan picked up on this or if the introduction of Sanderson helped (or a combination)I'm not sure but the final books have been great.<br />In regards to Memory of Light, I was very please with the book.  It was fast moving and closed all of the major sub-plots about as well as I could expect.  That's saying a lot considering the multitude of characters that needed to be addressed.  While some of the character endings seemed rushed, I think Sanderson did better than I expected.<br />Ironically, after countless volumes and pages, I did feel a bit of regret at the ending.  With all of the character detail, I can't believe that I'm not going to find out what happens to Mat, Perrin and Rand in the future.  I'll especially miss Mat's wit!
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I really enjoyed this book.  I was hesitant that it would be &#34;sad&#34; the entire way through, but I loved its perspective.  I believe that this book takes a real life approach and is most definately not too sappy.
B003JUGQ38|5.0|As an avid Doctor who Fan, this season with David Tenant didn't disappoint. It is well scripted, well acted, and I enjoyed it immensely. The BBC has attempted to treat its Doctor Who fans and again has succeeded. I would love to see more of the old original Doctor Who, shows on Amazon, for Prime Members.
B004ZN9RWK|1.0|I was surprised it is in a cheap thin slip cover rather than a CD plastic case and as I listened to it it is riddled with dead spots were the music just goes dead and then comes back. I love Pink Floyd and was really excited to get another copy of this CD after my other one was lost, but really disappointed with the quality of this CD.
B00B6LS9HS|4.0|I was very surprised when listening to this...it took me straight back to the 80's.  Good stadium type rock to listen to.  Guitar work is decent but don't listen to the lyrics - they are pretty bad.  If you like 80's rock it is worth a preview. Seems it's not for everyone though as my wife hates it, and others who had there teen age years in the 80's like I did chuckle at it like it's a so so gag gift.<br />Personally - I think it's pretty good, especially to listen to if you're working or just need something different.
B009JZWO3I|5.0|great series! fine acting and excellent plot and dialogue makes this a superb adult drama set in a legal scenario.
B00BIVN82M|2.0|We were really looking forward to this CD, we have all of his cd's and dvd's and love them all, this was boring , as my Husband said it was like hearing the same song over and over , missed the drums and horns,  the excitment
B00007LTIG|5.0|i bought this for my husband as he had been looking for a very specific song and it was on this album (cd).  He was surprised and very happy with the product

B0050DIWFC|5.0|I loved this book -- moved along at a nice pace -- chilling, scary, believable -- and the surprise ending was a gift to the reader.

B008JGSM6G|5.0|Fun and challenging and awesome sound effects, plus my little ones love to watch and play along with us! Instantly soothes them when it is bed time!
B0084YAU86|5.0|To say this show is great is an understatement. Everyone from the beyond brilliant cast to the incredible writers deserve to take a bow. I was hooked in about 5 minutes into the first episode, and now I can't imagine my life without watching this show. From hilarious anecdotes to tense heart wrenching moments, this show keeps you on edge. Benedict Cumberbatch and Martin Freeman are gods amongst men. Their performances are too great for words, and if I could I would thank them for their brilliant work. The season finales are full of suspense and emotion and it keeps you on edge until the very end. I can't wait for season 3 to start.
B0036BK6MW|5.0|This is what Hollywood is supposed to do.  Fun and beautiful.  Amazing movie with so many lessons about life and the pursuit of happiness.
B004X2M3N8|5.0|Best show ever! I watch it everyday now!!!!!who knew that doctor who would be cool! I thought at frist it was stupid but now it AMAZING
B004GHNIRK|4.0|There were quite a few errors in the ebook.  Several times instead of &#34;die&#34;, &#34;the was used.  A bit confusing at times.  I loved the translation of this text.
B001DM1VXE|2.0|I found this to be unimaginative and over acted, predictable ending with a twisted route to find the conclusion, not very entertaining.
B00785P2QC|4.0|If tycoon is your thing you'll love this...it keeps you entertained...and on top of that, its free.I recommend this download.its one of g5's better apps
B008602KQI|5.0|I thought that this story while taking some license from the &#34;Running Man&#34; with several twists was very entertaining and has set itself up for a sequel where the Disricts rebel once again, I'll be interested to see such a movie if it is in fact made.
B002APU580|5.0|Can't get the movie out of my head after I watched it. The music was wonderful as well. Bought the soundtrack.
B009RH9FR6|5.0|This is an excellent case for the Kindle Fire, offering an attractive but useful cover. The sleek leather feel only adds to its attraction. The Kindle fits snugly into the case. The rotation is solid and proved helpful when one wants to charge the Kindle. The case allows the Kindle to be stood up for easy reading. At first glance, the case does not appear to support the Kindle when it is standing but, surprisingly, it holds fairly well. I've come across five or so Kindle Fire cases and this is easily the best--and, with its professional covering, one of the more attractive.
B005LAIIKI|5.0|It's rare that a 165-minute flick never makes me look at my watch, but I was with this one all the way through. It starts strong and then shifts into an even better gear when DiCaprio shows up. His excellent performance makes this one, but Foxx and especially Wertz are equally splendid. The compositions are uniformly gorgeous, as is the production design. The script is almost flawless, and Tarantino certainly deserved the Oscar for it.<br /><br />There's not a bad bit of acting in this, nor many wasted moments. My only niggle is the typically overblown QT slow-mo blood-spattering grindhouse shootout at the end. If it had been a little less gleeful in its bloodlust this might be one of the best Westerns ever made. Yet it gets way over the top and out of hand by the finale and kind of brings the film back to Hollywood, unfortunately. But the good far outweighs the bad here, and as one of the most honest cinematic depictions of slavery's horrors, and American capitalism's conveniently forgotten origins, it earns its place as one of the best American movies of the past few years.<br /><br />The blu-ray is a perfect transfer, and looks great. The superb score sounds very crisp and warm in surround, and the extras have three brief docs that are quite good, especially the one on the production designer who died during the shoot. However, the extras feature the cast and crew talking over and over about how totally awesomely super-duper wonderful QT is, as with most of his dvd/bd extras. The man does not lack in ego, to be sure. But then again, he backs it up with the goods here, so fair dinkum.<br /><br />Let's hope Quentin sticks with this kind of character exploration laced with black humor, as he does it very well indeed.
B009NG1Q96|5.0|Another great read. There are a few tense parts that made me uncomfortable but you need them to have the relief of understanding later. Now I am ready to see how America and Her Prince can overcome everything in their way and make their country great.
B009X01GJ2|5.0|needed a case for the slippery Kindle Fire that could be used either direction. This works perfectly and easy to find in the purple color.
B00881PTRC|5.0|This brings back fun for hangman. I played all four themes and flower power is my favorite. There are several categories to choose between. Even different languages to choose between. So far I have learned a few things I didn't know even existed. I like that if you lose you can look up the definition of the word, but wish that was an option even if you get the word right. There was a few a got right by guessing but never heard of the word before. I love the music, but the sounds I turned off because they got annoying after a few minutes. The one thing I would like to see added is a difficulty setting. Easy, medium, or hard. All in all, a great game I will keep on my tablet (nexus 7) for awhile.
1616550414|5.0|Although more of this book is dedicated to Skyward Sword than I would have liked - it is still a very beautiful (and thick) piece of work that has loads of art, descriptions, concepts and developer input.  It's an easy recommend.
B003EGBASI|5.0|I got this to replace a book that I burrowed from my sister. I love the story line. Thank you.
B00AN0KBJC|4.0|this show kinda of feels like the tv version of lord of the rings with boobs, and lots of em.  I'd give it a 5 star rating if the stories would move just a little faster, still a bad ass show though, check it out!
B00899F0G8|5.0|sometimes a girl just wants to turn her brain off and watch something completely far fetched... this accomplishes that while still making you want to keep watching to find out what will happen next.
B00BSBT8M6|5.0|this movie started kind of slow just like slumdog millionaire but give it a chance, this was a GREAT movie!
B007FEFLTO|4.0|To me, more of a page turner than the first of the series. Probably due to the time period being within my life experience.
B00B69UQJY|5.0|Does is get any better than Depeche Mode.  I've been listening to these guys for 30 years and still love them.
B0052RDHTM|4.0|Though not a page turner. Interesting novel based upon history. Too many charactors, The reader should expect this when starting a Follett nover though.
B003B96AOW|5.0|Cool figure bought it for my son he loves it. Bought one myself a year or two ago for display cant complain diamond is very detailed cool company
B009YP9L7U|5.0|For a free book I was sure I was going to get what I paid for but to my surprise I didn't want to put the book down. I am happy to say it was something I needed to read at the perfect time in my life.
B002YCVX5S|5.0|Loved it the first time I watched it and I can't watch every movie twice and enjoy it, but this one I did.
1401201911|5.0|The story is amazing and worth a read. Hopefully they'll do an animated movie from this source it was that good. Marvel stories are good for fun and entertainment. DC stories are more character driven and engaging. This is one of this stories but well worth reading you'll enjoy it all the way through.
B009GJBBDQ|5.0|I am however, a bond fan but the movie is great. Fast phased, action movie. I had watched it many time before  and still can watch it.
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|I thought they did a great job stayinh close to the original material but of course the book is better!
B001NLKT60|5.0|This series of books is well worth reading if you enjoy intrigue, suspense, the hunt. It keeps you guessing right up to the ending. It was full of surprises. Can't wait to read number 3.
B00CAJMGDI|5.0|Seriously, if you like dance music, or violins, give Lindsey a listen. She's taking the world by storm, and I love it!
B005HSL626|4.0|fun little game to play while waiting and killing time--quick enough to not get too wrapped up in it--great colors and interesting fruit tidbits too--people like looking over my shoulder --I think the colors and splats attract them
0062059963|2.0|I loved \\"The Selection\\".  \\"The Elite\\", however fell very, very flat.<br />****SPOILER ALERT*****<br />The entire book for me:  I love Aspen.  I love Maxon.  No, wait!  I love Aspen.  Only He will fill my heart.  Wait!  I love Maxon and want to be with him.  No, it's Aspen.<br />Seriously.... the only question left for me in this book was which fickle flip flop America would be on when the book actually ended.
B008M87GJK|4.0|I like the world coverage and different viewpoints that the BBC news provides.  I have had no problems installing or using it.
B00881PTRC|4.0|This app is exactly what I've been looking for in a hangman game.  Just hangman with an awesome doodle guy as well as 3 other themes for free.  The only suggestion I have is more themes and the doodle guy should cheer and such when you do good and if you win he should do a little dance or something.
B00BHHIWQO|4.0|This game is highly addictive. Once you start playing you'll be hard pressed to stop. It does freeze up, but easy to reset. Love playing on my kindle.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Very good storyline and actors.  I like being able to watch all the episodes back to back.  I highly recommend it!
B007L3BMGA|2.0|I got about a quarter through this book, before stopping...I didn't like the writing much, and had that been better, I probably would have finished the book.
B0052RDHTM|4.0|This was a great history lesson.  Humanizes the causes and effects of war on all sides - no country has the one answer, good and evil on both sides.  Very interesting about the rise of Bolshevism in Russia and the Labour Party in England. Great read
B0079TQHDO|4.0|HE IS A MASTER STORYTELLER, and gets you engrossed in the story, then it ends, and you have to buy the next book.

B0044DEAUA|5.0|This product works great.  I have enjoyed mine so much that I have been giving friends and relatives one to use.  The price was reasonable and the product works every time I use it. Fast service and easy to use!!
B004I1WIWU|5.0|I love this album, the quality is great and listening to it on vinyl makes it even better! Glad I purchased.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I thought this was the best of the three because it brought together what Christian Grey was all about.  Excellent triology.
B000QCS8TW|5.0|I wish I had read this wonderful tale before.  On to the next.  I should probably wait and get some things done because I could not put this one down.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Excellent writing and details about Grey's character and what made him do what he does.  Very intriguing.  Would reccommend to all adults.
1454901276|5.0|I love the book and I'm dying to start the next book in the series. IF IT EVER BECOMES AVAILABLE !
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Met all my expectations.  Very fresh story and given a different approach than most romantic novels.  Would reccommend it to all adults who are interested
B007N5YIUS|5.0|Just a fun game to help relax and unwind, I recently had to spend several hours int he hospital and it was a great stress reliever to keep my mind  busy while waiting
B00002DE4E|5.0|What can you say about this CD, I don't think it received enough exposure, all great tracks, very deep and thought provoking.
0880796863|5.0|Sorry to say I didn't really get into them yet but I can see they are everything I expected. Wish the booklet was a little bigger though.
B00B69UQEO|5.0|Depeche Mode is one of the most innovative bands ever if not the most, their music is eclectic, Synth pop, rock, melodic, Bluesie, you name it, I have all their albums except 2 which I will be getting soon, DM is pretty much all I listen too. This album proves they are the best of all time, I can listen to their music into my later years and not look ridiculous, their music is deep, mature, energetic and beyond cool, they are popular yet not commercial, I love every song on this album.<br /><br />Love the packaging especially since I store the CDs in their original case, DMs are an audible piece of  art.
B0055QYKQO|4.0|Not too hard to install if u dont have a liquid cooled pc like i do, but it comes with the latest revised bios. Everything u could want u ur bios for oc'ing and such. Only negative thing i have to say is it dosent come with LAN [or internet} drivers installed so dont throw away your disk so you can install that driver.
B00445JSWS|4.0|I would have given it a  but it's missing the DM impact and was not too impressed with the packaging, too fragile, they need to invest on their packaging as they did with their newly released Delta Machine
0385349947|4.0|It bought this book to get away from business texts and professional journals. It's good hotel nightstand reading when you are away from home and missing family, friends, parties, and feeling beaten up about being a good woman executive. Take it out and flip through it on days when you've been attacked with professional jealousy, harshly criticized for being direct, and speaking your mind, or having to call someone down for inappropriate behavior or crossing a boundary.<br /><br />Ask your significant other to read it too, when they get whiney about your work, travel and business commitments. A good tool for the reality checks that a woman executive's life isn't all long lunches, power breakfasts, and gala dinners, or room service and spa visits or Carrie Bradshaw shoe shopping extravaganzas.
B000005JAX|5.0|Love Martin Gore, he is master song writer, I keep discovering new music from them all the time, this CD is awesome! Especially the first track.
0061537969|1.0|I loved the start of this book. I thought the dogs-eye view of the world was refreshing and insightful. And then the story quickly turns sad, then morose, then unsavory, then so unbelievably down that I literally flipped through the last dozen chapters or so just to find the ending, which should have stopped one chapter earlier. A sweet story about a dog and his family turns to cancer, death, alleged statutory rape... ugh. I don't understand how so many people love this massive downer of a book that tries to pull out of it's emotional crash dive in the final pages.
B007HACDLK|5.0|All of Vince Flynn's books are good, gripping and satisfy the reason I read books. I am glad he is writing.
B005S9EK5Y|5.0|enjoyed the movie but it wasn't one of my favorites of this years movies.  So glad I could watch it at my own time
B009YP9L7U|5.0|I absolutely loved this book. This story renews your belief that true love is possible and if you really believe than anything can happen. I also think that if you are looking for a feel good story than you need to read this book.
B00AHTYI5M|5.0|I saw this in the theater and was awed emotionally  I had to order it to watch it again and see what I had missed the first time through.  It was wonderful
B005K17RU0|5.0|Very easy to use app. It has graphs. I love graphs. I also like how it shows the current weather and temperature in the pull down menu.
B005LAIIHG|5.0|this was a fantastic movie and after watching it on a dvd I bought the book to read what I had missed on film. They did such a good job with it.  A friend of mine and I watched it together and commented on the entire story and how involved it was and what our thoughts were.  Very well done!
B005GY0Y8S|3.0|There were some unintended comedy lines in here- like the guy who was making a &#34;roue&#34; instead of a roux, etc.  Stirring a roue conjured up a cute picture for me.  I didn't find it very compelling in general.
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|what a great series this has been and I am so glad that people are able to order from you!  This was the only way that I was able to watch this series but hope to be able to catch season 4 when it starts.  Thank you.
B007B5EDEG|4.0|Trying to read this epic, while watching the different series on tv.  Interesting and at times shocking, warm, realistic-like, based in history.  keeping my spare time occupied
0385349947|5.0|As a  young woman entering the business world, I found this book incredibly helpful and relatable. I currently have no marriage prospects, but I already have a fear that one day I will have to choose between family and career. Sandberg  made realize that not only am I not alone with this concern, but it is also possible to do both. Her insight, advice, and fun stories kept me up long into the night; I couldn't put the book down. I am so glad I read this book at such a young age. I highly recommend this book to driven females and males of all ages.<br /><br />I also want to comment on a few of the negative posts.  Yes, Sandberg went to Harvard and was the daughter of a doctor. I don't see<br />how this is relevant. She still had the grades to get into Harvard and had the drive and skills to become successful. Not many people<br />will have the same opportunities as she did but every one can relate to the concrete advice she gives you on how to succeed. The fact<br />that people are talking about this issue at all is a gender bias. There are plenty of men leaders who were born with a silver spoon but the comments on that subject are rare. Secondly, Sandberg does not make any negative comments about mothers who stay at home. She mentions many, many times that she respects those women and realizes an executive position isn't everyone's dream. This book is for women who want to succeed and want to balance work and family life. This doesn't mean we are better or worse than the stay at home  moms; it simply means we are different. If you do not have the drive to succeed in the business/work/volunteer world, this book is simply not for you.
B00571F26Y|4.0|interesting facts and information about wheat - after reading this book, I have considerably reduce to almost eliminated wheat from my diet and it has had definite good health impacts
B006LSZECO|5.0|I just hope the author writes a sequel to this book because I want more!!!!! I love a book that gets you from the beginning and this was it :-)
1935597760|5.0|Just finished reading this on my Kindle Fire. What a terrific story. You can both laugh and cry within a few pages. I highlighted the heck out of this book; especially the lines of neighbor Rose McFadden. I've been recommending this to family and friends.
B006MPKDUE|5.0|Connelly gets better and better each time. Last coyote is full of twists and turns. You definitely don't see them coming. Harry Bosch not only endears himself to the reader but even to the characters within the book. He is mean and rough but you can't help but love him. Another great read.
B002M9WW30|1.0|Discs 1-3 work fine, but 4-6 will not even load.  Make sure to check your discs before the month return policy is over.
B006LSZECO|5.0|This was and is one of the best books I have read lately. All kinds if cuckoo crazy and suspense. I loved it!!
006220629X|4.0|At last, another installment of the Shadow of the Wind series! I do not want to say trilogy because after I finished this book I felt that there is room for more novels in the series. I was slightly disappointed to see that this novel was only 294 pages where his other books were lengthier. Carlos Ruiz Zafon is a master storyteller no matter how many pages are in the book. When reading a book that belongs to a series, sometimes you are able to read the series in any order you choose, this is not one of them. If you have not read Shadow of the Wind or Angel's Game and are considering reading Prisoner of Heaven, you should stop and read the books in order. If you are like me and read the other two books a couple of years ago, you may want to go back and read them again. These books are definitely worth another round. Prisoner of Heaven contains the small cast of characters found in the other two books. These characters are vibrant, alive, and jump off the page. Some characters are inherently evil while others are good, but the best characters contain several shades of grey between good and evil.<br /><br />Prisoner of Heaven takes place in Barcelona in 1957 where Sempere and Sons Bookshop is starting to fall on hard times during the holiday season. A mysterious man visits Daniel Sempere in the bookstore and is searching for Fermin Romero Torres (another employee of the bookstore). When Daniel mentions the visit to Fermin, Fermin has no choice but to reveal his mysterious past to Daniel. About half of the book is a flashback of Fermin's past when he was imprisoned in the tower with the author David Martin from Angel's Game. Fermin is also about to marry his sweetheart, Bernarda, but has to get a few things in order first. My favorite feature of these stories is the dialogue. I am glad I read this on my kindle so that I may go back and refer to the highlights, but the hardcover book is so beautiful that I may just have to get a copy of that too.
B00785P2QC|3.0|I enjoyed this game. I hope it stays this good and I don't get bored with it like most other games I happen to play
0062059963|3.0|Let me defend my three star review by acknowledging how much I love this series, these characters, and the realistic ﻿portrayal of a seventeen year old girl faced with so much on her shoulders. I adore America, Maxon and Aspen and I admire the love triangle Kiera Cass has constructed that leaves me flabbergasted over who America should end up with as much as the next reader. But this installment (while I read it all within a six hour period), fell a little flat, giving me little to defend in terms of an overall good story and made me feel a little guilty for loving the series so much at all.<br /><br />If you're familiar with The Selection then you know that America Singer is competing to marry Prince Maxon in a publicized Bacheloresque competition that she originally wanted nothing to do with. She's already in love with Aspen, but Prince Maxon has proven to be worthy of her love as well. In The Elite, The Selection process is down to six girls, including America. America is the underdog to the public, coming from the most lowly caste, but to Prince Maxon she just has to tell him she wants to spend the rest of her life with him and she's the winner. But America struggles with her love for Maxon, her love for Aspen (now a castle guard), and ultimately the responsibility of being a princess.<br /><br />I really want to give this book 4 stars, but more than the first half is almost nothing but America whining about how much she loves Maxon and then she doesn't, so she loves Aspen because he's dependable, but then she's so jealous of Maxon's relationship with the other girls that she loves him again and the cycle repeats. I thought the wishy washy love triangle was okay for the first book when the reader was being wooed by both Maxon and Aspen right alongside America; but in the second book I hoped for something more. I understand that a certain level of back and forth is relevant for America to come to a decision, but most of the book feels just like repetition fromThe Selection. I can't say I didn't enjoy it and it did have its redeeming qualities; America's distrust of Maxon makes her so unstable in their relationship that it turns her into someone she is not, namely the girl with whom Maxon fell in love. When Maxon begins to spend more time with other girls, I can't say I blame him and this adds a new dynamic to their love story.<br /><br />By the last third of the book, the story does pick up, so don't give up hope completely. I was especially eager to learn more about the attacks on the castle and the war with New Asia (although I was really expecting more).  Despite spending so much time on the love triangle, Cass proves herself an excellent storyteller in many details, my favorite being Aspen's acknowledgement that he and Maxon are competing in their own version of The Selection for America. I also like the way Cass shifts the reader's perspective of characters through plot points, like my opinion of Maxon and Marlee (I would say more, but I don't want to spoil anything for you!).<br /><br />While I was disappointed with the substance of The Elite, I can't say I didn't love it. America's struggle with her identity is made even more difficult by the love triangle in which she has entrenched herself; she gauges her strengths and weaknesses against each of her suitors, but it isn't until she examines herself without the backdrop of a man that she realizes her strengths and redeems herself as a strong female protagonist. And for the record, I don't think readers give these dystopian heroines (America, Katniss, Tris...) enough credit for all they have to go through as teenage girls! For that and many other reasons, I highly recommend this series overall but am less enthused about this content of this book.<br /><br />Bottom Line: A must read if you loved The Selection, but if you didn't love the first book you probably won't be as forgiving about this one as I was. 3.5/5 Stars
B00C7KYXHW|5.0|Very interesting insight of the mind of serial killers.  Interesting plots lines.  The acting is superior, with the lead character intriguing.
B001XV3LSS|4.0|An original concept which is so rare these days with all the remakes.  Jodie Foster does a great job in this role.  Wish they would have made a sequel.
B004UHL9EK|5.0|I was really surprised by this app.  I had low expectations based on my experience with similar applications but this one really shines.  It has a ton of functionality, allows for a lot of customization and it works great.  I highly recommend it!
B0071XO8RA|4.0|I would have given this a five, but Mr Howey can be longwinded.  There were portions of this book that seemed irresponsibly detailed.  Perhaps the intent was to build suspense or explain the skill set of the characters.  However, I did not need to read how to  remove bolts from a pump and wire a motor.  The problem with this kind of detail is that some people actually can do this kind of work. Mr Howey is not an expert, so I found myself saying that the work would never suffice. I wish he would just get to the point and say the pump was rewired.  Furthermore, I found myself saying that the diversions into detail background came at the wrong moment.  Just when the story had momentum, the scene would switch to some mundane description.  I know some would call this style, but when I notice it, and it is irritating, then I think the writer was trying too hard.<br />That all being said, I would recommend this book to people interested in this kind of subject.  It kept me reading, even if I had to move quickly past some of the detail explanations.
B000FVE3BG|5.0|love the invicta line,  this is my fourth invicta. what a great value for the price! by the way it does get noticed. many compliments on it
B005LAIHCW|5.0|Let's just say I am watching all of Ms. Jennifer Lawrence movies because of reasons other than entertainment. If you continue you may learn why. First, the two female leads, Ms. Lawrence and Ms. Shue, have three Oscar nominations and one win between them. You would have to  go back decades for a cast with this amount of industry acclaim. And unlike typical Hollywood casting, they play mother and daughter and look the part. This  movie is in the tradition of Alfred Hitchcock's &#34;Psycho.&#34; So no real surprises, but the director  does generate considerable suspense. The director is no Hitchcock, but who else is? Ms.  Lawrence's statuesque beauty and natural acting talent are impressive and palpable. One cautionary note: Ms. Lawrence's foul-mouth bravado can't hide the insecurity, bewilderment and vulnerability that are just below the surface. Remember how Ms. Lindsay Lohan self-destructed and she has similar talent and beauty.  So the people who are charged with taking care of her, and she has  them, should be alert and vigilant.
B0012NIF56|3.0|I loved this movie as a kid.  As an adult it just does not age well.  Watch it with your 8 years old and they will probably think it is fantastic.
B00BHXUC8E|4.0|Yeah, the volume is turned up quite a bit on the mix. I mean, it's way more than what I like. I'm not really against how many discs have the volume turned up but this one is a bit high to the point that the bass and drums are a bit distorted at times.<br /><br />As for the music? Great. Many of the older songs have been dropped a key. I'm guessing that David is having a hard time hitting the higher notes of the old stuff. That's understandable as our fave singers age.<br /><br />4 stars for the product and the music. One knocked off for the excessive brickwall.
B008Y79IUE|4.0|Don't expect this movie to make you feel good.  It is absolutely intense with some horrible visuals.  Difficult to sit through, which means it provides a great perspective for addiction.  This movie teeters on being a classic.
B009NG1Q96|1.0|If you liked twilight then this is your novel. But if you actually like realistic and non-obnoxious characters then this is not your cup of tea. The elite is basically all filler fluff. By filler fluff I mean a stupid love triangle filled with annoying dialogue. It ends so there has to be another novel. So I have come to the conclusion that the author is just trying to make money off of these disgusting excuse of a novel. I will have to reread Bitterblue to get the head ache of a pathetic read out of my head.
B00BGIC2J2|2.0|This movie is utterly forgettable.  There is no real story and you never buy into there being any serious issue between the couples.  Ultimately you are just watching them go through a week or so in their life.<br /><br />The trailer is much funnier than the movie.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|What a great read. I was anxious to find out the ending was happy that resolution was found. Amazing story.
B00BHMETKC|5.0|Were you worn in the 70s?  Want to see a bit of nostalgia? Argo is the movie for you.  As with most of the best movies, it provides a bit of comedy with serious life events.
B00BMKDTNC|5.0|This was a good end to an epic I would have enjoyed knowing what happened after but I suspect that might be another book. Recommend this book only if you've read the previous titles. Thank you Brandon Sanderson ! Bless your imagination Robert Jordan your creativity will inspire so many others like a rock being thrown into a still pond.
B00C1BU7V8|5.0|Easy to rent from Amazon to watch in the comfort of home. Had a small transmission problem quickly resolved by Amazon Kindle Dept.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I love this game! It's so addicting and easy and fun! I love the rail road part where you have to tip your device :) I rate this as a 5 star game
B006GLM5EQ|5.0|Love this series. Each episode adds a layer to the story and keeps you watching. The series doesn't hide the gore and lust behind the idea of vampires.
1401937268|5.0|There was nothing wrong with the transaction or the cards. Illustrations are beautiful and they are very descriptive and easy to use. Guide book is very helpful. I would recommend this product to anyone that likes angles, fairies, unicorns, or mermaids and needs a descriptive and helpful deck of tart cards. I personally am not really into the fantasy stuff but it is a comfortable, beautiful, and less harsh than the traditional tarot without looking any of the meanings.
B009LXEBD4|5.0|Wow! I love this cd! I haven't stopped listening to it since I got it! It's driving my husband crazy, but I just can't get enough!
B006OAB432|5.0|This product is great! Mine arrived in perfect condition, and I've listened to it non-stop since. Definitely a must-have for fun. fans!
B00BSBT8M6|5.0|This is one of the rare cases where the movie is as good or better than the book.  Great action and excellent acting.
B001NHJTKG|5.0|This album is a true classic. Great music astounding nlyrics true sense of a specific musical genre. Knofler shows true genius in many of his riffs and and can stand on stage with any of the guitar greats. Gotta have it in your collection.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|A peek into early 20th century life.  As I watched I started getting attached to the characters and caring about what is happening to them.  I love the fashion!  It's just a beautiful show, well written that will draw you in from the start.  I wish there were more quality shows like this.
B00AM0HPDS|5.0|This is as impressive a debut album as I've heard in a long time. Classically trained in composition in addition to being a fantastic singer, Laura Mvula combines a strong, accessible sense of melody with sophisticated rhythm and syncopation and challenging harmonies.<br /><br />I read something categorizing Laura Mvula has combining \\"classic soul\\" with something-or-other, and I feared the worst: another young singer out to re-hash Aretha Franklin. But from the first blast of dissonant harmony that launches the lead track \\"Like the Morning Dew\\", I was shocked. I immediately sat up and paid attention -- I knew I wasn't about to be spoon-fed some dreary attempt at a Motown revival. Don't get me wrong, I love Motown, but I also like music to have a strong spark of originality.<br /><br />And there is no doubt that Laura Mvula has that. Not many \\"classic soul\\" singers would venture into an anthem in 7/4 time like \\"Flying Without You\\", or the plaintive off-beat vocal fade out of \\"Father Father\\". Not to mention the harmonies, which can be so beautifully unexpected that they hit you like a jolt.<br /><br />But thankfully, there is more to this music than complexity -- it also has feeling, power, rhythm, beauty, and a good sense of fun. The lyrics are often pointed, sometimes funny, and usually thought-provoking.<br /><br />Laura Mvula and her co-writer and producer Scott Brown have also recognized how well her voice, strong in the lower registers, goes along with high-pitched tinkling instruments -- harp, vibraphone, glockenspiel and I think I even heard a celesta in there. The sounds blend wonderfully into a cohesive whole that is deceptive in its smoothness.<br /><br />This is a masterful album that shows energy and innovation in composition as well as skill and beauty in performance. I am really impressed. Heartily recommended.
B00BD47WGM|5.0|What a great read. You really come to love these ladies and their families; rejoicing with them as we'll as crying too.
0896760278|4.0|This book has line drawings only, thus does not have the same appeal as the &#34;Fashion in Detail&#34; series. However, the garment construction information is very detailed. I thought I might want to copy some of the fashions or details, but they are way too complex for me. Hard to imagine what it took to make these clothes back in the day!
B008393Q2O|3.0|It comes in handy for quick little notes to myself or for grocery list or to do lists . I find  that I am not very good with it...with ideas
1851775722|5.0|Although the fashions in this book are of an era that doesn't really appeal to me in terms of their style - i.e. I would never copy one of these - it is fascinating to see the details and read about how these garments were constructed. The undergarments required for these garments were amazing - heavily boned corsets, steel hoops, etc. I'd like to see dozens more of these books!
B0064QNS62|2.0|This game was not what I expected at all.  I found it rather dull. I am not sure what I expected.  Don't take my word for it...try it yourself.
B00CDSVZHY|5.0|I am a fan of Leonardo DiCaprio, and that is the main reason I rented it. I loved it. While I have nothing against Tarrantino, I am not one of his die-hard fans. I found the movie very entertaining, and the parts that were funny, were really funny. I would watch it again.
B008XNZMOU|3.0|Yes I like some of these songs but i miss her old albums, fearless,and taylor swift. I miss her big curls, and country songs for example, Our Song, change, etc. It's good she's trying other genres, but like they always say if it ain't broke don't fix it. Taylor should go back to country.
B00APUQRPC|5.0|Really liking Clint Eastwood... really has the whole ornery old man down pat.<br />But was a pleasant story about family and ended happily.
0345472322|4.0|Mind opening book that will put all aspects of your life in perspective. Everyone from cooperations to churches should read this book.
B00BF11STU|4.0|Better story and character development...<br />I mean... we kind of know how it is going to end, but was entertained by the story behind it.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This game is fun but sometimes glitches on me. I will really think about getting it because I'd be fun for long road trips
030758836X|1.0|While this book has been on the best seller list for a long time, I found it disappointing.  I admired the writing as skilled, but by the end of the book I felt like the two characters deserved each other.  That, of course, raises the question of whether the reader needs to like the characters.  I'm not sure I know the answer.  I only know that as I see it listed time after time on the best sellers list, I wonder if it is like the emperor's clothes and readers jump to join the crowd of other readers who have deemed it worthy.  All I know is that it did not inspire me to pick up her other books while other authors have.
B00AQCMK32|5.0|This game is fun and awesome the only part I don't like is when your business fails. The price is a little high but worth every penny
B00B4VI8MQ|4.0|This game is your basic run of the mill HO game. The storyline is easy to follow. The reason it did not get 5 stars is the game was short. was able to finish the full game quickly.
B0050DIWFC|4.0|That seems like an odd thing to say about a crime novel, but this is not your standard crime novel.<br /><br />I kept seeing this book in my recommended reading lists and kept skipping over it. I didn't want a procedural detective story or a long wallow in the many forms of human depravity. There are so many of those and they just get tiresome.<br /><br />I don't know what finally won me over, why I decided to give it a try, but I'm glad I did. My only complaint is that I could have read another hundred or more pages. I didn't want the book to end.<br /><br />Because it's not a procedural law & order type novel, and it doesn't delight in criminal deviancy. There are no tricks or stunts for sheer dramatic effect. It reads as if it's truly a first-person account, almost a journal, chronicling not only the events around the story but the internal dialogue and struggle of the narrator to understand and come to terms with what has happened.<br /><br />Alas, I've finished it and can't will the story to go on. So I'll do what I always do -- download everything else the author has produced and settle in, knowing, from the experience of reading this book, that I'm in good hands.
B0040I09RM|5.0|This was a show I always wanted to check out, but never really had the time to invest in when it came out.  It was a real opportunity to see the show from the beginning when it was added to Amazon Prime.  I'm glad I did, and am now hooked!<br /><br />Some of the acting is cheezy and story line predictable, but entertaining, none the less, and much better than most everything on TV, today.

B0064X7FVE|2.0|Application uses poor screen real-estate layout and usage.  There are large areas of blank space on the screen filled with more ads than actual weather data.  I found 2 other apps.  Weatherbug and AccuWeather that have better user interfaces than TWC.  I so wanted this app to be my go-to weather app., but it just didn't make the cut.  Maybe next time...
B0080M3OGW|2.0|For a great group of Actors, extremely slow movie.  Would not recommend!  Watch Bridges of Madison County or any of the other good movies.
B005K17RU0|4.0|Here's my dilemma.  I like the Weather Channel app on the Kindle Fire better than the AccuWeather app., but I like the AccuWeather app on my android phone better than TWC app. on my cell phone.  Since knowing the weather on my cell phone is much more important and relevant than know the weather on my wi-fi based Kindle Fire,  I choose the AccuWeather app. over TWC app., at least in this version/release/iteration.
B006KX3GXO|5.0|I use this product to edit all photos that I forward to Facebook. I post a photo of my granddaughter every day. It creates collages, crops, enhances, and lets you write on a photo.
B00AKL1XPU|3.0|Game was okay to play. I was impressed with how it ran on a portable device. My biggest gripe is that &#34;Free to Play&#34; ends pretty quickly just as you begin to build your zoo.  Kind of limited my interest and it lost appeal as soon as I ran low on in-game chits.
1400052181|5.0|Very compelling book for both scientific minds and socially concerned readers. The story is definitely a page turner and I greatly enjoyed reading it.
B00AYM6JFO|4.0|I don't think Willie Nelson can make a bad CD, I purchased this one, because it has several songs that are not on other CD'S.
B00B6QXN56|5.0|This CD is the perfect answer for people who want to hear &#34;real music&#34;.  So much talent showcased.  Would recommend this to everyone.
B00AFEY354|5.0|I watched this with my  16 yr. old Grandson, and he loved it, he wanted it for his upcoming birthday.
