B00005JKG5|5.0|This movie is one that harkens back to a time of good romance & has extra with great dancing.  Jennifer was outstanding.
B001NLKT60|5.0|Great book that leaves off with a awesome cliff hanger and let's the reader wonder. It will be interesting to see how the author ends the series.
B003Y5H5HO|5.0|This is a must have for any action fan or fan of mysteries.  Does have some X-rated parts.  Totally caught me off guard at the end for I could not identify the killer.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|Love it! I can set multiple alarms along with a timer. Easy to use. Also a plus that it is free!
B000Z6RH32|5.0|This DVD is one all fans of M. Douglas need in their collection.  Both are suspenseful & keep viewer on edge of seat.  Great.
B00APUYWYA|1.0|The movie was great, the streaming on amazons part was terrible. It wasn't choppy but the images were lured on several occasions throughout the movie!!
B0055PGUYU|1.0|The first two chapters would be a good introduction if the book pursued and developed the topic. It doesn't. The author can certainly paint a picture but that is about all he can do. He never clearly defines what a habit is and then in later chapters begins to call anything and everything a habit (in one chapter he calls friendship a habit). Mr. Duhigg does nothing more than string together dozens of unrelated but slightly hooking stories. Each one is interesting in its own right, but useless to prove or help his point. I read this book thinking it would be an insightful scientific discussion of habits and habit forming behaviors, but it is nothing more than a self-help book. Every other paragraph is just filler attempting to suggest that what you are about to read is something that shocked the scientific community and could bring businesses to their knees. The instructions at the end about how to put the ideas presented in the book into practice are laughable. In the end there is little more than a pamphlet's worth of information here (and a rather dry one at that). Please save your money and do not buy. There is nothing fascinating or groundbreaking here and certainly nothing that will help you positively effect your life/behavior.
B003Y5H5HO|4.0|Not quite as good as the Swedish version but still edgy. I actually  liked the Original Swedish ending much better.
B0019GO58C|3.0|Great Movie, way too expensive.  For a movie that has been out this long and being sold by Amazon, I think the price should have been half of what it was.
B0072GPQNG|5.0|I heard alot about this movie. Some people said it was fair and others said it was great. To me his is a film that the family can view. I would not let under 12 view it but above yes. To see the love one aminal can bring to so many and the hardship the Horse can have but return to the one it loves is great.
B008FYZIVY|4.0|Really love this series and after watching the chopped up airings on PBS and reading a number of the other reviews,<br />I decided to order this set.  It came very fast and have watched 95% in two days.  However, one of the episode, on one of the discs had a problem where it would just stop.  I played that section over a couple of times and it always had the same problem.  This flaw is also mentioned in the reviews by another individual.  Other than that, I'd say, buy it, you won't be sorry.
B003Z4JQH6|5.0|Cant say enough about these comfortable sandals,3rd pair now,had them tested by a podiatrist,best even foot sole for your back,posture comfort etc!!!
B0094J2Y7A|1.0|Don't bother buying from here, this is way overpriced.  Lego.com has the same set for $24.99.  Don't get ripped off!
B00785P2QC|4.0|its a fun game.  I don't like how you have to purchase things with real money. I'm glad it was free.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|This book is incredibly insightful. It is well written and encouraged me to think. I was hesitant because I don't usually like reading about high school age people but this book is making me reevaluate that opinion. This book was amazing and I would definitely recommend it.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|I loved this book and so did my twelve year old son.  A great story about the real heroes that night in May.
0525952926|3.0|With all the research that was done to collect the history of the events that are central to the story, it's too bad that the characters' introduction to sex became such a focus. It would have been a much shorter book if the sexual exploits had been passed over.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|I choose 5 stars cAuse I LOVE diary of a wimpy kid. I have read each one and all of them are amazing. So read this book is really amazing..!!!
1419705849|5.0|My Grandson really enjoys Diary of a Wimpy Kid and as all of them.  He has already read this one and waiting for the next one.
B0071XO8RA|4.0|It doesn't have the most grabbing beginning.  I didn't get really pulled in to the story for a while, but then, wow, I was captured.  At first I thought it was going to be predictable, but... not at all.  Full of surprises!
B007XF0X16|2.0|Since I knew the director is Jonathan Liebesman (Battle: Los Angeles), i had low expectation on this film. The result is within my consideration.
B000W7JWUA|5.0|We played this game at a relatives house over the summer,  the kids liked it so much we bought it as a family Christmas present.  FUN FUN FUN !  Similar to Monopoly in that you can get (Community Chest / Chance like) cards that allow you to get further in the game.  Similar to Risk in that you obtain territories and armies.  Just an over all fun game to play. I highly recommend it for the family. You will need to get the expansion set if you want to play with more than 4 people.  We did that as well. Very fun game to play.
1419705849|5.0|My son, who doesn't really enjoy reading has read all of these books!  He read it in one evening and loved it!
B005ONTD42|1.0|I received a sealed case with all the protective cardboard filling but there was no ball or charging pod as displayed on internet.<br /><br />FS Hobby and Toys answered my emails promptly but they did not give me any solution, they just said:<br /><br />&#34;We have encountered two incidents early in the Christmas season where the customer said they have not received their sphere ball and we have taken extra precaution to make sure our future order does indeed have the sphero ball before shipment. This subsequent precaution includes your shipment&#34;<br /><br />To sum up, I paid for a toy, I never got it and no one can take responsibility.<br /><br />This was a Christmas gift and I am totally disappointed
B0052CK5PQ|1.0|What a bore Caitlin Moran is. This has to be the worst non-fiction book I've ever read. it's repetitious, there's nothing new in it at all. As it was recommended to me, I kept turning the pages, hoping to find some nugget of gold. But alas, there was none. Just the same old stuff regurgitated. I found her stand on abortion to be pitiful - how sad that it took her longer to choose her kitchen worktops than to decide to abort her baby. I feel sorry for her. Maybe when she gets older - and I'm just a tad more than 59 which is old to her - she might have something interesting to say. She falls very short of her ambition to write a 'funny' book.  How to be a Woman does nothing to advance the cause of feminism.
B003QSMC18|5.0|I think this is a great Disney movie because it features Disney's first African American princess, as well as a princess who is driven to work really hard to make her dreams come true instead of just relying on wishing and magic, etc.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I always look forward to Nicholas Sparks books. They can have me smiling, laughing, gasping, and crying. This book is another great work of his. With twists I didn't see coming. I don't think he can ever disappoint.
B001UV4XIS|5.0|I own all Harry Potter movies.  I love ALL of my HP movies.  I can watch these movies over and over again. The movie was in GREAT condition and at a good price.
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|its fun but its going to take a lot of practice for me to get better at it ./no good at games
B0064NTZQ2|4.0|Love Ryan Gosling in this movie.  Quiet and mysterious.....that's always good. This movie has some violence in it.  Good movie.
B007ZGBZHE|5.0|still reading but love it already//all the penergast novels have been the best and I have a hard time putting them down, I love his character
B007J4T2G8|3.0|It was not a romantic novel that I am used to.  The sexual content is more like porn.  In which I don't view.  Will read the other two just cause my daughter got them
B009FZHYKU|5.0|My son introduced me to this series and I'm HOOKED.  I watched 3 seasons in 2 days.  Can't wait until the new season begins.
0385535147|5.0|Got my nose stuck in this legal thriller when I myself was stuck at OAK because of flight delays. My first Grisham novel, an exciting legal thriller that has you turning the page. I am almost to the end and it's probably the fastest time I've ever read through a novel. Good buy if you like legal/thriller books.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|Loved the game. Great graphics and storyline. Would recommend this to anyone who loves a good mystery. Keeps you wondering whats next..
1936608898|5.0|Great book with great information!  There is a lot of information new to me.  I am gong to look for it to upload onto my Kindle.
B005ZUR724|5.0|Runs great on the tablet and is definitely packed with hours of gameplay! Overall a must buy in my opinion.
B0083DJWGO|5.0|Taleb has a fascinating, far-ranging mind.  He brings new perspective to many aspects of our lives.  This book is at times profound and at times quirky, but it is consistently interesting.  Everyone should read it.  Twice.
B0063GORYU|5.0|This is the best way to get the most common type of relief ,after a long day of work. I love this game.
B000ICXQXI|5.0|The picture was clear and as always the movie was great!  Would recommend using amazon to others, it was very easy to use.
B009HELT3C|5.0|After MIB2 I was not expecting much from the third, even after hearing how it was supposed to be better. I was rather shocked to find that not only was it better as expected, but actually just as good as the original and in some ways lives up to the potential of the MIB universe even more than the first. And Josh Brolin's Tommy Lee Jones impression is worth the price of the movie on its own. You can't miss this performance.
B004LP3AYI|2.0|The story was fantastic I liked the first book of the series, but it is a very hard read when the, they, them, or a, am, an are mixed up in the writing of the story. At times I would have to read a sentence 2 or 3 times to get the point. I do hope there is a rewrite of this book in the future it has a good story.
B00AXXTR7Q|5.0|The writing, storyline, plot, acting, all retain a wonderful tension leaving this viewer to only want more.  I am especially gratified to see Michael J. Fox and his acting \\"chops\\" with such fine work.
0375851569|5.0|It was on time, what it was specified and in very good conditions, i recomend them.<br />Thanks for every thing
B00A6PD8RQ|5.0|All I can say is that it is an animated movie that can be watched by both a grandfather and his grand daughter and both will enjoy it equally.
B00785P2QC|4.0|It's fun but takes a while to get credits so if you can't spent real money to buy credits it takes forever and gets to be really boring
B00355L2TU|5.0|I did this program a few years ago.  Now I'm home with a newborn, and find time to do it right in my living room while the baby is taking his afternoon nap.  :)
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|It was an absolutely incredible title. I loved it. It made everything in the world seem peaceful and chaotic at the same time.
B000BYCAJE|5.0|More music that can't be duplicated.  You offer a great selection and very little wait time to start enjoying .<br />thank you agan
0761169431|5.0|Bought this for my adult son and he loved it. He was shocked when he opened the gift and has done a few already.
B00A8ECU24|2.0|It's a fun time-waster, but items/ponies cost too much. All ponies should cost coins, not gems. Save gems for the unnecessary things like decorative items. THERE'S NO EXIT ON KINDLE FIRE. I have to shut down the KF to exit the game.<br />Also, on KF the Friends/Social aspect of the game doesn't work. You can invite friends, but they never get added, & only show as invites. The only \\"Friend\\" you're able to interact with is the built-in \\"Cellestia\\". You can only visit her, gift, or give treasure. If the social aspect of the game won't work, you can't get the gem hearts needed to \\"purchase\\" some of the ponies. If that's not fixed in an update, hopefully the game makers will add a way to get the gem hearts in another way, (like the balloon game) or put in the ability to get the hearts at Cellestia's town.
0670026603|5.0|Since anything by Moyes is \\"required\\" reading for me, I anxiously awaited this book.  I had no pre-knowledge as to what it was about.  By the time I finished, I had plenty of new knowledge about what life is about.  Whether you agree with the plot or not, in my opinion, this is a book that every reader should spend a few days with.  So thought provoking.  Poor Louisa, Poor Will, but at the same time courage and humor all around.  I will never forget this love story.
0385006896|5.0|It was a used book so it does have the normal wear and tear such as spine and cover damage but a lovely anthology
B004I2K4DY|5.0|Absolutely wonderful! Boe, Lewis, Solanga, Barks and Karimloo are especially excellent. The orchestra is outstanding (I can't emphasize this enough)! Plus the encores at the end... The setting at the O2... You'll watch this over and over.<br /><br />The Amazon review was unenthusiastic about Jonas, and I have to agree. It's not unacceptable though. But there are times when he is singing along with Karimloo and Boe's characters and the contrast is obvious and unflattering. But the Marius character is torn between his commitment at the barricade and his new love for Cosette, and Jonas presents that just fine, generally.<br /><br />The Amazon reviewer also said, \\"Lea Salonga is now Fantine, and while she sings well, the part really calls for more vocal power.\\" Huh? Salonga seems to epitomize power in her singing here.<br /><br />Alfie Boe is triumphant in this concert. What an extraordinary talent!<br /><br />Buy it. Put it on, crank your speakers up. Powerhouse orchestra, massive supporting chorus, well-cast singers on stage. Get ready to have your socks knocked off.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|Excellent book. Going back to page one to read it again. Very detailed recollection. It's like I was at the author's side living this chain of events personally. Highly recommended!
B004J4WKTW|5.0|A truly amazing story. It is hard to put into words but I would highly recommend this book. Once I got to the last third of the book I literally couldn't put it down until I had finished it all.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|I had a great time putting the pieces together.wasn't all that eddy but wasn't all that hard. Story line was interesting as well. Wish it was longer though. Worth it to me.
B009NPKTN6|5.0|I LOVED this movie.  I was a little wary of ordering it because of the bad reviews it received, but am certainly glad I didn't listen.  Just a warning, if you don't like musicals, you probably wouldn't like it.  However I love musicals so this was perfect for me.  As usual Tom Cruise poured his heart and soul into this role.  His voice was amazing as well.  Julianne Hough proved she is more than just a pretty face.  The music was amazing.  In fact I intend to purchase the soundtrack today.  If you want a fun movie with great music, I highly recommend this one.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|I recommend this book to anyone. I read it in a day. Fantastic book. You can not put it down.
B009EJSQ3G|4.0|As a many decade ABBA fan I have enjoyed seeing how their popularity has risen again since the Mamma Mia play & movie. Without this I doubt there would have ever been any special editions or re-releasing of their music and videos. I have really liked the special editions more for the DVD of TV perfromances or live excerpts. The CD is a bonus as I would have bought them even if it were only the DVD's. I have bought all the special editions except The Visitor. By far the best is Voulez Vous as the production values were excellent including the menus. I wonder why they didn't apply the same production values to all the special editions? The others I have are simple menus and no frills. I also don't think they did alot to polish the videos other than sound but perhaps due to the fact the perfomances were over 30 years ago on TV they couldn't do much to spruce them up. If there was a way to do that I would give all the special editions 5 stars across the board. The selection of the videos are top notch and mostly match the content of the album they represent. I wish all songs were represented as there are videos for most songs available but they went only with the television specials they did and didn't add extra songs beyond that. I especially was disappointed that &#34;I've Been Waiting For You&#34;, my favorite Agnetha song, was only played as background music for the sleeve gallery and not as a video which can be found. Why it was omitted is unknown. The same was true of Voulez Vous on another special edition which is the title song but no video was included despite many available. This is of course nitpicking and I admit it. As a fan I always want more and to their credit they did a good job overall on these special editions. This ABBA edition, Voulez Vous & Arrival are the best and have the most content. Super Trouper & ABBA: The Album have only limited content. I can't speak to The Visitor as I mentioned before as I didn't get it. I know my review covers more thanthis ABBA special edition and I apologize for that so now I will give my review of this specific item. Its excellent overall. There is a TV special from Australia and some added vidoes of some of the same songs performed differently in different videos. This is normal for the special editions to do this. This TV show is very good and you will know all the songs. They made good choices for this show. The songs are all mimed to the actual songs. I honestly don't know if this was done in the original shows but suspect they were. Again, this is normal for all the special editions. There are very few &#34;live&#34; songs sung. This doesn't really bother me as they do such a good job of syncing it up. There is no doubt ABBA worked hard on doing a good job on their TV shows. They didn't tour much by choice and these TV shows are how they primarily connected with fans. I admire all the shows they did. This is my favorite special edition by far. It lacks the polish of Voulez Vous as mentioned before and again makes me wonder why they didn't apply the same standards to all the special editions? I think this is the best one though in terms of more well-known songs they have done. New fans of ABBA might like this edition the best as a &#34;starter&#34; because of this. I hope they will do more special editions but there are only 1-2 albums left that don't have DVD additions. Crossing my fingers though. ABBA has music to fit all moods in my opinion. They never fail to cheer me up.
B0095ZMMCK|5.0|If you have read any of his books, this one continues the series in a thought provoking way.<br />The action is continuous.  The plot line believable.  And the story captivating.
B009RI4FRU|5.0|Almost as good as The Royal Tennenbaum's... definitely will be one of our favorite Wes Anderson movies. It is a must see!
B00APPJELG|4.0|Most of my friend and acquaintances think of me as \\"intellectual\\" and \\"scholarly.\\" ( I have been requested to give tours of the classical collection at the Metropolitan Museum of Art.)<br /><br />But none of this prevents me from thoroughly enjoying Downton Abby, which proves that lavish costume series laced with melodrama continue to hold their charm--apparently for a wide spectrum of viewers.<br /><br />While I'm in the mood to be brutally frank,allow me to say I found the first season dull as dishwater, and watched it mostly for the costumes and sets.  But the show's creators spiced up Season Two & I soon found myself looking forward to each episode!!<br /><br />The overwhelming question: Can they keep it up?  The trailer includes several promising subplots, & I fervently hope this season delivers all the guilty pleasure it promises.  On that note, it was too bad they had to kill off that gorgeous Turk.  I am a female viewer who hopes there will be some luscious eye candy ...
B008L5FFP6|5.0|Youngs guns are proving themselves to be a real solid group. Bones is a great album.  Can't wait to see what's next from them.
B001DJLD1M|5.0|highly suggest this for any matrix buff. It has the trilogy as well as the Animatrix. I got the blade one and had to get this as soon as I saw it. Great having the set all together.
B004478GN8|5.0|Anything Lego and Star Wars is always a hit!  Everyone is happy!  Waiting for the next occasion to buy other parts.
B009KKLQKO|5.0|Even after 50 years, the Beach Boys are still awesome in concert. Carl and Dennis will always be sorely missed, but it's great seeing and hearing Brian again. All fans should check this one out.
B007DA2FHG|4.0|The story was very compelling something like beach reading-the movie version. Of course, I would have been very unhappy if the story had ended on a sadder or more violent note.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|It is very easy to use app. You have your choice what version of bible you want to read. Which you can use other versions for refrences and studies. No complaints =-]
B004I2K4DY|5.0|So great to watch without fund raising interruptions on TV. Love the music, love the former cast members singing together at the end. For lovers of Les Mis, it's a must have.
1451620829|2.0|Of course, KISS' official website had to find and post a really bad review of this book when it was released. Their oh so mature way of saying \\"screw you, Peter.\\" It's very telling of the way all 4 original members of the band were/are childish, petty and ego-driven far beyond the normal. In a very real sense, they have always deserved each other.<br /><br />Peter Criss' book is obviously full of his self-justifications and excuses for idiotic behavior, but a lot less so than the embarrassing Ace Frehley book from last year. At least Criss seems to be more honest and more willing to face his demons than the Space Ace, who was just interested in recounting how many times he escaped jail-time because an officer recognized him and other crap like that.<br /><br />This one is a reasonably enjoyable read even if Criss' point of view is shockingly dumb at times. It predictably boils down to Simmons being the bad guy and Stanley the henchman, and Criss the under-appreciated everyman hero. Yawn. The best parts of the book are the discussions of making KISS' 70s albums and touring them, which Criss seems to remember a whole lot more about than Frehley. Criss also talks more in-depth about the reunion era, a period Frehley skips almost completely. Criss delivers sweet honesty on one issue: \\"KISS wanted to do a reunion. To me that meant millions of dollars, and I wanted it.\\"<br /><br />But really, it's beyond ludicrous when Criss still claims that KISS held him back and kept him down. Come on! Nearly 30 years after having been \\"liberated\\" from them, more than three decades of doing whatever he wants, what do we have? 'Let Me Rock You'? 'One For All'? It's been perfectly clear for ages that Criss has almost nothing to offer artistically. Which would be okay, if he accepted his gifts as they are and didn't still keep up the deception. Pathetic.<br /><br />The big problem with KISS autobiographies now is the fact that it's all written in such major hindsight, there is very littlesense of the thrill they experienced of being KISS, and so much jaded and disillusioned bad-mouthing of each other... I'm not sure KISS fans can take much more. Up until now we have Simmons' ridiculously self-important piece of hype, 'KISS and Make-Up', Frehley's delusional self-portrait, 'No Regrets', and Criss' effort which is somewhere in between the first two.<br /><br />Let's see if Stanley's upcoming book is more than The Great KISS Ego Battles, part 4...<br /><br />These guys sure don't live in the real world.
B008BM9L72|2.0|I was struggling with the first book very much,  I was so annoyed how dumb she was. Book two and three were a little bit better, although I wanted to scream at the girl most of the time how she can take this from him - not sexually, but in real life, this controlling was too much. The series are twisted love romance where a stupid girl believes she can turn the man to change his ways. Ok, it is a book and so should I take it, but... I do not know. I think the intro into this dominant/submissive thing was interesting, where else would you read about such thing, but I kind of did not like this. Handsome, powerful, full of money and so twisted and still able to turn ways... I think that it was too much to take for me even while reading a book.
0345501292|5.0|Just got this at Christmas and read a lot of it already.  It is very interesting especially for fans of the Indiana Jones movies.  Lots of details that you would never find anywhere else.
0345803507|5.0|I love this whole series of books!!!!  I read all three in a 7 day period.  I think Ana could just have listen to her inner self and just got on with it instead of trying to understand everything there is about this man!
B009738XXM|5.0|Great album! Even my 5 year old daughter loves all the songs!  Hope she will have a longer carrier in the music industry.
0425263916|4.0|I guess I had book hangover when I read this book.  I had read the whole Fifty Shades and nothing compares to those.  This more of them just getting down to business.  Seams like everytime they turned around they were doing it!!
B000FBJHEO|5.0|Interesting book. Definitely not an easy read but it makes you think. Especially since it parallels to events happening today.
0425263908|4.0|This book is good and I will probably read the one that is coming out in May but they are not Fifty Shades.......Its just 2 young people getting it on every time they turn around.....
B005LAIHYU|3.0|This was a real disappointment and I watch it and was not really impressed.I will trade tis one in for a movie that I really want
B00AMBH70S|5.0|Well done, I was reprehensive at first. No Matt Dameon, who else could possibly be Jason Bourne?<br />I throughley enjoyed it. Plenty of action a role played with excellence.<br />Highly recommend this movie.
B005LAIHPY|5.0|I was really getting excited waiting for this movie ti get here and when I got it I had to watch it as soon as I got it. This was one of the best movie's that I have seen in a while.
B009HEJXFS|2.0|Not as good as the others,<br />It occupied some free time,<br />Fair at best. Don't think I would recommend to anyone asking.
B004HDJNBI|5.0|School required this book. She wanted one to keep since she read it already and loved it. Thanks for the speedy mailing.
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|This book was amazing in so many ways. The characters were so fleshed out and realistically flawed. That said, I sometimes struggled with the main character a bit. She was likable, however she seemed to be extremely self-absorbed at times throughout the book. Admittedly, she was dealing with VERY difficult issues, but it seemed that even when things were good, she still a \\"taker\\" and very rarely a \\"giver\\". She accepted lunches, coffees, sodas, the gift of a phone, offers of friendship, constant emotional support, etc, without reciprocating, and often without even much apparent gratitude. That said, she was somehow still likable which speaks well of how the author created an emotion connection between reader and character.
B004EPZ06G|3.0|Except for the location switch, from Las Vegas to Bangkok, this three stooges caper pretty much copies and cashes in on the success of the first film. Same idea exactly, right down to the closing credit scroll of the crazed drunken/drugged night that none of them can remember the next day. Even Mike Tyson reappears at the end, just like the first one. To be fair, this moves along pretty well, and I wasn't bored. There are no dead spots. Just, there are no real laughs, either. You will see more full frontal penises than you may care for.
B004O88LPA|5.0|I saw this when it first came out and fell madly in love with it. I went looking for it in a digital format and was tickled silly to find it here on Amazon.<br /><br />David Jason is perfect as the inept \\"Wizzard\\" (how it's spelt on his pointy hat) Rincewind and Tim Curry, as always, chews the scenery as the overambitious and disdainful wizard Trymon. Sean Astin makes a very good Twoflower as well.<br /><br />It was icing on the Disc-shaped cake to have Jeremy Irons as Lord Vetinari.<br /><br />It's always fun to look for Sir PTerry's cameo appearances in the live-action Discworld movies.
B00574P964|5.0|Good movie. Clean humorous show. I would recommend. I I I I I I I I I I I I i
1401324649|5.0|Cute, fun read that flips from the present to the past over the 100 years of the extraordinary life of the main character.
B008AK8FHM|4.0|Well written and brings a great deal of comfort coming from a non-believer of near death experiences prior to his coma.
B00A8ECU24|2.0|I love my little pony the game is fun to get into but once you reach rarity you are expected to buy jewels and everything is to pricey
0743539133|5.0|I found it fascinating.  I am listening to the CD's of the book and often re-listened just to be sure I have the facts correct.  I have learned so much about the civil war and the background of the emancipation of the slaves.  Also it is amazing how much behind the scenes there was then as there is now.  Lincoln was a Master at politics<br />  I would recommend this book or auto book to all as it is interestingly written and makes learning easy and fun.
B009O2XY12|5.0|Would recommend game to anyone.  Starts out fairly easy, but then gets more difficult.  I enjoy the game alot, it's much hard after level 20.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|If you could change the past, would you? And, perhaps more importantly -- should you?<br /><br />King hits another one out of the park with the absolutely engrossing story of Jake Epperson, a high-school English teacher from 2011 who finds himself saddled with the improbable task of preventing Kennedy's assassination. On the assumption that the world will be a better place (starting with no Vietnam) if he can take out Oswald before November 1963, he agrees, and finds himself a stranger in a strange land: America, 1958. (The impetus and details of his trip there, I will leave for the reader. Suffice to say it's the only supernatural device in the story. All the monsters here are human.)<br /><br />The nod to Bradbury's \\"A Sound of Thunder\\" (from which the \\"butterfly effect\\" theory takes its name) is made loud and clear -- one character even mentions the story -- but King's fleshed-out version of the tale hits closer to home, with fully-realized characters who become much more to the reader than players in a cautionary tale. The meat of the story takes place as \\"George Amberson\\" builds a double-life for himself in the years leading up to that fateful day in Dallas.<br /><br />After some eventful stops, including the grim and familiar Derry, Maine, George makes his way to Texas, where he finds himself a job teaching high-school (back when you could easily fake your resume and identity) in idyllic small-town Jodie. There, he makes friends, falls in love with Sadie, the lovely high-school librarian with a tragic past, and drives a bitchin' car . . . all the while also observing Lee Oswald and his sad little family from near and far . . . and changing the course of history just a little bit every moment he spends there.<br /><br />While there are obviously science-fictional elements to 11/22/63, in some ways it's one of the most realistic of King's novels. It feels true, if you get my meaning. Take a spectacular attention to -- and obvious love for -- the period's details, add in what must have been an ungodly amount of research about that terrible day in Dallas, and finish with a star-crossed, complex, grown-up love story that gives The Time Traveler's Wife a run for its hankies, and you've about got the idea. And of course all of this is overlaid with the gripping sense of a ticking clock, as George's day of reckoning with Oswald draws inexorably closer. Can he do it? Will he?<br /><br />Ultimately, 11/22/63 isn't a book about the Kennedy assassination, about bad guys or monsters, or even about time-travel. It's a book about choices, about the paths we take and the ones we miss, about how our best intentions can still go . . . not-so-well. About how we change lives and let our own be changed in return. It's also propulsive, humane, sad, funny and thrilling reading. If you know someone who doesn't read King because they don't like all \\"that woo-woo stuff\\" (I'm looking at you, Mom), try slipping them this, and I can almost guarantee it will change their mind.  I do not know how Stephen King works his magic, but it just gets better with time., add in what must have been an ungodly amount of research about that terrible day in Dallas, and finish with a star-crossed, complex, grown-up love story that gives The Time Traveler's Wife a run for its hankies, and you've about got the idea.

B00APUYWYA|5.0|I actually wasn't sure if I'd like this movie. However, I was surprised to find how entertaining it was! It has the Glee factor without being too hokey and is a nice, lighthearted film that is really funny. Rebel Wilson is absolutely hilarious. Would recommend!
0451232577|5.0|Fascinating reading, very informative about Europe during WW2 and a perfect introduction to the next book in his trilogy, Winter of the World&#34;.  Might help more people understand what is going on in our current world!!!
B00571F26Y|5.0|This book really explains the why's and how's of getting rid of wheat products and the affects on your health. I have a wheat belly and really never knew why, other than the obvious of course. I'm so glad I bought this book.
B0024CEY36|5.0|Highly recommend this book.  All of his books cannot be put down until you find out what happened and this book is no exception.
B00APUQPX6|4.0|It was good, but not as good as the other Ice Age movies.  Worth renting if your kid likes Ice Age
B002G1YPH0|5.0|i like it, the temperature is kept at 28 degrees at idle and around 35 degrees at hard work, I recommend this
B000W93CHC|4.0|Really enjoyed reading World Without End.  I couldn't put it down.  It held my interest from the get go.  Good Read.
B0002VFXFE|4.0|works fine, the temperature is maintained at 28 degrees in idle and about 35 degrees at work, I recommend this
0307200477|3.0|The book is nice, it's much larger than I had imagined.  The book I had as a child was smaller in dimension.  Unfortunately, the book is bound with a plastic ring that separates from the book very easily.  You have to turn the pages very carefully to avoid pulling the book apart, not good for a child.
B002YCVWXQ|5.0|love this movie from beginning to end. I highly recommend watching Inglorious Basterds. My family really enjoyed watching the movie.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|so far i love it. great graphics and i feel like i could play it forever and ever and not get bores.
B0000028M7|5.0|Love Alice In Chains. This album has most of the songs I love by them. I rate this their best album.
B007UXSPK2|5.0|An excellent plot line that keeps you interested to the very end. Especially liked the ending and its tie in to the series overall.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|This book was phenomenal!  From the beginning it entrapped me...I couldn't wait to turn the next page!  Suspense is evident,as is romance, humor and mystery!  The ending didn't let me down!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I really enjoyed the readability of this book. Being an avid fan of realistically descriptive fiction makes the introduction to the Hunger Games series an obvious one. Suzanne Collins portrays characters you can relate to and really feel. Definitely looking forward to the next one! Anyone who likes Stefanie Meyer will appreciate this author and the general plot of this irony-filled story.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|This book was exciting, not preparing you for the final ending to come.  It kept you interested where you couldn't put the book down.
0805092447|4.0|I love the rhyming phrases and the visually vibrant colored animals! It's an excellent introductory book for colours, animals and words.
B008D19WBQ|1.0|I was so excited to receive my blu-ray copies of Friends...what a disappointment.  I previously owned the DVD's and they are fabulous.  Un-cut episodes and tons of extra's.  The Blu-ray's are the TV versions of the shows and there is so much missing from them.<br /><br />If you have the DVD's DO NOT BUY THE BLU-RAY'S.  If you haven't watched the dvd's then I recommend the blu-ray edition because you won't be missing out on anything.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This game is super fun and very addicting#!!! Some levels are very hard but is a good workout for your brain!
B006OCM0G0|5.0|I love this game! I love it because I can check it periodically and with my busy schedule its a plus. But I can decorate and spend time on it when I have free time.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|At first I really didn't think this book was gonna be that good.....I finished it last night.. I stayed up tell 5 am to finish this book...LOVED IT SO MUCH. A must read for sure... Thank you Silvia
B000059HB7|5.0|Love 'the Duke' and especially like those movies which have a good plot, but also have a bit of humor.  This one meets all those requirements.
0500289077|5.0|Simple, if you want to see what street photographers are doing around the world and get inside their thoughts at the same time, then you will enjoy this book. There are plenty of wonderul photos at which to look, and the insights from the photographers themselves makes this book one that you will go through time and again.<br /><br />However, if you are looking for a &#34; how-to &#34; book you will be disappointed. It doesn't give f-stops, shutter speeds, etc.<br /><br />I was looking for a book with plenty of photos with some insights into the photographers thinkings and this fits the bil for me. That is why I gave it 5 stars... :-)
1609611543|5.0|I absolutely love this book. The author clearly describes scientific facts, history and more recent facts in terms of wheat and its detriments. I would advise all to at least open their minds and give the book a read. I have referred many of my blog followers to check out this book as well.
B0085P2Z6E|3.0|I generally enjoy games like this. So I was excited to play, however......  It does not work well with my kindle fire. First off, the screen is too small and there isn't any way to enlarge it. My most frustrating issue was that items appeared in areas I can't see and now I'm stuck on a level because the game won't allow me to tap in the area of the item. Suck !!!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I have read this book at least 3 times; I always find myself going back to my favorite chapters! I highly reccommend this book to any women a little bored or needing a new lease in the BR! Gentlemen please read!
B002SSUQFG|1.0|The movement in this watch is noisy. Furthermore, mine broke much sooner than I would expect from a quality automatic. It now doesn't hold a wind. This is my first and last Seiko. They are not quality watches. I could have bought a quartz and the battery would have outlasted this thing.
B004I8WD6E|3.0|bought this for my iphone 4 white phone. The clear cover changes to yellow over time just like any other clear plastic. Unless you plan to replace every now and then, would not recommend it. Protects the phone /does its job.
B000W7JWUA|5.0|This is a great game for people that aren't big board game geeks. Guys, girls, everyone. Be careful though, it can get pretty competitive. Also, I'd recommend that you get the 5-6 player expansion ASAP.
B009JBZH54|5.0|Before buying this trilogy, we had already seen three movies.  We've finally joined this century & purchased our first blue-ray player.  This was literally the first blue-ray we purchased.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|it was hard to put the book down. It's action packed, and full of emotion. Can't wait to start book 2!
B007FH9GA6|2.0|This movie did not do the book justice at all. Daniel Craig made Bloomkvist seem comedic and unbelievable. Why would he walk back into the serial killer's house at the end of the movie, after he had already escaped. Stupid.
B002ZG97EC|5.0|this is a hilarious movie and there is a play option on the blu- ray that is lots of fun.
B009NPKTN6|2.0|I thought the film was silly and the storyline lacked any form of character development. There seemed to be a lot of miscast actors.
B00A1EOBJQ|5.0|Enjoy the music of the Nashville TV show and some of the best songs are on this recording.  I would expect some to rise on the country music charts as they are very well done.

B005CRQ4GU|5.0|If you liked any of Kinney's other books, this one will be a hit. Great and definitely worth your money.
B009KHCRVO|4.0|when i first heard about this movie some time ago, i knew i would have to see it.  the premise is outlandish, but in a fun way.  it is well done for an independent movie, and shows that we are entering an age where even movies that require lots of effects can be done for much less that the big studios spend.<br /><br />this is a comedy and it doesn't take itself to seriously.  it is far from a movie that will change your life, but it is great fun for something to watch on rainy day or weekend night.
B001F12J0C|5.0|I was very pleased with these movies. I got it as a Christmas gift and it was greatly loved by my Mother!
B009FZFONO|5.0|We're only half way through this season, but every single episode of the 3rd season has left me on the edge of my seat, eagerly awaiting the next.  The effects continue to improve with each season and the characters that I least like have mostly been killed off ;-).
B0076DELIG|5.0|I loved how Harry followed all the twists and turns to get to the truth.<br />The ending was a surprise.
B009RI4ZKC|5.0|The director sets this in the time of his childhood, which is a bit before mine, but I still connected with it very easily.  This movie is constantly fun and entertaining.  The cast is phenomenal!
B0060FXBNM|4.0|The film was good and it looks great in blu ray but there are no special features, no commentary, nothing extra. It is great if all you want is the movie but if you want extras forget it...
B008578PRK|4.0|This was one of the best horror movies I've seen in a while. It accomplishes this with subtlety that takes me back to a different era of horror.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Although you get the thrills you'd expect in a zombie program, like all good dramas, the show is really about the characters' relationships and growth. Parts of this season do get mired in haunted house gimmicks, but it's still excellent. Really looking forward to the rest of it.
B00AMBLDEE|4.0|it is hard not to be biased against this kind of change in a movie franchise, but this movie delivered what you want from an action-packed spy thriller.  I didn't find it as good as any of the Damon movies, but i still feel it deserves a good rating on its own merit.
B00AE2I4B6|4.0|If you want to feel like dancing then this is the movie to motivate you.  Great moves, great music, ok acting.
B00A9X9ORI|4.0|As long as you try not to focus on the logic of time travel, this movie should be very entertaining and a bit thought-provoking.  It deals with basic, but always relevant moral questions in an interesting sci-fi scenario.
B008FYZIVY|5.0|Terrific period piece with a compelling set of narratives. Maggie Smith is as outstanding as always. We enjoyed every moment of this magnificent series.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|Book two of this trilogy was as good as the first one. Can't wait for book number three to come out!!

B007J4T2G8|5.0|Not something I would read, but was recommemded by my sister. I was hooked, couldn't put my kindle down. Lost lots of sleep.
B006BAEQB2|2.0|I've read too many of Phillippa Gregory's books....I'm tired of them so think I will take a break.  I think she's saturated the market.
B0095ZQ36G|5.0|I've read a number of books involving WWII and especially about air battles.  This was one of the best.  I gained a new understanding from the perspectives of German Air Force officers which I had not known.  I also gained much information about the German planes especially the 262 which I had not learned before.  The story of these two pilots search and reunion was very touching.  I would highly recommend it.

B0083SBMBM|5.0|Liked this DVD.  It was clean.  It was action packed.  It came on time.  I sincerely appreciate clean films that our entire family can watch.
B00000IZOR|3.0|My daughter who is one loses interest in this toy only after a few minutes of playing. The dial on the phone is too hard for her to circle around. The receiver part of the phone is awkwardly made because if you put the receiver next to your ear the whole phone comes up with it. I know the string cannot be long due to choking hazards but it is still an annoyance to my daughter.

B000QRIGLC|4.0|Once you get past the first three chapters of the book it becomes hard to put down. The only reason I did not give it top rating was because of the first three chapters. I wasn't to interested in the making of a Seal but the story he had to tell after those chapters. Overall it was a great read once i got past the three chapters that felt like Seal propaganda to me.
B0070Y46UY|5.0|This book was amazing! Kind of boring in the beginning, but be patient, it's so worth it. I was a sooo surprised by the ending. Great read, but is very graphic.
B004J4WLB4|5.0|This is a heartbreakingly deep and painful journey of the human soul searching for connection and safety while courageously journeying the physical realm. The ending is satisfyingly simple and complex all at the same time.  Good read.

B008JGSM6G|5.0|This game is so addicting.  It has many different levels from 5x5 all the way up to 14x14 which are very tough.  There is even timed trials so you can see how many boards you can beat in a certain amount of time.  I would definitely recommend this.

1401233791|3.0|Years and years ago the writers of Batman decided that his villains should be more than just colorful; they should all be criminally insane. I've generally just rolled with it but this is the first time I can remember where I started to cringe.<br /><br />Knightfall is the very slight inspiration for The Dark Knight Rises in that it features Bane breaking The Batman's back. In this story Bane's plot is to break all the criminally insane patients out of Arkham Asylum and wear down The Batman as he rounds them all up. Unfortunately for our hero he appears to be badly under the weather even before the criminals are freed and over time continues to deteriorate. This was an ambitious project for DC spanning 12 issues from the breakout to the back breaking on the second to the last page and this is only the first of three volumes.<br /><br />So here is my issue with this story. In the DC universe mental problems don't cause one to become depressed, withdrawn and sometimes suicidal. No. Here mental problems cause one to become focused, obsessive, criminal and charismatic (hence the ability to attract henchmen). There is a character in the story intended to be your typical naïve liberal more concerned with the criminally insane than the citizens of Gotham City. He even goes on the Rush Limbaugh (Link Rambeau) show and is played off as a fool. When a writer presents Limbaugh as a voice of reason you've gone a long way towards losing me. The story is played out in the DC universe where the solution to insanity is a punch in the face but the readers live in the real world. At one point a child like behemoth named Amygdala is crying out for his medicine and Batman responds with a quip and a double fist chop to the back of the neck. Mental problems cause people to lose their friends, their family, their jobs. Mental problems are not a super power. The Joker is presented as the king of the hill because he is the most insane. It doesn't work like that in the real world and vilifying people with mental problems is actually pretty low. I'm not one of those people that thinks that comics are a force of evil and I've been a lifelong fan but somehow Knightfall reached a tipping point for me where it suddenly dawned on me that ethically the story here might have some issues.<br /><br />But anyhoo, *ahem*. So how is the story? It's adequate. As far as I'm concerned the 90's are the low point of comics and Knightfall is fairly typical. I'm sure is was planned out as a big money maker and probably succeeded. The plot is fairly obvious and the art forgettable but I wont deny that the ending issue is pretty powerful. Like many of the earth shattering changes from the 90's (Evil Hal Jordan, Death of Superman) it was eventually wiped away and forgotten about but for a time it decently shook up the Batman world. If you're considering buying this because you enjoyed The Dark Knight Rises you're likely to be disappointed since the stories have almost nothing in common. I don't regret reading it but I'll probably stop with volume one and skip the next two. That probably expresses my feelings about this book as well as anything else I could say.ng people with mental problems is actually pretty low.

1611748755|1.0|I really don't understand what the appeal is of this book.  The book starts out with a REALLY long and preachy section that was mainly an opportunity for the author to lecture us about religion.  Then comes the boat adventure which is the heart of the book.  But even that part was botched imho.  For some inexplicable reason, the author chose write and write, and then just end it abruptly, seemingly lazily as if \\"eh, you get the picture, I won't bother telling you the rest...\\".  And then the ending is as bad as the beginning, extremely anti-climactic, and again another preachy section, telling us (of all things) about storytelling.<br /><br />This is easily one of the worst fiction books I've ever read.  And I just really don't understand what the appeal is of this book for so many people.
B0035LMTZA|5.0|Great Actors Cool Cars Great story very entertaining.<br />Never get tierd of watching this movie<br />Worth every penny Thank you
B00AHSIQWE|2.0|I am relieved to know that this will probably be the LAST batman movie to be filmed because it was HORRIBLE!
B00A0SKFLG|1.0|A lot of hype, good casting but the story line was not what I expected. It was certainly not worth my time watching it.
B000HT3PPG|5.0|This is my favorite version of Miracle on 34th Street.  I watch it from Thanks Giving on through the new year.
B002BCNK1Q|5.0|Once again brilliant acting by Clint Eastwood. The movie does have its surprises and addresses some of the issues we are facing in our society today.
B001KQZ7I8|5.0|I think this book should be required reading for everyone.  Some of my little desires are so petty..  this book has made me think more about life and what is really important..
B008L1DNGI|5.0|I played this game on the dreamcast and nintendo gameboy, I was thrilled when this was offered for free as the amazon daily deal.  If you like puzzle games, you will love this one.<br /><br />The basic idea is to guide space mice to the rocket(s) using direction arrows placed on the ground.  The mice go straight until they hit a wall and turn in a clockwise direction or follow corners.  In later levels, space cats are added and the idea is to guide the mice while avoiding the cats.
B007PVHMCG|3.0|This was a disappointing product. It cost over 100.00 and was very very little. No bang for buck. Tiny pieces hard to handle
B004EFYZ1C|4.0|I picked this up during the free app of the day and it's nice.  It's got lots of interesting scientific data about moon position and such, but I honestly don't see myself using this very much.  I'm sure a hobbyist astronomer would find this more interesting.
B008IJT0CE|5.0|I use this on my kindle every night, yhere are many plesant sounds to chose from and they also have set sound patterns for you to try, I've made and saved several sound combinations and I just LOVE this app.

B009MCRHH6|5.0|this game is so fun and very addicting! its also challenging. the sound effects and the graphics are entertaining! I can't remember if this was a free app or not, but its worth the download!
B004VMUS9G|3.0|This was a free app of the day, but I don't see myself using this very much.  I will never understand why app developers feel the need to have ads with something this simple.
B0083SBJXS|4.0|Last year I bought a copy of the \\"Salt\\" movie and loved it!  But try as I might, I was unable to access the 'extras.'  Only when I read a review here on Amazon.com did I find out the procedure.  Now...here I am again with \\"The Avengers\\" -- I love the movie, but am only able to access half of the listed \\"extras.\\"  Obviously, there's a flaw in my character. Meanwhile, I'll be grateful to anyone who can point me in the right direction here.
B005XQLBU4|5.0|A well done adaptation of Missile Command.  I like the twist in which you can upgrade weapons and rebuild your city.  The progression in difficulty is well done.
B00APUQRPC|5.0|I love clint Eastwood.  He is a  lovable cranky old man.  Great story line.  Always looking for a movie both my husband and I can enjoy and this was one of them.  Very entertaining.
B00AA0TJO8|4.0|This is an interesting game.  You follow the story of your stickman across a new land searching for his kidnapped friend.  You unravel the story as you solve puzzles and find secrets.  Well worth the investment and should provide many hours of entertainment.

B004O4K4SQ|5.0|This is a well done Space Invaders hybrid.  I like the weapon upgrade system, is a nice twist and reminiscent of Gradius.
B0047WJ12K|4.0|This movie was a bit hard to get into.  Once I figurered where it was going, it got better. Nothing more to say.<br /><br />ng, it got better
B007XKEY6Q|1.0|I got this app and I have had it for two days and now it doesn't work.  I tap on the icon and it sort of loads up but everything is black and then it returns to my home screen.  I tried to get it to work  for a couple days now but it does the same thing.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Not as good as catching fire but still a mind-boggling level of awesomeness. Suzanne Collins has done it again. Awesome
B004VMUS9G|5.0|I really depend on this ap. It's easy to use and can handle more appointments and wake up calls than my busy family needs. That's amazing. I especially like the multiple days feature as it saves time.

030759565X|5.0|I've enjoyed reading cookbooks since I was 12 and taught myself to bake using my mother's Betty Crocker Illustrated Cookbook.  I've been reading Deb's blog for several years now, and was so happy to hear she had published a book.<br /><br />The photographs are amazing, crisp and clean and not out of focus (like Pioneer Woman's). Like Deb, I have a tiny kitchen and I liked the peek into her kitchen. Deb is not a blogging juggernaut; she comes across as a good home cook who cooks so she can eat the food she likes.<br /><br />I have to eat a gluten free diet for health reasons and was pleased to see many of her recipes are either gluten free naturally or can be adapted easily; for instance, her Leek Fritters only call for 1/4 cup of all purpose flour, so substituting a neutral GF flour works perfectly here.  I made them the other night and was amazed at how a few simple ingredients made something so addictive.  The recipe was also easy to adapt to use different vegetables; I've made them since with cooked asparagus instead of leeks and they turned out wonderfully.  They were a tad salty to my taste, but this may have been a difference in salt, so I just dialed the salt down the next time I made them.<br /><br />So far in the sweets section I've only made the chocolate roll-out cookies, which were easy enough (though the dough was very stiff at first) and got a thumbs-up from my kids.  Looking forward to making the granola and the latkes and the lemon bars, just to name a few.<br /><br />Some people have commented that the layout of the book makes it awkward for cooking. I've noticed that is true on a few recipes, where the ingredients are on a righthand page and then the directions are on the page after that...this was an editing snafu, but is no reflection on the recipes themselves.  If anything it will encourage me to gather my ingredients first, as one should, and then proceed with the recipe.<br /><br />UPDATED 1/11/13--- I made the Whole Lemon Bars and at first was mildly disappointed; for having a whole lemon they didn't have a lemony, puckery \\"punch\\"--I thought perhaps too much butter, which muted the lemon.  They were delicious, just not quite as lemony as I thought they'd be.  But when my husband and sons tasted them they gave them RAVE reviews, my husband saying they had \\"just the right amount of lemon\\" and that more would have been overwhelming. My sons agreed with them.  I tend to like things very tart and sour, which most people don't, so I will not change anything when I make them again, and I will make them again--my husband said he has never liked a lemon bar before in his life, so Deb must be on to something! The recipe is so freaking easy, too--as long as you have a food processor you can do it all in that and never dirty a mixing bowl.  I also adapted them to be gluten free--using an equivalent amount of King Arthur Gluten Free Flour for the crust--and they came out perfectly.<br /><br />The granola was easy, and as promised, made large chunks of granola.  I did not have the coconut or walnuts, so used raw sunflower seeds instead. What a revelation that granola does NOT need tons of butter or oil or sugar to be delicious! And without having to stir it every ten minutes as in most recipes it was so much easier.
B005F3XV62|4.0|This was a gift for my daughter-in-laws father he had seen the movie before and laughed all the way through it
B008MEM24S|5.0|I love this game more and more! I love that it Just keeps adding more game the full version is best!
B007FY9ZWI|4.0|This little app works well for basic music playing.  I'm not a power user or anything; all I really want or need is an app that will play MP3 and MPEG format music files.  This fits the bill perfectly.  You can assemble and edit playlists.  It will present your files and sort by artist, song title, album title, etc.  Playback quality is great.  One neat feature is that it fades the music out smoothly when you get an incoming call.  Also, it will automatically pause playback when you use your phone's speech to text feature.  That's a neat little extra.  My only complaint is that this app will not play Windows Media (.wmv) format files.  That's the only thing I can think of that would make this app perfect.  Bottom line, get it.
B008YWY0HK|5.0|We love this movie and there wasn't a problem at all with the dvd format and our tv. Love it!
B008AK8FHM|4.0|Believable - a subject that most of us would like to know more about.  Would have liked a little more specifics.
B0045NXMJE|4.0|... And it was made even better by the fact that I didn't have to wait to get it in the mail! It came so quickly and in great condition. Thanks!
B00846F1YW|5.0|I really liked this game as I have liked all the games from your company..very creative and challenging.  I certainly would recommend this to others.  Hours of fun..  Connie from Ohio
B006O6F932|5.0|The makers of this toy were sure thinking of us parents.  It folds up perfectly for when it isn't being played with.  We could not beat the price anywhere locally.  Quick and smooth transaction and delivery.
B000KJT8IG|5.0|Hey! If any of you are looking for any last-minute gift ideas for anyone, give them this.<br />Tis the season to be merry.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|An mind assaulting, Post-Apocalyptic view of cruelty and resistance. If you plan on seeing the movie, read this BEFORE seeing the movie. You will have a better understanding of Katniss and her thought process.
B008220C38|4.0|The trailer for this movie is pretty stunning. (As was the trailer for 'immortal beloved')<br />**The actual movie is...well, kind of patchy:<br />When it is being stunning, it excels.<br />However, there are some very tedious passages:<br />A dance that goes on longer than is necessary to give us the idea that 'time stood still' i suppose?<br />A vapid Vronsky.<br />An embarassingly melodramatic 'i'm going to die soon' scene for Anna.<br />No chemistry between Anna and her son....shown sitting in some kind of picture frame at one inexplicable moment.<br />Jude Law is adorable as the poor confused, sad, loving husband.<br />Steva is a lovable rascal in this portrayal, the only really vigorous presence here.<br /> Kitty and Levin offer some real warmth, and the Indian companion of Levin's brother was memorable.<br /><br />*****Fabulous eye-candy. A certain kinship with cirque du soleil, a precocious circus of a production.<br />No depth.
B0083ZRAJS|5.0|Bring a fan of the movie, I couldn't resist reading the book. The book is darker then the movie but a must read for a fan of the classic movie.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|This app is really useful,the keys are large and easy to read and it being free is a bonus. I would definitely recommend it.
B007FEZQF8|5.0|As a fan of the show, the graphic novel gives another aspect of the world. The TV show doesn't follow the books so they are definitely great to read.
B005NFJAZS|5.0|I got this DVD for my 87 year old dad. He loves musicals. We just watched this on his VCR at Thanksgiving!!! I had to hurry and get this DVD so I wouldn't have to see that VHS tape again.
B00AESN8XY|5.0|LOVE LOVE LOVE IT!! This is a great game and you will learn about infectious organisms, geography, and climate while playing.
B0065GC0BA|5.0|Very interesting story line which kept you reading, wondering about the outcome of events. Caused me to do some further research through Google.Factual content. I have since read a further book by Jojo Moyes.
B0086700CM|5.0|You should get this app it lets you change people and is really fun very addicting but after a while gets boring
B001KDQ4KQ|2.0|Very American in content and values. This did not appeal to me.I found the plot and characters unrealistic.Not my cup of tea.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|If you have ever played temple run you will love this app its like temple run but you can log in to facebook and see when you beat your friends high scores while your running Get it now because people who create  apps like this always come to their scenes and start charging money so get it while its free
B005PZ85SO|5.0|One of the best shows out there!  Love it!  I've already almost finished watching this season and look forward to buying the next!
B008CLI4N4|4.0|Seems to be following the book reasonably well at least enough to make watching the shows enjoyable.  Some of the actors do not match my vision of them especially Daenerys and Tyrion (although the actor is very good) but I am adjusting...Jon Snow, not sure what my expectation was but he is growing on me.  The books are so huge & complex, it is amazing that they can put them into a TV format.  Over all, I am glad to have the CD's since I don't have HBO.
B006M7JCC2|5.0|Fantastic read, unbelievable but true story.<br />This book was very close to my heart, because my Husband died of cancer.<br />I loved it.<br /><br />Johanna Verberne.
B004DM0UII|5.0|This radio  is really great in listening lots of great choice from around the world. Easily going from one station to another with just a click of a stroke. From old favorites to up to the minute hits not only here in the US but all over the world.
B004XNGKBS|5.0|Great way of taking notes and anything else. Everyone needs to get it. This is good app for business and personal world.
B00AB0AR2U|2.0|Having thoroughly enjoyed the previous Resident Evil movies, I was on the verge of almost being somewhat saddened that this one did not live up to my expectations.  As a continuation of the franchise, I would encourage everyone who is a fan of umbrella corporation or of Ms. Jovovich to watch this just to get the perspective of the entire production.  But if you haven't invested in the previous story, don't bother starting with this one.
B0053O89WY|5.0|Got this at a great price! I can watch it at home or away from home on my laptop or any time I want this way.
B0063IH60K|4.0|I love how the cards &quot;dance&quot; when you win a game. Graphics are nice and crisp... 0:)<br />Definitely a keeper.
B009O07NDY|4.0|it has more than just 2 pieces of CD, not to mention the music is great for those who like Hobbit!
B004DM0UII|5.0|Interface is a little in the bland side, but the extreme usability and nearly no buffering makes this a keeper for me. Very straightforward workings and really nothing speak ill of.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|Follett has done it again. Hundreds of reviews have been written about Book Two so I will not dither on about what a genius is Ken Follett. Suffice it to say that the saga of  the families in Book One is masterfully continued. We love the courage, the humanity. I look forward to the completion of the trilogy.
B009IEXKXI|5.0|I was dubious about this book being in a diary kind of format. Well, was I in for a surprise, I could not put this book down, and enjoyed every page.  Some of the technical stuff was a bit beyond me, but easy enough to read.  At work when things go wrong, I ask &#34;what would Watney do.&#34;<br /><br />A truly magnificent read, great job by the author.
B007MDB548|4.0|Got the video in-time to watch with our grandaughter fo our visit,  we enjoyed the movie and all had a great time
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|Jessica Lang is outstanding<br />The doctor is creepy<br />Sister Mary Eunice is amazing<br />A great cast portraying a creepy dark plot
B00ACBN9CI|4.0|I liked the game. It does not handle as well as I would hope, but it might just be the Kindle Fire HD.<br /><br />The game is interesting, fun enough to play a few times and enjoyable.<br /><br />You do have to pay for continuing to play it once you complete the first phase - which I won't be doing. I might have bought the full version of the game, but the demo just not handle (the flying quality) as well as I would hope for for a paid game.<br /><br />The free part of it is enjoyable.
B005S9EK1S|5.0|Read the book, saw the movie in theaters, had to have it on blu-ray! Don't like zac efron at all but he did a really good job in this one. None of the cocky boy here! Was true to the book and what an awesome love story!
B0058YPLA2|5.0|I have been following this show from the start, and I am truly enchanted! I admit, I thought it was a bit cheesy in the first few episodes, but I kept with it and am so glad I did. The characters are truly well developed and the storylines are mixed perfectly. There is plenty of magic, mystery and romance to go around!<br /><br />It is very uplifting with some great lessons (having faith in those you love, staying true to yourself, believing good will always win...) however, it does NOT shy from darker themes at all. Lives are lost, battles fought, domestic troubles, treachery, its all in there, too!<br /><br />You will cry, and cheer for certain characters who may not be completely \\"bad.\\" This show really develops the characters, in both worlds (I also love that concept - we get to see them in fairy tale land, and the real world! Brilliant!) The scenary and costumes are also done fabulously.<br /><br />I do not watch much TV these days, I don't even have cable, but I look forward to this show EVERY week!<br /><br />If you watch, then surely you will believe that true love is the most powerful magic of all!
B006LSZECO|5.0|Dark and twisted, just the way I like it. Keeps you guessing until the VERY end. Loved it and can't wait to read her other 2 books. Yay for Gillian Flynn and her dark dark mind!
B008TRUDAS|3.0|This storyline is so similar to Aria and Ezras situation on pretty little liars.. if you have seen the show, don't bother reading slammed..
034580404X|5.0|Bought this trilogy for a great price. Box keeps books protected and organized. Easily sharable by just giving your friends the box! Loved the story and can't wait for the movie!
B004DM0UII|1.0|My Kindle Fire refused to load the file saying that the file was corrupteed. From other reiews I have seen, I am not the only one this happened to. I would give a zero rating vbut there is none.
B000Q67876|5.0|is the highest rated film on IMDB. It's a true classic. It's one of the films many wish they saw it at the theatre. I don't have that regret. I saw it at the theatre because it was a Stephen King classic novella.
1401235417|5.0|The story has a great depth and it gives us new enemies that only adds to the batman long history.
B001AQT0RC|4.0|I don't know why it bothers others. Jodie Foster is wonderful as her character is given the gift of faith at the end.
B002Q9VPFM|5.0|Alot of people do not appreciate this movie for what it is. A great retelling of the greatest comic story ever written. People believe unless it is word for word translated from book to screen it is a bastardization of the original. I disagree. Zack Snyder rewrote it to suit our times. (And all he really did was rewrite the ending). I proudly hold this as one of the BEST comic book movies ever made. And any collector would be proud to own this addition in their collection.
B002DMJLTE|5.0|Not counting Titanic which is more of a historical drama. This film has the classic disaster movie format with an ensemble cast with intertwinning story line. It's heartbreaking drama and told the way it would most likely happen.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|Love love love the Hunger Games series.  Can't wait to read another book by Suzanne Collins<br />Great series for teenage readers
B005NFJAMG|4.0|3.99 is a good value for this movie which is a very good film and is represented on blu ray quite well.
B00AA7O22U|4.0|I like it because of the Good O' Fashion Action Film where the family can enjoy. Just the good guys vs the bad guys.
B0053O89RY|5.0|love modern family.  cannot wait to get a new one.  It is great to watch with the family or alone
B000W93CHC|5.0|Pillars of the Earth was an amazing story. Ken Follett's tells the story that makes the reader actually feel that he/she is right there with the characters living it through the pages of the book.  I started reading World w/o End recently and have read about10% of the book so far. I have already decided that this book will be as good as the Pillar of the Earth book and cannot wait for the movie (or mini-series) to come out.
B009VB97EY|1.0|Eek....I thought this would be a fun movie.  The trailer was a lot more interesting than the actual movie.  Truthfully I was bored throught the whole movie.
B009O07NDY|2.0|1. This is not the full and complete soundtrack from the film. Some songs included in this album either sound completely different or are not in the movie at all. For example, \\"Radagast the Brown\\" theme has a boys' quire in it, yet in the movie it does not. Even though I personally prefer the boys' quire version, it bothers me a little because it shows that something was either unorganized or simply not taken care of.<br /><br />My most biggest complainant on this matter have to do with soundtracks \\"Out of the Frying Pan\\" and \\"A Good Omen\\". These soundtracks are completely different than in the movie. The \\"Eagles Theme\\" that was in the movie is by far the most beautiful musical composition I've heard, yet it is replaced with \\"A Good Omen\\" for the soundtrack, which is far less beautiful. What a shameless decision.<br /><br />\\"Out of the Frying-Pan\\" piece has a quire singing to Thorin going for a battle with Azog. Yet in the movie a Nazgul theme is used for that moment. Which makes absolutely no sense and strips the \\"Out of the Frying-Pan\\" off its validity. Perhaps it was decided that they weren't good enough for the movie? Well then, might as well not include these two soundtracks in the album if that's the case...<br /><br />2. Some soundtracks are almost identical to the ones in \\"The Lord of the Rings\\" trilogy. \\"Old Friends\\" theme sounds almost exactly like the \\"Very Old Friends\\" theme from the extended version of \\"Fellowship of the Ring\\" soundtrack. \\"The Hidden Valley\\" is a clone of \\"Many Meetings\\" from \\"Fellowship of the Ring\\".<br /><br />This is quiet disappointing for several reasons. The events that took place in \\"The Hobbit\\" are 60 years earlier than in \\"The Lord of the Rings\\". Many things were much different, therefore Hobbiton could have been more deserving of a broader musical selection. May be a few happier and more cheerful tunes; a different selection of flutes, strings and drums! There could be a totally different theme altogether, considering Frodo was not yet in the picture and Bilbo himself was much younger. Middle Earth was not yet afflicted by the darkness of Sauron either.<br /><br />But my biggest disappointment was the \\"Rivendel\\" theme. The elves are a serious race, we get it! But do they really lack creativity this much as to sing the same ol' song for hundreds of years? Could they not have had something diverse in their musical library 60+ years prior to the \\"Many Meetings\\" event?<br /><br />I honestly expected Howard Shore to expand the musical world of the Elves and the Hobbits in this film, but instead he proved to be lazy and simply copied and pasted a lot of the material from \\"The Lord of the Rings\\" trilogy.<br /><br />3. The new themes of Dwarves and Erebor are beautiful, but Howard Shore once again ruthlessly cuts them all right at the moments of climax. For example, \\"Over Hill\\" soundtrack starts out the Dwarven theme very slowly, then picks up and right when it finally starts playing it out in its glory, instead of giving us a longer listen to enjoy, Howard Shore quickly blends it into a disastrous ending.<br /><br />If he was so eager to offer us an extended soundtrack, the best thing would have been to extend those beautiful pieces that were cut off to prematurely in the movie. Instead pretty much all of the extensions he added to soundtracks, happen to be completely useless. In fact those soundtracks are better off without the boring extensions.<br /><br />There are about 7 absolutely amazing soundtracks. Most of which are added as bonuses (ironically). For these, I give this album 2 full stars! I hope Howard Shore will create something new and fresh for the next two upcoming movies however!s not yet in the picture and Bilbo himself was much younger.

B0070Y46UY|2.0|I purchased this book because my son mentioned it.  I really didn't enjoy it, probably because I don't care for fantasy.
B004GGQMRY|5.0|its a great movie and a fantastic performance by Dustin and even Tom isnt too bad in this one.  watch it again,
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I chose it because everyone was talking about it.  I must admit, I was skeptical.  However, it's a beautiful love story and Christian Gray works through a lot of childhood trauma with the help of Anna.  It is a woman's fantasy, not sure a man would enjoy it.  I also love the drama and mystery that occurred.
B007ZGBZHE|5.0|Yet again the guys have written another fascinating story with the beloved Pendergast solving mysteries that leave most detectives just wandering around blindling,  this story is most interesting in its background and a lot disturbing in its potential nature

B0098VXE50|4.0|I enjoyed this movie in theaters and watching it again at home.  The storyline is great and Charlize Theron is captivating in her role.
B00APUQPX6|5.0|This was a very enjoyable movie!  It shows the strength of family and friends and sticking together.  It also has some fun songs that will entertain both adults and children.  Highly recommend!
B004EPZ0AC|5.0|I saw this movie in the theaters and had to add to my movie collection.  My son and I enjoyed it, and it still makes me laugh when I watch it.
B005CA4SQK|4.0|This special edition of the Walking Dead is a must have for any zombie fan, but it have something that i don't like and is that for spanish speakers, the episodes have subtitles, but the special features don't have, still you can enjoy them.<br /><br />Español: Esta edición especial de The Walking Dead es una necesidad para cualquier fan de zombies, pero tiene algo que no me gusta y es que para los hablantes de español, los episodios tienen subtítulos, pero no las características especiales, aun asi se puede disfrutar de ellos.<br /><br />avisados quedan.

B003TJR2HS|5.0|Works perfectly to allow us to use an iPhone 4s in a docking speaker system without removing the phone from it's Otterbox case. Not much else to say.
B00A0SLTCU|3.0|Like most remakes, the original was better. Special effects were very good. The problem was that there wasn't enough story to support the special effects.
B0086213XW|5.0|The film is not a formulaic romantic comedy. It's an insightful relationship tone piece, with an excellent performance by Michelle Williams.
B001C4AFOY|5.0|This is one of our family favorites. It is well done and the characters are well developed. The only thing I think that could be improved is the font size of the words on the screen. They are too small to see and you have to see them to get the full affect of the story. But we loved the movie, bought several to use as gifts
B009OA57MI|5.0|Enjoyable with tons of combat and training scenarios. Used on my transformer tf700 infinity pad tablet. Lots of challenging scenarios.
B009MCRHH6|5.0|I love proposal games and this will keep you entertained it is a must have I bought it Without knowing what it was and now I'm addicted to it it is fun With hours of entertainment and challenges.
B00A9C3RB8|2.0|So if you're in the micro demographic that might be interested in seeing two sixty-somethings go for marriage counseling, you might hope for some charm and humor from the two great actors, but even they can't save the poor writing. Absolutely no narrative trajectory, no insight into why either of them behaves as they do and even less explanation of what brings about the final happy ending.You're left feeling like too much ended up on the cutting room floor.<br /><br />And I just couldn't get used to Steve Carell in a serious role. He's fine, but you keep waiting for the zinger that never comes. A few jokes would have been an improvement.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is so fun.I like just started to play and I already have a bunch of coins.I like it so much I play it every day.If it is my dads phone or my kindle I will play it.
B00973902K|5.0|Ok,not much to say about a MP3 file..It was easy to download,and was automatically sent to WMP,making it super easy to put on my device.<br />The music sonds good,uncut and not a remix.
B000O8OTNC|5.0|I bought this for my bug out bag, it is compact and light weight, easy to hold and keep your digits out of the way, and has a carbide and ceramic sharpener, as well as a diamond sharpener for serrated blades.  Love it.
B006OOHYIC|5.0|Worth every penny. This game is like electricity crack, all the fun and pleasure none of the tooth loss. Buy it but beware.
B001N1DPDE|5.0|You cannot find a better knife for the price in my opinion.  Plain and simple.  Full tang, Heavy duty, flat top, which is great for batoning wood, flat butt for pounding, should you need it, and just plain good all around knife.  The sheath leaves you wanting, because of it's fabric belt loop, and crappy snap, but I just cut that part off and mounted A Tek-Loc ($8) which alleviated this issue completely, and actually allows me to configure the knife in either scout or upright positions (The Tek-Lok needs to be installed one way or the other, and does not go back and forth between the two).  Even without the the snap, the sheath holds the knife very securely.  Although I should give the actual knife 4/5 stars because the belt loop really is bad, because the Tek-Lok fixes this completely and you end up with a quality survival knife at a fraction of the cost of the competitors I still gave it 5 Stars.  You could expect to pay upwards of a hundred dollars for a knife of this quality.  At just under $65 for the knife and the Tek-Lok, I would highly recommend this knife to anyone, even with the sheaths shortcomings.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Wonderful series. Very elegantly written that had me both in tears and smiling erratically. I would highly recommend this book.
B008MEM24S|5.0|This is a great app. It makes you use your mind to puzzle solve. It's great for my kids (they love it!), but it stretches my mind too. The puzzles vary from easy to difficult, so it gives you a nice range of difficulty.
B004J64QSI|5.0|Finest production of Les Mis.  Singing is outstanding and the bonus at the end is worth the purchase of the DVD.
B006GWO5NE|5.0|The adapter helps to keep my husband happy and using his Kindle almost all day every day when he is off from work.
B0034G4OYA|4.0|great movie I liked it a lot. Nothing like a good animation to enjoy with the entire family. my kids thought this is a really funny movie and we had such a fun afternoon watching it
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I love this game.  Challenging and fun, I could play it all day, but I might go blind!  Even my three year old son loves it.
B002KH4DBI|1.0|Story line almost made up for how bad this show was.  We wasted our time and money on watching this one.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|It is visually appealing, easy to learn and fun!<br />AND no ads yet to hassle with..I like that :)<br />Caution it can be addictive.
B0076DCT2G|5.0|Nelson DeMille always does a good story, and this one doesn't let you down.  John Corey is one of his greatest inventions and keeps you smiling no matter what is going on in the story  This story was a good one.
B007IXWL2C|3.0|Had to rate it only three stars just because I would have rather have bought the book itself.  It is just not the same reading it electronically.  Also, this one leaves you wanting more in a whole new way.
B007H1HQW0|5.0|I watched a You Tube video of someone using this.  I thought that it looked too easy.  My first bottle turned out perfect.  I had 2 break out of 10.  Not bad for a first time.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|This book had me reeling for more the whole way through.  I do not read at all and could not put this book down.  You simply must read it.
B007RTAR64|5.0|Purchased for my daughter as a gift.  She really loved getting it and has commented on how realistic it is.  I'd recommend to anyone.
B007IXWKUK|3.0|Had to rate only three stars because I like to actually flip the pages and snuggle with a great book like this one.  Will have to go buy the paper version.  This book is great and has a really good cliff hanger in it.
B000V86OKG|5.0|I loved the show &#34;Dexter&#34; sfter I got past the first one.  I wanted my son to see it, and then sent it to my daughter, I didn't look a t it myself, since I saw the show on T V
B00AWTTUHI|4.0|While I didn't like it as much as Part 1, I still consider this another huge victory for DC Animation.<br /><br />It's a great adaptation of the comic.<br />There was a well-told story about morality and authority.<br />The animation was great with a lot of attention to detail in the action sequences.<br />And the pacing was just perfect.  I was constantly engaged.<br /><br />The only downside is a matter of preference.  The reason I preferred Part 1 is because there was less \\"out there\\" stuff going on.  I tend to like my Batman stories more grounded in reality and not flying gas dolls and men of steel.<br />I also find it odd that The Joker can almost kill Batman, but Superman doesn't even come close.<br /><br />All in all a must watch.  A real return to form lately after the horrible \\"Year One\\" and \\"All Star Superman\\".
031606792X|5.0|I didn't reaad this book.  It was all the thing for teenagers at that time .  I bought it for my granddaughter, and all the others in the series
B007ZXK08C|5.0|A very clever novel. Parallel narratives of a twisted marriage that tie together in an amazing conclusion.<br />Well worth a read.
0345803493|3.0|Loved the first book and had to buy Fifty Shades Darker. Started out enjoying this book but then thought it got a little boring towards the end.  Don't think I need to read the third.  Tired of reading the same adventures over and over.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|As alway's this was a very good read. It has lot's of twist and will keep you up reading all night.The only bad part was the ending, I thought it could have a better .ending. but as always it was  Grisham at his best.
B009ZZDNT6|4.0|It's great and everything, it plays the alarms no matter what, (unless of course your device is powered down), but I just wish the free version would let you play more sounds then just the white noise. Otherwise this app is great. I recommend it for the kindle fire.
B002UOMGVU|4.0|This movie is a classic as alway's the acting by all in this movie was perfect.This movie accurately depicts \\"a slice of life.\\" and furthermore shows what can be perceived \\"glamorous\\" to some Italian Americans that like this lifestyle. Having lived and worked in New York City for 23 years. Excellently done and portrayed.
B004DLPXAO|2.0|I was looking for a good program that would play audio books.  I travel quite a bit and have enjoyed audio books in CD and cassettes.  Was disappointed that there are not any good free audio player for Nexus 7, Android.
B004RUF9DC|4.0|Wonderful; Excellent Blue Ray and totally sweeping and awesome rendition of our Savior. Wonderful Actor in Max Van Sydow. A masterpiece for any library.
B005CA4SQK|5.0|My daughter & I are fans of this show and can't wait for the new season of the walkning dead.
B002MFV2IK|5.0|Death Becomes Her is an oldie but a goodie. Even my 9 year old grandson loved it. I would say this one stands the test of time but I would love to see it remade.
B004VSTP4Y|5.0|These books surprised me I was not sure I would like them, but I did, I loved the whole series I wish they never ended
B00001ZULV|4.0|For the price I was not disappointed in this collection. I purchased my CD used so I purchased additional CD's with the titles I wanted.
B0099G3I96|5.0|No Doubt was one of my favorite. Now almost 30, I was in my first year of college when they called it quits. It is great to have them back, but Gwen's new life experiences and time being solo have given her something else to write about.
B005LAIH4A|5.0|This is a cute movie with a good story/meaning behind it.  I watched it with my 3.5 year old son and he really enjoyed it.
B005EGXTHG|5.0|Fantastic storyline to follow up from The Hunger Games. Couldn't get through it quick enough. Can't wait for the release of this movie this year.
B008FRFN7A|5.0|Now I can print directly from my droid instead of copy and email and open and print from my PC

086571701X|4.0|Like book have lots of info using it now to grow fish and vegetables.  Like because it talks you through how it works and how to set up.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|This book is by far amazing. An incredible story of courage and true love! It's a must read.<br />I think Katie is truly inspiring!
B00APUYWYA|5.0|This movie was hysterical, the acting wasn't bad at all....it can be seen as a bit ridiculous as times, but it's definitely funny. Highly recommended.
B003XT603Q|5.0|Going through a tough time on my own, I needed an escape - a healthy escape. I've felt near Death and as if it were really apart of life.<br /><br />In regards to the novel itself, I felt that I could relate to all characters in some tiny way. I guess that's what drew me closer to this book... the distant yet familiar feeling I got from this book. This is, by far, one of the best novels I have read in my young adult life and I highly suggest it to anyone looking for not just entertainment, but to find some sort of understanding within themselves.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|i am So excited about the new season!! i can't wait to see what shirley mcclain brings to the show!!!
B003TSEEDY|5.0|This book is a great read and one that really hit home for me.everyone should read this book.I totally recommend it

B005S9EK5Y|5.0|I don't often review films, but after seeing Les Mis&eacute;rables on the big screen a couple of days ago, I wanted to express my thoughts. The film is a cinematic tour de force of Victor Hugo's classic nineteenth century novel, but based much more closely on the musical drama that was first produced onstage in 1985. My tattered old Signet Classic paperback is almost 1,500 pages. The film is just over 2½ hours, so there were a lot of details and subplots that were cut from the book, but in the end, the filmmakers did a nice job of preserving the essence of the story.<br /><br />A couple of weeks before seeing the movie, my wife and I saw a short &#34;making of&#34; feature about the movie. The really fascinating detail of the movie was that director Tom Hooper chose the most unusual method of recording vocals live on the set instead of the traditional method of pre-recording the vocals in a studio months in advance. Both Hooper and the actors believed that this choice of production method would make the film feel much more emotional, raw, and real. In my opinion, their approach was very successful.<br /><br />That was one big difference between Les Mis&eacute;rables and virtually every other film version of a stage musical. The other big difference was that there was almost no dialogue - every utterance by the actors was in song, making the movie come across more like grand opera than the traditional American and British musical format. And the actors delivered in a big way. I knew that Hugh Jackman and Anne Hathaway could sing, but who knew that Russell Crowe could?<br /><br />The bottom line: A great story translated into a great musical film, with one of the finest performances in years from Ms. Hathaway in her rendition of &#34;I Dreamed a Dream,&#34; a mournful lament, sung by the anguished and impoverished Fantine, who reminisced about happier times and wondered at all that has gone wrong in her life. It's a beautiful song that wrings a lot of emotion from the audience. By the way, the song that Anne Hathaway sings in the trailer for Les Mis&eacute;rables is not the same version that she sings in the movie. The trailer version sounds more like a concert performance taken out of context from the story, and it's only about 1:20 long. The movie version is 4:38 and really delivers the full power and pathos of the song.By the way, the song that Anne Hathaway sings in the trailer for Les Misérables is not the same version that she sings in the movie.

B003JTHXOK|5.0|It was unlike most Nicholas Sparks books I have read, it was cruel and romantic and suspenseful. It had a marvelous twist.
1594487154|4.0|I love Pink. My first adventure with him was \\"Drive: The Surprising Truth About What Motivates Us.\\" \\"Drive\\" drove me to \\"A Whole New Mind\\" and somewhere along that road I discovered \\"Johnny Bunko.\\" \\"Drive\\" and \\"A Whole New Mind\\" were spectacular; \\"Bunko\\" was different. Ridiculously poor puns/analogies aside, I waited anxiously for \\"To Sell Is Human.\\"<br /><br />\\"To Sell Is Human\\" is a good read. I'd probably rank it third behind \\"Drive\\" and \\"A Whole New Mind,\\" but that's coming from a Pink reader and my expectations are probably way, way unreasonable. Too, that's like placing third behind Man o' War and Secretariat.<br /><br />I've been training sales and working in sales all my life, but haven't ever sold anything except air when I sell a feel good heart for a donation to support a not-for-profit I may be working with. So when Dan divided the selling population up into the 1 in 9 who actually sell and the other 8 who support and sell through non-selling I was right there in his thinking.<br /><br />Pink is engaging, easy to read and his ideas are very scientifically supported and oddly revolutionary. I cannot tell you how many times I've referenced his work in stuff I do, but \\"a lot\\" is probably an understatement. I'll add \\"To Sell Is Human\\" to that list. I put all three of his books in any library and I'd throw in \\"Johnny Bunko\\" just to show we can all be different.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|This was one of the most amazing books I have ever read in my whole entire life and I am only 13.
B0086700CM|5.0|Temple run is the best trilogy game ever. Its popularity is 90%. You have to use critical/quick thinking and agility, while dealing with booby traps. It seems difficult at the first time,but the more you practice the better you succeed.
B009KHCT94|4.0|This movie is total camp... It's a blend of all kinds of sci fi memes, mostly from the 80s and 90s with a fantastic tie-in to the 00s. Don't expect it to be Star Wars (or even Space Balls for that matter). But a fun watch anyway.
B004XJRQUQ|4.0|This could be one of the scenarios to be played by the way we often seem to relate to those in other places and in other groups, some time in the future.  The end of the trilogy does not hold up to the story line that precedes it, but as a whole it does hold the interest of the reader, although dealing mostly with adolescents under extreme stress.
B005OCFGTO|4.0|When I first saw they had a DVD collection of all 8 films of the Harry Potter Franchise I instantly jump to buy this set. It may not have a lot of special features but I figured it wouldn't since all 8 films are in this collection. Hours before I bought this I went to Target and saw they had this exact same item for $75. I was glad I bought this because it saved me a lot of money. Overall this is a great DVD collection of the Harry Potter movies.
B004QOB8SO|5.0|A relief to have to move rapidly through the stories as if they were actually happening in real time. This second set was as great as the first.
B00APUYWYA|2.0|The characters were too old for college students.also each was a polished singer who knew all of the lyrics to many songs.one would begin and the others would chime in tune and on key.THE MAIN CHARACTER i FELT HAD FEW IF ANY THINGS TO LIKE ABOUT HER.HER SUDDEN REALIZATION THAT SHE PUSHED PEOPLE AWAY RANG FALSE.
0307155102|4.0|This was my first purchase of this book, but I know I love some of his other books and figured this one had to be great, too.
0446554995|5.0|[[ASIN:0446554995 Two Graves (Pendergast)]]Twists and turns, but somewhat predictable in parts. I got this book for Christmas, as it was on my Amazon Wish List. I've read all of the Pendergast books (as I call them). I love the characters and the way they have been developed. I haven't finished this book yet, so I'm hoping the character will live on in more books. I can't imagine my life without Agent Pendergast and since I buy the books, it will never be.
B007NZDES0|4.0|Its good to see you again Sade, the time was no pass  for you !!!<br />Nice Concert and excelente like always your voice and perfomance !!
B000002J5K|5.0|I really love the soundtrack for this movie. I love all kinds of music, except rap, which I don't really consider music at all.  Anyway, [[ASIN:B000002J5K The Blues Brothers: Original Soundtrack Recording]] really touches my soul and takes me back. Plus all of the great stars on the soundtrack, immortalized. It's great.
B008HK3XU4|5.0|I got him purple so he wouldn't lose it and so far it has worked.  It's easy to hold and sets up easily.  Sits level and secure. Very satisfied with this purchase and will get another with the next Kindle!
B009CVILU4|5.0|This is such a great world created by George.  I feel I can call him George because after spending so much time with him, we have to be on a first name basis.  I have my Kindle and have just ordered a new Fire.  I still love to read real books.  This world is so real it is necessary to keep grounded in the maps.  The map in the this book is wonderful and very helpful!!!!  Love Westeros.....
B00APUYN0I|5.0|If for no other reason watch it to see the commentators - the things that come out of their mouths are hysterical!  If they could really say things like that I'd be a huge sports fan!  Music is really great, story is typical, but we just loved it.  We actually watched it twice during our rental period.  It's funny, don't pass it up.
B000FC1LOC|4.0|Just to forewarn you, the ending of the book is different than the ending of the movie.  I saw the movie first and didn't realize the ending was different from the book.  But I still liked both the movie and the book.
B002MYUEWQ|5.0|I have loved this movie since I was a kid and now it's become a holiday must in my household.  We make a special movie night and all get together and watch it!
B008673ZAQ|5.0|If you like the Grey trilogy you will LOVE the Crossfire series!  From the minute you open the book it draws you in and takes you on ride that you don't ever want to end!
B00A9X9ORI|2.0|This is just our family's collective opinion but it was an hour+ that we'll never get back. :(  The trailer looked promising but at the end we were wondering why we had bothered.  My dad said he was glad we saw it because he had planned to buy it and now new better.  You might like it, just not us.  Sorry.
B006RXQ3GO|5.0|Loved this movie the first time I saw it and was glad to share it with a next generation of romantics :)
B000SVZIDA|5.0|Totally hypnotic and aesthetically pleasing beyond words. The textural combination of beauty, story and song--make this a true masterpiece. If you haven't seen it yet, you should.

B004SIP8W0|5.0|Excellent WWII story about a father trying to save his family in the Nazi camps with a sense of humor.
B005GFPZYK|4.0|A great insight in to the depth of patriotism driving dedicated US military professionals. Well written with no holds barred in relation to  mamby-pamby anti-conflict liberals.<br />Nice touch with contributions from a military wife's perspective.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Best game ever.Its a game where you dash onto trains that are sometimes moving. You collect coins and you can use the coins to buy characters or buy things that will help you get ahead of the people trying to catch you. The person trying to catch you has a dog and at during Christmas time, the person is Santa and the dog is mean but dresses up like Rudolf. I like that all the boys in my class know about this game and we can all play against each other. Its fun because you can unlock new characters and buy new characters. It's a great game!
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I'm excited to read book 3.  I'm a hopeless romantic myself.  Although I do recommend keeping an open mind whole reading these books.  On to book 3.

B0053O89KG|5.0|I purchased this item as a Christmas gift for my wife.  She is a true Castle fan (and so is our daughter).  They both love it and are certain to recommend it to anyone considering purchasing a copy.  I will admit to liking it as well.  Handy to not have any commercials in the segments!
B0086700CM|5.0|I love this game. it is fun. love it.  Cant wait to play again so fun :) next level hear I come :)
B008TRUDAS|5.0|I'm so glad I decided to read Slammed.  The characters were great and it was wonderful watching thier love blossom.  I loved the unexpected event right at the beginning that set the whole story.  Will is a strong character and tries to have the best morals which I adore.  Lake is still young but tries to be mature and together they can overcome anything!!!  I love this book and it made it to my top ten.
B00993FEUK|5.0|great experience. Arrived before christmas and was exactly what I expected. Really enjoyed the movie on our new blue ray player.
B00005JM02|3.0|I had a hard time finding just a DVD. Didn't need bluray but bought this anyway. Maybe someday it'll be used; maybe not. The movie itself was a gift nd they loved it.
B007FJFDXS|4.0|The only gripe I have is that I'm not as entertained when I have to watch 30 seconds of animation every time I replay a level because thats how the level sets up.<br /><br />Really nice game mechanics and cool graphics make for an entertaining puzzler.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I just finished this last night... Love Love Loved it!  I really liked Slammed and Point of Retreat and knew I was in for a treat!
B00APUQPX6|4.0|I would have given it 5 stars but the movie content seemed to scare my 3yr old at times. The ape character was the most likely culprit. Overall, it is a good film.
B00A77II0U|3.0|good app but too easy should be one dolllar instead of 3 grrrrr it does not always have clear instructions I have mixed feelings
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|No complaints.  Better than my regular calculator.  Ads are innocuous and don't distract at all.  Truly is an essential kindle app
0345803493|5.0|The book was in great condition and an excellent read. I'd  recommend the book to anyone who enjoys harlequin romance novels for its graphic content or anyone who enjoys the development of complicated character bonds.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I couldn't believe how intoxicating this story was.  A true love story.  I can't wait to read the second book.  I was surprised how I cried at the end.
B004J4WN0I|5.0|Not usually into this genre but really glad I gave this a chance.  Great story and laughs. Can't wait to read the next in the series. Highly recommended.
B000ICXQHE|4.0|Well acted characters in the roles that they inhabit frequently and comfortably. Not breaking any new ground but skillfully executed.
B000FCKGPC|3.0|I didn't enjoy this installment as well as the first three books. There are too many new characters introduced and too many old ones that aren't mentioned at all.
6305428042|5.0|Our kids have always loved this movie. We saw it on TV again this year and decided to buy it. It arrived sooner than expected and our kids were glad to have it for Halloween.
B008QTVNUI|5.0|Got hooked watching this while visiting out of town & I enjoyed it so much that I had to buy it online since I wasn't then a Showtime subscriber. Cost online of $18.95 very reasonable vs purchasing CD for $32. I wanted to see Season 2 in real time so I've since signed up for Showtime.
B006R1T40I|4.0|I LOVE THIS CD. IT IS JUST HAS A VERY COOL VIBE. SOME SONGS JUST ROCK. SHE STILL HAS THE BONNIE SENSITIVE LOVE SONGS.GET IT!!
B004LOMB2Q|4.0|extremely userfriendly app, great for college students, can also be downloaded on laptop and all notes taken with evernote can be accessed with smartphone, kindle, anything with Internet you name it. there are some cool features on the laptop version like the web clipper that I recommend checking out
B007G92QGO|4.0|This novel gives an accurate account of what parents experience when their child is accused of an inhumane act.<br />It left me with harrowing thoughts as I empathized with the love of a parent.<br /><br />An insightful read that will no doubt leave &#34;knocking&#34; thoughts in your mind
B00992CF6W|5.0|My 9 year old daughter is so infatuated with this game; it's sometimes hard to pry her away from the game for minutes at a time. This game really fuels her imagination and creativity.
B003U9W3GM|5.0|This is truly the pinnacle of &#34;pacific war&#34; experiences.<br />Whilst I am well read in such material, &#34;With The Old Breed&#34; is in a class of it's own.<br /><br />This is a &#34;bucket list&#34; read.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I really enjoy books by Colleen Hoover. The stories are always different! I would recommend this book to anyone, I loved it!
B004TSXUWY|4.0|This novel had me gripped from the first chapter.<br /><br />It is intriguing and deceptive in that you are never really sure what is going to transpire.<br /><br />Thoroughly enjoyed
B00AMBLXP8|4.0|Great movie for one liners, not a fan of Mila Kunis now she is hanging with ashton crapsack, but still a above average movie.  Good for some laughes..
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|love it...just wish coins regenerated faster ....the only game I enjoy playing. would recommend this game to anyone interested in it.
B004SBX112|4.0|I really enjoy playing this game.  I wish they'd come out with another free version soon.  It's a fun way to de-stress.
B007OAAK0O|5.0|If you were there or if you were lucky enough to see Diana Ross you would have known the world was not going to end in 2012. Didn't you see her on top of the pyramid? On the first day she gave her soul to the rain Gods and demanded equal return. Wet with passion she sang for the safety of her family. Then she returned on Friday and found this side of glory would not only be a one woman sacrifice for all and a fun carousel for all to join. The singing just kept on getting better and Dinah Ross's kindness, touching humanity was there for the gods and the people to see and rejoice. Saved oh yeah.
B007L6VR12|5.0|great job the movie was great. we watched twice. did great job came when i need it love :-). will order agin
B008RNGCAO|5.0|I loved being able to contrast it with nolans take. This was much better! Hard price to bet also. A+
B005P06AAO|5.0|the one that recieved this set<br />Really was amazed that I was able to find the movies<br />she requested.She told her friends about it.<br />thanks amazon great place to find what you want
B004IK8PLE|5.0|His ability to weave stories together throughout history is amazing. When seemingly unrelated characters appear, you quickly realize everyone over the centuries are completely related and necessary to the overall story.
B00AQ3K8IU|1.0|I downloaded this book to my Nook and I'm so mad I wasted $3.99 of my $50.00 giftcard.  I DON'T GET THESE 5 STAR REVIEWS?????<br />Is the author and her friends writing them?  I am an avid reader and this book STINKS! So boring, and so predictable.  I really thought I had accidently downloaded the<br />wrong book.  I don't get what people are raving about.  Unreal.
B0001AUAU4|5.0|Love, love this classy, romantic album!!!
B002NZTZ8S|5.0|Our family watched the movie together the night before Christmas. My 5 years old son is at the age questioning about Santa and was planning to stay  late to wait for Santa. After watching this movie, he changed his mind. After poured a cup of milk, got a plateful cookie for Santa and couple of apples for Santa's Reindeer, he went to sleep. Next morning my son was very happy to find out that Santa and his reindeer came to our house and ate the food. He exclaimed &#34;Yes, Santa IS real!&#34;
B004ZWKWQQ|5.0|This Lego model was not sold in stores nor have I seen it on any commercials.  But I'm glad I found it because the model is a very good size (around 2').  Looks like the real thing too.  And I don't see many space shuttle toys, so this lego is worth the money.  Great find.
B00992CF6W|1.0|I. wasted 7 dollars on this I. thought it was v1.5.0 but no it's. 0.4.0 it is so wrong my brother and I were planning to make a whole town but know we can't.
B00AMBLXP8|3.0|An okay movie. Made me laugh once, maybe twice, not terrible but I probably won't watch it for a second time. If your into generic simple humor this may be the movie for you.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|It captured my interest from page one. If you're interested in what is waiting for us after death, told by a person who didn't believe in near death experiences until it happened to him. He has been on \\"super soul Sunday\\" with Oprah. Good interview.
0810994739|5.0|fun for all ages.....anybody can read......hard back is the way......my son loved it for x-mas.....would buy more anytime...was great all around...
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I almost never rate five stars. But for hopeless I only wish I could rate more. Well it's 3am and I have to be at work by 7:30am . Trust me you will love this book no matter how much sleep you lose.
B007WPLZAK|5.0|Fell in love a little bit with Eddie Redmayne in Les Miserables so I have been watching projects he has been in since seeing him.  This series, based on the book, Birdsong, is excellent and worth your time.  Not only is he nice to look upon, but the boy can act as well!  Be prepared to emotionally invest yourself a bit in these characters.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|Absolutely LOVED this book! It was a fun and fast read, with lots to keep me going. For a book that I only chose because it was free, I was extremely happy with how great it was! :)
B0085A9HXS|3.0|for what it is, a good time popcorn movie. But a question to everybody. After seeing this, did anybody watch the new \\"Dredd\\" and think they have seen it all before? I have to think this movie was one of the inspirations for \\"Dredd 3D\\"
B005DD7H50|5.0|I think the concept of being able to take a pill and improve your &#34;brain power&#34; is absolutely fascinating.  Would I do this?  Don't know. Bradley Cooper starts out as a real loser then learns to live (we think) without the medication and seems to do just as well, if not better.  I certainly can recommend this movie to anyone.  PS. this is the third time I've seen it.
B00AO2P3GA|2.0|I gave this game a two stars because I bought the game and tells me to install it but always says a error has accord to the installation I have alredy haughty the game but cant install so right now I just wasted 7 dollars on nothing
B004LWZWGK|5.0|Blu-ray is as flawless as the previous Batman. Every area of the product and movie itself is just excellent. If you like action movies that are candy to your eyes and ears look no further. I also loved how the movie allows you to take full advantage of your big screen tv; just like previous batman the aspect ratio switches, in other words sometimes you have the black bars on top and bottom and other times you don't, best part you really don't notice it unless you are anal like me.
B009MCRHH6|5.0|This is an essential game, one of the finest of the last decade or so, across all platforms. Help rescue goo and follow the rather weird and amusing story of goo. This is a marvel of creative genius.<br /><br />I have only played through the first few levels on my phone, but so far I am astonished that this looks as good on my phone as it does on my PC! (except smaller, of course) And this game really lends itself to a touch screen, so it's great on a phone. It'd be great on a tablet as well.
0307383415|4.0|The book was delivered quick although I thought the cover was not in the best condition. I would not have classified this as &#34;Good&#34; condition although I suppose it could have been a lot worst. There were a lot of creases in the cover. The rest of the book seems to be in good condition though.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Howey's characters live! Even when they die, they do it with such panache and for such excellent reasons as to remain unforgettable. I've read many SF novels over the years, starting with Heinlein, Asimov and Clarke, moved on to McCaffrey, Weber, Robinson and others, but now I've discovered Hugh Howey, I feel like I've found a new favorite. His creation of the Silos, and the slowly unfolding reason for their being, along with the variety of personalities within is compelling, exciting, and beautifully written. As an editor, I deal with a lot of bad grammar, lousy sentence structure, and poorly created conflicts. I found none of those errors in this book. I enjoyed the Wool Omnibus so much I have now ordered the next two in the series, with plans to start reading them tonight. I'll be looking for more in this exciting series, and recommending it far and wide.<br /><br />Nice job, Hugh. Keep 'em coming.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I absolutely loved this book, and would totally read it again!!! I have already recommended it to others as well!
B005FISC52|5.0|Really enjoyed the season, it was really exciting and finished perfectly. I was sad it's ended after watching all nine seasons
B006LL5W6O|4.0|It was interesting to see how the characters developed.  I was a bit disappointed at first as they came across as flim flam artists.  The they got caught up into a \\"real life fairytale\\" and it was pretty exciting. The ending was not disappointing!
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|This story was totally different to what I thought it would be like. It was quite deep but I enjoyed it.
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|love playing the game with my family and am getting a little better at drawing but have a long way to go.
B002JVWR4U|5.0|I bought this for a gift for my son. He wanted it and he likes it. That's why I gave it a five star.
B004SJ3AXI|5.0|I am hooked on this game just love it.  Never had played it before i got the kindle and so far don't miss a day.
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|Love this show..... can't wait to see what happens next!  So many twists.  Love the repeat characters having different roles each season.
B0007Q6PBK|3.0|I dont know much about this product it was a secret santa gift but i think its was what my secrect santa asked for so he was happy with it.
B004QKNXIQ|5.0|A truly wonderful movie! The visuals, the music, the story, and the voice actors are spectacular. It doesn't have the emotional depth of a Miyasaki movie but it is a lovely take on the fairytale.
B001KDQ4KQ|4.0|Jodi Picoult does it again!  Painfully sad story, but had me from the first page as usual.  I love this author.
B009VB7P6G|5.0|I'm an animation junkie and yes, I love this movie. Tink and her friends, old and new, have a great new adventure.
B00AO2P3GA|1.0|This game is exactly like BO2. Total Rip off<br />Gameloft is a good company. But this is just low. Gameloft you should be getting a letter from Activision pretty soon douchebags.
B000Q63GWM|5.0|I love this pack I was very impressed.  I would definitely recommend this product.  My friend sure loved it also.
B0013FSL3E|5.0|This movie is just what my 2 year old niece wanted for christmas and let me just say that we have watched this movie like 200 times literally. Thank you so much. Best gift ever! (for her anyway).
B00APUQRPC|2.0|poor character development--the trite recipe of having a clint eastwood character act like every other clint eastwood character just didn't seem believable.  probably the worst eastwood movie i've ever seen.  gave JT a chance as a baseball player, but i'm sorry, it doesn't work, even though he is a good golfer.  he's just too little to be believable.  bad casting.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Loved this series.  This book itself was really well written and had a great plot to it.  Would definitely read again and worth the money I paid on Kindle for this.
B004J64QSI|5.0|I love Les Miserables and have see the stage play twice. I've seen this video many time and love it each time I see it.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I loved the Hunger Games trilogy.  I was kind of hesitant at first but once I started reading I could not put this down.  Great story line and well written.  Loved it.
B000FBFN1U|5.0|I'm a quarter of the way through book three of Game of Thrones, it's as good as the first two. Love ether series...
B003O86FMW|5.0|Could not put this down and almost immediately ordered the 3rd book in series after finishing this.  Great story and would read again.
B00AA0TJO8|5.0|I really enjoy playing this very creative game!  With challenging puzzles, fun animation, and an interesting storyline, this game is entertaining all the way around!
B005HSG3VK|4.0|The fact that my Kindle is protected when it falls on the floor is a big plus. I ave ot work at getting the flap to stay put sometimes and sometimes I get it just right.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|This book is way better than the movie it has way more detail<br />and the book is good if you like adventure
B008HTQ28K|4.0|Great read with twist in the tale. Found it tough to put down.A true insight into injustices in the judiciary and how it can be manipulated. One Grisham I would recommend for certain.
B005LAIHY0|1.0|The tape was bad. I didn't watch it soon enough to return it within the warranty. My bad. Can someone tell me what happens at the end of the movie?
B0098VYCCE|1.0|What a stupid boring movie!  I barely made it to the end. It has no real story, no dialog, no character development.  Nothing but special effects! A total waste of time
B009ZZDNT6|1.0|when I click on get app it tells me I need a credit card. If it's free why do I need a credit card? I don't get it. Any suggestions?
B008458O3S|5.0|This is an addicting game!  I love figuring out the methods.  The first few levels ar emore tutorial, but the game gets pretty challenging later.
B0074MZSWW|4.0|After a first listen, &#34;I Ain't the Same&#34; and &#34;Hold On&#34; are still my favorites. I like the flow and sound that this band was able to put together.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|very entertaining! cant quit playing! recommend you anyone who loves to play games! just bought the extended version. look forward to more challenges.
B0075MFS9Y|5.0|I've thought about it, and I think this is my favorite album of the year. I hesitate to say it, but if you enjoy Mumford & Sons, I think you'll like The Lumineers, who manage to be similar to M&S without being a carbon-copy of them.
B000FC12L4|5.0|This book is both a continuation of the story started in \\"Sabriel\\" and a stand-alone story. Lirael, Daughter of the Clayr, is lacking the Sight, a birthright of her people. Sameth, a Prince of the Old Kingdom and a supposed Abhorsen-In-Waiting, is lacking the courage to go into Death. Something must be done if the Old Kingdom is to survive. I liked the Lirael parts of the book more than Sameth parts, but I still symphatsize more with Sam's fear of Death and its creatures than with Lirael's constant self-pity over her lack of Sight. It takes her a while to realize that she is a person first, and not just a receptacle of a Gift. And then there are Mogget and the Disreputable Dog with their clouded backstory and constant antics! They and the straightforward, concise magical/religious system are the best parts of both the series and this book.
B009HQ9UHC|4.0|If you like Angry Birds but want something a little different or challenging, this may be the game for you! Caution: more thinking involved.
B000FC10IO|5.0|Things couldn't get much worse for the untried defenders of the Old Kingdom, Lirael and Sameth. The Dead are on the march as never before, the King and the Abhorsen are missing and presumed dead, and Sam's friend, Nick, is instrumental in unearthing an ancient evil that had destroyed countless worlds and hungers to finish off this one. The book fairly explodes with action as Lirael and company battle enormous odds to save the world as they know it. The origins of Mogget and the Disreputable Dog are finally explained, despite the Dog's many attempted evasions. Lirael's trip to the Ninth Gate of Death is my favorite moment: an enormous starry sky reassures us that Death is a natural conclusion to life, not something to be feared, which is hard to remember amid all the violence and revolting creatures the Abhorsen has to deal with. All in all, it's a great final installment of a great series.
B005ZOBNOI|4.0|I expected this book to be predictable but it's a great read and journey and . Left me in tears
B000FC13MM|5.0|The mage Abhorsen of the Old Kingdom is missing, and his schoolgirl daughter, Sabriel, takes it upon herself to find out exactly what happened to him. To this end, she must travel to the mythical Old Kingdom, a place she can barely remember and for which many dangers she is wholly unprepared. With a magical (and perhaps malevolent) creature Mogget and a long-lost prince at her side, she must defeat an evil that threatens both her old home and new, as well as master a birthright she knows little about and face the greatest loss of her young life.<br />I don't see the reson this book is labeled Young Adult, except that the main characters are in their late teens. This is fantasy at its best, with strong, believable characters and a UNIQUE magic system - which is saying a lot in this genre.
B00AFCEIB0|5.0|I like the Google search board because it's easy to use and finds the information you are looking for in a few easy to follow steps.
B000HIVIOW|5.0|My family had this movie on VHS and we would watch it about every other day leading up to Christmas.  This year we decided to up-grade to the DVD and watched it many times.  I love that the movie has almost not speaking and also the soft watercolor animation.  It's such an innoscent, sweet movie.  Good for any age (as evidenced by the fact that my husband and I don't get tired of watching it), but especially for small children.  It will bring the magic of making snowmen real for them!
B006MW3UZW|5.0|This was a gift for my daughter- can't wait to watch it!  I bought this series because of rave reviews and numerous accolades.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This amazing piece of literature has taught me some of the unseen points in life. Hazel has a humorous look on her situation that gives even the tiniest hint of enlightenment on to this tragic story that propelled me through this book with tears streaking down my face. To the weak of heart I do not recommend this to you, but I highly appraise this as one of the more glorious of books that I have read in my being on this earth. The fault is not in our stars but in our ambitious nature as humans, but after all isn't that what makes us... human?
B000003MZU|5.0|Had been listening to the songs on Pandora.  So happy now that I can listen to them any time I want.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Couldn't put it down! Definitely not necessarily what I was expecting when I bought the book, but even more amazing than I hoped. This book deserves every bit of the hype it's gotten.
B00AMBM9MO|3.0|Cute, but not a side-splitter. Knew it was going to be an adult-only movie, but the vulgarity was a bit much. Made this sailor blush. Wait til it comes out for free on Prime, so when you're finished watching you won't give yourself a &#34;Gibb's Slap&#34; (NCIS reference) in the head for buying it.
B008K8X0IS|5.0|Just received this boxed set in the mail and it's gorgeous! The box is really makes the set seem very fancy. The included dragon's egg (paperweight) is heavy and looks nicely made and kind of seems more expensive than should be included in the set, considering what I paid for it...<br /><br />The discs are all well organized and in wonderful shape and I can't wait to sit down and watch the whole season! The one down-side I've found is that it includes the digital version of the seasons, which I just found out doesn't work on my Kindle Fire. Not a slam to the makers of the set, just an observation for anyone else hoping to watch the season on their tablet.
B005IQ39AY|2.0|UPDATE: The game is also available on Google Play. That version doesn't have the crash problem, and the occasional ads are far less annoying than the crashes described below.<br /><br />ORIGINAL REVIEW:<br /><br />This is a very nice looking game that plays smoothly UNTIL you reach upper levels (40+). Then it suddenly starts saying \\"Level Failed,\\" even when I have plenty of \\"stones\\" left (sometimes hundreds and I've successfully cleared the playing field.<br /><br />I've almost reached the point of uninstalling in disgust, but I'm leaving it installed on my tablet so I'll get notifications if the developer ever fixes this problem (which is mentioned in a number of other reviews).<br /><br />It's a shame the developer hasn't moved to fix a problem that ruins an otherwise great game.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|Defending Jacob:  This book is a compelling novel.  Each chapter entices you to move onto the next chapter as the suspense continues to build.  The author writes in a manner that is so easy to relate to.  This is definitely one of the BEST books I have ever read.
B00004UEDQ|5.0|RECIEVED PRODUCT VERY QUICKLY AND IN EXCELLENT SHAPE, VERY HAPPY AND WILL BE DOING MORE BUSINESS WITH COMPANY, LOVE THE MOVIE ONE OF HER BEST
B008IJTFYW|5.0|I love the variety of sounds and how you can layer them to get just the sound you want. Very relaxing. Does great putting me to sleep.
B00AHXIC50|5.0|This album gives me life I tell you! It's a balance between a distraction and a healing for what Im going through. Good job Bruno, grammys grammys and more grammys
B0085TKAW6|5.0|A wonderful author - while I like the history of the world wars - I have trouble reading and digesting just facts - the presentation of these facts behind the lives of the fictional characters - certainly bring history to more people.  Trouble - now have to wait for the final book of the trilogy.
B00A2BTCTC|5.0|It's very cool<br />The hubby loves it<br />His fave band<br />Im glad it had a blu ray with the story also so you can read or watch...<br />Very Cool!
B002ZG976U|5.0|This is burlesque without the x rating.  It was wonderfully entertaining.  I had seen it before I purchased it, and I felt that it would be a great movie to add to my collection.
B0095ZMMCK|5.0|Love the a ability to continue a favorite story line into new areas. Great build up! Intense all the way to the end.
B0063FGFK0|5.0|If you liked the book by Chuck Hogan, you would love this DVD. Ben's extended version with alternate ending is the version he wanted to put out that was closer to the book, but a bit more rough than the version that went to the theater. American audiences tend to like happier movies with lots of action, so he had to edit it a bit. I'm a big fan of this movie and I am very happy with this version!
B002BI6SMI|4.0|Very good action packed movie.  The only thing that would have made it better would be a bit more on the main character's background.  How'd he get to be a 50 plus year old Jack Bauer?
B009JBZH54|5.0|this is what you call an amazing by.this comes with all 3 movies in Blu ray and in ultraviolet which is amazing so I can watch it on my tablet and phone and desktopdesktop.comes with hours and hours and hours and hours of extra content an awesome booklet only thing is the box was a lot smaller than I expected it to be. But I'm not complaining again, this is an amazing buy.perfect for any Batman lover who also thanks Christopher Nolan's performance is adequate.
B00A6PD9I4|5.0|Took my daughter too it on a date night in theaters and we laughed so hard we had to share it with the rest of the family when rental was possible.  You have to see it twice to catch all the hilarious stuff in the background.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I didn't want to put this book down..Nicholas Sparks never disappoints!! I defiantly recommend this book...you will be glad you did
B009HEJXFS|1.0|What we could see and hear of the movie was okay but most of it was so fuzzy and pixelated as to be almost unwatchable.  Kudos to Amazon customer support for refunding my rental fee.  I used it to rent another Amazon movie the next night that played flawlessly.
B005CRQ2DK|5.0|I loved it so much. It's funny manny thinks he needs all the heat.Anybody who reads this should give it a 5 STAR
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|I wasn't sure if I would even like American Horror Story.  But to my surprise after viewing Season 1 in one evening I had to see Season 2.  The program keeps you on edge and guesssing.  Ready for Season 3
B008JGSM6G|5.0|The game is simple and easy to understand· on top of that it is quite addicting with some easy levels mixed in with the more difficult levels for a good median of
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|I really loved this game even though it was too short I like games that have to do with searching and story lines and kind of scary I really do enjoy them can you come out with other games like this one I would really apprreciate it alot so let me know if you're gonna have a sequel to this game like prontooooo.
B0024RIMBG|4.0|The music was good but I was expecting more.<br />I would recommend it to anyone as it is a good CD.
B009VB97EY|3.0|But the script seems to have been written by an 8th grader. Don't get me wrong, I'd watch it again. The premise was good, the routines are great, but the words spoken are juvenile at best and most of the acting is shallow. But.... The bodies are HARD and guaranteed to please!!!!!! 5 STARS for the EYE CANDY!  /\ _/\
B00APUYWYA|3.0|Probably a good watch for teenage girls but not really my thing. Nice vocals in the program is your into singing.
B0015AARJI|1.0|When it arrived the joystick rubber was ready to fall off. If you shock it you can hear something rattling in the controller which means it was broken. I paid $26 something for it and it was a waste of my money. I was very unhappy. since I got it around Christmas time I was offered a refund of $15 or send it and get it all back. Yet I have to pay for shipping and with the holidays I cant pay for shipping. So now I have a broken controller at my house and is out on $26 and I have upset kids.
0142001104|5.0|The Art of Possibility is a must read for anyone interested in expanding their personal or business life. I would highly recommend to all.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|Good game really fun<br />It a aggravates me allot but it is really fun some of the games are really hard to beat but others are super easy
B008GAXV84|5.0|Great collection! This is a great way to really get to know a composer's work. I'd highly recommend to anyone interested in Borodin!
B009YP9L7U|4.0|I liked this book ,it kept my interest. I would recommend it to anyone who likes to read romances it could have been a little more juicer.
B009G7ZYPY|5.0|Susan Boyle is blessed with a magnificant voice. Every song on this CD is a treasure and is arranged and sung beautifully. This is a must for your musical collection and another triumph for Ms. Boyle. BRAVO!! Keep singing!!!
B009YP9L7U|5.0|\\"Waking Up Married\\" draws you in from the very first page. Impossible to put down once you start. Great read!
B009RI4FRU|5.0|My wife and I loved this movie.  Great story, acting, and music.  We only rented it, but plan to buy!
B000JO9JHW|5.0|Seriously, once I started on these over Christmas break i devoured 2 seasons worth in about 4 days. I'd heard friends and co-workers rave about it, but never had the chance to dive in.<br /><br />Kind of a mix between Burn Notice and Miami CSI on steroids, Dexter's dark past sets up a dysfunctional adulthood populated with characters that give this series tension, suspense, and moments of comic relief. You'll probably find ample opportunities to discuss larger themes of interpersonal relationships, addiction and mental health with other viewers as you dig into these characters' responses to their world.<br /><br />I'm hooked!
B003JTHXOK|5.0|This book was amazing. The ending is something you would never suspect. Great romance thriller. Nicholas Sparks has disappoint! I love everything her writes!
1451638450|4.0|&#34;Captain Vorpatril's Alliance&#34; is Bujold back to her old form - greatly missed and greatly enjoined.  I thought &#34;Cryoburn&#34; was stiff and boring, and was disappointed in the newest of the &#34;Miles&#34; series; the switch to &#34;Ivan&#34;, as her protagonist, seems to have invigorated the author.  This book is just plain fun.
B0053TMP24|5.0|I recommend all the books in this series!  In fact, I love all the series by Rick Riordan.  I've read them all.
8866130931|5.0|I buy this product each year and am never disappointed.  Easy to use, I personally like the large pages and the compartment in the back
B008AK8FHM|3.0|Wasn't very impressed, thought he would actually go into more detail about experience in heaven. appreciated all of medical insight bc I'm a nurse. maybe I was disappointed bc I had just read heaven is for real, a little boys journey to heaven and back.... that story brought me to tears numerous times.....
B001974DG0|5.0|This book makes my 5th copy of this book. but now on my Kindle.  I have read and reread this novel, it is my #1 favorite book.  Dean Koontz is a phenomenal writter and I always love the dogs in all his novels, especially the one in Watchers.
B002BWP49C|5.0|Really enjoyed this from the cost to the shipping quickly to everything. I loved the movie itself. Nothing was wrong with the movie at all!
B005K0HDGE|5.0|One of my favorite authors, this is such an amazing take on 11/22/63.  I really enjoyed his view and if only time travel were possible!
B001UV4XFG|5.0|I recommend everyone buy this movie! I recommend this product to everyone in the world! You will love it! I'm going to buying my best friend these movies soon!
B000FC13E0|5.0|Great read!!  Michael Crichton is among the list of my favorite authors, I have several of his books because he always has an excellent plot and story line.
0525952926|5.0|Winter of the World is just as good as was Fall of Giants --. Make sure you read Fall of Giants first.  You will have trouble following the family stories in Winter without having met the previous generation in Fall --<br /><br />Historically well research -- with details woven seamlessly into the fictional characters stories that hold the whole book together --<br /><br />Rather than a criticism -- how about a couple of suggestions --<br />First, its over a 1000 pages so either plan to be patient or set aside several days to read it<br />Second -- and related -- I still love the feel of a book in my hands but appreciate the convenience of my e-reader.  I am looking for pricing, in the future, which provides both formats for a single price.
B004LROUNG|5.0|Good book!!  Excellent read!  I see why this author is so popular and have several books he has written.  He has an excellent writing style.
B005LAJ1PE|5.0|It was a Christmas gift  and it came in time I was very happy and so my my son. Great job
B001KDQ4KQ|3.0|An interesting study of the problems that can arise from a lack of personal boundaries and the long standing expectations that we place on ourselves and the people in our lives.  Predictable and angst filled, the book was adequately compelling to hold my attention.  Picoult's insight into the human condition is good even with the details of the telling are lacking.
B000050GQM|4.0|It's not the run-of-the-mill, action-packed thriller. It develops slowly with a gorgeously sinister air. With its beautiful cinematography and excellent acting, it ultimately packs a terrific punch.
B00688628M|5.0|Superbly done; incredible location scenes; ever detail captured.  Did I mention riveting?  Just when you thought WWII movies had all been done,this brings another side to the greatest war ever fought.
0446547654|5.0|I have all of his books and I have read this one over and over again!  It touched so many places in my heart that I couldn't put it down.  Originially bought it for my Kindle, but then HAD to have the hard copy.  This book was written just at the right time in my life.
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|I literally just got this app today, and I already love it! I'm really glad this was a freebie and it will help me get up tomorrow morning, even though I don't want to, personally.
B00A4YVHXQ|4.0|My son loves this piano game.  He follows along and taps the keys as they fall just like guitar hero.  This is definitely a keeper for seasonal games at least for the next few years to come
B002ZB26AO|5.0|The mystery of North Korea isn't completely revealed in this book but it still offers insightful second hand accounts of life during the 80's and 90's under the rule of Kim Il sung and Kim jong il. It is a page turner worth a read.
B0051UP5NQ|5.0|I guess this is the best app for office files out there. Because everybody is recommending it. Try it on my phone,really nice interface and really useful.
B000PHX4VA|5.0|I remember my Mom played The Police back when I was 5 years old in Kindergarten when she had one of their albums on cassettes. I have all 5 of The Police albums including some of their greatest hits as well. I kept hearing a sample of the song Fall Out a few times & I was jamming to it to the point that I downloaded the song onto my iTunes. I finally purchased this 2 disc set and I heard all the songs on there. If you like Sting & The Police, then this 2 disc set is for you.
6305878323|5.0|Everybody will love this film, grandparents, parents, all the young ones. It has live action, cartoon sequences, and fantasy all rolled up in a technicolor package.
B000001E8S|5.0|When I got this album in the mail, I listened to it right away in my disc changer. The sound effects were pretty cool even most of the songs sounded like they would play mostly in Japan in my opinion. I have put this album with the rest of my U2 collection. If you're a huge U2 fan then you will like this album.
B005OCFHHK|5.0|Fabulous movies and in a compact case for storage.  I highly recommend the set for any Harry Potter fan. Thumbs up
B00AHXIC50|4.0|I love Bruno Mars! very talented. His albums are great this one included! spend the money on it. you wont regret it!
B001GLYMK6|2.0|It's an OK romantic comedy. If I hadn't seen the original may be it would have been more enjoyable - it just doesn't have the magic of the Korean version.
0062082353|5.0|Anyone would like this book.<br />Another book you may like if you enjoyed this book here would be Lone Survivor
B00A757EFW|5.0|Coolest app ever I love it so much my parents love to play on it because since its so old they love to play it
B001OQCV6A|4.0|Without going into a movie review, as there are better locations for that, I enjoy this move.<br /><br />In addition, the product was shipped promptly, arrived in excellent condition and I had no issues with this purchase.
B0083ZRAJS|5.0|I got this for my kids because even though we've seen the movie many times, it's good to read the original source. It's a great classic for kids and adults alike. A must read book.
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|Good but rather depressing story. At least throughout the whole novel, the reader stayed hopeful. I'd definitely recommend to someone who likes dramatic romance.
B003TT2X72|5.0|Hubby received as a present as they are his favorite movies. He is especially pleased with all the bonus materials included.
B009MCRHH6|5.0|This is one of the most addictive and fun games I have ever played!! You will end up playing for hours and won't even realize it. I would definitely recommend this to anyone who loves a challenge.
B001HBYHFA|5.0|This was really good but a little sad.  I do not think they should have killed off  of the characters then they did.  Really good and adds to the series.  I bought this one!
B0091QSNEE|5.0|4 year old daughter loves this.  She wants to play it all the time.  I'm now using this as a reward for her.  If she wants to play it, she has to earn it by doing small chores around the house, like cleaning up her barbies or putting her doll house furntiture back into the dollhouse.  Wish I could rate it 10 starts because of the extras i've been able to get out of it lolol
B009CGB1SS|5.0|This is just as good as I remember.  I wish they would remake it and then also make a second one.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Amazingly good<br />Sweet ending to a triumphant story of an unlikely revolution. I can't wait for the 2nd and 3rd installments come out as movies.
B009VB97EY|1.0|I was really expecting a better story and more dancing.  I was rather disapointed.  I was actually expecting Chip & Dales but that did not happen.
B00APUYWYA|5.0|Loved pitch perfect. It reminds me of bridesmaids, but with cleaner content and a lot a lot more singing involved.
B004LWZW9C|5.0|This DVD is really good. Several different stories from cradle to grave.  Really touching and a pleasure to watch. Had humor and something for everyone.
B006L1TT8G|5.0|Alright! Well for ONE: It came 18 days before they said it would= WOW. I was really excited to listen. Only a couple of scratches on the back of the case, and the CD was perfect. I seriously reccomend you to anyone. Amazing.
B000OZ0NXA|5.0|It was my first Jack Reacher book and I enjoyed it immensely.  It moved with a steady purpose and kept your interest throughout the book.
B005H0IW6W|5.0|Sweet sounds and lots of great songs.  I did not realize that I liked him.  I bought it as part of a set with 2 other albums I wanted.
B0027MJU00|5.0|I couldn't put this book down. I've lost a few nights sleep while juggling my children and husband, just trying to find out more about each character. When I wasn't reading, I was thinking of the characters..wondering what they were doing, how they were doing...as if they were real and I knew them. That's incredible writing! I would recommend this book to anyone on any caliber. Can't wait to start the next novel..thank you
B004XUMOCA|5.0|Best series I personally have ever watched on TV. Just goes to show since there was only one season, Hollywood hasn't a clue. But all these ridiculous \\"reality\\" TV shows are taking over prime time. Has America lost that much IQ? No imagination anymore. Top tier entertainment gets replaced by shaky camera fake drama. God help us.
B0086700CM|2.0|It wasn't described well before I bought it. I looked in to how to delete it from my kindle fire.
B0076DELIG|5.0|Very good kindle read and up to Michael Connelly's standards as set in the previous books. I enjoyed the main plot as well as the minor story threads continued in this book. Harry remains true to character as do the others in this book.I recommend this book to readers familiar with Harry Bosh as well as Michael Connelly. Even if one has not  read the series, it is possible to sample what it is about with this read and then return to read the series in order.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|i picked 5 stars because facebook is the best.i have found many friends and relatives i havent seen in years.how can you beat that.i am hook on facebook.should have been on  it sooner.
B005LAIIQC|5.0|How could you not watch this over and over!  It is awesome and has the much desired action plus a great story!  You will want more after seeing it once.
B003ODIZL6|5.0|It's great I love it,it teaches you everything you need to know.I have not done much in it,but so far it is great.
B000NQRE9Q|5.0|Very impressed with the blu-ray on this collection - excellent in video and audio - pleased with the great artwork on the cover
B008XG1X18|5.0|I love pinterest! I always find something new to try. I probably use pinterest more than any other site. From home ideas to recipes to new hairstyles to try on my granddaughter.
B004LWZWGK|5.0|This is truly a great work and you will enjoy sound, picture, and scenes that will make you watch this many times - so much to enjoy you can't take it all in with one viewing
B006TF6WAM|5.0|A great read for anyone with imagination. If you like a simple storyline with plenty of raw emotion this is the book for you.
B004SOR4H6|4.0|Quien no use twitter no sabe lo importante que es encontrar las cosas de un click y no tener q estar login a cada rato. Es perfecto el twitter para kindle.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This book ripped my heart out from the first page. With a voice that felt so authentic and true and a story that surprises and confronts. John Green is a master storyteller.
B0099114WO|1.0|The movie was recommended. I wanted to see it because of the cast. What a disappointment.i will gladly watch any Jane Austen movie. Guess that explains it.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Tragic yet beautiful.  I. Loved. This. Book.  Thank you, Ms. Hoover!  Keep it up!  A forever fan of yours ~~AM
B005LAIIA8|5.0|As the title suggests, Frankenweenie is basically Frankenstein (1931) for children but with plenty of sly references for his older fans (at one point, Victor's parents are watching Christopher Lee as Dracula in a Hammer horror movie). Victor fits in quite nicely with Burton's roster of cinematic outsiders marginalized by the ignorant masses that misunderstand them. The atmospheric black and white stop-motion animation has a texture to it that almost feels tangible unlike most of the CG animated films being made today.<br /><br />\\"Original Short: Captain Sparky vs The Flying Saucers\\" is the clever movie within a movie that Victor creates (with Sparky's help) and is included in its entirety. It is a loving homage to alien invasion films from the 1950s.<br /><br />\\"Miniatures in Motion: Bringing Frankenweenie to Life\\" takes a look at the stop-motion animation process for this film. We see how the animators brought Burton's original drawings to life. It is wonderful to see all these people crafting a film with their hands instead of relying predominantly on CGI.<br /><br />\\"Frankenweenie Touring Exhibit\\" is a brief featurette about a traveling exhibit of props and production sketches from the film displayed for people from all over the world to see.<br /><br />\\"Original Live-Action Frankenweenie Short\\" was made in 1984 and was shot in gorgeous black and white. It's about a young boy named Vincent (Barret Oliver) who decides to resurrect his dead dog Sparky a la Dr. Frankenstein. Shelley Duvall and Daniel Stern play his very Leave It To Beaver-esque parents. Also featured is the late-great Paul Bartel as Vincent's science teacher.<br /><br />Finally, there is a music video for \\"Pet Sematary\\" by the Plain White T's. It is your standard tie-in video with the band playing over footage from the film.
B008ALA6DW|4.0|The macbook air was made for portability, less cables, but if you need to buy the adapter, buy the original, worth the money.
B005Q1W10A|5.0|Everything about this show is excellent - the acting, the plots, the writing and the scenery. I can't wait for Season 3!!!
B003Q6D1YW|5.0|Really fun to see Nev in his awkward stage and to come to know how he got his start in Internet un-matchmaking. His internet crush was so messed up. I love how Nev always tries to walk in the other person's shoes, find the positives and work things through with people. A refreshing opposite to most reality shows which try to destroy friendships or lives for the ratings. Also, liked finding out where the term Catfish came from.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|My husband and I got this game. It is really cute. I like that you can hatch and grow dragons.
B008XNZMOU|5.0|Shipped quickly, we preordered and it was delivered the day it was released. Good quality. Better than having just the digital version. It even has a real booklet with lyrics and credits which I haven't seen in a the last few cd's I've bought.
B008MEM24S|5.0|Perry is stuck and you need to get him to Major Monogram. My 7 year old loves it. It is just like where's my water.
0345529057|5.0|A must read for anyone and everyone who enjoys loosing themselves in another realm.<br />Read it now, then enjoy the HBO series!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I had this for my ds. I really like that it makes you work to open up the next game.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This has to be the best and funniest game I've ever played I think it's better than temple run but that's what I think but you guys should play duty it's a lot of fun because you can challenge your friends to get the best score and all the power ups.
B000AOENJA|3.0|I think i was just expecting too much.<br /><br />The album is still fantastic to listen to, but at first it was not clear what the \\"dual\\" disc would deliver.<br />I hoped for a multichannel version of the normal CD, but it was only \\"enhanced\\" stereo.<br /><br />In what way it is enhanced? I wouldn't know.. My amplifier normally states if it is 96 or 192Khz but in this case it didn't gave a clue on what bitrate the DVD side was recorded..<br /><br />Shame, as i really enjoyed many (multichannel) DVD-A's and SACD on my system.
B002VPE1WK|5.0|I got this bag for free because I purchased Canon T3i. I couldn't image how nice is this because it's free and the brand is Amazon. To my surprised, this bag is so nice. It has many some pocket that you can put everything in the bag. You can take at least 4 lens with you.
B0068LYEHA|1.0|The whole thing was a rambling of a silly girl and then a silly woman who focused way to much on herself!  I didn't connect with this girls feelings about womanhood AT ALL!!!!  I only finished half the book, couldn't stomach anymore!
B002VWNIDG|5.0|With the gifs on tumblr and everything, it was definitely something I wanted to see but my parents never had it. I never watched this movie but since I've always heard stuff about it I decided to order it. It's really a good movie and I see why everybody still loves it years after it was made. I'd recommend it to anyone. The product came fast and in excellent condition.
B0063IH60K|4.0|Just got my new kindle fire hd and down loaded solitaire. It is so smooth and great fun. It is very relaxing for me and helps me unwind.
B005RUUUAI|5.0|I don't have cable but was able to keep up with Season 2 right off my computer, which I hooked up to my television and watched religiously every week. I am addicted/obsessed with this show and will plan on buying future seasons through Amazon!
B007Q0OV6Q|5.0|I've started the tradition of buying a Lego Advent Calendar for my son each year. He loves opening a new window each day and finding a small lego set. He's still young enough that he needs help building them, but these small 5 to 10 piece sets are perfect for beginners.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|please someone help help me get into the locked cabinet in the office.  Hint puts me to the safe for the picture and nothing else.  Why can I Not figure this out.  Heeeeelp.  Great Color and great story.)
0307887960|2.0|I bought the book, because somebody recomend it.<br />It just an other diet book just an other way to eat.<br />I would not recomend it.
B002LE8D2K|5.0|there isn't not much to say about this product because ram is ram. IT does what it does. 8 gbs= 4x2gbs. No issue installing snap and go
B005IEGUDY|5.0|Mr Rutherford researches carefully- and it is apparent in his narrative of England.  His characters bring life to historical and geographical details in a way few can match.
B004ZJZPXO|4.0|Not a &#34;classic&#34; film, but a fun movie nonetheless.<br />Worth a shot if you are a fan of goofy sci-fi!
B007B6VOG0|5.0|If you enjoy the hits played on the radio from this band then you are going to love this whole album. Period. It is that good !
B008MG1E4A|5.0|I liked the book a lot. Been the story told from the point of view of one of the key guys in the mission is awesome. I just hope the writer doesnt get in troubles for sharing these details, but people really needs to know what happened and how did it.
B007SZ0E1K|5.0|The processor enders, video edits and games like a dream. It's no 3770K but it's a winner in my book!
B000R7GKQE|3.0|Characters are believable and great acting.  Very frightening at times with too much blood - especially from those already dead
B007R21JJK|5.0|I have no idea why some people tend to complain about this board. It holds one of the highest overclocks achieved for Ivy Bridge, has better components than ASRock's board, and has the same quality control as Asus, as Asus used to own Gigabyte. If technology, much less building computers, is out of your league, don't leave a poor review as a result of your shortcomings.<br /><br />For the record I'm holding a constant 4.6 Ghz on air coupled with a 3570K and maintaining 48* C on 95% load.
0345803485|1.0|Unfortunately, I was caught up in the hype and discussions with my girlfriends and curiosity drove my \\"mind-candy\\" purchase.  I cannot tell you how disappointed and how poorly written this trilogy was.  It is a bad sign when you are forcing yourself to finish out of pure stubbornness, just because you spent the money on it.  The subject matter felt unrealistic, the random \\"big words\\" thrown in to make the content meatier or more credible (not quite sure) felt overdone, and really, who has had that many orgasms in their lifetime?!?!?!  Good grief!<br /><br />On a positive note, the \\"romantic\\" scenes were nice reminders of what you can do to put spice back into your relationship - the things that tend to get driven out with the hecticness of everyday life......
B00A196SE2|5.0|People of all ages would love this show! I've been an obsessed fan since the start with the books and all! I love the cover although Vanessa & Jenny should be on it, but i know why there not. They refused to come back to the show! I wouldn't put them on there anyways! I can't wait for this to be released!
B007ZGBZHE|3.0|I thought there were some parts of the story that the outcome was not explained specifically enough.  The scenes on the island were a little beyond believable.
B004HAEGP4|2.0|Fight scenes are more unbelievable than a Steven Segal film. Characters are left undeveloped, serving simply as people to fire bullets as zombies. Plot is predictable. Essentially, it feels like a video game--but it's supposed to be a movie.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I LOVE. it!!!!!!!!! Its the best game ever with cool graphics.  Like the caves love the creepers but I hate the zombies. If I could give it 5000 stars I would.
B009C7ZQM4|5.0|very easy too use, never any problems, fast, reliable, nothing here to complain about, always does it's job and i feel very<br />secure with it..
B003TSEL7S|5.0|I like this book because there is a lot of action and mystery. I choose this rating because it was great.
B007XKEY6Q|4.0|i use it quite abit, doodle alot with it, try out many different ideas with it,<br />occupies my time nicely
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|What an intriguing book! I couldn't put it down....very touching, funny, sad, addictive....hadn't ever read books from this author, but looking forward to more!
B0083ZRAJS|5.0|I was delighted to read this book. As always the book far surpassed the movie. A wonderful read for all ages.
B001FB4VXU|5.0|I've loved this show for quite some time and it's nice to own it on DVD.<br /><br />(Four more words required)
B007UR1OHO|4.0|I liked it and it had a great message, I would have preferred it to keep going and delve more into their life after falling back in love, but other than that it was a wonderful movie.
B000W91RUG|5.0|I have always enjoyed this show.  Now I can watch it whenever I please!<br /><br />I thought the bazinga was implied
B009JZPH32|5.0|Best movie! LOVED it and continue to watch it. Definitely vulgar and realistic depiction of what it would be like in that world
B009VLX8FS|4.0|Very good album! My favorite tracks are Begin Again and Red. Taylor is definitely trying a new angle on her country girl style by going very modern pop music with this album but it's not bad and change is good as long as it is Taylor that is changing and not her label trying to make her into the next Britney Spears, Lady Gaga, Madonna.
B00AMBH70S|3.0|Not horrible, but not my favorite Bourne movie. I think they needed to get more in-depth with the storyline and how it connected to the originals.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Sure,I watched the movie of the Hunger Games without even considering reading the book.  But the movie was so good that I had to read the book.  Now I'm determined to read the rest of the books!
B00AE2J5HI|5.0|Wonderful movie with fabulous acting. I love the storyline, the people who played each character really made it believable, and I loved that it was based on a true story
B009C7ZQM4|4.0|easy to use, does not seem to have caused any issues with my OS or phone (Android HTC Thunderbolt) in any way, freed up a lot of space.
B00AMBK0X4|1.0|This was an awful movie and worst purchase. Someone said it was a great movie, and they obviously didn't watch it.
B008QTVNUI|5.0|Extremely addictive series. The story would be good for PG-13, however the raunchy scenes in every episode makes it a definite R-Rated show.
B002SS8S7E|5.0|Good Movie, a must see.  Streaming quality was good, fast and Amazon made it problem free.  Have no fears, enjoy.
B001HN694K|5.0|I bought two copies of this dvd because the first one had a glitch in it. Well... so does the second one so I'm wondering if it was manufactured that way. I give five stars to the movie itself -- I absolutely love it and I'm not a big Tim Burton fan either. I also hated the book when I was a kid, tried reading it a couple times, and just thought it was stupid (well you know how kids are!), but I love this version of the story! But as far as the manufacturing is concerned... I won't give away anything, will just say late in the movie you're watching one scene and it pauses and then jumps to another scene. Since it's on both dvds that I purchased I can't tell how much in between is lost. The rest of the dvd runs fine. Maybe I just got a hold of two bad copies, but I'm not about to buy a third! Anyhow, fantastic movie.
B009K0P10K|5.0|One of the best series I've seen and I've watched most of them!  What a web they weave!  Just be careful because you won't be able to stop watching!  I would definitely suggest you watch all of Season 1 first.
B005FISBTO|4.0|The package (or DVD case) was a little banged up. We wondered if it was used, but there were no scratches on any disk. Watchinig the season now, and were happy so far. It also arrived within 3 days of me placing the order, kind of awesome. Four stars though because of the dvd case damage, and it not being in the wrapper.
B0064MPXFA|5.0|Sorry I have to catch up but I am very pleased that I can get these on my Kindle Thanks
B0087GZ8YW|5.0|Another superb Rebus book.<br />I don't think he'll ever stop being a detective.<br />I would most definitely recommend this book.
B0095ZMMCK|5.0|Could not put it down.  Wife complained because I had things to do and kept reading.  Love Clancy.  Long book.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|The whole series of fifty shades is amazing, couldn't stop reading. I can't wait for the movies to come out!!!!
B000FCKC4C|5.0|A book that can help break your complacency.. and also make you chase your dreams.. and if you dont have any, this one will make you dream of the great treasures waiting for you !! Enjoy & All the Best !!
B0082Z1CVQ|4.0|It was a amazing book. I would love to read it again. I hope that you viewers will like it too.
0307165485|5.0|I get this book for every little one that is close to me. To me, its a classic! Has everything from ABC's to 123's to teaching you manners and things like getting ready for bed plus some really nice stories.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|It was good amazing even. One of the best books I have ever read. I would recommend it to anyone who is having a rough time in high school. These things can happen and its true. Any teenager can relate to this book. You feel Charlie's pain of what he's going through. We have all lost friends along the way and maybe not like Charlie but we still have. You lose touch with them but some friends you just can't lose no matter what. I live this book because you can relate to the pain and suffering of school and just life when your a teenager. Life sometimes become to hard to handle and you just can't take just remember there are people out there who are going through the same things as you are. Read this book and get there high school and onto college.
B005WUHAX8|1.0|This item appears to be a fake Lifeproof case.  My husband got it for me for Christmas and he already has one so it was easy to compare the differences.  First, it didn't fully pass the waterproof test you are supposed to do before putting it on your phone; but it passed the second time we did it, so we put it on.  Second, the screen protector does not lie completely flat and creates a bubble.  Third, after dropping it about 3 feet or less, the back of the case cracked.  My husband has dropped his real lifeproof case many times and it hasn't broken at all.  We are returning it.

B00A993UWM|5.0|So a 50 something dude is probably not supposed to love this music, but I do.  I bought the new P!nk, No Doubt, Emeli Sande and Ke$ha, and no doubt (sorry), this is the best of the bunch, better even than Animal and Cannibal, in my opinion.<br /><br />The lead single seems to be Die Young, which was a problem after the horrific shootings.  It is also probably the least good (I won't say its not good) song on the CD.  C'Mon, Crazy Kids, and many more are much better!<br /><br />Yes, you have to live through the F word, which means when I catch myself singing one of these while walking from my car to the grocery store I have to take that quick look around to make sure no old lady heard me.<br /><br />She really can sing, the songs are designed to show the variety in her musical skill set, she basically writes them herself, and she's a combination of real, funny, and self-assured that doesn't come along very often.  If you don't own this music, you need to....
B00006DEFA|5.0|Great film even though it is only about 30% &#34;true&#34;. Great music,<br />and Tom Hulce became Mozart.Abrahams is great and the<br />features with Forman and Schaffer are keen!

B004LWZWGK|4.0|I really just want to know if this version is worth owning vs. the other versions. Are the extra features worth the money?<br /><br />I can only scan through so many fan-boy wannabe movie reviews before I completely lose interest. I'm looking to buy the movie on Blu-Ray so clearly I liked it and could care less if you found it to be a fitting end to the trilogy or worthy of the Chris Nolan oeuvre. I just want a product review and not opinions on the content of the movie we all saw in the theater.
B0084B5TK8|5.0|I have always wanted to read this book and i am very happy that i did. It is as very good story and worth the time to read
B005LAII12|5.0|This isn't your mother's teddy bear.  &#34;Ted&#34; is quite the dirty ride.  Seth MacFarlane is rather brilliant with these kinds of characters.  After a while, you forget Ted is a stuffed bear and he becomes just another character.  The special effects bringing Ted to life are seamless with the sets and characters.  A subplot involving a father and son who have ill intentions toward Ted feels tacked on and unnecessary, but otherwise it's a great mindless raunchy comedy.
B00AMBLDEE|3.0|the bourne legacy took to long to get into the heart of the story just not what I expected at all.
B0091REZMW|3.0|Great graphics.  Cute silly scenarios.  Easy to play.  RUN out of diamonds and you are out of luck.  Still an enjoyable experience.
0786955554|5.0|The pieces are high quality and are easy to integrate. It is a very good material and indispensable for those who like to play RPG with miniatures. It's a good choice
B008CP6RWU|5.0|I first found this game on The Playstation Network; I was intrigued by the description of playing the game with others but not being able to communicate with them. What hooked me from the start was the music; it's very ethereal and relaxing and flows nicely with the game pace. Next you're struck by how small you feel in the expanse of the game, you're alone surrounded by sand so that when you finally do run into another player you're almost joyful, like you've been cut off from civilization and have been left wandering. The game is short, I think it clocks in at around 3 hours for full game play, but it's a nice relaxing way to spend an afternoon.
B007HC3LHS|5.0|I very much enjoyed the suspenseful story of an unfortunate girl who found herself in front of a murderer. Read this amazing book
B00821PCJS|4.0|It's a neat show. Not sure I would keep watching, but I thought I'd give it a try. Not bad.
B00846REIS|5.0|This book is amazing!!!! I couldn't put it down! I can't wait to read the next 2. I loved it.

B008AITJ24|5.0|Bones is a great show. There's a reason it's been on for eight seasons! It's got great characters, funny moments, dramatic moments, good writers, awesome special effects, and David Boreanaz. What more could you ask for?
B0068TJLSY|5.0|If you are from generation X this movie will rock for you! This movie took me back to my childhood and really took me on a wonderful ride! Yes it has alien monsters, but it is still a freaking cool &#34;this is childhood&#34; effect. Check it out.
B000LB7G00|5.0|Update: I recently had to re-install this on a new computer, and the current software install, 3.16.3 is packaged properly and installs fine right from the download, so my -1 is mooted.<br /><br />It is indispensable in the programs where I use it.  I just wish more supported it.<br /><br />---<br /><br />The Mouse came nicely packaged, but of course, it needs its drivers installed before you can do anything with it in the few programs that can take advantage of it. This was to prove the most frustrating part of installing it, but I found a solution which I will share.<br /><br />As of this writing, the driver version is 3.16.1. The CD in the package was version 3.7.18, which dates back to 2009. This isn't too horrible a problem, because the first thing the installer does is prompt you to check for a newer driver. Does it download the driver? No, it sends you to the web page. Does it send you to the driver download page? No, just the home page. But again, not a big deal, it's easy enough to navigate to the appropriate download link. This is fairly standard.<br /><br />Where it goes terribly wrong is after you download the file. The download, \\"3DxSoftware32_v3-16-1_r1342 . exe\\" will extract the installer, put it in your temp files, and run it. The big problem there is the installer it extracts, \\"3DxSoftware32 . exe\\" is part installer, part archive, but it doesn't know that. Immediately the installer will ask you to insert a disk because it can't find \\"layout.bin\\". Since you don't have that disk or that file, you're stuck. Installation fails. The one previous installer available suffers the same problem.<br /><br />After considerable poking around, trying to open a few stray .cab files that appeared, I found out about a free program called PeaZip on SourceForge. It does things that 7-Zip doesn't. And aside from opening .cab files, it did the one thing I needed to make this install work. I was able to select \\"3DxSoftware32 . exe\\" and choose \\"Open as archive\\" and then Idid \\"Extract all files\\" into the same directory, and THERE was everything I needed to do the install.  Run the setup file that appears and the install proceeds just as it would from the CD. Keep these files, because you might need to re-install if you add new 3d software that needs specific plugins.<br /><br />Having successfully slain the installer dragon, everything else from there was smooth sailing. I ran through the Demos, played the Puzzle game, and then set off into Second Life to try the Flycam. That was tremendously cool, but clearly I need a better video card. Next I went into Google Sketchup, apparently now owned by Trimble, and navigation was so much easier than trying to remember what chord of modifier keys would make things move the way I wanted. I have yet to use it with Blender, but that's next on the agenda.<br /><br />It is not a substitute for the mouse. It won't control the arrow cursor (although apparently there is a beta driver out there that might) but for 3D programs that support it, it is the perfect thing for moving your view around and manipulating selected objects along and around all three axes. So it's an adjunct to your regular mouse. It is delicately sensitive, a feather touch is all that is needed to fly your viewpoint around. So once you get past the terrible driver install issues, it works precisely as advertized. I can see it as an essential tool for anyone who works with 3D models.
B005RUUUAI|5.0|Completely addicted to this show! It is simply amazing!!! They should make all shows this good. I would never leave the house
B00AQMSJI2|3.0|I got this for my 5 year-old grandson who can't read well enough to play it...sure he could press where the arrow points, but I would think a game aimed at the age kid that plays with Playmobils would have pirates that talked.  We have the real Playmobil pirate sets and he loves to play with them. I guess we will just stick to playing with those as I would have to be right there with him to read the speech bubbles and instructions when he played this game.  The graphics and likeness to the real toy Playmobils is very good.  I also don't like that he could buy other apps unless I lock that feature in the parent controls.  Even with parent controls, he could still browse a bunch of other apps and share rewards on Facebook.  This is not a game for pre-readers.
B000I9YLUI|5.0|I love this version of this story. Kiera Knightly nails Elizabeth Bennett. The sexual tension between Mr. Darcy and Miss Bennett is palpable!
B0063GORYU|5.0|I play spider solitaire to de-stress at the end of the day. It really does it for me. Very<br />fun game to end my day with!
B009A87ZQU|5.0|Nothing to say more than this was a great buy. Bought this during the Christmas sales for my parents. They loved it!
B004U8VWIM|1.0|I was excited about seeing this film and wanted to like it given the hype but was bored after 45 minutes. Had my husband not also been watching it, I would've fast forwarded through most of the scenes. The back and forth of reality and fantasy for &#34;artistic&#34; reasons was confusing and annoying. Characters were cliches - stage mom, tortured ballerina, obsessed, driven director with gratuitous lesbian and masturbation scenes thrown in. I couldn't wait for Natalie Portman to throw herself off the stage.
B000NQRE9Q|5.0|Nothing to say more than this was a great buy. Bought this set during the Christmas sales for my parents. They loved it!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Never a dull moment or dead spot.  True page turner. Looking forward to the rest of the Hunger Games series.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Nothing to say more than this was a great buy. Bought this after watching the first season on PBS. It was wonderful.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|WOW- I downloaded this book and finished it in 24 hours.  It was that good.  Colleen Hoover has another hit on her hands with this one!<br />I loved Slammed and Point of Retreat so I thought I would try this one out.  I am so glad that I did.  Colleen has a way of writing a character where you are ingulfed in their lives and are rooting for them, loving them, and wondering what the heck they were thinking at the same time.<br />I will say that the subject matter was a bit dark and I don't think that I would let a really young adult read this unless they were mature enough to completely understand the subject matter.
B009JBZH54|5.0|Nothing to say more than this was a great buy. Bought this set during the Christmas sales for my parents. They loved it!
B004I2K4E8|5.0|This is an amazing recording of an amazing concert. Both the audio and video quality are excellent and the performances are unbelievable. The \\"extra\\" recordings at the end where they reunite with the old casts are not to be missed.
B005LAII08|5.0|Nothing to say more than this was a great buy. Bought this during the Christmas sales for my parents. They loved it!
B00498XRPE|3.0|When I saw this in the theater I loved it but watching it again it is definitely dated. Recommend for people that saw the original when it was first released.
B001UV4XIS|5.0|I adored the Harry Potter series. This is the very last installment of this franchise and it does not disappoint.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Best App game I ever played. Very good game and very enjoyable! Use it on my kindle and galaxy 3
B0059R5Q08|5.0|In my opinion the best rendition of this story. Absolutely wonderful actors, great cinematography and it's gorgeous. Can't go wrong.

B003H6KRIE|5.0|Nothing to say more than this was a great buy. Bought this set during the Christmas sales for my parents. They loved it!
B00AA7O6QC|1.0|Not worth it. Even for action die hards, it leaves quite a bit to be desired. Plot is extremely predictable and even the cliches are lame.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|I was not sure I would like this book, but Stephen King did not disappoint. I would recommend this book.
B007ZGBZHE|5.0|I love this series.  Who knows where it will go from here - I just hope he continues to author them!
B000E1YVZU|5.0|The music is amazing.  The characters bring you in and make you love each and every one of them.  It has a powerful message.

B0058VW36U|5.0|We play the game and cant stop playing it till the battery stops working then we play with it plug in
B003O86FMW|3.0|It was a slow start. Things didn't start getting interesting till half way in. In the beginning alot of things were repetitive, things you would already know from from the 1st book.<br />But I do suggest big hunger games fans to read it anyways. I liked it, just didn't love it.
B009O2XY12|5.0|We play the game and cant stop playing it till the battery stops working then we play with it plug in
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|Pretty useful for taking notes in class. It saves so much paper and notes are available in a variety of forms.

B002PEP4SC|5.0|This book was sheer fun.  It's not great fiction, but I wasn't expecting it to be so. It reads fast, and if Richard Castle really were writing it, it would be exactly what I'd expect.  I will probably get the other books eventually.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|We play the game and cant stop playing it till the battery stops working then we play with it plug in
0062202081|5.0|Any Justin Bieber lover will love this book, it contains a lot of pictures and details about his life and his career from his own words. Amazon had it cheaper than anywhere in stores and it shipped very quickly. You will love it!

B003O86FMW|5.0|It was so good! I could not stop reading!<br />I totally reccomend this book to anyone i know!<br />Amazing and incredible
140053271X|4.0|Since I did not receive the item directly as it was a gift for my Grandaughter, but she loved it from the start & I understand does not put it down, so it must be working pretty well.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I could not put this book down for the life of me. The action and romance were never-ending always making me want to know more. A very heartfelt, yet nerveracking book.
0938045768|5.0|Anyone interested in REAL conditioning needs to read and use this approach.  It is the real deal.  This is the way to functional strength - not what most people are getting at the gym.
B003FM1MNO|5.0|I just connected my blu-day to my Amazon account and I love it. I am years behind in watching this movie series and all that I can say is, I am hooked! To be honest, I am glad I waited because now there is not waiting to watch the next one.<br /><br />Amazon movie rental/purchase options are awesome!
B002L9N4EM|2.0|Because I needed dubbed in Spanish or with Spanish subtitles on the Amazon site says Dubbed: Spanish but not true.
0767836324|2.0|Ordered new from Amazon - was shrink wrapped, but no security seal and when put in DVD player it started mid movie.  Played fine, but feel mis-led by Amazon
B0058YPGSY|5.0|My brother is a huge fan of the show.  I have purchased all 4 seasons and he loves to re-watch them.  Now it will be my turn to watch the show.
B00AMBH70S|4.0|I enjoyed the Bourne sequels and this one is just as good. Is this the end ... who knows, but I enjoyed the ride. However, we kept wondering if Jason would make a cameo somewhere, which would have been nice just to see that he was watching, but no one saw him kinda thing. If you liked the other films you will like this one as well.
B0053O89WY|5.0|I just love this show was not to crazy about it in the first season but actually got the first season from net flix and kept watching it for about a week and ending up starting to like the show and started watching reg and finally figured the show out sheldon is def my favorite and johnny g loved him on roseanne hes a good actor i hope they continue the show its a funny show i will be continue to watch and buy seasons has they come out
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|This application is so easy to use! It allows me to capture moments and record thoughts and pertinent information instantly. This is a must have for anyone who needs to sync information between devices without a hassle.
B006LSZECO|4.0|Interesting plot with unexpected turns. It would probably make an interesting action / thriller movie.<br />However, it is rather unrealistic...
B004QX07G4|2.0|I didn't love this book because I felt this book paled to her previous books.  It wasn't very funny and lacked the charming and sweet humour that we all love Ellen for.
B009H442DG|3.0|I bought this for my wife for Christmas because Grease is her all time favorite movie. However after listening to the cd, her comment was that she was hoping that Travolta and Newton-John would have sung more than one song. She was surprised when I told her that they were on the whole album, because it features so many other artists and their voices get lost in the mix. Overall it was not what she hoped for, Danny and Sandy in December, instead it was just an average Christmas cd.
B007EECSFA|4.0|I loved this book because it was beautifully written and it told a very intereting and wonderful story.  I also loved the shift from the present to the historical time of World War Two.
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|this gamenis a lot of fun... and so damn Addicting. I wish the coins didn't go so fast. and the coin shoot needs.to be a little wider. all in all I'm giving it 4 stars
0593070720|5.0|This was a gift item, but one I'll be borrowing. The book looks interestingly written, and it's McFly -- all the better.  Just glad to have finally received it, made 2 trys - 2 different companies, this one was best -- delivered ahead of schedule.
B00914JWSW|2.0|Babs, ge back in the studio and wow us with new material.<br />Kinda blah and very old style-wise. Sorry I spent the money on this one.It just sits there and we only listened to it twice and had the same opinion. Get back in the studio and show us what we remember! Sorry...
B007UR1OHO|3.0|If the characters were not these two amazing actors, the movie would have not been very good.<br /><br />They definitely knew what they were doing when they put these two together.<br /><br />All in all i guess you get what you expected.<br /><br />Wouldn't watch again.
B000PMG16U|4.0|This was just what I wanted.  The package came quick and without a flaw.  Just note that this Blu-ray set does not have the special feature discs.
B009329Y30|5.0|Love Love Love this movie. Great choice of actors and actresses. Just amazing!!!!!!!!!!!!<br /><br />Would definitely recommend and watch again and again.
B007T7MIR0|4.0|The viewer works just fine.  We needed it to view .xlsx and .docx files.  It does the job as expected.
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|This us so much fun I found that I have become addicted to it. I can't put it down and find myself playing it at every spare min<br />ute. I have downloaded other mahjong games but this is the best of all of them.

B0094BB4TW|5.0|Had problems at first on my 1st gen fire.  After getting the new Fire HD noticed that the app looked different and worked good.  Then noticed that there were 2 FB icons on my cloud.  Looking closely noticed that the icons were slightly different.  Unistalled both versions from device (with the HD you can easily remove from cloud as well) otherwise go to your account and delete the cloud app from there.  Went back to app store and repurchased (free)  on all my kindles. now works great on 1st gen and HD.  Hope this helps.
B00APACSJG|5.0|Good, well-written mystery/science fiction story with reasonably clever twists and turns. I never get tired of Miles. He is a wonderful character.

B0063GORYU|5.0|It's a very challenging form of solitaire especially if you play with 4 decks. You always try to better yourself and earn more points than the last time.
B0077SGMXM|5.0|I love this game, its very challenging and addictive at the same time, makes you think a bit...Fun fun fun
B0063IH60K|3.0|Its a good way to pass some time, nothing special, I would definitely recommend Spider Solitaire for a more challenging game.

B00867GHS8|5.0|Our entire family loves Finding Nemo - and we really loved watching it on Blu-Ray.  The movie is beautiful to watch over and over again.  Great for the entire family.

B009SJ3GUK|5.0|This show is mysterious, dark, and compelling. I love the way they tie everything in together. So far, I am have only made it to episode 10, but I can't wait for a third season. Great show!
B005V2EVBQ|5.0|Provide good protection for the Kindle.  Much better price than many other covers.  I would recommend it to anyone wanting a good quality cover at a good price.
145162445X|5.0|Dr. Lawrence lays out his argument beautifully, what a great read. I love science and appreciate when a complex topic is explained, without pulling punches or talking down to the average reader, yet is easy to understand. This is a book I will absolutely read more than once. For pure entertainment, I do not know of it's equal. This author clearly appreciates the hard work and contributions of other scientists, he sounds like a fan of science.
B00846REIS|4.0|Although my many people said this was a spitting image of Fifty Shades of Grey, I thought it had its own tale. Similar story lines yes, but overall it was good. I plan on reading the second and look forward to it!!!
B0063IH60K|4.0|don't like the ads you have to view at the end of each game<br />otherwise it is a fun and easy game
B005LAII8A|5.0|It's not often Hollywood spits out anything original (these days anyway). But whenever that oppurtunity presents itself, I am on it, and let me tell you, I loved this movie. Everything about it was awesome, the story (very different, I think), the acting (JGL - enough said!), just everything. I liked the interesting, yet complex nature of the whole time travel concept. I saw it in the theaters, and I told myself when it comes out on DVD, OWN IT! So I checked to find out the date it was to be released DVD, bought it, have watched 3 times so far. Love it, love it, love it. Like I said, it's not everyday Hollywood greenlights anything with substance and quality, but when they do, I'll be there in line buying my ticket and/or the DVD. Great movie :)
B002MQYOFW|4.0|Saw the movie before reading and I was still engulfed in the story. Can't wait to start reading the next one.
B009VB7QQA|5.0|I can totally see this movie teaching kids some historical things while holding their interest and making it fun!!! Great movie actually going to buy a copy!
B007JMW46U|4.0|I liked this book because it has some of the stories that make this book as good as a book needs to be. I liked this book because the stories were great and the characters actions were unforgettably amazing.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Lots going on. Great book. I recommend this book for any adventurer. My review should not be under such scrutiny.
B000W0DE7O|4.0|I love this DVD and watch it over and over again since I received it during the Holiday.  I plan to purchase more Simply Red concert DVD's.  This band is great!
B00846REIS|5.0|I got this series because I'm not a reader at all but loved 50, so far it has done the same as far as unable to put down but not as much as 50 .there is a lot almost to many similarities I think still a very good read.
0553801473|5.0|Pulls some.. of the major players into life.  No real end but is there ever an end-we all know that answer No.<br />Struggles for the THRONE- and the those in power the struggles intwined in daily life are made to seem real. George Martin keeps the epic battle going in the Game for the Throne proving that those who play are the double headed nickle in life. Power creates thrist so stay thristy friends-I borrowed that idea. Keep it coming!!
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This is a great game my son put it on my kindle. He's good at it. It's very addictive. I think I play it more than he does.
B001F6TXME|3.0|Its works great, but I wish I had shopped around for a wireless remote release cord as this is useless if you want to take group portraits with yourself included without having to use the timer. I was foolish to think that this is the only cord available. The 1 meter  (about 3 feet) is too short.

B0009I7O7U|3.0|I had not heard of John Legend until I heard a song being played on the Weather Channel that caught my attention. It was &#34;I Will Stay With You.&#34;  I looked up the phrase (lyrics) online and found John Legend was the singer. I purchased the CD. The rest of the CD was not much to my liking, but I loved that particular song and don't regret buying the CD.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This book was great even though I had already seen the movie! I am definitely going to read the other two.
B00074CBIS|5.0|This is one of my favorite top 10 movies! It's stupid, funny and filled with all the things I love in a comedy. Action, Fast Cars, Jokes and scenes that are so stupid they crack you up.  This was definitely one I had to have in my movie collection.
0955153077|1.0|It doesn't matter what the book has to offer because the text is so faint and small and includes so much unnecessary chatter that reading it is exhausting. Also, so much is crammed on the pages that many of the illustrations are difficult to view. Save your money. If you want to learn photoshop or any other Adobe program spend $25 a month subscribing to Lynda.com.

B003NFM3JK|4.0|My students loved it, it had a great message. The only problem was that some of the scenes were too dark and hard to see.
B0052VUNHC|5.0|Couldn't put it down, bought it about 8 months ago and just read it for a second time.  The characters are so real, Imperfections and all. I am totally in love with the male lead and the female leads remind me of my friends. Thanks JM for an awesome grin.
B005I6EU48|3.0|but it's not been very durable at all.  The edges have frayed and the finish is rubbed off on them.  It doesn't have a closure option (like an elastic strap such as the Incipio covers have).<br /><br />I've had this cover for a bit over a year, and while as I said I love the \\"book look\\", I'm replacing it with an Incipio cover - a solider, if less \\"bookish\\" option.

0307592731|3.0|I think this book was well written, but the same end could have been accomplished with far fewer pages.  The journey along the Pacific Crest Trail is well worth reading, with its story of redemption and grit on Cheryl's walk to be enjoyed by both men and women.  The reader should not view this as a &#34;chic&#34; book, as it is not.

1596434252|5.0|My 3-year old son LOVES this book. The book is probably a bit delicate for his age, as he sometimes does not have the patience for the intricacies of turning the pages properly. (We already had to repair the letter G page.)

B00AA7O22U|3.0|Product has good action but conversation are dull and unnecessarily violent such as cutting off the head of a dead enemy.
B002BWP49M|4.0|I liked this movie because I enjoy the Twilight franchise. Those trying to watch this independently might not have the same feelings. It's incredibly cheesy and tremendously far-fetched, even considering the whole vampire/werewolf thing.
B00138F080|4.0|Really didn't catch these guys at all when they first became popular, but wasn't able to escape their music. Overall this album is a bit too far reaching and doesn't quite get there with all the tracks. I understand wanting to touch on all your influences but a few of these track seem like just bad ideas.
0060873175|1.0|I've long been a fan of Michael Crichton's works and was incredibly sad when he passed several years ago, so I was pleasantly surprised to stumble upon this book while in a drugstore one day. I bought it and began reading it as soon as I got home, excited to once again lose myself is one of Crichton's works.<br /><br />To say I was hugely disappointed is an understatement.<br /><br />One of my favorite things about Crichton's works has always been how he manages to take complex scientific ideas and break them down enough so the average reader can understand them, but without quite seeming to just dumb them down. He can somehow make even the most fantastical situations seem plausible with his explanations, almost making you forget that it's only fiction. There is virtually NO actual science present in 'Micro'. The premise of the plot - that the protagonists get shrunk down to microscopic size and let loose in the wilds of Hawaii - is basically explained as \\"we shrink things with electromagnetic-something-or-other\\". And that's it. There's no attempt to actually explain in detail how it works or how it relates to our own actually existing technology, which Crichton was excellent at. There's just that brief moment of \\"explanation\\" and then that's it for the rest of the book.<br /><br />Perhaps my biggest beef with the entire novel was the way the characters were written, or rather, weren't. I've sometimes seen Crichton criticized for somewhat using stock characters, which I agree with to an extent, but he still always managed to flesh them out so that they had personalities beyond their given archetypes. The characters presented in 'Micro' are absurdly flat and lacking in anything resembling actual character. From the beginning, you can easily fit them into their stereotype niche - The Jerk, The Strong Woman, The Cynic, The Hero - and they never progress beyond that. There are several grotesque deaths throughout the novel, but honestly, I never actually felt impacted bythem, because I cared so little about the characters. And why should I, when they're utterly flat and bland? In particular, the antagonist is absolutely laughable, simply because he reads like a joke of a mad scientist. There's no subtext to what any of the characters do, either, because they completely lay everything out for you in their dialogue, which is incredibly stilted and beyond obvious throughout the entire novel. It reads like the incredibly rough first draft of a college student's screenplay, not what I'd expect of a veteran novelist.<br /><br />There's also just no suspense throughout the entire novel, because the writing in general is just so bland and obvious. The characters reveal pretty much everything, leaving nothing to the imagination, and I felt like there were no real surprises the entire novel. Again, even the most gruesome death scenes lacked impact, because you say them coming a mile away.<br /><br />I've never read any of Richard Preston's work, so I can't specifically comment on what his contribution to the novel was, though I've seen several other reviewers say he's an great writer in his own right. But what I can say is that this is absolutely NOT a Michael Crichton novel. Even in his earlier days, Crichton never wrote so clumsily, with such an amateur grasp of characterization and simple story building. It's been a long while since I've had to struggle through a novel so much, but reading 'Micro' was practically painful. I literally forced myself to finish it, just so I could see if my predictions for how everything would end were right (they were). If I could return this book and get my money back, I would.<br /><br />Save your money and go pick up one of Crichton's earlier works that he actually wrote.
0375869026|5.0|As a special educator, this book does a great job of sharing what people in schools and homes experience.  This provides a starting point for questioning some of our actions in relation to students who do not fit.  Schools create certain expectations that exclude students unintentionally.

B0094BB4TW|5.0|The Kindle Fire Facebook application is great! I really enjoy having this application at my finger tips! It is Great!!
B008MG1E4A|5.0|Regardless of the negative press received about this book, it is a excellent firsthand account of the raid which Targeted Osama bin Laden. Other reports/movie accounts have not been as accurate as this, having been written by someone inside the compound that night.<br />Working up to that particular raid was a descriptive chronology of other raids and the extensive amount of training required and the discipline necessary to reach the elite status that the author obtained.<br />I was amazed at the amount of things that went wrong during the raid but the elaborate contingency plans that were made to make the raid a success.

B007NZDES0|5.0|I attended the first &#34;Bring Me Home&#34; show that Sade had in the US and it was the best show I've ever been to.  I knew after I left the show that I would be buy the DVD when her tour was over.  Nothing compares to the live show but I do have to say that they did a great job making you feel as if you're in the concert.  I definitely recommend this DVD.
B005LAIGYQ|4.0|entertaining  good . hollywood special effects detracted from the movie. should have stuck with the seals and actual weapons capability.

B00005214X|5.0|But I never got the droid. I did get my money refunded. I ordered sevral gift cards and while complaining about the droid the gift cards got cancelled. I was unable to have them delivered to my brother. Everything came to me.
1451627289|4.0|I devoured this book in 3 days because I had to know what would happen next...and even if the ending was a tad corny I completely fell in love with the Land of Ago described in this book.<br /><br />The premise of a generation X teacher going back in time to save JFK seemed a little shaky since people my age do not really relate to that event, but after Jake journeys to 1958 the novel becomes amazing.  All the details about the 50s and 60s way of life that no one considers, like banks doing everything by hand or mills belching toxic smoke, plus the trusting nature and general niceness of people back then.  King does let you know it was far from a fairytale land of happy times, especially in Dallas, but overall it made me want to travel back through the rabbit hole too.<br /><br />Now about the romance with Sadie: it was a bit unbelievable and the sex scenes were too much.  I liked Sadie but she is too perfect and Jake is too perfectly matched with her, and the sex is too perfect and Jake saves the day too often.  If you want to read a more realistic portrayal of a couple read The Shining, but in all fairness I did not think this Sadie-Jake romance ruined the book.  The whole time I was picturing Sadie to be Geena Davis too.<br /><br />The ending...could have been less cutesy.  Again, this did not ruin the book for me but it cost it one star of review.
0545265355|5.0|great story and the boxed set was a hit for my daughter's birthday. it is always economical to purchase a set.
B007M45PMU|5.0|Love this album! Probably one of my new favorite bands. Not much more to say, just reaching the word limit with this stuff now.
B008Z9YLV2|4.0|A great movie to go along with the book. As a parent I appreciate the way the movie producers handled the violence parts.
B00APUYN0I|4.0|Great film to watch with my 11 year old, not too sophisticated and nothing she shouldn't see! Great singing too
B0070Y46UY|3.0|I read Life of Pi before movie. Still have not seen movie. I'm curious how they made a movie from this book, as it doesn't have a lot of substance for a movie. I'm assuming the movie will have to add a lot to make it entertaining. As a book, it was just a story. The end had no meaning for me. It didn't wrap anything up. If the movie is better, I would unfortunately have to recommend the movie over the book.
B001UV4XIS|5.0|Polyjuice potion, unforgiveable curses, flying on the backs of dragons and more this movie has it all.  Still there were a few little details left out but overall a great way to end the series.
B006P0FIB0|5.0|This movie is not a tradition rendering of the Three Musketeers and has a series of twists on comedy/action feel to it makes it a Three Musketeers for the modern age. Overall it was fun on the story/characters with great 3 D picture effects.

B0041KVW2K|5.0|After I had ordered this set I spent days and days going crazy reading about bad sound quality and about warped vinyl. Now when I have it and have listened to it (at least one song from each side of every LP) I am completely happy and satisfied.<br />To me it looks like Amazon did a perfect job: set was packed amazingly good and shipped impressively fast.<br />Couple of words about the content: (music of course is out of discussion) it is a dream which became real. Book is good (I wouldn't care about the book, frankly speaking, it is nothing new to an experienced fan :). But the LPs are wonderful, I have absolutely nothing to complain about. Sound is good, I used \\"Sun King\\" track to compare new vinyl to the other vinyl that I have. The new sounds better!

B000PEX1IE|4.0|Since my younger boys had watched the Star Wars series with us, we thought a PG rating from the mid-80s was probably going to be fine.  The littlest one wanted to see the &#34;ghosts&#34;!.  Not a high number of &#34;ghosts&#34;.  They were disappointed.  And the end is just too scary for most under at least 8.  My entire set of  boys (8 and under) hid under the covers.  &#34;possessed&#34; people are hard to explain.  This was a relive for my husband/me - but would have been better to watch after they went to bed.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|This is one of the best books I've ever read. I recommend it to anyone, it is a spectacular book.
0525952926|5.0|One of his best! I can't wait for the third book to come out later this year. Would definitely recommend.
B006LSZECO|3.0|This book had the potential to be good.  However it ended the worst possible way.  There were so many ways it could've ended, I wonder why the author chose this one.
B0027MJU00|5.0|Another dark mystery by Gillian Flynn.  The story of the youngest survivor of a horrible crime against her family.  With twists and turns and the arrest of her brother, Libby Day has scars.  The story begins with a grown up Libby and all her feelings exposed.  A series of incidents allows her the courage to finally seek the truth about that night.  The characters are believable and as we get to know them, you begin to wonder about who really committed the crime.  I guessed it toward the end but it didn't take away from a well written story.  I like Sharp Objects better but this one is right up there!
B001IYCMNA|2.0|I've been building computer networks for over 25 years. This is the strangest device I've ever dealt with. If you had asked me to review it in the first 12 months, I would have given it 5 stars for the feature set, range, and price. It did everything it was supposed to and worked reliably.<br /><br />Then one day it starting having the reliability issues mentioned in the other reviews and in an extensive set of messages on the Small Business Forum. At random, it stops passing wireless traffic. In my case, it was infrequent - about once every few days. Once it stopped working, it could be fixed by a reset, or just re-saving any of the wireless settings. The strange thing is that everything was stable when this starting happening - no configuration changes, no firmware upgrades, not even a power outage that I'm aware of. Perhaps it was triggered by interference with a new access point belonging to a neighbor. Maybe the hardware just went bad. But it is curious that the symptoms are similar to what many other owners describe.<br /><br />I worked with Cisco Support over many days to try to fix it. Just when we thought it was working, it would fail again.<br /><br />In any case, it lasted beyond the warranty so was not eligible for replacement.
B0057LUI0O|5.0|The story is very uplifting and the music and graphics are entertaining. My 17 month old daughter loves this movie.
B004G5ZY7E|5.0|I have enjoyed other Harry Hole mysteries by Nesbo but have been spacing them out so that there is always one available. I am happy I waited for this one as I began it during winter break in New England and Nesbo had me enthralled once again with the dysfunctional characters. I have spent time in Bergen and Oslo and I enjoy the visualizations that stories help me retrieve from my memory. I found myself not wanting to put down the book...I will hold myself back from the next book and treat them like a high quality chocolate that I enjoy in small doses.

1451695195|5.0|We all have different perspectives in this life, so of course we'll have different perspectives in the next (influenced by this life and its perspective).  As such, I very much appreciated Dr Alexander's frank portrayal of his life experience and his unique perspectives for both lives.  He gets deep (and yet, he explains, 'shallow') enough to share his fundamental changes in consciousness awareness, personal worth, important people in his life (adoptive parents, birth mom, siblings, mediums, family friends, colleagues, clergy), and his personal struggles and learning as well as his personal life mission as he has come to understand it.<br /><br />As a fellow human being and contemporary living soul I appreciated this opportunity to 'get to know' him and followed up by investigating his website, prior writings, and other biographical information (his great grandfather helped to re-establish the Olympics!).<br /><br />I sensed from his writing the unconditional and universal love that he had/has felt and communicated both in his writing and his ongoing efforts.  My only desire now is to be able to connect with him more so as to gain greater mutual understanding because of all of the wonderfully serendipitous connections in all of our lives - from the oddly included description by his birth mom of the crescent moon and Jupiter at the time of his birth (the same thing was a monumental part of the night I met my adopted daughter - who was born the same day Dr Alexander left the hospital), to scriptural stories that closely resemble his ongoing experience (Mosiah 27 - yes, I'm a Mormon and that chapter took on new meaning for me after reading this book), to the deeply curious placement of Christ in Dr Alexander's life and his STE (Spiritually Transformative Event) and what I've learned in other readings, including [[ASIN:1609070461 What's on the Other Side? - What the Gospel Teaches Us about the Spirit World]] and [[ASIN:1889025046 The Message]] (I'm curious after reviewing his bibliography as to how 'East Coast' the sources seem to be, especially in the religious/spiritual titles - and I look forward to more openness to all experiences).<br /><br />His experience and book are definitely motivating action and reaction as 'Om' desired in providing this experience to the benefit of all of us - I'm enjoying reading the constant reviews and recognizing the personal reactions that we are all blessed, through free agency, to have and express.  I, for one, will keep learning, acting, and sharing - and I hope and know Dr Alexander will do the same.ng his bibliography as to how 'East Coast' the sources seem to be, especially in the religious/spiritual titles - and I look forward to more openness to all experiences).<br /><br />His experience and book are definitely motivating action and reaction as 'Om' desired in providing this experience to the benefit of all of us - I'm enjoying reading the constant reviews and recognizing the personal reactions that we are all blessed, through free agency, to have and express.

B00A6PD9I4|2.0|Wanted to watch Monsters Inc on amazon instant play but it was temporarily unavailable, probably due to the fact that its currently in theaters. So my boyfriend and I settled on this since the comedian Craig Ferguson was one of the voice actors in it, so we expected it to be funny. If you're a 20 year old couple, I don't recommend it. There were some funny moments but it was very slow moving and not what we were looking for. If you want a Disney Pixar movie that's also entertaining, watch Ratatouille!
B0042RJWTC|4.0|I haven't viewed it yet so I can't attest to the quality of the product , however it arrived quickly and in what appears to be great condition.

B007TNS6JI|3.0|This game is versatile and fun but I wish it had a way to earn gems instead of paying real money for them.
034580404X|5.0|It was the best books I have read in a long time! I couldn't stop reading I hope they make more
B007XKEY6Q|1.0|It worked for maybe the first 2 days &amp; it hasn't worked since! Very disappointed. It still works on my phone. So what's the deal?
B005GY0Y8S|3.0|The entire book I felt like something was off. I can't decide if this was cleverly written that way so that the reader knows something is wrong before the main character does.  Didn't like the feeling that I was lost and missing some important piece but good idea.
0316228532|5.0|As I started to read the book, I found it dull and boring, as it was mostly speaking of Polotics, but as I continued to read it, I found myself captivated by the story, and by some of the characters, such as Krystal Weedon and Gia Bawden. I wanted to see where these characters would go, and found myself enjoying the book so much more when I was about half way through as I realised it was not all about Polotics.
B009YP9L7U|4.0|Witty. Fun. A good light read for someone looking for a romance mixed with discovery of one's self. Glad I read it.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I started reading this book wondering if I would end up like most of the other reviewers who thoroughly enjoyed this book. I tried a sample so I wouldn't be stuck with a lame book and by the last page of the sample I was hooked. I instantly bought this book and read for hours straight.<br /><br />The way this book first captures you is amazing with this rebel like main character who is absolutely lovely and funny. Everything flowed so smoothly and not once did I skip a paragraph or two to just get past the boredom I get with most other novels I read.<br /><br />All in all I thought that the book was amazing for the first two thirds of it and I couldn't put my IPad down until I was forced into doing something else. Towards the last third I felt like the author indulged me into way too many emotions and commotions in the book that I felt like it was getting cheesy. (This is how I feel about most teen books that have some romance or a lot of romance to them.) That's when I started to skip sentences and whatever else that didn't seem to keep me interested just so I could get closer to the end or just excited about what I was reading again.<br /><br />The first half of the book is written very well and then all of a sudden I'm thinking no no no in my head because I wasn't happy anymore with how everything turned out after feeling like I was completely in love with this fairy tale.<br /><br />Regardless of how I felt towards the end, but not the entire end, I will still say this book is a must read. So many twists and turns and shocking points but everything making you fall in love with this adorable couple.
B0095P31L6|5.0|I've seen this movie five or six times and still catch something new each viewing.  It is so clever and so funny.<br />One of my top ten favorites in the last ten years.

B005WUHAX8|1.0|My 15 year old son bought this case thinking that it would protect our new iphone we just got for Christmas from breaking.  My iphone in the protective lifeproof case was on the kitchen table.  I accidently knocked it off with my purse on to my Kitchen floor and my screen cracked.  Take it from me don't waste your money on a lifeproof case! It's a waste of your money, time and a joke cause they don't warranty your phone one bit just another case within 90 days of purchase if the case is somehow damaged!

B00AFEXRME|4.0|This movie isn't an action pack movie - not at all. Instead this movie is more of a story about the life of the pilot after the amazing landing, he did after the plane failed in mid-air. It is said that no pilot could had done what he did. They even tested that many times with many different pilot in the simulator.<br /><br />The movie is a slow peace movie there is no action but just talking after the landing of the airplane. And, all the of the major action scenes will be in the beginning, so you can just get up and leave after the crash, if you just wanted an action movie. Please, leave now.<br /><br />Now, for the rest of you that are still willing to learn what happens to a pilot after a big crash, you will be pleasantly surprised. This movie can be very entertainment, if you give it a chance. You can get into the movie earlier on and enjoy finding out a little by little who is this pilot and how he could had done his amazing landing? You will find out that later, after a big crash, there is a court case and hearing for the pilot. The hearing is to see if the pilot is responsible for the crash or was it something else?<br /><br />The movie does a great job trying to build up to the final climax for the court appearance. At the appearance is where, the pilot future will be. Would the pilot ever fly again? Will he go to jail? Will he just skip and leave the country? These are the things you will find out, if you watch this movie.<br /><br />I did enjoy the movie and I do recommend this movie.
B008DM4OTA|5.0|My little girl loves to play this game, it keeps her interested and it is very user friendly for toddlers, I am really glad we downloaded this.
6305511055|5.0|Based on the novel Six Days of the Condor by James Grady, the timeframe is accelerated in the film adaptation, Three Days of the Condor (1975), a masterful 70's suspense thriller, directed by Sidney Pollack (The Frim, [[ASIN:B000JLTR8G The Yakuza]], Tootsie).  Robert Redford ([[ASIN:B00008MTVY Brubaker]], [[ASIN:B00008MTW1 The Hot Rock]], [[ASIN:B001EHLUDY The Natural]], Spy Game, The Sting, The Way We Were) plays a CIA employee, who unexpectedly has to draw on all that he has learned, in order to keep himself alive.<br /><br />Joseph Turner (Redford) works for a CIA unit assigned to glean through books and periodicals looking for signs of anything nefarious or suspicious.  Operating out of a low profile office in New York City, Turner leaves the building to get lunch for his co-workers.  When he returns, finds that they have all been shot dead.<br /><br />Following protocol, a shaken Turner phones the CIA, and identifies himself by his codename \\"Condor\\".  Eventually he speaks to deputy director Higgins (Cliff Robertson), who arranges a meeting to bring Turner into headquarters.  The rendezvous in a back alley turns out to be a double-cross, but the bookwormish Condor manages to shoot his would be assassin.<br /><br />Desperate, and in need of a place to hide, Turner abducts a woman named Kathy Hale (Faye Dunaway), and forces her to take him to her home.  Turner later ties Kathy up, and leaves to visit someone that he feels may be in danger.  On this excursion he meets Joubert (Max von Sydow), the leader of the hit squad that murdered his friends.  Joubert is there to kill him, but Turner's remarkable instincts for survival once again saves his life, and eventually leads to his uncovering the truth.<br /><br />Three Days of the Condor is a brilliant mix of violence, paranoia, and intrigue, that fits perfectly within context of the cover-ups and political dirty tricks of the Watergate era.  The dialog is sharp, and always appropriate.  The story is nicely paced, and mostly stays within the bounds of reality, with the major weak point perhaps being the relationship that so quickly develops between Hale and Turner, as she becomes an overly willing ally.  With an amazing ability to put the pieces together, and adapt to various situations, Turner is someone that you get totally behind.<br /><br />The cast is loaded with Academy Award winners and nominees.  Robert Redford gives a brilliant and believable performance, as a desperate and resourceful, man on the run.  The perfectly cast Max von Sydow ([[ASIN:B001992NW4 The Exorcist]], The Quiller Memorandum), is fabulous.  Faye Dunaway ([[ASIN:B002VWNIAE Bonnie and Clyde]], Network, Chinatown, The Thomas Crown Affair, [[ASIN:B004DFQ6SI The Eyes Of Laura Mars]]) demonstrates again why she was one of the top actresses of her era.  Cliff Robertson (Man on a Swing) is solid as a CIA company man, while John Houseman (The Paper Chase) has a small supporting role.<br /><br />Lacking the pyrotechnics of a modern thriller, Three Days of the Condor may seems a bit tame, and the film's ambiguous ending may not completely satisfy, but the story plays out in a very realistic manner for 1975, again harkening back to Watergate, where the efforts of Washington Post reporters Carl Bernstein and Bob Woodward, eventually led to the resignation of a President.mostly stays within the bounds of reality, with the major weak point perhaps being the relationship that so quickly develops between Hale and Turner, as she becomes an overly willing ally.

B00APUYWYA|5.0|This was a really pleasant surprise. Basically a college \\"Glee,\\" but the writing was sharp, clever and laugh out loud funny.
B004G600A4|5.0|My Daughters loved this movie. The movie was funny and cute. They watched it over and over again. The ending was great!
B004J4WKTW|4.0|This was a fun read and took me far away from my everyday life.  Great imaginative descriptions of behaviors and settings.
0425252868|5.0|If you enjoy history, aviation, military history, human struggle and triumph. Then this book is a must read. You will be hooked by the end of the first chapter. Wonderfully written.
034580404X|2.0|I bought this on some peoples choices-- I would not have usually bought this kind of book--have not read much of even the 1st.
0811879542|5.0|Our grandchildren (ages 2 and 5) &#34;read&#34; this book over and over and over. The 5 year old is just as entertained as the little one. It's fun!

B00AP9RQE4|5.0|Ivan deserved a story of his own and, thankfully, that one is simply great.<br />If you enjoy the Vorkosigan saga - you will love this book.
B009186JYI|4.0|I enjoy seeing them when they fist started out and they had some great live music, My whole family liked it, even my Grandkids.
B007Z9QWVK|5.0|Was phenominal....need to watch it again....loved it - love her - love the out takes too - very informative, and interesting.
B006G2124E|4.0|Read the book; the movie does not take away from the book.<br />Enjoyed the movie.  Streaming from Amazon worked well; we &#34;downloaded&#34; the movie and we were watching it within 5 minutes of picking it from the great line up.  Would have preferred to rent it rather than buy it so that is kind of a bummer, but oh well.
B00A9X9TIW|5.0|Best sci-fi I've seen in a while. Bruce Willis and Gorden-Levitt were an interesting duo and self/future self. I'll watch this one again.
B005LAIHE0|2.0|I am a fan of almost every actor in this movie, but it is just too long and quite boring.
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|I love to play Draw Something every night! I even purchased the full game, it was worth it! I only wish More of my friends would play! Some of the people can draw really well! it is fun to see what they do next.
B0043RSK3K|4.0|I found this book to be very true to history mostly (although there are a few facts that can be disputed).  A great read for history gluttons or just someone who wants to catch up somewhat.  I did learn a few things that really blew me away and when I checked - they were right.  For example: We did drop the bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki AFTER the Japanese were negotiating a surrender.  This book was slanted to the left mostly though.  A very liberal read although attempts were made to be more moderate.  Whatever your politics, I would still recommend this book.
B004EBT5CU|5.0|I love Adele's voice and she has so much emotion when singing her songs.  I can't wait for her next release.
1451695195|4.0|This tome was recommended by my Family Doctor after my recent minor heart attack.<br />Once you get past the MD. jargon.<br />I can't get through a chapter without my eyes raining so much, I can barely read the text.<br />Interesting view from an MD. Neurosurgeon.  I appreciate Amazon's quick response.
B00APUYWYA|4.0|This was a fun movie to watch with friends. Great singing and songs! It definitely had some funny parts. It's a good movie to just sit back and relax to - will definitely watch it again :)
B001KDQ4KQ|5.0|It is amazing how something so tragic can seem disturbing and magical at the same time. I really got into the book but not because I liked it. I felt the pain and anxiety of the characters. It's in it's own category of books for me.
B002VPE1WK|4.0|I got this backpack in a promotion and I am really glad I did! It definitely does the job it needs to well. Has different movable compartments inside along with pockets and two outside zipped up pockets. The shoulder pads are very comfortable and it comes with a clip for around the waist. Sturdy material that keeps my precious camera and lens safe!
B0054R6BFM|4.0|I read this book at the suggestion of an online book club. I was fascinated by the subject. Jay sucks you in from the beginning. It only took me just a few days to read. Although it may seem depressing it is also insightful. Great read.
B004I744AS|5.0|when I change into offline mode it download all definition words and you can use it any time in anywhere!
B005HSG3TC|3.0|I was hoping this case was like mine with both sides hard.  Unfortunately, this one is only hard on one side and the cover folds to allow it to sit in different positions.  Not exactly what I was wanting.
B008Y1YJ90|5.0|This movie has the true holiday spirit and has become a favorite in our home.  It was a better deal buying thru amazom than in stores.
B005XLN77O|5.0|I bought this for one of my nieces for Christmas.  She loves it!  Barbies have always been her favorite and to be able to design the clothes is an added bonus. The fabric is lightweight but durable and easy to draw on.  They don't include enough dresses though...only 4.  She finished these pretty quickly.  You can buy refills but I think they are a bit overpriced for what you get.  Overall...it's Barbie, and you get to design her clothes...what little girl wouldn't love that!
B004UFEJXK|5.0|This movie was a great value compaired to what my local stores offered. This is a new favorite movie for my son
B000FA675C|5.0|Always wanted to read this book and I now understand why.  The history buff in me was amazed at everything that Brown wrote. Amazing novel that kept me up to get to the next page. Looking forward to more Robert Langdon!!
B000GW8RX4|1.0|Poor quality DVD with lines running through it on and off throughout the entire 2 hours of video.  I would suggest a remake of it before you try and sell it to the public.

B003VS0CX8|5.0|an old favorite of the family, now it looks great and sounds awesome after finally retiring the old vhs copy.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|I honestly can't stop playing this game. Docked a star for the fact that if you are trying to get perfect on a level and fat finger it can force you to start the entire level over. This is mainly a problem on the larger boards which are recommended for tablet but I still play on my Droid Razr Maxx, so really not a big issue. Definitely recommend.
1603427244|5.0|My cast on and cast off are always different, so the other options are really very helpful. Would consider other books.
0307987698|5.0|I purchased this book as well as the original to read to my daughter. She loves them. I highly recommend them.
B00AFCEIB0|1.0|I found this to be a ridiculous format. It takes me three times longer to find subject  searched than if I use standard browser. Maybe it's operator error, but what good is an app that complicated?
037582913X|5.0|I enjoyed this classic book myself as a child, and now my daughter can too! Much like all of the little golden books, this is a wholesome, good read to share with your kid.
B009IEXKXI|5.0|This is a compelling read and one of the best Sci Fi books I have read in many years. Well worth the purchase price.
B000S5NMW0|5.0|What can I say, the Swiss always make things of the highest quality! They don't even compare to your run-of-the mill colored pencils. We don't use any other brand!
B00AFCEIB0|1.0|Thank you for the download but I cannot find it either on my mobile phone or Kindle - thank you for my opionion.
B0006HBZXS|5.0|The whole family liked this movie.  It was suspensful and on the edge of your seat. Many good actors are in it.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|I've enjoyed all his other books, but this one is really fun to read. Get a copy. You won't be able to put it down.
B00AAX68HG|5.0|very fun game better than cut the rope I would highly reccomend this game to any member of the family
1587613379|5.0|Obsessed with this book, couldn't put it down. Glad I finally bought it and Iwould recommend it to anyone I know.
B008133MDK|5.0|Wonderful modernization of the Sherlock stories. This show is literally the best serialized television available at this time. Ordinarily, I dislike modernizations of &#34;period&#34; work, but this one works perfectly.
B009LDXQGW|5.0|Thanks to Spotify i got to hear the entire album before I literally RAN off to buy it. I made a copy to have one at home and one in my car. All 3 discs are amazing but the 1st discis on constant play. SEXIEST album EVER. PERID!
B007H7XJD4|1.0|Gratuitous violence; skewed world view.  Definitely not for kids!  The chaos of the gods and humans portrayed here is not something to elevate as worth imitating.
B004EBZX6W|5.0|I wish they would make this for iOS.<br />It helped me to optimize my wifi network which was beyond my expectations!
B003YL4LYI|3.0|After book 4, I was excited to get back to the good characters, and while Dance with Dragons delivered on that front, it still meanders from plot point to plot point and barely makes any progress in the characters storylines.
B001UV4XFG|5.0|I love this saga and can't wait to own them all. Will be watching and sharing these movies with friends.
B00466HM28|4.0|I mainly create EDM style music, so I needed a midi controller to help me out. I was using TouchDAW for Android, but the latency issues and signal drops make it rather frustrating, so I started to look for some hardware that didn't cost too much, which brought me here. I wanted something portable, and this was the best I could find. I used this controller with my two main DAWs: Ableton Live 8, and FL Studio 10.<br /><br />SIZE<br />It's extremely portable, and I love that, but the key size is affected by this (more on that later). All of the buttons, pots, and pads above the keyboard are a perfectly acceptable size for me.<br /><br />THE KEYBOARD<br />I know this is supposed to be mini, and I should have expected smaller size keys, so it won't hurt my rating, but I don't necessarily like their size. I have fairly large fingers and found myself hitting two keys at a time frequently. However, they do work, and the action on them is spectacular considering how small this thing is. If you're looking for realistic action, this is the wrong place to get it. What you do get is some soft keys that have fairly good velocity control. It doesn't have a pitch or modulation wheel either, but again, this is supposed to be portable, so I understand the omission.<br /><br />THE PADS<br />As other reviewers have commented, these things are not very good, and there doesn't appear to be any way to change their sensitivity. You have to hit them with a fairly deliberate tap if you want the thing to register, and the lowest velocity I could get these things to trigger with was around the 80-90 range, which is very unfortunate. The material feels great, and I like that they light up when active, but I'm tired of pounding on the pads to get them to work. Mapping the pads in both Ableton and FL Studio (FPC) was extremely easy. There are two available banks, giving you a total of 16 pads, which is enough for most kits, but I'm still a little disappointed, as they could have added a couple extra banks to give you 32. Not a huge issue for me, but it'd be nice.<br /><br />ARPEGGIATOR<br />This is the sour grapes for me. I really like the function of an arp, but I couldn't figure out a way to sync the tempo to either DAW. Maybe it's possible, but I couldn't find anything that says how to do it. You can manually set it in the program and upload it to the thing, but that's irritating. I'd rather control it from the device, as well as be able to sync the tempo directly with the DAW. The tap tempo is a little frustrating as well. It will always set the tempo you're tapping it at, but sometimes it hits on the offbeat instead. To correct this, I tap it fast, then go back to the correct tempo to see if it fixes it. If that doesn't work, start over again. It's possible I'm not using this correctly, but I couldn't figure out another way.<br /><br />POTS<br />Not much to say about these. They're smooth, and have little resistance. I prefer a little more resistance on the pots, but they are acceptable, and work well.<br /><br />OVERALL<br />This is an excellent portable solution. The build quality is great, and it offers just enough tools to make some quick beats or melodies. If you have a full size keyboard already and are looking for something you can use on-the-go, this is a great tool. I would not recommend this for someone looking for a main midi controller at a stationary location. I am returning this and have ordered the Akai Pro MPK 49, as I feel that controller will better suit my needs as it has much more configuration, more pads, more keys, mod and pitch wheels, as well as faders. I would still recommend this to anyone looking for a portable midi controller all-in-one, but if you're getting this just for the pads, do yourself a favor and buy a nice MPC instead.
0142403873|5.0|I love the story and the pictures. I just like reading it in different voices. My 6 mo old is a bit too young for it (I just couldn't resist buying it) but loves it.
B004EPYZUS|5.0|I am a Tom Cruise fan. I have all the Mission Impossible movies.<br />I think this one was the best. I would recommend it highly.<br />Fast service. I like buying movies on Amazon. Best way to go for buying movies.
B007TNS6JI|4.0|I picked this up free so that I could try an RPG on my Kindle Fire to see if (1) I could play and (2) if I would like playing.<br /><br />I find it a little bit difficult, but that is to be expected when you are trying a new game.  I'm sure that there is a learning curve and it would get easier the more you play.<br /><br />The graphics are very good and it is a high quality game, especially when it was free.
0307887448|5.0|You only need to know three things about this book.<br /><br />1) It's fiendishly well written. A genuine page turner that practically makes you obsessive through it's incredible climatic finish<br />2) You will not be able to put it down. If you have a 'bed' time... plan on waking up later in the morning as I spent a few too many sleepless nights surging through this book.<br />3) If you like video games, pop-culture, and action in your novels... this book is up there with some of the best of the best.<br /><br />Stop what you're doing, buy this book.

B006LSZECO|5.0|it was good from beginning to end, i had a hard time putting it down.<br />When you thought you had the plot it was a surprize.
B006LSZECO|5.0|I've been burned many times by critics who love a book and I when I read it, I hate it.  Not this time.  I finished this book in a weekend (on little sleep mind you).  Great plot, so many twists and turns.  The ending caught me completely off guard.  I recommend this book to anyone who loves a good mystery/thriller.
B004DM0UII|1.0|Only able to access one foreign station sof far.<br />All other never complete pre-buffering and is very difficult to stop.
B005CRQ4GU|1.0|It was pretty good. I really liked the dance part and how his uncle was the dj. So that is why I think it's Okay. What I did not like was the chickenpox thing and the toilet paper thing. Also I did not like the beginning of the book.
B005OCFGTO|5.0|I have so many movies and have wanted to purchase this series for quite some time. I am very happy that the packaging is compact. A definite win.
0312383320|5.0|I love all of Janet Evanovich's books.  This one is just as good as all of her books and will continue to buy each and every one she writes.

B008HT4FUW|5.0|This show is so addicting, it's hard to turn it off between episodes. My husband was reluctant to watch with me but he was soon drawn in as well. Acting and story line are most excellent!!
B0091HVMVO|5.0|This re-issue of the 55 CDs from original recordings is not a copy-reissue, but an entirely new issue from original tapes, and this speaks a lot on the magnificient sound of the individual discs.<br />I owned the vinyl LP of Leppard's Brandenburg Concertos in the 1970's. It is of course a joy to see it being digitised by modern avante garde technology instead of the early and crude digital equipments.<br />The re-issue here is  vastly different from the early digitised sound, as evident in the vocal sets like 'Il Barbiere di Sivigli' by Marriner and the 'Il Corsaro' by Gardelli.  Even the 'Requiem' of Peter Schreier gets a better 'sound' than the Grammophone award winning CD originally re-issued in the 1990's.<br />So much on technology.<br />The contents are truly interesting. I do not have the good fortune as a good friend of mine who owns over 3000 vinyl LPs issued since the late-1960's.  However, there are certainly vintages in this box set that deserve much better accoustics than the hard,brittle and tinny sounds of early digitisation.  Some artists benefit particularly well from this more avante-garde transfer, as for instance the great Mexican tenor Francisco Araiza, who gets three pieces of works in this box set re-issue: the Mozart 'Requiem', the Rossini opera 'Il Barbiere', and the Rossini 'Stabat Mater'.<br />Other great musicians getting a good coverage are conductors Haitink (4 works), Colin Davis (4 works), Marriner (3 works), Gergiev (3 works), Edo de Waart (2 works), Markecitch (2 works), pianists Brendel (3 works), Kovacevich (2 works), and singers (apart from Araiza's 3 works), Norman (2 works), Ameling (2 works), and instrumentalists like Holliger (Flautist) 2 works.
B00AKL1XPU|3.0|I think that people should get the little peanut things for rewards and stuff and pay for fuel with coins...am i right?
B00APUYWYA|1.0|Pitch Perfect movie made no sense to me.  Maybe one laugh.  Waste of my time.  One star for the dance sequences.
B007GEMQ2I|5.0|Great set, so detailed, so realistic.  Buy it today, you won't be disappointed.  Wonderful for a true lego enthusiast.  :)
B0070Y46UY|5.0|Thought this was a wonderful allegory. I like how the story was unfolded and that you knew about the man before you heard the harrowing story of the boy.
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|This game started out apparently easy. However as I progressed the games became very challenging. I would recommend this game for young and the young at heart.
B004N6369Y|4.0|Sweet story.  You will feel you know the characters and can relate to their interaction.  Although this will hold your interest, there are times I was disappointed when the plots were &#34;settled too quickly.&#34; In my opinion there could have been a little more action and suspense in some situations.
B004LX0D36|4.0|If you like Pride and Prejudice by Jane Austen you will like this book. When you begin reading just dont want to put the book down until you finish reading it. I have not found one of her book bad yet, they are very creative and loving.
0446580848|3.0|Found it too long and ending too hurried.  Not his best and I have loved them all.  Is he rushing them to print?
B00122X6WY|5.0|If you like to dance this album /CD is  a classic and was revolutionary. First of all it came out in 1980 and predicted the computer world that is 2012 and beyond. Secondly their beats were original and lead the German club music explosion thru the 80's and were ripped off by rap artists in the 1990's. for under $7.00 it is a bargain download for quality music.
B001ADQXHA|4.0|Great 3 songs on the album, Title track, paradise, All reved up....PURE CLASSICS. A better deal to buy the whole album
B007KOYEOC|2.0|The story line is not strong enough. Sex sex sex sex sex sex sex sex sex sex sex sex sex

B008HT4FUW|4.0|This was a great buy.  I was disappointed that the &#34;Christmas Special&#34; (episode 9) was left off the collection but other than that is has been great!
B0086700CM|4.0|It's very addictive.  Running along pathways, jumping over obstacles and getting points.  All while being chased by demon monkey things.
B0071XO8RA|4.0|I enjoyed how the author developed the characters and how the story built as more and more habitats became evident.
B00APUYWYA|5.0|My teen daughters and I LOVED this! We watched it three times in a week. The dialogue is witty and memorable. The musical numbers are infectious.

B002ZG99A4|2.0|I've seen this at the movies and love it, thought I'd buy it on BluRay with Expendables 2.<br /><br />There starts the issues. DVD running fine, but the BluRay is region locked for some reason, the first time I've ever seen this. Of all my BluRay from Amazon only these two movies have a region lock.<br /><br />WARNING:<br /><br />So please confirm you have the correct player for the BluRay disc if you're not from USA. It appears only to be this series of movies from this manufactor.
B00377E5SG|5.0|An old classic remade with many fine actors.  I've seen this movie again and again.  With it's brilliant cinematography, tremendous cast, and fabulous story line, this is a must-see!

B0070Y46UY|3.0|I found the book to be a little bit slow at times, but the end made it a worthwhile read.
B000FCKC4C|5.0|Everything we need his hidden in the depths of our inner mansion...brilliantly written with such thirst for the offering each of us must give is our soul in this world but not of it for what other reason are we here but to fulfill our Personal Legend.
B00A9X9ORI|5.0|Great movie! Great strory! Fianlly something new with a story that was more important than special effects! Very satifying especially for Sci Fi.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|I loved it. As simple as that. This is my new favorite book. It's one of those stories that change you after you read it. I know this won't be the only time I will read this book. When I have a rainy day in my future I am gonna curl up on my couch and read this book again. And you should too.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Suspenseful and lots of unexpected turns. I loved it and now need to finish the trilogy .  I look forward to watching the movies too
B00A1EOBJQ|5.0|The songs are great and I love the show.  Chip Esten is one of my favorites.  I've watched him on Whose Line Is it Anyway.
B005PTYP70|5.0|I purchased this item as a Christmas gift for my Brother-in-law since he's a &#34;Mission Impossible&#34; fan.  He loved (loves) it!!!  Shipping was great!
B0053O89IS|5.0|I love this show because of the smart dialog and interesting subjects.  Much better than most junk on t.v. these days.
B006OAB3ME|4.0|I grew up in a rural area outside of NYC.  It was not unusual for the power to fail and for our large family to be left in darkness.  No problem!  Mom would light long-stemmed candles and place them atop the piano in their antique holders. Then she'd slide onto the piano bench, open the song book, and play music from the 40s. We'd sing these familiar songs--mostly Rodgers and Hart-- in our warbly children's voices.<br /><br />Paul McCartney's interpretation of songs my mother  played and we sang to is delightful. The lyrical music of the 1930s and 40s is packed with clever rhyme schemes and contagious music. For the most part, McCartney interprets this music well, although sometimes he strains to hit the note and he, like us children in the 1950s, warbles his way through the song.<br /><br />Of course one of my favorite songs on the CD is \\"I'm Gonna Sit Right down and Write Myself a Letter,\\" which includes the line from the CD's title:  \\"...a lot of kisses on the bottom...\\"  Fats Waller's lyrics make us giggle like children. All of the music sends me back in time.<br /><br />Interestingly, my favorite song is one of two of McCartney's originals on the CD. The title is \\"My Valentine,\\" (not \\"My Funny Valentine\\").<br /> This tear-jerker, although supposedly written for his new wife, Nancy, gives me the sense that Linda, his beloved wife who died of cancer, is a shadowy presence who flits and flutters around the edges of the music.<br /><br />I bought the CD for half a dozen other people because I loved it so.<br /><br />Nany Seligmann Schumann
0316228532|5.0|Bought this for my fiancé for Christmas, she was a huge Harry potter fan, so she couldn't wait for this book to come out! She recommends for all to read
B001IFZL50|5.0|This was a gift and he absolutely loved it.  He had been wanting to see this for quite some time.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|It was unbelievable sad it would have been terrible if  they didn't get back together then it would have Ben two sad and unbearable even if it is just a book
1580084621|5.0|Fantastic!!!! I'm from Spain and It arrived even earlier than scheduled and in perfect conditions. I will definetely buy more stuff.
B002MQYOFW|2.0|Personally I haven't been this let down since the grapes of wrath!! This book is just like every other new thing in this century. Sucks and hyped up by the mainstream, which is also why I don't vote. Book sux. Peace out.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Samurai sword, deranged cult leader, swat tactics, prison break, gladiators, and new heroes to name just a few of the scenes that make this season rock!
B007FEZQF8|5.0|I love this book<br />One of the best books I ever read<br />If you love horror you should read this
B00A757EFW|4.0|It was a good product, fun for the kids...worth it!  This is an item that is great for killing time!
B006Z9SP3E|5.0|Just brilliant<br />I didn't put  down the book for the whole day!<br />Like my English says a good book is . One which can hold you by the balls! And you can bet it did that!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Great book better then the movie I couldn't put it down till I finished reading it can't wait to finish the other ones
B009CPJHY4|4.0|Beautiful to watch, wonderful characters, deeper than expected<br />Somewhat (to say the least) unrealistic, but that did take away from the movie
B009KS4XRO|5.0|If you enjoy Bingo your sure to enjoy this one. Shows all the numbers called unlike some so if you happen to miss one you can always check the board,
B00A0SKFLG|2.0|This movie consists of a long series of shot-em-up scenes from start to finish. Pretty much the same bunch of good guys slugging it out with the same bad guys every scene. Not much of a plot. OK there is the mandatory pretty girl, not much else going on. The original was a clever movie for its time, and much better.<br /><br />Only reason to give it 2 stars is that the technical work on CGI was very good.
B0063GORYU|1.0|For some reason when playing this game it has a lot of hesitation,<br />I actually like Spider Solitaire just not on my Kindle Fire.
B004VMVTNU|5.0|Great alarm app, the red and blue theme favorite. Easy to use.  Highly useful.<br />Interesting alarm configuration for multiple a lama on different days.  Mostly set and forget.
B009B0L324|4.0|I always enjoy listening to AC/DC, but I would rate this live version, lower than the other live versions they have.  The songs sound \\"tired\\" and \\"slowing down\\", due to the aging of the band.  But the cd is worth listening to, compared to some other groups out there.
B007V65R54|4.0|&#34;I had a hard time putting this book down,&#34; is not the usual description for a book about probability. Nevertheless, I found it gripping even though I'm neither a sports, nor probability, fan. I've been searching for a way to talk about and think about especially contentious social issues, and this helps me tremendously. It's correctly, in my opinion, stresses the need we have to understand the world around us even though we never have complete picture of it. The world is complex and it's easy to get lost in all the detail. So, how does one find one's way to more correct, less wrong, grasp? By continually making predictions about the world and, then, fearlessly, refining our predictions in light of new information. An example from the book may help me explain. Assume you've just popped into being right before dawn and the sun comes up. &#34;Whoa!&#34; you say. &#34;That won't happen again!&#34; But then it does the next day, so you're little less certain it won't happen, until, eventually, you'll become confident the sun will, in fact, come up the next morning. It seems simple in this example, but it's a breathtaking idea when you apply it to every day questions such as &#34;how much will my house increase in value?&#34;
B006M595FI|5.0|Lots of great tunes on thie disk I have rateed at least half of this disks songs 4 stars or more. some weaker track yes, but over all pretty dang good!
B00APUYWYA|4.0|This movie plot could have been done more along the line of &#34;Drumline&#34; but a more gonzo approach was taken to developing the plot in Pitch-Perfect.  The music was fun and the singers talented.  The musical-movie a vehicle to present the music and the singers; it did not get enough mileage for my liking in Pitch-Perfect.
B001TK8TJO|4.0|Before my husband and I got married our pastor had us read through this book together.  It provided a lot of good discussion points and helped to ground us as we began our marriage.
B000UX6THK|5.0|This has been a fun purchase.  Friends and I have TP Marathons!  Watching for hours!  I missed some of the original series, so it's been fun to catch up.
B007IXWL2C|2.0|More isn't always better and the third book of the trilogy is just more of the same old thing; one graphic sex scene after another.  I get that it was a novelty in the first book, then the first book was such a great seller that a second book had to be written, then the second was a best seller so a THIRD had to be written...or did it?
B004F1F32A|1.0|I ordered the movie and there was an error that popped on the screen.  I never knew I had it.  When I saw this, I looked in my library and it wasn't there.  Never got the movie!
B000002AD0|5.0|Simply awesome....a band burning it up 8 months before they hit it big at Wstock...its pretty spectacular,epic.check out \\"Freeway\\".Perhaps one of the great live albums ever,which it is.
B005LAIHZY|4.0|Another great princess movie. This princess is very independent. Good movie for your girls and boys good moral lessons to be learner.
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|I read the reviews for this book and had my doubts. I branched out waiting for some of my normal authors to release book and I am not disappointed. I read this book in a day and I never wanted it to end. I just fell in love with these characters. The problems seemed real, the outbursts and tiffs Abby and Travis get in are things that I can see happening to college students. I liked this book so much I read it twice and I may read it one more time before archiving it.
B008Y1YK9Y|5.0|Thank-U 4 sendiong Me Men In Black 3 and I enjoy The Movie a great deal . Thank-U again .
B003P9VZ0W|5.0|My daughter loves this! It is worth every penny! It was a Christmas gift and I think I may purchase for other little girls her age! Shipping was fast and service great. Thank you again.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|me and my friends and family constantly fight to see who can get a better score! (currently trying to beat my cousin!) this game also never gets boring and I have been playing it since October! recommend it to kids adults the elderly, because it is a fun game!
B00877R85I|4.0|Having seen this book everywhere, and being dimly aware that they already made the movie (I generally don't watch movies), I guess I figured I better find out what the fuss was about.  I'm a little slow on the uptake of popular culture sometimes.<br /><br />What I found is that much of the praise is quite warranted.<br /><br />Some authors just know how to tell a story.  If I could make a recommendation, I would save this book until such a time as you need to effortlessly occupy several hours.  If you open it at bedtime you might end up reading until the wee hours.<br /><br />The criticism I have is that it doesn't seem like the magnitude of the moral or psychological horror of the games, or the Capitol, is ever expressed by the characters. Maybe that's what happens after several generations over which the hopeless cruelty of the games, and the incessant oppression and exploitation by the Capitol, just obliterates any sense of moral outrage.<br /><br />I kept expecting Katniss, or someone...anyone, to rage some.  I kept expecting a more thorough examination of the moral dilemma (kill an innocent or become a dead innocent).  The premise is absolutely brutal, and the real human response to such brutality remains unexplored.<br /><br />Another disappointment is that Katniss is the only character.  Everyone else is just a foil, mirror, or echoing surface off of which bounces.  Haymitch, for example, could be an excellent character.  There seems to be more to Cinna than meets the eye.  Maybe this is all being set up for the next books in the series, I don't know.<br /><br />Maybe one is asking for too much from a supposed young-adult novel.  In conclusion, we have an excellent piece of entertainment, which maybe could have been a moving piece of literature.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|All the books were good the trilogy I would finish one book and pick up the next one. Definite page turner just like the twilight series
B008CLI3TE|3.0|I bought this as a gift for my husband, who is a huge fan of the books. We've only watched the first episode from the series, which seems to have thrown much of the story detail aside in favor of packing as much T&A and doggie-style coupling into each scene as possible. I have no problem with soft porn, but I would like to know that's what I'm buying instead of assuming I'm buying a filmed version of what was a pretty great book series.
B005C0DHEY|5.0|Gas Land is imformative, unbiased, scientific. It shows how the essence of humanity is affected by greed, corruption, ignorance and defiance. It delves into the world of Fracking and heeds us a warning to the dangers of hazarduous process of extracting natural gas from the earth and how this can and will affect our air, land, sea, animals, plant life and even our own bodies. Anybody who thinks that shooting an excess of 500 different unregulated chemicals into the ground, and not have it contaminate the ground water, is crazy. It is criminal what these companies are getting away with and their misdeeds will affect us and future generations for hundreds of years to come. Watch this documentary, it is very good and may even shock you. I highly reccommend viewing this film, it may spark a call in you to rise to action and stop this injustice to the world called Fracking.
B007HACDLK|4.0|this was a decent book that was a good re-entry into the present timeline. the last two books by vince flynn were decent but the extreme measures/pursuit of honor plot was awesome. this one seems to begin a new launch point for mitch rapp.
B00ANT6OK8|3.0|The film was OK. A lot of time spent on the intelligence gathering in the years leading up to the mission, and the mission itself. What was strangely & very annoyingly glossed over was the planning, training  & intelligence gathering that occurred once the compound was identified. If the viewer only goes by the film, it is as if the mission just materialized out of thin air and that the 2 helos of Seals were the only forces involved in the mission.Therefore, the film is not an accurate, historical account of the story.
