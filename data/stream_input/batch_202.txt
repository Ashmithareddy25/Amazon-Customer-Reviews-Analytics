B00003CXAA|5.0|I have been a Godfather fan for years and have seen all three movies many times.  This collection is a must for the true fan.  Not only is the quality exceptional, the extras are excellent.  If you have seen the movies more than once, than you will love the feature which lets you hear the director's commentary while you watch.  It will give you insight into the casting, filming, script writing, etc that you won't get anywhere else.  It takes the movie to another level for the Godfather fanatic.  You will also enjoy the deleted scenes and many of the multiple added features on the fourth disc.  Worth the investment for a set of films that will live forever as true classics.
B000050XEI|4.0|This was the first enya cassette I brought. When I heard only time I knew I had to buy it, but I wanted to see if they were any other songs I liked from her previous albums and I was surprise that she did songs that I haven't heard in years, You know you might hear a song and you love it but you don't know who performed it.  So I bought every album except the Celts which I'm planning to buy soon. My favorite tracks on this album are lazy days because I can relate :-) A day without rain, Fallen Embers, Flora's Secret and Deora Ar Mo Chroi. I did think it was short but I liked it very much, something new. I would agree with some of the reviews it's relaxing something to listen to on a sunny or rainy day just lying on your bed watching time flow by.
B00001OH1S|5.0|I put off buying this CD due to a few reviewers' comments that the songs are too short and regretted it.  I didn't find the songs to be lacking.  If anything, our favorite, Sinnerman, was almost too long (over 10 minutes!)  My suggestion is if you loved the music in the movie, don't hesitate getting the soundtrack regardless of what others say.
B00005JKT8|3.0|We loved the movie, my husband and I, but were a little disappointed in Meg.  Hugh Jackman carried the movie great, he was charming, handsome and fit the part. But Meg Ryan is looking a bit worn for the part, perhaps due to her recent breakup, but her lips appeared swollen like she'd had some collegen that didn't take well, and her hair was awful.  Despite that, I plan on seeing it again and will certainly buy it when it comes out on DVD!
B000002AH9|5.0|In his new liner notes, arranger-conductor Ray Ellis writes that after listening to this album again, this time emotionally not musically, only did he realize how great it was.  Any Billie Holiday fan would heed Ellis' advice.  By doing so, one will get a true understanding of the final days of Billie Holiday and her lasting legacy to the world of jazz.<br />Billie's voice breaks and she is no longer in fine form.  But make no mistake, the soul is still there.  She never lost it.  In &quot;I'm A Fool To Want You,&quot; you feel as if you're the one she is pleading to in the line, &quot;Take me back, I love you.&quot;  I don't know of any other singer, save Tony Bennett, who can evoke such empathy from a listener as Billie does.  Listen to &quot;You've Changed&quot; and if you're not moved by her singing, you are artistically dead.<br />Track no. 15 (elapsed time at 07:49) captures Billie in a rare rehearsal out-take, singing &quot;The End of A Love Affair&quot; a cappella.  This is one of the best moments in the album.  Unfortunately, she didn't get to finish the song, but the rare moment is captured here for us to relish forever.<br />&quot;Lady in Satin&quot; is a perfect model for today's so-called pop &quot;divas&quot; (pooh!) who think that by screeching and screaming, they could draw emotion from a song.  Take a lesson from Billie Holiday, ladies.  Lady Day exuded class and sang with soul.  And she didn't have to pierce my ears with her voice.  On the contrary, it warms my heart each time I listen to her.  Show me a female singer today who can do that.

B00005RFAI|5.0|I hear so many people complain: \\"It's such a shame Pink doesn't do black music anymore.\\" Hello?! Rock IS black music. Rock, along with many other genres of popular music like rap, hip-hop, dance, and reggae are all branched out from R&B. And what's so cool about this is that all these elements can be found in Pink's new CD. Pink has great taste and knows how to broaden her ranges, and I'm down with that. I admire her. She without a doubt is an individual, and it's stated clearly in her lyrics that she has a lot of self-respect and does not want to be compared to all those pop moguls out there. I really like the songs. Each one has an awesome sound and message. I can really relate to songs like \\"Missundaztood\\", \\"RESPECT\\" and \\"18-Wheeler\\". I couldn't have said it better myself. \\"Numb\\" has a Nirvana/Green Day-like feel to it. \\"Lonely Girl\\" features a chorus sung by Linda Perry, who worked with Pink on this record. I think she is a musical genius to whip up instant-hit hooks, no filler from her. There is also another celebrity appearance from the outstanding Steven Tyler himself, you callaborated with Pink on \\"Misery\\". They sound amazing together, they both have raspy, blues-like vocals and can belt out such emotion. This album includes the smash hits \\"Get The Party Started\\", \\"Don't Let Me Get Me\\" and \\"Just Like A Pill\\". I really hope \\"18-Wheeler\\" is her next single, because that is definitally a hit.

The whole dialoge is too abrupt, the whole concept of the movie is very un-realistic, and of course based on a love story just to intice the younger generation of the audience.<br />poor movie script indeed<br />Sincerely<br />Alfredo Blume

0525946284|4.0|Jackdaws presents Ken Follett back in action and gives us a glimpse of the authors greatness that's been lacking for so long. I was a bit surprised when i finished this new novel from my former favorite author. I liked it very much! Thought that the man was a has-been after several not-so-good books in the 90s. But Jackdaws borders to classic Follett reminiscent of great books like Eye of the needle, Triangle, The Key to Rebecca, The Man from St Petersburg and Lie down with lions. It's suspense from page one and the whole set-up of the story reminded at least me of Eye of the needle, the battle between two strong individuals (in this case a young, beautiful british woman and a german nazi making a career) as a war is going on in the background. Two people that can change the outcome of the WW2 and the classic scenario of a spy behind enemy lines. Follett has always had strong women in his books and it's no different in Jackdaws. The suspense grows even bigger when the reader is rooting for Felicity, aka Flick, and her gang of women volunteers when they're dropped behind enemy lines in France to destroy a radio station belonging to the germans. <BR>Jackdaws also shows that Follett is at his best when he writes books with a historical backdropping or from one of the great wars, WW1 or WW2. Almost gave up on Follett after Code zero but now I'm looking forward to his next one!

B00005RFQ5|2.0|In the last decade, Prince has all but abandoned his darker, raunchier side.  Every other album he released in the 1980s was a verified classic, but in the last 10 years, his output is hit-and-mostly-miss.  &quot;The Rainbow Children&quot; is a tough album to sit through, and it will require patience from even the most rabid of Prince devotees.  Though the disc has some moments (nice artwork, too), it has two or three good songs buried underneath heaps of filler.
B00003CXTG|4.0|i thought the movie was well done, but i can see were people would be upset with the film.  they did make it into a romantic movie.  I like that type but if you don't them the film may not be for you.  what they did show of the war was excellent thought, it made you feel as if you were there experiencing it.
B00000DI06|5.0|There are two schools of requiems: those that try to scare the living into being good (including those by Mozart, Berlioz, Verdi, and Webber) and those that try to console the grieving (including those by Brahms, Faur&eacute;, and Durufl&eacute;).  Brahms has met his match in the Rutter Requiem!<br /><br />The Rutter Requiem is fairly short, clocking in at approximately 35 minutes, but it is exquisite.  I'd argue that every movement is perfectly composed.  This recording shifts the balance away from the orchestra and towards the choir, but that helps to enhance the listener's connection to the Latin and English texts.  Unfortunately, Caroline Ashton sounds tentative on the Pie Jesu, and she lacks the emotion and phrasing to pull off the movement.  Besides that, the artistry of the recording is virtually flawless.  Kudos to Donna Deam for a moving, pure, and clear solo in the final movement.<br /><br />Movement I:  Requiem aeternam / Kyrie.  After a mysterious introduction, Rutter introduces a divinely inspired melody that will melt the hardest of hearts.<br /><br />Movement II:  Out of the deep (Psalm 130).  A plaintive cello solo combines with the choir's plea for God to listen and show mercy.<br /><br />Movement III:  Pie Jesu.  An exquisitely simple request for Jesus to grant the dead everlasting rest.<br /><br />Movement IV:  Sanctus.  A joyous song of praise.  I can understand those who find this movement repetitive and with too much emphasis on high-register instruments and voices.<br /><br />Movement V:  Agnus Dei.  An incredible building up of a standard supplication, interspersed with excerpts from the Book of Common Prayer and flute solos that hearken back hundreds of years.<br /><br />Movement VI:  The Lord is my shepherd (Psalm 23).  The apex of the requiem, a statement of faith and confidence, with lush strings and a beautiful oboe solo.<br /><br />Movement VII:  Lux aeterna.  A reassuring conclusion, \\"Blessed are the dead who die in the Lord,\\" before a return to the melody of the first movement.<br /><br />The MAGNIFICAT has some truly wonderful moments of exuberant joy and quiet reverence in it, but it cannot compare emotionally with the REQUIEM.  (Personally, I don't especially care for the second movement.)  Patricia Forbes has one of the best voices I've ever heard, especially well suited for the calm, lyrical, confident parts of movements IV and VI.y wonderful moments of exuberant joy and quiet reverence in it, but it cannot compare emotionally with the REQUIEM.

B00005QZ7U|1.0|My husband and I got through the first 15 minutes of this movie and turned it off.  I cannot even describe why it is so bad. Lack of storyline, bad acting..to name a few.....Do not bother with this one!
B00003CXTG|5.0|Granted this movie does not cover Pearl Harbor like &quot;Tora, Tora, Tora.&quot;  It is Pearl Harbor from a different view.  The love triangle was good as two friends overcome the rivaliry for the same woman's affection to watch each others back in Japan.  FDR standing up after the attack could become memorable.  The movie also does a excellent job of protraying blacks.
B00004Z459|5.0|Being a 14 year out girl im not the expert on music, but this album is INSANE!  The way this amazing band combines the sounds of rock and rap make this album ... well ITS THE BEST!  Yeah many people compare the sounds of Likin Park to the sounds of Limp Bizkit but im tellin ya...  NEVER COMPARE THE TWO BANDS! EVER!  Listen to Limp Bizkits song Rollin and then listen to Linkin Parks song By Myself.  By listening to the two jams im sure you would understand what i mean.  Linkin Park seems to express their true feelings through their emotional lyrics and LB... say no more.  I don't even wan't to talk about them.  All in all LP is a totally an original band and no matter what music you listen to im sure you will absolutly love them!  I know I do and i just can't wait until their new album come out! AHH I LOVE THEM!

B00004T8RK|2.0|This CD should be enough to convince anyone that Kurt Cobain had the right idea.  Pearl Jam apparantly have decided to take the approach of &quot;better to fade away than burn out&quot; because the amount of energy in their CDs has been steadily declining their entire career.  Seriously, why do they even bother recording songs if they're going to be so lazy about it?  The songwriting on this CD is almost as good as any of their other stuff, but the songs were recorded in such a boring way that this CD'll just put you to sleep.  Plus the song Evacuation is absolutely horrible.  These songs are probably pretty great live, but Pearl Jam doesn't get that the point of recording a CD is to make something well-constructed and memorable, not just to have an electronic document of your songs.  I think part of the problem is that Pearl Jam has steadily become more and more of a democracy of guys who are too afraid to take control and so they've been kind of lacking in direction and afraid to take risks.  Quite annoying, because they have so much musical talent but have always been totally lacking in the motivation and vision that made bands like Nirvana and the Smashing Pumpkins shoot for the stars.
B000000H5K|5.0|I know...I already wrote a review...and I made the mistake of giving it only 4 stars...but it SURE deserves 5...The more I listen to this album, the more I love songs that I hadn't give enough attention to...Almost every song is good on it...<BR>Roots Bloody Roots is The classic, catchy, heavy, explosive, one of the songs that made me buy the album (along with Straighthate, Spit and Dictatorsh!t), songs to discover after a couple of listenings (Cut-throat, Lookaway, Breed Apart, the incredible Dusted and the amazing Born Stubborn), some tribal music that sure worth a fine listening (Itsari and especially Jasco) and a death metalish song, Dictatorsh!t.  In the end, it all results into a mad, never-before-seen raw power rendered by Max Cavalera's angry voice and the band's heavy and catchy music.  Sepultura has given us one of the most incredible records ever, they have the talent to give something heavy a catchy fierce and filthy aspect.  When I compare this to other Sepultura albums, it is different (the Sepultura with Derrick Green isn't the same thing at all, and albums that came before Roots don't always have the catchy aspect of Roots, except in some Chaos A.D.'s songs).  This was Sepultura's most ambitious project, and, damn, they didn't fail to give us something great!  I love this album, I rediscover every song on it each day.  This album is so great, every metal fan should own it. Really.
B00004SPYJ|4.0|Okay, this film was exceptionally good. I enjoyed watching it, I thought it was romantic and beautiful and yadda yadda yadda. I reccomend it to everybody. The reason I gave it four stars was because, well, lets put it this way--the acting is great, but after a while a lot of it was whiney, and the crying was a bit fake every once in a while...it started to get annoying. But thats my only complaint. I really thought it pretty good though.

0780619587|5.0|This is one of the most beautiful films I have ever seen. I bought this DVD as a gift, as I have seen this film five times already in three different languages.  I was astounded at how the film was at once simple yet moving and realistic withouyt resorting to any sappiness.  as someone who has struggled to become a good pianist (though hardly a virtuoso), I understood the emotion and desire that can overcome you as you decide to tackle a difficult piece.  Learning it is akin to a great triumph. I think the film is strongest during the sequence that depicts Helfgott's study at the Royal Conservatory as he learns the Rachmaninov concerto no. 3.  The shots of the hands climbing the keyboard, the emphasis on the choirds of the main cadenza and the obvious satisfaction shown by the actor were very moving.  I was on the edge of my seat.  I think, howver, the scene that truly shows what music can mean is one of the final ones as helfgott is jumping on a net listening to a headset playing a Vivaldi cantata.  He's completely lost in the music and an unbound happiness.  As I told the girl that accompanied me to my first viewing of the film, that's what music means to me.
B00005J73X|5.0|If you are a Bon Jovi fan or just someone looking for some good rockin'(feel good music), this is it. This CD has a great selection of Bon Jovi's hits and some surprises as well.  The live versions of It's My Life; Livin'On a Prayer; You Give Love a Bad Name &amp; Bad Medicine are terrific.  One Wild Night is not to be missed. This CD brings back a lot of great memories and I'm enjoying every minute of it. Keep it up Bon Jovi!!
B000002B35|5.0|Words cannot describe how perfect this album is. I thought The Delicate Sound of Thunder was good, but this totally blew it away. Only 2 things made it not perfect, the way they did Shine on you Crazy Diamond and Comfortably numb. I liked the Delicate Sound of Thunder version of Shine on better. And comfortaby numb really can't be done the way I like because they need a full orchestra to do it. Nevertheless, this is a must have for any PF fan.
B00005JKT8|4.0|The movie, Kate &amp; Leopold, could be considered a &quot;chick flick&quot;, but I went with my husband and he liked the movie too.  The main characters are:  Kate(Meg Ryan) and Leopold, Third Duke of Albany(Hugh Jackman) and funny secondary characters:  Stuart, Kate's ex-boyfriend(Liev Schreiber from the Scream movies), Kate's brother Charlie(Breckin Meyer from Inside Schwartz), and Kate's boss JJ(Bradley Whitford from West Wing).  Stuart is a inventor/science guy who finds a time portal to 1876 and travels there.  Leopold follows him back through the portal and that is when the fun begins.  Imagine trying to fit into a world 125 years in the future.  Kate enjoys the attention and care that Leopold gives her and he finds himself falling in love with her.  Reality sets in and Leopold does go back to 1876, but you have to see the movie to see the happy ending.  Meg Ryan is her usual sweet self, Liev Schrieber does a good job with his limited scenes, Breckin Meyer is so cute as the younger brother, but Hugh Jackman is the star.  His charming presence, soft spoken accent, humor, and grace make him the reason to see this movie again and again.  The only reason I did not give it 5 stars is that the movie ends way too quickly - I needed an short &quot;epilogue&quot; on what happens after the &quot;happily ever after&quot;.  I will definitely be buying this movie on DVD.
B00005QZ7U|5.0|The Moulin Rouge movie and DVD are works of art!  Even the box is very artistic.  I have not been a big fan of the movie musical, but this movie has risen to the top of my list.<br />After seeing the movie in the theater, I immediately wanted to see it again because there is so much to see in many scenes.  The songs blend so well with the story that you can tell what's happening in the movie when you hear the song.  The acting, singing, and choreography are breath-taking.<br />The DVD provides bonus features such as music videos, the HBO Making feature, and a Behind the Red Velvet Curtain version to learn about the history and technology.<br />Although it's a sad movie, it's invigorating to watch and provides an inspiring theme of truth, beauty, freedom, and most of all LOVE!
0694013889|1.0|We have several potty books for little girls, and &quot;Once Upon a Potty&quot; by far is not one that my daughter ever picks up to have me read to her. In fact, we've had this book for almost a year now and I think I've only read it to her twice. My daughter just pushes the book away when I pick it up for us to read. The illustrations are dark and not at all brightly colored or interesting. And like the other review listed here, my daughter calls the potty in this book a cup. I bought this book online, and only after reading xlnt reviews. If I had seen it at our local bookstore, I wouldn't have bought it.
B000002HIK|5.0|I've been listening to this album for four years, and it hasn't left heavy rotation since I went out and bought (yes, physically left the house and purchased, no downloading this gem!) the CD. From &quot;Acrid Avid Jamshred&quot; all the way to &quot;Next Heap With&quot;, this disc weaves up and down in 64-odd minutes of the most intelligent dance music. Favorite tracks include &quot;The Waxen Pith&quot;, &quot;Icct Hedral&quot;, &quot;Wet Tip Hen Ax&quot;, &quot;Mookid&quot;, &quot;Cow Cud Is A Twin&quot;, and one of my favorite tracks from any genre of music (eat your heart out Beethoven, Bach, Mingus) &quot;Alberto Balsam&quot;. That steel-drum sound -- don't even ask how he produces that -- the rhythms, and that haunting/enchanting melody have landed this track on mix-tapes for people who hate techno. I was nervous when I put it on a mix for my mom; it is now one of her favorite tracks! Okay, so if you are keeping track, I listed nearly every track as one of my favorites. This is that kind of album!
B00003CXAA|5.0|\\"The Godfather DVD Collection\\" gives the greatest movies of all time the special treatment they deserve. The Godfather Complete Epic combined the first two films into one movie, with the action taking place in chronological order.  In addition, some scenes that were originally edited out were put back in.  I much prefer \\"The Godfather\\" and \\"The Godfather Part II\\" in their original versions, which is the way they appear in this DVD collection.  Both movies won the Academy Award for best picture, which is an amazing achievement.  In addition, \\"The Godfather Part III\\" was nominated for best picture. A partial cast list includes some of the greatest actors of all time: Al Pacino, Marlon Brando, Robert DeNiro, Robert Duvall, Talia Shire and Diane Keaton.    What really sets the Godfather DVD Collection apart is the Bonus Materials disc. It includes a documentary on the making of the films, deleted scenes from all three movies, theatrical trailers and much more. I discovered a hidden bonus in a normally boring feature. In the section entitled \\"DVD Credits\\", I kept hitting next to fast forward past the extensive lists of names. After the last list, it takes you to a scene from the HBO series \\"The Sopranos.\\" They're trying to watch a bootleg copy of the Godfather DVD! That's an extra surprise in a disc already packed with features.
B00003CXTF|1.0|The romance is boring and predictable, Ben Affleck's lines are comparable to Fabio's in the &quot;It Must be Butter&quot; ads, and there is a paucity of authentic events.  I expected something far more absorbing, a kind of &quot;Saving Private Ryan&quot; meets &quot;Titanic.&quot;  Save your money, your time, and your mental acuity.  A thoroughly UNengaging flick.
B00005QZ7U|1.0|I skipped the theatrical release... the trailer is much more intense and enthralling, believe it or not, than the movie itself. The DVD product shows off very well the possibilities for additional content not available in the video format.<br />After watching all of the director's commentary and behind-the-scenes material, I am convinced that the best of the movie's story was removed prior to production. While the set and costume design are stunning and should garner several award nominations, the singing was quite weak, the acting pretty good given the poor script and choppy &quot;MTVish super quick cuts&quot; editing style. The editing probably had the most detrimental affect on the overall quality of the finished product. Make-up design was excellent, as well.<br />Speaking of &quot;product,&quot; I can't help but think that, in the end, that's all that mattered: creating a highly marketable product without full concentration on the storytelling, visual presentation / pacing, and character development. I didn't expect an &quot;Apocalypse Now&quot; level of darkness or character development, but &quot;Moulin Rouge&quot; was horribly weak, using the &quot;rough and wild&quot; bohemian atmosphere in Paris to serve as only the most superficial setup for the movie. There was no balance to the slick musical numbers and nice costuming... bad wasn't really bad, dark and murky wasn't, and there was no really compelling tension in the movie, nor any reason to view the characters as sympathetic, or not, but rather as two dimensional caricatures.<br />Great idea, poor execution... similar to Star Wars Episode 1, which got too caught up in the computer animation and special effects and didn't present a decent, compelling storyline and &quot;real&quot; characters. Perhaps, the best part of the story/dialog was to use song lyrics from (mostly) recognizable pop songs (or was this used just to attract the twenty/thirty-something demographics?).<br />Unless you're really curious about the &quot;extras&quot; in the DVD package, check out &quot;Moulin Rouge&quot; by John Huston. For better stories/dancing/singing with a similar theme, start with Shirley MacLaine (a real &quot;triple threat&quot;) in &quot;Sweet Charity,&quot; &quot;Can-Can&quot;, or &quot;Irma la Douce.&quot;<br />Almost all fluff and no bite, especially when compared to previous versions of &quot;Moulin Rouge,&quot; or similarly themed movies.

B00005NP04|5.0|Martina's greatest hit's album is wonderful. Track after track of beautiful,emotional and simply fun songs. I can't help singing along to &quot;I Love You&quot;, and can't help admiring Martina's rich and deep performance on &quot;Valentine.&quot; What's really amazing here is that even the new songs on the CD are good. &quot;When God- Fearin' Women Get the Blues&quot; is infectious and funny and her strong voice shines through on &quot;Blessed&quot;. This greatest hits volume really delievers by showcasing what a versatile performer Martina McBride is. Worth every penny!
B00005QFF1|4.0|This movie was very heart-felt &amp; I couldn't help but using up all the tissues available to me.  Lovers would probably emphatise with the main characters when they first fall in love, when they were head over heels over somebody &amp; would do foolish things without knowing exactly why.  Unlike Western movies, due to Eastern culture (probably of the past anyhow), the expression of love was subtle but obvious just the same.  The story slowly unfolded &amp; only till the end, we started to realise the reasons why &quot;the road home&quot; was so important to Zhang ZiYi's character when she was an old lady.  Anyhow, the film was simply but beautifully made with perfect setting, giving us glimpses of trades that were dying or extinct such as porcelain repairer, believable cast.  Zhang ZiYi was such a revelation in the movie.  It's not her script that made her stood out but her body language of an 18 years old that defied the local tradition of match-making but followed her heart to be with someone she truly loved.  For a change, this movie didn't explore or criticise political beliefs in China then but concentrated wholly in the pursuance of the ideal of love.  Highly recommended

B00005JKES|1.0|I am a diehard Peak Freak, and have seen the entire series many times. The episodes that ARE contained in the collection are not at issue, nor is the quality of the DVD, nor the bonus material. I can not get a high-quality (DVD) version of the pilot anywhere, and it is the most important part of the first season. To omit it from the collection is heinous. Why call the collection &quot;The First Season&quot; if you're going to omit the most essential episode! I feel very angry about how this collection was released. If the pilot were available elsewhere in DVD format, I'd feel less cheated.
B00003CXZ1|1.0|I think that this movie won the number one for stupidity all year. I actually fell asleep. Don't waste time or money pass this by.
B00005N83M|4.0|Jennifer Lopez is cool, but she's not my favourite singer. I wish she'd knock off the Spanish songs. Nobody knows what you're saying Jennifer! I never thought she was a good actress, but I think she's an awesome singer!<BR>My favourite tracks are &quot;Love Don't Cost A Thing&quot; &quot;I'm Real&quot; (Orginial version) &quot;Play&quot; &quot;Ain't It Funny&quot; &quot;Come Over&quot; &quot;We Gotta Talk&quot; and &quot;I'm Real&quot; (Murder remix). The other tracks are ok, but some of are filler material.<BR>My absolute favourite song is &quot;Come Over&quot;. It's a very rude song, but I love the music, it's very haunting. I also love the murder remix of &quot;I'm Real&quot;, very cool. <BR>J.Lo impressed me with this CD, but I don't think she's as good as Britney and Jessica, who are both VERY talented singers. <BR>If you like J.Lo check out:<BR>Britney Spears &quot;Britney&quot;<BR>Jessica Simpson &quot;Irresistible&quot;<BR>Mandy Moore &quot;Mandy&quot;<BR>Blue &quot;All Rise&quot; (Ok, they're not a female singer, but they ROCK!)<BR>S Club 7 &quot;Sunshine&quot;<BR>I'd buy this album for the singles, but the majority of the songs are in Spanish or are very boring. Good try J.Lo.
B00003CXE7|5.0|This movie has everything that there should be in an action movie, great job Russel and Ridley. Ohh yeah great special features.
B000002NHN|5.0|How does one begin to talk about this music?  After listening to this album, I feel that all my other CDs are pale, rough, and uncouth compared to what I hear in The Book of Secrets.  Loreena McKennitt trancends the limits we have placed upon ourselves in the past, and uplifts music to a new level, her level.  One of the huge reasons, I suppose, is because Ms. McKennitt writes for her own sake and no one else's, so in a sense we understand how she views the world.  However, if that is true, I am at a loss to explain how what she sees, feels, and understands connects with her listeners so deeply.  Her songs bring pleasure, joy, and sadness that lives, not in your head, but in your heart.  From the first time her music was played, it took root and grew in me, and changed me.  One does not see the world the same after hearing this.<br />In most reviews I talk about the music, but I am not sure how to describe it, for it is different for each listener.  I will do my best.<br />Most artists have a particular strength, be it singing, instrumentation, or songwriting.  Loreena McKennitt is the first muscian I have heard who can do all three brilliantly.  None of the above strengths overshadows the other; they flow together equally.  <br />The most noticable quality is her voice.  It is not your average screaming diva voice.  It is quite unique.  It can be clear with joy, thick with sadness, whispery with wonder, or strong with longing.  She is also the first artist I have heard who has used his/her voice as a perfect instrument, like in the Prologue or Marco Polo.  Instead of being the focus of her music, it is simply part of it.<br />Instrumentation is another key.  In this CD Loreena McKennitt mostly plays harp, accordian, piano, or keyboards, though she also plays something called a &quot;ranoun.&quot;  (?)  In addition to these instruments, we get tons of others, half of which I could not identify by the name.  She collects them from all over the world, and blends themtogether to create ancient melodies.  (Did anyone notice the name of the violin player in &quot;Marco Polo?  He was called simply, &quot;Osama.&quot;  I am not suggesting that he is the illustrious terrorist; I simply found it humerous.)<br />Then there is composition.  What can I say?  The melodies combine themselves with the lyrics in such a way that I cannot separate the two.  They each express what is needed:  melody the more gut-sense, while lyrics the conscious recognition.  Without either, the music would lack the rich, spiritual meaning and become hollow.  Simplicity is added where it is needed, like in &quot;Dante's Prayer.&quot;  &quot;The Highwayman&quot; is more complex, though subtly so.  &quot;Skellig&quot; will break your heart.  The flute...wow.<br />A few miscellanious observations here.  &quot;The Mummer's Dance&quot; is the song that made her famous.  I see why.  It has a chorus that sticks in your brain.  &quot;La Serenissima&quot; is almost renniassance-sounding; it is a string-only orchestral piece.  I think she has 6 different instruments in it, but they all wrap around eachother in layers so that no instrument takes the lead.  Whenever you think you have this rather simple melody pinned down, everything slips around and changes places.  &quot;The Highwayman&quot; is ambitious, if any one word can describe it.  All 10 minute songs are.  At first, it seems monotonous, and yet, when listened to closely, one can detect the very subtle instrument and tempo changes that make the tension build, until we get to the very last stanza.  It still gives me goosebumps, and I have been listening to it for more than a year.  &quot;Night Ride Across the Causcus&quot; is just what it implies, a night ride.  Instead of listening about it, the lyrics and emotion bring you into it, weaving a web around you until you swear you're on a horse riding with faceless companions over a desert, under the stars.  &quot;Dante's Prayer&quot; is the most awesome piece, for Loreena McKennitt has accomplished something that few Christian singers have managed:  she expresses and personifies the soul's longing for God.  <br />I have only one request left to make Ms. McKennitt.  Please don't leave us!  For all of you who don't know, her fiance died in a boating accident a few years ago, and since then Loreena McKennitt has been on an indefinate haitus, possibly never to return.  On the brighter side, I read in an article she was &quot;contemplating returning to the stage.&quot;  Let us hope that she will stick in the business a little while longer, for the world needs more people who can make music like that.
B00005QIPH|5.0|As an avid follower of the NYC punk scene of the 1970s, I was absolutely thrilled to find The Strokes. I saw through the hype of the Britsh press, and found a band akin to the Velvets and The Stooges in both looks and style. It is like the last 25 years didn't happen. The songs have a rough feel to them, as if they are demos, but are none the worse for that. The production style enhances the record's nostalgic feel. I have the pre September 11 (UK copy,with different sleeve) copy, with 'New York City Cops'. This has to be the best album track, but sadly most of you will not get to hear it. Any song with feedback at the beginning is a hit with me! Is This It is the finest album of this year. Buy It!
6300218031|4.0|This film is ahead of its time if you consider when it was created. You have skinheads, celtic music (at the end credits) and tomboy (or if you prefer butch) chick long before these things made it out into the mainstream. Remember that this film was released in 1987!<br />The film owes a lot to its screenplay that must have been written by someone who knew exactly what was going on, to a point where the screenplay is lost on casting director. Thus, for instance, the characters live in the area of Southern California near the Mexican border and they even speak of living in &quot;sectors&quot; which is border patrol lingo for different areas. The characters' backgrounds are very believable with a neglected tomboy of a drummer that is punked out and the solid working class hero Keith with artistic talents, one can not help but wonder if Keith was meant to be a Chicano artist from a solid Mexican American family working in a garage and spraypainting murals as his genuine artistic activity. The opening shot of the film points in that direction because it shows Keith crossing over some heavy duty railroad tracks and that has a double significance, first as the right vs wrong side of the &quot;tracks&quot; in a small town, but also signifying the border region between the US and Mexico.<br />The film suffers from casting adults as teenagers, and still more is lost when the casting directr misses out on the cultural idiom. Skinheads are barely recognizable and none of them wear suspenders. The drummer girl, who is apparently  a punk rocker, if you look at the walls in her room, has no tattoos or real piercings, and does not look punk. Also, it is a bit odd to hear relatively flat chested Mary Stuard Masterson worrying about sagging breasts, which sounds like a heavy set person's affliction and which would really not be out of character when you consider her pigging out on takeout food and hanging out at Keith's garage because she has no place to go and no family to eat dinner with.<br /><br />Unfortunately none of this screenplay realism made it into the film since it was cast with mainstream actors who only interpreted acting a punk, skinhead or a working class hero, but did not look the part. The film is a great romantic comedy with an dynamite opening sequence (Too bad THAT music did not make it onto the soundtrack!), but then its starts straining the bounds of believability with its fairy tale like qualities, which fail as a source of satire. The perfect date takes a good piece of the film is almost unbearable to watch. Putting the girl waiting in the wings as a chauffeur on a date is a great pun, but it's so corny, that it's painful to see.<br />The actors do a tremedous job, Eric Stoltz giving credence to romantic obssession, something that only Eric Stoltz had been able to do with grace. Mary Stuart Masterson is great as the social outcast with a heart of gold, interaction between them being the best part of the film. The films dialogue is excellent, even in comparison with serious acting films beyond existential dramas with high school as the arena and everyone being a teenager. It loses a star for a few glitches, but it's the best film of its type to come out of the eighties.ner with.<BR>     <BR>Unfortunately none of this screenplay realism made it into the film since it was cast with mainstream actors who only interpreted acting a punk, skinhead or a working class hero, but did not look the part.

B00005JKES|5.0|I had to give it five stars, because, well, it's &quot;Twin Peaks!&quot; I remember being 14-yrs-old watching it with my Mom every Tuesday night!! Brilliant in acting, concept and design. There have been many who complained that the original 2-hour pilot episode was not included in this set. It's because it's produced by another production company. David Lynch is still fighting for the rights to &quot;Eraserhead,&quot; because it was done as a school project and the school still retains the rights to the movie despite his best efforts to buy it from them. I just bought the two-hour pilot from a supplier in Seattle no problem, copies do exist, there's just not very many of them. Do a thorough search on the net and you'll be able to track down a copy. In the meantime, I highly recommend this set. Whether you've watched it countless times or are thinking about checking out what all the commotion is about, it's a valuable asset to any DVD collection. It's the epitome of the twisted, bizarre journey that only David Lynch could create!!!
B00005R87Q|5.0|A dream come true for car freaks like me. <BR>Excellent special effects and cool cars make this a must see!<BR>Can't wait for part 2!
B000059HAI|5.0|This film is a superb telling of the events leading up to the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor. This film stays true to form and doesn't drift into fanciful stories related non-existant characters. This film was a collaboration between American and Japanese film-makers and the result is great success. The climax of the scene is the actual attack. Having been born in the years since this film was made I wasn't expecting the special effects to turn any heads, but I must say that the film is far better than the recent &quot;Pearl Harbor&quot; with its computer generated aircraft and warships. Tora... by contrast looks real not like a cartoon or some unrealistic farce. Judge for yourself experience true film-making at its best.
B000008JUM|2.0|I wanted so much to enjoy this, but was VERY disappointed in almost ALL of the arrangements, I should have heeded some of the reviews I read here that came into my mind as I frantically changed tracks to find something that I liked. Buy it used.
B00003CXTG|5.0|I really enjoy this movie. I was stunned by the special effects when those Japaneses bombed those ships. Really shows how terrible the day of December 7, 1941 was. And the plot was great too. Everyone did a great job to make this movie amazing. I recommend to buy the DVD, not only able to select your favourite scenes but also able to find out how those special effects were made.
0805066691|5.0|Since its publication in 1970, Dee Brown's well-documented history of American Indians from 1860 to 1990 has sold more than 5 million copies. Mr. Brown quotes from original documents, including translations of the actual words of the Indians as they made their eloquent pleas for justice in the many councils they attended and where they were deceived again and again by white men who robbed them of their land. Even though there's a certain sameness to the outcomes, each tribe had a different experience. The Indians didn't have a concept of ownership of land. To them, it belonged to everybody. As they couldn't read, they didn't know what they were signing, but even when they did understand, it was just a matter of time until new laws took even more land away. And then there were the massacres. I had tears in my eyes while reading about them, especially in the descriptions of the cruelty to women and children. The Indians fought as best as they could, but they were no match for big guns and well-equipped armies. It was an awful time in our history, one of shame for Americans.<br />Throughout the book I couldn't help thinking about the real stories it contained that would make great movies. There's the story of the Seneca Indian who took the name Ely Parker and studied to be a lawyer. Because he was an Indian, he was not allowed to practice and so he became an engineer. During the Civil war he was Military Secretary to U.S. Grant. Later, he was appointed Commissioner of Indian Affairs. How that all played out is a fascinating story. And then there is the story of the Ponca Indian, Standing Bear, who left the reservation in the late 1870s with a small band of people. Because of some helpful white men, his case was argued in the courts. The issue was whether or not an Indian could be considered a &quot;person&quot; and thus be able to live where he chooses. He won his case. But, alas, the outcome was ruled to just apply to his band and not to all Indians. There was often dissention within the tribes themselves. And deception and intrigue. In one case, a chief was bullied by his people into murdering a white man. Later, the very people who had forced him to do this turned him in to be hanged. And then there is the story of the white man married to an Indian and their half-breed children. The children all were able to read and write and there is a lot of documentation about what happened to all of them.<br />I just wish that somebody would write these screenplays. Surely they would be better than some of the make-believe hogwash about Indians that we've all seen. It seems they're either depicted as savage villains or subjected to too much political correctness. And talking about political correctness, I'm not sure about whether the term &quot;Native American&quot; is appropriate. As Mr. Brown's book was written in 1970, he referred to them as &quot;Indians&quot;. Bury My Heart at Wounded Knee&quot; is a well written and worthwhile book. It's upsetting of course, but I am glad for the perspective it gave me. I think it should be required reading in American History classes in high school.

B00005NWRS|5.0|This guy is just amazing.  He has way too much talent packed into that small frame.  My only comment to Ryan, personally, is please quit smoking.  Your voice is amazing right now when you're 26 or 27 but in ten years, you're going to sound horrible.  You are truly one of the most amazing performers of our time, and we don't want to see you victimized by the damages of cigarettes.

B00005RFAI|5.0|Gotta say off the bat-- I'd never listened to Pink before hearing that Linda Perry had produced her album.  I'm a HUGE Linda Perry fan, but not at ALL a 4-NonBlondes fan.  Linda's solo stuff (In Flight especially) is just amazing.<br />When I found out Linda had produced and co-wrote some of the songs, I had to have the album, and I was duly impressed.  This is still, obviously, very much a 'Pink' album, but there are some wonderful Perry influences in there.  Pink has a great sense of self, and a great sense of humor, and the album travels beyond what you'd expect from someone with pink hair.  It rocks, it's got a beat, it's got soul, but most of all, it has passion.  You can tell Pink is passionate about her craft.
B00005QG9J|5.0|If you are looking for something that fills a void in your musical soul, this is it.  Some have felt it departs too much from previous efforts, but I prefer to call it positive growth.  After all, things that don't grow stagnate.  <BR>The word choices in the lyrics are amazing and the overall playing on the album is in a class rarely matched in the music world today.  I swear that I have listened to it repeatedly since it came out and I still hear something new musically or lyrically every time.   (Plus, the CD itself  has a great picture on it!)  Buy it, it rocks!
6305827079|5.0|This video was fantastic. It is for us oldies that loved him from the start but also for the next generation that is coming up....THis shows the vital part of him that lived in these songs he sang. I know to every woman there is a Elvis that is hers, that sings to her, only her, he made us feel that way. It showed a time in his life, when he was in the best physical form, even tho all this performing would take it toil on him in a few short years, in this he was the best, it showed how he new music and did things to songs his way, and made them so much better. This was great, and that is all I know to say except it was AWESOME!! it is truly a video that if you do not own, so you can watch it over, and show it to our children and grandkids, to show where it all started, and the man they always heard about, Elvis Presley.
0385505833|4.0|I think a book is well written when it accomplishes its goals. This book was obviously intended as a nice, light Christmas read. It achieves this goal admirably. Although many people may be looking for an indictment of the commercialization of Christmas, Grisham's work still finds that under all the money changing, there still is a feeling of community and family and friendship. The book was a very good portrait of upper middle class life in America. If you are thinking of buying the book, the book seems pricey for the amount of content, but, especially at Christmas time, it is nice to have an extremely easy book that you can read in a few short hours.
6305827079|5.0|This video was fantastic. It is for us oldies that loved him from the start but also for the next generation that is coming up. Most of his work, movies, he wasn't proud of, but this is one that he can be very happy about.

B00000J8EK|5.0|I havent written a review for Amazon before but this album deserves a recommendation. This is definitely one of my favorite electronic albums and I wanted to give it 4.5 stars. There are very few throw-away tracks and the good ones are REALLY good. The lyrics may be mediocre (&quot;hey boy, hey girl&quot;) but just listen to the sounds. The bass drop on &quot;Under the influence&quot;, the rhythm and energy of &quot;Out of Control.&quot; The Chemical Brothers succeed where other electronic artists fail, in turning trippy sounds into melodies that work as songs. Highly recommended.
0380002930|5.0|I would describe this book as sweet, but yet full of suspense. One of the best novels of all times!
0553260111|5.0|I read Robert Ludlum's book, The Bourne Identity, and lost a lot of sleep over late night read-a-thon's.  I can't believe how RL grabs the reader from the first page and has the reader hanging on by their fingernails at the end of every chapter.  I was so impressed by this book, when I discovered there were two sequels to the Bourne Identity, I immediately purchased them.  They were not dissapointing either--two more weeks of sleepless nights trying to reach the thrilling climax at the end of each book!  If you love high speed espionage with chases, the beautiful female love interest, and the antagonist disquised as an evil devil that 'good' has to overcome, then I highly encourage you to run to the closest bookstore or library and get your own copy!
B000002UDB|4.0|I've been a huge Beatles fan since 3rd grade and I would say that \\"I Am The Walrus\\" and \\"Strawberry Fields Forever\\" are in competition with \\"A Day In The Life\\" for the best Beatles song ever.  And Magical Mystery Tour has other gems too.  It's solid.  You can play it the whole way through.  But it just doesn't play like an album, instead it feels like a best of compilation.  That might not bug you.  It bugs me.<br />P.S. Abbey Road is the best.
0064407667|5.0|A Bad Beginning, and all the books in the series, are wonderful. The mix of the grim and ridiculous make for some of the funniest books we've read in a long time. My daughter (aged 9) loves to tell her friends--and strangers-- all about the books, and has been responsible for at least 8 Lemony Snicket converts. My only complaint is that I have to wait for her to finish a book before I get to read it. She reads them on her own time as treat to herself (as opposed to a school assignment or the result of parental nagging) and can often be heard laughting outloud.
B00003CXXI|5.0|This is a great joy. Being a New York Jet fan this movie had double meaning as we adopted Shrek as our mascot.  The movie is creative, fun and keeps your interest.  This is one of the top 3 videos I bought on this site with #2 being &quot;Meet The Parents&quot;, a laugh riot and #3 being &quot;BACKYARD BASEBALL DRILLS&quot;, a must for Little League parents &amp; coaches.  Go Shrek!  This is pure entertainment.
B00005U122|5.0|Reg (or is it Rog?) did an INCREDIBLE job on this DVD. <BR>The extras (preparing-the-tour documentary, etc.) are great, and enjoying. It is hard to believe many people think of Roger as dour when they see how easily and often he laughs in the documentary. Would have been cool to have an interview with Roger, but so be it. <BR>I was a little disapointed to find that there was no booklet with the DVD, but knowing Roger, it probably would have taken another 2-4 years. <BR>It does come with both audio and video settings refernece (pink noise and a Dolby 5.1 system diagram for audio, and color bars for video). But does anyone besides a few know WHAT to do with color bars?<BR>Roger never looked happier than during Perfect Sense pt.2. He has spoken before in interviews about how much he loves it when the audience sings along with Nobody Home (NOT on this DVD). Well, the audience sang along with PS p.2, and Roger just walked up and down the stage with a huge smile, cheering the audience on. <BR>I attended the last show on the tour in Providence (the DVD is from Portland, Oregon), and this is a great tribute to that tour. <BR>All in all, slightly spartan, but another first class release from Roger Waters.
B000002V07|5.0|This is one of my favorite C.D.s of all time.  It's very mellow and easy to listen to anytime.  Hope's eccentric voice blends perfectly with the rest of the music.<BR>I would definately recomend it!
B00005QZ7U|5.0|This is simply the most stunning movie of the year.  Everything from the acting, cinematography, set design, and musical score culminates in an astonishing visual feast never seen before in American cinema.  The behind the scenes documentaries, picture galleries, interviews and cut scenes are a must for any fan.  Luhrmann is phenomenal and his movie is a masterpiece; Baz rises above Spielberg with this film.  If you buy one DVD this year, make it Moulin Rouge.
B00005JKES|5.0|First of all, to resolve some of the confusion over the absence of the pilot from this box set, this is not the fault of Artisan and Republic Pictures.  I am sure they would have gladly included the pilot, IF only they owned the rights to it.  Unfortunately, whoever does own the rights to the pilot has no plans to release it on DVD.  Warner released the pilot on video (you should be able to find this at your rental store); however, be forewarned that it is the expanded feature-length version produced for distribution in Europe, so do not watch the last fifteen or so minutes.  It attempts to resolve in that short time what Lynch could not do in 29+ episodes.  Moreover, it will spoil for you Cooper's dream with the dancing man, which is among the most memorable moments from the first season.  As one reviewer has already pointed out, the pilot was released in Asia on a region-free DVD, which is abailable on the net. Personally, as a dedicated follower of the television series, I am not too distraught over the absense of the pilot from this series.  Granted, if you have never seen the series, you should view the pilot prior to episode 1.  Nonetheless, while the pilot is well-written and directed, it far outstripped in quality by episodes 1-7.  <br />It is also amazing that, in lamenting the absense of the pilot from this set, some people have altogether ignored in their reviews the overall excellence of this box set.  This is without a doubt one of the most outstanding DVD issues I have seen.  With a newly-remastered digital transfer, which far surpasses the high quality of even the laserdisc transfer, Twin Peaks has never looked better.  Moreover, with DTS digital surround sound, the series has never sounded better.  The whole first season could have easily fit on 2 discs; however, Lynch has rewarded the loyal followers of this series with a 4 disc set, which makes possible the DTS sound and the numerous extras, which even includes the Log Lady introductions produced for Bravo.  This box set will be a benchmark with which to compare future DVD releases.  Now, hopefully Artisan will release the remaining episodes with a similar committment to quality.
B00005QG9J|5.0|i love Morning View....we'll just start off with that. I think Incubus is great and they have really mellowed out they're sound alot. This cd kind of has a mix of really mellow songs and others that get you hyped up so its good for all occassions...and what else can i say...Brandon Boyd to go along with his amazing looks also has an incredible voice.
B00005QB9A|5.0|A wonderful blend of music and romance.  This film is sure to win your stamp of approval.  A must see!
B00005Q45W|5.0|My absolute favorite track on this album is &quot;Alexandra Leaving&quot; based on the poem &quot;The gods Abandon Antony&quot; by  C.P. Cavafy.  Cavafy was always my secret, cherished poet that I held close for emergencies.  And when I heard the song and recognized the allusion, I nearly wept with joy.  Cohen has taken this poem and done a lovely thing to it.<br />And the rest of the album is his usual excellent work.  &quot;My secret life,&quot; is another superb track.
B00005QIPH|5.0|I don't care about the hype, I don't care if they are rich kids, I don't care much about originality either. I think some people are so arrogant that just because that the Strokes are hyped(which I agree to a certain degree), they just diss them by giving one star review.<br />As for me, I just have to acknowledge that Is This It is one of the best album in 2001. And I believe this is one of the strongest debut album in many years. I think they have the talent to create good albums in the future, and I can't say that to many other bands (especially from US, as I tend to like british pop and rock bands more).  Just name any other band that can write more infectious songs like Hard to Explain, Barely Legal, Someday, and you will appreciate what they have create in this album<BR>&lt;for those stingy and bitter one star reviewer especially, can you name your band?&gt;
B00005JKMO|4.0|Let me make a suggestion to people who are about to go see Ali.  When you come out of the theater ask yourself one question:  Did you get the message?  Because you might be asking yourself one of any number of questions about what you just saw.  You might not be sure it was any good. Is this movie disjointed, sort of, is it hard to follow, in some places, does it skip around, absolutely.  The reason you have to ask yourself if you got the message is because if you did then you probably thought it was a good film.  <br />The film basically covers the years between when Ali, then know as Cassus Clay, won the heavyweight title from Sonny Liston to when he won it again from George Foreman, about a ten year span.  And this span is when Ali was at the height of his fame.  The details are not as important as how they are presented in this film.  Since it is a docudrama everyone already knows what happened, but seen from the perspective of Ali, some of his choices seem to have been made for different reasons then were originally perceived.  Again there is no reason to go into them, but it makes this film much more interesting then if they had played it safe.  The movie is engaging from start to finish.<br />The best part about this movie is (to my surprise) Will Smith.  He did it.  I was totally cinvinced from the first scene in this film, he is Ali.  The swagger, the jive, the sincerity, he even looked like a prize fighter, he did it all.  The supporting players in this film, with a big high five to Jon Voight, are quite exceptional, despite slipping into the backround at many points in the film.  The look of the film was fantastic, and the boxing scenes were extremely well done.<br />Taking on a docudrama on a figure like Ali is one of the most difficult tasks a filmmaker can tackle.  This is because Ali is a living legend, and one of the most prominent sports figures in the twentith century.  His story is way too large for a movie so Michael Mann had an important issue confronting him.  What should this film be about?  His answer is not what the average person, and certainly not the average filmmaker might think.  He decided it should not be about anything, but capturing the essence of this almost mythical figure.  Did he do it?  I think so. Because I think I got the message.  Ali was a man heavily pushed and pulled out during a time of great turmoil in this country, but through it all he never compromised himself or his beliefs no matter what the consiquence.  I got that and that made this movie worth seeing to me.
0385505833|3.0|Tax accountant, Luther Krank, is skipping Christmas.  His only child, Blair, joined the Peace Corps, left right after Thanksgiving for the jungles of Peru, and won't be around to celebrate the holidays for the first time in her twenty-three years.  Luther just spent the evening going over his meticulous records and receipts, and found that the Krank family spent $6,100 on the holiday last year.  Outrageous!  Well not this year.  No gifts, no tree, no decorations, lights, or Frosty the Snowman on the roof, no matter how tough and persistant the neighborhood pressure.  No cards or invitations, he's cancelling their annual Christmas eve party, and saying no to the office black tie dinner, parties, fruit cakes, calendars...the list just goes on and on.  This year, he's convinced his wife to put all that money to much better use.  They're going to skip Christmas and go on a first class, ten day cruise.....  Take It's A Wonderful Life, minus the joy and magic, and combine it with an uninspired version of Dicken's, A Christmas Carol, and you'll end up with John Grisham's, Skipping Christmas.  This is a short, and readable little tale, with a few good laughs thrown in, that pokes fun at all the commercialism and silliness of the season.  With a trite and predictable plot, full of one dimensional cartoon characters, this is definitely not a story that stands the test of time, to be pulled out and read, year after year, as part of the holiday tradition.  For Grisham fans expecting legal action, drama, twists and turns, you'll be sorely disappointed.  For those of you looking for a fast, light, and distracting couple of hours, Skipping Christmas works just fine.
B00005AXEL|5.0|This is very good. Stevie proves over and over again that she moves with the times. This album can appeal to almost anyone, teens and adults alike. It's got the hard rock sound, a tiniest bit of country (but not a lot), and light melodic pop. It is very diverse. All of Stevies albums are great, and that includes this one! there is one two words to describe this album: \\"Diverse\\" and \\"WOW!\\"
0871137380|5.0|I read this book after hearing about the upcoming movie. All reviews I've seen have uniformly raved about this review and I will too. The book is a minute by minute account of raid into inner city Mogadishu, Somalia in 1993. Media reports at the time of the events in the book had left me with the impression that this episode was a disgraceful failure, what with American soldiers being dragged dead though the streets. I had at first been uninterested in this topic because of the aura of failure around the Somalia debacle. This book proves that that was not true. The men involved behaved heroically under unbelievably harrowing circumstances. The author highlights dozens of individual acts of heroism that in total make me admire and respect the men that fought and died there that day. The motives of the officers and politicians who ordered the raid at the Mogadishu apartment building are much more suspect. While Bowden's sympathies are completely with the men on the ground, he has at best neutral opinions of their leaders. Bowden even condones the shooting of hostile women and children as necessary and writes his account of these acts in such a way that the reader agrees. I read this book straight through over two days and a sleepless night; it was that good.
6305603847|5.0|I haven't even touched on the special features on the DVD yet, but the movie itself is incredible.  The imagery (both animated and live action) in synchronization with the music of Pink Floyd is abslutely stunning.  The movie begins with Pink's memories of losing his father during WWII, then goes on the describe his loneliness, his humiliation at school (The lyrics of Money used for both humor and to show the cruel action of the teacher), his loss of his wife (not death, she left him for another man), and the slow decay of his sanity.  The animated scenes include a very vivid portrait of war (bombings symbolized quite astonishingly by an enormous bird of prey clawing up chunks of the english countryside), the building of the wall (this is just an awesome scene all together), and the trial (complete with a stunning array of characters symbolizing a prosecutor, a judge, his school teacher, his wife, and his mother).  The film is one of the most visually arresting ever made, and it uses only the lyrics and music of Pink Floyd to advance what little true plot it has.  But it wouldn't particularly matter if the movie had a plot or not.  This is a film about images, and very vivid images at that.  Some are funny, most are cruel and unforgiving (the young Pink walking through the bombed out trenches in search of his father).  This is a movie that just has to be seen.
0767903862|4.0|Once called &quot;the Lucky Country,&quot; Australia may wonder if the designation still applies after Bryson's string of visits.  Sunburned Country isn't a travel guide.  It's a traveler's journal.  This makes the book a bit difficult to assess.  It's usually displayed in the Travel section of your local bookstore.  If you're looking for recommendations of places to stay, you'll find little guidance here.  If you're looking for places to visit, this book is a treasure.  If you're looking for a good read, it's doubly a treasure.  If you already have feelings about Australia, pro or con, then this book is certain to arouse ire.  You cannot leave this book unmoved.  Besides, for all its shortcomings, it's a fun read.<br />Divided into segments due to intermittent trips across the Equator, Bryson manages to present his journeys as a nearly continuous narrative.  Americans travel journalists are uniformly surprised by the size of Australia, and Bryson's no exception.  His travels around Australia are at a frenetic pace trying to cover the ground.  He's dismayed to discover Brisbane isn't &quot;just up the coast&quot; from Sydney.  Five minutes with a map would have disabused him of that myopic view.  He seems always in haste, his pace leaving little opportunity for serendipitous exploration.  Mostly standard travel fare, he targets the urban sites: Sydney, Brisbane, Adelaide, Perth, Darwin, Perth and The Alice.  A couple of exceptions will be noted.<br />Bryson is concerned with his comfort.  He never camps, preferring hotel/motel convenience - they usually have, or are near to, pubs.  For most of the book he's on the road from one town to the next.  The result, particularly driving from Darwin to the Alice, allows no time for close examination of what he terms &quot;featureless&quot; and &quot;inexhaustible&quot; deserts.  A little more research might have directed him to the Red Center's fascinating variety.  But you have to stop the car and walk around a bit to accomplish that.  Part of the reason he failed to make even brief  saunters is his nearly pathological fear of Australia's fauna.  The worst aspect of this book is Bryson's litany of Australia's dangerous creatures.  From the box jellyfish through taipans to the infamous redback spider [which he incorrectly describes], he presents the reader with numerous examples of how careless people have suffered their defense of territory.  There's a strange ambivalence here, since he's clearly enthralled by many aspects of Australia's natural wonders.  His circumvention of Uluru [Ayer's Rock] comprises but two hours, all of it by vehicle.  He's disappointed with the monolith's colour, unaware of the impact of changing light on The Rock.<br />Yet, on occasion, when he deems it safe, he alights, closely viewing some of the natural wonders.  How many travel writers have the acuity to visit [and recommend] Hamelin Pool in Western Australia?  As Bryson is at pains to point out, Hamelin Pool should be one of the premier World Heritage sites.  It contains one of the few sites where the original organisms leading to writers and readers [after some 3.5 thousand million years] still reside.  It would have been an experience to stand beside him as he explained this phenomenon to the tourist woman who disparaged what she observed.  Bryson, bless him, relies heavily on Richard Fortey's LIFE; AN UNAUTHORIZED BIOGRAPHY in educating this woman.  He could find few better authorities to use.  And he believes what he writes.<br />As a travel writer, he deals with many people.  Hotel clerks, restaurant waitresses, museum tenders and other tourist contacts.  As in any country, there are the good ones and the others.  He's forthright in his assessments, but his comfort and convenience stand paramount.  He's good at laughing at himself, especially in regard to his fear of venomous creatures.  Mostly the journeys are solitary, but his trips to the Barrier Reef and along the highway from Darwin to Alice Springs are in company with journalist Allan Sherwin.  It becomes another chance to expound on the wildlife - particularly the deadlier forms.  Among his chants of dangerous fauna, he manages to provide numerous historical anecdotes.  He truly shines here, bringing to life people who have crossed the Australian scene.  From the first Dutch landings [where stranded mutineers gained notoriety as the first white &quot;settlers&quot;] to the &quot;dullest man in Australia [Prime Minister John Howard], Bryson fills in details on places and events.  If nothing else, these vignettes provide excellent background material for his travels.  It may be enough to prompt reading another Bryson book.  There's a wealth of them to choose from.rings are in company with journalist Allan Sherwin.  It becomes another chance to expound on the wildlife - particularly the deadlier forms.

B00005JKMO|4.0|After all the years and the hyperbole, the marriages, the knockouts, the championship bouts lost, won and regained... there stands at the center of Michael Mann's &quot;Ali,&quot; the man himself, Mohammed Ali. But what we may have forgotten is that Mohammed Ali was first and foremost an honorable and brave man, though flawed and human like the rest of us.<br />Who among us would go up against the United States Government and the Draft Board by refusing to serve in a war in which he did not believe; thereby risking 5 years in Federal Prison, losing 3 years of his prime boxing life and subsequent lost earnings...and all out of deeply felt religious and humanitarian reasons. Ali's boxing life notwithstanding, this is ultimately the importance and the relevance of Mann's &quot;Ali,&quot; which is not so much a boxing film in the sense that &quot;Raging Bull&quot; is, but a film about a Champion and the machinations, perserverance, personality, drive and more importantly the sacrifices necessary to achieve this exalted professional position.<br />Michael Mann has given the film an appropriate grainy, almost newsreel look which emphasizes the sweaty, muscular milieu he is trying to portray.  But I think Mann's touch is most apparent in the performance of Will Smith as Mohammed Ali. I was extremely skeptical that Smith, heretofore a light comedian/rapper, could handle the emotional weight of such a role. I was wrong. Smith gives a towering,eloquent performance filled with the requisite heart and soul as well as the necessary bragadaccio necessary to pull off this portrayal of one of the most famous people of the the 20th century.<br />In supporting roles, Jon Voight as Howard Cosell, Jamie Fox as Drew Brown and Ron Silver as Angelo Dundee all do excellent work in roles that not only support Smith/Ali but do so with a kind of truth not often seen on the screen.<br />&quot;Ali&quot; runs into the most trouble, I think when it attempts too much: the Jada Pinkett-Smith as Sonji Roy, Ali's first wife storyline simply doesn't make sense as well as the Malcolm X (Mario Van Peebles) storyline: very powerfully enacted but motivationally murky here as well.<br />Michael Mann and Will Smith have done a bang-up job capturing Mohammed Ali's tumultuous life on film and I will not hestitate to speculate that the Man himself cannot help but be complimented by the results.Ali's first wife storyline simply doesn't make sense as well as the Malcolm X (Mario Van Peebles) storyline: very powerfully enacted but motivationally murky here as well.<BR>Michael Mann and Will Smith have done a bang-up job capturing Mohammed Ali's tumultuous life on film and I will not hestitate to speculate that the Man himself cannot help but be complimented by the results.
B00003CXXS|4.0|Hey, am I the only person in the world that could not get this movie to work in Dolby Digital 5.1 in English?  I ended up buying 2 copies (will return both if I can't get a solution to my problem)and the only soundtrack that I could get to work was in FRENCH!  I watched the entire movie with subtitles.<br />I though the movie was ok.  I thought the first two Jurassic Parks [stunk], so I didn't expect much.  The first two were a little too Indiana Jonesish for me.  You know, all kinds of action but no one really gets hurt.  This one I thought was the best of the bunch, but I had to watch it in FRENCH!  I don't know French, I studied Latin in school (thank God it wasn't in Latin!!)<br />The equipment I used was a Panasonic DVD, Model DVD-A110 and a Denon Receiver model 1802.
B00004XQ83|5.0|I loved this cd. I liked the movie but the music is what drew me to the movie.  I'm a southern girl at heart and this music makes me want to go home to the hills. A friend and I were listening to this cd while making Christmas cookies and I made a remark about the style of music and she answered back with &quot;I wouldn't expect anything else, now I know where the y'all, reckon and yonder comes from&quot;. If your not a fan of bluegrass or old time mountain music this cd is not for you, however, give it a try anyway you might be surprised. I especially liked Allison Kraus's &quot;Down in the river to pray&quot;.
0385505833|2.0|A good storyline, as can be expected from John Grisham, but Skipping Christmas definitely lacks the substance of most of his previous works.  It's an easy read as the book is quite short.  Worth borrowing a copy but not something you'll go back to if it's on your bookshelf.  Skipping Christmas has the feel of a last-minute push by a publisher to &quot;get one in the aisles&quot; before the holiday shopping rush.  Save your money.
B00005OM4N|5.0|When &quot;...Baby One More Time&quot; came out I was instantly hooked to the music and dance talent of the lovely Britney Spears.  When &quot;Oops...I Did It Again&quot; arrived I fell in deeper to her music.  Now with the simply titled &quot;Britney&quot; I find myself amazed at how much Britney's voice and style has changed.  This album is her best yet with the catchy &quot;I'm A Slave 4 U&quot; and &quot;Let Me Be&quot; to the sweet hit &quot;I'm Not A Girl, Not Yet A Woman&quot;.  Vocally, she has reached places shes never been.  I strongly reccomend this album to anyone whose ready for a good time and hot music.  In a world of haters, I wonder how this Kentucky girl stays as sweet and kind to her fans as she is.  With such superstardom as Britney has achieved, she hasn't changed at all and will remain my favorite pop princess.  SO TO ALL YOU HATERS OUT THERE...Let Britney Be.
0452282195|5.0|I originally read this book in 1995.  I have read it about ten times since and it's still good.  It tells the story of a little girl's struggle for acceptance from her mother and society as a whole, which everyone can relate to.
B000056K04|3.0|Every other DMB disc has been a 5* record, so where'd they go wrong?  I'm not sure, but I think it was when they ditched the &quot;big band orchestra&quot; for the more &quot;rock band sound&quot;.  Now I LOVE my Nirvana, Gorillaz, etc., but I also loved my melodic DMB.  I saw them perform some of these songs in concert before the CD was released, and it was good.  Damn good.  But they lost something in the transition to disc.  Anyway, DMB has like 50 full records.  Buy the other 49.  If you have any cash left, THEN you can buy &quot;Everyday&quot;.
B00000JGOJ|1.0|In the last five years or so i've watched a rather abundant number of films like this one.  Yuppie, well-to-do beautiful people who can't find love and are very messed-up, or cynical, or desperate but charming.  Sometimes this formula works (see 200 Cigarettes), sometimes it flops (see Playing by Heart).  The best thing a movie can have is good writing, and that was absent from this one.  The dialogs were contrived, clich&eacute;d  and stale.  The predictability was huge, and the happy ending was tear-inducing.  Sean Connery plays Sean Connery, Dennis Quaid plays Dennis Quaid, Jay Mohr can't act, and Angelina Jolie's break-up phone conversation was unbearable.  The best thing in the movie is the drag queen.  Please pass on this one and go straight to 200 Cigarettes (where Jay Mohr actually does a half-decent job).
B00003CXXS|3.0|This movie was a downfall in ways.  I expected much more out of this movie than what was given. None the less though it was good enough to keep me slightly entertained by it. Certains things bothered me about the movie such as..... 1) The fact that Ellie and Alan didn't get to get together. 2) The parents of the missing boy, they acted as if they didn't even care, among other things. Just didn't live up to my expectations and that is why I could only give it 3 stars.
B00005OM4Q|5.0|He's not only a great writer and director, his knowledge of music is incredible.  And on top of that he's a evidently a really nice person - a director that actors love to work for.
0345448898|5.0|I received The Golden Compass as Christmas present probably 4 years ago (ironic, these books as a Christmas present) and never touched it. Finally I picked it up and read. I was hooked and went out and bought The Subtle Knife only days later, proceeded to devour it, and luckily, The Amber Spyglass has just been released. Wow, these are probably my favorite 3 books ever. And that's saying something, because I've read a LOT of books. The are very obviously Anti-Christian, but never the less, I found the matters discussed very fascinating. Actually, it reminded me a lot of the movie Dogma, believe it or not, thought Dogma was decidely pro-Christian. Anyways, go read these books, they are the best.
B00005JKES|5.0|If there's any one thing that deserves to be on DVD it's TP.  I have the original series edition on VHS and it looks about as crisp as a third generation copy.  God knows I've been waiting for Dale Cooper's face to look less like death than Laura Palmer's. <br />Also, for those 'fans' who are complaining about the missing pilot: even on the VHS series it was a separate entity since it was meant to be just a two-hour movie.  The series was picked up afterwards.  And just like everyone on this board has stated -- you can easily pick up a copy of the pilot at your local video store if you want to catch up.  And true, the pilot will most likely be released later on and cost the same -- if not more -- than the first season.(...)
B00005OC06|3.0|The advent of opera on DVD has been a real boon to neophytes and aficionados of opera alike, as it presents the medium in a way that can only be superseded by a trip to the opera house itself. This Madama Butterfly is a film version of Puccini's beloved opera, and as such it takes certain liberties (obvious lip-synching, and singing when the actors are clearly not singing--the music represents thoughts &quot;in their heads&quot;).  While all of this can be somewhat of a distraction, it is the poor acting, especially of Domingo, that hinders my being able to suspend reality while watching this production--in spite of some outstanding singing from Freni,  Ludwig AND Domingo. Evidence of poor acting begin early on when the viewer actually witnesses Domingo's Pinkerton CHEWING GUM (!) over a stretch of several minutes--very strange indeed, and HIGHLY annoying. Was this a conscious decision or was it a gross oversight? My guess is the latter, for I find nothing artistic or symbolic in it; but it is such inexcusable distractions that ruin portions of this opera for me.  It is as if Domingo is trying too hard to make us loath his character. This is most unfortunate, as  Domingo sings AND acts brilliantly in Rosi's film version of Carmen, which he did about a decade after Butterfly.  While Freni certainly does not look 15, few Butterflys do, and who cares when they sing so ravishingly as she? Freni gives a beautifully convincing performance, and her scenes are the most thrilling by far. The sets and backgrounds are acceptable although for a flim version, they fail to evoke an intense  &quot;Japanese&quot; flavor the way those in Rosi's film version of Carmen do for Andaluca. In conclusion, opera on DVD places more demands on a production: to be truly outstanding, the VISUAL (acting/sets/backgrounds) component must be equal to the singing.  This opera film fails in the first department, but is saved by the singing--which one can get on a CD!
B00001IVOF|5.0|This album is simply the grimiest, most harcore hip hop album ever. The beats are the darkest beats that I have ever heard, and Prodigy is relentless with his lyrics....A vast better album than &quot;Infamy&quot;..
0783117523|5.0|I sat spellbound by Angelina Jolie's performance. I've already become quite a fan, yet without amazon.com's review service I would not even have known that this film existed. What a powerhouse that woman is! How well drawn the characters, how true to life the doomed love story between the desperate Gia and her devoted, heartsick girlfriend. There is no competing with addiction. How difficult for her mother to refuse to let her come home knowing the dangers involved. &quot;How can you tell when a junkie is lying?&quot; she quips, &quot;Their lips are moving.&quot;<br />It's only too true.<br />I particularly loved the statements made in reference to the beauty/fashion industry itself, what it does to women, both within the industry and those who are influenced by it. It reminded me of the Jean Kilbourne lecture &quot;Still Killing Us Softly,&quot; which should be mandated viewing for anyone invested in media literacy.<br />&quot;We like them to look dead,&quot; says one of the photographers in the film. The fashion industry is a horrendous, misogynist behemoth that takes women in, chews them up and spits them out, and defines how women are &quot;supposed&quot; to look, live and love.<br />And who makes the real money?<br />Women express themselves by the way they look, Willhemina tells Gia. The less they say, the better.<br />And silence, as they say, is death.
B000002UC5|4.0|With two Beatles gone now, I've been digging up old albums and I was surpised at how well this holds up.  After the studio wizardry of Abbey Road, who'd expect Paul to release a record of tossed-off home recordings with one mike and a four-track in Scotland?  The album's a textbook of pop arrangement that culminates in the classic &quot;Baby I'm Amazed&quot;. But it also shows the problems he'd run in to without John and George to say no:  pointless prettiness (&quot;Junk&quot;) and good ideas that collapse into syrupy changes (&quot;Teddy Boys&quot;).  For all John's complaints that Paul was too slick, he showed more courage in releasing one-offs than the others, who turned to Phil Spector to make it big and Beatlish.  These doodles, caught at Paul's peak, show an intimacy that few other solo works capture.  It's Paul as Paul, warts and all.  Enjoy.
0525946284|3.0|While the style of this book is reminiscent of Follett's stellar \\"Eye of the Needle\\", it is a poor story, more poorly written.  Many of Follett's novels maintain a stream of reality and snippets of history throughout the text.  In Jackdaws, reality or realism is abandoned in favor of a romp through the same make-believe world that Dorothy found in Oz.  I can find Dorothy, the Lion, the Scarecrow, and the Tin Man, but I have yet to identify Toto.  By the end of the book, I truly hoped Dorothy (a.k.a. Flick) would break a nail, at least.  Sorry Ken, a \\"girl-scout\\" troupe with no training and less discipline, did not win the war.  <br />Who is the hero or heroine here?  Is this a study in the moral ambiguity of war, or ethical relativism?  Flick is ultimately not a likable character; after a fair start in the book, she turns out to be more mercenary than the Gestapo.  The writing follows this incoherent tone throughout.  One chapter ends with blood and guts, while the next starts with high tea and a discussion of dress hemming.  This is not artistic or dramatic contrast, it's just bad.<br />The character that comes closest to being a real and believable person is Dieter Franck.  He of course is the evil Nazi antagonist, I think?  Therein lies one of the most significant problems with the book.  Dieter could actually be the hero, who many times his struggles with real professional and emotional dilemmas, evokes sympathy.  But he's on the wrong side?  In the meantime, Flick, who I believe Follett means to be the heroine, is shallow, self-absorbed, and really unlikable.  In the end, the reader is left totally unsatisfied by the story and unhappy with Follett's stumbling text.  Only those who really want to read another \\"Nazis bad-British good\\" comic book will find enjoyment here.
B00001R3HX|4.0|This is a great album.  For someone who likes Pink Floyd, you will enjoy this.  It is wonderful from beginning to end.  The opener 'The music you are listening to...' is a great start to this CD.  Followed by 'Synesthesia' and 'Always never', the band plunges into music bliss the way I think The Grateful Dead or other bands may have done in the past.  This band has no similarity with the Grateful Dead but the way they meld these songs together only reminds me of the best (who was the Grateful Dead).  Songs like Not beautiful anymore and 'Small fish' follow.  'Small fish' goes into 'Burning Sky', which is another 5 star song.<br />If you like progressive music and/or PF, please give these guys a try.  You will be forever pleased.-
B00003CXWV|5.0|I got this DVD for Christmas. It's two days later, and I've already watched it three times, including the infinifilm inserts. I'm a big fan of Johnny Depp, but that's not it. I love the music, but that's not it. And I'm no big fan of cocaine.<br />I like the movie because it does not glorify, nor does it condemn, drug use per se. In many ways it just is, and has been, for a very long time. It has a lot to do with the 'market' that exists, and that has been exploited for the money.<br />I loved Jung's relationship with his father, as it was portrayed. His father did not understand what he was doing, but did not judge him. It was clear to me that, at least as the story was told in the movie, Jung was trying to make enough money to keep the women in his life happy, having experienced recurring abandonment by his mother over the issue of money. Drugs are, if nothing else, about money and power. Just ask anyone in the government who will tell you.<br />I also liked the awareness I got about the drug economy in Colombia, a basically poor country without the economy of drugs. Dig a little deeper, though you won't find the information in this movie, and you will know why. My country creates these economies, and then exploits them. Why? For money and power. This is supposed to be a democracy, but nobody asked me. I would have voted against anything like that. Lots of people would, if they understood it.<br />At a time when the cocaine explosion took off, there was a great deal of support for it. Without that support, it would not have happened. It then got corrupted, but you would have to read the book *Barry and the Boys* to see how that happened.<br />Still and all, though, I liked the message of the movie. There is money and power in the industry, but it costs a lot more than it is worth, depending on what you value. It's a powerful movie, though perhaps not for everyone.<br />I particularly liked the cameo appearance by Bobcat Goldthwaite. I didn't even recognize him until the third time around. He doesn't look good. But then, in the movie, he wasn't supposed to.ntil the third time around. He doesn't look good. But then, in the movie, he wasn't supposed to.
B00005LMBK|5.0|Gorillaz combine a hard rock style with hip hop to produce a spectacular audio experience. High-tech rythm mixed in with the experience of Blur give rise to a masterful compilation - and that with only two &quot;non-virtual&quot; members in the band. Gorillaz have become highly successful with their first album, which, if I may say so, isn't bad listening for those who enjoy groups such as Blink 182, Offspring, Limp Bizkit or any other alternative rock groups. A definite &quot;go and buy it&quot; album.
B00005JKT8|4.0|For a feel-good experience, this movie fits the bill. It's romantic comedy blended with a little fantasy (time-travel), and in many ways, is also a love letter to Manhattan. And in these times, that's most welcome! The only negative to me is that Meg Ryan, while no doubt a very talented actress, has done this kind of role many times before, and maybe it's time for her to try other character-types. As for Hugh Jackman, this movie more than makes up for &quot;Swordfish&quot;! I had to keep reminding myself that this was the same man who played Wolverine in &quot;X-Men&quot;. He's definitely one of the more talented imports from Down Under!
B0000028RR|5.0|great album, very solid, and almost flawless. if u want to buy another rage cds get The Battle of L.A. the other albums arent as good but still okay. recomended song- settle for nothing, bombtrack,and bullet in the head<br />this album should have got an award or atlest a nonintee,instead of Evil Empire
B00003CXTG|5.0|I regret not seeing it in the Theatre now, I should know better then to listen to the critics. It was a great movie to watch with the kids and explain to them such a terrible event as it happened to the United States. I felt the casting was exceptional and the special effects made my hair stand on end- while the romance made my heart ache. In DVD with 5.1 surround-sound it will blow you away. It was  \\"Titanic meets Tora Tora Tora\\" and I have to watch it again. My late Father-in-law was a survivor of Pearl Harbor in his teens, he said he saw the whole event from under a mooring as he was returning to his ship when the attack occurred and the stories he told me were incredible. Too bad he passed away before he could see the turning point in his life and our Nation put into such a marvelous film.To the producers, crew and cast- THANK YOU.
0446608955|4.0|This was such a refreshing and uplifting read! I came away from this book thinking of all the things I could do for others. Jamie is such a memorable character and someone that all of us should strive to be more like! The love story is believable and endearingly innocent.
B00005O3VC|5.0|Hi my name is Andrew and I am 12 years old. this is my #2 favorite movie and my friend Claire's favorite movie too. This movie is so funny that your arm will fall off but do not worry it will just be a flesh wound and you will get better. My favorite scenes are the tale of sir lancelot (you stay here till I get back) the killer rabbit (run away run away!) and I love the french people (you cheesey second handed british donkey bottom bitters.I unplug my nose in your general direction). I love the black knight (oh its just a flesh wound)and much more there is never a boring second with Monty Python. So you had better buy it cause it is funnier than you can shake a coconut at. I love the special edition. It has a scene where it is all made out of legos, and a scene in Japanese,and a sing a long like with the brave brave Sir Robin song, and so much more! tThis is one of the best movies.  You had better buy it or I will say NI! at you.
B00002MZ2C|5.0|this is rage's most powerful albums. this is worthy of being called as good or even better the the first album.they use all of their talents in this album not like in Evil Empire. Battle of L.A. is a must have. it has and always will be in my cd player right next to Rage's first album. recomended songs- testify,guerrllia radio, maria, and war within a breath.<br />what are u waiting for go get it!!
B0000025ZK|3.0|As a fan of Pink Floyd, my favorite part of the band has always been David Guilmour's guitar licks along with Rick Wrights trademark keybord sounds. On this album, songs like Lets get metaphysical and All lovers are deranged had those kind of moments. Out of the Blue was a nice ballad. Blue Light has a good solo, but like the rest of the album is to much of an attempt to be pop instead of artistic. Overall, it is a good effort and good for a Pink Floyd fan, yet not essential. David Gilmour's 1978 solo album is a much better reflexion of him as a musician and not so pop oriented
B00005QFHG|5.0|This movie was really very beautiful. The actors were very good, and I must add Johnny Depp was gorgeous in this movie! You should definately check this movie out and make sure you have a lot of choclate on hand, trust me, you'll be craving it mid-way through!
B0000028RR|5.0|if u are new to rage and want to listen to there music start with this album. it is totaly solid and flawless! if u are a true mucis fan then u will love this cd .recomended songs- bullet in the head, bombtrack, and settle for nothing(it is the most personal song u can write).
B00004BZ0N|5.0|Music lovers from all walks of life and listening preference often talk about a `classic' album as something that stands the test of time.  The Clash's masterpiece,  London Calling not only stands the test of time, it still sounds fresh, exciting, innovative, and groundbreaking. This statement becomes even more impressive when one considers the fact that the record was recorded more than twenty years ago, in 1979. <br />There is so much passion and energy resting in this album. First track, &quot;London Calling&quot; with its loud, choppy guitar riffs and gritty vocals is a rock classic, an a incendiary way to start an ambitious album. Track five, &quot;Rudie Can't Fail&quot; is a fine introduction into the ska style that others (The Specials, The Toasters, as well as any third wave ska/punk acts) will adopt for the decades to come, and track 19, &quot;Train in Vain&quot; is a bonafide new wave classic recognizable to almost anyone who grew up in the 80's. <br />But London Calling would not be what it is (a fantastic album) if it didn't have a lot to say as well. Clash = Dumb British punks? Not bloody likely. Listen to track six, &quot;Spanish Bombs&quot; and decide for yourself. Not many punk bands incorporate both English and Spanish dialects competently, much less sing historically accurate songs. The Clash does both here. They rant against consumerism and inflation on &quot;Lost in the Supermarket&quot;, inner city violence &quot;Guns of Brixton&quot; and high class coke users &quot;Koka Kola&quot; as well. Nonetheless, beyond all the commentary, they still push on optimistically with &quot;Death or Glory&quot; and &quot;I'm not Down&quot;, with the former being one of the most underrated rock songs in the Clash's reportoire. <br />Once hailed the &quot;only band that matters&quot; the Clash certainly left their imprint on the punk and popular music scenes, and their legacy continues to grow. Though often not containing the prettiest (but perhaps some of the grittiest and most British) vocals of its time, the Clash's unquestionably influential London Calling is a rock classic and a must have for any one wishing to assemble a solid music collection.
0767830555|4.0|Martin Scorsese's 'Taxi Driver' is a most graphic and harrowing tale of loneliness and its effect on the human psyche. <BR>Robert De Niro, the most versatile and talented actor ever in my opinion, plays Travis a man so plagued with insomnia he turns to taxi driving to while away the late hours. <BR>In a job not usually associated with isolation, Travis, a misanthrope, feels a sense of solitude that is almost inexplicable. A man who finds it impossible to articulate his feelings, the slow degenerative process of rationalisation leads him to question his very being. With so much time to think, sickened at the state of New York City, Travis sees an opportunity to be someone - a self appointed bringer of justice.<BR>This is not a pleasant film. In fact, it's the ugly tale of a man's sedulous quest for purpose culminating in extreme, explicit violence. <BR>It's a frightening, grim and true-to-life film; an historic monument in cinematography, but those of a nervous disposition may prefer to give it a miss.<br />In respect to the actual DVD, it, like most DVDs is impressive. The 70 minute documentary that compliments it, gives a clear insight into the mind of the director and his motives for being involved in such a controversial movie.
B00001XT76|5.0|This has to be the most beautiful love story I have ever seen.I have had the movie forever on VHS,but now I have it on DVD.This movie takes a young girl into the wilder side of life.There is a love scene in this movie to die for and it is not to graphic,but enough to make you wish you were there.The ending of this movie ends exactly like alove story should.Patrick Swayzee and Jennifer Gray would make me very,very happy to do a sequeal.
B00005JKQX|5.0|What a movie!! It was the perfect Christmas gift that I gave to myself.  This movie is worth seeing. C'est magnific!! <BR>A Beautiful Mind, with extraordinary dialogue sequences and its unique sense of humor is far away from being overdramatic. Revealing with an unpredictable score, the movie was exceptionally well driven (or directed) from the beginning to its very emotional and elegant end.  Russell Crowe is intense, fascinating and moving.  With his splendid touch, Crowe gave John Forbes Nash his lovable human side.  No doubt that this particular personality needed a great actor with a beautiful mind. &quot;Russell Crowe. Gaude, actor singularis splendidus!&quot; <BR>The great talents of supporting actors Connelly, Harris and Bettany gave the movie its balance. Balance needed to give to a very well written script its substance, and to make the whole movie enjoyable. This movie gave me much more than what I expected to get.  Good enough to make a great deal of sense to  me. That's the reason why I know say that the movie A Beautiful Mind is &quot;Super Omnes Speciosa.&quot;

0451191153|4.0|What's philosophy? Its most often a truth which is relevant within a range, taken out of its context , blown out of proportion to fit into all aspects of life and given a name.There is a certain amount of seductiveness to all philosophical schools.When you read them you tend to fall into the trap, atleast momentarily and Fountainhead is no exception. <BR> Well here the truth is world can be divided into two camps.The geniuses who are often ridiculed, but who form the pillars of civilization and the second raters who live through their lives sucking through the efforts of the former.The name given to this brand is &quot;Objectivism&quot;.<BR> Two characters Howard Roark, representing the genius camp and Ellsworth Toohy representing the later , Peter Keating an example of traditional orthodox brilliance , and an enigmatic Dominique make up the story.Architecture is the leitmotiv.While Keating tends to see it the traditional conformist way, the genius in Roark tends to see through the phoniness in most of traditional architecture.His designs tend to be radical and because of the same find little acceptance among his <BR>contemporaries.Fiercly  individualistic he persists with his ideas.Ellsworth Toohy is the second  rater who exploits the talents of the first raters.<BR> The concept is heavy and writing is sometimes inconsistent and  incoherent.The literary quality is way below other philosophical novels  like &quot;Crime and Punishment&quot;, for example.But inspite of the novel's shortcomings you cannot but help get influenced and moved by its power.And this is exactly where Ayn Rand triumphs.

B00004VVNE|5.0|When machines break down and accidentally unleash the nuclear genie out of the bottle, it's up to the President(brilliantly played by Henry Fonda) and his top military and government officials to prevent all-out war. Tensions heighten when military men like Colonel Cascio(Fritz Weaver) crack under the strain; a civilian &quot;hawk&quot; (Walter Matthau) argues for total committment while a military pacifist General(Dan O'Herlihy) adamantly insists that unleashing the H-Bomb would spell the end of the world. When it becomes clear the B-58 Vindicator Bombers mistakenly sent against Moscow will reach their target, the President must make the gravest sacrifice to prevent Armageddon. Lumet's directing and the all-star cast bring to life a nightmare situation that almost happened a number of times in real life. Well worth your viewing!
0385505833|4.0|This book was so UNGrishamlike, but had his usual attention holding style.  I completely indentified with the whole idea of too much spending at Christmas and it was SOOOOOOOOOO realistic.  How many times have you rewrapped gifts and passed them on to someone else or let them hang in the closet when someone else could use them?  Skipping Christmas was an adults version of How the Grinch Stole Christmas  but had a delightful ending in which the main characters heart grew two sizes that day. Great Christmas story!
B00005QDW1|1.0|No Doubt took the rock right out of &quot;Rock Steady&quot; on this one! With over 600 CDs in my collection, I've never felt the need to return a purchase I've made...until now. To compare this CD to No Doubt's previous recordings, you would never think that this was the same band.<br />Now, if you're into keyboard-laden, disco/hip-hop, NON-ROCK tunes this might be the CD for you. But if it's good guitar riffs, or ANY guitar riffs that you'd expect from a &quot;rock&quot; CD... keep on looking. Tom Dumont is nearly impossible to find on this recording.<br />This review may sound harsh, but I am actually a huge No Doubt fan. I can only hope that this &quot;tragic recording&quot; was an experiment, and for their next CD they will &quot;return to earth&quot; and give us something great to listen to... again.
B00005OM4N|5.0|i hated britney till my sister wanted her last cd as a christmas present. hated the songs stronger, dont last..., ooopsss...<BR>i listened the cd and that made me dance.i like to dance so i dont mind the lyrics and just dance.but the lyrics are not as bad as in the 2nd album.they are about being sexy.i strongly advice to britney to write some songs out of this sexy image.<BR>i think her new image is good.but she has to stop saying that she's grown up.she made a song cAlled im not a girl not yet a woman but i didnt like this song. i think a person can show that he/she has grown up by his/her movements not with a song.<BR>im slave for you is a dance hit i think.and itis good.but i like the anticipating and overprotected.they are awesome.<BR>as a result you cant find songs like the albums that she had made before.and i think youd like it.you can hear the songs...so you can understand that im right or not.<BR>note:some people say that she is using her body.i think she is beautiful and there is no problem for us (britney fans). dont forget that madonna used her body too.
B000003JAB|5.0|Trower- Bridge of Sighs<br />A truly unique record for all time, 'Bridge of Sighs' is perhaps the best non-Zep heavy offering of the period. Although many considered Trower's sound here to be merely Hendrix-esque, it was, and is, unique.<br />1974 was, at once, a bounty and a bit of a no-man's land for hard rock. Zep took a big break, and Cooper's 'Muscle of Love', while great, left a massive opening for Trower and this record. 'Bridge' was THE heavy record of the year. But it was, and is, much more.<br />Completely original tonal dynamics, brilliant songwriting, and literally-perfect musicianship are the hallmarks of this fantastic effort. Every song is, at once, mellow and heavy. This goes not only to outstanding production, but also to perfect conception and execution on the part of  the Trower power trio itself. Rock somehow came of age on this record. It owes nothing to any other band of the time; in that alone, this album is an unqualified success.<br />A disc without 'hits', this album was, nevertheless, the stalwart of AOR DJs during the summer of  '74, and beyond,  and was a surprisingly-smashing commercial success, sold by the near-millions at stores for approximately $5.00. Go figure.<br />For those seeking the Roots of Rock in the 1970's, buy this one, for sure...<br />'Day of the Eagle' opens the record, and a new time: a time when every great new record destroyed what came before. A real groove, clearly distinct from Zep, Sabbath, and Aerosmith in all ways, this song gets right down to business immediately without pretense, and crushes previously-standard time signatures in deference to a truly new sound. This fact cannot be overstated.<br />With its rolling pull-off start, the title track follows. Nicely-depressing, droning, and slow, the stage is set. If you were stoned, young, and 'there', this was IT. If not, the album may lack some meaning, but it's still awesome. A  tricky fade gives rise to the next, slower than molasses, bluesy track, and all that follows: rare, utter perfection.<br />An awesome A+ collection ensues. This is neither Plant nor Osborne, Page nor Blackmore. Here, Trower shreds through his new sound, but always relinquishes before becoming self-indulgent. Everything flows like the perfect trip. Perhaps the greatest compliment that can be given to this record is the fact that no one attempted to copy it. It was, in some critics' eyes, the capstone of a very brief, but incredibly cool time. <br />Trower's original chord choices, and tunes, make this thing. The vocals of Dewar are monumentally outstanding (listen!), but I'm selling Trower, the guitarist, without remorse. Not a tough sell.<br />Bluesy, but not blues, the buzzy set will take control of all who listen, with heretofore undone syncopation, and the album-wide restatement of the real birth of a new phase-shifted sound. Andy Summers, for better or worse, eat your heart out. <br />For you kids, this is a must-have. Everyone else, you've got it, rotting in your basement. Rediscover it on CD.
B000002ADT|5.0|Somewhere between 4 and 5 stars.  I have had this for several weeks now though it is my only Miles Davis CD.  I enjoy it quite a bit and I think this CD will have very good replay value over time (a very good test IMO). The pieces are not ones to tire of easily and my hope is that I am able to continue hearing this for a long time.<br />The other reviews may get your expectations too high (&quot;best jazz CD&quot; etc) but go ahead and get it, give it at least a few listens - you will not regret it.
B000002H97|5.0|After the muddled production and ultra-complicated song structures of ...And Justice For All, Metallica decided that they had taken the progressive elements of their music as far as they could, and that a simplification and streamlining of their sound was in order.  The best songs are more melodic and immediate, the crushing, stripped-down grooves of &quot;Enter Sandman,&quot; &quot;Sad But True,&quot; and &quot;Wherever I May Roam&quot; sticking to traditional structures and using the same main riffs throughout; the crisp, professional production by Bob Rock adds to their accessibility. &quot;The Unforgiven&quot; and &quot;Nothing Else Matters&quot; avoid the slash-and-burn guitar riffs that had always punctuated the band's ballads.   While there are alot of objections to metallica doing anything remotely mainstream, millions more have disagreed. In fact, the band's popularity exploded so much that most of their back catalog found mainstream acceptance in its own right, while other progressively inclined speed-metal bands copied the move toward simplification.   Metallica/Metallica while not their greatest album, is damn good, and helped capture the heavy metal crown for metallica.
0790746905|4.0|FORBIDDEN PLANET is certainly one of the most influential films of the 20th Century, containing an unusual story line, some remarkable concept art designs, a superior musical score, and a special effects robot that set the standard for science-fiction films for some thirty years and still continues to influence film makers today.  Unfortunately, the film is also a very static one, ultimately less interesting for any sense of excitement than for purely visual appeal.<br />In general, the story--which is famous for being very loosely based on Shakespeare's THE TEMPEST--concerns a deep space mission helmed by Leslie Nielson sent to relieve colonists of a distant planet. Upon arriving, they find only two survivors: an inhospitable Walter Pidgeon and his beautiful daughter Anne Francis.  Pidgeon warns the relief mission against landing on the planet, lest the mysterious and evil force that destroyed the original colonists be once more unleashed, but land they do... and soon they too fall victim to an unseen but fearsome killer.<br />There are many marvelous things about the film.  The robot--suggested by Shakespeare's character Ariel--is truly the single most enjoyable element of the film, with much of the film's best lines and a memorable personality to boot.  Anne Francis--again suggested by Shakespeare's Miranda--gives quite a remarkable performance as a beautiful young woman raised without knowledge of mankind.  The art designs, whether of the lost alien civilization, the home in which Pideon and Francis live, or Francis' costumes, are stunning.  Even so...<br />Perhaps it is more a matter of passing time than anything else.  Both Nielson and Pidgeon's performances seem unnecessarily restrained and the cinematography is extremely static. The film as a whole seems to lack excitement and, although intriguing, the story itself is handled in a very conventional way.  Fans of classic science fiction cannot afford to be without FORBIDDEN PLANET, and most viewers will enjoy seeing it at least once, but for all its influence and visual beauty many may find that one viewing is enough.<br />Word of Warning: make absolutely certain that you are purchasing the widescreen version of the film, for the pan-and-scan seriously undercuts the film's visual appeal.seeing it at least once, but for all its influence and visual beauty many may find that one viewing is enough.<br />Word of Warning: make absolutely certain that you are purchasing the widescreen version of the film, for the pan-and-scan seriously undercuts the film's visual appeal.
0783235968|5.0|This one is a classic! =) I started to watch it, thinking it would be stupid, but I was wrong. It's an outstanding movie. When Ray Kinsella starts hearing voices, he disregards them for a while, but they become impossible to ignore. He builds a beautiful baseball field in accordance with the wills of the &quot;voices,&quot; and things really start heating up when famous, deceased baseball players from the past like &quot;Shoeless&quot; Joe Jackson come to play on the field. The discovery of a famous, yet secluded author and an elderly doctor who never got anywhere in baseball heightens suspense and excitement in the movie. You don't want to miss this one--it's great. =) Amy Madigan does well in her role as Ray's supportive wife, and Gaby Hoffmann is adorable as little Karen, the daughter of Ray and Amy who is a faithful believer of everything that happens as soon as Ray starts hearing the voices. It is actually her faith that may help some other headstrong characters to believe! =) What can I say? It's an awesome movie and you gotta see it!!!! It really is just as good as all the critics have said.
B00000K0DV|4.0|The New York Ripper is an exceptionally violent portrayal of a murderer loose in a sleaze ridden NYC.<br />As such it is a fantastic film particularly if a) you love early '80s NYC as a setting, b) neon-generated sleaze, and c) a dated and cheap electro funk score. Oh, and it also helps if you admire poor dubbing.<br />Anchor Bay's DVD transfer is fine- the odd blemish but considering the film's age and type, thoroughly commendable.<br />Exploitation fans will be delighted while this film should be avoided by moral crusaders.

0393317552|5.0|When I find a book particularly compeling, I prefer to read the reviews that pan the book to see what other people think.  I guess I can sum up the 1-star reviews into roughly 3 camps (although of course this summary is biased and not comprehensive):<br />1)  &quot;This book is BORING!  Can I go out to play now?&quot; or &quot;He doesn't write well.  Why does he keep repeating himself?&quot;  <br />2)  Diamond is a PC liberal left-leaning commie pinko who hates white people.  Isn't it obvious we're just smarter?<br />3)  Diamond's models can't account for China/Incas/Hitler/Einstein/take your pick of historical event.  <br />In my opinion...<br />1)  Criticism 1 is a matter of personal taste, which is what reviews are for, so I guess I can't really comment.<br />2)  Diamond is PC:  I find these types of criticism the most annoying.  It is a completely empty criticism that is about as helpful as someone saying that Bill Bennett is a Nazi.  But some people seem to take offense that Diamond even raises the question of proximal causes of European preeminence.  By raising these questions no one is necessarily denigrating European culture or society.  In fact, Diamond goes to great lengths to show how displacement and genocide have happened to groups throughout the world throughout history, committed by groups from all parts of the world.  I thought he was emphasizing, for good or ill, our common humanity.  If suggesting that Europeans have common humanity with everyone else is too demeaning and PC to some people, I think that reaction speaks for itself.<br />3)  Several people have pointed out that Diamond's central thesis, thumbnailed as geography is destiny, is inadequate for a lot of questions.  Sure it is.  But I'm sure Diamond would admit that no one theory or set of ideas could explain all of history.  In some sense, I think he was suggesting at the end of his book that this work is a brave early attempt at trying to use more &quot;hard&quot; scientific parameters(such as zoology, botany, geology, etc.) in the study of broad patterns of human history.  Also, Diamond is careful to couch his arguments in very broad, sweeping terms, which is what most of the focus of his argument is about.  He discusses &quot;Eurasians&quot; as compared to &quot;Americans&quot; or &quot;Australians&quot;; many of the criticisms expressed by people here are speaking of events and arguments that are far more specific than that.  Of course others have worked on this as well, but this book is at least something of a breakthrough because Diamond has managed to articulate very interesting ideas to a lay audience.  <br />One doesn't, of course, have to agree with Diamond on everything, but I do think that a lot of the negative feedback here either missed the point of the book or was criticizing it for what it was not intended to be.
B00005R2M3|5.0|This is an outstanding CD.  It is so good to hear a young talented singer that can really belt out a throaty song with gusto!  This is not your &quot;Britney Spears&quot;, &quot;Jennifer Lopez&quot; Fare. This music has heart and soul.  I Just Love Objection, Whenever, wherever, Te Aviso Anuncio, plus several others on the CD.  I accidentally stumbled onto the music of Shakira on the internet one evening and was immediately entranced by such songs as Ojos Asi, and others.  This CD does not disappoint.  Quick, order one...!!!
B00005QZ7U|4.0|Okay, going into this I was unsure of what to expect. I loved Baz's Romeo and Juliet, but a musical? A genre not really done now? In the opening sequence I was overwhelmed. Everything moved so quickly! So much music, dancing, craziness. But as the story began to unfold I became engrossed. It is well acted, the songs chosen move the story along so beautifully, the colorful characters, sets, and costumes are gorgeous! As for the singing voices of the actors, while they may not be the best, I thought they did a good job. After seeing this film I watched the second disc, which is what DVD's are meant to be! So much to see! And so many hidden treasures! The extras on here are enough to make this worth buying! It puts other DVDs to shame! Baz really knows what viewers want and he delivers. After getting more background on story, etc. on the second disc it made the movie even better. I now see why the opening was the way it was. The Moulin Rouge was so complex and Baz wanted to bring various aspects of it out in the film. This one HAS to have several nominations for Oscars, just as it did for the Golden Globes! I recommend this to anyone who appreciates creativity, beauty, musicals, and a good love story!
B00005QZWI|5.0|If you enjoyed the movie, and if you're into soundtracks, you'll probably like this album.  Not bad, but not on the same level as some other soundtracks like Star Wars Phantom Menace.  So it's worth having, but it's nothing amazing.  A few songs are excellent, but the others are a bit repetative.<BR>If you like this, then you might like soundtracks for: Conan the Barbarian, Gladiator, Jurrassic Park, and Star Wars Phantom Menace.

630326669X|4.0|In many ways, this film is as valuable an account of the Stones and their world and music as Stanley Booth's amazing memoir/biography &quot;The True Adventures of the Rolling Stones.&quot;  And Booth's book, despite the cheesy, alternate title (it was originally called &quot;Dance With The Devil&quot;) is, in itself, a shrewd and articulate literary counterpart to &quot;Gimme Shelter.&quot; <br />But &quot;Sympathy&quot; is a more concentrated glimpse and its focus is on the progression and recording of the title song is, to a fan anyway, fascinating.<br />One thing I find interesting is the many directions this song could've taken. One version is a chilled out, slowed down samba. Another has an ethereal Nicky Hopkins organ melody. And apparently, the line that originally went, &quot;I shouted out 'who killed Kennedy'&quot; had to be changed to &quot;who killed the Kennedys&quot; because Robert Kennedy was assassinated as they were working out the song.<br />Other interesting aspects are the questions this film raises. How long a period does this session cover? A month? A week? Two days? Are we seeing the sessions in chronological order.  Who are all the other people we see milling around while the Stones try to get something done.  We're never told.<br />Plus, it's just cool to see these guys when they were young, looking great and being as close to themselves as they can be with a camera in their face: Mick, waddling around and flubbing lines; Bill, looking like the boredest man in the world; Charlie focused and steady; Brian struggling to arrange a cigarette to smoke; and Keith, like a slim pirate, doing a jaunty step as he fiddles with what will eventually become &quot;Sympathy's&quot; razor-sharp solo.<br />Many viewers take this film to task for the non-music related scenes that are interspersed with the studio sessions: short, verite riffs on celebrity, race, sex, literature, techonology.  I actually liked these sections, though every single one of them goeson about twice as long as it should.  However, these little glimpses outside the studio plant the movie in a particular zone (the end of swinging London as seen through Godard's lens) that give the entire piece a distinct, if consistently unreal, identity.
6305949980|5.0|This film is quite possibly on of the most creative movies ever.  dazziling songs just add to the effect of this wonderful story.  Danny Elfman is one of the most talented people around, not only did he do the voice of jack but he also did all of the music as well as some other minor roles in the film.  Over all i will give this film ***** it deserved every one of them and will be a classic holiday movie for years to come.
B00005QIPH|5.0|These guys are no more the new Velvet Underground or New York Dolls than the Black Crowes were the new Mick Taylor era-Stones.   <br />But it's easy to see why the label has stuck on them so hard. And like the Crowes, they wear their influences on their sleeves, yet they do rock out in a fairly honest manner. <br />Still, the fact that a song like &quot;The Modern Age&quot; sounds a helluva lot like mid-period Velvets wouldn't matter a bit if the song was less than great.  But these songs are all pretty amazing. Each one of them is like a sharp, tight hit single and this album always seems to end a few minutes before I want it to. <br />And, frankly, I hear a multitude of influences in the music here and most of them are bands I like.  First and foremost is a group that I haven't heard mentioned much in comparisons about The Strokes and that would be Pavement.  I personally think these guys sound like Pavement with a hardcore caffeine buzz or, to paraphrase Butthead, they're like Pavement if Pavement tried a little harder.<br />Anyway, when you like a band, your reasons for doing so should be more about sounds and less about magazine articles or internet rumblings or pretty pictures or whatever (though, of course, based on what I just wrote, the fact that you're reading this advice on the internet makes my opinion completely invalid).<br />Nevertheless, disliking a band because they have good promotion is just as ill-advised as loving a band because their singer is cute.  <br />Give this disk a spin if you haven't already.  It won't take you much more than about a half-hour and it might make your day.
0385505833|1.0|I have always enjoyed reading John Grisham and had no reason to think otherwise until I read this book.  As with many &quot;departure&quot; books, this type of story telling is not Grisham's strength.  I found the character development good but the story itself lacked depth and the ending was all too predictable.  A disappointment for all Grisham fans.
B00005QW5X|4.0|I love movies. Especially when they're good. And when I hear from enough people that a film is good, I try to make time for it. <br />I heard from enough people that &quot;Hedwig&quot; was good but I couldn't get all that anxious to see it. I'd seen the preview. It reminded me of &quot;Priscilla,&quot; drag queen on the road, ho-hum. I just assumed I knew what I was going to see.<br />I haven't been so wrong about a movie since I was dragged to see &quot;Election,&quot; all the while complaining, &quot;Who cares about a movie about a high school campaign?&quot; Well, it turned out, I did. And very much. <br />Same situation with this film. From the moment Hedwig lifts her wing-like cape and launches into the first song, I was wide-eyed. <br />John Cameron Mitchell's performance would be amazing even if he hadn't written and directed the movie. Since he did, I'd say that it's one of the most astonishing triple-threat debuts since &quot;Citizen Kane.&quot; Hold on: I'm not saying it's as good as &quot;Citizen Kane,&quot; I'm saying it's somewhere on that list. But that's a good list to be on.<br />I want to also point out a great performance by the actor who played Yitzak, but I fear that saying too much might spoil one of the movies better surprises (whether you caught on from the get-go or near the end, it's still a nice reversal). Yitzak rocks the house.<br />And the songs. They're great. Infectious. Catchy. Clever. &quot;Wig in a Box&quot; is like a letter-perfect transmutation of a classic Billy Joel song and what the film does with it is eye-popping. &quot;Sugar Daddy&quot; &quot;Angry Inch&quot; they're just fantastic.  The whole thing is like a new Ken Russell movie, except it won't make you car sick.<br />Now if only Tenacious D and the Angry Inch could meet in a Bilgewaters somewhere out on the road... two giant forces, equally awesome and pathetic, they could seriously stop the Earth on its axis.
B00005JKOV|5.0|Excellent, thoughful existentialist fare in an outrageous format.  The hapless main character drifts through existence seeking advice and help in answering the BIG questions.  Some of the people he meets seem to be professors of philosophy --I think I recognized Robert Solomon's voice and thoughtfulness.  I found the wavy visual effects annoying and found myself closing my eyes sometimes so I could enjoy the profound and amusing sound track without getting nauseous.  This is the first movie I have recommended to a blind friend.<br />It will be great to get it on DVD where you can enjoy it in bite sized pieces---and presumably get lots of interesting information not available in the movie.

B00000264F|3.0|Actually, I give this record 3 1/2 stars. For those of you who follow my writing, you know that I lean towards heavier stuff like Megadeth and King Diamond. But this record shows that lighter music can have charm too. Despite the moderate intensity of this record, it does have a distinctive edge. I commend this group for not hiding behind excess noise, obscenities, or issues  that wore thin a long time ago. Tracks like 'Stormwind' and 'Wings of Tomorrow' will grab your attention. Tracks like 'Open Your Heart' and 'Dreamer' will show you that sometimes it's the art and not the noise that makes for good music. 'Aphasia' is a good instrumental. Overall, the record has good consistency, a nice edge, and some beauty as well. Would I have taken an hour drive to an expensive 'you name it, we got it' place just for this? Probably not. But if you are able to find it, I do suggest giving it a chance. Is this my favorite record? No. But I will say I think it's A LOT better than a lot of  recent stuff. This may not be my favorite group. But at least they care about the art of music. Also, their music is not just a big commercial racket. Give this record a chance. You won't be sorry.
B00003CXRP|4.0|Since such a desert island scenario involves isolation, the plot thus must by its nature involve such boredom as fishing, scavinging for food, etc.<br />Hanks pulls this off superbly.  I was surprised that this kept my attention.  Was smart enough to realize that the opening scene of the sculpter would be tied into with the FedEx delivery.<br />Wilson was a treat!<br />Ending was well conceived.  Left one's mind to the imagination to fill in the blank.<br />Very enjoyable.
B00003CXXI|5.0|This movie is truly one of those rare jewels that comes along once every ten to twenty years.  It is destined to be a classic that appeals to both young and old.  I laughed and I cried.  My daughter and I enjoy this movie so much, we watch it at least twice everyday (We have owned the video since Thanksgiving 2001).  Moreover, this movie delivers a very strong message.  I am a movie buff, I have seen them all.  For me, this movie stands right up there with the classics.
B00003CXAA|5.0|Cool!!!<BR>Excellent image and sound. Very good extras. There is continuity in the 3 films, impossible not to have them.
B00005JKES|5.0|Please everyone, do not Damn this magnificent set of discs because the pilot is not included.  It was not included in any of the tape sets either!  It was at that time owned by Warner's, and is now owned by Paramount.  Atrisan aparently made every effort to obtain the US rights, but failed.  This information is widely available on websites devoted to the series without number, so there is really no excuse other than laziness or lack of interest not to know the fact.  I used to have the extended play tapes, and going from those with the muddy sound and grainy, smeared picture to a crystal clear picture and sound better than most dvd movie releases is simply fantastic.  How anyone can write a poor review of these discs is simply beyond me.  Whant do you people want?

B00005JKT8|4.0|This movie was very cute. Meg Ryan wonderfully plays the role of Kate, a woman who only has her job to keep her satisfied with life, and Hugh Jackman plays Leopold, a handsome duke from the 19th century who is transported to 2001 by Kate's ex, who lives in the apartment right above Kate's. This movie is heartwarming and funny, but if you focus on the scientific structure of a so-called &quot;fabric in time,&quot; not everything computes with everything else. Undoubtedly a chick flick.
0385505833|5.0|Traditions are oftentimes difficult to break.  One only has to ask Luther and Nora Krank, a middle-class couple in suburban America, who have opted on SKIPPING CHRISTMAS by taking a two week Caribbean cruise aboard the &quot;Island Princess&quot;.  It is an easy choice for Luther, especially since their daughter Blair has enlisted with the Peace Corps for a two-year mission hiatus in Peru.  The tale begins with Blair departing from the airport as the Kranks enter an empty-nest period, resolving that Christmas would not be the same without her.  Seizing the opportunity, Luther leads Nora to break tradition and escape the holiday madness that overshadows the real reason for the season.  It is an idea many have contemplated from time to time without much forethought; however, Luther has made thorough preparations to see the dream come true.  As an accountant, he has estimated that the trip would cost far less than their Christmas expenses from the year before, a whopping $6100, but how far will the Kranks go in SKIPPING CHRISTMAS?<br />This is a well-written gem from the great author, John Grisham, who presents us with a satirical portrait of Americana during the holiday season.  It is a concise and simple read, yet utterly profound at the same time as Grisham subjects the reader to sociological implications for breaking timeless traditions.  For Luther and Nora, they are as simple as hanging a Frosty on your rooftop or giving to certain seasonal charities; nevertheless, Grisham invites us to contemplate these things as we interact with the characters.  Moreover, he adds a spice of holiday magic and good cheer to this realistic view of Christmastime, making it a timeless tale that will be read and (seen?) for years to come, especially during the holiday season.  Although SKIPPING CHRISTMAS is a departure from the author's norm, it is a book that should not be &quot;skipped over&quot; by Grisham fans, for this may be one of his best works, making him more than a one-dimensional author.  Enjoy this little novel and read it as a gift from John Grisham.ne-dimensional author.  Enjoy this little novel and read it as a gift from John Grisham.
B000053GTK|5.0|Gentle Giant was one of the strangest, most interesting, diverse, progressive rock groups of them all. Their 1970-1980 lifetime saw some dozen recordings by them, and the fourth one was &quot;In a Glass House&quot;. One by one, starting in the early 1990s, they began to re-release the originals onto CD, but this one was sadly absent. They finally released &quot;In a Glass House&quot; onto CD late in 2000! This is something of an accomplishment, as the original 1973 LP was not even released in the USA. True to that, this is an import once again! But, it is digitally remastered and sounds great. I was very pleased to replace my bacon sizzling, worn out LP of this Gentle Giant album. The personnel on this CD are: Derek Shulman, vocals, saxophones, and recorder, Gary Green, guitars, mandolin, percussion, Kerry Minnear, keyboards and vocals, Ray Shulman, bass guitars, violin, acoustic guitars, percussion , and vocals, and John Weathers, drums and percussion. All songs are written by Shulman/Shulman/Minnear. What follows is a tracklist and review of each song on the CD.<br />Tracklist/Review.<br />1. &quot;The Runaway&quot;. This one starts us out on the them of &quot;glass house&quot;, as we hear glass breaking. The breaking of glass becomes rhythmic, and a percussive feel is achieved with the glass, until we finally get a kind of explosion of glass and the music begins! Gentle Giant has this way of making changes during a song. After the introduction musically, we change right into singing, Derek Shulman treating us to his own brand of singing. An eclectic singer, he does a fine job in this song. The song pulsates back and forth, loud and soft, instruments change, tempo changes, time changes, suddenly a recorder takes over from the guitar, then a chorus of almost medieval monks chant, and then we come back to the musical theme once again, and then a mad vibes/marimba solo. A very odd tune, but this is the norm for Gentle Giant, and this is one of my favorites on the CD. Here is an example of Lyrics from this song:<br />&quot;He is the runaway, lie low the wanted man,<br />mask his elusive face, soon he will getaway<br />and free is his future no more aimless time<br />to spen, and evading, he's escaping, four<br />dirty walls and a bed in a cage his home no more...&quot;<br />2. &quot;An Inmates Lullaby&quot;. I am not fond of this one, and it is the weakest song on the CD. A pitiful little vocal section on top of a wind up lullaby sound. Weird, but am used to it.<br />3. &quot;Way of Life&quot;. Now, this one is really good. Fast, bouncy, and a lot of fun! It starts with a person yelling &quot;Go!&quot;. Slightly and deliberately offtune, Derek whales this one out. Ray Shulman really jams on the bass in this one. Some great music and musical changes abound in this rocking tune! We jam until we end the song with a kind of medieval recorder feel with a soft organ, and the feeling of resolution is brought about with Kerry Minnear singing his soft vocals.<br />4. &quot;Experience&quot;. The band really proves their tightness as a musical entity in this song. This one starts off mellow, but still fast. Complexity is the rule of this song. It builds nicely, and Kerry Minnear sings at first, then we get to Derek and his whaling vocals: &quot;must have been the &quot;MASTER INNER VOICES! MAKING ANY CHOICES!&quot;. Cool!!<br />5. &quot;Reunion&quot;. The band proves their diversity here with this one. A string quartet now, they accompany Minnear's soft and reminiscing vocals of love long lost and now found.<br />6. &quot;In a Glass House&quot;. My favorite song on the CD, this one really rocks! A fast tempo with complex parts, this one has to be heard to be appreciated, over and over again!<br />Lead violins, acoustic guitars, harpsichords, vocals, electric guitars, heavy basses, all at one time or another. You will also hear mandolins, marimbas, drums, recorders, flutes, trumpets, and saxophones in this song! Truly amazing and talented these guys are.<br />Bonus Tracks.<br />7. The Runaway/Experience Live in Dusseldorf 1976.<br />8. In a Glass House. Live in Munster, 1974.<br />These two bonus tracks are added to the original recording, and really have no place here, as they are of dubious sound quality at best. Listen to the original studio tracks several times before you get to these.<br />All in all, &quot;In A Glass House&quot; is not only one of my favorite Gentle Giant recordings of all, it is one of my all time favorite CD's! A great introduction to those who have never heard Gentle Giant, do go and check this one out!d these guys are. <br />Bonus Tracks. <br />7. The Runaway/Experience Live in Dusseldorf 1976. <BR>8.

B00003CXS4|4.0|The movie is hard to follow because of the little subplots that are going on, not to mention the language. If you are not British it can get a bit confusing. All the characters connect to one another in some way. It is highly entertaining once you understand the gist of where its going. You may need to view it another time. The Brad Pitt character is really funny. I love the way he talks, sometimes I understood him and sometimes I didn't, no matter how many times I listened to him. The aggressive style in which Ritchie directs is fun to watch and the cool dialouge and plot scenarios make it a movie worthwhile to see. It is not as engrossing as Pulp Fiction as this movie has been compared to, by other viewers but still a very fun movie to watch.<br />Lisa Nary
B00005V1Z0|2.0|It is no suprise that this movie is based on a video game. The movie looks like a big video game. Endless, violent unimaginative action sequences with no plot whatsoever. It is hard to care about any character in this movie. You just know this movie was made for 16 year old boys. A lot of action , no plot, but the beatiful Angelina Jolie. If she were not in this movie I would have given this 1 star. She is the one bright spot, though I do not care for the British accent. I hope she got paid a lot of money for this and she does some good with it. I have heard she is a real humanatarian. She obviously worked real hard on getting into good shape for this movie and it is a shame the script did not match her enthusiasm for the part. This movie really bored me. It is possible to make an action filled, intelligent, human movie about archeologists. Check out the Indiana Jones movies. If you think I am some geek who only likes Indie films, think again. I love a good action movie as well as the next guy, but this movie has nothing new to offer. The action scenes are nothing to write home about. Sean Connery's James Bond movies have this movie whipped by a mile and they are over 30 years old!!! ...

B00003CXXJ|1.0|This movie sucked.  I hardly laughed once.  Don't buy it.
B00000JG41|5.0|whateva...  respecting the few reviews i have read, it seems no one has yet to mention the strikingly similar ideas both california and pet sounds (beachboys) share.  This is done deliberately and done very well, though it did take them a good deal of time to `perfect' the sound. for anyone who finds this album of interest, I strongly suggest beachboys petsounds, but as far as the beachboys are concerned that's all im concerned with. i heard california before pet sounds and would have preferred to hear the latter first.  The beginning moments of the CD create the atmosphere were the music centers, though the order of the tracks creates an uncomfortable contrast, but I suppose this is also intentional. With californias concept in mind the album is more focused (as well as fussy at times.  I have faith in their capabilities, but they create like superfluous turtles).   The awry sounds found in the two previous albums are buried in the mix but less bared giving way to a more exceptional/anomalous tone. As for bungles prior pieces they are `one size fits all' bits and don't require an uninterrupted listen to get a full portrait, as does california. i am writing this because some reviewers have mentioned the former albums  as though they were immature so in their defense ill say 'no, its all good'.
B00005JKES|3.0|This is going to sound familiar, but this collection really should have had the pilot included: this mystifying omission is reason for the three-star rating. It was hard to explain to my non-Peaks-aware wife why the narrative began seemingly in the middle of the DVD.<br />Even so, as a Twin Peaks fan, it was great experiencing the episodes again, and I'm not sorry that I purchased this set. The packaging of the set is attractive, the extra features interesting (the Log Lady's original preamble was a very pleasant addition), and the video is clean and pretty.<br />If anything, they've guaranteed a couple of more purchases out of me--one for the pilot, and one for the second season.
0060283122|5.0|The Bad Beginning was the first book in the Baudelaire series. The Baudelaire children, Violet, Klaus, and Sunny, who were skipping rocks at Briny Beach, receive terrible news that their parents died in a terrible fire. Ever since then, the Baudelaires lves have been filled with misery and woe, starting with when they have been sent away to live with their terrible, greedy, and evil uncle, Count Olaf. The children have to do chores every day and cook food for Count Olaf's rude theater troupe, but things only get worse when the Baudelaires realize that Count Olaf is only after the enormous fortune the Baudelaire parents left behind. Klaus, then middle Baudelaire, is the one who figures out that Count Olaf wants to marry Klaus's older sister Violet literally in a play called The Marvelous Marriage in order to gain control of the Baudelaires fortune, and things get even worse when sunnt is hung from the top of a tower in a cage until Violet agrees to marry Count Olaf. You'll have to buy and read the book for yourself to see how the Baudelaires escaped from their miserable situation.
B00005Q66T|5.0|When you listen to \\"GHV2\\" the only question going through your head is how in the hell can one artist have so many amazing songs?  People have said this before but it's because it is true...EVERY POP MUSIC FAN NEEDS THIS RECORD.  All the songs on this album are amazing.  From \\"Erotica\\" to \\"Ray Of Light\\" to \\"Frozen\\" this album is NEVER boring.  None of the songs sound the same like a lot of artists out now do.  The songs all have there own style and because of that are a blast to listen to.  \\"Deeper and Deeper\\" will instantly become one of your favorite Madonna songs if you are not familiar with it yet.  So I say BUY THIS RECORD.  IT IS WORTH THE BIG [amt]!
B000031XCR|3.0|As this album is to be considered a sort of a ,,best of&quot; , I think it would have been only fair to include songs as ,,Call The Man&quot;(which is one of the best she's ever had), ,,Treat Her Like A Lady&quot; or ,,Falling into you &quot;. Anyway, it's a good album, that's worth listening, especially her ,,That's the way it is&quot; song which is very optimistic :)
B00005QZWJ|5.0|This OST is fabulous, it's one of the best OSTs I've ever come across. I just love the exceptional use of music during the film and Enya's touch in this album is great. I personally love &quot;Concerning Hobbits&quot; the best, it has a great country rural feel to it, creating a comfortable atmosphere. But I just love this CD, it is a must buy and you should see the movie first ofcourse! The songs really depict the scenes they represent and is a must for your CD collection!
B00004Z459|5.0|This cd is the best cd i have ever bought! Linkin Park is the greatest band ever, to say the least, and if you like rock or rap or good music in general, then you need to pick up this album. You can't even put a label on what type of music Linkin Park plays, they are so good. And they are NOT a band just thrown together to make money by some record company, and they are NOT sellouts, either...every single song on the album is the best ive heard in a while, and if it was possible to give a 100 out of 5, i would. Chester Bennington has the most amazing voice, and Mike Shinoda is just awesome, and Brad Delson is a great guitarist. Not to say Joe Hahn (dj), Phoenix (bassist), and Rob Bourdon (drummer) are not awesomely great as well; because they are! I am looking foward to their next album, and strongly recommend their debut, and the DVD (frat party at the pancake festival) for serious LP fans.<br />I also recommend:<br />Taproot, Gift<br />Staind, Dysfunction, Break the Cycle<br />Deftones, all of them<br />Tool, all of them<br />Adema, Adema
B00005N9CV|5.0|Canadian girl Diana Krall is at her best on this recording.  I have to say I haven't liked some of her earlier work.  In fact, last night I started to watch her on TV, performing with her combo in Paris.  After ten minutes or so, I turned it off and put on \\"The Look of Love\\" CD.<br />That's when it hit me why this CD was such a clever career move:  She's already conquered the jazz market (witness all the reviewers who detest this disk but admit they have all her OTHER recordings), and now she's aiming to win over those of us who are not jazz fans.<br />And a lot of us hate jazz, with everyone frantically playing random notes in quick succession, with the only aim apparently being to play every note in the key EXCEPT those of the melody.<br />This new recording puts all that aside and concentrates on her gorgeously sensuous voice.  Her sultry crooning, interwoven with the lush orchestrations (the fadeout of \\"Dancing In The Dark\\" is gorgeous) makes most other \\"seduction music\\" sound coarse and vulgar.<br />I noticed the criticism of her Spanish diction in \\"Besame Mucho\\" in an earlier review, which pointed to a Brazilian as a standard to be strived for.  Since when is a Portuguese speaker a better example of how Spanish should be pronounced?<br />And to all those who obsess about her dress and shoes, I say:  \\"Just close your eyes and listen!\\"
0446677450|3.0|This book is effective in getting you to rethink your path to wealth.  However, it is redundant in stating it's thesis:  assets vs. liabilities.  Some of the incidents from the author's youth did not ring true.  Also,  there was a lack of information that could be put to practical use.  A good book for young people to help them direct their future.
B00000IUT7|5.0|I forgot to mention that you need a long thin phillips screwdriver to put the batteries in it since they go under the smokestack, which is something I couldn't find right away &amp; could be a problem if you've got kids jumping up &amp; down wanting to play.
B00004XOWM|1.0|yeah, even the band itself cant take it. its sad that this what the music industry has come to. and freddy has the nerve to talk bad about nine inch nails? at least if youre gonna TRY and insult a band a million times better and more original than you, WRITE YOUR OWN LYRICS. oh wait, you cant. oh well, just keep &quot;rollin' rollin' rollin'&quot;.....
B00000IUT7|5.0|I got this train for my 8 yr old. It was originally a xmas present but came too late. Her initial reaction was &quot;Is this all?&quot;, but after they started playing with it-they played for hours! It does suck the battery juice but it can be run on auto as well. It also doesn't corner well,it gets hung up. but we have not had any problems with it not climbing hills &amp; have even gotten it to pull up to 8 cars.For the money,I thought it was well worth it.
B00004T9AS|5.0|For those of you who are expecting QE2 or something from MO's earliest style, you'd be really surprised at how wonderful this album is... I've had it for years and it really has become one of my favorites...very spiritual...musically so beautifully composed and performed...Have been listening to Mike Oldfield for 20 years, no one can tell me this album isn't one of his best!!!
B00003CX5P|1.0|Well Star Trek V used to be listed as my number one worst movie of all time, but this one edged it out. I loved the others and was so disappointed at this movie which is basically a 2 hour toy advertisment.  I heard Lucas's defense of the quality of the movie was that the movie is &quot;for kids&quot;.  Kid are not stupid George.  Also nice rip off of the virgin birth story, geeze can you get less orignial?
B000005RT8|3.0|Paul had begun this album in 1979, to get some solo tracks down. The album was released in summer 1980, after Paul's infamous Japan pot bust in January of that year. This finds Paul experimenting with synthesizer sounds. Not unheard of in 1980, and certainly not Paul's last venture into this realm. You only need to hear parts of Tug of War (1982), Pipes of Peace (1983), Give My Regards To Broad Street (1984), or Press To Play (1986) to hear some tracks with synths. I haven't forgotten about Flowers In The Dirt (1989) either, but it seemed by then Paul might have been trying to move back toward rock and away from the &quot;synth 80's&quot; sound. Track by track,here goes. For those playing at home, I am listening to the 1987 cd release with no bonus tracks.<br />Coming Up- The live version of this was a hit in the US. In the UK, this studio version was the hit. Bass thumping, synthesizer horns going, and echo (with higher pitched vocals by Paul and Linda) vocals abound. Paul enters the 1980's with a track either fans love or hate. I do like this one for it's novelty value. This is like &quot;what was Paul doing in 1980?&quot;. Catchy pop tune about a brighter future. The live version is better and can be found on the US All The Best (1987) or Wingspan (2001). The tone of the brighter future is ironic given what was to follow on December 8, 1980.....<br />Temporary Secretary- If there is ever a McCartney track that should be erased, this should be it. The synth beginning with acoustic guitar is ok for about 30 seconds. Then come some ok vocals, but the chorus is horrible. About 0:52 into the song it become grating on the nerves. Yuck! Shoulda been shelved. This proves what Paul can do if left on his own with absolutely no one to tell him what he is doing wrong.<br />On The Way- The count in seems to be a take on Lennon's Yer Blues from 1968. Listen to both count ins back to back, and you may see what I mean. An echo vocal, but kinda cool blues number. Without the echo vocal, this would have sounded less dated. The track still seems to hold up after time, when you get past the echo.<br />Waterfalls- Ah, beautiful. Perhaps one of Paul's best ballads, up to 1980, since Yesterday. Very similar in structure. A modern day Yesterday with synths. Talking about what happens about being more careful about taking risks in life. Perhaps a metaphor to stop with the drugs and be around for his family? He sings of needing love, and perhaps holding those closest to you, even closer. Again, even more appropriate given what was to happen in December 1980......<br />Nobody Knows- Electro funk hoedown (there, betcha never would see that in a review). Kinds bluesy, very like track 3 (On The Way). Vocals sound like Bo Diddley, or BB King, with a severe echo effect. Good, catchy, if you listen to the lyrics.<br />Front Parlour- The man wrote video game music too? Sounds like my old nintendo system circa 1987. Could be missing music to Mario Brothers video games? Kinda cool in it's own fluff way. Nothing deep. More of another curiosity, than anything. Again, screams B side more than anything.<br />Summer's Day Song- Synth instrumental song. Nice vocals. Song about dawn. At least, that's what comes to my head. Listen to it and you will know what I mean. Mostly intrumental, with some vocals in the beginning.<br />Frozen Jap- Renamed Frozen japaneese when the lp was issued in Japan, so not to upset his Japaneese fans. More video game music, set to a &quot;Japaneese&quot; disco synth type of theme.<br />Bogey Music- Funny, somewhat entertaining track. Elvis with a big echo. Really, without the echo, this track would have been better. Kind of a weird synth tribute to Elvis. A 50's rock backbeat set to real early 80's synths.<br />Darkroom- Funky little number. Bass heavy. Almost like early rap? Don't know, but macca wants to take you to his dark room. :)<br />One of Those Days- Really a good song. Not dated. Simple acoustic song. Relfecting on clearing up his head. Perhaps he also means about preserving the environment when he sings of fresh air?<br />Check My Machine- More sound experiments begin with cartoon excerpts. Really high vocal, and synths. Funky, I like it. However, I can see where not everyone would. This was originally a B-side to a single before being added to the 1987 cd release.<br />Secret Friend- Vocals repeated over and over again for 10 minutes. This was done in 1970 on the Beatles (though that didn't last 10 minutes, but more like around 3-4 minutes), and would be done again on Driving Rain (to much better rocking effect) in 2001. Congas, maracas, synths and bass inter play.<br />Over all, not a horrible album. Certainly one of a few of Paul's weak albums. This can count as his weakest as he has many undeveloped songs. If this were a bootleg, it might be brilliant. But, we came to expect more of Paul before; and he would deliver better in the future. Get any other McCartney album first before this one. This one is for hard core McCartney fans. After John's tragic murder, the masterpiece Tug of War (1982) would result.his head.

B00005R2BG|5.0|I rented this movie because honestly, nothing else was in.  I am not a big fan of nicole kidman... but i am glad i put that aside to rent it.  This is by far the best movie i have seen in years.  it is the best movie i have ever seen.  nicole kidman actually was very good in this movie.  her singing isn't bad... but the shining star in this movie is ewan mcgregor.  i have always liked him but after seeing this movie, i adore him.  his singing is amazing.  i was in awe of his &quot;your song&quot;, dare i say better than elton?  the music in this movie is outstanding.  this movie is outstanding.  I recommend this movie for anyone.  I am going to go watch again... enjoy.
B0000584TJ|4.0|Khan only released this one album, Space Shanty in 1972. If you like Gong or Hatfield &amp; the North, you know you need this album thanks to the presence of Steve Hillage and Dave Stewart. But unlike those bands, Khan has a very typical prog rock sound, heavy on the Hammond organ (the electric piano that Dave Stewart would later use much more like with Hatfield &amp; the North is kept to a minimum here concentrating mostly on the organ). The music is also definately heavier than what Caravan had done as well, none of the pop tendencies like you would hear from that band. Some of the passages are jazzy, but not in the fusion style like Hatfield &amp; the North. At this point, Steve Hillage hadn't really developed his trademark guitar style (although the opening cut does features a fantastic guitar solo that will represent his trademark style like on Gong's You and his solo efforts, most of the rest of the album sounds like him sounding like any other countless guitarists in prog and jazz rock bands). You don't even have to like Gong or Hatfield &amp; the North to like Space Shanty, you just have to like early '70s Hammond organ driven prog rock. My only real complaint of the album is it gets rather homogenous in the long run, despite the rather interesting compositions.
B00000JL86|3.0|Don Bluth is an incredibly gifted artist.  His character designs and animation can be breathtaking.  Unfortunately, he and frequent collaborator Gary Goldman can't tell a cohesive story to save their lives.  Of all of his films I've seen, &quot;Anastasia&quot; is by far their best.  Whether this is because of solid source material (although that didn't stop &quot;The Secret of NIMH&quot; from falling to pieces story-wise) or the incredible score by Lynn Aherns and Stephen Flaherty, &quot;Anastasia&quot; remains in my estimation Bluth and Goldman's most watchable movie.<br />Based loosely on a play by Marcelle Maurette and Guy Bolton. As well as the 1956 film adaptation of the play by Arthur Laurents, the story turns the mystery of the disappearance of Anastasia, daughter of Czar Nicholas, following the murder of the Russian royal family, into a fairy tale.  You have to ignore everything you know about history in order to accept the execution of the film--it plays loose with the Communist revolution and with Rasputin.<br />Dimitri (voiced with great charm by John Cusack, sung by John Dokuchitz) is a con artist living in St. Petersburg.  Along with his friend Vladimir (the entertaining Kelsey Grammer), he is searching for a young girl who can play the role of the missing Romanoff heir in order to claim a reward from the dowager empress who has escaped to Paris.  He meets Anya (voiced with much character by Meg Ryan, sung by the incredible Liz Callaway) and immediately sees in her the girl to carry out his plans.  As he and Vladimir work with Anya to perfect her ruse, he comes to realize that she is the true Anastasia.<br />Then we add the elements that make it a Don Bluth movie--Anya has a cute dog and there is a magical villain in the (dead) body of Rasputin (played gleefully over the top by Christopher Lloyd and sung by Jim Cummings).  And, of course, Rasputin has his cute animal sidekick in the form of an albino bat, Bartok (the always effective Hank Azaria).  Rasputin wants revenge on the Romanoffs for his undead state and sets off to kill the princess.  It should also be noted that Bernadette Peters and Angele Lansbury round out the voice cast in entertaining performances.<br />Okay, if you can put aside your feelings of misgivings regarding the animal sidekicks and revisionist history, there is much that is entertaining in this film.  The score by Broadway veterans Aherns and Flaherty is probably one of the best ever composed for an animated movie.  The script does provide action, adventure, romance, and comedy.  It's probably the most human script directed by Bluth and Goldman.  There is some spectacular animation, the runaway train scene stands out as truly effective.<br />There are drawbacks.  It is trying too hard to out-Disney Disney, from the opening number to the very structure of the story.  The computer animation isn't always well integrated.  The music box never looks like it exists in the same reality as the animated characters and the afore-mentioned train sequence is obviously not cell animation.  But these drawback are relatively minor compared to the overblown climax of the movie.  Still, flaws aside, it does entertain.  I have watched it several times and have definitely gotten my money's worth of this DVD.<br />The DVD ovvers you the option of fullscreen and letterbox presentation, a short featurette about the making of the movie, and a pair of sing-along sequences.<br />All in all, I recommend this movie to people who enjoy animated musicals.  If you like this, you may also like Disney's &quot;Beauty and the Beast&quot; and &quot;Hunchback of Notre Dame&quot;, &quot;My Neighbor Totoro&quot;, Frank Oz's musical version of &quot;Little Shop of Horrors&quot;, &quot;The Iron Giant&quot;, &quot;James and the Giant Peach&quot;, and &quot;The Nightmare before Christmas&quot;.<br />(C)2001 Joe Edkin
B00002599I|5.0|By 1990, Black Sabbath were virtually gone from the metal landscape. Ask any of the wise-ass metalheads of the era, and thats what they'll tell you. Music, as far as they've always been concerned, was not actually about music, but image and who is playing it. Most hard rock/metal bands have had ever-changing lineups. Which, to these people, is ok as long as the music gets played on the radio, etc. Ask how they feel about lineups and 9  out of 10 times they will claim that the &quot;original&quot; lineup was and is and  always will be the best and the rest is just garbage. Tell them that 'Smoke On The Water' wasn't in fact original Deep Purple and watch their faces go numb (if they believe you at all). Get it? It's not the music, it's the general acceptance and knowledge of who's playing it that makes the fools listen. Thats no way to listen to music and I think most real music fans know that already. There's nothing I can say about &quot;Tyr&quot; that hasn't already been said here; it may well be the greatest Black Sabbath album ever made though. Oh yeah, Ozzy's not singing, the replacement Tony Martin is. And who do you think has the far better voice? Well, Martin does, but he's lacking the image. At least he didn't abuse animals or his wife to earn one. He lets the music speak for itself.
B00000JMQE|3.0|This movie is a visual treat, but be warned--it is not a spiritual sequel to the classic MGM version of &quot;The Wizard of Oz.&quot;  This movie is much more in keeping with the tone of L. Frank Baum's original novels than the beloved Judy Garland movie and may be too disturbing for young children.<br />The story takes place after the twister devastated the Gale house.  Dorothy (Fairuza Balk) is depressed, and no one wants to believe her stories about her trip to Oz.  Finally, in hopes of curing her of her delusions, Auntie Em (Piper Laurie) takes Dorothy to see a psychiatrist in the big city.  The psychiatrist convinces Auntie Em that all Dorothy needs is a bit of shock treatment to make her better.<br />Auntie Em leaves Dorothy in the Doctor's care, but before he can give her the treatment, a fierce electrical storm cuts off power to the hospital.  Dorothy escapes with the help of a mysterious girl, and gets swept down a raging river.  She winds up back in Oz where she if befriended by a talking hen, Jack Pumpkinhead, and the robotic Tick Tock.  Oz has fallen on bad times, overrun by the Gnome King (Nicol Williamson, happily chewing the scenery) and his ally, the evil Princess Moombi (Jean Marsh, who gives a fun performance).  It is up to Dorothy and her friends to restore Oz to what once it was.<br />The real stars of this movie are the design and the puppetry.  The movie is a visual feast.  However, it is also slow going.  I can't imagine kids sitting through it easily.  It's hard enough for adults.  The pacing is awkward and Fairuza Balk (in her screen debut) doesn't have the charaisma to be sufficiently entertaining to keep the viewer's interest in the slow parts.<br />It's hard to strongly recommend this movie to casual viewers, but those who enjoy beautiful set design, effective camera work, excellent special effects, and superb animation may be sufficiently entertained.<br />The DVD allows you to choose between letterbox and fullscreen presentation.  It also includes an introduction by Fairuza Balk (she doesn't have anything terribly interesting to say, unfortunately) and an interview featurette.  I suspect that people who enjoy the movie for its technical achievements will be disappointed by the featurette, especially if they are seeking more insight into the work that went into making the movie.<br />If you enjoy this movie, you may also like &quot;James and the Giant Peach&quot;, &quot;The Iron Giant&quot;, &quot;The Nightmare before Christmas&quot;, and &quot;The Wizard of Speed and Time&quot;.<br />(C)2001 Joe Edkin
B00005JKES|2.0|What a mistake. This DVD set doesn't include the pilot. You are left with a brief synopsis of what happened in the pilot at the beginning of the first episode. Terrible, terrible, terrible! I guess I'll need to buy the separate pilot DVD.... Oh wait, its not available. Shoot me.
B00005N9CV|5.0|I am not much of a jazz buff, but after hearing &quot;Dancing in the dark&quot; (on the radio), I fell in love with her.<br />&quot;The Look of Love&quot; has everything I think I would like to hear in more Jazz music... that is, the music I do know.<br />With her stunning face and unforgettable body/eyes, I thought she was the famous actress Peta Wilson, better known as Nikita.<br />&quot;Cry me a river&quot; is divine as well as &quot;Dancing in the dark&quot;. I call those two songs mood songs, because they are so dramatic, yet so romantic at the same time. &quot;Besame Mucho&quot; is a song I only knew about when I heard Dalida sing it in the late 70's, I think.<br />Just look at the song titles and you'll want to buy the cd right away. Like I said...I never liked jazz too much, and I had heard of Diana Krall, but I never actually heard her sing before buying getting this recording. Not only would I like to get all her other cds, but I would love to see her perform live someday. I must say that because of the songs &quot;Cry me a river&quot; and &quot;Dancing in the dark&quot;, I will always like this wonderful artists music.<br />Inside the booklet, there are the soulful-eyed photos of Diana. I like the idea of coming right out with the names of the performers for each track, rather than lining the booklet with a long and clumsy book of lyrics. What I mean is that the packaging is quite simple, and it leaves more attention for the music itself.<br />Do you want to know the tracklist?<br />1-S'Wonderful  2-Love Letters  3-I Remember You  4-Cry Me a River 5-Besame Mucho  6-The Night We Called it a Day  7-Dancing in the Dark  8-I Get Along Without You Very Well  9-The look of Love  10-Maybe You'll Be There<br />The tracklist is short and sweet, but the tracks are gorgeous and well sung. What else can I say?<br />I am happy with this CD and I hope you will be too, when you buy it. Enjoy.
B00004TJK2|5.0|I write this review after just learning that Jacques, the main subject of the movie, the first man to dive below 330', has died.  I loved this picture when I first saw it in theaters, and always felt the ending actually gave the same impression as what one finds in the European version.  Yes, the music and the cinematography are great, but what I enjoyed most about the movie was identifying with the idealism of Jacques' character.  Enzo, his rival, pursues the sport of free diving, the only sport with actual limits to achievement, for the purposes of the competition.  Jacques does it for the romance, and love of the ocean depths.  The director, actors, and filmers of this movie bring this all out beautifully- a sport where one can truly become one with the ocean, returning back to our mother, brought into it's truest fruition by Jacques.  Rest in Peace, Jacques.
B00003CX5P|1.0|I would rather have fungus grow on me rather than this movie. I can't believe this is the first chapter in the great Star Wars trilogy. The first one we're supposed to watch. It actually would have been good if they cut Jar Jar down and maybe had him speak in a foreign language, like when the Jedi first enter Otoh Gunga, it pans to a Gungan saying something in Gunganese or whatever. IT was aweful to hear, \\"Exsqueeze me\\" and \\"How wude\\" and \\"Mesa luv you\\". The Anakin character was corny and bascially cheesier than anything I've seen before. \\"This is intense\\" and \\"Now this is podracing\\" as he \\"maneuvers\\" into the control ship and accidentally blows it up. Man, the other pilots [stink]. I felt like I was in a bad slapstick movie for kids, with Jar Jar stepping in crap and having an animal fart in his face, and with all the Bugs Bunny sound effects. I can't believe this actaully made it out. Couldn't anyone tell Lucas that it made you feel dumbed down. I think, actually I know that if he fixed those weak points and actually made it stronger and a stand alone film, it really would be at the top, first, where it should be.
B00005JKMO|5.0|As a youth who experienced the dynamics of the 70's, this movie depicts the rage and honest desire for change in a society that was motivated by racial prejudice.  Ali hit the opponent, the past; and kicked a world into the future...
B00003CXTF|1.0|The actors don't seem to know they're living in 1941.  Ben Affleck just mouths his lines.  The only time I cared about any of the people in the film was the anonymous sailors and nurses who died in the attack.   What a hackneyed plot.  They wrote better &quot;B&quot; picture scripts in the 40's.  Where's Artie Shaw?<BR>Where's jive talk?  Where's the radio shows?  Parts of the attack are quite emotionally moving without being too manipulative which is the only reason I gave it 1 star.  If you're interested in the Doolittle Raid get &quot;Thirty Seconds Over Tokyo&quot; which has excellent SFX for its time and is a true story with first rate  actors and direction. Ignore the first half of the movie's bad plot - coming back from the dead, how many times have we seen that one on daytime television?  The middle 30 minutes are okay and at some points even spectacular, but Pearl Harbor should not be about &quot;Entertainment&quot; with a CAPITAL &quot;E&quot; and that's what all the pyrotecnics are there for it seems, just to entertain.  Disgusting.
B00005JKES|5.0|This is a great box set, and I can't wait for the second season to come out on DVD as well.<br />For those of you confused as to why the pilot isn't included on the set; apparently, Warner Brothers (who owns the rights to the pilot, not the series) was unwilling to release it to Artisan for the set, so they had to go with what they had. Luckily, the rights have now reverted back to Paramount, which has a much stronger history of DVD releases. I urge you, if you want the pilot on DVD, to e-mail the good people over at Paramount and express your interest...Twin Peaks forever!
0805062971|4.0|This book is a great, easy read, especially if you have seen the movie.  I really can't judge what it would be like coming in clean, with no knowledge of the movie, and so as I read the book I imagined the entire narrative in Edward Norton's dry, deadpan voice.  If you were a fan of the movie it's very fascinating to see the differences in Palahniuk's original vision and the final product of he movie.  Plotwise, I think the movie is smoother and more streamlined.  There are minor differences (the use of Jack vs. Joe), and major differenes (the ending).  What especially surprised me was how true to the book Fincher stayed in some instances, and its pretty cool to see how Palahniuk's writing style (throwing out random tidbits of information, using single sentence paragraphs) adapts so well to film.  I don't want to give anymore away, as part of the fun is comparing the book with the movie.  Enjoy this book and don't take it too lightly!
B00005R2M3|5.0|I was really wary of buying this album.  First of all, I'd only heard one single, and it took me a few listens to like it.  Secondly, I didn't know much about Shakira and I got the initial impression that she was an overproduced, cookie-cutter pop star with an aversion to any significant amount of clothing.  After purchasing her CD, I am very, very impressed.  Not only does Shakira have a beautiful, strong voice and a wide vocal range, I was also surprised to find out that she writes all her own music and produced the CD.  She is a very talented songwriter.  It's so refreshing to see the emergence of more strong female artists with an ability to write a song that is both sensual and respectable.  When Shakira writes about love or sex, she does so as if she's talking to her soulmate, the only one in the world for her, not some guy she picked up at a party.  With her lyrics, melodies, and her vocal talent she reminds me of a mix between Jewel and Natalie Merchant with a Latin twist (plus a certain something extra and original of her own).  From what I've seen so far, Shakira is nothing like my initial impression suggested, although in her &quot;Whenever, Wherever&quot; video, I did think it would have been more believable if she were wearing a sweater in the mountain scene rather than a halter top.  :)
B00003CXDD|5.0|What do you get when you have George Lucas AND Ron Howard, both famous for their work in the movie-making industry, producing and directing this movie? You've got it, a fantastic, rollicking fantasy-adventure!<br />The evil Queen Bavmorda (Jean Marsh) has for years been searching for the baby who, according to an ancient prophecy, will end her reign of terror. Taking all the pregnant women, she searches each and every baby when one day, the sacred girl is born. But before Bavmorda could kill her, a faithful midwife takes the child away from the castle. When she realizes she is being pursued, she lets the baby drift away on a river. The abandoned girl is found by a Nelwyn named Willow Ufgood (Warwick Davis). But Willow quickly finds out that the baby is being tracked down Bavmorda's armies, including her daughter Sorsha (Joanne Whalley) and General Kael (Pat Roach). Willow sets out to the crossroads to give the baby back to the Daikini, or the big humans. He finds out though through the magical Cherlindrea (Maria Holvoe) about the baby, Elora Danan (played by both Ruth and Kate Greenfield) and the prophecy about her. Willow, with the companionship of swordsman and warrior Madmartigan (Val Kilmer) and Brownies Rool and Franjean (Kevin Pollak &amp; Rick Overton), they go to seek help from sorceress Fin Raziel (Patricia Hayes). <br />A totally charming movie, &quot;Willow&quot; will be one of my favorite movies to watch for a long time. Though people must be warned that though it is rated PG, it's more like PG-13 in some areas and I strongly suggest that adults watch before their children do. <br />Everything is wonderful about the movie, from the directing, the acting by the whole cast, an enchanting plot, pretty good special effects, and plenty of humor and action. There's humor that is witty, sarcastic, and laugh-out-loud funny. Val Kilmer as Madmartigan and the two Brownies gets plenty of great lines. Yet at the same time the movie is pretty serious with all of thebattles against good and evil, and Val Kilmer is a great swash-buckling swordfighter and handles the sword pretty well.<br />And this DVD isn't called &quot;Special Edition&quot; for no reason. Though it may not have as many special features as many recent movie special editions, &quot;Willow&quot; will satisfy you. 1) Commentary by Warwick Davis, 2) Willow: Making of an Adventure Featurette, 3) Featurette: Morf to Morphing, 4) Behind-the-Scenes Still Gallery, 5) Theatrical Teasers and Trailers, 6) 8 TV Spots, and a few more. One thing you must watch is the 'Making of an Adventure Featurette'. Looking at an older Ron Howard with his mustache certainly was a little shock to me after seeing him play Opie on the &quot;Andy Griffith Show&quot; and acting in &quot;Happy Days&quot;. One part that was fun about it is when they were talking about the love scenes in the movie. Val Kilmer admits that whenever he had to kiss Joanne Whalley, afterwards he always forgot his lines and no matter how many times they had to do it, he never got it right. They were married after making the movie but unfortunately, they were divorced later on.<br />So if you are thinking about getting &quot;Willow&quot;, I strongly recommend that you watch it! Enjoyable for the whole family, if your children are old enough to handle some parts of the film. And if you have a chance to check out the quotes and trivia page on Amazon, I suggest you do because you can find out all sorts of things.
B00005OM4N|2.0|Although I'm more than a little disappointed in how Britney has allowed herself to be marketed to her potential and existing audience, I have always made it a rule to try to separate the singer from the music.  I have thought that many of Britney Spears' songs are catchy and listenable in the past, but I've never bought one of her CDs until now.  Granted, I bought it with a gift certificate and probably wouldn't have otherwise.  But nonetheless, I wanted to give her music a chance.  I have to say that I'm regretting the purchase.  I can overlook a few mild sexual undertones in a couple songs and I can even get past (with some effort) the scanty video wardrobe she seems to favor of late.  But there are a couple of things I can't overlook on this new CD.  There are two songs in particular (Slave and Boys) which are particularly offensive, even to an adult.  (I can only imagine what the parents of Britney Spears' younger audience members are thinking.  For that matter, what do her parents think?  My dad would flip out if he ever saw me fondling a snake on MTV!)  &quot;I'm A Slave 4 U&quot; asks &quot;Don't you want to dance up on me?&quot;.  Arguably innocent on its own, but couple that with a hushed line that (if it doesn't actually say it) is a fantastic simulation of Britney saying &quot;I want to have sex with you&quot;.  &quot;Boys&quot; goes on all about how Britney wants to &quot;get freaky&quot;.  Something tells me she's not talking about buying a cool Halloween costume.  Couple these things with weak vocals (have any of you ever heard Britney Spears sing live?), flat melodies, and a wimpy 40 minutes of &quot;music&quot; and I think that two stars is more than generous.  I'm quite disappointed because based on her early releases, I thought Britney could have been a great role model for younger girls and someone people wanted to listen to for more than the free poster of her in a half shirt and lowrider jeans.  But maybe money can buy happiness after all, rightBritney?
0553579908|4.0|Upon reading the first book in this series (A Game of Thrones), I ran around for weeks, telling everyone that would listen that it was the best book I have ever read. So it was with a weird mix of anticipation and dread that I started A Clash of Kings. What if it wasn't as good? <br /> Well, it was as good. The only reason I'm not giving it a 5 is because by the end of the book, I was starting to have a little trouble keeping all of the various characters, their machinations, the wars, betrayals, alliances, etc., straight. This is a REALLY dense, busy book; you have to pay attention when you read it.<br /> After the shocking murder that threw the Seven Kingdoms into turmoil in Book One, the various Kingdoms are at war; No less than 5 different men are claiming the mantle of King.......<BR> Joffrey Baratheon- son of the late King Robert....or IS he?<BR> Renly Baratheon- Robert's younger brother. A great talker, but can he lead an Army?<BR> Stannis Baratheon- Robert's older brother. He's lived in Robert's shadow for over a decade (Hating him all that time), and now he's ready to claim what he feels should have been his all along....by any means necessary.<BR> Robb Stark- A 16 year old who has had the mantle of leadership thrust upon him, he fights more for revenge upon the people who tore apart his family than for power.<BR> Balon Greyjoy- Father of Theon Greyjoy, Ward of Eddard Stark. While the other 4 armies fight in the open, he will sneak in and try to get revenge on his dead enemy.<BR> Meanwhile, Danaerys Targaryen, the rightful heir to the Iron Throne, struggles to raise an army, and reclaim her birthright. (Did I mention she's only 14 years old?)<BR> And beyond the wall in the North, Mance Rayder is rallying an army of Wildlings, Wargs, Mammoths, Giants, and God-knows-what-else, in a bid to break through the wall, and take the Seven Kingdoms as his own.<br /> And that's just the Cliffs Notes version.....There's intrigue, incest, sorcery, cannibalism, the walking dead, fratricide, rapes, murders, looting & pillaging...whew!<br /> Martin, as in the last book, earns a ton of admiration for being able to juggle dozens of stories, told from 10 or 12 different perspectives, without confusing the reader (too much, at least!). After reading the first Two books back-to-back, I decided to read someting else before plunging into Book Three. Perhaps the truest compliment I can Give Mr. Martin is this: In the 4 days since I finished A Clash of Kings, I think of Arya, Sansa, Robb, Rickon, Bran, Jon, and the Wolves quite a bit. I can't wait to see what happens to them next, and fervently hope that they all make it through to the conclusion of the series alive.<br /> Bravo, Mr. Martin!<br /> Now on to A Storm of Swords!
B00003CXTG|1.0|Totally Inaccurate Blatantly using ships that were not even built until the 1960's and 1970's as part of the battle scene totally ruined the movie for me. I was TAD on the Hewitt, which was used in the battle scenes. You would think with all the computer animation they would have covered up the historical inaccuracies.
B00003CXXS|3.0|Was this a Gilligan's Island episode with really good special effects? I think so. The films plot can be summed up as follows: Boy is stuck on island for EIGHT weeks and SURVIVES, while a group of adults lead by a PALEONTOLOGIST can barelly make it out of the dinosaur infested island and they're only there for a little over twenty four hours. Give me a break.<br />Sam Neill (who did a great performance in JP), William H. Macy, and Tea Leoni, whom are all &quot;A&quot; list stars don't deliver a convincing performance, partly because they filmed JP3 without a FINISHED script!<br />Now there are a lot of ways you can look at this movie, and I choose to look at it as an action flick and nothing more. The SFX were good, except for some scenes with the animatronic Spinosaurus, and the pteranodons were great. But the film is very dissapointing compared to its predecessors.<br />While the raptors got smarter, the plot got dumber. If the raptors were so smart, they wouldn't have signed on for this sorry sequel.
B00003CXXS|4.0|this movie was absolutely good. it was a little to short but nevertheless exciting with the best storyline of the series probably. You need this dvd now especially if your into dinosaurs. The dinosaurs were superb for this film and quite possibly the best of the series when it comes to cgi effects. You need this dvd seriously. I hope you all enjoy the brand new dinosaur they have loaded for this film.
B00003W8NM|5.0|Fight Club has to be recognized as possibly the best psychological thriller of all time. This film cannot be compared to any other. It's impossible to get into many details without spoiling the plot, but if your looking for a fresh, energetic and thought provoking film..this is it. David Fincher has a history of great films, but nothing of this caliber. Fight Club can look forward to decades of cult status. Do you know who rocks even more...
B00004Z4WR|2.0|I've written some longer reviews lately and i'm tired. so i shall be brief in my attempt to summarize gone in sixty seconds the new one with Cage. It's stupid slow with no true high octane chase scenes like the original. it seems to only bare its resemblance to the original in general idea and name. it's not very good. Jolie is barely in the movie Ribisi and Duvall's talents are as expected wasted. Nice cars but with no real plot to help distinguish itself and not any really good acting it falls short of even just three stars. thank you and have a good day or night whichever it is.
B00005NWM3|4.0|If there's one thing I can't stand is reviewers saying that Nickelback is a one hit wonder, or a new band.  They've been around for quite some time folks, and had a few hits from their release &quot;The State&quot; in Breathe and Leader of Men.  While we're all sick and tired of How You Remind Me by now, this cd offers a nice amount of variety to keep an intriguing listen the whole way through.  Some of the latter songs lack a strong beat or direction, but great songs like Never Again, Woke Up This Morning and the new single Too Bad more than make up for it.  While I can't say this CD is the best new rock this year, it definitely rises above most of the rap and nu-metal mumbo jumbo that seems to have afflicted MTV and the radio.  Buy this CD for a breath of fresh air.
B000059HAI|5.0|rent this movie instead of pearl harbor. pearl harbor starring Ben Affleck and Josh Hartnett is terribley made. Get this version of the Dec. 7 attack and quick. This one actually manages to devote the whole movie to peral harbor and they do it spectacularly. The attack is well-done and superbly choreographed it should be ranked up there with other great war movies like Gettysburg,Midway, and even the longest day.
B00001ZWBQ|5.0|If you are even remotely a fan of the Bee Gees you will love this DVD!  In fact, any music lover would love it!  After decades of unbelievable magic these boys still have it and don't seem to be giving it up any time soon!<BR>Buy it for your wife, girlfriend, whoever...she will love it and<BR>it will bring out the romance in both of you!<BR>PS as for the reviewer who commented on Barry Gibb straining and struggling with the singing, why doesn't he/she try to keep up this kind of career for decades!!  Give the guy a BREAK!
B00005QHPQ|5.0|This is such a good cd, from the first moment i put it in the cd player i haven't been able to take it out, its so good, every song, its not a cd where u have to skip tracksto hear ur favorites cuz all the songs are great! I wud recommend this cd to anyone and everyone!
B00005QIPH|5.0|as a very old man who came to listening to television and the modern lovers late in life even though the velvet underground was a mainstay in my college years when there were few people who knew of them or cared and now they would like you to think they were weaned on vu and now they want to compare the strokes to vu or any other band just so when you hear them you have a preconceived idea of what they are supposed to sound like when they probably only want to sound like themselves and that is basically really good stuff and i never heard any of the hype and don't have clue one what anyone is talking about on this and could care less except that this is basically really good stuff and lou would approve i am sure if that is important to you but if you are like me you don't care what lou thinks because all that really matters is that you love lou, you love the strokes, and you enjoy listening and rocking to basically really good stuff.
B00005R2M3|4.0|wow...this cd is AMAZING!!! im listening to it right now (oooo, the fifth time today...) and i have NOT gotten sick of it. each song is unique, in a GOOD way. some may think the spanish is just filler (esp. the spanish versions of two of the english songs), but they sound really neat. she also has a way of using her sexuality in a way thats not trampy, it works for her. she is NOT another one of those &quot;latin explosion&quot; artists, although she is from Colombia; she is also NOT another teeny-bopper-she puts emotion into every word she sings. she has a powerful voice and has a yodel thing which is definitly a talent most singers do NOT have. i recommend this cd to fans of music.
B00004RYZT|5.0|An absolutely fantastic insight into the Rammstein live experience. Superb quality and loads of really interesting facts about the best band in the world! (My view)<BR>The video available from Amazon is the censored version, this annoyed me because I had no idea that there was an uncensored version. Apparently the censors don't like the stage show for Buch Dich. This is a real shame because it is one of the (many) highlights of the show!!!<BR>Buy this DVD at all cost's Rammstein may never tour again and everyone who has ever heard their music and liked it should see them live.<BR>Not as good as being there but a very acceptable second choice!
6305696071|1.0|Very realistic portrayal of a typical streetwalker,excect of course sans std's,needle tracks up and down both arms,psychological problems,30 extra pounds courtesy of 4 pregnancies, and of course many prostitutes look like JR.
B00005QZ7U|5.0|If you are alert, creative, and intelligent, and if you appreciate those qualities in your entertainment, watch -- no, experience Moulin Rouge. I saw this in a wonderful theatre, and now I've seen the DVD, and I must say that while the DVD is top quality, and I will certainly purchase it, I feel truly sorry for anyone who missed this in the theatre.  There's so much to catch your mind won't wander for a moment.  The suggestion by a few that Ewan McGregor and Nicole Kidman cannot sing is absurd. From lead to supporting actors, the performances are terrific.  John Leguizamo must be nominated for something!  This guy has talent to spare.  Here is the reason you needed to purchase surround-sound and a wide-screen TV.  Don't blame this musical or DVD for the limitations of your television or your imagination.
B00005OM4N|2.0|ok...so im a teen....im supposed to love Brit? Her new CD is ok, but I think she did better when she didn't have to make out with a mirror *video:Im a slave 4 u* to be seen as &quot;talented&quot;. I really dont like her remake of &quot;I love Rock and Roll&quot; it sounds pretty bad compared to the real thing. I think she has a talent, maybe not the greatest lyrics...but she needs to figure out a way to make better use of it.
0694518018|3.0|While Graham's text is obviously one of the most important guidebooks for investors written in this century, I have to agree with the reader from L.A. and say that it is quite a difficult read. Perhaps this is why so few people out of the masses have made a fortune in stocks. If we could all understand it, we'd all be rich.
0060934700|2.0|i don't know about this one. admittedly, i am fairly new to gaiman's work. but stardust and neverwhere enchanted me duely, whereas smoke &amp; mirrors has left me unimpressed. a few of the stories had me enthralled until they were through, but most i found myself quite bored with.
B00005OWIU|5.0|This soundtrack just goes to show that John Williams can still write great music if he wants to.  Frankly, some of his other recent soundtracks did nothing to entice me to buy them.  Saving Private Ryan, for instance, was quite forgettable.  But Harry Potter and the Sorcerers's Stone brings back the John Williams we all know and love.  And although I still have not seen the movie Harry Potter, I have read the books, and the musical themes fit the spirit of these stories perfectly.  The themes are magical, mysterious, and full of wonder.  Some people have criticized the music as being too childish or too whimsical.  But that's exactly what John Williams was trying to do with this soundtrack; make whimsical, childish music.  One might as well criticize John Williams for making the Imperial March too ominous or making the Raiders March too heroic.  I say that if the music is doing what the composer intended, then it's good.  So if you want a soundtrack that does its job, then buy Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone.
B00000FCBC|4.0|This may be one of the more original collections ever released.  Most bands by this point in their career would have put out a &quot;best of&quot; collection by now, but these guys instead decide to &quot;return to their roots&quot; by putting out an album full of covers.  What a novel concept!  And for sure, this two-disk collection covers the wide range of Metallica's musicianship.<br />&quot;Turn The Page&quot; and &quot;Tuesday's Gone&quot; vs. &quot;Last Caress/Green Hell&quot; and &quot;So What&quot;.  The former two are slow, somewhat &quot;nice&quot; tracks on disk 1 while the latter two are heavy, hardcore songs on disk 2.  All are notable tracks on this collection.  For sure, disk 1 is more of the &quot;new Metallica&quot; while disk 2 is more of a return to the heavy metal/thrash roots.  Tracks like &quot;Astronomy&quot;, &quot;Whiskey In The Jar&quot;, and especially &quot;Stone Cold Crazy&quot; are among the other notable tracks.  All in all, a unique and interesting listen that is meant for any and all fans of the band.
B00003CY5J|5.0|If you like the movie HEAT then you will definately like this action packed and suspense thriller..The actors do a wonderful job and once you start watching this you wont want to stop the tape until you are done...THUMBS UP to this movie.
B00005QZ7U|1.0|Never in my life have I seen such a piece of garbage.  I heard good reviews about it from my friends, and so I decided to check it out.  I cannot believe this is averaging 4.5 stars. I wish I could give this piece of junk a zero.  This is the worst plot and worst acting I have seen for some time.  I honestly cannot think of a worse movie on this entire earth.  Trust me, this blows.  Absolutely HORRID.
B000003TA4|4.0|Like many others, this was the first Nirvana album i heard and bought.  Many people say this album shaped the music industry forever.  I can agree to that, the songs are just really damn catchy.  They DO have meaning to them(lyrically), but not so much as maybe In Utero or some of the earlier works.<BR>  But my main point is, this isn't what Nirvana was and only was.  A lot of people tend to forgot or they don't even know this. Kurt himself thought that this album was pretty polished up.  Compared to their 600$ recording of 'Bleach', I say that it was polished.<BR>   In conclusion, this is a great album; however it's not as raw in sound as 'Bleach', down to earth lyrically as 'In Utero', nor is it as versatile in both lyric writing and song writing in general as 'Insectecide.'  Take your pick, i took all of them.
B000000P17|1.0|Don't waste your $$.  You won;t find a bigger GNR fan than me. Their albums never leave my car. But this, this is just pure... Another reviewer said \\"Down on the Farm was the best song.\\" It's horrible. Buy the first 4, and the live album and you're set. This one is a bust.
B00001QEE9|1.0|Pinocchio is one of my favorite movies and my children love it as well.  What a gift it was to get it on DVD!  But upon putting it in the player today, found out that the Prince of Egypt was actually on it.  The cover and holder showed Pinocchio.  This was a very sad mistake by Buena Vista Home Entertainment.
B00004U60I|5.0|My son received this DVD for Christmas at the age of eight weeks.  I thought he wouldn't be too in to it just yet because of his age but from the time it started his eyes were glued to the tv.  He also received Baby Mozart and seems to enjoy Baby Bach more,although he will watch either.  Luckily the DVD has the repeat play option, as my son would watch it all day if we let him!  I recommend this for anyone with an infant!
0887306667|3.0|A &quot;law&quot; should predict the future, not just explain the past.  This book gives you a good explanation of how some marketing campaigns have worked (or failed) in the past, but it's hard to see how they apply in the future.  Too many of the laws contradict or cancel each-other out.<br />While they do a nice job of explaining why certain laws lead to the success or failure of a product in the past, six years later their track record for using these laws to predict the future is pretty poor.  Hayes is gone, not the leader in the modem industry, Microsoft did succeed in overextending their brand name and toppling Lotus 1-2-3 and WordPerfect, Pen Computers (i.e. PDAs) have taken off... <br />This book provides some interesting food for thought and is worth reading.  Its poor predictions, however, underscore the fact that marketing is still a very human activity and it's anybody's guess how a particular campaign is going to turn out.  Of course, the &quot;Law of Unpredictability&quot; covers that one too.
B00004Z459|5.0|Ok, its got to be said... THIS CD RULES!!! Its mix of rap, rock, and metal make it great for people who like all kinds of music. Also, it's lyrics are catchy... and they're not explicit so parents shouldn't mind hearing them blasted out of their teens' rooms (so much). When I saw the vid &quot;In The End&quot; I was totally hooked and I still love this band and CD!! If you like LP, you also might try some P.O.D., Bizkit, and Mudvayne... although, they do have some explicit lyrics. But I totally reccomend buying this CD... belive me, it's worth it!!!!!!!!!!
B00005QDW1|3.0|I anxiously awaited this CD, as Return of Saturn is one of the finest albums releaseed in 2000 and one of my personal favorites.  I was a bit disappointed with the first single, first off- &quot;Hey Baby&quot;.  While i am glad it is accelerating up the charts and getting great airplay, it sounds as if no doubt has sold out.  Sure, it has reggae and new wave, but where is the ska?  Thats what No Doubt is all about.  I wasnt a follower of them in the Tragic Kingdom days, so i'm not going to bash them for going a different way, in fact, i prefer their new wave sound.  But this CD is just pop.  They sound like they were great songs but sugar-coated just for the mass market.  They still manage to keep their sound different from other bands with few and far between experimental sounds, in fact, &quot;Underneath it All&quot; is a breath of fresh air for them.  But as the CD goes on, it seems as if they have taken the road Garbage has taken and gone all pop.  The intelligent, deep lyrics are gone and filled with shallow lyrics despirated to rhyme with eachother.  And the sole ballad on the CD, Running, is likeable the first 2 listens, but after you start to remember the words to the song, you just go &quot;eecchhhhhhh....&quot;  I love no doubt, and i'm glad they are finding commercial success once again, but i just wish they didnt have to turn to the mass market to sell records.
B00005QDW1|4.0|&quot;Tragic Kingdom&quot; was the first No Doubt cd to break into the mainstream, spawning hit singles, world tours, and giving the entire world a look at No Doubt's unique hybrid of Ska, Reggae, Pop and Rock. Then came &quot;Return Of Saturn&quot;... but all the things that made No Doubt Bouncy and Fun were gone...<br />This is No Doubt as they are meant to sound. Fun, danceable, pop music. This album gets back to the sound they started out with on their first Indie release, never mind tragic kingdom. Rock Steady is a polished effort, worked on by a tireless amount of producers. &quot;Hella Good&quot; rocks out... &quot;Underneath It All&quot; is a slow Ska beat... and of course, first single &quot;Hey Baby&quot; is No Doubt at their finest... all the elements of their style come together on this track (with an awesome appearence by Bounty Killer). Pick this up if you loved Tragic Kingdom, or if you just love to dance and have a good time.
0812550706|3.0|I'm on a science fiction reading binge right now, and I read Ender's Game based upon recommendations here and the fact that it won the Hugo and Nebula awards.  Take these glowing reviews with a grain of salt.  Ender's Game would have blown me away too....when I was 11.<BR> On one hand, Ender's Game is a page turning good read.  I truly enjoyed it, and I give it three stars because it was easily better than average.  The downside is that this book is nowhere near as good as the reviews here would lead one to believe.  Essentially, it's a children's book, and judging from the rave reviews, which seem to be mainly from children, a very successful one.<BR> While enjoyable overall, there are elements of the plot that are so unrealistic as to be annoying.  The characters, even Ender, are one-dimensional.  Ender's brother and sister are just a bit too &quot;smart&quot; to be believable.  The ending is unsatisfying.  Nevertheless, Card does have some insights into leadership and the burdens that intelligence places on children, a theme that undoubtedly resonates with many science fiction fans.<BR> I might recommend this book to a child as an intro to science fiction.  I'm glad I read it, but I would never recommend it to an adult.  There's just too much science fiction out there that is clearly superior.
B00005QZWI|4.0|A soundtrack is usually an album that has all the vocal music to a movie, with perhaps an instrumental or two and maybe a few lines of dialogue. A score is an album that contains most of the instrumental music from a movie. Back in the day, a soundtrack included all of the music from a movie on one album. However, the studio money makers realized that they could make more money by splitting the instrumentals from the vocal songs. That's why a lot of films have both a soundtrack and a score.  With that said, there isn't a lot of vocal music in LOTR:FOTR. The music in the film is mostly instrumental and is used to compliment what occurs on screen. However, there is much good music from the film that didn't make it to this soundtrack. I have a sneaky suspiscion that another soundtrack to the film will be released later (much like what happend with TITANIC). Personally, I loved this album. Granted, the music only compliments the scenes in the movie and doesn't enhance them much. However, a movie is a combination of many elements and if the soundtrack is the only thing people remember, it's usually not a very good film. Fortunately, that's not the case with LOTR:FOTR. Overall, a decent cd with some good, and a little great music from one of the best films in 2001.
B00005R2BG|1.0|&quot;Moulin Rouge&quot;is nothing but a bunch of random scenes <BR>tossed together with random songs slapped on.The costumes<BR>were from different eras,too(like the 1920's showgirl costumes).<BR>If this is supposed to take place in 1900,why are there <BR>things like 1930's style buildings and songs that came<BR>from the 40's,50's and 60's?The guy in the ringmaster <BR>outfit was terribly out-of-place for a club like that-it<BR>looks like someone yanked him out of a circus tent and<BR>stuck him at the nightclub/bar.The actors yell their lines <BR>instead of just talking normally,and the acting is WAY<BR>overdone.I don't remember who directed this movie,but they did<BR>a horrible job!The only thing this movie has going for it is<BR>the songs.That's all.If you want &quot;Moulin Rouge&quot;,I suggest just<BR>buying the CD,and forget about seeing the movie.
B0000009S3|5.0|in praising this record to the skies, everyone else has beaten me to it. Upon talking to or reading Zappa fans like the ones here, youll note near unanimity in the sentiment that this was a brilliant record. Six songs, one with lyrics, not sung by Zappa. Genius jamming on guitar and electric violin, well arranged and very pleasing to the ear, above all. Im just getting into Zappa, and he's hit and miss sometimes, but this is a big, honkin' HIT.
0385505833|5.0|I ordered this book from Amazon not quite knowing what to expect. Being a fan of Grisham's legal thrillers, I was pleasantly surprised at his ability to tell a different type of story. The book is a quick read, fun, and extremely enjoyable. The storyline incorporates lots of light humor while really making a point about the frenetic holiday season. Recommended to readers who enjoy light humor and fun, but don't look for a lengthy legal plot from Skipping Christmas. To borrow a line from CNN's movie critic Paul Clinton regarding a recent movie, 'The literary version of a Happy Meal -- tasty and filling, not particularly nutritious, but generally pleasing for all.'
B000001FN8|5.0|I can't see it why people were so dissapointed by this album. Of course it's not as great as Love at first sting, but what album would be? The first four songs are better than good, and the album in a whole is better than for example Crazy world. They say that it's &quot;polished&quot;, but I can't really see that. They took the unnecessary crap out of their songs years earlier already, I don't see it as a negative thing. All together definitely worth buying. This is like three and a half stars in scorpions-scale, but hey, we're talking about the scorpions.
6304493711|5.0|The effects of personal want, need, love and desire on the friendships of a circle of eclectic individuals is examined with a spot of humor in the witty, clever and oh-so-British comedy of love, romance and finding that special someone, \\"Four Weddings and a Funeral,\\" directed by Mike Newell.  Hugh Grant and Andie MacDowell head a delightful ensemble cast in this story of a group of long-time friends, all single, who watch and participate over a period of months as one by one those amongst them step up at last to the altar.  Of them all, Charles (Grant) seems the most likely-- and at the same time the least likely-- to be next.  Young, handsome and charismatic, Charles has no problem developing a relationship (he's had a number, in fact, as we learn in one particularly hilarious scene), but sustaining one is seemingly beyond his grasp.  Until, at the wedding of one of his friends, he meets Carrie (MacDowell), an American, and she quickly enchants him.  It is not the end of the story, however; for Charles, Carrie and the audience, it's only-- as they say-- the beginning.<br /> Set in contemporary England, one of the aspects of this film that makes it so engaging is the propriety with which the humor is presented.  Refreshingly subtle, there's more of Noel Coward than Tom Green or Rob Schneider to it; a matter of manners, mores and innuendo taking precedence over gross-out, in-your-face, shock schlock humor.  And though Grant and MacDowell are at the forefront of the piece, Newell does an excellent job of developing all of the characters, succinctly supplying enough detail to each individual to give the film some depth and dimension, without having to actually go too deep.  He never lets you forget that first and foremost, this is a comedy.  There's some insight provided, but this is not an in-depth commentary on human nature, though there are some overtones and implications in that direction (Charles is always late to the weddings, for example; perhaps a subconsciousdenial of the impending nuptials?).  Most importantly, the characterizations are rich, and the story is involving and presented with an even flow that allows you to effortlessly be swept away with it.  <br /> Certain actors make a career out of playing a variation of the same character in film after film, striving for that definitive portrayal.  W.C. Fields played the hen-pecked husband in a number of films, finally perfecting that particular character in the person of Harold Bissonette in \\"It's A Gift.\\"  For Hugh Grant, it's the retiring, somewhat self-conscious and stammering, eyelid fluttering charmer, of which he's done a variation in such films as \\"Sense and Sensibility,\\" \\"The Englishman Who Went Up A Hill, But Came Down A Mountain,\\" Notting Hill\\" and \\"Mickey Blue Eyes.\\"  But Charles is his definitive portrayal of that character, the one in which he achieves the balance and honesty that makes the character so believable.  It's a good bit of work by Grant, and definitely one of his most memorable performances.<br /> Andie MacDowell, meanwhile, gives a rather composed performance as Carrie, the quiet American with a reserved bluntness who captivates Charles.  MacDowell brings a sense of quietude to the role that is sensuously seductive, which lends credibility to Charles' infatuation with her.  It's a role for which MacDowell is perfectly suited, as it allows her to play effectively to her naturally calm demeanor and exquisite beauty and femininity.<br /> In a part that has to be an actor's dream, Simon Callow is absolutely exuberant as Gareth, one of the fixtures of Charles' circle of friends.  More than just an effervescent character, Gareth is something of the conscience of the film, laughing away and laying bare any and all pretense or hypocrisy like a modern day flesh-and-blood Spirit of Christmas Present.  It's a character that gives needed balance and perspective to the film, and he's wonderfully played by Callow.<br /> Also turning in especially noteworthy performances are John Hannah as Matthew; Kristin Scott Thomas, who is quite alluring as Fiona; James Fleet as Tom, a character very reminiscent of his Hugo in the TV series \\"The Vicar of Dibley,\\" (and very effective here); Charlotte Coleman, memorable in the role of Scarlett; and Rowan Atkinson as the hapless Father Gerald.<br /> Rounding out the supporting cast are David Bower (David), Timothy Walker (Angus), Sara Crowe (Laura), Anna Chancellor (Henrietta), Simon Kunz (John), David Haig (Bernard), Sophie Thompson (Lydia Jane) and Corin Redgrave (Hamish).  There's enough twists and turns along the way to keep this film unpredictable, including one scene near the end that initially seems so mean-spirited that it may have you biting your fist and crying, \\"Oh, NO!\\"  But, not to worry, Newell provides an instant resolution consistent with the rest of the film, and it not only works but gets a good laugh to boot.  Entertaining, pleasant and funny, \\"Four Weddings and a Funeral\\" makes for a satisfying, feel-good cinematic experience that just seems so wonderfully civilized amid the seemingly endless rancor abounding in our world today.  It's what's known as the magic of the movies.
B00005JGAF|5.0|I like a lot of music, everything from uh Louis Armstrong to the Germs, but brother this is the best of em' all. This album is perfection, every time I play it I feel even more alive. So what did Rhino do, they made it better!!! First off, the fidelity is unbelievable. For all of you that have &quot;All This Stuff And More Vol 2&quot;, you can throw that away cause here is the real thing! Not to mention you get the bonus cuts that you did on &quot;ATSAMV2&quot;, including 2 of the greatest cuts they never released, S.L.U.G.(recorded at Gold Star Studios no less) and, It's A Long Way Back To Germany (well it was a b-side). Do yourself a favor and order this now!!!!!! RIP Joey
B00004YRQA|5.0|This card is much better than those other bigger less expensive cards. It costs more for a reson. Its higher quility and wont act up in any way. Plus there is no need to install anything just plug it in and poof there you go. You've got everything right there. Also since I'm on the subject go buy Grand Theft Auto III (GTA III) Its the funnest game.
B00005QK3W|5.0|This CD is the best work he has done in over 20 years.<BR>Any of these songs could be on a Beatles album.<BR>There is a freshness here that has been missing on Pauls work<BR>since the '70s.  Flaming Pie, Flowers in the dirt were good<BR>albums, but typical for Paul, and not much new, and don't even touch the quality of this CD.<br />This album is a total, welcomed departure from old worn out,<BR>song formulas he has used, until now.  This album gets better<BR>with each listening, and I am sure will be a must have in<BR>any Beatles or McCartney fan's collection. <br />My favorite album had been Venus and Mars, good rock album.<BR>This is now my new favorite McCartney album.  Good to hear<BR>Paul is back!
B000002GBK|5.0|When Yes broke up the first time in 1975, interestingly enough all the former members of the band came out with solo or duo albums. All of them produced their albums at about the same time and all of them combined an orchestra with their works.<br />I like Steve Howe's &quot;The Steve Howe Album&quot;. Double Rondo is a work that Steve composed and highlights his guitar prowness. However, Wakeman's work is more impressive. Rick also composed every song and instrumentation. While he composed in such a way as to highlight his own skills also; the overall level of the composition is such that Wakeman's keyboarding is much more integrated into the overall composition than his fellow former (and future) bandsmen from 'Yes' integrated their skills into their albums.<br />Each title of this album focuses on one of the characters of the King Arthur legend - except for the final title entitled &quot;The Final Battle&quot;. Wakeman captures his interpretation of the character in each title. For example, 'Merlin the Magician' has some very whimsical parts to it sounding like a player piano playing in a old US Western movie.<br />Wakeman has the English Chamber Chorus supplying vocals in each title - sometimes producing a very dramatic effect. Rick plays a variety of keyboards: grand piano, mellotron, synthesizer, electric organ, lyritron. Trumpets from the orchestra in 'The Final Batlle' remind me of wakeman's syntesizer towards the end of the yes song 'Heart of the Sunrise'. <br />If you like early Yes (The Yes album, Fragile, CTE,TO Topo Oceans), then I think you will like this work by Wakeman - even though it has a more ochestral sound then Yes. out of all the works by former Yesman in ~1975; I think this has the most 'Yes' sound to it.
B00005OM4N|5.0|i was a big fan of britney during her 1st album but i'll admit that when i bought her 2nd one i was very disappointed. now she has this one out and the 1st time i listened to it i was like WOW cuz she totally matured and shes stressing that in this cd. i could never see anyone giving this cd one star, or even 2,3,or 4.. it deserves like,10! lots of people dis brit but for the main reason they are jelous. most of them are probably like,14,15,16.. i'm 15 but i dont disrespect her because shes beautiful. people say shes &quot;...&quot; but why? cuz they dont look as good as her i guess. shes not ... shes just proud of what she has and she should be. i love all the songs on this cd but my 3 fav are #2.. overprotected,which stresses that shes gettin older and needs to be free to do what she wants. #6. anticipating.. which has a really neat 70's beat and tight lyrics, and #10.. i love rock n roll.. hot lyrics,same ol beat but great song. . brits voice also helps a lot because it's unique and she does do all that screaming in the background which a ton of pop singers do and it like,goes right thru u. keep it comin brit!

0140288503|5.0|Bowden absolutely nails the chaos and fear and confusion of battle.  This book is riveting in its detail of the &quot;fog of war&quot;.  Not a book about foreign policy, but about what the implementation of the policy entails.  America is the greatest nation that ever existed, with distinct and huge technological and military advantage; however it is not invincible.  What essentially amounted to a well armed gang, was able to penetrate that military might.  We grossely underestimated the Somali people's will and capability and it cost lives.  In my view the American military was triumphant against incredible odds, but ultimately the political establishment did not have the stomach for any further losses.  This certainly was a lesson learned in light of today's environment. We are far more reluctant to commit our troops to battle or peacekeeping, relying instead on indescriminant bombing, and dissident forces to fight the battles (not necessarily a criticism).<br />Bowden does not concentrate on the rationale, nor does he pass judgement on its viability, he concentrates on the men who fought that day. This in itself is laudable, since most journalists would have given in to their own personal biases. Though told primarily from an American point of view (as it should be), it was amazing that he was able to get interviews with Somali fighters, and other foreign nationals present at the time.  A very horrifying yet refreshing look at the results of what is happening in the world outside of our immediate view.  One hundred and fifty soldiers went to war against a city with a population of a million people and the sleeping giant still slept.  Until this book was written, this battle was not even a footnote in American history.  America is impacting other countries in ways that people had not ever considered.  Bowden makes that strikingly clear.  What is also becoming clear as time passes, is that skirmishes such as this one impact foreign policy far more than people think.
B00005JG6R|5.0|I love this movie, but the diggitally remasterd version wasn't as good. The picture and sound quallity was perfect, just the vocies were chnaged.   I don't like the way the voice of a digimon Character being the vocice on insane Tetsuo.  It doesn't work for me.  but still it;s a must see
B00005NWM3|5.0|This is an AWESOME CD...I got it for Christmas and it's the best one I own! Some of the songs are just ok, but the majority of them are really good. And I'm someone who prefers pop, so for me to like it means its a really great album!! I totally recommend it!
0385505833|5.0|What a fun and comical book!  I definitely think they should make a movie out of this one. It would be the new Christmas Vacation with Chevy Chase (a classic).
B00005OM4N|5.0|Britney has definately improved. I wasn't so sure I wanted to get this CD because I didn't think her other two CD's were that great, but this one is much better. It is a more grown-up, but still innocent Briteny. This CD has a lot of girl-power songs. Out of all her Cd's I recommend this one.
B00005QK3W|5.0|Forget the know-nothings that enjoy bashing the big Mac, this is one of Sir Paul's finest albums -EVER-! Great tracks with a highly charged emotional edge, stylistically this album goes from strength to strength. Rinse the Raindrops is likely Paul's hardest rocking track since Helter Skelter! Pure bliss. Also forget the lackluster sales that merely point to a public infatuated with disposable pop. This album is a keeper and will be hard to find in any 2nd hand shop! I give a big tip 'o the hat to Paul for this magnificent effort!
B000002BE9|5.0|My Grandaughter first told me about Fiona Apple. I watched her video Criminal on MTV and immediatly thought what a voice and what piercing blue eyes!! I got the CD listened to it many times and realized this is pure talent, nothing trumped up to make her sound better than she is, no instruments to cover up a faltering voice,just pure honest talent.This God given talent will take her as far as she wants to go.The only other female singer I thought this much about was Linda Rondstat, another pure talent.
0790729628|3.0|I have owned both copies and found the older copy with voice naration a much better choice, Due to the lack of background thoughts it looses much of the depth of the emotions and conflicting thoughts. The voice naration adds much needed insite to the main characters growing need to change and rid himself of old prejudices, and becomming a true hero with human weaknesses. I highly recomend getting the naritive copy to see the inner struggle, and triumph, over the human weakness dwelling in the hero of this story.
020161622X|5.0|In this book Hunt and Thomas have compiled a collection of 70 tips, thoughts, and techniques that are a must-study for every programmer regardless of skill or experience.<br />The tips cover all programming topics.  Issues include programming style, languages, time management, planning, customer relationships, and spotlights on the project lifecycle.  Some of the tips in the book seem obvious, but are often forgotten even by experienced programmers.  Some tips are things that I initially was surprised by, but after reading the thorough explanation the topic came to light and became clear.<br />This is a good book that can be read off and on in sections, picked up at any time for a quick refresher on good programming.<br />I would heartily recommend this book for all programmers, whether you're a casual dabbler in VB, a web perl scripter, or you write unix system utilities in C.
6304806426|1.0|Pure rubbish and a complete load of old tripe. Do not bother with this film as it's mind-numbingly dull, complacent, self-satisfied, smug and self-indulgent. It beggers belief that it received Academy Awards but if you like David Lean without the skill of direction or political acuity than you just may like it. Otherwise, leave it alone and let it die in peace.
B00000257O|4.0|Herbie's last HEADHUNTERS-era disc that is still a fairly rewarding one for those open to his mid-'70's fusion of jazz with progressive funk/r&amp;b.  As with the previous few discs, Hancock and Maupin in particular get ample solo space, with Herbie still trying to integrate his talent for improvisation with his vision for genre-hopping.  The music is a bit lighter in texture than the prior three albums in this style, and the repetitive semi-vocal track DOIN' IT hints at the rapid musical decline to come.  Nonetheless, check this CD out if you are into HH's 1973-1976 period.
0789723107|5.0|This book is one of the best web development books out there. Truly a &quot;two thumbs up!&quot; It's short and to-the-point style and intuitive graphics give it the edge it needs over boring 400 page manuals.<br />&quot;Don't Make Me Think!&quot; teaches you the one thing your REALLY need to know before designing a website... how to make it USABLE. It doesn't matter if it uses the latest technologies and looks awesome, if people can't find what they're looking for they're going to leave.<br />I can't wait for Steve Krug's next book...
B00000255O|4.0|Hancock adds a horn section to his then-current r&amp;b/funk/jazz music to good effect, both on the uptempo cuts and on such ballads as SUN TOUCH.  At this point, Hancock's unique mix of jazz with funk/r&amp;b was still producing considerably earthier results than the tepid crossover attempts of most of his peers.  The hard-core grooves on such cuts as THE TRAITOR and HANG UP YOUR HANG UPS compare favorably with those of the P-Funk crew and James Brown.  Effective wah-wah/funk guitar work give the groove-oriented tracks further bite, and Hancock's own synth sounds and solos thankfully haven't lost their edge.  Typically timeless solos by the likes of reedmen Wayne Shorter [BUBBLES] and Bennie Maupin indicate that improvisation was still a vital part of Herbie's musical vision at this point in time. Pick this CD up after you get HEADHUNTERS and THRUST, but before SECRETS.
0060934913|4.0|Bourdain's engaging prose and often hilarious narrative make this a very enjoyable read for all, especially those who love to cook, eat out, or ever dreamt of being a chef. I found the book to be less \\"shocking\\" than it was hyped to be, but I was not disappointed in its contents. Bourdain may offend a few folks with his frank, if not (at times) crass, narrative, but I think that most will enjoy this book on some level. I can't say how true his account of a professional kitchen rings, although I suspect the world he describes more accurately depicts New York City than the rest of the country.<br />It's ironic that Bourdain is somewhat disdainful of the celebrity chefs who appear on the food network and write fancy cookbooks, but he apparently lept at the opportunity to do his own show. While I haven't seen it, the commercials looks like his chapter on eating in Japan- where he lauds the eating of foods bizzarre and exotic to the western palette- \\"extreme cuisine,\\" in today's commercial parlance.  This isn't a book I would keep on my shelves and return to it time and again, But it's one of those great books you blast through once and then pass on to a friend, who thanks you for it and passes it to another.
B00002R0MC|5.0|This is by far the best box set I own. It showcases Marley's talents from beginning to end and even gives you a beautiful acoustic medely of some of Bob's wonderful music. The songs are pretty much done in chronological order from the early days of ska, with Bunny Wailer and Peter Tosh backing Marley, on through the rock steady era and finally into the era of reggae mystically and magically laid out in a way only Bob could do it.<br />Please don't be fooled by all the Marley 3-cd sets and false box sets out there. You WILL be disappointed when you buy most of these sets (much of the songs were stolen then pirated and ended up victim to some very VERY bad production not to mention some aren't even Bob Marley at all). <br />This box, Songs of Freedom, however, will NOT disappoint you. Even if you aren't into the old ska sound all that much you will soon find that, after a few plays, you will enjoy the ska and that disc one (ska/rock-steady) will become a favorite among the four. I actually enjoy disc two the best due to the acoustic medley, but even Screwface, Lick Samba, the alternate Trenchtown Rock, etc...make this a great collection.<br />If you are just starting out with Bob Marley then I recommend starting with Songs of Freedom. Again, stick to THIS box set and if you want more Marley then move onto the original Bob Marley album releases, Legend and Natural Mystic. These are all a bit more pricey, but you get quality.<br />Finally and again...stay away from all other Marley box sets even if they are [amt] for 5 cd's. You will get 5 cd's chock full of garbage. Believe me this set is worth the money you pay.<BR>(Check out Peter Tosh Box set and individual album releases also and Bunny Wailer Blackheart Man and Rootsman Skanking. I haven't seen too many bootlegs by these two performers that were all that bad, but if you don't know for sure then stick to the recommendations.)<br />One Love!
6302038308|5.0|Well what can I say for this outlandish crazy movie, alot of damn fun thats for sure. Plenty of excitement and action to spare as well as alot of laughs. Not really that scary, I guess it had its moments but like I said it is exciting and loaded with tons of surprises,and this is when Bruce starts coming up with his famous quotes. Well as far as my theory goes for this being so similar to the first one, its like after Bruce stopped the curse on the first one, the demon knocked him like well back in time if you will. Like a bad dream and made his memory forget everything. Like it showed a glimpse of the demon doing that in this one.That or it was just made to make no sense whatsoever kind of sequel. Anyway the special effects well some of them are really good, yet others are really dumb but I guess back when this movie came out the effects were pretty damn good. But now if you see it, dont think its a bad movie because of the not so great special effects, its quite funny how they are done like when the woman is dancing around with no head and when the possessed guy floats in the air having major slow motion and when the grandma demon's head turned into some weird type of ostrich. Its all just meant to be crazy fun and has major hilarious moments. Poor Ash, you see the hellish times hes been having. Add this to your collection you can like it more then the first or less as well as just as much which I do. As for Army of Darkness well thats on its own. Get this great horror, comedy movie, and you wont be dissapointed, however it isn't quite as violent as the first yet still often has major bloody parts. And for the final yes the once like invicible demon is now exposed, wow now you see why it was so strong. Enjoy!!!
B00005U4UV|5.0|Now here's one of those films I shouldn't have watched in 85 when I was 15, but I am glad I did. I recently bought the dvd after so many years of not having seen the film and was pleasantly suprised. First of all it is a horror with sick humor and nice gore thrown in for added taste. A slightly insane medical student creates a life giving re-animation juice that, when injected into the base of the brain, brings the dead back to life. Not fun for the previously dead nor is it fun for the student doctor. (The dead come back to life angry and seemingly in pain most of the time due to incorrect dosages of the green re-animation juice. Sort of like the dead come back in Pet Sematary by Stephen King). <br />The crazy med student (Jeffrey Combs)shacks up with another medical student and begins to perform his studies in his rented room and basement. The medical professor at the college finds out about Herbert's (Jeffrey Combs) work and tries to steal the invention, but things get bad and then worse for this cast of characters thanks to this thieving attitude (it would have been bad anyway).<br />The visuals are unsettling, but well done. Not a stupid, boring, or overdone film. It stands alone and is very original. Believe me, there are a lot of really crappy medical horror films out there, but this one does everything the way it should be done. I appreciate this film on the same level that I appreciate Phantasm. They are two totally different movies in reality, but for some reason, in my mind, I find them very similar as far as watchability. That is not to say that if you don't like Phantasm you will not like Re-Animator. I just find similarity between the two for some reason. Can't pinpoint the reason.<br />I have to mention that the acting in this film is great for the intentions of the film. Make sure you aren't eating while watching and enjoy.
6305095566|5.0|This movie is just one of kind, great fun, very bloody. Not necessarilly really gory, I always look at gore to be maybe alot of decapitation and showing guts, however this movie had some of that but not enough to think of this as the goriest movie ever. But it is one of the bloodiest and wildest. Story of course involves some college students going up to a somewhat abandon cabin and the evil starts from there and how they unleash it, you must see for yourself. The acting was well ok, however Bruce Campbell himself did awesome I think he is a great highly underrated actor. This movie is very scary, or exciting if you will as it is also very funny sometimes, like when the possessed women say funny statements like (kill her if you can loverboy, and Were gonna get you not another peep, its just so corny yet funny.) Gets you back to enjoying the movie instead of wanting to get grossed out or terrified. The work on the demons or zombies, though they didnt seem like major flesh eaters, just demons in human form are quite excellent, the rough sketching and so on. Anyone that doesnt like this filmin my opinion just doesnt like horror in general because this is a damn straight horror classic and will stay that way. If you like entertaining, quiet, keep you guessingtype of horror movies then see evil dead. I lovethe whole series but the first one is more of a major horror movie then the others,  however they are all outstanding. Dont be fooled by the ending, there is more of that too come. Also I think I figured out why Evil dead 2's storyline was so similar to this one, find out my theory on my Evil dead 2 review. Well enjoy this completely great horror movie, its one of the best.
B00005N9CV|2.0|After the immensely enjoyable &quot;When I Look in Your Eyes&quot; CD, I had high hopes and expectations for this highly-anticipated follow-up.  Krall owes a lot to her &quot;When I Look...&quot; CD, which converted more fans to jazz and Krall than any of her previous ones.  Imagine my surprise when I plopped &quot;Look of Love&quot; into my player.  Has Diana or her producers been listening to Lawrence Welk??!!  This CD lacks originality, purpose, or inspiration.  It seems the record company was trying to cash in on one of their biggest cash cows!!  I always thought Krall was one to play a bit too safe, but not THIS safe!!  She should also fire her publicist for making her pose in that hooker outfit on the CD cover---what an atrocious picture!!  I'm sorry to be getting down on Krall, but I'm sure as a fan, there are others like me who are very disappointed with this CD.  What about her piano-playing, they don't even get one song to show off here---it's all muzak strings thru and thru.<br />Please, Diana, next time go back to your roots and come up with something more original----and please, put SOMETHING over that dress!!
B00005JKG7|5.0|When it comes to horror movies,John Carpenter is the master! His movies have a certain type of MOOD or ATMOSPHERE,I can't explain it,but if your a fan,you know what I mean.As far as THE FOG,It's a well told ghost story with an erie feel to it.A small seaside town,a ghost ship,and a cast of great horror stars like Jamie Lee Curtis,Hal Holbrook,and Adrienne Barbeau,blend to make this a fun,and spooky movie.It's one that you'll want to cuddle up under the blankets,and turn out the lights! If you've seen HALLOWEEN or THE THING on dvd,you know you're in for a frightful treat!
0790735431|4.0|A little background.  First of all, there really was a plane called the Memphis Belle.  It is traditionally considered the first B-17 to complete the obligatory 25 missions and survive.  If you are going to learn about the real 'Memphis Belle', I highly recommend you watch the William Wyler documentary, made during World War II, that chronicles the story of the actual plane and its crew.  You may also want to read the book that came out in the past year called &quot;The Man Who Flew the Memphis Belle&quot; about the Belle's pilot, Robert Morgan, because it is a fascinating book about a man who went on to fly B29's in the Pacific after surviving in Europe.  And to watch a movie that accurately chronicles the trials and tribulations of bomber crewmen in Europe in WWII, I recommend &quot;Twelve O'Clock High&quot; and &quot;Pistol Packing Mama&quot;.<BR>That having been said, I must add that most air veterans think that the 1990 &quot;Memphis Belle&quot; movie is unrealistic, and in many ways they are right.  However, I have done enough research to appreciate that the film is a great way to get introduced to the exploits of the brave aircrews who flew over Germany in World War II.  It is an entertaining film.  I think the director would have been much better off NOT calling the film &quot;The Memphis Belle&quot;, because the story is mostly fiction.  So why did he/she do so?  It was put out by the daughter of William Wyler, who made the original movie, in part as a tribute to her father.  Thus the name.<br />The actual pilot of the real Memphis Belle was asked about the movie, and said that it appeared to him that the writers had taken everything that had happened to the crew over all 25 missions and compressed them into one hellish mission.  Indeed, the crew deals with about every in-flight emergency imaginable on mission twenty-five.  This is one exciting piece of film.<BR>Roger Freeman, one of the great air historians, also served as an advisor on the film.  The filmgot a lot of things right, too, in addition to the gaffes that many air vets notice.<BR>The joy of seeing three of the surviving B-17's flying together again in this movie is worth the price, in my book.<BR>I recommend the movie with the caveat that it is not FACT, but historical fiction, and recommend that if you like it, that you not stop until you see the real &quot;Memphis Belle&quot; video from the forties and also read Robert Morgan's book.  You will come away with renewed and increased admiration for the brave men who flew missions in the war to save the world.  These men flew knowing full well that each mission could well be their last.  They flew no fewer than 25 such missions at war's beginning when the odds were terrible, and as many as 35 by war's end.  This movie is a fitting tribute to their sacrifices.
0440219078|5.0|This book was awesome.To be compltely honest i dont enjoy reading that much.But this book grabbed my attention i read a few pages and it didnt bore me.The book was very good and i didnt want to put it down.Its like a cliffhanger the whole way and the ending will amaze you.I reallyd did enjoy this book and i read it when i was in 6th gr. and i compltely understood it and everything.It was very exciting thats all i can say and for the many other people out there that dont like to read that much just read this book you wont want to quit,.And the cover may not look exciting but the book is and once u read the book it all fits in and you will find yourself always thinking you figured it out but then it changes it suspense all the way i loved it
0790729644|5.0|Unforgiven is one of the rare westerns in that it doesn't have somebody shooting at someone else every five minutes.  Instead, Unforgiven takes time to tell its story and it saves the gunfighting until later.  This movie has to be one of the most realistic westerns that have ever been made.  It isn't like the westerns that come out today that have cowboys who look like they could be super-models, the movie actually tells and shows the viewer how the west really was, it was a struggle for suvival and it was a sad, ugly place.  The movie is about how a town prostitute is cut-up by a cowboy and how the other prostitutes hire Clint Eastwood, Morgan Freeman, and Jaimz Woolvett to go and murder the two men who commited the crime.  What follows is a look at the strong human emotion to be apprehensive at taking a person's life and the characteristic of some who have no emotion when it comes to taking a life.  This deservedly won the Oscars it received.
038533348X|5.0|This was my first Vonnegut book, now I'm hooked. The book was like nothing I've ever read. The only book that is even remotely similar is Catch-22. I actually laughed out loud a couple of times. Read this book, you will enjoy it.
B00003CXTF|5.0|When I watched &quot;Pearl Harbor&quot; I expected it to be more history than a love story, but a love story is what we got. I really enjoyed the movie although it wasn't what I had thought it would be.  It was a very moving story.  It really gives you the feeling of what life was like back then and the real terrors and bravery that came along with protecting the country.  Their was also the life-long friendship factor that I thought made the movie what it is.  The special effects could not have been any better. Over all, I was extremely pleased with everything right down to the casting, which also could not have been better.
B000056K04|1.0|I really am very disappointed with Dave's style of music on this CD.  Its almost disgusting!  Sure some people may like the style, but its not Dave.  No studio release will ever beat Under the Table and Dreaming.  I sure hope Dave's next studio release will not be like this one, this one was completely disgusting.  Everyday was the only song i could put up with, and even that one i was just sitting there like \\"Is this even Dave Matthews?\\"  It is not at all Dave's style.  So if you have never heard this CD and like Dave's original style, DO NOT GET THIS CD!  You will be very disappointed.  If you think any of those songs would be good live, I've been to 15 DMB Concerts this year and i heard about every song on that CD live, IT IS NOT ANY BETTER!  The Space Between just is sickening.  I'm not saying that any of the songs are bad, none of these songs are Dave.
B00005JKT8|4.0|This movie was both romantic and comical. Hugh Jackman was quite convincing as a Duke from the 1800s.  He was as handsome and charming as Meg Ryan was witty and cute.  Meg Ryan was in true form in this movie including &quot;Meg Ryan's&quot; quirky smiles and frowns.  Her character is lovably as usual.  If you enjoyed You've Got Mail, you'll enjoy Meg in this one as well.  However, beware...it IS a &quot;fairy tale&quot; with a modern twist. For us hopeless romantics, it is a win!

This is not about a dumb blonde.  Its about a smart blonde with mainly shallow pursuits who decides to change the direction of her life.  Not her fault that most around her don't understand what's happening.  Its also about character.  Elle has it and most around her don't.<br />Its also about Reese Witherspoon.  She carries this light hearted flick almost singlehandedly.  Go Goldie... er..  I mean Reese.<br />This one's a keeper.  Along with 'Ferris Bueller's Day Off', 'Clueless' and 'Drive Me Crazy'.<br />Enjoy!
B000058T5E|4.0|Jeff Beck continues to forge new sonic frontiers with his trusty Stratocaster. Combining electronic drum loops and sampling with his now legendary six-string attack, the instrumentals on You Had it Coming have more in common with the Chemical Brothers or Massive Attack than with the blues-rock revivalism in which 60s contemporaries like Clapton and Page currently choose to indulge. <br />Given to long periods of inactivity and years between releasing albums, you could say that Beck has been on somewhat of a roll recently. You Had it Coming is Beck's second release in just under two years, following his Who Else? album from 1999. <br />On You Had it Coming, Beck expands upon the electronic treatments of Who Else? to deliver a set of songs that mate synthetic beats with a harder rock sound. Throughout the album, Beck is playing dots on a chaotic sonic landscape of looped beats, samples, synths and other flourishes. &quot;Roy's Toy&quot; contains a sample of a revving engine set against a beat that sounds right out of Prodigy's &quot;Diesel Power.&quot; One of the album's standout tracks is &quot;Rollin' and Tumblin',&quot; Beck's take on the Muddy Waters classic which features 22 year-old Imogen Heap on vocals. Other highlights include the set opening &quot;Earthquake,&quot; &quot;Dirty Mind,&quot; &quot;Rosebud,&quot; and the growling &quot;Left Hook.&quot; &quot;Blackbird&quot; finds Beck doing an almost ambient call-and-answer with a fine-feathered friend while the Indian melodies of &quot;Nadia&quot; briefly recall the tender balladry of his jazz-oriented albums from the `70s. Hot on the heels of Who Else?, You Had it Coming affirms the return of Jeff Beck to his rightful place in the vanguard of electric guitarists. <br />If there is one criticism I have is that the album is too short! It clocks in at just over half-an-hour, much like an old vinyl-era LP. Be that as it may, You Had it Coming is a welcome, if decidedly concise addition to the Jeff Beck canon.

B00005NI5Y|4.0|Bob Dylan follows up his 1997 collection, Time Out of Mind, with a disc that recalls his love of the blues and American roots music previously explored on such outings as the Basement Tapes. It's fitting that Dylan puts out a blues tinged disc at this point in his career. Having just celebrated his 60th birthday in May of 2001 as well as entering his 40th year as a recording artist, he has become as venerable in the rock field as some of the bluesmen that inspired the music on this album. <br />Now some of you reading this may be thinking, &quot;Bob Dylan? Why bother?&quot; Admittedly, he has been lampooned for his sometimes nasal vocal delivery and curious fashion sense. But, don't be fooled. Dylan, having just come off &quot;Time Out of Mind,&quot; his best selling album in years and an Academy Award for his song &quot;Things Have Changed&quot; is hitting his stride once more. This album only confirms that.<br />Dylan is backed by a crack band that features guitarist Charlie Sexton as well as Larry Campbell who alternates between guitar, violin, banjo, and mandolin. The players are among the best Dylan has ever worked with and really fulfill the potential of the material. Also interesting to note is the fact that Dylan opted against hiring a bunch of studio players to flesh out his tunes. If these guys sound tight it's because they are the same road band that has played some 450 shows with Dylan in the past several years.
B00005QZWJ|4.0|Upon hearing Howard Shore's soundtrack to the first installment of the Lord of the Rings, _The Fellowship of the Ring_, I felt initial disappointment.  The music seemed pleasant enough, but nothing really stood out or emblazoned itself onto my aural memory.  Then, two hours later, I watched the film.  Other than a few key scenes, I didn't notice the music at all.  Afterward I re-listened to the soundtrack...and, with some visual cues, my appreciation increased exponentially.  Then I saw the film again, and carefully observed how the music was incorporated.  My respect for the project as a whole doubled upon this second viewing.<br />The intention of the soundtrack composer *should* be to create music that intimately compliments the film to which it is attached-it should manipulate moods and establish setting without calling attention to itself; without the viewer noticing the effect.  Howard Shore has fashioned an excellent companion piece to The Fellowship of the Rings, an elegant, subtle work that flawlessly mirrors the peaks of tension and atmospheric lulls, from the Last Alliance to Rivendel to Moria to Amon Hen and all those mythic realms in between.  <br />The Celtic flutes of `Concerning Hobbits' evokes the pastoral setting of Hobbiton, while the evocative, somewhat eerie Enya vocal gives Rivendel a proper fantasy feel: beautiful and alien at the same time.  Foreboding oboes and violas hint the evil of the Ringwraiths and the treason of Sarumen; booming percussion and distant chanting augments the approaching presence of the Balrog.  Sweeping strains carry us down The Great River.  There is usually a repetition of themes in soundtracks, and the particular themes that Shore has created work well throughout.<br />As it is not so immediate or catchy as other `epic' soundtracks, The Fellowship of the Ring bears repeat listening to fully appreciate the use of sound and dramatics, and each subsequent listen is all the more rewarding therein.  Highly recommended.<br/>A note on the limited edition: though the packaging is very nice, with a leather case and thick paper for the enclosed book, I was somewhat disappointed that this particular release was not a double-disc set.  One disc collects perhaps a third or maybe half of the total music used, thus my four star rating.
B000006TRV|5.0|i just bought the cd after getting tired of not be able to the record because i never fixed my record player and...wow!<BR>i went through the whole album in one sitting and although it got me severely depressed, it was so emotional that i just had to go through some of the songs again and again.<BR>it's all here: the battle of the individual against an oppressive society, the kid against all family baggage, drugs/law, good/evil...all of society's ills are battling away at pink's walls...there are still some things which i do not understand, but...<BR>and yes, i am a freak of house/dance music and this is still totally relevant.
B000021XS0|2.0|I go to a music school. People here absolutely worship these guys, and most the guitar players in my school want to be speed shred metal guitarists like Vai and Petruci. Most of the music  in Dream Theater sounds no different from guitar exercises found on their guitar instructional videos. No heart or soul, no passion, just a constant speed contest to see how fast you can play 32nd triplet arpeggios.<br />I also never did like James LaBrie's vocals. He belongs in theater, not rock, even if it is prog rock... even Jimmy Gnecco from Ours sounds better than him.<br />It's not a terrible album, but this in no way represents the pinnacle of DT-ness that everyone seems to be saying it is. By the pinnacle, I mean a DT album that I actually care for.<br />Grade: D+

B00000AFWZ|5.0|The garage-band phenomenon is something that seems to appear in cycles in America, but never has it produced such vital, emotional, yet coherent music as came to the fore in the period covered by this collection.  It is a major injustice that most of these tunes are never heard on classic-rock and oldies stations. Although it was with good reason that a number of them never became even minor hits--many of these bands consciously adopted shticks that seem insufferable by today's standards--this set, condensed down to an 80-minute CD, absolutely kicks butt.<br /><br />Can there be any doubt that the greatest rock 'n' roll song ever is the Standells' \\"Dirty Water\\"?  It had it all--sneering vocals, the quintessential guitar lick (and harmony organ part), an overpowering beat, a great harp solo, and I'm-just-a-boy-from-the-boondocks lyrics.  Nevertheless, \\"Dirty Water\\" is merely the best of at least two dozen similar tunes on these four CDs, which makes the set brilliant.

B00004Z4WR|4.0|Before watching this movie I had heard many bad reviews about this film.  They were wrong! This is a great car movie with lots of action.  Cage gives an impressive performance as a master car thief who comes out of retirement to help save his younger brother.  The only thing he has to do is steal 50 cars in 3 days!<br />There was not much character development, but the action scenes make up for it.  This movie made me want to go outside and drive somewhere, fast.  Don't miss this gem.
B00005R5G9|5.0|I gave this DVD 5 stars as it is one of my favourite movies.<BR>But as an actual DVD release there isn't really anything special.<BR>Its just the movie I love finally put onto a DVD.  Obviously, it is great quality.  But I was dissapointed as there were no special features.  I'd still recomend buying this DVD if you enjoy the movie itself!  I really don't care what people say about this, its a classic.  And one of my favourites.
0784011176|2.0|Beautiful, pretentious movie featuring characters you can't relate to in any way. Why should we care about them? They're cartoons borne of a melodramatic imagination.<br />Full frontal nudity of Harvey Keitel proves that not everything that is disturbing is art.
B00003CX5P|4.0|In the first installment of the Star Wars saga we learn about the origins of Luke's and Leia's parents.  Their mother is Amidala, elected queen of Naboo, and their father is a slave-boy from Tattooine with a very special gift:  Not only can he already reflexively use the Force to hone his skills as a pilot with no prior Jedi training whatsoever, he is stronger in the Force than anyone else ever encountered by the Jedi.<br />There *is* a storyline here, if you care to find it.  I guess the most annoying thing about this movie is Jake Lloyd's (lack of) acting ability.  Even Natalie Portman's admittedly wooden portrayal of the Queen appears to carry some purpose;  she was very formal while carrying out her official duties, but more relaxed when out of costume.<br />I also don't see what all the objections are about in regards to alien accents.  It *makes sense* that alien races so different from one another would have different accents when speaking English.  (What do they call it in the Star Wars universe, &quot;Basic&quot;?)  And for those who believe George Lucas was being racist in his choice of accents, I'm not seeing one single solitary objection to his portraying all Imperial soldiers with British accents in episodes IV, V and VI.  Given Britain's imperial history, that could be construed as racism too or at the very least, stereotyping.<br />Furthermore, although it is possible that George Lucas made some changes to the storyline between the 1970s and now, it is important to remember that *he had the ENTIRE story written* from episode I to VI before he ever started making A New Hope.  That plot (or lack thereof) you all complain about in Episode I 'cause it looks so &quot;contrived&quot;?  It's over thirty years old.  He isn't just making this stuff up as he goes along.  He had the opportunity to finally tell the first half of the story, so that's what he's doing.<br />And finally, there *was* a point to the story of Naboo.  Two points, actually.  Number one, that's how Anakin and Amidala first meet.  Number two, that's how Senator Palpatine ends up being elected Chancellor, thereby becoming the leader of the Old Republic.  Which, if you were paying attention throughout the movie, you know he planned it that way all along.  Knowing Palpatine is also the name of the Emperor in later episodes, an intelligent person ought to be able to put two and two together.<br />So yes, I enjoyed this movie.  I can't wait to see what happens next.
0671024256|5.0|Being relatively new to Stephen King, (only Bag of Bones and Pet Sematary read thus far) I didn't know whether it would be wise to read this before building up a more intimate knowledge and feel for his work. (I dont know why i thought that, i just did. Now it seems a bit ridiculous. Why on earth should it matter??<br />Anyway...as an aspiring author (ho ho ho, the ridiculous dreams these kids have today) i found this book extrememly informative and helpful. I love the little tips he gives, and when you think about it they make a load of sense. Of course, you aren't going to agree with everything he says, very few people would. but then, he never claims this is the definitive way to do things, just how it has worked for him. So you can understand how it might across that he feels this is the &quot;correct&quot; way to do things.<br />The autobiographical segment i found a tad boring. (I'm not one for reading biographies, i much prefer a good story.) However, you definitely can't say he's had a boring life. It might have been better if he had mixed it all up, instead of splitting it into two sections. Generally, i love finding out information about &quot;the people behind the books&quot; but in this case, it didn't actually give me much to know. Alright, he's said a lot, but has he really told us anything? Certainly it was nothing i didn't already know. It was just given in a lot more detail. I'm fascinated by writers, aspiring to be one, but i have decided that if you learn too much about them, they loose their mysticality, and become more normal, and nothing special. When I'm shown that really a writer is just a normal person, they loose some of their charm in my eyes. I can no longer embellish the facts i know to create a person who seems somewhat out of this world. (You probably think im a little strange).<br />However, even though it wasn't necessarily interesting to me, it was certainly funny. He has a great sense of humour, and it shows. It was also quite moving, especially the tale of how he came to write Carrie (but again, we got a little too much info. in the UK version of Carrie he wrote a foreword which told of how he wrote it, but it did it in less detail. In this book, he gave us too much.)<br />the writing tips i shall consider invaluable, i always do when i learn something which will improve the way i write. This is a great book &quot;on writing&quot;, the snippets of info and advice are interesting even to a person who doesn't aspire to write. (My mom, who has read it since.) <br />Thank you Mr King
B00004XQ83|5.0|Go ta sleep little babe, Man of Sorrow, and so much more.<br />Who knew that the soundtrack would be so much more successful then the movie.<br />It should be a contender in this year's Oscars.<br />Did you know that it was number one for over 25 weeks on BillBoards hottest Sountracks.<br />The movie was good but the soundtrack was like Whoa. (which means good)<br />After watching the movie my boyfriend and I woke up the next morning with certain songs from the movie in our heads. So I brought the soundtrack for us the next day.<br />He loves it, of course he wouldn't let his friends know this but he's singing and dancing around our house to this soundtrack all the time.<br />Shhh don't tell anyone!!<br />Peace
B00003CX8J|5.0|This widescreen DVD takes advantage of the format to present this very good movie in an outstanding way. The eye-popping action sequences propel the plot forward at a breakneck pace. The sound quality (Dolby 5.1, surround) is exceptional and the addition of trailers, interviews, Hugh Jackman's screen test and more, adds value to an excellent production. In short, a fine DVD to add to your collection.

The Stones<BR>and the Kinks,The Who and the Yardbirds were a large influence<BR>on this album. Cream also shows in the music. Zeppelin was not<BR>the first Heavy metal band, but they set the goal for classic<BR>metal and flew over it time and again.
6304981635|5.0|It is amazing how well this film has held up over the years. The 25th Anniversary widescreen release on DVD has so many special features that they alone are worth the purchase price. Behind-the-scenes documentaries, interviews, and commentaries are joined by theatrical trailers, production notes and more. The restoration of key scenes has been handled well, and the remastered soundtrack (in Dolby Digital 5.1) makes this the only copy of the movie you will want to keep in your collection. Highly Recommended.
B00005JKQX|5.0|...maybe because there is a healthy dose of fiction injected into this movie, supposedly based on real events, about a real man. I will go on the presumption that it's mostly true, however, because, like Alicia Nash so eloquently tells her husband at the near-breaking point, &quot;I need to believe that something extraordinary is possible.&quot;<br />I think, after this movie, I do.<br />I hadn't known the story of John Nash until I saw A Beautiful Mind, and now I'd truly like to find out more about him, because he is a fascinating character. Russel Crowe plays him to perfection, once again proving that he is deserving of more than one Oscar. Whether he is talking to friends at Princeton, or relating with the imaginary people he constructed due to his schizophrenia, or goofily wooing his future wife, he is utterly John Nash. Jennifer Connelly should finally have a breakthrough in this movie - she is literally glowing. She's been fantastic in everything else I saw her in, from Dark City to Requeim for a Dream, although, until now, her full potential just hasn't been used. It's definitely utilized here! Ed Harris was perfect, as always.<br />Because I barely knew what to expect going in, I had a great experience. There was actually a point in the movie where I didn't know what was true: Nash's delusions or the people trying to convince him he WAS delusional. Ron Howard is that good, he nearly had me duped into believing in the delusion, just like Nash had. I must say his false beliefs were, at times, more fun than the true events happening around him.<br />But the movie proved me wrong. It is his struggle to overcome schizophrenia, or to at least learn to live with it, that is truly the heart of the matter. And it is more interesting than international espionage, more touching than a friendly roommate with a little niece. If what John Nash had accomplished, with the help of his wife, isn't inspirational, then I don't know what is.<br />I hope this wins all kinds of Academy awards. It deserves heaps.ademy awards. It deserves heaps.
630463949X|5.0|This dvd was exelent I dont know how people come up with the idea of it being over produced and too much back ground people. some people need to just get a life!! Some of the highlights were Lindsey Buckingham's Go Your Own Way, My Little Demond, Tusk. I did not like this version of Big Love i hated go insane and Bleed to love her. all of stevie's songs especally Gold Dust Woman and Silver Springs. I was very disapointed when Stand Back was not encluded. that is A Stevie Solo song Fleetwood mac plays my mom alway regreted going to the Dance concert but they did not play any were near us because of Mcvie was &quot;Tiered!!&quot; I've seen Stevie live 3 times in '94 (i was only 7)'98, and 2001 Trouble In Shangri-la and stand back was exelent. I love this song live and for some reason her voice sonds better and stronger in her 2001 tour.  Stevie is a great performer she has so much energy on stage unlike Christen Mcvie who is boring on stage. but her songs were all pretty good i loved Over My Head her voice has not changed a bit. Jhon Mcvie is Very boring also. I don't like him much. And i did not see his lips move once when he was singing in You MakeLoving Fun. Mick Fleetwood is very funny and intertaning he puts on a great show. but over all this was a great DVD. I suggest it to Any Fleetwood Mac/Stvie fan. i also suggest Stevie Nicks live in Red Rocks Its just as good.
B00005JKQX|5.0|This is getting to be a pattern. In Gladiator, Russell Crowe falls from being ruling general of the Roman Army to being a gladiatorial slave. In a beautiful mind, he goes from being a mathematical genius to.... something far less.<br />And then he battles back, to return to a different kind of glory.<br />This is a wonderfully directed and told story with award winning acting from not only Crowe, but also Jennifer Connelly. She could win a supporting actress award.<br />But probably the kudos go most to Ron Howard who takes an intellectual, interior story about a mathematician and brings it alive. That's much harder to do than with an action story.<br />This movie has a nice surprise in it--  nice in that it sneaks up on you. Before long, this kind of a surprise, which other films  have demonstrated in the last few years, will become a genre all its own-- maybe call it the &quot;reality&quot; surprise.<br />Well, I've tried to talk about it without ruining the story. This is a story that uses all the levels of the roller coaster. It'll take you for a nice emotional ride.<br />It was fun, the day before seeing the movie,  to read an Op-Ed piece in the NY Times written by a former Princeton student who remembered the real professor, haunting the library. It brought an extra dose of reality to this film which is based on a real life genius who was awarded the Nobel prize. S.C. Gwynne wrote, &quot;a campus character we called Purple Sneakers, a harmless middle-aged crazy man who hung around the main undergraduate library.&quot;<br />&quot;This hapless fellow, who was easily recognized by his mismatched plaid clothing and purple or red high-top sneakers, stalked and spied on students as they walked in and out of the library. He was too silly to be frightening: he would sneak about with exaggerated, mincing steps that reminded me of old Bugs Bunny cartoons, hiding behind trees and peeking out at students as though we could not see him.&quot;<br />The character arc in this film is an unusual one, beautifully portrayed. There are some delicious lessons in it on humility, on what is important, on illusions, on genius.<br />This film is about insanity. You have to wonder. If a genius can see all the possibilities, doesn't that open him to the risk of seeing edges of impossibilities? And does that put him at risk of going mad? And is it worth the risk? Ahh. Such a beautiful mind-- like a rose-- with unexpected thorns. There are many flowers that grow this way.<br />Don't miss it.film is an unusual one, beautifully portrayed.

B00000I1OZ|2.0|I was truly disappointed by this movie.  I rented it because I mistakenly thought that this was the movie that Marisa Tomei won an Oscar for as Best Actress.  After watching it all the way through, I suddenly realized that it was My Cousin Vinny that she won for.  Now, I'm as romantic as the next person, but this movie was so sappy that it was unrealistic and stupid.  Marisa Tomei's performance in this movie and her performance in My Cousin Vinny are like black and white.  In Only You, she takes off on a whim to chase after some guy named Damon Bradley, only 10 days before her wedding.  Romantic?  Sure!  But the way she plays it out is ridiculous.  Call me a cynic, but she makes herself way too vulnerable to the men she encounters in Italy.  I'm glad I saw My Cousin Vinny first because, after her performance in Only You, it would take a lot for me to see her in any other movie.
B00005QZ7U|5.0|This is my absolute favorite movie of all time. I am in love with this movie. It has great actors, fantastic music, somewhat chaotic camera work (anyone who telll you that they got dizzy must have motion sickness because it isn't that bad), and most importantly, Ewan McGregor. (He is the sexiest man on earth!!!)<br />The music for this film is all pop culture type of music. Most of it is put in some sort of medley. It actually fits in extremely well. Nicole Kidman and Ewan McGregor, though they are both normally actors, have fantastic voices. Ok, so they shoudln't become opera singers or anything, but they did great since this is their first real attempt at singing. &quot;Elephant Love Medley&quot; is hands down the best song in the movie. Then &quot;Raoxanne&quot; and &quot;COme What May&quot;.<br />The costumes in this movie are absolutely fnatastic. they made each of the 300 costumes by hand. the sets are also amazing and very intricate. Though there aren't many special effects, one of the best is that of the green absinthe fairy.<br />Now to the main point of the movie: Ewan McGregor. Although I had never really heard of him before Star Wars, he is one of my new favorite actors. He is also a fantastic singer. he is so gorgeous in this movie, especially when he sings. I have an obsession with him now and have found that he is a tremendous actor who doesn't get as much credit as he should.<br />Baz Luhrman is a great director. &quot;Strictly Ballroom&quot; and &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot; are also intriguinly different films. Though you may not like Leonardo DiCaprio (I sympathize with you), it was still a fascinating movie. I can't wait to see what he works on next; I will definitely be seeing it.<br />Overall, this is a fantastic movie. Those people who absolutely loathe it, probably just have a grudge against one of the actors or the director. Even my friends who hated it at first have now bought the soundtrack and at least like it now. Just give it a try and go into it with an open mind; don't go by the negative critics' reviews. This movie is Spectacular, Spectacular (ok that is probably used way too much by now)!
B000002UJQ|5.0|Getting interested enough in OK Computer to go out and buy it nowadays is a very rare phenomena, I would guess. With the monumental accolades that have been heeped upon it and all the press Radiohead's recent releases have been receiving, I can't imagine someone thinking a Radiohead purchase would be a very original idea. Their immense critical success is pushing them towards mainstream. However, OK Computer is as good as the critics and fans would lead you to believe. I haven't written a review in a while,  but this album is too good to ignor. The lyrics, original guitar work, Thom Yorke's vocals and the heavy atmorsphere and cohesiveness the band has created is overpowering. The album is ridiculously good and makes everyone else nowadays look like they're not even trying. Buy OK Computer, the new stuff, and see them live, and you will thank yourself that you did.
B00005JKES|4.0|The DVD collection is great EXCEPT it does not include the Pilot episode. I can't believe that it is not included. So if you expecting the whole first season forget it, the first season does not include the pilot!

B00003CXAA|3.0|I love I and II, and I like III.  That said:<br />On this DVD set, on all four movie DVDs, pressing the &quot;Top Menu&quot; button on my DVD remote makes the movie start to play.  Weird.<br />The sound quality on the second twenty minutes of II is utterly horrible; it sounds like the dialogue is being filtered through a pillow.  <br />II being on two separate disks is a minor annoyance, but it is an annoyance that seems to be used just to market this as 5 DVDs instead of 4.  <br />The &quot;clever&quot; main menu visuals include a background that freeze frames every twenty seconds or so.  <br />The dialogue in the opening scene of I seems a couple milliseconds off between the audio and video - just enough to be noticeable.<br />I am very glad I have this DVD set, but be prepared to be annoyed.  The amateurs who did the transfer for this set should find a new line of work.
B00005R23S|5.0|Elvis will always be the King, but this concert video is proof positive that Bruce Springsteen, in his fifties, is still the BOSS!  He sings and plays guitar with the intensity and energy of a man half his age.  The E-Street band members are supremely talented musicians who sound great.  The songs are finely crafted narratives, filled with colorful characters.  The biggest surprise occurs when Bruce plays piano on the song &quot;The Promise.&quot;  The biggest disappointment is seeing a snippet of the song &quot;Blood Brothers&quot; during the interview segment, but not having a complete performance of that song included elsewhere.  However, that's a minor complaint considering how great this concert DVD is.
B00003CY0V|2.0|I had really high hopes for this movie.  I like John Travolta in a number of roles, and this one certainly should be one.  The overall objective of the story was pretty good, but I was left at the end of the movie with the feeling that the movie really underachieved.<br />The overall plot of the movie was that John Travolta's group was operating in a candlestine under the management of a Senator (Sam Shepard) and that they were funding secret wars against terrorism by stealing money from US banks.  They employed a hacker (Hugh Jackman) who was a wizard at breaking encryption codes and gaining access to restricted networks.  Travolta's group goes &quot;renegade&quot; when he disobeys the Senator's order to abort the mission because the FBI is on to them.  Travolta lets the Senator know that he will not stop, and the Senator attempts to kill Travolta.  Travolta foils the assasination attempt in a very cool street shoot out, goes and murders the Senator while he is fly fishing and continues on with the mission.  <br />Sounds promising doesn't it?  <br />Unfortunetly, the movie bogs down with Jackman's attempt to rescue his daughter from a life of living with her step dad (who is a porno movie producer) and her mother (who works as an, uh, &quot;extra&quot; on the set of the films - and that is as close as I will get to that).<br />The large mistake in this movie is that they make Jackman the central figure, not Travolta, which is a huge mistake.  Jackman isn't strong enough to carry the role and is constantly overpowered by Travolta and Halle Berry, whose entire role is really confused during the movie.<br />The film does have some very spectacular special effects, and a good twist on the end, so while it underachieved, it was not unenjoyable.
0140187537|5.0|This is a frightening book, with more real horror than ten of the standard fare. By detailing one man's sliding morals, it holds up a mirror to everyone, as we all have faced similar decisions between doing what is right and doing what is convenient. And facing ourselves can be truly horrifying -- especially when<br />the collective result of everyone's decisions is clearly evident in the ethical morass of today's world, from a President trying to re-formulate the English language to the Enron financial fiasco to wide-spread cheating on exams at our military academies.<br />For this novel Steinbeck decided to remove himself from his normal California setting in favor of the East Coast. By doing so he availed himself of a milieu where tradition and 'old money' set the standards for acceptance into 'society'. Ethan Hawley is a man whose family used to be part of that 'society', but due to bad financial decisions he now finds himself clerking for an immigrant who owns the grocery store he himself used to own. With a wife quietly but constantly chiding him about her desires for a better life, to be able to hold her head up in society, and two kids constantly clamoring for more things, Ethan finds himself at a crossroads between a rigid moral code instilled in him by his aunt and grandfather, and providing a better life for those he loves.<br />Told partially in first person in spare but very effective prose, the road that Ethan spirals down is brilliantly portrayed, from his 'sermons' to the groceries, to his internal 'conversations' with his grandfather, to the seemingly chance happenings and conversations in his little town that spawns an idea and method for robbing the local bank, to his 'dropping a dime' on his immigrant boss, to his betrayal of his alcoholic friend Danny. Each action and decision proceeds logically from the previous one, each one more step down a path with no end, a path which Ethan continues to tell himself that he can abandon with no lingering aftereffects at any time.  Each point is meticulously plotted, with all the proper items set in place before the action, and the choice of time, setting, and materials is rich in irony, a sure mark of an author fully in control of his subject.<br />The ending is deliberately ambiguous. By the time I reached that point I had been so drawn into Ethan's character I found that his final decision was tremendously important to me. Each reader ultimately must draw his own conclusion about what Ethan will do, but regardless of what answer the reader reaches, no reader can remain unaffected by this book, and will find his life richer for having read it.<br />Steinbeck was one of the great American writers. His Nobel prize was richly deserved, and this book, while not as well known as his Grapes of Wrath or East of Eden, is certainly one of the reasons why, rivaling his other works in power and insightful looks at American society, just as valid today as when it was written, and peopled by a very living set of characters.ereffects at any time.  Each point is meticulously plotted, with all the proper items set in place before the action, and the choice of time, setting, and materials is rich in irony, a sure mark of an author fully in control of his subject.<br />The ending is deliberately ambiguous.

Each reader ultimately must draw his own conclusion about what Ethan will do, but regardless of what answer the reader reaches, no reader can remain unaffected by this book, and will find his life richer for having read it.<br />Steinbeck was one of the great American writers. His Nobel prize was richly deserved, and this book, while not as well known as his Grapes of Wrath or East of Eden, is certainly one of the reasons why, rivaling his other works in power and insightful looks at American society, just as valid today as when it was written, and peopled by a very living set of characters.
B00005BJ2O|5.0|If you saw the movie then you either hated it or you are now a confirmed Baz Lurman fan and you have to have the sound track.  What could be simpler?  Just buy it now and get it over with, unless you are a masochist - in which case, wallow in the pain of denying yourself for another five minutes and then order it.
0152023984|5.0|I don't want to waste your time by repeating what everyone has said about how wonderful this gem of a book is.  I would like to mention, however, that I found the hardcover edition to be superb, and well worth the couple of extra dollars it costs.  It is sturdy, beautiful, and would make a wonderful gift for any child (or adult, for that matter).

B00003CXXJ|5.0|Shrek deserves 10 stars in my book. It's a movie for all ages. Every character and every voice is played very well. It's just plan out fun. The DVD video quality is beautiful and the audio,  rather it's Dolby Digital 5.1 or DTS is stunning. It's also loaded down with features, so it's definetly worth the purchase. SHREK-10*'s.
B00005QG9J|3.0|I have been a fan of Incubus since I saw them on the Family Values Tour in 1998, I've been hooked since then.  S.C.I.E.N.C.E. is by far my favorite album by them, and Make Yourself in second.  Morning View definately shows the maturity and musical talent of Incubus, but frankly, I grew tired of it after two weeks of listening.  It lacks the change of pace that Make Yourself had, so each track lacks individuality.  If you're into radio friendly/MTV &quot;rock&quot; than this is your album, otherwise you may not want to make this purchase.  Incubus flows away from the funk-metal that made them and lean toward acoustic ballads that leave you saying &quot;that's it?&quot;.  All in all a great cd for the easy music listeners, but for those who desire more of the old Incubus sound or just the edge they once had, you may be as disappointed as I was.
B00000FZ1V|4.0|I was very excited to get this DVD version of one of my favorite old movies, but when I popped it in I found the deleted scenes extra (and one of the other extra features - can't remember which) wouldn't work, neither on my DVD player nor on my computer... ok, bad disc I thought... So I exchanged it for another which has ended up having the exact same problem.  <br />Someone mentioned having this problem in a November 29, 2001 review so I wonder if there's a &quot;bad batch&quot; out there that has some sort of corruption?<br />Otherwise, the menus are a little cheesy, but the film looks and sounds great, and I enjoyed the trivia subtitles feature while watching the movie - all sorts of new things to learn about this wonderful movie!
B00005B36H|2.0|First I must say, I love tool; they are a great band, I love their music... Except for this. Opiate, Undertow and Aenima are three incredible CDs. They open your mind into a world unlike other heavy metal bands. They were so much different from all of the other screaming and distorted guitars. They made melodic music that allowed you to be swept off of your feet and into another world of music. But this, Lateralus, it was a HUGE disappointment for me. I had been waiting for years for this to come out. But it just sounded like something they just threw together in five minutes. When I was listening to it, I was thinking where is the melody? I guess the only reason I gave it 2 stars was for a few reasons:<BR>1. The song Lateralis is much like their old stuff, it was easily the best song on the CD.<BR>2. The bridge in their hit Schism is also very much like their old stuff.<BR>3. The lyrics are excellent, as always.<BR>So, to some it up: if you want to hear some heavy metal with sum melody, buy one of their old CDs, but not this.
0790729628|5.0|This movie is now some 20 years old. On viewing it again however it is one of the reasonably rare science fiction films which have not dated. Its special affects are still impressive and the plot is totally original. <br />The story is about four Androids who travel to earth in the search of a way to prolong their lives and the police officer who hunts them down. The picture of a polluted over populated Los Angles is a back drop to a film filled with noir elements. <br />This release is different from the original cinema release in that it drops an annoying and tedious voice over and drops an artificially happy ending. The plot of the film is easy to pick up and the inclusion of the original voice over was due to film executives underestimating the intelligence of the viewing public. <br />The chase towards the end is one of the most gripping sequences in any film let alone a science fiction film. This is deservedly a classic.
B000002UZU|3.0|I do not say this lightly: This release has the best John Lee Hooker music--and thus some of the best blues--I've ever heard, period. <br />Unfortunately, in a bizarre quest for \\"authenticity,\\" the original producers of this release tossed in a lot of studio chatter between tracks. The chatter dilutes the power and the glory of this music and is a total waste of time for all people except \\"true believers,\\" so I give this collection three stars instead of the five that it rightly deserves.<br />Instead, I must reluctantly recommend that beginners start elsewhere (\\"Very Best,\\" which includes \\"Burning Hell\\" from this collection, or \\"Legendary Modern Recordings....<br />On the other hand, if you have heard some John Lee and are ready to get baptized, this collection is among the truly essential. All of the pieces of the Hooker puzzle snap together--Hooker's barbed-wire blues & raspy vocals, superb studio values, a set of musicians who know how to back him better than any other band I've heard, and totally visceral performances to boot...
B000002AGY|5.0|Much of what I would have said is contained in prior reviews, however, I would add that I, too, own virtually all other efforts by the incomparable Mr. Hall and consider the Concierto de Aranjuez to be his finest moment.  His work with Ron Carter, Paul Desmond and Bill Evans ranks nearly as high, but this is the best IMHO.<br />This album is the only place I know of where Hall and Desmond came together with Chet Baker.  Jim Hall's guitar chops are awesome even when he is NOT in the forefront.  Listen to the way he flatters other soloists, especially encouraging and supporting Baker on &quot;Two's Blues&quot;.  His sense of time and rhythm, his sense of how much he can come into another's space, his ear for what the others are doing is exquisite.  <br />As an amateur guitarist, I have always wanted to sound like JH on this album.  I tried backstage one day to get Mr. Hall to talk about it, to tell me how.  He smiled and put his hand on my shoulder.  &quot;Just keep listening,&quot; he said.  Jim, that's what I'm doing.
0385505833|2.0|So I apparently was not the only one to find those comments about Blair's Peruvian doctor disturbing.  What a relief it must have been to those good Wonderbread suburbanites to find out that he wasn't that dark!  I was given this book as a good-natured gift and despite my usual distaste for John Grisham read it with an open mind and actually found it funny and alarming at first--if you've ever made a choice, however trivial and absurd, that goes against the mindless sheeplike impulse of the mainstream (like deciding not to have children or own a television set or drink heavily at social affairs) you will appreciate the plot's initial thrust: the attempts to force the Kranks to conform, the expressions of envy and resentment at their different choices, and the accusations of &quot;selfishness&quot; (not to mention the standard &quot;But think of the chillldrunnn!&quot;  line of reasoning).  But after the major twist it becomes disappointingly maudlin, sentimental, and predictable as the main characters are taken back into the fold of assimilation.  I really had little sympathy with the main characters--they were too shallow and unpleasant to be properly subversive, actually.  However, I give this book two stars instead of one because it did possess some slight redeeming value...it persuaded me categorically that I should never, never, never move to the suburbs of Chicago, or those of any metropolitan center, for that matter.  A city Christmas for me, where no one bats an eye if I don't put a cheap tacky plastic snowman on my roof or miscegenate wantonly with a loved one on the other end of the color spectrum.
B00003CXCQ|5.0|Honest! You'll be amazed at how much material is on these two DVDs. Take a look at the table of contents above...unbelievable! I started watching this at four in the afternoon and by eleven at night I was STILL watching! There's just so much! The color and clarity has been digitally enhanced for maximum viewing pleasure; it looks like an entirely new film. The magic mirror speaks to you with wisecracks and is a joy all around! You know the plot; you know the characters; but now you'll know the entire history behind the film, the characters, the original layouts for the Dwarfs, Snow White, the wicked queen, the witch, the dwarfs' cottage, (actually seeing the original, completely different drawings for Snow White and the Dwarfs is WAY cool) and much, MUCH more. Buy it for yourself AND for your kids! I have a feeling when this DVD runs it's course, it'll never be released with this much detail again. Get it!
6305128952|5.0|Excellent story, slow at first, but the actors were great specially Kristin Scott Thomas and Robert Redford.  A movie that makes sense, a wholesome movie to watch, no unnecessary trash in it.
B00005QJDG|4.0|This is a great live album, as far as live albums go, and this one is in most aspects much better than Once In A Livetime.  The sound quality is impeccable, for one, the mix is great, and I don't think James LaBrie has ever sounded better, except at an actual show, which is really the best way to experience DT live - accept no substitutes.<br />However, for a Dream Theater fan, it may also be a bit uneventful in terms of material they decided to put on this album.  The whole first CD and a couple of tracks from the second CD are all from Scenes From a Memory, which is the biggest disappointment.  In my opinion, SFaM was a great studio recording, and is best kept that way.  The hypnotherapist is atrocious, and Mike Portnoy's singing could use some help.  This album also lacks some older material; I would have liked to hear several songs from When Dream and Day Unite, for example.  That said, the Petrucci/Thompson solo track sounds beautiful, and the live rendition of Home leaves little more to be desired.<br />However, the second and third CDs do contain some interesting offerings, such as a Liquid Tension Experiment number and Jordan Rudess's keyboard solo.  On the third CD, we encounter, as part of A Mind Beside Itself, a version of Silent Man that is quite different from the one on the Awake album, after which comes a beautiful rendition of Learning to Live and the full Change of Seasons.<br />I'd also like to note that the band tries to add variations in their live performances, I guess to keep old songs fresh, but I view the reggae grooves in old songs and popular themes as instrument showcases instead of the fills heard on the studio versions more spontaneous than anything else, and these do little to keep the audience's attention.<br />Nonetheless, 4 stars for the beautiful production, performance, and the choice of material.
B00003CX5P|5.0|This movie is great with excellent special effects and SOME of the best sword fighting sequences that I have seen in the movies.  Yes it isn't as great as the first ones but what sequel's or prequel's do.  The deleted scenes are completed and look good unlike some other DVD's .  I think most people were expected the greatest movie of all time and what movie can possibly live up to that kind of hype.
B00005QDW5|4.0|I'm a Floyd beginner, and almost took this CD back after I bought it. There's only a few tracks I like and skipping around to them isn't fun. But it grew on me, somewhat anyway. It seems every time I get some solitude though and pop it in I find something more. Still, I think this stuff is more relevant to fans through the ages, and they'll already have most of it. For beginners, I guess we should just start with the albums.
B00005QZWI|5.0|First off, I have to disagree that you believe that Shore is imitating John Williams score. Perhaps Pablo has not heard of a composer named Carl Orff?? Don't give Williams too much credit, that is where Williams borrowed most of his ideas for Duel of the fates. And Shore is no exception. I just wanted to point out that Shore did not imitate from Williams. As for the score, I think it's fantastic. It captured the essence of the presentation that Jackson was trying to make. A knife in the dark, black rider all excellent songs for the movie. Just listening to it automatically makes me think of the Nazgul and how their scare factor seems to increase with the power of Shore's music. Emotional scenes in the movie were perfected as well because of the pace and vision shore has for this film.
B00004XONN|5.0|I wrote a review a few months ago about this album. I wrote it before i really gave the album a chance. It sounded so different from thier 1st three albums i almost had to force myself to listen to it. So i did.  THis album is great. The sounds and textures put together with Thoms angelic voice is soothing and haunting. Now i find i listen to this cd more than any of the others. And it has to be my 2nd favorite radiohead cd. (After The Bends) So if your a radiohead fan who hated this 1st time you heard it...give it another try...itll grow on u.
B00005JKT8|5.0|Meg Ryan, as usual is adorable in this movie, and Hugh Jackman is utterly irrestible. &quot;Kate &amp; Leopold&quot; is filled with funny, cute, sexy, feel-good moments. each character does a fantastic job at becoming real and making you beleive they are real. I recomend it for anyone. Because anyone and everyone in their right mind likes Meg Ryan, and if you don't Hugh Jackman is fantasic in this movie. I would give this more more stars if i could. go see it, you will fall in love with Kate and Leopold.
B00005JKMO|4.0|This biopic features a bravura performance from star Will Smith.  He literally becomes Ali, proving that the actor is a force of which Hollywood should reckon.<br />Jamie Foxx is also remarkable as &quot;Bundini&quot; Brown and Jon Voight is magnificent as Howard Cosell.  If the Oscar board is wise, both thespians should be up for &quot;Best Supporting&quot; nods.<br />The oh-so-familiar story has its lapses but the brilliant cinematography, scoring, and direction by Michael Mann make this one of the highlights of 2001.
0425107469|5.0|This book has been part of my life for the last 14 years ever since it was published.  I have found no other that even comes close to exploring the emotions shown in this novel.  The characters are vivid and the way they interact with each other.  It also goes into great detail the horrors and joys life bring and that no matter how evil and horrible a person or creature can be, it shows that compassion and pity and a sense of goodness can shine through.  This is the one book that I wish I could see adapted to a full length motion picture(it was adapted horribly), with all the characters and the complete story.  I highly recomend this book to anyone who is a fan of the surreal and the possibilies that are encompassed in todays advancing technnologies.  Dean Koontz has written a novel of such a terrifying possibility and one of great compassion.  This is his best.
B00005QZ7U|5.0|I felt compelled to review this, to let everyone know that this dvd is really worth every cent.  It is chock full of extras within its two disc set.  Not only a beautiful display, this dvd has hours of extra footage. Ranging from deleted scenes, interviews upon interviews with both director and actors, to music clips and the complete dances that were shortened for the movie. <br />Moulin Rouge was a great movie of 2001, a musical, comedy and drama all wrapped into one film.  The actors did a wonderful job, as did the writers and directors.  The film is so visually stunning, and with all the wonderful extras, there is no reason not to buy this dvd.
B00003CXXI|5.0|Aloha ~ ~<br />  We really enjoyd this movies, it was better than I expected.  We were surprized however, to find that it was a VHS and not a DVD which I thought I ordered
0783211856|4.0|This movie is amazing, I had never seen such a brilliant movie, the cinematography is awesome, and the story is beautiful, is not that sad movie where a hero comes at the end at saves the day, no, it is great, the story of Oscar Schindler and how Spielberg caught the holocaust on film is brilliant, why did he waste his time with Jurassic Park, Schindler's List is his best, Schindler's List and Saving Private Ryan are his best, both are different yet equal in one thing, they are both wonderful, not the theme their are based, but how that theme was put on film, amazing, I thought Spielberg was just a blockbuster film director who didn't really did smart movies, or endearing films, and since his credits were Jaws, E.T, Jurassic Park, Poltergeist, and so on, sure some were good, but not really mind-blowing as Schindler's List or Saving Private Ryan, in all his movies he showed he had more to offer but was not permitted to, or had not received the film project correct for him, maybe Close Encounters of the Third Kind and The Empire of the Sun were the closest ones, but when he did Schindler's List, I was surprised. And the movie, well, is brilliant, I can't describe it, just watch it and you'll see. The only problem is that is not on DVD, why, this film deserves to be on DVD, it is awesome, just imagine the movie in one disc, digitally remastered, in widescreen, what a thrill that would be, not to enjoy the killing but the message behind it, the hope, the fight of the Jewish people to survive, how great that would be. Plus, I would include some great special features, trailers, talent files, photo albums, a great box for the discs, documentaries of the holocaust, of Schindler, of the Jewish people, featurettes of how the film was made, commentaries by Spielberg, John Williams and Itzhak Perlman, the music masters the scored this movie wonderfully, by the way the score is beautiful, just hear the sample of the theme by Itzhak Perlman and you'll see. But back to the DVD, you know, Spielberg should come out with a great Collectors Special Ultimate Edition for Schindler's List, people want it, and although this film was not has successful in the box-office like all his other popcorn movies, it sure beats each and every one of them, plus, it won plenty of Oscars, with good reason, thank God the Academy did not ignore Schindler's List as they did with Saving Private Ryan by not giving it best picture, but that is another thing, the point is that Schindler's List should be on DVD, and with a great edition, not like the ones Paramount does, no, and since The Empire of the Sun has been just released, why stop there, do the same for Schindler's List, I'm sure many people will want to buy this great masterpiece, I am not Jewish, but this film touched me, along with the soundtrack, which is also a must have, so please, if you have seen it and loved it like I did, subscribe your e-mail to be informed when will it come out, since by doing this, Amazon will inform the producers how many people are waiting the film to come out on DVD, I'll sure wait, but I hope not for long. I give it 4 Stars because is not on DVD, the movie deserves more than 5 stars.
B00003CX9E|5.0|I have just been going through the poor reviews of this film, and I would like to respond.  <br />(1) If you approach this film as the greatest movie of all time, you are bound to be disappointed.  With expectations that high, what film could possibly match up?  Expectations are everything.  I try very hard to be noncommittal when recommending a movie I love to my friends so that they can approach it with limited expectations.<br />(2) The film is 60 years old.  If you dislike black-and-white, or are unwilling to make some adjustments for older styles of acting, etc., it's not for you.<br />(3) I don't think it's a very lovable film.  It is simply not the kind of old movie that sweeps us away emotionally like, say, Casablanca.  We watch these characters from outside; we're not really invited to empathize with them much.<BR>It's not surprising that those reviewers who cite Gone With the Wind as the greatest American movie, with all its romance and emotion, are outraged that the AFI selected Kane over it.<br />(4) We all have our favorite movies.  Saying one movie is the \\"best\\" is a silly sort of game anyway.  I'd bet that most of the 5-star reviewers could name movies that are as much or more a personal favorite than Kane.... I can not think of a movie that I think is superior to Kane in craftsmanship.<br />(5) Yes, Kane does take concentration and alertness to follow.  One of the key motifs is a jigsaw puzzle, and the film is definitely constructed that way.  To those who love it, the intricate structure is a source of endless enjoyment.  But if you just want to kick back and let the movie do all your work for you, this is not the film.<br />To sum up, I first saw this movie several years ago, with extremely high expectations, and felt let down.  I received the excellent DVD for a Christmas present.  I approached the movie with lukewarm expectations based on my previous experience and was totally knocked out!  It truly is a brilliant film, but try to approach it asjust another movie.  Forget all the \\"best American movie\\"... If you are the sort of person who is able to appreciate a 60-year-old, black-and-white movie that is emotionally cool but artistically stimulating, you're in for a treat!
B00004SYWZ|5.0|This is A-ha's best!  Every song on it is worth listening to.  Although, stores aren't carrying this album because lack of promotion.  The only way to get this new one is to order off line, but it is very worth it.
078324228X|1.0|I can't believe all these reviews I see gushing all over Denzel's performance in this film...so he was a boxer who got caught red-handed, boo-hoo.  Anyone could play that role.  Denzel Washington is an overacting clod who grandstands about the racial injustices in this country at any opportunity he's given.  Denzel needs to wake up and realize that if it weren't for the opportunities this &quot;racist&quot; country has provided for him, he wouldn't be a hotshot Hollywood star making millions off his movies.<br />If you want to talk about gross injustices in this country, you need go no further than the fact that Denzel's movies have brought in so much money.  Will Smith as &quot;Ali&quot; knocks this third-rate, preachy piece of fluff flat out on the mat 10 rounds out of 10 any day of the week.
B00005NI5Y|2.0|Honestly, I love Time Out Of Mind, but this CD just sounds like outtakes from those great sessions.  No original ground being broke here.  Better to invest in Live 1966 or some earlier Bob.  Or how about some of Bob's earlier contemporaries, like Richard and Mimi Farina?
B00004XQP4|3.0|Its pretty good but not Green Day. Lets say you've never heard Green Day and you buy Warning. You will say, &quot;I like this, why don't I buy some earlier stuff&quot; Then, once you listen to Dookie or Nimrod or Insomniac, you will be blown away at how much better it is then Warning. Basically, Warning is much slower than any other Green Day. The songs aren't that bad but extremely repetitive. Add that to their slowish tempo, and they all seem to drag on for years... The verses seeming to go on forever and the choruses drilling into your skull.<BR>The only exception is Minority, the only song that really sounds like old Green Day. Its upbeat, loud, fast, short but not too short. Warning is worth 3 stars, but I expect a lot more than that from Green Day.
B00005V1Y0|5.0|This is one of my favorite movies to watch on a rainy day. Pre-dating Muriel's Wedding as the irreverent Aussie comedy for all, this film is truly entertaining. It is full of humor and also has a wonderful romantic side that avoids being too sappy. Five stars!
B00003CXTG|5.0|I'm not one of those teenyboppers who liked the movie only because of Ben Affleck and Josh Hartnett. Don't get me wrong , they're good actors and all but I'm NOT obsessed. This movie was sad. It was also great too. But many people gave it a bad review. I don't understand that.
B00003XACV|5.0|Beautiful, poetic, touching, unique, innovative, vivid... I can't say enough good things about this gorgeous score.
B000003TAB|5.0|Incesticide reminds me of Bleach. It has the same raw feel. The songs though, are much better and sound more experienced. The first half has the more radio-friendly songs(not that they are at all) and the second half has a lot of screaming. From Dive, you know that this is not going to be Nevermind. Its a good buy if you like Nirvana a lot and can tolerate a lot of screaming songs. If you like Bleach or In Utero, you will probably like it. If you've just heard Nevermind and liked it, you can't really predict it. It takes a little while to get into it. Give it a chance. Once you do, its hard to get sick of...probably the hardest.
B00005JKMO|3.0|ALI is the tribute to the now almost-recluse Muhammad, starring Will Smith in his undeniably best screen performance ever. The film spans the period from 1964, when Ali took the heavyweight boxing crown from Sonny Liston, to 1974 when he won it back from George Foreman. In between, Muhammad engineers a name change (from Cassius Clay), runs through a couple of wives, contests a draft evasion conviction with the U.S. Justice Department all the way to the Supreme Court, becomes pals with Howard Cosell, has an on and off relationship with Elijah Muhammad and the Nation of Islam, and loudly proclaims himself as The Greatest to whomever will listen. All of these events are part of the public record.<br />Ali is arguably the greatest heavyweight boxer the United States has produced. He was loud and obnoxious, but he did (and still does) have class. Unfortunately, his great career, and the Champ himself, are shortchanged by ALI. Rather than being a seamless visual and dramatic narrative, the film is a series of snapshots disjointedly strung together with too much emphasis on some people and events, and not enough on others. This film is badly in need of some serious editing. As examples, Malcolm X and much of the Zaire pre-Rumble sojourn should have been left on the cutting room floor (or, in this age of digital editing, in the computer's Recycle Bin). Moreover, the screenwriters didn't take the time to sufficiently introduce the audience to some of the characters, and at several points I mentally asked, \\"Who are those people?\\" And, in a bigger lapse, those same screenwriters don't allow us a perception of Ali the man that goes much deeper than his surface bombast and popular charisma. I'm left knowing (and caring) more about the fictional character of Stallone's Rocky Balboa than the real-life Ali. (Honey, you haven't given my ROCKY  I, II, III, and IV tapes to Goodwill, have you? I want to see them all again.)<br />Despite its major flaws, the film does incorporate two acting performances of note. First of all, there's Smith's. While it may not be good enough to merit this year's Academy Award for Best Male Actor, Will should justifiably be nominated at least, and this performance is his best to date. Also, Jon Voight's Howard Cosell perfectly captures the man that those of us of a certain age remember and love (or hate). In a single year, Voight has played both Cosell and FDR (in PEARL HARBOR). For an actor, I suppose the roles don't get much better than those.ting performances of note. First of all, there's Smith's.

B000002J09|5.0|Led Zeppelin.... say it... breathe in, breathe out... Kinda makes you feel good doesn't it? Wow! Lemme start with black dog. This song starts with some odd noises, then Plant's immaculate howl. I look forward to that howl everyday! Can anyone get tired of that &quot;Hey hey mama said the way you move.&quot; line? It's just incredible. Moving on to Rock and Roll.. a very good good- natured rock and roll song.. gotta love it. Stairway, what can you say, the greatest rock song ever written, masterfully crafted, perfect. Misty Mountain Hop is just a great song, one of my favorites, it really makes you move. Going to California has a strange feel to it, but it's addictive, and When the Levee Breaks is just a great way to close out the album.. Happy Listening, this is a wonderful CD!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
0316779237|4.0|Sort of a cross between an anti-Christmas card and a greatest hits package, Holidays On Ice makes a great introduction to Sedaris' biting wit or a reminder of why you loved him to begin with.<br />Of course, the centerpiece here is &quot;The Santaland Diaries&quot;, the hilarious retelling of working at Macy's as an elf to the boorish and overbearing parents and spoiled children who come to visit Santa.  Sedaris always seems to me to be blasting both the elite and corporate worlds at the same time he looks down his nose at those that he perceives as lower on the ladder than himself.  But, all's fair in satire, right?<br />Three of the stories are printed here for the first time (three came from his first two collections), and the best is undoubtedly &quot;Based Upon A True Story&quot;, in which a television producer attempts to bribe a church congregation to pressure a fellow parishioner to sign over her story to his network for a mini-series.  The woman in question had surgically transplanted a kidney to her dying son with only a Bible, a barn, and rudimentary cutting instruments.  Although the story is both funny and tasteless, Sedaris' opinions are scathing and clear.<br />This collection is so appealing because all of the fat has been trimmed away and we're left with a short collection of holiday themed stories from one of America's angriest satirists.  If this hooks you, Sedaris' longer collections are just waiting for you to be horrified by them (and I mean that in the best possible way).
B00004X0ER|5.0|You can't truly understand how good these guys are until you've seen them on stage... I saw them live in Hultsfred ( a swedish rockfestival) before I heard their album... I have hardly seen anything that powerful or better on stage... Howlin' Pelle owns the stage... you think the album's great? wait until you've seen them perform... you'll end up loving them...
0553573403|5.0|Okay, since so many other people have made some long and wonderful reviews, I'm going to keep mine fairly brief. In short, AGOT is an absolutely wondrous read. It's different from some other fantasy books I've read in that it has very little of what I'd call &quot;magic&quot;, and is written from a more humanistic approach. Character development is about as good as it gets, and Martin sticks with each character in their own chapters, never diverting from their personalities.<br />If you like reading a book that is imaginative, intriguing and will keep you guessing through 700+ pages, this is the one. There are some adult themes in the book as well, so it's obviously not intended for younger readers. Some of the plots may be a bit complex, but they're tied together very nicely.<br />I'm only through the first two books, but I NEED to buy the third now!<br />If you're into fantasy, get this book! If you want a really good comparison for if you'll like it or not: if you're a Star Wars fan and love Ep. 5 (Empire Strikes Back), this is the book for you!
B00003CX8J|2.0|Ok, I'm the first to admit that I'm not the biggest X-Men fan ever to walk the face of the Earth, and therefore I cannot really claim to know everything about the history of the characters in this movie. I do have a basic knowledge of the characters involved, however, and I can tell who the \\"good guys\\" are and who the \\"bad guys\\" are.<br />That being said, what gives with these \\"good guys\\"? Sure, they look cool and all. But most of the movie consisted of the \\"good guys\\" sitting around, wringing their hands, going \\"Oh no! What can we do?!?\\" and not *doing* anything as a result! I expected to see some tremendous butt-kicking, but that didn't happen -- EVEN at the final apocalypic scene at the Statue of Liberty! Even there all we see is the good guys going, \\"They're too strong! All hope is lost!\\" until suddenly, and rather inexplicably, the momentum shifts.<br />I found this movie to be disappointing. Heck, \\"Charlie's Angels 2000\\" did a better job of taking old-style kitsch and making it entertaining, even if that plot and acting were remarkably weak.
0446608955|5.0|I thought this book was incredible.  It was such a moving experience, and it really made the small-town life seem real.  You begin to feel the feelings of the characters, and think the thoughts, and understand what they were going through.  It was amazing.  Really.  I'm not just saying that.  I hope the movie will be as heart-touching.
B0000042MY|4.0|I really loved the movie.  The first time I saw it I was on the airplane coming from France and thought the music was really beautiful.  Some songs on the cd seem to be the same thing.  Sometimes it feels like the same song is playing like 3 times.  But other than that I loved it.
B00003CXXJ|5.0|This movie is gut-busting funny.  I dig the soundtrack -- off-beat modern and classic rock-n-roll. Joan Jett rocks.
020161622X|5.0|This book was definitely written by people who<BR>like what they do and like doing it really good.<BR>If you are such a person who happens to have anything<BR>with making of software then I'd sicerely suggest<BR>you to read it.<BR>For me ,the book serves as a reminder of things that<BR>has been hidden under the dust of the daily life.
6305013578|4.0|Having never seen this film before, I'm not going to disagree with the conventional wisdom that there are better prints out there (i.e. Moroder).  However, this DVD version is completely watchable and I felt it was well worth my while to buy it.  The story itself is excellent, and the film is a classic.  If you ditched your VCR and really want a copy of Metropolis, I wouldn't be afraid to spend a few bucks on the DVD.  Have a couple of drinks and watch it with some friends -- you'll have fun with it.
B000002NIX|5.0|I got this CD because I liked &quot;My Own Summer(Shove It),&quot; hoping the rest of the CD would be as good, and I was right!!  <br />My Own Summer(Shove It)---(15/15)Great song!!!!<br />Lhabia---(14/15)Not as good, but worth while.<br />Mascara---(15/15)A unique, excelent song. As good as &quot;My Own Summer(Shove It).&quot;<br />Around The Fur---(15/15)This song is veeeeery interesting...<br />Rickets---(15/15)A great agressive nu-metalish song.<br />Be Quiet And Drive(Far Away)---(15/15)A good relaxing song.<br />Lotion---(15/15)The opposite of Track 6, but still a grrrrr8 song.<br />Dai The Flu---(10/15)Not too good. Just not too good<br />Headup---(15/15)Great song!!!<br />MX---(12/15)Good riffs, but the lyrics get on my nerves(...)
B00005BCNC|5.0|On screen alone for a long time, with little conversation and less background music, only Tom Hanks could pull it off.  The story line is an old one - lost on a &quot;desert&quot; island and left to his own resources.  How he handles his limited resources, including his own sanity, is the meat of this film.  It is sensitive, at times stressful, and a feather in Tom Hanks' cap.  You will find yourself looking fondly on FedEx and volleyballs.
B000000WA4|5.0|This is the best pumpkins album I have ever heard. There is a mix of everything the pumpkins can ever do.<BR>My favorite song off the whole list is &quot;tonight,tonight&quot;.I like almost all of the songs,but this one is so inspirational.&quot;1979&quot; is an excellent one ,too; The sound is amazing !<br />This is one group that I will never forget,and one album that I will never forget,either. It is just so awesome !  Ever since the first time I heard the songs, I fell in love with the band.Too bad they had to break-up-they made MUSIC !
0452282152|2.0|This book was a 1 day read and other than giving a new way of looking at art it did not delve deep enough into the charachters. It would on the other hand be great for 12 year old girls.
0452281881|5.0|This book was one of the funniest I've read in a long time.  A friend of mine who is also in advertising (as am I) recommended it to me, and I was pretty skeptical at first.  I had never heard about of it and neither had many other people.  But as soon as I had read it, I couldn't believe that more people didn't know about it!  I would honestly recommend it to anyone - whether or not you work in the advertising industry.<br />The e-mail format makes the book a very easy but enjoyable read.  It also makes it incredibly addictive, right from the get go!  The author never comes out and describes the characters or settings, but after reading a couple of one-line emails, you know exactly what is going on!  I found it really interesting how there would be several emails from different people all talking about the same episode but each giving a different perspective!  Make sure you pay attention to the cc and bcc lists too, since these provide additional laughs  :D<br />&quot;e&quot; was hilarious, addictive, smart, but different from anything I've ever read before.  What more could you ask for?!  I can only hope that Beaumont decides to write a &quot;part 2&quot; for it!
B00001U0DP|4.0|What can I say about this movie that hasn't been said before? Of course it's one of the best movies of the last twenty or so years. It's one of my favorite movies, and definitely should have been in the running for best picture. <br />Why the 4 stars, then? Because, as much as I love the movie, the DVD really isn't anything special. There's a dubbed and a captioned version, a few commercials, and a trailer. That's about it. Unless you only own a DVD player, just purchase the VHS version and save yourself some money!
6303431038|5.0|This is an all-time favorite of mine...a MUST see for any western movie fan!
B00005OWIU|5.0|A great album from a great movie! John Williams star wars/ holler type music creates the right mood that Harry Potter and the Philosopher's stone needed to make the movie seem just like the Rowling's books. From the fast-paced rhythmic \\"Quidditch match\\" to the hauntingly beautiful \\"harp rhythms\\", this album is one that all HP and holler fans should have. Though quite different from William's normal Star War type themes, the enchanting work he did on the Prologue and on various other themes is soothing and at the same time powerful. A powerful work of Wizardry art is how I would describe this album!
B00005U122|5.0|I have been waiting years for a Pink floyd, or branch of (i.e. Pulse), DVD to come out and this was just what i needed.  Though more would be nice.  Somehow members affiliated with Pink Floyd always deliver flawless performances.  This show was great, Waters is only the begining, the rest of the band is spectacular.  BUY THIS DVD!!
B00005OWEG|3.0|The original Apocalypse Now was a darkly themed masterpiece about the horrors of war and the battle for ones sanity.  It is also a masterpiece directed by one of the greatest directors of all time.  With that being said, after seeing the new version I couldn't help feel that Coppola should have left it alone.  It's not that it's a bad movie, per se, but it just didn't click for me as much as the original.  The added scenes seemed to disrupt the flow of the movie and sent it off into lighter territory.<BR>     The original movie was extremly focused and intense and the additional scenes took away from that aspect.  The extended Killgore scenes established his character to a greater extent but made Willard out to be buddys with the crew.  Part of the genious of the original is the tension between Willard and the crew, and it is all but lost here.  And the parts where they do get under each others skin seems forced and altogether not geniune.  <BR>     The playboy bunnies scene seems alittle far out and is pretty poorly acted.  The scenes with the french people living in the jungle seemed horrendously out of place and really disrupted the flow of the movie.  <BR>    But saying that, it's still Apocalypse Now, and it's still a visual stunning and mostly well acted movie.  <BR>   The other gripe I have is the DVD itself.  This has rush job written all over it with nothing but the trailor as a special feature.  I think i'll hold of until Paramount decides to put out a decent DVD.  How about one with both cuts of the film, alternate takes, the academy awarding winning making of documentary, some comentary, interviews with the cast members and so and so forth.  <BR>  So one star off for the new scenes, and one star off for the dvd.  I can't in good conscious give this classic less than three stars.
B00005AXEL|5.0|I couldn't wait to get this when I heard Stevie came out with a new CD.  I didn't know what to expect since it has been so long.  Her signature sound is still there and still enchanting as always.  Combine it with equally cool music and producers, and you get a great CD!  The only one I sometimes skip is &quot;Too Far from Texas&quot;, Stevie's voice and Natalie Maines' voice just don't blend well to my ears at times.  But in contrast, she and Sheryl Crow make awesome music together.  Buy it!
B00003CXSP|1.0|This is a movie you'll wish you'd never seen.<BR>I would not recommend this film to anyone!!   <BR>More suspense and a lot less gratuitous graphic violence would have made this a good movie. Except toward the end, where was the interaction between Clarice Starling and Hannibal?  Where was the suspense? It would have been more suspenseful if Clarice had gone to Italy on her own (after getting in trouble at the FBI for botching that drug bust) and tracked down Hannibal, and then there could have been more of a question of whether or not Hannibal would have hurt Clarice. <BR>     Anthony Hopkins gives a good performance with the script that he was given, but he was much more spookier in the first film; maybe because his hideous crimes were mostly left up to the viewer's imagination.  Certainly the crimes Hannibal Lecter commits in this film are frightening, but the gore is gratuitous-ESPECIALLY the brain scene at the dinner table toward the end of the film.  That level of gore seemed to be thrown in for Hannibal the cannibal fans, and lowered this film to the level of disappointment that it is. <BR>The very very end, how they closed the scene, ( I don't know what you call it) the screen gets smaller and smaller into a circle and ends up on Hannibal's eye before going to a black screen-THAT was laughable.  That was like the ending in a cartoon.  It didn't fit because this was not a funny movie.  <BR>There were so many things that could have been fixed in this movie to make it a better-there's too many to count! Jodie Foster made a great career move in dumping this script.  Good for her! <BR>Don't waste your money on this film!!!
B00005OM4N|4.0|Britney is defenitly one of the most popular pop sansations of this year and years to come. In this cd, her voice and song writing has changed dramatically which is good. It's nice for her to share her life with people through music and this cd really tells it how it is. It's all Britney every time you listen to it. This cd is by far my Britney cd. To some it shows maturity, but to some it just shows Britney. These songs are worth listening to, so try it!
0783117388|5.0|I bought \\"Sex...\\" one and two at the same time, to catch up on all I'd missed previously. I'd never seen these episodes, having started watching during season 3, and I was curious about the history between Carrie and Big, as well as having a thirst for a new fix of this great HBO original program.<br /><br />I was surprised that the very first show (pilot) was pretty weak, but that is the ONLY episode I wasn't crazy about. Getting to know Carrie, Miranda, Charlotte, and Samantha from the start is great fun. As the first season goes on, we really get to know the four distinct and seperate characters with their common problem, finding a normal man in the Big Apple.<br /><br />I really find this show very entertaining, and am very happy with my two \\"Sex...\\" sets. If you've never seen the show, or started late like I did, here's a chance to catch up on what you've missed. I'm sorry I didn't tape season three, but I'm wising up and taping all the shows now, new and repeat, when aired.<br /><br />For the single lady who is searching for her prince, or for the married lady like me who has been lucky enough to find hers, at some point you'll relate to this show, or at the very least, you'll be entertained.

Let's face facts though, most WON'T want to get in touch with their \\"feminine side.\\" That said, the married woman will probably enjoy this as a solo viewing pleasure.  However, I think that women who are single, will love the show, and feel like...\\"Hey, it's not me, it's YOU\\" toward their relationships, and about the whole single and dating experience in general.<br /><br />Either way, every time you pop it in the VCR, it's a girls night out in the safety of your own home.

B00005O5JV|5.0|Alrite, this movie just plain rocks! =) It's one of those feel-good movies that also makes you laugh all the way through. Reese Witherspoon delivers a powerhouse performance as Elle Woods, a ditzy yet lovable blonde who has, for her entire life, never been regarded as the \\"serious\\" type. Nobody has ever seen her that way, and that has never bothered Elle before, but it really gets to her when her cocky boyfriend Warner dumps her for that very reason and heads off to Harvard Law School. Thinking that she might still have a chance of winning back Warner's heart,  Elle also decides to enroll. Her remarkable imput on things gradually brings her to the head of her class, but throughout most of the movie, love is the one thing she's after. In an attempt to find a \\"serious\\" girlfriend, Vivian is Warner's top choice. This girl is serious, all right, and she's Elle's biggest competition. While working on her studies and striving to get Warner back, Elle helps her insecure manicurist find love and works on an important trial case which profiles Brooke Taylor--Elle's biggest fan--suspected guilty of murder. With her evident charm and intelligence, Elle proves herself worthy of being taken seriously, and by the time the movie is over, all you can do is admire her for everything she's done. Reese Witherspoon played the part perfectly, and I can't imagine anyone playing this designated role with more energy and spunk. This is one of those movies that's so bright and funny, it's almost impossible not to like it. Do yourself a favor and watch this movie. It's perfect, no matter what mood you're in. If you need a movie that's gonna lift your spirits and make you laugh, \\"Legally Blonde\\" is the one!
0783225849|5.0|Never before - or since - have direction,screenplay,score and<BR>casting converged so perfectly.<br />My favorite scene : Janet Leigh stops car at pedestrian crossing<BR>as she is escaping with stolen money and is glared at by her boss<BR>crossing the street(after telling him she would be home sick).<BR>Notice how other movies (Pulp Fiction) have used this.
B000002AGE|4.0|&quot;Heavy Weather&quot; was Weather Report's most famous album, just because of the small hit &quot;Birdland.&quot; But it's one of WR's most well-balanced, and one of the greatest arranged electric albums ever. Keep in mind it still is jazz, because there is soloing often. But it's in the heavily arranged category. WR started heading in the TOTALLY arranged category on their next one. That's why I say this:Get everything WR did before this, and as for after, try &quot;8:30&quot; or &quot;Night Passage&quot;. Those are as good as they got after &quot;Heavy,&quot; and those are 2-3 star albums AT BEST. But back to &quot;Heavy Weather,&quot; Jaco was now the fulltime bassist, and his fretless bass was becoming the third lead voice, and he was becoming the third main composer. In fact Jaco's compostitions are as good as anything on the album by Joe or Wayne. Besides from Jaco, Joe now had 6000 lbs of synths, and they are starting to get a little annoying. This would be a 5 star record for the compostitions, arranging, performances, but the synths detract a little from parts of the journey that IS &quot;Heavy Weather.&quot; Oh well, on with my song reviews!<br />-Birdland-I know it's not &quot;cool&quot; to like beautifully arranged, catchy songs that are extremely memorable if you're a &quot;true&quot; jazz fan, but all you asleep out there secretly hope Anthony Braxton would hit a melody like that in &quot;piece 99938.53&quot; or whatever. This song is brilliantly written out. Jaco's bass is amazing and there are passages that still make me cry with excitement.<br />-A Remark You Made-Nice little ballad by Zawinul, some cool soloing from Wayne's tenor. But the bass melody always sounds like &quot;that's what friends are for&quot;. Oh well, it's still pleasant enough.<br />-Teen Town-Here we go. Jaco wrote it. Jaco plays the painfully exciting, and fast melody. And Jaco plays drums on it. The problem is:it's too short.<br />-Harlequin-Wayne wrote this. It's a great composition, I'd wish he'd play the melody on his sax instead of Joe playing it on his synth.<br />-Rumba Mama-Yeah it's pretty cool, but why bother putting a minute long subpar percussion solo on this album. I have a video of the concert this was taken from and they should of left it unedited. It has some incredible moments.<br />-Palladium-A Shorter latin-funk this is perhaps a highlight of this album.<br />-The Juggler-Very underrated track in the vain of &quot;Jungle Book&quot; on &quot;Mysterious Traveller.&quot; Zawinul plays some cool instruments over an interesting drum track.<br />-Havona-This was the Jaco moment equivalent to Napolean crowing himself emperor. I'd edit out the synth opening straight out of the movie &quot;Tron&quot;, and you'd have a complex, shimmering masterpiece with an improv by Jaco that will make your head spin.<br />All in all-This is the place to start. Of course it would make Wynton Marsalles vomit, but thats a GOOD thing. People categorize art to often. &quot;It's too jazzy&quot; or &quot;It's Not REAL jazz&quot;<br />What &quot;Heavy Weather&quot; is, along with most everything else WR did, it's MUSIC. AND GREAT MUSIC IT IS. I hear jazz, i hear funk, i hear latin, i hear jungle, i hear rock n' roll, but most of all MUSIC. This is a collection of styles. A FUSION is you will.

B00005U122|5.0|This disc ranks with the best there is on DVD. Audio and video production are as good as anything out today. I own over 30 live concert DVDs and this show is at the top of the list. If you have a Dolby Digital audio system, this is one of the best shows you'll see-- period.
B00004Z4SD|5.0|I wonder if David Lynch was drawn to directing this film if only because of the possible title.  But, the film lives up to its title, a feat that Lynch familiars should be interested in.  <br />The film is a very simple (true) tale of Alvin Straight, who learns that his brother - who he hasn't spoken to in years - has had an illness fall upon him and decides to go and see him.  So, he hops on a riding lawnmower and off he goes.  This idea could have easily turned into a silly mess, but throughout, the film is handled with care and sentiment (not sentimentality).  <br />It has a measured pace, so the restless beware.  But if you have no problem with the pace of The Sweet Hereafter or Breaking The Waves, this shouldn't be a problem.  Lynch explores the rural countryside of America with conscience, it's like a love letter to his Heartland Of America roots.  <br />The plot would be pointless to specifically recount because it would just reveal incidents that happen on Alvin's journey.  For the entire film Alvin travels and meets with various people, who are each - in different ways - touched by his presence.  We also meet Alvin's daughter, who is interesting, and we learn about one or two of her problems.  We learn some of Alvin's past by his tellings with others who he meets.<br />The score is delicate, alomost mournful, played mostly on a violin.<br />Without trying to sound too pretentious, The Straight Story may be Lynch's most personal film.  It is so unlike David Lynch, that it makes me think it is more David Lynch than anything he's done before.  And for Lynch, this  G rated film is probably his most experimental.
0812550706|5.0|This is a truely wonderful book. It follows a young boy, Andrew Wiggin, nicknamed Ender throught his tough times in the Battle School. He was a &quot;Third&quot; in the family, meaning a rare third child birthed by parents, allowed by the government because His brother and sister weren't accepted for his tedious deed. He is taken into outer space for training in a Battle School to fight an alien race, whom they dubbed the Buggers. In the Battle School, they make realistic fights seem like games for training. He becomes an expert at all the games, and even beats an &quot;unbeatable&quot; video game. He makes many friends and enemies along the way, and at a very young age, surpasses his older counterparts. They know he is the only hope for the world, but can this young boy handle the task of the genocide of a full alien race?
B00005OM4N|5.0|Before I heard this album, I will admit that I was not the largest Briney fan.  However, when  encouraged to listen to it by a friend from school, I have realized that she really isn't all that bad.  In fact, this album really grew on me.  So much so that I found myself listening to it very often.  In my opinion, Britney's new cd has a very different sound from her past albums.  Although it's still pop, it's more &quot;grown up&quot; and highly entertaining.  I like it because there are not very many slow songs. The songs are face-paced and easy to dance to.  I would recommend it to fans of pop music everywhere.
B000003S2O|3.0|Classic Eno Ambient.  Obscure, fuzzy, hidden behind layers of acoustic fog and quasi-natural ostinato.  Particularly good is track 4, &quot;Shadow.&quot;  I won't spoil the surprise at who is &quot;singing&quot; on that track; you will have to read the credits.
6305662371|4.0|The Exorcist on DVD has been given a deluxe treatment that should surely please the fans.  Packed in a nice golden box and featuring lobby cards, a collectible booklet and more, it's a very feature-packed DVD expierience.  <br />First off, The Exorcist isn't quite as great of a film as some folks may tell.  I don't know why, but it just didn't scare me a bit.  Still, you've gotta respect it for making its way to top 100 films and winning a best picture award (very rare for a horror film) as well as scaring the pants off of a generation of movie-goers.  It also features very fine actors.  Ellen Burstyn is quite talented and she played the role of Chris MacNeil very well.  Jason Miller is quite good as a preist, Father Karras.  Lee J. Cobb does very well with the small part of Lt. Kinderman and, of course, who could forget about Linda Blair?  This extremely talented young actress (who had only had a small part on one movie before) does so well as the possesed child, Reagan, spouting out profanity and doing extremely violent and disgusting things (although her voice was dubbed over by Mercedes McCambridge).  <br />I think we all know the plot of The Exorcist, so I'll just talk about this limited eition collector's set.  It's quite pleasing.  Packed up with behind-the-scenes footage and all sorts of things, it's the ultimate Exorcist goody bag!  First off, this film looks great and sounds great.  Considering the movie's age, the transfer is quite mind-blowing.  Sure, it's got its fair-share of scratches, pops, and glitches, but it's an overall very well done re-master.  The sound is very good and you can almost always hear what the actors are saying (not near the beggining, but little Linda's words of possesion come off loud and clear).  All in all, I can hear what I'm supposed to hear.  <br />This DVD is double-sided disk, one side containing the movie and one containing the special features.  The main highlight of the extras must be the 76 minute documentary called &quot;The Fear Of God:  The Making Of The Exorcist&quot; that goes quite in-dept to give us all the information on the making of The Exorcist.  It contains interveiws with actors Jason Miller, Linda Blair, Max von Sydow, Ellen Burstyn, Rev. William O' Malley, Rev. Tom Birmingham, and several members of the cast and crew, including William Peter Blatty and William Freidkan, who takes the film much to seriously (here's a direct quote: &quot;The is not a film about Dracula!  This is not a film about the alien!  This is a film about people who live up the street!  It's about a real street in a real town, with real people living in it!  And in this real house on the third floor is a real little girl who happens to be possesed by a demon!&quot;  William Freidkan) and seems to think he's some sort of a god because he made this movie.  Still, this documentary is consistently entertaining, always informative, and it opens the door to all sorts of unrevealed materials.  In reality, Mr. Freidkan was more of a psychotic freak monster than a director.  He beat up Ellen Burstyn (giving her a permenent spinal cord injury as well as not caring a bit about the fact that Linda Blair was dieing during filming of one scene.  What a psycho!  This documentary also contains several deleted scenes (which can be seen in context of the film on The Exorcist- The Version You've Never Seen).  The deleted scenes include a much different (and much better) ending that doesn't end on such a depressing note and gives way to The Exorcist 3.  You can also see a short scene extension between preists Merrin and Karras on the staircase and the famous &quot;Spiderwalk&quot; sequence, which is quite chilling and should never have been cut out in the first place.  Interviews between William Peter Blatty and Freidkan are quite hilarious, as neither person is listening to each other.  Freidkan seems more interested in his coffee than Blatty's talk about the deleted scenes.  <br />The documentary seems like enough extra, but there's still more stuff!  There are all three original theatrical trailers (incredibly cheesy) and one for Exorcist 2 The Heretic (which is a treat) and several TV Spots and a detailed description of the story the Exorcist is based upon (the description sounds just like the movie, but without a girl).  There's also two commentary tracks.  One of them is by William Freidkan that's enjoyable, but they don't even bother to lower the film's soundtrack, so he's quite hard to hear.  However, the stuff he does say is quite interesting.  The other one is by William Peter Blatty who talks-and talks- and talks!  Then, the second half of the commentary is sound tests, which are quite dull.  Other extras include trailers for &quot;Beetleguice&quot; and a few other Warner movies, as well as an introduction at the beggining of the movie by Freidkan.  I've noticed that he sais four times in different places this:  &quot;Everyone takes out of the film what they bring to it&quot;, which is cr*p.  He says this in his introduction, his commentary, his commentary for the new version, and in the documentary.  Anyway, the introduction is quite good and should spike interest in seeing the movie.<br />So, all in all, this DVD Box-Set should please fans of the movie, who I'm sure will proudly display it on their shelfs.<br />If you found my reveiw helpful, please vote for me.  Thanks a lot!
630469654X|4.0|This is a funny, creepy, magical romance with truly hideous title graphics, music that will make you giggle at inappropriate times, fakey medieval costumes, and bad hair days - like a cross between Midsummer Night's Dream and The Highlander. A very sweet movie with good performances. Mood elevating and fun for the whole family with a solid core idea that makes it a fantasy classic.
B000007ODL|4.0|I received The Very Best of JJ Cale as a Christmas gift, and listened to it in it's entirety the first day I had it. I never realized how many JJ Cale songs Eric Clapton covered.<br />This CD is fantastic.
B0000027RL|5.0|Like a man clawing his way from underground, and just seeing the first rays of precious sunlight, Eddie Vedder sings; 'IIII, OOHH, I'm Still Alive'! in such an impassioned, soulful wail, you feel more alive and liberated just listening to him.<br />While Pearl Jam would only get better on thier second album, this seminal release is top notch in every possible way.<br />From the first notes of the pummeling opener &quot;Once&quot;, and Vedder's first anguished cry, &quot;IIIIII Admit it!&quot;, to the walloping, shifting arrangement, we, the happy listener, are taken on an emotional joyride. You all know the hits, &quot;Evenflow&quot;, &quot;Jeremy&quot;, &quot;Black&quot; and &quot;Oceans&quot;, but the entire album has an impressive consistency that thrills me no matter how many times I've heard it. Keep in mind, this band had only been together for a few months when this LP was hastily recorded, but the way they gelled in such a short time makes this music that much more astounding! &quot;TEN&quot; is a great rock record that just sounds better with time.
B000002LOE|2.0|This album was REM's smash hit, but to me it represents a real low point in creativity (aside from the disastrous Monster, the terribly boring Up, and the commercial and critical flop Reveal, that is).<br />Track by track:<br />1.  Radio Song -- a collaboration with rapper KRS-One that is just plain embarrassing.  It was then; it's even more so now.  The less said about this one, the better.<br />2.  Losing My Religion -- I can't even stand the first few notes of this song anymore.  I immediately switch to another radio station if it comes on.  &quot;That's me in the corner...that's me in the spot....light....&quot;  Arrgggh....that's me switching you OFF, Stipey.  And much was made of Pete Buck's mandolin playing at the beginning and end of the song, in which he learned to play, oh, about 5 notes.  Whoopee.<br />3.  Low -- Extremely ponderous, boring song with a non-existent melody.  It doesn't even come close to matching the quality of the B-sides on Dead Letter Office, let alone passing muster as an album track.<br />4.  Near Wild Heaven -- Fluffy pop, courtesy of Mike Mills on lead vocal.  Somewhat pleasant, but like cotton candy with no real substance.  Goes on too long also...gets repetitive.<br />5.  Endgame -- A failed instrumental.  Let's just put it this way:  REM is no Pet Sounds-era Beach Boys, though they tried to be on this track.<br />6.  Shiny Happy People -- consistently voted by the members of rec.music.rem as the most embarrasing song the band ever recorded.  (Of course, this was before Up and Reveal came out.)<br />7.  Belong -- This one I like, though it goes on too long.  Abstract lyrics, a powerful beat, Pete Buck is actually making good use of his guitar (something that is sorely missing on much of the album), and transcendent harmony on the wordless chorus.  Nice one.<br />8.  Half A World Away -- filler.  Stipey in his &quot;aching ballad&quot; mode. You've heard this one before, and done better.<br />9.  Texarkana -- another tune in whichMike Mills takes lead vocal.  Mills has a puny little voice, but it works fine on this song.  Too repetitive, though.  Once you've heard the main verse and chorus and the &quot;Catch me if I fall&quot; line about, oh, a gazillion times, you've had enough.<br />10.  Country Feedback -- Ugh.  Whiny, wheezy, lousy melody, boring, slow, (insert more derogatory adjectives here).<br />11.  Me In Honey -- About the best song on the album.  Driving guitar riff, powerful Bill Berry drumming, great chorus.  Kate Pierson of the B-52s livens this one up.<br />A classic album?  Not even close.  Check out the first four REM albums, plus the Chronic Town EP, for that.
B00004XQ83|5.0|Saw the movie, loved the music; although this is generally not my cup of tea I felt moved to buy the soundtrack and enjoy it quite frequently.
B00005NVT1|5.0|If you like Daft Punk, this is an excellent cd. You dont get a Daft Card with it, but you do get stickers. It consists of 5 songs seamlessly combined on one 45 minute track. It's cool... trust me.
0060977493|1.0|Yes, its silly pseudo-poetic surface makes it uninteresting and unreadable (I lasted about five pages before tossing it) but the book shouldn't be avoided solely because of the author's vehement criticism of American foreign policy that she expressed elsewhere. Why not just have a good old-fashioned book burning in this once Land of the Free.
B00003CXTF|5.0|Many people would compare Pearl Harbor to  1997's Titanic. Mainly this is because much like Titanic, the movie is focused on a group (or couple) of people dealing with a tragedy that really effect hundreds - to thousands.<br />    Pearl Harbor did a better job at focusing on how Pearl Harbor effected others than Titanic. The first video (out of the duo) is mainly focused on Danny, Reeve, and a nurse. My dad sat and watched it and was feeling a bit annoyed how the writer's could just throw out the feelings other people had to deal with during the war, but all that changed when he watched the second half of the movie.<br />    The second half of the movie is mostly about war. They show many Navy fighters shooting Japs planes and trying to escape the target of torpedos: their ships! You feel the emotions of all the  sailors while trying to save each others lives, especially a young black man who works in the kitchen who has to box to earn respect. You see the termoil in the hospitals. Many wounded and near-dead fighters filling the little space they have.<br />    Yes, I'm a teenage girl. Yes, I agree Josh Hartnett and Ben Afflak look pretty darn good in this movie, but I didn't like the movie because of that. I loved it because it left me in tears as I saw first-hand of the terror of Pearl Harbor. I never really heard of Pearl Harbor in history class until the movie came out, and it was just so overwhelming.<br />    Overall, this is an excellent - but long movie. I do not recommend this movie to people who love happy-movies and despise sad ones.
B000053VAF|5.0|Stunning isn't a word usually assiociated with Kevin Smith films, but that was exactly what I thought the first timne I saw this one.  Dogma takes a complicated, and often very touchy, subject and turns it into a simultainiously hilarious and thought-provoking film.  To call this movie bible bashing or anti-god is naive.  Kevin Smith has managed to present all the doubts, inconsistencies, and tragically hilarious aspects related with organized religion, speaking to a generation in a way very few have even tried.  If anything, Dogma has brought me closer to an understanding and acceptance of god, not driven me away.  The idea that it is faith, not belief or religion, that matters, is comforting, and not too forced in Dogma.<br />Now, on DVD specifics, this is exactly what every DVD strives to be.  It has a plentitude (hehehe, I said plentitude) of extras, all of which are well-presented and thankfully not just advertisements for the movie.  The commentary and the over two hours of deleted scenes are the  most-used features on mine.  I personally would have bought it just to hear Ben Affleck and Kevin Smith dissing Matt Dammon's acting skills, and to see Jay and Bob performing the theme from Fat Albert.
B000003337|5.0|Okay if your a hard core randy fan this is one of the cds you need in your collection .The cd is a must and is very straight out see where all the coolist licks came from when randy was with ozzy its all here and if you like to play guitar plug it in and jam with cd you will love it . The licks are tremendous to not try . If you do not have it buy it know and jam your heart out as Randy blows them all away . As one of the best guitar players that every lived this one will burn your fingures to the bone .Buy it know what you waiting for .
B00005R87Q|5.0|I'd go as far as a 10 for this pic. You can't sit still during this movie. If you're a racing fan you can't go wrong here. The racin' is exuberating and &quot;Wish you there&quot; thoughts. I left this movie ready to race. Ready for the thrill.  The story isn't all just about racin' either. There is a point to it but can't give that away. This differs from &quot;Driven&quot; w/Stallone in that this is street racin' &amp; Driven is Indy racin'. The soundtrack in the movie is awesome but the actual soundtrack release is disappointing. Best when viewed on a big/wide screen with a good sound system. I can watch this over &amp; over and have been patient for its release.
B00003CXXI|5.0|THIS MOVIE WAS GREAT AND IS A GREAT LESSON TO ALL, CHILDREN AND ADULTS. MY 3 YEAR OLD SAW THAT BEAUTY IS INSIDE AND NOT JUST SKIN DEEP. WONDERFUL MOVIE FOR THE ENTIRE FAMILY. A MUST WATCH AND BUY FOR MY FAMILY.
B00003CXAA|4.0|I never watched any part of the series. I heard about the famous horse head but that wa sit. Therefore it was given to me as a gift &amp; I was skeptical about liking such a collection without ever watching it before. Boy was I surprised. This is an AWESOME series. I had no idea. I'm Italian and fell in love with my ancestors all over again. Those were the days. The story line is incredible and was very disappointed that the series would end with Part 3 &amp; the death of Michael. I would like to see a 4 with Vincent C. as godfather. But why ruin a good thing right. All in all this is a great deal, get them together. And watch 1 right after the other like I did. DVD is the way to view it since you can get subtitles in case you miss something they said. Brush up on your italian too (there are subtitles though).
0451204530|2.0|Ken Follett's name still sells books and that would be the only reason to consider this book.  Peter's review below is dead-on - this is flat stuff - nothing like vintage Follett (Eye of the Needle, Key to Rebecca, Lie Down with Lions etc were very good).<br />Either he has lost that touch or this is a rush job or ...<br />The only reason to give it 2 stars is that it maintained the minimum interest necessary for me to complete it(not a very long book.  A name other than Ken Follett and this would get a 1-star!<br />Very very mediocre - character development is minimal as is the &quot;plot&quot; - if one can call it that.  Do yourself a favor and give this one a wide berth.
B000005H4K|5.0|...if you even find yourself this far into the exploration of jazz music, then you already are somebody who knows a lil somethin about what a beautiful thang this jungle-music stuff already is.  you already know the reputations of the art-masters performing here...so the only real question you should be askin yourself is &quot;why havent i already added this to my shoppin cart?&quot;  not convinced?  imagine a basketball team with kareem, dr. j and jordan.  a football team with montana, emmit smith and chris carter.  imagine if michael jackson, elvis presley and madonna got together to make an album...okay, that's just dumb...but are you gettin what i'm tryin to say?!?!  this is an excellent jazz album.  once you've read up on it, or sampled some of it's songs, then there is no reason not to break down and get this....unless you jus wandered here by mistake because you was lookin for a brittany spears or lil bow wow cd...and even if you did:  buy this anyway and enjoy it!

B00005JKES|4.0|I LOVED THIS SERIES WHEN IT CAME OUT ON TELEVISION. I LIKE DAVID LYNCH'S STYLE. THE MORE BIZZARE, THE BETTER. I KEPT WAITING FOR THE &quot;TWIN PEAKS&quot; SERIES TO COME OUT ON DVD. THIS X-MAS, I RECEIVED IT AS A GIFT. I COULDN'T WAIT TO RELIVE THE TOWN AND ALL THE CHARACTERS WHICH DREW ME TO THIS DARK SERIES IN THE FIRST PLACE. IT HAS BEEN YEARS SINCE I HAVE SEEN IT AND MY ONLY DISSAPOINTMENT WAS :WHERE IS THE PILOT EPISODE????? FOR SOMEONE WHO HAS NOT SEEN THE PILOT AND THEY SPEND THE MONEY FOR THIS SET. THEY WILL BE LOST.....I HAVE SEEN THE PILOT AND WAS EXCITED TO START THIS WHOLE SERIES OVER AGAIN YEARS LATER. NOT INCLUDING THE PILOT WAS A HORRIBLE DECISION. I CAN'T EVEN FIND IT TO BUY IT. DOES ANYONE KNOW IF IT IS OUT THERE FOR SALE ON DVD? OTHER THAN THAT- I AM ANTICIPATING THE SECOND SEASON..MY FAVORITE THING ABOUT THESE EPISODES IS HOW DARK AND SOMETIMES FRIGTENING EACH EPISODE ENDS.....
6300183971|1.0|I can sum up my critique of DUNE with a mere three words: don't watch it.<br />There are a number of marvelous things in this movie, but they are few enough to count, and each positive is ridiculously topped by a host of failures.  Francesca Annis, Sian Phillips, Sting, and Linda Hunt are at worst interesting, at best quite good; the rest of the huge cast, with Kyle MacLachlan a case in point, is about as exciting as trailer park garage sale furniture.  The art designs are interesting; the special effects, however, are ludicrously bad beyond all description.  But the core problem is the script.<br />The novel is largely unfilmable, and unless you've actually read it (and I recommend it; it is an extraordinary work) you'll never be able to discern what is supposed to be going on.  And &quot;supposed to be going on&quot; is a key phrase, for the very little that could be successfully transferred from the book actually was.  If you're masochistic enough to actually want to sit through this extremely long, ponderous, self-important, and largely unintelligible movie, do yourself a favor and either catch it on the late-late show or rent it from your favorite video store when they have a dollar-day.  At least that way you won't kick yourself for having wasted too much money.
B00005JKT8|4.0|&quot;Kate and Leopold&quot; is not a masterpiece, but gets the job done.  A story about lovers meeting across time is not particularly original. However, this film works because of the chemistry between Hugh Jackman and Meg Ryan.  They hold it together in spite of its obvious flaws.  Liev Schreiber as the bumbling time traveler who brings them together gives a solid performance.<br />My advice is not too take the movie too seriously, but simply enjoy it for what it is.  It is unapologetically escapist entertainment, and doesn't pretend to offer any answers to the existential mysteries of the universe. Does it deserve any Academy Ward nominations?  No, but it will likely bring a warm smile to your face.  &quot;Kate and Leopold&quot; is a good way for you and your significant other to enjoy an evening.  It deserves four stars.
B00005QZ7U|5.0|I walked into the movie theater not knowing what to expect. And I walked out heartbroken ! I regret that I only saw it once in the theatre ! I rented it on video a few days ago-and it rarely left the VCR ! I also bought the Cd because I couldn't get the songs out of my head ! I have to tell you I was really impressed the first time, but I was blown away when I saw it again ! First, I have to say that the love story was incredible and heartbreaking. I could not believe the energy of the movie, but I think it's just what it needed, anything less would have been criminal ! I also was blown away(understatment here=) by Ewan and Nicole's voices ! I get goosebumps whenever I listen to the cd ! I also have to say the acting was...um, how should I put it ?...two of the finast performances(NOT kidding)I have ever seen and probably will ever see. Everything, from the music, acting, directing, cinematography, costumes, dancing, EVERYTHING works in this movie !!! It reminds me of what cinema can be like at its finast, and it makes me want more movies like it !!! I KNOW that I will be rooting for this movie to win on ocsar night !!! Moulin Rouge IS the best movie of the year, and is easily one of the best ever made !!!
6304698658|5.0|What I would like to know is WHERE CAN I GET THE ORIGINAL, CHRISTMAS VACATION ON DVD. The one currently sold is missing a number of scenes? <br />Please let me know, Thank you, it might not even be possible.
B00000ILDE|5.0|One of my theories is that sequels are never as good as the original.  Well, \\"Aliens\\" proved it wrong!  James Cameron's 1986 sci-fi/action classic surpasses the original \\"Alien\\" by far, although the two cannot be compared.  Why?  Here goes: Ridley Scott's 1979 original was more of a horror film, rather than Cameron's sequel, which focuses more on action.  And, boy, does it have action.  <BR>The story is simple: after 57 in hyper-sleep, Ripley (Sigorney Weaver, who earned an Oscar-nomination) is rescued from floating adrift in space by a team of scientists.  Ripley is the only survivor of the first alien encounter, and is the only living human who knows of the alien's existance.  Of course, her hazy employers of the Company don't believe her tale, because a colony has been thriving on LV-426 (the planet where we first encountered the alien) for years, and the people living there have never complained about anything.  Considered a nutcase, Ripley is fired and is forced to live in isolation.  <BR>And then, trouble arises!  Apparently, \\"all contact has been lost with the colony on LV-426,\\" and sleazy Company executive Burke (Paul Riser) convinces Ripley to return to LV-426 to check it out.  Oh, yeah, she'll be traveling along with a squad of space marines.  <BR>When they reach their destination, everyone in the colonty is, of course, dead--except little Newt (Carrie Henn), a child who has maraculously survived the alien's wrath.  And it seems that the colony's processing station is being used by the aliens as a nest.  In the first big action scene of the film, nearly all the marines are killed when they march into the alien nest, which ends in a fiasco.  There's not just one alien . . . there's a whole colony!  It is Ripley's worst nightmare.  <BR>Along with mothering Newt, falling in love with a marine (Michael Biehn), and battling those nasty critters, Ripley makes a startling discovery: sleazy Burke was planning all along to capture an alien specimen for the Company's Bio-Weapons Division (shades of Ash from the first film).  And Ripley is determined to stop him.<BR>By the film end, only a handful of our heroes survive.  I must admit that going in, I wasn't expecting a good movie, but Cameron proved me wrong . . . again.  <BR>\\"Aliens\\" boats amazing special effects, along with James Horner's intriuging score.  Also, Weaver's acting has improved greatly since the first film, and she delivers one of her strongest performances.  And the all-female fight scene at the end is worth seeing twice.<BR>All in all, \\"Aliens\\" is a classic sci-fi/action movie, with plenty to offer in entertainment.  Thank you, Mr. Cameron.
B00005JKT8|5.0|Hugh Jackman, in what will surely be his breakout role to super-stardom, and Meg Ryan deliver marvelous performances in this tale of two people who meet and fall in love in the 21st century but whose romance is clearly better suited to the 19th. <br />More than your ordinary time-travel storyline of the confusions that result when two characters living 125 years apart clash head-on, it is the pair's emotional involvement, shaped by their respective epochs, that drives the story. Moreover, it is precisely their separate realizations that their ability to love each other is limited by their own historical periods that gives their story such poignancy.  <br />This highly-entertaining movie is satisfying on its own terms, although history buffs take note:  don't take the sets too literally or look too closely, or you will find much to quibble with, from the period costumes to the background settings.  Didn't anyone tell the film's researchers that the Brooklyn Bridge, prominently featured in both the 1876 and 2001-era  scenes, didn't open until 1883 -- and that in 1876 the bridge looked nothing like it does now.  Anyone who had seen it only at the midpoint of construction in the mid-1870s would have never recognized it in final form.
B000002GQE|5.0|1967 was the year of innovative albums: Cream (DISRAELI GEARS), Jimi Hendrix (ARE YOU EXPERIENCED), The Who (THE WHO SELL OUT), Pink Floyd (PIPER AT THE GATES OF DAWN), The Beatles (SGT. PEPPER), and honorary 1967 release PET SOUNDS from The Beach Boys.  At the end of the year, The Moody Blues (with the new Hayward/Lodge/Pinder/Thomas/Edge line-up) chipped in with this album.  This album also puts forward all the signature songstyles the members would be known for.<br />&quot;The Day Begins&quot;--Orchestral overture has bits from all the different songs.  Concludes with Mike reading one of Graeme's poems, &quot;Morning Glory&quot;<br />&quot;Dawn: Dawn is a Feeling&quot;--Mike wrote this but Justin sings most of it.  This is an introspective (a Pinder singature) song about the early day.<br />&quot;The Morning: Another Morning&quot;--written and sung by Ray, this whimsical (his trademark) almost childlike song is very hypnotic and enjoyable.<br />&quot;Lunch Break: Peak Hour&quot;--John's trademark (straightforward rock and roll) comes through in this beatdriven rocker.<br />&quot;The Afternoon:a) Tuesday Afternoon b)(Evening) Time To Get Away&quot;--a)Justin's composition was the first U.S. single and a Top Thirty hit and deservedly so.  b)John's song in this set seems to jump back and forth between slow and introspective to jumpy and upbeat.<br />&quot;Evening: a)The Sunset b)Twilight Time&quot;--more Mike introspection (a) and Ray whimsy (b) for your listening pleasure.<br />&quot;Night:  Nights in White Satin&quot;--Justin's trademark style (love ballads, usually painful) and song, the best on the album and one of the best songs in the Moody Blues' 35+ year history.  Went to #2 in the U.S.--five years later!<br />That's track for track the debut of the second Moody Blues, one of the most innovative rock and roll albums of all time.
B00004Z459|5.0|I believe the lead singer (Chester) has the most amazing voice I have ever heard.  Track #8 &quot;In the End&quot; is the best song on the CD.  Of course, the entire CD is incredible.  I have heard a lot of music and was a teenager in the mid 80's and let me tell you I have a CD to share with my teenage sister.  The lyrics will dig deep into your soul and capture every emotion.  These guys are definitely on my favorite list.  I read about them and found that they will literally stay after a concert until everyone has a chance to meet them.  Wow!!! I'm an instant fan!!!
B00003CXTF|5.0|I loved it. Josh is perfectly hot, Ben is perfectly hot, the movie is perfectly right. In addition to the stunningly perfect actors, the special effects are really realistic, and the movie is touches you really deep. The Japanese general has a conscience, and every aspect of Pearl Harbor is shown. The script is great, and the directing is perfect as well.
B00003CXTG|2.0|I found Pearl Harbor a disappointment.  I usually don't agree<br />with the critics but this time was an exception.<br />With an overly contrived love triangle with a poor script which<br />the actors are defeated by at every turn, I can't help but<br />think how superior &quot;Saving Private Ryan&quot; was to this mediocre<br />effort.<br />Granted, it is not without its merits.....CUBA GOODING's<br />performance deserves an oscar nomination.  Kudos also<br />to Jon Voight's characterization of President Roosevelt.<br />And the special effects are outstanding as well.<br />As for the rest.....you have 'soap opera' with a little<br />history thrown in.  Kate Beckinsdale's hairstyle through<br />most of the movie isn't even in keeping with the forties.<br />And the love triangle is 'stupid' and 'unbelievable'.  And<br />totally 'predictable'......I knew what was going to happen<br />the minute Ben Affleck was presumed dead....the rebound<br />romance between Hartnett and Beckinsdale with, of course, the<br />inevitable pregnancy and Hartnett's phony death.  Sheeesh!<br />I can watch &quot;As the World Turns&quot; or &quot;Days of Our Lives&quot; every<br />day....I don't need it at a movie.  In my opinion, this is<br />what ruined an otherwise well intended attempt to capture<br />one the the 20th century's most unforgettable moments.  Alas...<br />don't waste your time with this.
B00003CXTG|5.0|This movie has got it all.  Action, romance, slight comedy, adventure, awesome special effects, and great actors.  Pearl Harbor keeps you on the edge of your seat, dying to know what happens next even if you HAVE seen it before.  It makes you feel as though you really were there, fighting for the United States of America.  It is a movie that makes you want to join the army, navy, military, or air force.  You can almost feel the intense heat from the explosions, the pain from shots (yes, the medical kind), and the pressure of doing a barrel role.  And most of all, it shows you what truly did happen on December 7th, 1941.
0375703764|2.0|What a really weird book and so damn hard to read. I gave up. I only read part of the story then sold the book used. I thought the content would be more interesting and a good story. So far from it for me. Couldn't really follow all the jumble of the story, I think they just wanted to put together a &quot;cool&quot; book.
B00005OAA6|4.0|I can´t explain how much I like this cd. It fills a gap of something I was looking for. For some it may be a cheaper version of J.Lo, for me it´s more than that. Even if she´s not that big in the UK is due to the content of the cd that screams &quot;I wanna be released in the US&quot;, which I doubt it will. All it needs is time to take ehat in Europe and chart again. Poor girl can´t choose her singles and she wants to know why she fails? Choose better songs!<BR>1. Not such an innocent girl: Bizarre choice for a first single! First of all, it´s a rejected song from Willa Ford and Vic had to settle with it and release it a first single, thanks to Virgin (Her record company). Anyway, I like it, it´s not that bad, definitely a grower. It made #6 in the UK Top 75. 8/10<BR>2. A mind of its own: They did it again. This is a mid-tempo ballad with Vick´s personal lyrics but it won´t make up if it charts poorly. All I can say is that this is one of the weak tracks from the album. It´s already been tipped as a Top 5 hit, hopefully it will do better than the previous one. 8/10<BR>3. That kind of girl: Personally for me this is where the album really begins! A smooth R&amp;B track that shows a perosnal side of Vic and David. Laid back r&amp;b track with catchy chorus. 8/10<BR>4. Like that: My favorite from the album. The orchestra backing it gives sends a drama feel and the r&amp;b beats with the strong bridges and choruses make it a wicked song. This should have been, not the first but the second single hands down! I prefer it to be the second one because NSAIG was like an introduction and this might have been an excellent follow up. Think Destiny´s child mixed with J.Lo and you´ve got yourself a chart hit! Hopefully a single. 10/10<BR>5. Girlfriend: Nice at first but gets annoying because she repeats the chorus like 10 times. This one´s not for me, and what´s with the &quot;I´m cool&quot; attitude? 6/10<BR>6. Midnight fantasy: Hailed as a the &quot;It will neverbe released as a single&quot; song, MF is a Janet-type of song (Think &quot;Someone to call my lover&quot;) It´s catchy as hell and would definitely make a very good single. It´s a mix of europop with a little garage feel. Nice to sing along. 9/10<BR>7. I.O.U.: Rumors are saying this may be the third single. This is the first proper ballad in the album, but it´s not a sappy one, this one´s more up-tempo. Vick tells how she thankful is to David. It might go well, not sure really. I love the beginning of it. 9/10<BR>8. Not trix, no games: When I read the title I thought she was talking about the cereal but she´s not. This is power pop to the best. I love songs that have an attitude and there are several songs here that show it making Victoria reveal another side of her. This one is gonna be a favorite one for the girls who like to be themselves instead of faking it. 10/10<BR>9. I wish: It begins like N´sync´s &quot;Girlfriend&quot; but then turns into another in-your-face song with clever lyrics about a girl confused in a relationship. Straight up r&amp;b that should work well in the dance floor although not one of my favorites and it´s really an album filler. 8/10<BR>10. Whatchu talkin bout: Everyone is saying that this song is the highlight of the album while I find it completely average; sure, if it´s released in the US it might be a hit but it won´t work for me, this is very plain r&amp;b. 7/10<BR>11. Unconditinal love: As a review said &quot;The chorus makes your spine tingle&quot;, it was right. It´s kind of an eerie song. It´s a pop ballad but not sappy at all, quire enjoyable and check out the bridge, it´s a killer. 10/10<BR>12. Every part of me: This is where the cheese starts and thankfully it´s in the last song. It starts with Brooklyn (Vick´s son) laughing and the lyrics.....well, I can´t stand them. For me is my least favorite from all the album but when I get to this song I let it play anyway cause I know that when it ends NSAIG will play again. 6/10<br />Overall grade: 8.25/10 which means, not bad but could be better.....a lot better! She needs to work on getting a wider range of producers and explore new sounds. I don´t want her to drop her R&amp;B style but she could do without the generic beats that float around the album. You´ll love this cd I can guarantee you! For me it´s in my Top 10 of the year 2001.
B00005QDW1|4.0|With ROCK STEADY, No Doubt have successfully melded the playful attitude of TRAGIC KINGDOM with the more seriousness songwriting chops exhibited in RETURN OF SATURN to make a great dancehall album: ROCK STEADY.<br />The first single, &quot;Hey Baby,&quot; is a great precursor to the rest of the songs on the album.  If you like the great cameo by Bounty Killer on &quot;Hey Baby,&quot; you'll love the reggae-spiced &quot;Underneath It All&quot; which features Lady Saw, the woman who added her own touch to Vitamin C's &quot;Smile&quot; and made the song pleasantly bearable.  Prince also adds background vocals as well as co-writing and co-producing credits to the darker &quot;Waiting Room&quot; in which Gwen sings &quot;If desire is your only food / it can get you sick.&quot;<br />No Doubt experiment with more producers as well.  The most successful of which is William Orbit (Madonna) on &quot;Making Out&quot;: an amazingly danceable song about the anticipation of a lover's long-awaited visit.  It has a &quot;Do the Hustle&quot; feel much like Smash Mouth's new &quot;Pacific Beach Party.&quot;  Nellee Hooper (Bjork) also has luck with &quot;Hella Good,&quot; another synthed-up, bassed-up, also very danceable tune and &quot;Detective&quot; which sounds like a continuation of RETURN OF SATURN's &quot;Ex-Girlfriend.&quot;<br />No Doubt have definitely hit their stride with ROCK STEADY.  Maybe it's been Gwen's collaborations with Eve and Moby that have helped to enhance No Doubt's overall sound, and with the success of those songs, I'm sure anymore collaborations in the future will be welcome.
0785813500|5.0|Edgar Allen Poe. I'm sure you have read his most famous of works, The Pit and the Pendelum, The Tell Tale Heart, the Raven etc. But who of you has ventured deeper into his writings? There are many of his lesser known works that will keep you glued to the couch for hours. Example: The Angel of the Odd. You may think you know Poe, but.... you really don't. This book also contains an introduction that was very interesting. I know much more now, some of which I wish I didn't learn. Excellent stories, excellent poems, excellent book.
B00005QDW5|3.0|&quot;Echoes&quot; is a flawed concept because Pink Floyd's songs have always been best appreciated in context of each of their art rock albums, not as standalone singles. The 2-CD greatest hits package overcomes the built-in obstacle somewhat by making the songs blend together and creating new mixes of old Floyd standards.  So, for example, &quot;Us and Them&quot; blends into &quot;Learning to Fly&quot; with the addition of a brief musical segue, and the two versions of &quot;Shine on You Crazy Diamond&quot; from &quot;Wish You Were Here&quot; are melded into one lengthy song with no break between them (unlike the way they appear on &quot;Wish You Were Here&quot;).  This CD is a good starter kit for anyone who wants to learn about the history of the band, especially if you want to get a taste of the Syd Barrett era without having to invest in the rather questionable full-length CDs that characterized the group's work prior to &quot;Meddle.&quot;  You also get a sense of how  bitter (and, perhaps, uninspired) the group became as Roger Waters's own perspectives began to eclipse everyone else's (see &quot;The Fletcher Memorial Home&quot;).  This is not so much a greatest hits package as it is a decent documentary of the band.  By the way, purists should take note that the set contains a truncated version of the epic song &quot;Echoes.&quot;  Several minutes have been cut from the song.
0785813500|5.0|Everyone has read Poe's most famous stories and poems. The Pit and the Pendelum, The Tell Tale Heart, The Raven etc. But few ever venture deeper into his lesser know works. The fact is that there are many other stories and poems which are equally impressive. And you don't need to be a horror fan, his stories are really more of a fantasy. He describes every little niche to the finest detail. So if you love his works but think you've read them all, I would suggest you buy this book. There are many stories and poems that you've have never heard of that will stay in your memory for quite some time. Personally, I found The Angel of the Odd to be quite exquisite.
B000007MVD|5.0|This collection gives any Beatle fan a better look at how much more the group did before their american popularity.  The media always ruins the public's view by forcing us to listen to a certain selection of music.  This 2CD will show any music lover the early raw talent of the best band in history.
B00005QZ7U|5.0|Baz Luhrmann is the mad genius who brings Moulin Rouge together. The visual artistry, which at times can be overwhelming, is used very effectively to create a fantasy world in which an otherwise simple story is given a breath of freah air. <br />Although this movie is one of my favorites from 2001, it is not for everybody. The first 15-20 minutes alone are enough to give some people a headache because of the fast editing and swirling camera movement. However, those first minutes do a good job of setting the pace of the Moulin Rouge so that when the pace of the film slows down, the audience is ready for the love story.<br />Nicole Kidman is absolutely first rate as Satine, the courtesan. She has to run the gamut from tacky, silly, to crying and dying. It may take more than one viewing to truly appreciate what a well rounded performance she gives. And, she can more than hold her own in the singing department. Ewan McGregor is also very good as Christian, the poet who loves Satine. It is hard to imagine any other actor in the role. He and Kidman have a great onscreen chemistry (it's obvious from interviews they enjoyed working together). His soulful poet is at times brash and confident and at other times a scared little boy--he is the stabilizing center of the story. Oh, and he sings nice too. The supporting actors, Jim Broadbent and Richard Roxburgh play their roles to the hilt and are both very good.<br />Overall I would recommend Moulin Rouge to anyone who enjoys film as an art or anyone who likes a nice love story. You get both with Luhrmann's creative genius at the helm.
0385505833|4.0|Let me begin by saying that I grew tired of John Grisham's legal thrillers some time ago so I approached this book with skepticism. I was delightfully surprised by this book - with the most pleasing blend of comedy, drama, and yes - even real emotion. The book is a short read and one that I will reread every year.<br />  The story focuses on a married couple whose daughter has left them on their own for Christmas. Vowing to buck the tradition and ignore the holiday the couple face the hostilities of those around them who see participating in Christmas as a civic responsibility. Several twists bring the story to a place where the heart is warmed, the belly can revel in a hearty guffaw, and where the meaning of Christmas, for this family, is (re) discovered.<br />  This is not great literature nor Dickens, but it is a light-hearted Christmas story well worth your time.
0385505833|5.0|I am an avid romance and mystery reader.  This book was a total surprise.  It was definitely a comedy that I could relate to.  My husband was definitely Luther and I was Nora.  By the middle of the book, I was laughing so hard - tears were flowing down.  Everyone in the house wanted to know what was happening.  My husband and a friend have already borrowed the book and thought it was great.  It is a quick read.
6305609721|5.0|Having been in exile on the Vulcan home world because of their illegal activities in the previous film, the famous senior officers from the Starship Enterprise venture back in time on a quest for something that will save the inhabitants of Earth from their own ecological shortsightedness.  Though the script can get a little preachy at times, this is a fun film with an interesting plot and lots of good acting.  Arguably the best of the TREK flicks.
B00003CXN3|4.0|Steven Soderbergh's film about the war on drugs centers around three seperate stories somehow caught around the same enemy- drug power.  First off, there's Benicio Del Toro, a Mexican police officer battling drug related enemies across the Mexican border, visually realizing the dramatic death and cause of corruption that drugs destroy the world with.  Then there is Don Cheadle who is out to stop Catherine Zeta-Jones and her husband with their drug marketing in which Cheadle's federal officers and witnesses are being killed.  And more dramatically, we are introduced to a the highly powered Michael Douglas who is pitted against fighting the drug war that has corrupted his daughter, in which she's become a serious addict.<br />Not only is this film smart, but it mixes depressive reality with heavy drama.  This film is shot in three textures- a rustic faced picture, a deep and eerie, cold blue; and finally a modern regular picture.  These textures of picture set the tone of emotion throughout the film.  This film is powered by its performances from Benicio Del Toro, Don Cheadle, Michael Douglas, and Dennis Quaid.  This film is almost hard to watch because it is very durogatory and saddening, but it is the world today.  What helps this film is its ending which sheds light.  The ending sequence in which Del Toro watches the baseball game was a delight to see.  This film also introduces some interesting points- maybe not good- but interesting.  It opens up a new world to me.  25% of the world's teenagers and high schoolers are addicted to drugs.  It's easier for a 16 year old to buy cocaine and heroine rather than alcohol.  Street punks make five hundred dollars in two hours everyday from selling illegal drug produce, then spend the rest of their day doing whatever they please.  Murder and lies corrupt police stations and federal armies only to protect powerful drug companies.  Only 75% of the parents who's kids are on drugs will realize that they are doing it.  The worldin Traffic is mad and deleriously sickening.  This film knows drama.  It knows what the audience doesn't want to see, and it gives them it anyway, because they don't want to tone down the war, Soderbergh wants to make it as real and as simple and harsh as possible.  However difficult it seems to comprehend, the more people will open there eyes and realize that the majority of the world is in chaos.  It may not appear as though it is, but it really is.<br />Soderbergh's dramatic piece hits where it hurts and where it is impacting.  It isn't perfect though, because it seems as though we are delivered too much.  It was hard for me to hold it all in as truth.  The sad part about it is that it is truthful.<br />I guess I can say this film is terrible, but actually good at the same time.  It depends on how you look at it.  Traffic is just merely an eye opening experience that is depressing and dramatic.  I can't recommend it to anyone only because I don't agree with what it presents and I don't like it, I just understand it and it means something to me to learn what the world is actually like.<br />DRAMATIC.  SADDENING.  DUROGATORY.  IMPRESSIVE.  IMPACTING.  EYE-OPENING. ... TRAFFIC.
B00005JKHP|4.0|STAR TREK: THE MOTION PICTURE reunites the cast of the original TV series--for the first time since the show was cancelled in the late '60s--as the famous Starship Enterprise is sent to investigate an alien entity that is heading towards Earth and leaving death and destruction in its wake.<br />Basically a thinly disguised rewrite of the classic STAR TREK episode \\"The Changeling,\\" the film itself is, for most part, of interest only to die-hard TREK fans.  However, the new DVD version has been cleaned up and improved in several ways, and the package also includes a disc of extras--tidbits such as documentaries and deleted scenes--that should appeal to casual TREK fans and aficionados alike.<br />[Note: If...allowed a multiple rating system, this DVD would be recommended as a 5-star disc to die-hard Trekkers and a 4-star disc to all other viewers.  The VHS version, sans clean-up and extras, would offer only a 3-star rating to both viewing groups.]

6305910103|5.0|This entry in the TREK film series is basically a sequel to an episode of the classic STAR TREK TV series entitled &quot;Space Seed.&quot; In that episode, a group of genetically engineered supermen and superwomen are unwittingly awakened from their cryogenic deep-sleep by Captain Kirk and crew, after which a struggle for control of the Enterprise ensues.  Kirk and company emerge as victors, of course, but the genetic superfolks are allowed to live in exile on a harsh-but-habitable out-of-the-way planet.<br />In this feature-length sequel, Ricardo Montalban (of FANTASY ISLAND fame) is wonderfully over-the-top as he reprises the role of Captain Kirk's nemesis Khan Noonien Singh, leader of the aforementioned genetically superior exiles.  Having found a way off the prison planet, Khan leads his fellows on a quest to exact revenge on those who were responsible for their banishment--namely, Kirk and crew.<br />Arguably one of the best of the TREK flicks, the story is tight and exciting, the special FX are top-notch, and the acting is excellent.  (One notable performance is that of actress Kirstie Alley, who here makes her film debut as a Vulcan Starfleet officer.)  It's true that die-hard Trekkers will have fun picking apart some of the TREK continuity errors--e.g., why does Chekov recognize Kahn when the Chekov character was not yet a part of the show in the original episode?--but casual TREK fans and aficionados alike will find this entry both entertaining and &quot;genetically superior&quot; to the previous TREK film (i.e., STAR TREK: THE MOTION PICTURE).

B00004RE7C|3.0|The crew of the Starship Enterprise defies Starfleet orders and ventures to a forbidden planet in order to retrieve the resurrected Spock.  Not the best of the TREK flicks, but not bad either.  Highlights include lots of cool special FX and Christopher Lloyd's over-the-top performance as a Klingon commander.  This film is also notable for marking Leonard Nimoy's feature-length directorial debut.
6304806442|5.0|I read the book and saw the movie.  In terms of a movie based on a book, &quot;Trainspotting&quot; is an AWESOME interpretation of the book.  If you want to see a movie where the characters are clean and wholesome, don't see this movie.  If you don't want to see the main character of the movie swim in the worst toilet in Scottland, see dead babies crawl on a ceiling, and unknowingly committ statutory rape, don't see this movie.  If these don't apply to you, you will love this crazy emotional rollercoaster and the cast of characters that inhabit it.
6305350205|3.0|A Clintonian Vulcan (he feels your pain), in exile for rejecting logic and embracing emotion, commandeers the Starship Enterprise and shanghai's its famous crew in his quest to find God at the center of the galaxy.  The corniest of the TREK flicks, and the one that marks the directorial debut of star William Shatner (surely a coincidence--NOT).<br />This film has some pretty good special effects, adequate acting, and some of TREK's greatest comic moments--e.g., Scotty bellows something about knowing the ship like back of his hand, then promptly gets KO'd when he bumps into the bulkhead--but the plot is inordinately inane.  For the most part, only die-hard Trekkers will want this flick in their DVD collections.
B00005JKQX|5.0|This is absolutely one of the best films I've seen this year.  The performances from all members of the cast were wonderful and I won't be surprised to see a number of well-deserved Oscars awarded to the film.  As an economist and fan of Dr. Nash's work I was curious how his life would be presented and whether or not it would accurately portray his genius and contributions in an interesting fashion.  It was interesting, it was powerful, and I was amazed.  This movie is definitely a must see.
0767802659|5.0|This is one of the better films made in the US by the talented Dutch director Paul Verhoeven. Since he left his native country he has been treated with both honors and contempt at the box office, by the critics and audiences.<br />No wonder this film did not do as well as it should since it eschews Hollywood's usual PC treatment of ideas and characters as well as sentimentality.<BR>The norm for mourning a dead character in this film is about 30 seconds. What this film deserves is a letter writing campaign to Sony/Columbia to make a sequel!<br />The film presents a regimented future society faced with a challenge presented by an alien race whose biological superiority is a threat to the survival of humanity. By following a group of young recruits we learn more about this future society besides being treated to some masterfully directed sequences of futuristic warfare. The Music was composed by Basil Poleudoris a director turned composer who also did the musical score for Conan the Barbarian (directed by John Milius). Brilliant casting of Michael Ironside as an one armed war veteran turned teacher turned warrior once again. I also recommend this film to all Denise Richardson fans.
B00005UKKF|3.0|I watched it on HBO.  If you like pretty things.. costumes and Britney included, or if you are a huge Britney fan, then its worth buying.<BR>  I wish she would of actually sang during it instead of going through the motions though.
B000001E8S|3.0|These are tracks recorded after the ZOO TV tour.  Though most of these songs would catch anyone a little off-guard, &quot;Your Blue Room&quot; is a track that by-itself makes this album worth having for any major U2 fan.
B00005QCYC|4.0|We bought Jurassic Park on VHS several years ago, but when DVD was getting close my daughter and I decided to wait for the first two movies to come out on DVD, then we heard about a third movie and decided we'd wait until all three of them came out in a single set.  Long story short - It was worth the wait and the Beyond Jurassic Park volume is very interesting.  We're big Jurassic Park fans and have really enjoyed these great films on DVD.  It seems common to rate the movies by preference so here it goes:  Jurassic Park is still our favorite.  Its just so in-the-right-time and in-the-right-place that the spirit of thing probably cannot be repeated.  Daughter thinks The Lost World is her next favorite of the three, as for me, Jurassic Park III is my next favorite.  For me The Lost World was too much of a parade of the dinosaurs, and I really didn't believe that Mr. Spielberg had his heart in it, certainly not anywhere near what he put into Jurassic Park.  I got that feeling even before the movie was made while watching pre-release interviews with him.  He said the audience wanted to see more dinosaurs and that's what they were going to get - and indeed we did.  But let's face it, even a medium size effort by Spielberg is still awesome by any general movie making standards.  Jurassic Park III was second on my list precisely because Mr. Spielberg turned the camera lenses over to somebody who could still get into it and at least attempt to bring back some of the real magic of the first film.  Still - (true confessions here) - we watch all three of them over and over.
B00005JKMO|3.0|For a three hour movie, this movie had remarkably little content. Althought biographical, it only covered a few years of his life, not even his complete boxing career. There were many unnecessary scenes that had nothing to do with the rest of the movie. For example, there was about 20 minutes of Ali jogging (around two hours into the movie) in preparation for the famous &quot;Rumble in the Jungle&quot; fight. During these 15 -20 minutes, the only dialouge is some Africans chanting something which translated to (I think) &quot;fear Ali.&quot; This scene has no point, and I think it was just put there because they wanted to make the movie longer. There were many other examples, but that one was the worst.<br />Also, the movie was poorly directed during the boxing scenes. I often found myself wondering who was punching who. The camera angles were often poor. Also, some characters just materialized without introduction. For example, (I don't want to give away  too much) but Ali's second wife just comes out of nowhere. The audience is never told that he even got a divorce, let alone that he remarried. This happened a couple of times in the movie.<br />On the positive side, Will Smith did an excellent job, as did most of the cast. Smith captured the arrogance, and hypocritical idealogy of Ali very well. Also, that Smith was actually made to look like Muhammed Ali is a miracle of film making.<br />Overall, an OK movie marred by trying to be more epic than it was, and poor direction.
B000059QYB|5.0|Billy Idol was one of those artists that I always enjoyed listening to but never got around to purchasing any of his albums.  I remember back towards the mid-'90s wondering why this guy didn't put out a greatest hits album.  Indeed, with no new albums since, he has finally done so.  And without a doubt, this collection is just right.<br />The track order is chronological.  The version of &quot;Mony Mony&quot; included is the studio one that did not actually chart (the live version that went to # 1 is not included--but the version here got as much if not more airplay anyway).  Songs like &quot;Hot In The City&quot; and my personal favorite &quot;Eyes Without A Face&quot; sound better than ever on this remastered CD.  &quot;To Be A Lover&quot; and &quot;Cradle Of Love&quot; still rock.  Including &quot;Shock To The System&quot; was an assurance that Billy covered his entire career on this collection.  The closing remake track &quot;Don't You (Forget About Me)&quot; is excellent as well.<br />Billy Idol is a one of a kind artist with a wide variety of well-known songs.  This collection will remind anyone what an influential artist he was.  He became popular while remaining true to himself musically.  The quality of these songs speaks for itself.
B00000DLV1|5.0|Mix the essential trip hop band with a full orchestra and put them in front of a crowd and what do you get?  The definitive trip hop live performance.  The music is beautiful, haunting, and brilliant.  Beth Gibbons' voice aches and strains with emotion.  The orchestra fluently translates and enhances the downbeat Portishead tempo.  The songs on Portishead's first two CDs are wonderful, but the live versions are even better.  This CD is three years old now and I still listen to it over and over and over again.
B00003CY0V|5.0|I saw this movie with my friend and his dad. His dad is really critical about movies and stuff like that. I was very surprised to hear that he really enjoyed it. I on the other hand, heard great things about this movie from other people and was looking forward to seeing it. I was not disapointed. The movie had some great actors such as Hugh Jackman from XMEN and Don Cheadle who did an incredible job in Traffic. Now I have to admit John Travolta is someone who I do not really like as actor. That is probably because I haven't seen many of his movies. I'll tell you one thing though: He was amazing in this movie. He delivered a performance you won't forget and his character'spersonality was one that was so unique I had to question myself with his interesting being. Now comes Halle Berry. Now I also admit that I was looking forward to the scenes with Halle Berry bearing her body. But, she is an incredible actor too and she deserves credit for the good job she did in this movie. Overall, this movie was confusing in some parts but then again, most movies are. All movies have the potential of being viewed twice and then you will full understand the movie. Swordfish is a great movie with anyone interested in the world of hacking, terrorism (not the best time in the world to say that word sry), and illusions (you will understand once you see the movie HOUDINI IS MY BRO!). I highly recommend seeing this movie. After all, a great story,  with great actors, and some scenes that will make you jump, how can you miss? Hehe, just kidding.
B00005JKQX|4.0|The story of John Nash, a mathematician, &quot;Beautiful Mind&quot; contains some of the best performances I've seen in quite some time. Russel Crowe is a marvel as the troubled John Nash, and Jennifer Connely leaves a foot print in Hollywood with her performance. The film keeps you guessing as to if this guy, John, is really sick or telling the truth about his &quot;illusions&quot;.<br />At the beginning though, I didn't quite see where the film was going, and to tell you the truth it bored me a bit, but after the first twenty minutes the film starts to pick up pace throwing us a few laughs here and there. The film is structured perfectly as far as emotions go, and the over all feel of the film is heart warming and memorable. Oscar winning performaces on both Crowe's and Connelly's part, whom I'm sure will get at LEAST an Oscar nomination. Definitely one of the best films of the year!
B00003CXXI|4.0|I really enjoyed the movie, however, was disappointed that it was spoiled by some profanity.  I know my nieces and nephew would greatly enjoy it, but will not get the chance to because of the profanity.  I counted 3 profane words.  It's a shame that those same 3 words will cause lots of kids not to see this funny movie, when those 3 words added NOTHING to the plot.  I thought animated movies were supposed to be for kids.  If it weren't for the profanity, I'd have given it 5 stars because it is a riot!
B00005OWIU|5.0|I have never heard any music by John Williams before, but when I was watching the Harry Potter movie I couldn't help noticing the wonderfully composed music!  The music is so terrific that you can see the scenes from the movie when you listen to this soundtrack!  The night Harry was brought to his uncle's house, the Diagon Alley, The Great Hall, the Quidditch Match,...  they all come alive just by listening to this CD!  My favourite track is the last track, Hedwig's Theme.  It's like the entire story is told in just that one track!

I ESPECIALLY LOVE THE PIANO PLAYING ON &quot;TROUBLE&quot;. THERE ARE ONLY A COUPLE OF SONGS HERE THAT  QUALIFY AS FILLER. I REALLY HOPE THESE GUYS BLOW UP IN 02.
B00005QDW1|4.0|I'll start by saying that Rock Steady is no Tragic Kingdom.  But I doubt we will ever see a Tragic Kingdom 2.  The vibe on this cd is definately better than Return of Saturn.  However you do have to listen to this cd 3-5 times before you really appreciate it.  Some highlights of the cd are:  Hey Baby, Underneath It All, Detective, and the title cut Rock Steady.  True No Doubt fans will enjoy this cd, but if you are looking for the quirky sounds of Just a Girl or Spiderwebs I don't think you will be as impressed.
B00005J6UP|5.0|The Goonies has to be hands down, the BEST movie to ever come out of the 80's. I was only a year old when it came out in the theaters, but I saw for the first time when I was very little, and to this day I still love it! This movie has some of the funniest and best lines I have ever heard..and whats even better is watching it on DVD. It looks like new now that it has been digitally enhanced, as well as the sound being enhanced. Its also in widescreen, so you get to see what was probably cut out of the background. And as for being the un-cut version, thats even better. It sux when they play it on tv, and they leave out the &quot;Mouth en Espanol&quot; scene (one of my favorites).  The Cyndi Lauper music video in the 'Special Features' section is hilarious..it was nice to see the video in its entirety (since I never saw the whole thing, lol). Also, the outtakes feature is cool, because you get to see scenes that were originally cut out of the movie. Theres the quicky mart scene, the ever-so-talked-about octopus scene (now we know what Data means about the huge octopus at the end), a small scene with Sloth and Chunk (which they SHOULD HAVE left in, it was soooo funny!!) and theres another outtake that I am probably leaving out, but those are just a few! You can also watch the Commentary (which is kinda boring, but at least you get to see the actors all grown up). Then theres the usual foriegn language settings, and the theatrical trailer. And if you havent seen this movie before (shame on you! j/k) I hope you enjoy it!! :-)
B000002UA0|5.0|I have talked to a lot of people who love Pink Floyd's later music, but not The Piper at the Gates of Dawn.  Those people don't like the non-conventional, experimantal songs on Piper, preferring the drab, everyday, radio-friendly rock of such albums as The Wall and Dark Side of the Moon.  To them, I give a quiet reminder that compared to the boring and formulaic music on Floyd's later albums, Piper proves far more creative and enjoyable.<BR>     Song by song, Piper has many entertaining melodies.  It has everything from the out there, effective stop and go of Astronomy Domine to the powereful riffs in Lucifer Sam and Interstellar Overdrive.  From the madcap, entertaining rhyming of Bike (I've got a bike, you can ride it if you like, etc.) to the unparalled improvisation in Take Up Thy Stethescope and Walk, Interstellar Overdrive, Flaming, Matilda Mother and Pow R. Toc H.  And covering nearly every song is that madcap British Invasion singing which makes you want to laugh out loud while you listen to this album over and over again.<br />P.S. Listen to this with a Diskman- the sound washes from ear to ear in a beautiful way, like waves on the ocean.
B00005QG9J|5.0|I dont have any other Incubus Cds, so I dont know what they sounded like then, but this albus is very good. It has a unique alternative tone mixed with weird-but-cool space sounds and even some almost Chinese-based flute and harp in some somgs. The lyrics are very good, they are poems if you really pay attention to thm. If you're looking for a unique alternative vband, Incubus is great.
B00005U2LM|4.0|this album is tight, the WU has finally gone back to basics and given the Shaolin masses joy. 'In the hood' is tight with a great beat, 'Soul Power' is original and brings back 'Flavour Flav', 'Babies' makes you hit the rewind button again and again with the classic beat, 'Radioactive' has all the obscure beats made famous by RZA, 'Back in the game' features Isley, 'Got ya gatt' brings back the rawness. WU strikes back!!
B00003CXXP|3.0|I cannot rightfully say this was a bad movie, but I'm almost tempted to. This was another greatly anticipated Hollywood film, due to the collaboration between the late great Kubrick and Steven Spielberg. I, personally, had no interest in the movie until I heard everyone debating whether or not the movie was a masterpiece or Hollywood garbage. To be a loyal movie buff, I had to see what it was all about, and discovered that it was paradoxically both of those descriptions. I did not have respect for Haley Joel Osment's acting ability, until he impressively proved in this movie that he could do more than whisper or act cute (Sixth Sense and Pay It Forward). Jude Law, on the other hand, has always been a favorite of mine. From Ripley to Existenz, Jude Law is an amazing actor, and this movie is no exception. There were moments of sheer brilliance that captivated the mind and even surprisingly gained some emotion, but there were parts that cancelled all that goodness out by making the movie appear a farce. The last forty minutes of the movie, unnecessarily explicated by a mindless, yet painfully didactic narrator, with a totally uninteresting, I would go so far as to say, stupid plot, serves as the best example of the garbage in the movie. It is saddening that Stanley Kubrick died before he could correct the fatal errors this movie is left with, but I'm not convinced that it would have been a complete masterpiece, even with his genius. At the transition, right before those remaining forty minutes, many argue the movie should have ended. I disagree, though it would have certainly been better than the tacked on Hollywood ending, it was still an interminable idea, that lost its intrigue even before that point. It's worth seeing this, but only if you care what everyone's been talking about.
0385505833|5.0|Well, it will not replace A Christmas Carol or A Wounderful Life but it should be made into a movie. Fun quick read and it makes you think about the meaning of Christmas in light of the events of this year.
0790734850|5.0|L.A. Confidential: rated R, 2 hours and 17 minutes<br /> With the ultimate cast of Kevin Spacey, Russell Crowe, Danny DeVito, and Kim Basinger, L.A. Confidential is a well-played, dramatic murder mystery. <BR> Los Angeles during the 1950's was looked at as a paradise, but crime, corruption, and sleaze ran this `Garden of Eden'. Hush, Hush, the tabloid magazine written by Sid Hudgens (DeVito), lives on the themes of these three unethical, social attributes. At the start of the film, Devito narrates by reading an article from the magazine aloud. These occasional excerpts provide an interesting viewpoint on the Hollywood of the 50's. Spacey and Crowe are the hotshot cops of California, renowned for their brave deeds. Spacey plays Sergeant Jack Vincennes, who has been giving Hush, Hush the meaty stories it thrives on, in return for the fame and publicity that he lives for. <BR>One of the leading crimelords in L.A. dresses prostitutes to look like movie stars. Basinger, the Veronica Lake look-alike, becomes closely involved with Lieutenant Bud White (Crowe). In doing so, she plays a major role in solving the many murders that take place throughout the movie. <BR>In the beginning, everything seems to be going according to plan, but as the characters develop, and the plot thickens, it becomes clear, things are not at all what they seem. Racism, possession of narcotics, conspiracy, and mass murder all become elements of this dramatically well played film, where each character serves his or her purpose. <br />L.A. Confidential, directed by Curtis Hanson, also starring Guy Pearce who is fantastic (also see Memento!), is a perfect combination of superb acting and nail-biting suspense for a flawless A+.
B000003TBP|5.0|Every song on Odelay is good.  It's not rock, techno, lo-fi, or folk, but it's more of a mix between them.  It's the kind of music you can groove to in your car.  Compared to his other albums Odelay is my favorite.  Midnite Vultures is just weird latin madness dance music, while Odelay is much more meaningful and soulful.  Compared to Mellow Gold I'd say it's more refined, but both are good.  Mellow Gold and Odelay are Beck at his best.  If you have never bought a Beck CD, buy this one.  It's good for people of all musical tastes.
B00005QG9J|5.0|I did not expect this ablum to sound the way it did but when I bought it i couldn't stop listening! I love the hard, slow and the middle songs. The whole album is awesome but i really liked blood on the ground, under my umbrella, just a phase and nice to know you! If you want to give yourself a real treat buy this album. It gets better the more you listen to it!
B00005LMBK|5.0|This is one of my favorite Cd's.  It's a happy, upbeat CD, but not in a Britney Spears way.  Most of the songs are a strange mix of British rock techno groove.  Please don't be influenced by Clint Eastwood and think the entire album is a groove rap CD.  Only 2 of the songs have that rapper, the rest are the lead singer.  My favorite track is 5/4, I'd recommend downloading it if you can.  It's very representative of the rest of the CD.  Gorillaz is a must have for people who (are like me and) like: Radiohead, God Lives Underwater, Vast, Beck, and kind of techno rock/pop, trip-hop, good music.
0743420373|1.0|I received this book as gift, and after reading it, I am glad I didn't spend any money on it. This book is a classic example of taking a few simple concepts and restating them in every imaginable form to reach a decent book length. The useful information could be summed up into a small pamphlet.<br />Subject matter:<BR>The basic premise of the book is how the average Joe and average millionaire may not be too terribly different. The author interviewed hundreds of millionaires and then analyzed the data from the interviews. They repeatedly comment about how &quot;Mr. penny-pinching trailer park owner is far better off with $1.5 million in the bank than Mr. Doctor with a great house and lifestyle, who only has $750,000 saved up.&quot; <br />The authors constantly rant about how being incredibly frugal and watching every penny spent will make you wealthy. While this may be true, none of the information presented ventures far beyond common sense.<br />Another tactic, which I found very annoying, was that various charts and data tables were listed multiple times but in varying ways. For instance a whole page may be taken up by a table dedicated to whether or not millionaires worry about things like cancer, their children's financial future, and the stock market. Three pages later, the same table may be listed, but with percentages rather than raw data scores. There are many instances where the same information is presented in what appears to be nothing more than an attempt to lengthen the book. I found myself wanting to pound my head against the wall.<br />I would not recommend this book to anyone looking to make good use of his or her time. I kept reading only in hopes that there would actually be a few pearls of knowledge to be gained. In the end, I wish I had put the book down shortly after reading the great discussion about millionaires and their ancestry. I truly could care less that there is a larger proportion of millionaires from Scottish descent than from Algerian roots. How is this helpful to me??<br />Don't waste your time reading this book in hopes that you'll come out of it with a great insight into financial well being. It just won't happen. This book seems more like a doctoral thesis gone commercial than a truly useful guide to financial security.<br />Thanks for your time...
B00003CXTG|4.0|My preconception of the movie was negative based on reviews by movie critics. However, recieving this DVD as a gift, I watched it with an open mind and found I really enjoyed it. No it is not a history channel documentary, as the ney sayers seemed to want it to be. It is a story about a handful of people caught up in the events surrounding the Pearl Harbor attack, and later the Doolittle raid on Tokyo. I found it to be excellent movie, that held my attention, such that I could not wait to slip in the second disc and finish the movie. The filming is great, the sound is powerful, and the storyline intense. The movie reveals the beauty of the Hawaiian Islands, and the tranquility prior to the attacks -- much like pre-9/11 NYC.<br />Most critics focus on the love story as a detraction, but I actually found it to be a humorous addition to the movie, which actually depicted the heroes of the story as real people. I found it touching, funny, suspenseful, and at times corny -- as of course that period of time was, compared to what we percieve as the norm today. I couldn't wait to watch this again the following night with my wife, who agreed with me that this was a great movie.
0440219078|4.0|I enjoyed reading The giver because it talks about how horrible life would be without the things God has given us. It talks about being trapped in a community with ALOT of rules, you cant see color, nor feel love or anything you can do in real life. I LOVED this book..yet the ending was quite odd than other books.OVERALL, Great Book!
B00004Z4WR|1.0|This was an average action movie.  I am neutral about whether it's worth renting or buying.  I just wanted to say something about one character.  There is this young African-American man in it.  He is just a Steppin' Fetchit' for the new millenium.  And people think Jarjar Binks was bad.  This movie had several Black men in it with good parts.  They even laugh at themselves by acknowledging that the young brother is like a &quot;ghetto smurf.&quot;  Still, if this is what Hollywood is providing as parts for young Black men, no wonder there was so much for Spike Lee to criticize in &quot;Bamboozled.&quot;  I wish they didn't have this stereotypical and undeveloped role in the film.
0048200158|4.0|This is a collection of some fine work by Tolkien, a mixture of of work on his ideas on fairy tales and how they develop (Tree and Leaf, Smith of Wootton Major) and his important translation of the Old English poem fragment, &quot;The Homecoming Beorthnoth, Beorthelm's Son&quot;.<br />Students of OE might want it just for and the fact that it complements the OE poem &quot;Battle of Maldon&quot; (where Beorhtnoth was the leader of the defending Anglo-Saxon forces, being slain in the process and leading to his &quot;homecoming&quot;.<br />If you go looking for the Hobbit or Lord of the Rings II, you will be disappointed.
1561006165|5.0|This is the 5th of Connelly's 8 books with Harry Bosch I have read and I think it is the best. There are continued surprises...good guys get taken out as well as bad guys. Always something new. There are hints as to what will happen....but not giveaways. And there is humor. I like Harry Bosch...I keep seeing Nick Nolte playing him in one of the movies from one of the books!
0783226063|4.0|forget the embarrassing dumb music stupid monologues and the fatc that a lot of the movie was changed by Lynch. This is a nicely made movie. It is not the best adaptation of Herbert's novel no but a nice scifi adventure it is. Kyle Maclachlan is perfect for the role of Paul Atreides. It should be remembered not as a failure for an adaptation of Frank Herbert's epic novel but instead one of the better use of special effects and scifi movies of the early 1980's. The special effects of this movie in my opinion were not matched again until Steven Spielberg's dinosaur adventure Jurassic Park.
0767803434|5.0|i'll be brief this film is an absolute rollercoaster. people who like SPEED and Gone in 60 seconds should see this movie. I really don't think much of plots but i thought this one was good. You'll enjoy the visual and special effects.
6304698526|4.0|wow what a chase scene the schreeches the jumps the skids this movie has it all with the chase scene. Even if you don't like the rest of the film the chase scene is enough to buy this dvd. All i ever do is jump right to the chase scene anyways. For those hardcore car lovers and liked gone in sixty seconds the original should take this dvd quickly.
0679734767|5.0|This is most definately the best Victorian mistery I have read!  Haunting, sinister, profound &amp; truly spine-tingling!  <br />When Mr. Utterson, a dry (yet very likeably) London Lawyer looks at the last will of his friend Dr. Henry Jekyll his suspicions are arroused; what is the relationship between his respectable friend Harry Jekyll and the evill Mr. Edward Hyde?  After Mr. Hyde is witnessed murdering a distinguished MP, Sir Danvers the story gets truly terrifying at times - yet I couldn't put it down!  <br />At first I thought that my knowing the ending (as most people will!) before I read the book would ruin it but I still found it most enjoyable!
B00005JKT8|2.0|While this story is sheer fantasy, it is sweetly intended but sorrily lacking in plot development, character interaction ( such as: Why didn't anyone visit Stuart in the hospital?) and overall momentum.<br />The building of affection between the two main characters, not to mention conflict (the foundation of any good story) was almost absent from this film.<br />The struggle of emotion between Kate (a modern executive woman of the 21st century) and Leopold (a man transported from the 19th century unvoluntarily) is almost non-existant since there is no real conflict adding dimension to the story.<br />Hugh Jackman offers up a good performance despite a lacklustre plot and co-star.  I fear Meg Ryan has played this role so many times that she lacks the sincerity to do it justice - though, in her defense she cannot be blamed entirely since the premise of the story doesn't exactly lend itself to becoming a romance that leaves you desperate for them to be with each other.  I found myself almost indifferent to their success - occassionally (and mildly at that) feeling a slight wish if only for Hugh Jackman's character, Leopold.  <br />Jackman deserves Golden Globe consideration for making this movie as tolerable as it is.  Simply put, this movie is sweet yet lacking in substance.
B00003CXI1|2.0|The special effects were good. Now to the rest.<br /><br />It was a poor movie. The acting, writing, and storyline itself were sad, pedantic, and formulaic. It is filled with deus ex machina's, including two pivotal points at the end. Without (the character) Harry Potter, there wouldn't even be a problem at the end to resolve! Most of the film is filled with the daily life of the school, and one keeps on an enduring wait for a real plot. You won't be disappointed- the plot does begin to develop in the last 1/2 hour of the movie.<br /><br />Now having seen the movie, I can finally understand all the concern with the magic in this story. It *is* qualitatively different from Tolkien or Lewis, on two counts. Firstly, magic is the point of the story, and the constant point. In [[ASIN:B000E8M0VA Lewis]] and [[ASIN:B000654ZK0 Tolkien]], magic is only a plot device that helps the real point of the story along. Here, one can't get away from it. Secondly, the magic is qualitatively different. This isn't Gandalf raising a staff and a burst of light appearing, or Aslan speaking of the deeper magic from beyond the dawn of time as he comes back to life after being slain on a stone slab. The magic presented in Harry Potter is the type that is actually practiced, or attempted- crystal balls, spells, potions, and the like. The emphasis in Potter is on the \\"how-to\\" of magic- how to actually make things happen. And while it is unlikely that someone could copy spells in the movie to get results, I could easily see where seeing or reading this could get them started on the road to other forms, such as the ouija board or \\"light as a feather\\". There are far worse things for children out there ([[ASIN:0780626966 Nightmare]], [[ASIN:B000FWHW86 Chucky]], etc.), but this isn't one of the best either.
0780631684|5.0|I would just like to start off by saying that I do not believe this movie deserves to be in the Horror/Slasher genre. Because of the overwhelming amount of intelligence, the above-average acting, and the original story, FINAL DESTINATION deserves to be in the Thriller genre. <br />Why, you ask? Because it's THRILLING, a word that can only be used for a certain amount of films. SCREAM, I KNOW..., and all of those other movies can make you jump, but do those movies last in your memory? Is there any true thought behind them? Do those movies make you look at the concepts of life and death differently? No. (Which is not to say that they're not good horror movies.)<br />That is why FINAL DESTINATION is one of the best, scariest, most thought-provoking, and most deliciously evil thrillers ever. Not convinced? See for yourself.
B000002GJH|5.0|This kind of grunge i like. When you put the pretentiousness of (dare i say) nirvana aside, you get reletively similar and redundant themes and songs. Grunge can't just eb about being unhappy. This album provides powerful insights by writer Chris Cornell, including some great lyrics, short and to the point, in Hunger Strike. The three pearl jam members shine through with their music, and ed vedder makes a greater cameo before he was popular enough to make a celebrity cameo. Also, it's great to hear matt cameron, my favorite rock drummer, jam with pearl jam members then, as he has joined them now. Chris Cornell delivers great emotion through his singing, as i see more clearly now on his solo album than even superunknown. Overall, this album practices good taste.
B00003CXSP|4.0|Despite what critics may say, HANNIBAL is a great thriller! The locations, the acting, the writing, the suspense... everything was right on target! <br />Sir Anthony Hopkins is flawless in the role he was born to play. Julianne Moore is great in the role of Clarice Starling. Unfortunately, she has been subjected to many unfair comparisons to the orginal Clarice, Jodie Foster. Ray Liotta, Giancarlo Giannini, Frankie Faison, Francesca Neri, and an unrecognizable Gary Oldman make up the film's incredible supporting cast.<br />Ridley Scott is a genius! He captures the breathtaking beauty of Florence, Italy, so well. He also has a bunch of interesting camera trick up his sleeve. <br />Scott, screenwriter David Mamet, author Thomas Harris, the cast, and the rest of the creative/productive staff all do a great job in creating an intriguing and scary thriller!<br />*NOTE*: Before seeing it, please do not instantly compare it with SILENCE OF THE LAMBS. HANNIBAL is not SILENCE..., nor will it ever be. So get over it and you'll enjoy it a lot more.
B0000028UK|3.0|As much as everyone else says, 1993 to 1995 proved to be pearl jam's most uneven and exploritory years. VS. marked the first step of this. Consider the great opening Go, delivers a punch of familiar Pearl Jam. Animal practices great anger grunge. Daughter, almost folky, gives a nice relaxing point. But then we get the shclock of glorified g. After this, the album is uneven to say the least. Dissident is great, but wma, though showing signs of the drumming that would accompany in my tree and who you are later, drags on and goes nowhere. Blood is wasted anger. RVM and Rats are great powerful songs. And then we get as ed vedder says: the longest title in the pearl jam catalogue, however a beautiful song about aging nonetheless. Then we get a wasted rocker, and the flat indifference, which is later made a little better by ben harper's vocals (i saw them at the bridge school benefit) which come later in time. So, VS. has its moments, as does Vitalogy (which has about the same with even more schlock), but fails to to be a Ten or Yield. The expirimenting was necessary, and is well aprreciated. After all, we get great albums later on.
B00005QK3W|4.0|poor old Paul! that vintage bottle of wine that was Lennon/ McCartney, in the world of critics, is always half full for John and half empty for Paul nowadays. <BR>While Paul continues to make great music, he also continues to do all the things that his harshest critics hate. He must know this.It makes me wonder why he continues to do it. <BR>Driving rain is yet another prime example of the good[bass playing, occasional great lyrics,always strong melodies etc.] the bad[knock off lyrics, singing higher than sounds comfortable for his present range, being too cute, etc].<BR>Paul I guess is trying to put out too much material all the time.The average Beatles album wouldn't have more than 15 minutes by any one guy. Driving Rain has what, 70 minutes? <BR>Leave out the weaker tracks[given up talking, spinning, lover to a friend, ] and maybe put in Vanilla Sky, or for fun I'm Down from Concerts for New York, and Paul didn't have a bad 2001 recording year.<BR>Also to consider, I view Lennon/McCartney as equally brilliant. It is a shame John is gone , but it is a shame the way history is being revised. John and Paul have both done great albums and horrible albums. If Double Fantasy was the direction John was going in after a 5 year retirement, he was probably getting ready for some pretty heavy critical bashing of his own.
B00005QIPH|4.0|I basicly don't like music publications nor do I watch any MTV, so by chance I heard \\"Last night\\" on a local radio station.  This is a stripped bare rock record and that's a good thing no matter who everyone and their mother thinks they have ripped off their sound from.  In the unfortunate \\"hyped up consumeristic\\" era we are in it is impossible for them to escape the microscope of every Johnny come lately musical expert.  I have been into the punk scene for about 16 years and I understand that for some unknown reason it is just not \\"cool\\" for a band to be popular, upper middle class, talked about and liked by people other than \\"true unbending scene slobs\\".  Good news folks,  your kind eventually matures.  You can still be so called \\"cool\\" and like any ...band/music on the planet!  <br />     Yes this has been done before and no they are not saving    any scene or musical genre,  what they are doing is playing      music that can be liked by a wide variety of people and I don't see the problem with that.  It's o.k. to like something even though the masses have discoverd it.  <br />     The Strokes have written some great catchy tunes on Is This It, in my opinion the entire record is solid with no signs of filler material.  I hear tinges of The Smiths songwriting structures with more punch and edge.  Also I detect some New Order/Joy Division influences here.  At times the bass lines are reminiscent of the driving, howling sound of a New Order tune,  and the vocals have a tinge of the haunting Joy Division.  I won't make all the other comparisons that are listed infintly by most of the reviews and numerous publications, those have been overstated.<BR>     <BR>     If you like good, catchy, edgy, raw, stripped down rock and roll this is worth your time and money. <br />     Oh yeah, does anyone else out there detect a tinge of the Sid and Marty Croft Superstars?  Maybe that's why I like this disk, it reminds me of watching H.R. Puffinstuff, Sigmund the Sea Monster and The Buggalos on Saturday mornings when I was a kid.......
B00005RFQ5|5.0|Now, this is the type of music my ears have been waiting 2 hear.  Let's see, U hav infectious grooves, jazzy funk, beautiful ballads, and some of the hardest rock 2 come out within the past decade or so 2 co-exist with lyrics that R both positive and thought provoking.  Of course, who else can deliver such great music other than PRINCE?  Let's face it, those who expect &quot;When Doves Cry&quot;, &quot;Raspberry Beret&quot;, or &quot;Purple Rain&quot; R obviously stuck in the '80s.  Prince is thru with that era and the 90's 4 that matter.  He's a true testament 2 artistic freedom, creativity, and of course musicianship.  2 all those who claim that they're a &quot;huge&quot; Prince fan, but, can't resist comparing this album 2 albums of the past should stop complaining and appreciate The Rainbow Children 4 what it is:  music that amuses and enlightens.  By the way, I've been a HUGE supporter of Prince's musical genius since my mother took me 2 C Purple Rain in '84.  I've been collecting all of his albums as well as joined his NPG Music Club.  Whether he puts out a good album or bad 1, I'm still breaking my neck 2 get it 2 show support 4 his vision of deconstructing the digital garden.  Let's C if any of his so-called &quot;huge&quot; fans (the 1's that compare his current album 2 those of the past) R currently doing that.  <br />Bottom line:  in the year 2001, only 1 album that contained thought provoking lyrics and musical genius was released and that album iz THE RAINBOW CHILDREN.  Buy it and listen 2 it with an open mind.  U'll be enlightened and musically satisfied.
B00005ATQD|5.0|I think that this is a completely misunderstood picture.  I can't count the times that I had heard that &quot;Eyes Wide Shut sucks, it's nothing but pedophilia and lousy story line&quot;.  Nothing could be further from the truth.  This is one of those films that shows what cinema can be, not just the average, thoughtless, meandering, and overdone films that everyone thinks it should be.  The critics for the most part dismissed it as self indulgent Kubrick, but who cares what the folks who &quot;can't do anything else with their pathetic existence but criticize&quot; thinks, oh yeah the gullable, guidable, movie going consumer does?  <br />     If you like films that portray a slice of the human condition in a consistent with reality sort of way, you will enjoy this film.  If you don't enjoy thinking about what you are watching you should probably stick to must see T.V. or the Playstation.  <br />     This movie is full of psychological suspense and keeps you trying to figure out exactly what the characters are thinking, where is this plot going, why would he do that, why wouldn't he do that, did she do that, etc......   The atmosphere of the film set to a trance like score is simply excellent, it is simply     intoxicating.  If you enjoy films like Taxi Driver, Ironweed, Trainspotting, and Fight Club you can't go wrong with this one.
0385505833|4.0|Skipping Christmas is a great book if you're looking for a quick read that offers a cute story, laugh-out-loud lines, and no evil plot or villians.  It's not John Grisham's usual legal thriller, but it's still good.  I think at one time or another, every one can relate to Mr. Krank's feelings.  This book is definitely worth the few hours it takes to read.
630264366X|5.0|To be honest, I, a serious convert to the Catholic faith, knew nothing about &quot;The Scarlet and the Black&quot; or the man which Gregory Peck portrays until yesterday, when I watched it on the History Channel (followed by a piece on Pope Pius XII and the Holocaust). This is truly a great film! The acting is top notch, and I cannot express my surprise at seeing &quot;The Sound of Music's&quot; leading man playing a commanding Nazi! Obviously filmed on and around it's beautiful location, this a film with a story that will inspire people of all faiths and backgrounds to stand up for what they believe and do what is right. My only complaint is that this film, in concurrence with present ideas, does not give the  deserved credit to the Venerable Pope Pius XII (they are books available about him on amazon.com ... &quot;Hitler's Pope&quot; by Cornwall IS NOT ONE OF THEM!!!). Despite this rather annoying flaw, &quot;The Scarlet and the Black&quot; is a piece of cinema history, forgotten in a day when the Church is portrayed as a dark deluded organization (&quot;End of Days&quot;) or money hungry hypocrites (&quot;The Godfather III&quot;). Watch! Enjoy!

B00005N9CV|5.0|I originally rated this with three stars in September because all the selections were slow and there was very little piano. I have since met her and watched her perform from a backstage vantage point. From my perspective as a jazz pianist for 46 years backing many vocalists, I can easily say that she is my absolute favorite jazz singer/pianist. She's a true professional jazz musician and entertainer.  I read recently that she has sold 94% of the seats available since starting her concert tours. This album is an excellent collection of some of her finest work.
B0000399WI|5.0|One of the best movies of all time full of reality, bonding, drama and tears. I took my mom to see this movie in 1993 for her birthday. Then bought it recently on DVD. Excellent performaces by Tim and Morgan with and excellent plot. A must have!
B00005JCAA|4.0|Anthony Hopkins finds his best roles in situations where he is in some plum obsessive/compulsive spot in the social order, and Joe Black gives him a very fine opportunity as Bill Parrish to passionately carry on with his convictions and his principles, regardless of how the outside world feels about him. This is a wonderful, deep, meditative, and amusing film, with more than a few improbable plot twists.<br /><br />Meet Joe Black has a lot in common with \\"Heaven Can Wait\\": Wealthy industrialist must meet his death, and love and a fortune hang in the balance, but does it with a more serious, sensitive and ponderous style.<br /><br />Anthony Hopkins is totally fascinating to watch. His powerful stride, his gestures, every deference to the routine, the duties, the responsibilities will draw you into Parrish's carefully sculptured world.<br /><br />As Parrish's daughter, Claire Forlani's fluttering, warm eyes carry more information and subtlety per second of screen time than those of nearly any other actor or actress. Wow! Those eyes are a major visual component of this movie! Forlani is fantastic!<br /><br />Thomas Newman's score is great, great, great. I can listen to it again and again.<br /><br />There is a place at the end where things fall apart a little bit. How does Susan Parrish intuit that Joe is not who she thought he was? Then she intuits that he is who she hoped he might be? That is the trickiest part of making this story work.<br /><br />Nevertheless, Mr. Brest and the screenwriter are to be congratulated for the unique style they bring to this film...quirky, rich with pregnant pauses, thoughtful. A great cast all around. A film to refresh the soul. I love it!
B00004RFFI|5.0|Full of love, romance, and plenty of edghe of your seat action. This is one of Bill Paxtons movies. And definatelty worth to buy.
B000005DQR|5.0|This is one of the best albums I own.  It's brimming with emotion and every song flows with incredible beauty.  It's an album you can think to.
B00000K19E|4.0|Excellent sci-fi film very well made. With excellent performaces and graphics. Definately worth watching!
B00005R2M3|5.0|When I bought this album I did not know what to expect.  I just knew that I love all types of music and this is a new venture.  I do not know any spanish but since I already have Nelly Furtado's album I knew I would enjoy Shkira.  And yes I did enjoy most of the songs on the album are about love and pain,  I would saw Shakira did an excellent job with her first english album.
6305176299|5.0|It's gonna be one heck of a ride full of edge of your seat action. Excellent performaces by everyone. When I first saw this movie in 1994, I loved it from the start. I just recently bought it on DVD and very happy to own it.
B0000028RR|5.0|This is has got to be one of the greatest records ever recorded in the history of music. The way that every song hits my ears is just something so extrodinary and wonderful I feel that I must write this review. Rage Against The Machine has exploded onto the music seen. With there rock/rap onslaught, and threating political views on society, Rage has shown themsleves a force to be reconed with. Songs like Freedom and Bullet in the Head give the listener a whole new perspetive on society. But never have four men put toghter such a masterpiece. From the easy listening of Fist Full of Steel, to the raw rock of Killing in the Name, this album will take you on a ride threw musical genuis. Just the way that all the songs are mixed and put toghter is a true sigh of Rage's direction in the music world. You have got Tom Morello just all out rocking on the guitar, Zach de la Rocha tearing it up on the mike, Brad Wilk slammin on the drums, and Tim Bob slappin the bass. I promise who ever buys this record, you will NOT be dissappointed.
B00005PJ6M|2.0|Thats about all I can say. It is funny, but not the best comedy.
B00003CXAA|5.0|The final scene of GODFATHER PART 2 where Diane Keaton is seen<BR>lighting a candle in church is absent from the DVD.  What<BR>happened?  I wrote to the Coppola organization and the person<BR>who responded was not familiar with the scene.  Otherwise it<BR>is a great set.

B00000K3CR|3.0|I saw this movie years ago when it first came out in 1990. It was a great movie for the whole family to watch. Full of love, laughter.
B000056JYC|5.0|I am so excited to see this remastered recoring of FCA! My uncle's name is Stan Sheldon, and he was the bassist with Peter. I think it's a real honor to him, as well as the rest of the band to have this done for them, plus it sounds better than ever!Thanks so much!
B00005A3KS|5.0|I first saw this movie back in 1991 and loved it and I now own it on DVD. One of the best movies ever with HOTTTT Keanu Reeves. Full of action, drama and love. Excellent plot with great performances.
B00005QG9J|5.0|&quot;Morning View&quot; is a bit mellower than &quot;S.C.I.E.N.C.E&quot; or &quot;Make Yourself&quot;, but it just shows that Incubus is willing to allow themselves room to evolve.  I haven't been able to put this CD away since I got it about two months ago.  There is a lot of experimental stuff on this album, like the closing track &quot;Aqueous Transmission&quot; which has a very Asian feel to it.  Definitely one of the coolest albums to come out this year.  Some of my personal high points on this album are &quot;Just A Phase&quot; (the 2 1/2 minute intro is awesome), &quot;11 AM&quot;, &quot;Echo&quot; and &quot;Are You In&quot; (any song mentioning the coolness of seafoam green has to get some props).
B00005QDW1|1.0|If you like clichd electronic pop, you will like this album.  I, unfortunately, do not.
B00005AFMT|5.0|King Crimson is an enigma. Ostensibly the child of Robert Fripp (the only member to appear on every album), KC is not a Fripp vanity project, but a fully functional musical unit that has always tried to push the boundaries of \\"progressive rock.\\" Listening to two different albums may give the listener two distinctly different impressions of this band since they have always tried to challenge themselves and their audience, with differing degrees of success. This 1981 recording is an excellent starting point for someone looking to sample King Crimson. The musicianship of this quartet is phenomonal. Anchored by master percussionist Bill Bruford (comfortable both as the drummer for the most successful lineup of Yes and as a sensitive jazz improviser) and ace session bassist Tony Levin (Peter Gabriel, Paul Simon, John Lennon, Chuck Mangione, Alice Cooper ... you name it, Levin's done it!), guitarists Fripp & Adrian Belew (Talking Heads, Bowie, Laurie Anderson...you get the idea!) take the interlocking counterpoint experiments of Steve Reich and create an album of songs that is both challenging and tuneful. I dare you not to tap your foot to the funky (yes, funky!) \\"Elephant Talk\\". Other highlights include the expansive \\"Sheltering Sky\\" and the hard-driving \\"Thela Hun Ginjeet\\". If you are a fan of Remain in Light-era Talking Heads, Peter Gabriel (before Sledgehammer), or simply appreciate extraordinary musicians pushing the boundaries of rock music, this is an excellent introduction to a great band.
B00003CXZ4|5.0|This movie is artistically one of the best movies ever made.  The storyline keeps you guessing till the end, while nothing is as you expect it to be.  Guy Pearce is wonderful.  This movie should be seen by everyone at least once to see what a real movie should be like; imaginative, suspenseful, and all around good.  Christopher Nolan does an excellent job bringing together a complicated story, wonderful acting, and an excellent production team.
B000001FOL|4.0|So many people whom I have come across either have not heard of Nico or see her as some type of person with very little musical ability or intuition, and a hanger on to  the Velvet Underground. This recording gives a nice initial  introduction to Nico, her voice and pronunciation etc, though it perpetuate's the afformentioned perception of her. There are some nice songs here sang with her inimitable style. Interesting songs for me are These day's, Winter song, I'll keep it with mine, and Wrap your troubles in dreams. If one likes this and you want to know more of Nico's orginal sound/ music then go for the Marble index, and Desertshore. Nico was truly original and innovative in her approach to life and  and her  music reflects this. If you like diverse and emotinally reflective songs which do not border on one &quot;reaching for the bucket&quot; then Nico might be enjoyed by you.
B000005ILF|4.0|When this album came out I was more than happy to hear Ten Summoner's Tales Part 2. When I finished listening to this album I could only think, \\"that's it, he's done, it's over.\\" This album cries of retirement. I was even more surprised to see Brand New Day after this. I am not saying this is a bad album, not at all, but after a first listen, compared to Summoner's, this sounds like he's ready to throw in the towel.<br />From the harsh starting track, painfully hitting the core of \\"The Hounds of Winter\\" excellently with his music, to the last simple closer of \\"Lithium Sunset,\\" the songs are slower, simpler, and less playful. Those wanting a more mature sound would enjoy this album greatly. \\"La Belle Dame Sans Regret\\" and \\"Valparaiso\\" shows just how mature his sound as become. Sting's vocal performance is incredibly good, but the instruments are lacking in any more dynamic.<br />Sting doesn't stray from his trademarks, thankfully, as poly-rhythms decorate songs like \\"I Hung My Head\\" (at 9/4, wow...) and \\"I Was Brought to My Senses\\" (7/2). His lyrics aren't any less ironic or savvy as his previous albums, either. Take the lyrics off his straight country tune, \\"I'm So Happy I Can't Stop Crying,\\" for instance. \\"Saw my lawyer Mr. Good News, he got me joint custody and legal separation.\\" This is when he's describing a painful divorce from his wife. So brilliantly told you'd think he and Trudie were having marriage problems.<br />Tracks I don't like are songs like \\"You Still Touch Me\\" and \\"All Four Seasons.\\" First of all, the bass line of \\"Seasons\\" is a direct rip from \\"When We Dance\\" and is more effective in the latter as well. Both songs are bluesy and yearning, but are unfulfilled as the brass section is basically the only thing holding the song in a form, and even with them it's awkward.<br />This album is not a throwaway or a waste of money by any means. Sting still shines in his lyrical and musical capabilities. Each song is performed beautifully. What is lacking issome kind of dynamic that Summoner's had. Those who found the previous album to sporadic, however, will definitely enjoy this album.
B00005QW5X|5.0|Probably the best movie of the year...Other reviews give the basic plot. Suffice it to say that there's a little Hedwig in all of us.... The acting is superb,as are the graphics. Kudos to the cast,writers etc. The accompaning documentary is great. Do yourself a favor&amp; buy it. If you like Rocky or being John Malkovich (spend 15 minutes in Hedwig's head!), or Fight Club you'll like HEDWIG... it touches all emotions...Can not wait to see &amp;(hear) John Cameron Mitchell's next...may be the further adventures of HEDWIG.... what an action figure Heddie would make:)
0446608955|5.0|Don't listen to those who say the the simplicity of the novel is a negative.  They just don't get it.  The beauty of the story lies in its simplicity.  Sure, Nicholas Sparks could have added another 20,000 words of meaningless prose.  Perhaps then it could be called &quot;literary.&quot;  <br />Give me a break.  Just because a novel is not littered with 50-cent words that the author had to look up himself does not mean it is without value.<br />AWTR is a quick read, yes.  But it is also a sweet story that makes you think.<br />Oh yeah, to all of the reviewers who say they/their 3-year old/their dog could have written this:<BR>Ummm, how many times have you been pulished.<br />Exactly.
B00003CX8J|5.0|I first saw this movie during the summer and it mesmerized me. The story of a young girl's (Rogue, played by Anna Paquin) discovery that anyone who touches her is hurt badly, X-Men shows her journey and fellow mutant's(Wolverine) to a place where the mutants live at, a school and where the teachers are part of a team of mutants that battle evil, the X-Men. It turns out the evil mutant wants Rogue to help him take over the human world and it will take the X-Men to save her. Will they though? You'll have to see the movie to know.

0399143904|4.0|Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six gives the very inside details of what it's like to be behind-the-scenes FBI agent. If you have completely no interest in crime scene srategies I highly recommend you choose a different book. <BR>Rainbow Six takes a little while to get into, but once you hit the teams first climax point, you will be stuck to the plot. The relationships between the teams members also carry the plot to a true American genre. <BR>I can't quite agree with one of the quotes on the side covers as &quot;thrilling&quot;, but I can say there are points were you coerce yourself into reading passages again in disbelief.
0345451325|5.0|Best Darn book i have ever read, I'm into books like &quot;The Lucifer Factor&quot; and i never read any of eric nylunds work, now i am! ill move onto &quot;The Game Of Universe&quot; This book is intriging, also has Excelente!~! Char development, it was like i grew up with them as a child hood friend or sumthen. I desperately urge you to read this book no matter what bad things u hear from people.
6302250269|5.0|The storyline is simple and maybe too unbelievable. Most of the male characters are stereotypes. But this movie is really about the psychological states of the two female leads and their road journey. And the movie does an absolutely terrific job portraying these and getting the message across, precisely.<br />Susan Sarandon is brilliant (though I think she does a somewhat even better job in \\"Dead Man Walking\\"), and Geena Davis is just fantastic. Davis delivers a performance so amazing that I like her as an actress and her as the character Thelma right away. Too bad that she's up against Jodie Foster in 1991's Oscar.<br />Harvey Keitel's character (a sympathetic cop) is a nice touch. He's there to tell us that Louise and Thelma are not merely some crazy, self-centered irresponsible women. He said in the last scene, \\"How many times has this woman (Louise) has gotta be fxxked over...\\" <br />Some may feel the ending is too sad, inappropriate or unnecessary. But I just love that ending. It sums up everything of the movie. Perhaps one shouldn't look at it as an unrealistic end of their lives; It's an end of their ADVENTURE. It's their LIBERATION. Just imagine how Louise and Thelma may feel when they make the final decision and what they may be thinking about moments before the end, holding each other's hand... oh, what the heck....
B00003CXXI|5.0|Cameron Diaz' second best film (after 'Something About Mary'), Mike Myers' best, and could it be that Eddie Murphy has finally found his calling as the voice of animal sidekicks? All around, a solid, imaginative, and genuinely funny -- for kids and adults -- movie.
B0000009SY|1.0|So far, Zappa's most boring album in my collection to date. Starts out strong, then turns into a sophomoric snicker fest that no one but the artist would relate to. Uninvolved, musically speaking. Only worth borrowing from a friend for the title track and \\"Catholic Girls\\", both of which can probably be found live in a better form, and hopefully around better material. After that, theres groupies, machine sex, and a world without music. Im sure The Master was trying to make a statement here, but in the end, youre not moved to care. You can almost tell Zappa knows its a tossoff. A three album tossoff, to boot.
B00004VW35|2.0|Neil's career spans the spectrum from country (this album) to punk, but never does he seem more out of his element. This, to my ears, fails  to be either good Neil Young or good country.  No reason to listen, except for the most enthusiastic collectors of Young. <BR>'Harvest' is a much better effort at Young country (if you'll pardon the expression).
B000002AHC|5.0|He does, I guess. But that is what Roger Mcguinn and Chris Hillman said,and the result is this: magic. A soothing, subtly psychedelic hippytrip that effectively captures what we all think was the spirit of the time(I wasnt there). Hillman and Mcguinn's castoff of pure folk brought them down all sorts of experimental roads in the acid rock and country veins. And what a combination, I might add. The record starts out with a celebratory paean to amphetamines, then some thoughtful pastiches about hippy life(Change Is Now, Draft Morning, Tribal Gathering, Natural Harmony), and the cut from Easy Rider, \\"Wasn't Born To Follow\\". All the songs are imbued with dreamy, hallucinatory imagery, phasing galore, and the raga riffs you love the Byrds for. Theres lots of nifty bonuses on the CD-including a song by Crosby cut from the album-WHY, I have no idea. \\"Triad\\", a song about a threesome love affair, is really gorgeous. Dont get me wrong, Crosby was a genius, but when he left this band, the Byrds didnt suffer. Another neat bonus is a secret track where you can hear the Byrds trying to put together a version of \\"Natural Harmony\\" in the studio, and fighting vehemently about the worth of the song. Michael Clarke, the drummer, would leave during this recording as well. Good timepiece, all around. As good as \\"Younger than Yesterday\\".
B00000K0DT|5.0|San Pedro: the aftermath of what looks like a huge explosion dockside. The burning wreckage of a boat and the charred remains of bodies are being dragged out of the harbour by the authorities. It seems like the classic heist gone wrong scenario: five criminals trigger bloody mayhem in attempting to hijack the exchange of [money amount] worth of cocaine between Argentine and Hungarian gangsters. Only two men escape with their lives, one of the Hungarian gangsters, Arkosh Kovash, and Roger \\"Verbal\\" Kint (Kevin Spacey in superb form), one of the five hijackers, and a cripple to boot.<br />In Bryan Singer's masterful directorial debut we learn how, six weeks earlier, the five men (Gabriel Byrne, Kevin Pollak, Stephen Baldwin, Benicio del Torro and Spacey) came together in the film's most famous scene - the police identity parade. The Usual Suspects line up for what turns out to be a trumped up police charge which none of them will admit to being implicated in. Locked up in the same cell for the night, they proceed to hatch a plot to rob New York's finest taxi service, a ring of corrupt cops who take bribes from criminals in return for immunity. Only Dean Keaton (the ever impressive Byrne) wants nothing to do with this plan. An ex cop turned criminal, with a reputation for absolute ruthlessness, Keaton is under investigation by FBI agent Dave Kujan (Chazz Palminteri) despite his attempts to go straight. Keaton and Verbal are already acquainted after meeting in prison some years earlier, but Verbal is unknown to the others, and they will only include him in the job if Keaton is on board as well.<br />Through Kujan's interrogation of Kint we learn of the unfolding events and how he persuaded Keaton to become involved. The one flaw that each man shares is that he is addicted to committing crime, and predictably after the taxi service heist the men take on another job hijacking a consignment of diamonds. Unfortunately for them, they get involved with the wrong people and soon find themselves forced into taking on what seems like another, suicidal, job.<br />It becomes clear that there is more to the story than Verbal is letting on, but every time Kujan seems to be getting close to the truth, Kint goes off at a tangent. In parallel to this thread is the interrogation of the horrifically maimed Kovash, who is clearly dying, but before lapsing into unconsciousness in hospital manages to utter the name of the man who seems to be responsible for the carnage in San Pedro, \\"Keyser Soze\\". <br />The name inspires utter terror in Kovash and when Kujan mentions it to Kint, the same terror seems to take hold of him. Reluctantly, Verbal explains the myth of Keyser Soze - a mysterious underworld figure who every criminal has heard about, but whom nobody knows. Legend has it that back in the days when Soze was a relatively minor criminal in Hungary he butchered his own family rather than surrender to the local mob, proceeded to hunt down and kill his persecutors and their families, and then vanished, becoming a kind of bogey man for other criminals who, if they crossed him, inevitably came to a gruesome end. <br />A razor sharp script by Christopher McQuarrie (which won an Oscar for best screenplay), brilliantly taut and suspenseful direction and a fine ensemble cast make The Usual Suspects an electrifying experience. It possesses all the components to make it one of the best thrillers in recent memory, and will literally have you on the edge of your seat. The fiendishly confusing plot will leave you struggling in its wake and the ending is a stroke of sheer, twisted brilliance. Marvellous.
B0000009SI|5.0|Jaded Zappaphiles want to dismiss this one, I see...well, give the uninitiated a break, will you? This album is great, even though its not necessarily as weird as a lot of his other groundbreakers. Well put together, and hilarious. Shows off well his unique brand of humor, and gives you something you aren't ashamed to rock to, either. The Nanook suite is indispensable. Buy, buy, buy.
B00005R87Q|5.0|For those who saw and loved &quot;Gone in 60 Seconds&quot;, you will definately love this movie. Although this movie also has really nice sport-racing cars and excellent looking women, I still think it is 10 times better than &quot;Gone in 60 seconds&quot;; with exciting high speed chases and hot rodding scenes going well over 220 mph. This movie also has an excellent soundtrack, and not to mention, an excellent plot that cannot be beat! I have seen it in the theatre five times, and I just bought it here at the best price I could find anywhere! I know that I will be watching this movie over and over again for the years to come. It was definately worth my time and it has always kept me on the edge of my seat!
0061040967|5.0|because I thought it was overpriced for its length. However, my oldest son bought it for me for Christmas, and I may just have to leave my entire estate to him as a result. It's a marvelous book, albeit short, but the illustrations more than make up for the brevity of the tale. Leonard of Quirm's Mona, the many species of swamp dragon, the flying ship, the view of the elephant head rising over the moon -- it's all wonderful. The story brings together all elements of the series except the witches of Lancre and even adds a minstrel, whose character development adds meat to the stew. I agree with one other reviewer on an important point, however: how could you leave the luggage behind?!!!!
B00005PJ6M|5.0|I am extremely happy that this title has finally made it to DVD.  The movie is just down right hysterical.  Bill and Ted playing the Reaper in Battleship and Twister to return to this life was a comedy classic.  Buy this movie for light-hearted fun and laughs.  Maybe someday I will be Missy's next husband.
0792833686|5.0|This is a movie that'll give you Happy Feet just thinking about it once you've seen it.  Quite possibly the purest movie musical ever made, \\"Singin' In the Rain,\\" directed by Gene Kelly and Stanley Donen, has everything you could want in a musical:  A good story, perfect cast, imaginative choreography, memorable music and songs, terrific performances, and a presentation that is nothing less than inspired.  It takes you behind the scenes of the movie business, set during the transitional period between the heyday of silent films and the advent of talkies.  Don Lockwood (Kelly) and Lina Lamont (Jean Hagen) are two of the biggest stars in Hollywood, the Tracy and Hepburn of Monumental Studios, which is about to release their latest movie-- a swashbuckling costume drama.  But a rival studio has just released \\"The Jazz Singer,\\" and overnight the industry is revolutionized, and silent films are just that quickly a thing of the past.  To keep up and stay afloat, the major studios need to produce pictures that talk.  And where does Monumental start?  By retooling their latest big star vehicle (with Lockwood and Lamont) into a MUSICAL swashbuckling costume drama.  If it's song and dance the public wants, then that's what they'll get-- right along with the drama of the costume and the swashbuckling thrown in to boot.  There's one problem, though; the sound of Lina's voice has the effect of fingernails scraping a chalkboard, and her diction isn't going to land her the role of Juliet anytime soon.  The powers that be at Monumental fear they may soon have a \\"falling\\" star on their hands.  But there's always a solution, of course; and leave it to Don's partner, Cosmo (Donald O'Connor), to come up with it.  And it just happens to involve a young lady named Kathy (Debbie Reynolds), with whom Don has just recently become acquainted.  And that's where the story really begins.    <br /> Kelly and Donen (who also teamed up for \\"On the Town\\" and \\"It's Always Fair Weather\\") certainly know how to put on a show.  The name of their game is Entertainment-- yes, with a capital \\"E\\"-- and that's exactly what you get.  The dazzling production numbers are upbeat and electrifying:  Donald O'Connor's \\"Make `Em Laugh;\\" \\"Good Mornin',\\" which features Debbie Reynolds (joined by Kelly and O'Connor); a diction lesson by Kelly and O'Connor that begins with \\"Moses,\\" who \\"Supposes his `toeses' are roses;\\" and a transporting routine with Kelly and Cyd Charisse.  But the highlight is Kelly doing the title song while \\"Singin' and dancin' in the rain.\\"  And these are but a few of the magical marvels of this film.<br /> When Kelly sings \\"Gotta dance!\\" you'd better believe it, because he's the best of the best, and he's at the top of his game here.  He's a consummate entertainer and a perfectionist, and simply a joy to watch.  And with O'Connor next to him you really have something special, as they tend to bring out the best in one another (I submit their \\"Moses\\" number as evidence).  Also, they seem to genuinely enjoy working together; there appears to be an almost fun sense of spirited competition going on as they dance, and it's an invigorating experience (if this wasn't so, then they've pulled off a marvelous bit of acting).  But no one can out-dance Gene Kelly.  Period.  And he may not be the world's greatest singer, but in this film his voice is in top form, as well.  <br /> Also a consummate performer, Donald O'Connor more than holds his own with Kelly on the dance floor (and he's at the top of a very short list of those who can), and the sense of humor and personality he brings to the film are invaluable.  His energetic \\"Make `Em Laugh\\" number does just that; and while it's funny, it also showcases O'Connor's versatility and gives him a chance to display some amazing moves (how many people-- even professional dancers-- can dance up the side of a wall and into a back flip?).  And he makes it look so easy.  As Cosmo, he's the quintessential second banana and jack-of-all-trades.  He dances, sings, plays piano, cracks jokes, pops up for tech work in the sound booth, and on top of everything else he's an idea man and a general facilitator of anything and everything that needs facilitating.  If Danny Kaye had a brother it would be O'Connor; and-- like Kelly-- he's just a pleasure to watch.<br /> Debbie Reynolds was twenty-years-old when she made this film, and she's a perfect fit with Kelly and O'Connor.  Beautiful and talented-- and mature beyond her years-- she has a kind of sparkle all her own and a terrific screen presence.  She can sing and she can dance, she looks good no matter what she's doing, and there's a wholesome, girl-next-door quality about her that makes her endearing.  It also makes Kathy a very real and believable character, and Reynolds plays her perfectly.<br /> As Lina Lamont, the girl with a voice that could make cats cry, Jean Hagen is an absolute riot.  Reminiscent of a character Mia Farrow would create years later in \\"Radio Days,\\" Sally White-- though perhaps a bit more dense-- Lina takes the \\"vain\\" out of \\"vanity,\\" and Hagen brings her to life with a vivid, memorable performance.  And it's just another of the many elements that make this such a great film.<br /> The supporting cast includes Millard Mitchell (Simpson), Rita Moreno (Zelda), Douglas Fowley (Roscoe) and Kathleen Freeman (Phoebe).  If pure entertainment is what you're after, you need look no further than \\"Singin' In the Rain,\\" which successfully dispels any doubts that there is, indeed, magic in the movies.  Because this movie is magic, a sheer delight from beginning to end no matter how many times you see it.  There's been a number of great musicals made over the years, but of them all, with Kelly and O'Connor at the top of their form, this one just may be the definitive offering.
B00004STPT|5.0|I loved the movie, so I thought I'd try the soundtrack.  Let me just say that it is great.  I listen to it everyday!
B00000INEX|5.0|We have several of the Baby Einstein videos and they are all good...our son seems to enjoy the music ones more so than the others, but maybe that is just because I really enjoy them so I probably play them a little more often.  I would recommend any of the videos!!
B00005OM4N|5.0|This is the cd for the fans from Britney. Britney has really grown from album to album you can totally tell from this album how she has grown as a artist. This has to be the best cd yet! When I first heard it I had to look at the jaket to see what songs Britney wrote and she kicks ...for a songwriter!I am glad she is writing and making sure her voice is heard. Way to go girl I am so very proud of u for showing us the real side of you!
B00005QZ7U|5.0|I missed &quot;Moulin Rouge&quot; in the theatres.<br />In retrospect, the best way to see &quot;Moulin Rouge&quot; WAS in the moviehouse. The energy and passion of this undescribable film DESERVE and DEMAND the biggest screen possible, because the extravaganza leaps from the screen in its full, warped Technicolor glory.<br />&quot;Moulin Rouge&quot; is either a movie that you &quot;get&quot; or you &quot;don't.&quot; If you &quot;get&quot; it, &quot;Moulin Rouge&quot; will most likely become your favorite movie: for example, it has become my &quot;Chase Your Blues Away&quot; flick...that &quot;Dance Around Your Living Room In Your Underwear Just Because You Can-Can&quot; flick.<br />But if you don't &quot;get&quot; it, &quot;Moulin Rouge&quot; just will not appeal to you AT ALL. It's that devisive. I'm not certain why, as I think &quot;Moulin Rouge&quot; is the cat's meow...but that's just how it is. You either completely &quot;get&quot; it...or you utterly don't...<br />...and for me to describe &quot;Moulin Rouge&quot; would be a great disservice to the movie. Does it have more energy than any movie I've seen in years, yet is not an action testostronathon? Yup. Is it a pop-song composed musical set in a parralel trippy-verse where we're asked to believe not only that Christian (Ewan McGregor) is the world greatest poet, but that his poetry consists of modern pop-music? Yup. Do Ewan McGregor and Nicole Kidman generate more chemistry than any screen couple EVER, whilst singing Elton John-Nirvana-Madonna-Queen songs to one another (to say nothing of the rest of the brilliant cast)? Yup. And then some more of that same insanity.<br />You'll either love it or you'll hate it. Regardless of which side of the coin you're on, &quot;Moulin Rouge&quot; has one of the best DVD treatments you'll ever encounter, with lots of featurettes and documentaries detailing the structure behind the madness, a couple of commentary tracks, multi-angle dance sequences...where you pick oneof four angles and shuffle through to &quot;edit&quot; your own dance sequence (of four.) And there's so much more. Much like the movie, my words are only scratching &quot;Moulin Rouge's&quot; shiny surface.<br />Regarding &quot;Moulin Rouge,&quot; I have found that for those who &quot;get&quot; it, the connection is deep, romantically intense and personal in nature. For myself, it acts as a spiritual remedy for life's trying times...whether the trial is individual, such as career apathy and dissatisfaction, or more universal in nature: a reminder of the good, the true, and the joyful creations of man at a time when the &quot;real&quot; world is responding to humanity's dark side. <br />So check it out. If you &quot;get&quot; it, buy it. It will become one of your favorite DVD's...one you'll watch over and over again, with every viewing just as remarkable as the first. <br />Or you'll really hate it.
6305265488|5.0|This is a great movie!  It has everything to attract everyone, men or women!  Action, romance, laughs, everything.  Everyone plays there part well and together they make up a great movie!  I can watch this over and over, I highly recommend!
B00005JKQX|5.0|You really get to explore and understand extreme genius.  Just as Amadeus showed us the tortured mind of Mozart and Shine, a surprising story about real-life classical pianist David Helfgott, A Beautiful Mind will also be an insightful classic.<br />Russell Crowe's performance was key to the success of this movie.  Few, if any other could have brought to life the screen with such understanding of the character.  Did not know the range that this actor possesses.
B00005QZ7U|5.0|The images flourishing in Moulin Rouge have only before graced the world of animation, and we finally have a live-action movie that has all the life, movement, color, imagination, and free play that a beautiful animated feature can produce.<br />To call this movie irreverent is an understatement--we do not even question why Zidler hops and flies about like an enchanted gnat from a Disney flick.  Sure the moon can sing!  What's wrong with a pistol flying across France then striking the Eiffel Tower?  Nothing!  I don't find myself wondering, &quot;Yes, but WHY do all the people in the room suddenly know the same song and dance number?&quot;  I know to ask that of musicals is to miss the point, but musicals so often seem forced and contrived because they just cannot blend realism with the fantasy that is a musical.  Moulin Rouge never pretends to be realistic, thus, it is allowed to throw caution to the wind and overstep all boundaries.  <br />My breath catches when stars explode on the screen, when we're bombarded with a montage of images meant to tell the story, when it seems the demented Duc will catch Satine and Christian in the act of deceiving him.  I really feel for the two main characters, and it's somewhat of a wonder why--their personalities weren't terribly well developed, no more so than other characters who seemed expendable to me in other movies.  I think it is really the nuances that make them loveable.  Their glances, their giggling, the earnestness in their eyes, and their chemistry culminate in unforgettable romance.  Never once did the attraction between these two lovers seem forced.<br />The musical numbers and visuals are for the most part, completely enjoyable.  I found the duet between Zidler and the Duc a bit unnerving and weird at first, but watching it a second time, it's not quite so freaky.  It's actually a bit funny and just another reason to dislike the Duc (he's evil, therefore, he cannot sing or dance worth lick, of course).  <br />I'm sure some people found the singing tiresome and thought Kidman and McGregor were ill suited to the task of singing.  I, personally, found McGregor's voice to carry scenes amazingly, and it was full of such sincerity and emotion that I just had to love the character for his very innocence and passion.  <br />Kidman's voice was not as impressive, but she also was not given as many demanding tunes, so who really knows what she is capable of?  Regardless, she is truly, truly captivating, enchanting, and wonderful in this film.  Her flailing on the floor in a fit of poetry-inspired passion is worth the price of any ticket or DVD, and she perfectly personifies her role with her sparkling eyes, fiery cascading hair, lithe body, and porcelain skin.  She commands the screen with true presence and charisma.  She really is a &quot;Sparkling Diamond&quot; in this film.  My heart ached for her when she accepts her role in life as a caged bird, and though she's a courtesan, I never see her as a tramp, undignified, or tawdry.  I immediately sympathize with her and wish her all the success and love she so desperately tries to find in life.<br />I cried during this movie, and Christian and Satine are two truly tragic figures.  I knew a little of what to expect from this movie, but I was blown away once I finally saw it.  I understand why some people find it ridiculous, overblown, reliant on pop-culture and whatnot.  That's okay.  The movie is just not middle-of-the-road enough to please everybody, but the payoff for those who CAN appreciate it is all the more rewarding because it provides a feast for the senses and the emotions that is rarely, if ever, dared in cinema.

0393317552|4.0|In Guns, Germs &amp; Steel, Jared Diamond presents a compelling explanation for the divergence in technological development between Eurasian societies and those of Africa, Oceania and the Americas.   His central thesis is that environmental factors were the primary driving force in social evolution.   This thesis is developed through the examination of a slew of ecological factors such as the various availability of plant and animal species suitable for domestication, as well as geographical factors such as continental size and orientation, and ease of migration.  <br />Diamond's motivation is to debunk a racist explanation of history.  For that it seems sufficient to cite the different races within Eurasia that have at one point or another &quot;led&quot; in technological and political development within a time frame too short for genetic change to be the explanation.   Diamond does not extend his thesis to within Eurasia, but rather gives a brief and rather weak explanation in the epilogue that poor land use caused southwestern Asian societies to lag and accidents of politics did the same for China.<br />Diamond is not the best writer.  While necessary, the application of his thesis to each continent comes off as overly repetitious.  While this book could not have been written in the 50 pages cited in other reviews, a more compact exposition would have been welcome and perhaps would have left room for a more thorough examination of the differences in societal development within Eurasia.  None the less, Guns, Germs &amp; Steel adds greatly to the popular literature on social evolution.
0395389496|5.0|Enchanting from beginning to end. Allsburg's beautiful illustrations and wonderfully told story makes this book a must have.  Children and adults everywhere will believe in the magic.
B00005QDW1|2.0|Sigh...<br />I know that No Doubt can do better than this -- witness their previous 2 albums, which are awesome!<br />But this album is a disappointment.  The melodies are centered around a handful of notes, typically 1 octave in range, repeating ad nausea.  The lyrics are a poor excuse -- Gwen should have just hummed, and spared us the monotony.  At least half the songs consist of a SINGLE PHRASE that is repeated 20-30 times, then faded out.<br />Obviously the didn't have enough time to 1) come up with interesting lyrics, 2) come up with exciting melodies, or 3) ponder intros and endings to these songs (several of which just fade in, then fade out).  I feel like I'm listening to ELEVATOR MUZAK!  (Sorry, No Doubt -- I love your other albums, I do!)<br />Sure looks like they rushed this out for Christmas 2001, to make their record label happy.  It won't be spending much time in my CD player...
B00004Y87J|5.0|I don't know what movie the reviewers who were giving one or two stars watched, but it certainly couldn't have been Hitch's 39 Steps!!!<BR>This movie is Exciting, Hilarious, and Sexy.<BR>The Public Domain (extremely cheap) copies of CLASSICS such as this one are NEVER, EVER, EVER worth a dime! Good sound and picture quality are a MUST to get the most enjoyment out of this wonderful comedy-mystery.
B00005LC4B|4.0|I Love This Movie! I Truly Do..But I Cant Help But Wonder Why The Makers Behind This Film Just Let It Go To The Birds In The Final Act. Seriously, A Very Tense Film Indeed, Up Until The Unbelievable, Yet Some-What Entertaining, Finale. I Am A Huge Fan Of Juliette Lewis Who Snagged An Oscar Nod For Her Roll, But They Should Have Changed The Ending, For It Just Doesnt Fit Into The Rest Of The Movie. I Dont Mean To Spoil It, But I Would Have Liked To See DeNiro's Character's Demise Be A Bit More Tense, Than Just Sinking To The Bottom Of A River (Cape Fear). All In All, A Tense, Entertaining, Visually Captivating, And Beautifully Acted By All, Except That DeNiro's Performance Does Veir Towards Parody At Some Unintentionally Laughable Moments, But It Just Doesnt Work. As I Said, Better Ending With More Tension And Less Focus On DeNiro &amp; His Ego By Having His Character Max Cady Go Down Like A Hero.
0553712837|1.0|Shame on you, John Grisham and on Doubleday as well!  With  A TIME TO KILL you proved you could write something besides cookie-cutter courtroom thrillers.  And even though that book is heavily dependent on legal drama, it is a riveting character-driven page-turner about the rage that consumes a father when his daughter is savagely attacked.  SKIPPING CHRISTMAS is a cheap shot to capture seasonal dollars, obviously rushed to press in November, and so shoddily printed that the headers are unevenly spaced, sometimes touching the edge of the page, and the print is almost too pale to read without strong light.  With a lot of work, SKIPPING CHRISTMAS might have made a mediocre short story, but it is a terrible novel, crammed with too many characters and dependent on the totally unbelievable premise that a woman as generally &quot;together&quot; as Nora Krank would lie to her daughter and then scurry for hours to make truth of the lie; you give short shrift to the daughter's brusque actions and lack of common courtesy.  You rely on every clich&eacute; about Christmas, including drunken office brawls, thoughtless gifts, meaningless Christmas cards, commercialization, and crass symbols such as Frosty the Snowman.  You try to redeem the rudeness of the neighbors and the many weaknesses of the plot by wrapping everything in a big red bow at the end of the book, but gift-wrapped garbage is still garbage.  I can't believe you need the money, so why did you do this to your readers?  Even more important, why did you do it to yourself???
B00005JKQX|5.0|At the end of the movie, a lot of people stood up and clapped.  Although, I wasn't among the ones standing and clapping, I agreed with their sentiments.  It was a &quot;beautiful&quot; film.  I laughed, I cringed, I got teary eyed, and I cheared.  Russell Crowe and Ed Harris are sure to be nominated for an Oscar for their respective roles.  This movie is definitely worth the money and two and half hours.  I never read the book and I don't plan to but I'd definitely see the movie again.
6305513406|4.0|There's nothin' like a little classic `Trek to fill my need for quasi-cheesy space opera hijinks. And where better to start than at the very beginning? <br />\\"Where No Man... \\" introduces Kirk, Sulu, &amp; Scotty to the Star Trek universe. It's filled with other notable firsts as well, including the first Shatnerian halting, staccato, heavy-handed monologue as Jimmers is being tortured by his former first officer who's using his newfound telekinetic powers to claim dominion over his former shipmates. Although this show marked his only appearance on `Trek, Gary Lockwood eventually found a way to double his sci-fi convention revenues thanks to his being cast in another classic space iliad a few years later. And let's not forget the first signature Kirkian fight sequence, as well as Jimmers' first ripped uniform top that shows off his not-so-ripped left shoulder &amp; chest! Okay, so maybe Shatner's display of bare flesh ain't nearly as gratuitous here as it was in `Big Bad Mama' (come to think of it, NONE of `em were!), but, um... where am I going with this? Absolutely nowhere, that's where! Which means it's time to move on the next eppie on this disc...<br />`The Corbomite Maneuver' was the proper introduction of Dr. McCoy  (the network wasn't showing the episodes in the actual order they were filmed, so this wasn't his first official appearance BUT!...), as well as his second-most-famous (paraphrased) catchphrase,  \\"What am I, a doctor, or...?\\" Also new to the scene is Uhura, that sultry goddess of the Enterprise communications console, and Yeoman Rand! As most males of the Trekkie Nation will tell you, hailing frequencies ain't the ONLY things that are open whenever these ladies put in their screen time! Strangely enough, Uhura debuts wearing a yellow miniskirt uniform here. Fortunately, the higher-ups in the costume department noticed that she looked much better in red!<br />Also making one of his earliest appearances here is the false Balok. Actually, it's his only appearance, save for his image showing up as part of the background stills in the closing credits of almost every original `Trek show! He's also been part of a few practical jokes performed by Gene Roddenberry on the show's writers. Then there's the real Balok, played by Clint Howard, who's almost as scary-looking as his false alter-ego!  No wonder big brother Richie- whoops, I mean, Opie- whoops, I mean, Ron throws him small roles in the flicks he directs! Might as well face facts: Clint just ain't got that `leading man' look...<br />`Late
B00005OM4N|2.0|I'll be honest with you, sometimes when im in the mood ill dance to Britney in my room, but thats it. What it comes down to is that her music is fun and puts you in a good mood, but she has zero talent. If i had been taking dance since i was born and had a full staff to work on my body, hair and makeup I could be jsut as good. Her voice is awful, and though her music is fun, she didn't write and she doesnt sing it well, she jsut looks pretty faking it. dont waste your money on this cd, just listen to I'm A slave FOR (not 4...i Hate when people do that) You, its only on every five minutes!
B00005RHGK|3.0|Jeepers Creepers gets an A for origionality. I liked the fact that I hadnt seen this plot before recycled from another film. I also liked the monster. He was a real bad ... But that is where the train gets de-railed. The film was just porely executed. And the main characters were hands down THE DUMBEST KIDS IN HORROR FILM HISTORY. They do EVERYTHING a sane person wouldnt do. I was insulted at the stupidity of these ... <br />Now we get to the ending of the film. I wont spoil it for anyone who wants to see it but...........WHAT THE HECK HAPPENED????? Jeepers Creepers has the strangest ending of all time. It boggles the mind.
B00005OAIE|5.0|I bought this cd based on a friend's reccomendation, which I usually don't do. But I'm so glad I did. I usually listen to Dispatch, Pat Mcge, Dave and Guster, and I think this CD is as good if not better than any of theirs. It's interesting music with great melodies and lyrics, but my favorite part is his incredible, original, raspy voice.  I havent put this CD away since i bought it!
B000002IOY|3.0|...  This isn't junk and it's not pure gold either.  It's rather good '80's thrash, but a little dated sounding in many ways and a bit repetitive here and there.  Overkill's choruses in particular tend to involve shouting the song title over and over.  Nothing wrong with that always, but it's a bit formulaic.<br />Still, this is pretty good stuff.
B00003W8NM|5.0|At first glance in the video store or rental place this film may look dumb because a person might think it is just about a stupid fight club.  This is not so, yes there is a fight club in the film as the title implies, but the film is much more than that.  It raises questions about how we as a people judge ourselves in society.  The film talks about how we are just a bunch of self-centered consumers who judge ourselves by the contents of our wallets.  If you can get past a little blood and gore and actually look into the film you will see a must have for any DVD collection.
B00005MP58|5.0|This is my favorite movie of all time.  I love the story because it is about how love is more important than society's boundaries and also about how two people can fall in love even if at one time one of them high disliked the other. It's a very special movie and is very true to the book, almost exactly. I highly recommend that you see it at least once in your life.
0064471837|5.0|This is one of the best books I have ever read in my life. I got it for christmas, and was done with it the next day! The moment I opened it, I couldn't put it down, it was the most captivating book I've ever read. I already have a friend of wanting to read it because I won't stop talking about it, I would recomend this book to anyone who wants a good read!
B00005JKES|2.0|To the guy who defended this box set by saying those who complained should shut up and buy it on ebay:  what world are you living on?  When people buy a box set stating that it's the first season, WE EXPECT THE WHOLE THING!  Why not subtitle it with FIRST SEASON MISSING PILOT!  nowhere on the box does it even STATE this.  <br />BE WARNED!
B00005JKES|5.0|This is a superb DVD-set. A must-have for all Twin Peaks afficionados. I already had the UK-release on videotape, but these were extremely poor quality. I could not believe my eyes when I saw it was getting a re-release on DVD. The image-quality is outstanding and far better than any DVD-release of any tv-show before (much better than X-Files or the Sopranos), the sound is awesome. I especially love the DTS-soundtrack.<br />Of course a lot of people are (understandably) upset about the missing Pilot episode. However, I did find it (on DVD) at scarecrow.com. I have ordered it, but not yet received it, so I am not too sure this is the real deal.<br />The only thing which puzzles me, is the fact that only 7 episodes are in season 1. In the Netherlands, where I live, the first season stopped when the killer was discovered. The second season over here was the Windom Earle-season. If there were only two seasons, the second season must have had many more episodes than the first one.<br />The special features on the 7th disc are also quite cool, which some nice interviews with the old cast-members.
B00005R62K|5.0|This is one of my favourite discs by Judas Priest. It includes new drummer Les Binks, who is superb. Stained Class contains excellent songs, great musicianship and thought-provoking lyrics. Thank goodness the lyrics are finally available, now I know what is being sung. I do wish that CBS would have included more bonus tracks(At least 4 would have been nice)when they took on this remastering overhaul. Sound quality has been improved over the original with the guitars having better presence. Drums are cleaner as well. The bonus tracks are fine but the first one 'Fire Burns Below', is a bit strange for a Priest song, definitely an outake. Vocals are excellent as usual reminding me a lot of 'Sad Wings Of Destiny' in their delivery. A must-have for the Priest fan.
B00005JKMO|2.0|Being female, and not a boxing fan, this is the last type of movie I would have expected to go and see-- much less like, especially with all the other movies opening at this time.  However, I truly believed that Will Smith would have given a great performance.  i can say in all honesty that he far surpassed my expectations.  This is probably the best acting vehicle he has been in, and he carried the role off to perfection.  The boxing scenes were so realistic, I felt that I was ringside.  Another surprise was Jon Voight as Howard Cosell!  I don't believe anyone could have played him more believably and realistically as Voight.  For me, the movie was also an education, as it presented a culture of which I have no knowledge.  <br />This move draws one in with all senses, and each sense is completely satisfied. <br />I remember as a teen when Ali refused the draft. At that time I felt he had let down the nation with his unpatriotic action and words.  After seeing this movie, I was compelled by his strength of belief, and walked away with nothing but admiration for him.  <br />The movie ends with the &quot;Rumble in the Jungle&quot;.  I do wish that it had told more of his later life, but realize that there was no time for it.  Perhaps a sequel.......
B00005QDW1|5.0|When I first got this CD, I was disappointed, I was hoping for the classic No Doubt Ska/Reggae sound.  But in this album, they went more along the lines of Return to Saturn with an techno/pop sound.  The lyrics are MUCH MORE secular than the personal odes Gwen wrote in Tragic Kingdom and RoS.  But still, Gwen delievers powerful emotions with every line she sings.<br />If you didn't like &quot;Hey Baby&quot; don't worry, it's probably the worst song on the CD.  This album puts the 80's to shame.  The songs are full of great hooks, so they never get boring.  <br />Tony Kanal should have his head examined for dumping Gwen!!  I want her so bad!
B000002KKS|5.0|I never liked sabbath only for one reason because of Ozzy, lets be quite honest Ozzy cant sing at all, im not saying you cant like him but he cant. He has no good vocal range and he doesnt sing with heart at all, as for Dio being the legend he is, well can sing. And I wouldnt look at dio as an evil man, actually Dio is very religious with christian beliefs,yet is still the King of Rock&Roll. He just portrays the themes of good and evil in his own perspective which in my opinion is outstanding,. The band is in top form all of them.<BR>Kneon Knights-Great opening song, fast raw and intense, Dios vocals are outstanding.<BR>Children of the damned-really cool song, the opening acoustic is great. The lyrics are killer its just an extraordinary song, and yes its kind of like children of the grave feel.<BR>Lady Evil-The opening bass and drums is the best thing in this song, the lyrics are kind of funny, but interesting. Also very good solo.<BR>Heaven and hell-A classic, everyhting on this song is extraordinary. The lyrics,guitar,drums best of all the bass. Talk about some killer riffs. The drive of this whole song is extraordinary dio sings his heart out.<BR>Wishing Well-Its a good jamming song, you really have to be in the mood to hear it though. Has a very cool catchy chorus.<BR>Die Young-great one, the opening keyboards with clean lead guitar is great, this song is really awesome. And towards the end they really start to jam.<BR>Walk Away-the bass is great on this one again goes awesome with the guitar, its a cool song. Some odd lyrics though like when he says Lord shes handsome. Still its really cool.<BR>Lonely is the word-The lyrics are outstanding, and it has a good opening and a good closing for the album. A major rock/blues song.<BR> Its a great album, Tony Iomii is one of the greatest guitarists of all time as well as geezer butler being an extraordinary bassist. Highly distorted, and very smooth, even Bill Ward being my least favorite for sabbath I must say he does a damn good job on the drums well he really just flows with the songs well, and Dio is just soaring as he always is, but people quit talking bad about Dio, and realize he did amazing with sabbath, get this album if your a Dio fan as well.
B000001G5A|4.0|This performance of Mozart's legendary Requiem holds a special place among countless other Requiem recordings.<br />Karl Bohm's directing makes this piece very vibrant and alive - emotional and elaborate, as reflected in the rather slow tempos chosen throughout the movements. The solo performers and orchestra are all very involved and create a marvelous tapestry of music. When it's all put together, the Requiem radiates in the religious aura it deserves.<br />The recording (audio-wise) is very warm and detailed - the organ portions are particularly alive, which is something lacking in many recordings.<br />All in all, it's definitely a good buy for anyone interested in owning an excellent interpretation of Mozart's Requiem.
B00000BKE0|5.0|There is not one thing possibly wrong with this album,it is very heavy and very raw adding Jannick's sock em guitar. I will always defend Jannick Gers because it is a fact that he is an outstanding guitarist and just as good if not better then Adrian, however people just wont except the fact that the band had to move on right after the golden years with Smith. The production is quite excellent,thr timing and capability is terrific and all of the songs flow very smooth together. Dave and Jannick are outstanding together, 2 solid heavy metal guitarist, with steves clean lightning striking bass and songwriting,also Nicko's drums, this might just be Nickos best drumwork, and Bruce Dickinson's vocals have never been so raw on an album, its utterly breathtaking how he sings.<br />Tailgunner-If people are going to call this an aces high wannabe, then you might as well call aces high a where eagles dare wannabe, oh but you wont because that was in the early 80s.Besides this song has a different story talking abt. WW II and is so outstanding, very raw, everything is catchy on it too.<br />Holy Smoke-Great fun, hilariously done, the lyrics are so true. Talk abt. some major jamming, its a really fun maiden song and the guitar work on this is just outstandingly awesome.<br />No Prayer for the Dying-Very beautiful song, some of steve harris's best lyrics ever, the opening smooth lead is very intense, and when they start jamming in the middle of the song it gets very heavy and very surprising. Why anyone would consider this a weak track is beyond me, its just very smooth.<br />Public enemy #1-Great tune, fast and cool, steve's bass is just incredible how he makes it talk, and some of the best lyrics ever written again.<br />Fates warning-Great opener and Jannick's smooth lead solo in the beginning of the song is quite impressive, then when the jamming comes in its great, another great song abt. armageddon, and the way bruce sings the chorus is awesome.<br />The assassin-Very cooltune, the bass sound is very neat, it sort of reminds me of killing is my business abit. Jannick holds the solo quite well and makes it a very mean one at that, also Bruce sings this with very intense vocals like he did on De-javu, of course how the chorus is sung on this is awesome too.<br />Run silent, run deep-this is not a weak track at all, awesome lyrics based upon a killer war movie, jannick's solo in this kind of reminds me of his solo on the song dive,dive,dive from tattooed millionaire, as well as daves surprising guitar solo its quite striking then at the end of the song, its awesome to hear bruce's clean vocals with the clean guitar riff.<br />Hooks in you-an awesome wicked love song, the chorus again is sung very cool, this song is alot of fun to listen too.<br /><BR>Bring your daughter to the slaughter-A classic horror metal song, with an awesome solo by jannick and why anyone doesnt like this song is because thr just telling themselves its bad cause its Jannick playing it, everything in this song is perfect & is a maiden,metal classic, just listen too it.<br />Mother russia-Ahh a very cool political typeof song, the opening russian anthem riff is very cool with the cool sounding keyboards, it really fits the mood, and in the middle of the song the mid melody is quite lavishing, and this is a cool song for anyone who enjoys songs about politics.<br />All in all its a great album and has the great maiden sound minus all the synthesizers and tons of keyboards just a few keyboards, its alot like killers,powerslave and even a bit of 7th son. Well everyone wake up and realize what a great album this really is and is of course one of maiden's best. Please people really listen and see how awesome it is. <BR>UP THE IRONS!!!
B000001G5H|5.0|Chopin's Etudes are very complex piano pieces; this recording gives you the chance to appreciate them in the perfect masterful rendition of Maurizio Pollini. It's truly amazing to listen this recording for the first time - hearing the virtuoso pieces unravel in a blizt of intense, powerful storm of piano music. <br />Chopin's Etudes give us a glimpse into the way he, as a composer, explored the capabilities of his favourite instrument, the piano. The Etudes aren't the most delicate, raffined Chopin compositions.. But heck, they sure are energetic, enlightening, and Chopinistic!<br />This recording proves to be a &quot;must-have&quot; for Pollini fans, piano students, and piano lovers in general. Highly recommended to anyone familiar with Chopin's work, but not these particular pieces - they're a discovery to be heard and enjoyed time and time again!
B00005QZWI|5.0|With the release of the new film, &quot;Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring&quot;, the first part of a three-part epic, a great story has finally been brought to the screen. But among the fine acting, fantastic story, and lush visuals comes an equally magnificent music score. One would expect such an epic to be composed by John Williams, James Horner, Jerry Goldsmith, or Danny Elfman. So I was a little hesitant to find that composer Howard Shore was called to the task of creating the musical background to one of the greatest stories of our time. My anticipation and hesitancy were rewarded with this: a wonderful and complex music score.<br />To start off, the score perfectly captures the scope and scale of this richly created world. The music carries the listener along with the tale, and you can close your eyes and imagine the magic and terrors of Middle-Earth. The score has many beautiful themes that are woven into the tapestry of the story.<br />The CD opens with &quot;The Prophecy&quot;, a dark majestic piece that concerns the creation of the One Ring and the defeat of the Dark Lord Sauron. It is a great lead-in to the story. It is followed by &quot;Concerning Hobbits&quot;, a happy little tune that captures the essence of the happy lives of the hobbits in the Shire. From there we move into darker territory with &quot;The Shadow of the Past&quot;, which introduces the dark, gothic chanting theme for the Ringwraiths. It is a powerful, exciting theme that grows and recurrs through later tracks. &quot;The Treason of Isengard&quot; develops the theme for the Fellowship. With the tracks for &quot;The Black Rider&quot;, &quot;At the Sign of the Prancing Pony&quot;, &quot;A Knife In the Dark&quot;, and &quot;Flight To The Ford&quot;, the Ringwraiths'theme occurs as the fearsome dark riders pursue Frodo on his quest to destroy the One Ring. &quot;Many Meetings&quot; and &quot;The Council of Elrond&quot; develop the deepening of the characters' relationships as the Fellowship is formed. The soundtrack further develops the Fellowship theme as the companions continue their trek in &quot;The Ring Goes South&quot;, &quot;A Journey In The Dark&quot;, and &quot;The Bridge of Khazad Dum&quot;. These slowly grow darker as the Fellowship must battle their own fears as well as the monsterous creatures that dwell in the Mines of Moria. After the exciting and tragic ending of &quot;The Bridge of Khazad Dum&quot;, we journey into quieter, more tragic music with touches of heroism in, &quot;Lothlorien&quot;, &quot;The Great River&quot;, and &quot;Amon Hen&quot;. Finally, the soundtrack comes to a close with &quot;The Breaking of the Fellowship&quot;, a piece that is very sad even though it has an underlying sense of hope. It bleeds directly into &quot;May It Be&quot;, another soft tragic piece that then builds to a climactic rendition of the Fellowship theme.<br />The CD is brilliant. Howard Shore's music is both quiet and overpowering, happy and tragic, heroic and menacing. But it is always majestic and it is always exciting. It goes right up there with the John Williams's scores for &quot;Star Wars&quot; films. <br />If you loved the Lord of the Rings books and movie, or if you just love movie scores, then you'll really enjoy this soundtrack. It perfectly captures the magic and grandeur of the most epic adventure of all time. Definitlely worth getting!! I can hardly wait for the next two films, and the next two soundtracks, to see what Howard Shore has in store for us, as he continues the epic and brings the story to a magnificent close.
B000001GXB|5.0|Pollini's rendition of the late Beethoven sonatas is breathtaking. His mastership of the piano is truly displayed in this very powerful, top-notch performance. These rather difficult piano sonatas are rendered in such radiant beauty that one simply cannot resist longing for more - very energetic playing that never lets the attention wander off.<br />Additionally, the recording is very detailed and precise, possessing a superb sound stage that surpasses even late digital recordings. This only makes the recording even more pleasant to listen to.<br />Overall; definitely a must-have for any piano-piece enthousiast, Beethoven-iens, and Pollini-iens alike!
B00003CXRP|5.0|Just in a few words, Another Tom Hanks great!! A very moving story, rent or buy this one you'll see what I mean. Someday way in the future we'll look back on all the great actors of this century and Tom Hanks will be one of the greatest!
B00005QCYD|2.0|My issues with this movie involve its relationship to the source material. What a movie they could have made had they stuck to the spirit of the video game. Why didn't they--wasn't the game a success? And what made it a success--the design, the feel, the character of Lara Croft as originally concieved, that's what.The movie is SO not the game that they might just as well have named it Georgia Jones and the Temple Of Doom. The game makers carefully created a world and a character to dwell within it: a cool light intriguing arena with a compact sexy protagonist. She confronts a series of challenges with quick ingenuous single minded perseverence. Now comes this clamoring corporate cinematic contraption. Angelina Jolie's presence is sultry and inner dwelling and somewhat passive, which is good in itself but misses the steel trap reflexiveness of the original character creation completely. Also, the video character seemed to be of indeterminate race, only partly white. Then they ladle on the paranormal new age back story. Worst of all, Jolie is rarely more than a few yards from good and bad men for the run of the flick, even if the film makers have to drag out her dead father to gaze upon her her supple flesh. She's never allowed to act out the original character's calling--to get into and out of a series of delimas ALL BY HERSELF, as a strong resourceful modern young woman. The &quot;real&quot; Lara Croft is a sleek sexy problem solver, not some smoulderingly sensual pampered history sleuth with oedipal yearnings and an over-endowed, lanky body.They missed their chance to make an intiguing, virtually dialogue free masterpiece. THAT movie is still waiting to be made, maybe by a young director and cast with no money but lots of talent and the capacity to be inspired.
B000003S5H|4.0|This is one of the first CDs I pop in my stereo when I'm just chilling in my room and I'm in a mellow mood. It's very pleasant and enjoyable. I'd say &quot;Moon Safari&quot; is a very aptly titled album. My only problem is track 3, &quot;All I Need&quot;. I just think it's a bad song (one of the few tracks on the album that can be called a song) and goes against the general &quot;spacey&quot; theme of the album as a whole. &quot;Sexy Boy&quot; is an obvious standout. &quot;La Femme d'Argent&quot; and &quot;Talisman&quot; are excellent as well. If you're like me and enjoy a wide spectrum of tempos and atmospheres in your music collection, then pick up &quot;Moon Safari&quot; and add it to the lighter side of that spectrum. You will like it.
B00005JKT8|4.0|This film has been getting pretty tepid (to worse) reviews, so I went expecting to enjoy Hugh Jackman (as always) but with less than glowing expectations about the rest of the film.  I was pleasantly surprised.  The entire ensemble works well together, the film has many moments of charm and humor, and (despite a few logical leaps of faith) it doesn't insult one's intelligence.  This isn't deep, it isn't &quot;art,&quot; and it's not going to win any Oscars.  But you're not going to feel like you wasted your $8.50, either.  (And yes, Hugh is great.  But what he REALLY needs is a Gladiator-type role to break out -- he was BORN to play hunky, conflicted epic heroes.)
B000003TBP|5.0|Some day when my kids ask &quot;So dad, what was music like in the 90s?&quot; I'm just gonna throw in Beck and be like &quot;Here, listen to this.&quot; Think about it though. Over Odelay's 13 tracks, Beck Hansen demonstrates the essence of both rock and pop that was the 90s.<br />With an impressive array of instrumentation and pure, nonsensical lyrical fun Beck really pushes the envelope and explores relatively unchartered ground. I also appreciate his diversity of rock, pop, a little techno and definitely some country tones on some tracks. Admittedly, his experimentation isn't always the greatest but surprisingly it usually is. It is rare for musicians to be as daring and experimental as Beck yet still succeed as a mainstream artist. This is why I feel he can truly be called one of the greatest artists of the 90s.<br />Beck's versatility + groundbreaking sounds + lyrical craftsmanship + 5 years and still good = 5 stars.
0446608955|5.0|I am not someone who can say that I read a lot.  I enjoy reading but rarely find a book that truly speaks to me.  But I can honestly say that this book did just that.  This is the best book I have ever read, and I have read several.  I couldn't put it down.  I read the entire book the day I bought it.  It is well written, touching, riveting... I could go on and on.  I recommend this book to all.. young and old.  It speaks to the heart and you hear every word loud and clear.  I love this book so much that I think I will read it again tomorrow!
B0000508U6|4.0|If there's one band to keep your eye on, it is Coldplay. Their 10-track debut has me craving for more. These guys are good! The sound of the album is incredible. It's like the music is soaring yet on the ground at the same time. Nevermind, that sounds stupid. Well, listen to the album. Hopefully you'll have an idea of what I mean. <br />Chris Martin's voice is unique. It's not Dave Matthews. It's not David Gray. It's not Thom Yorke. It reminds you of all 3 at different points but it's unique in it's own right. The lyrics are infectious. At times you'll swear the guitar riffs were stolen from Radiohead's &quot;The Bends&quot; or &quot;OK Computer&quot;. Whether they were or not, they are very good.<br />&quot;Yellow&quot;, being the big hit off the album, is an obvious standout. Other personal favorites are &quot;Don't Panic&quot;, &quot;Spies&quot;, and &quot;Trouble&quot;. Starting with &quot;Parachutes&quot;, the end of the album is notably slower and less &quot;radio-friendly&quot;. Still excellent songs though. There is one glaring weak track: &quot;Sparks&quot;. It sounds like the band got really bored one day and made that tenth track to fill out the album. Perhaps being sandwiched between the marvelous &quot;Spies&quot; and &quot;Yellow&quot; hurts it even more. In any case, with that one exception, the music on this CD is refreshingly well done and deserves to be bought by any music lover.<br />Also, I could've gone for a couple more tracks of this caliber. So, only 10 tracks + 1 disappointing track = 4 stars. There you have it. Superior work Coldplay!
0446310786|5.0|Harper Lee opens the pressing issue of discrimination through the eyes of an innocent child in a small southern town.<BR>Harper Lee tells the story of a young girl growing up in a small town where she witnesses the discrimination of race, gender, and class through everyday happenings in her town.  The reader is moved to ponder the reasons for prejudice as the main character, Scout, does when the results of racism cause the death of an innocent man.  The characters interest the reader and the events make the reader think about important life situations faced by people every day.
B00004ZAV3|3.0|With 27 tracks, I would've changed so many track selections on this CD. Sure, everyone has a couple personal favorites that missed the boat. But what about &quot;Twist and Shout&quot; and &quot;Strawberry Fields&quot;. Those are timeless Beatles tracks. <br />I'm also a fan of the Beatles later, less &quot;poppy&quot; work which I don't feel was adequately represented by this collection. Too many annoying early songs. Perhaps I had to be alive in the 60s to truly appreciate those. <br />The Beatles + 27 tracks - some poor selections - poor quality versions = 3 stars.
B00004Z459|5.0|I have to say I have never heard a CD like this. It is a hard rock album, but probably one of the only hard rock CDs in the world that features ABSOLUTELY NO CUSSING. The only thing is, most of the songs are unutterably depressing. I also think Chester Bennington has one of THE best voices I have ever heard. <br />&quot;Papercut&quot; is one of the best on the album. it has excellent guitar riffs and not-so-original lyrics, but overall I love this song, especially when it makes its transition from rapping and awesome guitar parts to Chester's great, darker bridge.<BR>&quot;One Step Closer&quot;, once again, has awesome guitars, and a great melody. I also love the oh-so-true lyrics. The video, I thought, doesn't quite match the song; I don't picture this track to have demonic people walking around the band while LP plays this track. This song was great, though.<BR>&quot;With You&quot; has some of those great turntables, and also a fabulous melody. I especially like the bridge (&quot;No matter how far we've come...&quot;) and I, once again, notice Chester's excellent vocals. Another good song.<BR>&quot;Points of Authority&quot; is...different. The beginning spoken part doesn't really have much depth, but it sure is catchy. I wouldn't really like this song if it weren't for the unforgettable melody.<BR>&quot;Crawling&quot; is the darkest song on the album, which is saying something. LP is hard rock, but not dark hard rock, which is a bit of a revolution. This song starts out with great guitar, again, and wonderful vocals and lyrics. I was amazed to see Chester go from his amazing, soft voice to his loud screaming. I think he sounds great both ways, though. This song is one of the best, even though I usually skip it as I like the faster tracks myself.<BR>&quot;Runaway&quot; is a strange song, if you listen to it. It talks about the sad topic of running away (duh) when nobody understands you. Again, the transition from soft to loud was remarkable.<BR>&quot;By Myself&quot; is not such a good song. I think it's catchy and the lyrics are decent, but it lacks depth and some actual effort.<BR>&quot;In the End&quot; is by far one of the best songs on the album. Quite depressing, if you really listen to it, but it rules. Chester's little solo, once again from soft to loud, is amazing. I love this song, word for word, note for note.<BR>&quot;A Place for My Head.&quot; I started laughing when I heard the beginning, Spanish-influenced guitar. But when I listened to the rest of it, I was a little disappointed with the boring lyrics, but the guitar part is excellent. An ok song.<BR>&quot;Forgotten&quot; starts out with loud screaming followed by just the opposite, off and on. Then it goes into a slower, more mellow feel, then back to the screaming/almost-singing/screaming/almost-singing/screaming/almost-singing. This song lacks depth as well, but it is amazing in its melody and its depressant value.<BR>&quot;Cure for the Itch&quot; is another song I always skip. It has no lyrics at all, just the turntables and some Oriental piano chords. Nothing special.<BR>&quot;Pushing Me Away&quot; is the closing and one of the best songs on the album. It is sad, but it grows on you, trust me.<br />I think this debut album is a must-have for any kind of rock fan, and you won't be sorry.
B00005QEO2|5.0|I won't mention all the songs because anyone reading this already knows how awsome they are!  I will let you all know that this CD is one of the best mastered discs(X2) I've ever had the pleasure of listening to, it's mastered at 96khz and 24-bit.  The LIVE songs are SO GOOD!  I've never been a big fan of live recordings due to quality issues, but this album is definitly an exception!!
B000001Y79|5.0|After hearing this CD, I became a huge ND fan. This is their best album so far. The first 10 tracks are the ones I can listen to straight through, but I usually go from 1-4 to 9-10, then skip to 14. &quot;Spiderwebs&quot; is really hard to play, trust me. My band is trying to learn to play a cover of it, and it's taking us forever. &quot;Excuse Me Mr.&quot;...well, I dont like the topic, but I love this song. &quot;Just A Girl&quot; shows Gwen Stefani's awesome vocal talent, and great guitar playing. &quot;Happy Now?&quot; is excellent. A sort of edgy feel, it doesn't get much better. &quot;Sunday Morning&quot; is another of my favorites. When I realized the whole first part was bass, I was impressed. If I tried to play that, it would be almost like a slow-mo version! &quot;Don't Speak&quot; is timeless. Sad, but it is all about the memories. &quot;Tragic Kingdom&quot; is one of the best on the CD. I love the beginning spoken part, and the sax solos. All in all, this CD is one of the best in the decade, and you have to get it! I'm sure most have it already, but if you don't...what are you waitin for?!?!
B00005QDW1|5.0|You must buy this absolutely perfect album! I can't imagine living without this breath-taking master piece! I'm from France<BR>and i've been waiting for this album, which has been produced by<BR>geniuses! Each track is pretty fantastic, i mean jewels, oysters,eh... Hey baby and in my head remind me of The pixies and<BR>prokofiev: Imagination, high creativity and, moreover, Gwen has a sublime voice, she truly describes what we can feel about love and happinness. Every victim of the 11 september's catastroph should listen to this album , to smile again!
B00003CXAA|5.0|Abetted by director Francis Ford Coppola's engaging audio commentary, \\"The Godfather DVD Collection\\" remains a must-have for any cinema aficionado, even though Robert Duvall's presence is sorely missed during the underrated third installment.  Marlon Brando, Al Pacino, James Caan, John Cazale and Robert De Niro deliver classic performances in Coppola's absorbing crime trilogy, which still packs a powerful punch.  The supplementary materials on Disc 5 are excellent, particularly the deleted scenes and Academy Award acceptance speeches.
B00003CXZ4|5.0|I saw the DVD 3 times over the course of 2 days and each time I saw it, the richness and sheer genius of execution becomes more and more apparent. This is probably one of the most tightly crafted films I've seen in years. The performances, especially from Pearce are nothing short of astonishing. This is ensemble acting at its absolute best with completely flawless direction and razor-sharp script. This is a desert-island film to keep and view periodically.
B00005QZ7U|5.0|...this was the most engaging movie of 2001. Sadly, too many people just didn't get it.<br />It's not about the (conventional) story, it's not about the (pop) music, or (amateur) singers, it's not about the (flashy) scenery and costumes, it's not even about the (dizzying) editing.<br />It's drama, it's camp, it's a musical for heaven's sake! It's about a combination of incongruous elements that have never been combined in such a magical way before--and it's about HEART, all heart. For God's sake, let go and love it!
B000021YQV|5.0|Awsome cd...almost evry song is worth listening to...prison song,pogo,and chop suey are all realy good.

B000002LOE|3.0|Out of Time is often called the best REM album, but I disagree with this. Apart from Losing My Religion, which is one of my favourite songs ever, the album is not up to some of REM's other offerings. It's still a good album, with happy pop-rock melodic songs like `Radio Song' and `Shiny Happy People' and more depressed songs like the simple but effective `Low' but there is some filler, like `Near Wild Heaven' and `Me In Honey'. I suggest Automatic for the People as a better starting point for newcomers, as well as Monster and Up as looks into the more rocky (Monster) and experimental (Up) REM.

0425163407|3.0|I've read a few &quot;Kay Scarpetta&quot; books, but this one was a disappointment. The characters were interesting enough and the search for the killer using the forensic evidence was fascinating as usual.

B00005JKES|4.0|I loved Twin Peaks, and it's about time they put the series on DVD. However, I was very dissappointed that the pilot was not included in this set.  In response to one reviewer's suggestion to buy on eBay, I want to say, \\"I HAVE the pilot on vhs.  I recorded the entire series!\\"  I want the DVD.  I may be able to buy some hack copy on ebay, but that isn't what I want.  I want a high quality respectable DVD...of THE PILOT.  I want it all on DVD from the moment the magic started.  Honestly, I think the same whipsmart team that has taken 5 years to release the DVD's of Buffy in the USA must be on this project, as well. If it is common knowlegde that one shops on eBay to buy illegal copies you think someone would GET THE CLUE.  WE ARE WILLING TO PAY. PILOT NOW!
B00005QDW1|3.0|THe sound is very different.  I'm an old-time No Doubt fan so I wasn't at all impressed with this cd.  It has nothing on Tragic Kingdom. It's not terrible, but I definitely prefer the old No Doubt.  Hey Baby is the funnest track on the whole alblum.  If you didn't like it, I doubt you'll be impressed with the rest of the alblum.  I am certaintly not impressed, but it's okay.  Not nearly as good as their old stuff, but I'm still a No Doubt fan.
B00004XOWM|2.0|Perhaps the best track on this album is \\"Hot Dog,\\" the first track after the intro and thus first taste of new Limp Bizkit that fans have been waiting for since the summer 1999 release of \\"Significant Other.\\" Unfortunately, \\"Hot Dog\\" greatly disappoints as a powerful Limp guitar riff is spoiled with lyrics mocking Nine Inch Nails and lyrics stolen from Insane Clown Posse. The album goes downhill from there, as the vocals are about as moving and creative as poetry written by a 8th grader. At least it seems that Fred Durst identifies with prepubescent fans, as he seems to stick up for the angry suburban little league player as he demands respect for \\"his generation\\" from parental figures in \\"My Generation.\\" High points of the album are \\"Hold On,\\" a mellow yet powerful song, and the \\"Urban Assault Vehicle\\" version of \\"Rollin.\\" Of course, the beauty of \\"Hold On\\" lies with the lyrical mastery of Stone Temple Pilots frontman Scott Weiland, who embarrassingly outshines Durst. The Urban Assault Vehicle version of \\"Rollin\\" is a high point because it perfectly blend what the Bizkit is best at-- a mix of rap and metal packaged into a pop song. DMX, Redman and Method Man deliver strong verses, allthough it is painful to listen to them work alongside someone as devoid of talent as Fred Durst. Throughout the album Limp Bizkit continues to perfect their rap-metal hybrid genre they defined with Significant Other. Unfortunately, this time around Durst seems more concerned with keeping as many tracks possible available to the pop culture TRL/MTV crowd, as his lyrics are primarily weak catch phrases, only partially redeemed by the quality guitar, bass, turntable, and drum work.
B00003CXZ4|5.0|Christopher Nolan's mind-bending thriller \\"Memento\\" is one of those rare instances in which the form of a movie is designed to match its content.  Here is a film all about the nature of short-term memory, which, by its own ingenious structure, challenges the audience to cope with its own mastery of short-term memory.<br />Guy Pearce stars as Leonard Shelby, a man who suffers from a \\"condition\\" brought on by a trauma to the head that prevents him from being able to retain any short-term memories (he can remember his life only up to the moment of his wife's rape and murder).  To cope with his affliction, Leonard writes himself copious notes, mostly on the backs of polaroids he takes on a regular basis but sometimes on his own body in the form of informational tattoos.  To approximate the sense of dislocation of time and place that Leonard feels on a daily basis - as he has to reorient himself to people and events he has recently met and since forgotten - Nolan has chosen to structure his film in a backward progression, so that the first scene ends up being the most recent and the final scene the earliest in time.  This technique is not exactly an original one, since the 1983 movie \\"Betrayal\\" used roughly the same format in the context of a romantic drama.  Still, \\"Memento\\" deserves enormous credit not only for trusting its audience to be able to cope with this complex style but for managing to keep most of the plot details well-focused and coherent for most of the film's duration.<br />One of the risks of a film like \\"Memento\\" is that it could, if handled badly, easily become a mere exercise in technical \\"gimmickry.\\"  One of the ways that Nolan avoids that trap is by devising a plot that is as gripping as any to be found in a traditionally structured example of film noir.  \\"Memento\\" is filled with the kinds of narrative twists and turns, surprise revelations and moral ambiguities that form the basis for any good example of the genre.  More important, Nolan makes Leonard a compellingly sympathetic character, one whom we come to care for because his plight is so heartrending at its core.  Here is a man who not only has to deal with the immense incomprehensibilities of his life but who cannot even benefit from the time factor that helps mourning people come to terms with the loss of a loved one.  To Leonard, his wife's death is a perpetual recent event, one from which he can never attain that emotional distance so key to finally overcoming his grief.<br />Special note should be taken of Guy Pearce, who delivers a knockout performance as Leonard, perfectly capturing the determination, frustration and emotional pain that define the character.  Carrie-Ann Moss and Joe Pantoliano offer superb support as two perpetual \\"strangers\\" who play significant roles in Leonard's strangely dislocated and fragmented life - yet just what those roles are is as much a mystery to us as it is to Leonard.

How many movies actually manage to shift our paradigm of perception and make us look anew at the way we observe the world around us?  Not many, I can assure you.<br />Christopher Nolan's brilliant and audacious cinematic tour de force reawakens our faith in the medium and those who dare to challenge it.nard a compellingly sympathetic character, one whom we come to care for because his plight is so heartrending at its core.  Here is a man who not only has to deal with the immense incomprehensibilities of his life but who cannot even benefit from the time factor that helps mourning people come to terms with the loss of a loved one.  To Leonard, his wife's death is a perpetual recent event, one from which he can never attain that emotional distance so key to finally overcoming his grief.<br />Special note should be taken of Guy Pearce, who delivers a knockout performance as Leonard, perfectly capturing the determination, frustration and emotional pain that define the character.

0812548094|1.0|This book was boring. The first few chapters kept my attention but soon I was getting tired of reading Richard and Khalan cry again and again. in fact it was rather annoying. All they seemed to do was whine which made me wonder what they were. Powerful heroes of this story plot or helpless children who feel the need to moan about everything from spilled water to death. I expected MUCH more from this book but it just turned out to be a very big dissappointment. I don't even bother to read any of Goodkind's novels anymore.
B00005PJ6M|5.0|Bill and Ted may both seem like idiots, and they are, but this film is a most lucid and hilarious exploration of Life, Death, Meaning, Evil Robots, and what it means to be a hero.  Joseph Cambell would embrace these two boneheads with all his heart.  On the surface, there are plenty of one liners and throw away jokes which, hilarious as they may be, can lead the casual virgin viewer to dismissing the movie as very funny, but at the same time stupid.  However, once you penetrate the subtlties of this movie, into the abyss you tumble, like Alice down the rabbit hole or like Augustus Gloop up the chocolate pipe.  You know what I mean.  &quot;Oh Wait, that's freshwater,&quot; &quot;Maybe if we do them girlie style,&quot; &quot;full on robot chubby&quot;- all Bogus Journey quotations that have penetrated American slang and our collective unconscious.  If you buy one DVD this year, make it this one.
0800179501|5.0|Karate Kid is not what you may think it is.  The premise of a young fatherless boy trying to survive a completely new environment is how this movie gets its humanity.  For anyone who has ever had to move to a new town, be raised by only one parent, or face overwhelming odds, and almost everyone has done at least one of these, this movie can be related to on many levels.  Ralph Macchio plays Daniel, a teenager from New Jersey who is forced to move across the country with his mother and start a new life in a foreign place, California.  Setting aside the differences between East &amp; West coast alone, there is plenty for him to realize.  When faced with bullies that he doesn't understand, he finds a friend in an unlikely place; Mr. Miagi, a Japanese handyman, played by Pat Morita, who's hides many talents.  To say Karate Kid is a story about over coming your fear is to say that life is just a thing we do everyday.  This movie mixes a friendship, a romance, a coming of age story, gaining self confidence and learning to appreciate that which you may not understand right away.  After getting sufficiently beat up by the bullies more than once, Daniel enlists the help of Miagi and soon finds himself training for a tournament.  This may seem outrageous, but Miagi knows it is a much safer place and a more controlled environment for Daniel to defend himself and gain respect.  Miagi's training techniques are unique to say the least, and just as Daniel begins to question what is going on, he realizes that Migai really does know what he is doing.  The story is good and solid and allows sympathy for both sides of the characters.  They fill a void for each other, an obvious father/son, mentor/student relationship.  The chemistry between them is very solid.  Elizabeth Shue is good in her first major role, playing the sweet rich girl who sees Daniel for the person he is and not for his social status.  Although sounding clichd on the surface, this movie is well done and not superficial.  The characters are very real, the emotions are deep and the fear of growing up with bullies hits home for many of us.  The ending will have you cheering as Daniel moves his way through the tournament to the final climatic ending.  Highly recommended and highly entertaining.
0446678430|5.0|Just got the book (on order since June!)and I dived in to it straight away. If  you liked the other books in the &quot;Rich Dad&quot; series, you are going to love this one. At first I was worried that it would be a rehash of the other books, but my fears were quickly put aside as I read on. &quot;Retire Young&quot; adds a new dimension to the information already shared in the other 3 key &quot;Rich Dad&quot; books by going in to more of the psychology of being rich. Robert shares more insights of his life - adding new levels of details to te stories we heard in the first books, plus new information on the way he and his wife have developed their fortunes from the time that they had zero.<br />This book is a MUST READ for anyone wanting to get the full impact of the &quot;Rich Dad&quot; way of being. You are left in no doubt of the things you have to stop doing -- or do more of -- in your own life in order to retire young and retire rich.
B000059Z8J|5.0|As we all know, Superman is larger than life.  He flies, he lifts battleships, he sees through walls, he protects the innocent.  He is a true American hero.  Created by immigrants in the early 20th century, Superman has been through countless recreations and revisions.  Even today, with the TV show Smallville, we are constantly trying to update and dig deeper into this character,  trying to relate to him more, and at the same time idolize him for his ideas and purity.  When Richard Donner and the Producers of this movie started working on Superman, they knew bringing this character to the screen would require a great challenge just in the realm of believability.  Getting a man to fly would be tough, and getting him to look real was going to be tougher.  The amazing thing is, Donner brought him to life in so many other ways as well.  Christopher Reeve plays the lead character with heart and purpose.  Donner made sure we felt something as this boy becomes a man and then moves on to start saving the world.  He does not stand as a chest-forward, pompous powerhouse that puts his ego or well being above anyone else.  Reeve is superb as Clark Kent and Superman.  No one could ever believe that a man who only wears glasses and slouches could hide the fact that he is the same man who dropped a boat full of bank robbers in front of the police station.  But Reeve does it, unbelievably he does it.  Donner is a great director, handling films after this such as all four Lethal Weapon movies, Conspiracy Theory and Maverick.  He directed most of the second Superman movie, but you can tell someone else took over by the looser handling of the picture.  This movie stands out above all the others though.  The chemistry between Reeve and Margot Kidder, who plays Lois Lane, is incredible.  Both of them have to switch gears in their characters, Reeve obviously between Kent and Superman, and Kidder between the tough reporter and the love sick woman who can't stand to be around Superman without blushing at everything he says.  Both performances are pulled off expertly.  Gene Hackman is brilliant as Lex Luthor, the greatest criminal mind of our time.  He portrays Luther as he should, a man of the mind, not a man of violence.  This is why Luthor is Superman's arch enemy, he is brilliant.  Superman on the other hand, although smart, cannot be stopped by physical means, but cannot stop Luthor if on some levels he chooses to use tactics that are too far reaching, as he does in this movie.  The extra disk is full of good stuff, great behind the scenes documentaries and interviews.  This DVD is highly recommended.
B000002KBU|5.0|On a personal note, I was introduced to this album when I was nine years old, when it first came out.  My sister Joanie listened to it all the time, and she became linked in my mind to the beauty of Joni Mitchell.  After all, my sister had not only the same first name (albeit with different spelling), but she looked like Joni Mitchell at the time:  skinny, long brown hair, dazzling smile.  Sometimes what you love in life becomes greater when its image is reflected onto something else, and even after that, you find love in the reflection, as well as the image.  As a result of this, it's thirty years later, and I've made sure to have a copy of this album wherever I've been in my life.<br />The beauty and richness of this album can't be compared.  &quot;Blue&quot;, which chronicles an actual relationship of Joni Mitchell's, could have been in fact written for any one of us who has fallen helplessly in love, had the daily struggles of a relationship, and ultimately have the relationship fail, leaving broken hearts in its wake. Love, dissapointment, heartbreak, and quiet resolution are all dealt with, and all of them with simple, poignant honesty.  Aside from a few lyrics which are very much of the times of the late 60's and early 70's - in &quot;California&quot; for example, when she mentions kissing a &quot;Sunset Pig&quot; upon her return to L.A., and then later reflecting on &quot;the war, and the bloody changes&quot; - the material is quite timeless.  After all, love and heartbreak don't exactly go out of style.<br />Everyone has their favorites on this album (which is evident in the other reviews that you'll read besides mine) and I know I have favorites as well, but I'm really not able to choose one.  I can tell you that I love &quot;All I Want&quot; right now in my life, because I'm in love and in that headspace.  Yet &quot;River&quot; also appeals to me with its sweetness and despair.  &quot;Cary&quot; has always had a special place for me, because my sister andI were living in the Canary Islands when she first bought this album, and that song has always reminded me of the little hole-in-the-wall cantinas there.  <br />I guess it's obvious from my review that &quot;Blue&quot; is more than a favorite album to me:  it's deeply personal, interwoven in my own life and the lives of those nearest to me.  But I'm not the only one who is affected by it this way, not by far, and I know I won't be the last.  Listen.  Just listen to it.  You'll be so glad that you did.
B00005Q4CS|5.0|This movie is a hypnotic ride through the realm of addiction. It stays with you long after you take it out of your dvd or vcr. The ending scenes are truly tragic and haunting. Ellen Burstyn is simply fantastic and her performance is absolutely flawless. Watch it and then go out and get the soundtrack (also simply amazing!)
B000021YQV|5.0|This album just pushes the hard rock envelope with amazing lyrics, loudness(must have for me), overall madness(most important), and just some CD that i think you should definetly go out to the store and buy. Yo you wont regret it.

0316779237|3.0|I had such high hopes for this book.  I heard about it when the author read an excerpt on a late night talk show.  Two entries really stand out:  the elf story and the Christmas Pageant critique.  If only the others were as good.  <br />The last entry, &quot;Christmas is for giving,&quot; is just NOT FUNNY.  I appreciate satire, but this just goes over the edge.  Sedaris is at his best when he doesn't grasp at straws and instead just points out the foibles of human nature.  He does a much better job making us laugh at situations that really happen.<br />The Christmas letter and &quot;Dinah, the Christmas Whore,&quot; are somewhat redeeming, but the book starts off so well that it's hard to believe it could end so anti-climatically.
B00004TH83|5.0|Lara's debut album &quot;Lara Fabian&quot; is a wonderful CD that you'll want to have in your music collection. Lara sings very pretty!!! I'm a fan of Lara Fabian,,right now.

B00005JKT8|4.0|Although Meg Ryan was enjoyable as the female lead, there were far too many closeups of her face.  Her hair looked a perpetual mess and we could all see the choice of lipliner color.  Meg Ryan is a pretty woman and would benefit from an image change.  Hugh Jackman was wonderful as the male lead and exuded masculine charm and refinement; quite a departure from his role as Wolverine and Eddie in &quot;Someone Like You.&quot;  The movie's dialogue was fresh and witty.  A good supporting cast helped this movie succeed.  The subplot of Kate's ex-boyfriend in a mental hospital was a bit far-fetched.  However, it was saved by his analogy of time-travel to a dog viewing a rainbow.<BR>All in all a likeable movie.  Hugh Jackman is wonderfully handsome and sexy.  PUT HIM IN MORE MOVIES!
B00004SCX6|5.0|I recieved this CD from one my online friends in the mail. I listened to it on the computer &amp; I love it!!! Oops!! is the best CD released by Brit. I also know that some people dislike Britney ,probably cos of the way she dresses or how she sings. But don't judge her by those things. I think Brit dresses cool &amp; no singer should have to sing perfect, I think Brit sings cool, with that cool voice she has!! I used to not like Brit, myself awhile back, but when I recieved this album.. now I like her &amp; her voice. Britney isthe best pop female-singer of our time!!!! Please just buy the Oops! CD.. and don't judge her by the way she dresses or how her voice sounds when she sings, just buy the CD!!! Thankyou. I Hope this review was helpful for those who don't have the CD yet. My favorite tracks are, &quot;Stronge&quot; , &quot;Lucky&quot; , &quot;Can't Make You Love Me&quot;, and &quot;Where Are You Now&quot;.Also I've got the europeanversion of the Oops CD, so it has one extra song called &quot;Girl In The Mirror&quot; That one is my other fav too:) Great Work, Brit:-)*
B0000013G9|5.0|TLC have been no strangers to the limelight since 1992, mainly for shenanigans outside of the recording studio.  Sometimes overlooked however is the major impact this R'N'B Trio have exercised right back from the days of What About Your Friends &amp; Baby,Baby,Baby.  With their glow-colo(u)r outfits &amp; big badges, at first glance they may have seemed like a throwaway teen-pop ensemble.  That is however until the release of the cool titled CrazySexyCool.  Spoken as one word, the girls' insistence on creating a new word for pop-culture's vocabulary forbodes interesting things. Almost 7 years later this album still blows me away - me &amp; 12 million others.  With almost every track co-written by at least one of the group, TLC proved their worth by producing an album of pure streetwise funk&amp;  r'n'b with an accessible pop edge.  Creep, with its ultra funky horn hook &amp; T-Boz's tenor vocals gave an insight into the cutting-edge coolness of the album.  Waterfalls defines TLC's legacy with its socially conscious lyrics about keeping things real.  Red Light Special shows that these gals had grown up &amp; know how to get it on.  NASTY!!! For me however, the album's highlights are some of the non-released trax.  Something Wicked, the album's closer, sounds like a rip-off of Janet Jackson's This Time, but is a fantastic tune, while Let's Do It Again rips along &amp; puts you in good mood.  Add also a faithful rendition of Prince's If I Was Your Girlfriend &amp; a sexy Take Our Time &amp; you have one helluvan album.  Worth its weight in gold &amp; still sounding as fresh all these years later, the girls did themselves proud.  By the way, there are some quite amusing narratives between the songs too - if you haven't heard them alreay these alone will make the album a vital purchase, just for the sheer fun of it -
B000009ED0|2.0|Yes, 1998, the year where rock music went straight to the trailer park for inspiration.  As if it wasn't bad to have Limp Bizkit around, Fred Durst had to do a cameo in the video for Bawitdaba, which was partly responsible for this piece of garbage getting heavy TRL rotation and selling like a trillion copies.  That has to be the stupidest name for a song I've ever heard.<br />The first single &quot;I am the Bullgod&quot; was tolerable, and like a lot of the songs on this awful album it was at least catchy.  But seriously, when would any person with more than a grade school education actually be sitting around thinking, &quot;You know what?  I'd really like to hear some Kid Rock right about now.&quot;  Its the kind of music that's appropriate maybe only for watching WWF Championship Wrestling.  Or maybe its something you'd put on while beating your wife, I don't know.<br />Plus the horrible God Knows Why single is on this album, where Kid Rock uses some cheesy vocoder effect on his vocals.  I guess its supposed to be sad and reflective, but it just makes me nautious, kind of like every other song on this album.
0780626966|3.0|Mt parents will never thanks Robert Englund for the sleepless nights he gave me as a young boy when NOES was released in 1984.  Although i can watch it now, our favourite villain's subsequent movies left a lot to be desired.  The first movie is definitely the classic (in particular the bedroom sequence with Tina & Freddy's extended arms in the alleyway).  Later movies really cash in on Freddy-mania & deviate towards black comedy rather than going out to give audiences a good scare - altho Part 3 (with Langenkamp returning again as Nancy) is a forgivable part of these 5 movies.  The rest is really candyflosss watching & worthy to have as part of the Freddy saga.  Thank heavens parts 6 & 7 were not included here, as otherwise I would have to give only 1 star!  Definitely worth investigation if you love the first movie or indeed wish to make this part of your DVD Collection.
B00005OM4N|5.0|Britney's latest work is awesome!!  To all those britney haters: Listen to the album before you decide anything about her. Don't be jelous of her talent and beauty!  Well I think everyone out ther should have this CD in your collection. The beats make you want to get up and dance!  I can't get enough of it!  Go Brit!
B000002UWP|5.0|This album catapulted Roxette to the top of their league in 1991.  Riding on the success of Look Sharp! &amp; It Must Have Been Love, Roxette became famed mainly for their power rock ballads.  Kicking off the album came the title track with silly lyrics but a killer chorus.  If you listen to the musical content of the song however you appreciate Roxette's attention to the musical content of their songs.  It races between guitar drive pop to acoustic then rises to saloon-ype piano before reverting back to electric guitar.  Fantastic.<br />The album falls into 2 catgories - catchy pop or power ballads.  Formulaic it may be, but certainly works.  pop side you have catchy stuff like I Remember You (with uplifting nana's) &amp; the riotous Soul Deep which just swings along.  There's also a hot-rock song called HotBlooded - a live! favourite still after all these years.  The ballads are something else even if you get the feeling they've been taken from a recipe book.  The singles Fading Like A Flower &amp; Spending My Time are gorgeous, particularly the latter, which reveals Marie's vocal talents.  Excited is real power-vocals, while Watercolours In The Rain is nursery-rhyme like.  It's just Marie &amp; a guitar.  Stunning.<br />Add a gazillion sales, worldwide adoration, &amp; you have a slight glimpse of the legacy of Roxette.  Still releasing albums today, Joyride is by no means their best work (for that see Have A Nice Day - one of the best albums ever), however testament to the brilliance of these Swedes
B00003CY5J|2.0|Despite nice performances by DeNiro, Norton and Brando, this movie never gets going. The plot is a mild variation from the genre. The only thing that keeps this from being a standard B movie is the cast and a few (very few) nice lines of dialog.<br />One of the big disappointments in the movie is that we never get to know the characters. We know absolutely nothing about Norton's character, slightly more about DeNiro's and a little more about Brando's.
B000002UTT|5.0|I was initially dubious about an album which contained lyrics about people 'hitting like a hammer' &amp; moreover, owing allegiance to ABBA as Sweden's best export, I thought Roxette were a 1-hit wonder.  And they say what goes around comes around..... 13 years after purchasing this CD, I still remain an avid fan of Roxette, (whose latest albums are at times better than when they were dominating the world).  This album did 'it' for Per &amp; Marie.  You know the story of how they were discovered internationally............ This CD boasts 4 timeless hits songs which still sound as fresh today as way back then.  The Look, with Marie's powerful NaNaNas, which segues perfectly into Dressed For Success - the opening 3 seconds alone make you hairs stand on end.  What a voice Ms Fredrikkson has.  The power anthem Listen To Your Heart is perhaps one of soft-rocks canonised songs - it is on practically every Rock Ballad cd compilation out there &amp; you can tell why.  Dangerous is the weakest single &amp; perhaps one of the weakest trax on the album.  EMI were spoilt for choice here.  Cry is a dramatically gorgeous ballad which could have been Number 1, while Dance Away &amp; Sleeping Single have 'hot' written over them.  My fave track however is Shadow Of A Doubt.  Understated pop, it reveals the dexterity of Marie's vocals &amp; Gessle's mastery as a song-writer.  With every song written by the man himself, &amp; with 9 million avid purchasers of the album, the group were on a winner &amp; makes the audience hungry for more from these power rockers.  If you don't own this CD, you could do a lot worse with $15.
B000002MP2|5.0|Many hardcore punk fans say that this is not their best album, because it is not their punkiest.  I love punk, but I think there's nothing wrong with a little more pop and a little less punk.  It's still a great CD.  It has a lot of great songs.  It's one of those CDs that you can listen to straight through, without skipping over a bunch of stupid songs.  Some CDs you buy for one  or two songs.  This album is great all the way through.
B00000DFRS|4.0|Whitney Houston has never been an artist that I have considered 'out there' or 'on the tip', so to speak.  So when I snapped up this album in late 1998 without having heard a track from it, I was fairly astounded - &amp; pleasurably so.  Having enlisted some of today's hottest prudcers on the go, including SupaDupa Miss-E Elliott, Lauryn Hill &amp; Rodney Jerkins to name but a few, Whitney ensured that a return after 8 years with her first full-length studio album was going to be worth it.  Okay, the first single did not fare well for the eventual success of the album.  Whitney goes head-to-head in the vocal arena with Ms Carey for a theme tune from The Prince of Egypt.  Entitled, When You Believe, I for one did not believe that 2 of the world's greatest vocalists agreed to sing such garbage. The song only winds up being tuneless as W &amp; M try to out-diva each other with more vocal acrobatics than a circus.  Shame, as the collaboration could have proven to the world much more than it did.  Anyways, that aside, the rest of the album rocks, although in a mid-tempo type of way.  No So Emotional or I Wanna Dance type songs here.  You have creme de la creme r'n'b.  The first 'proper' single, It's Not Right hosts one of the hippest videos in existence &amp; does the song proud - a sort of a Sistas Are Doin' It For Themselves.  Then Whitney thinks she's Lauryn Hill in My Love Is You Love - &amp; it works. The song lilts along, builds up &amp; down as Whitney professes her unconditional love for her man (a modern equivalent of La Ross's Ain't No Mountain High Enough).  There's an outstanding collaboration with unlikeley sistas Faith Evans &amp; Kelly Price on Heartbreak Hotel, which is just lush &amp; wonderful.  A true treat.  I Learned From The Best, the Diane Warren penned track is a guaranteed winner - name me a Diane Warren track that isn't!, although it sounds remarkably like En Vogue's super Too Gone, Too Long (which Diane also wrote).  The rest of the album plodsalong.  If I Told You That (sans George Michael) is better than the single version - v. happy &amp; upbeat. The Missy collaboration, In My Business, sticks a swift middle finga up @ those who thought her marriage to bad boy Bobby Brown was doomed.  I Bow Out is another true winner.  This is a CD which is often played in my home &amp; car, as it is brimming with sheer quality.  The most admirable thing about the album is that despite the host of producers &amp; song-writers who worked on the album, My Love Is You Love remains consistent &amp; satisfying - &amp; has marked a true return to form for those who thought La Houston had been consigned to soundtrack recordings for the rest of her career.  I would have given it 5 Stars if it wasn't for that ghastly Mariah duet.
B00005RFAI|5.0|I already liked very much &quot;Can't Take That Home&quot; but I must say that I love &quot;Missundaztood&quot;.<BR>Pink didn't hesitate to take risks and the result is a mesmerizing, personal and original album, something rather rare in the music industry today, especially with young and ultra talented artists like P!nk.<BR>The sound of &quot;Missundaztood&quot; should please a lot of people: From the wonderful anthemic first single &quot;Get The Party Started&quot;, passionate ballads (&quot;Eventually&quot;, &quot;My Vietnam&quot;, &quot;Gone To California&quot;), to intimate and very personal tracks (&quot;Family Portrait&quot;, &quot;Dear Diary&quot;), P!nk has definitly proved that she's one of the most talented young artist today, who dares to surprise and amaze people in a different and fabulous way.<BR>HIGHLY RECOMMENDED
B00005Q66T|4.0|Madonna's past 11 years since the uber-success of The Immaculate Collection, Vogue &amp; The Blonde Ambition Tour has been one of plenty of highs (which is why this cd has been released) but also plenty of lows.  What was intriguing about The Immaculate Collection was that not only was it a meltdown of Madonna's principal classic hits, they were also remixed - clever marketing to ensure that lesser fans also had to buy the original albums &amp; also a means by which to refresh to age of some of the songs.  GHV2 on the other hand is merely a synopsis of some key trax in Madonna's career from her under-valued Erotica &amp; Bedtime Stories albums to the celebrated Ray of Light years onwards, plus a few soundtrack songs (Beautiful Stranger &amp; Don't Cry For Me Argentina).  Not all the singles off each album are included (therefore some of your faves may only be on the original albums), but what the GHV2 CD does give is a nostalgic hark back upon the second part of La Ciconne-Ritchie's amazing success story. Few artists can legitimately release two very distinct Greatest Hits cds with confidence &amp; for that Madonna is worthy of admiration &amp; awe-inspirED respect (not that she ever gets any).  Some key tracks which are alone worth buying the album for are Take A Bow (a tragically poetic lullaby which was only a No.16 hit in Britain despite being acknowledged as one of Madonna's finest hours), the single edit of Ray of Light (never fails to get me moving), the rebellious Human Nature (naughty words removed) &amp; the country chic of Don't Tell Me (which has one of the the most effective video clips she's ever done).  Okay, so if I have all her albums &amp; singles, why have I bought this?  The answer is, I don't know.  That's the great thing about Madonna, every thing she puts her hand to is so succcessful that you feel compelled to acknowledge every thing she invests her talent into &amp; in ways it is my way of not only adding a few extra pennies to her pocket but for saying 'Thank-You'.  Can you imagine a world or indeed culture without such hits which have shaped our time?  Neither can I.
6305508550|5.0|This movie is about a man named Peter. Peter's day starts out like this: he gets stuck in a traffic jam, where his truck is moving slower than frozen molasses running down the Alpines. Later, his problems involve &quot;The Memo&quot; and some copy machine issues. My favorite scene in this movie is the &quot;Red-Stapler&quot; scene. I would reccomend this to fans of &quot;There's Something About Mary&quot; and &quot;BASEketball&quot;.
B00005OM4N|4.0|Britney's first two albums were difficult affairs.  Some strong songs (...Baby One More Time, Stronger) & the rest seeming fillers (why, oh why did she record Lucky?).  I reluctantly bought this album because I didn't know if I liked the first single enough.  Yes, it's a grower & v. sexy but not a totally blinding track.  I'm glad I overcame my reluctance.  Altho' I'm not a teen pop afficioado by any stretch, this album has blown me away.  The theme of the album is about Britney growing up & while very few albums have worked as themed affairs, save Janet Jackson's Rhythm Nation 1814, Britney works out fine.  Overprotected (a song which states Let Me Be Me, Not What You Want Me To Be) races along in the famed Max Martin type way & outdoes Baby One More Time.  Add to that the extra sultry video.  Dido co-writes a very nice (albeit long-titled) I'm Not A Girl, Not Yet A Woman which swings along nicely.  Boys is extra-sultry.  Add to that a pop-cover version of Joan Jett's anthem I Love Rock'n'Roll (altho the production of the song doesn't exactly go hell to leather with electric guitars) & you have a very satisfying & enjoyable album.  It will by no means collect accolades such as best album in the world, however it shall ensure continued & increased fanbase & greater longevity than most teen queens will have.  A worthy addition to your record collection.
6305627401|5.0|I am a big fan of the South Park TV show, so naturally I would enjoy this. I especially liked the musical scores, such as: &quot;Uncle F---a&quot; and &quot;What Would Brian Boitano Do?&quot;. This film's plot is: Stan, Kyle, Kenny, and Cartman sneak into an R-Rated movie. When they start to swear in class, Mr. Mackey calls their parents. Later, the parents find out it was a Canadian film and declare war on Canada. I would reccomend this movie to any fan of the South Park series or any other of Matt and Trey's movies.
B00005OB0A|4.0|Kylie's last album Light Years is a tough act to follow up.  Perhaps one of the most consistently brilliant dance albums since Janet Jackson's Rhythm Nation 1814, it bolstered Kylie's star higher than the heavens.  The initial signs from Fever have so far been favourable.  Can't Get You Out of My head (written by Cathy Dennis!!!), with its simple techno-beat &amp; la-la-la's is perhaps one of the happiest &amp; most brilliant songs of the last 2 decades.  The sales reflected that (Number 1 in over 20 countries)&amp; fans have readily snapped up this album in the process.  Maybe a bit too soon.  While Light Years is diverse, embracing a smattering of pop styles, Fever sounds like one long beat attached to which are different lyrics &amp; choruses.  Not bad if you want consistency, but not brilliant if you want a challenging listen. NEVERTHELESS, the album does yield some exceptional songs.  Burning Up has No1 written all over it &amp; Come Into My World is enticing &amp; sexual. Danefloor has 'gay' written over it as Kylie (no doubt in hotpants) dances her ass off in order to get over her man.  Great song.  Love At First Sight (not the same as on her first album) is another humdinger of a toon, which gets me smiling.  However, the album has some clangers &amp; I fear these are the ones which are going to be showcased as singles, if recent promotion indicates.  Title track is just....boring &amp; In Your Eyes is bland.  Sorry, I love Kylie to death &amp; perhaps I am jading my appreciation of the album by comparing it too much to Light Years.  However when you have an album of that quality, it's hard not to.  Nevertheless, Fever is a great work &amp; some of the songs are outstanding, which is why I'm giving it 4 Stars.
B00004Y6RO|5.0|Man, I love this album so much! Slipknot shows that the more band members, the better. Let me start off by tellin' you about the band. <BR>   #0, Sid (wears a gasmask) if MUCH better than DJ &quot;Lethal&quot; of Limp D*ksuck, and this is the first DJ I have heard used to his/her full extent. He sounds great and adds a great sound to the band.<BR>   #1, Joey (wears white kabuki mask) is one incredible drummer. He not only plays in a very complex way, Joey uses the double bass drum incredibly fast. One of the best new drummers today.<BR>   #2, Paul (wears pigmask) is a great bassist. His bass is very detuned and sounds great. I love the stuff he does on &quot;Surfacing&quot; and &quot;wait and bleed&quot;.<BR>   #3, Chris (wears pinochio mask) is a custom percussionist and let me tell you, along with Slipknot's heavy riffs, Chris's style of percussion sounds incredible! It adds a real badass sound to Slipknot's music.<BR>   #4, James (wears sort of &quot;human&quot; mask) is the rhythm guitarist. I say it's always a good thing to have more than one guitarist. He's really fast and heavy. James is talented, fast, and does some cool stuff on tracks like &quot;Wait and bleed&quot; and &quot;Eeyore&quot; (Eeyore is a secret track. To find it, go to the last track and fast forward for a long time.)<BR>   #5, Craig (wears a mask with long pins in it) is the sampler. He adds some really weird but cool sound affects to some songs, and he sometimes does most of a song (like the first track and most of the last tracks.)<BR>   #6, Shawn, (clown mask) is the second percussionist. Chris's profile is the same as Shawn's. One thing though, Shawn is one of the founders of Slipknot, and he goes crazy on stage!<BR>   #7, Mick (sort of medieval iron mask) is the lead guitarist. He's probably my favorite new guitarist. Mick is very talented, as you can hear on &quot;Surfacing&quot;,&quot;Eeyore&quot;, and &quot;Eyeless&quot;. Mick is a very fast and heavy guitar player. He uses a badassguitar too!<BR>   #8, Corey (crash dummy with dreadlocks mask) is the lead singer. This guy is one crazy mofo, onstage and off. Corey's can sing (very well I might add) as well as scream. His voice was made for this type of music.<BR>   Now for the music. Slipknot's music is pretty unique, and is very heavy, as well as very fast. By blending fast guitar riffs, detuned notes, fast drumming, weird sound affects, a hint of rap, and DJ scratches creates one incredible wave of sound. Slipknot will be around for a long time, and I will always be a fan of them. I also recommend Slipknot's home video (although it's short), and their new album. Oh, one more thing, buy this digipak because for just a little extra you get good remixes, old songs off of demo tapes, and a live song. Get this!
B00003CXXS|5.0|Jurassic is one of few movie series that I love unconditionally.  I normally don't buy Region 1 DVDs unless I know they are not being released in the UK.  However, for this one I made an exception. It may have not done the business in the cinema the way the first two of the series did, but Johnston's replacement of Spielberg as Director is a seamless one.<br />So you might say that what can a 3rd instalment about pre-historic creatures give us that has not already been done before? This movie gives you an elaborate answer. With the return of Sam Neill as Alan &amp; special guest appearance from Dern, this movie feels like the true sequel to the first instalment.  Taking place on another dino-infested island, Neill guides Macy &amp; Leoni et al through a ravenous island where beast are free to live in their natural habitat - hence creating a few scares on the way.  Most notable is the introduction of the Spinosaurus Egypticus - the biggest &amp; fiercest carnivor of them all - there's a gripping battle with the movie's hitherto principal antihero, T-Rex &amp; an amusing scene with a satellite phone. A true movie gem.  The outcome of the sequence leaves you in no doubt as to who the mother of all dinos are.  Velociraptors are back with a vengeance &amp; with an evolutionary edge.  The film builds on suggestion that the most evil of the Jurassic age was a communal beast that had its own developed communication skills.  We watch in horror as they track down &amp; kill the human visitors.  My fave scene of the movie is the Birdcage sequence which is thrilling &amp; fantastic to watch.<br />You get an overall sense that the movie's creators have sought to give their audiences new chunks to bite into - mainly about evolution &amp; man's battle against temptation.  I was thoroughly satisfied by the movie's direction &amp; edge.  Certainly there were parts missing.  The ending was too rapid &amp; everything works out between Neill &amp; his ingenu assistant - but hey it's the movies &amp; the film does not profess to be Einstein's sibling.<br />Add to a cracking movie a series of in-depth featurettes &amp; behind the scenes footage &amp; you have a whopper of a DVD which succeeds not only in the fun &amp; brilliance of the movie, but the quality of the package as a complete synthesis of the movie from pre-production.  A guilty pleasure which I'm glad I bought
B000003TAW|4.0|I FINALLY got this CD many years after it's release, and I loved it.  This really brought back memories of the new wave-punk of the seventies and eighties, and this CD was executed with all the passion and intensity of the times - with no 90's waffling or overproduced [stuff]... that permeated so many similar sounding bands of the time.<br />Give these 'weezers' a try if you are still a fan of the power-punk-pop thing of the late 70's early 80's (my high school daze).  If you were never a fan of this kind of thing, or willing to give the 'pop-punk' thing a go, this is the one!
B00005R23X|3.0|What could have been the epic, closest to Stoker interpretation of DRACULA turns out to be an experiment in turning Dracula into a romantic hero-villain.  Stoker's Dracula was the opposite, a sinister, evil, truly King of the vampires who even had bad breath.  What we get is Gary Oldman as an odd-looking (at the beginning of the film), tortured, romantic bloodsucker.  I don't mind people making variations on the Dracula theme, but calling your film BRAM STOKER'S DRACULA and then straying from the basic plot of the novel (really about Harker and Mina VS Dracula...not Mina being his reincarnated bride...which is a rip-off of Karloff's Mummy film of 1932) is not how to do it.  The best version I've seen yet is the PBS Louis Jourdan version COUNT DRACULA, though I think either Christopher Lee or Max Von Sydow would have made a more memorable Count in that version.  Anthony Hopkins and Keenu Reeves are miscast and Sadie Frost as Lucy is the best part of the film.   I also didn't like the ending.  Hopefully someone will film DRACULA and really do it justice someday, including parts of the Stoker novel that have never been filmed, like the wolves attacking the mother of the baby Dracula gives to his &quot;brides&quot; to feast on!.  You would need a <BR>6-8 hour mini-series to do the story properly.
B000007S5B|4.0|The Doors first to records were so powerful that their third long player was met by many as a disappointment. Many felt the band had gone soft and had changed from rock to soft pop. Truth be told the Doors third album was an escape from the raging psychadelia found on the first two albums however the band was far from going soft.<br />The opening track HELLO I LOVE YOU was a #1 hit for the group.  It's a good song but seems a little too poppy to be coming from the Doors.  WE COULD BE SO GOOD TOGETHER seems to follow the same form.  For it's a catchy tune but it just isn't the Doors.  This record also has it's share of pop drenched love ballads like SUMMER'S ALMOST GONE, WINTERTIME LOVE, LOVE STREET and YES, THE RIVER KNOWS.  Although these efforts are odd coming from the Doors they are decent.  LOVE STREET is catchy and YES, THE RIVER KNOWS has a nice jazz feel to it.  SUMMER'S ALMOST GONE and WINTERTIME LOVE are both fairly weak but are not completely unlistenable.  However don't let these pop tunes fool you their are plenty of dark psychadelic tunes that prove the band did not go completely bubblegum here.  NOT TO TOUCH THE EARTH is brilliant poetry.  UNKNOWN SOLDIER is a haunting anti-war tune.  SPANISH CARAVAN has some wonderful guitar work on it and FIVE TO ONE is just good old hard rock.  The only tune here that is a throw away is MY WILD LOVE which is some bizarre chant.  <br />As a previous reviewer metioned the problem with Waiting For The Sun was the fact that it lacked a long track. Originally Morrison's now famous CELEBRATION OF THE LIZARD was to be on the record but complications arose between the band so the recording was shelved and eventually lost. Only the poem managed to appear in the liner notes. None the less the album made it to #1 on the charts and became the only Doors album to make the top spot.<br />Overall Waiting For The Sun is definetly one of the Doors weaker works but it's still essential.  The dark psychadelic tunes are awesome and most of the brighter tunes are pretty good too.  This album is not band at all but compared to the band's debut or later efforts it's just slightly weak.  However don't be turned off by that.  This is still a nice little album that has aged well.  Highly recommended!
B00005NWM3|4.0|Okay, let me tell you something.  As a Natalie Merchant fanatic, I would never think I would like Nickelback...WRONG...they totally kick butt.  So many different types of styles in their music, awesome lyrics and passion in their music goes to show how much Nickelback emerges not only as a band of democracy, but a band who care about their music....4 stars.

NOT TO TOUCH THE EARTH, LOVE STREET, THE UNKNOWN SOLDIER, SPANISH CARAVAN, and  FIVE TO ONE save the album from being bubblegum but some people will like the soft stuff depending on your taste.  I for one don't mind YES THE RIVER KNOWS or WE COULD BE SO GOOD TOGETHER at all they are quite good but just don't seem to be the Doors as I mentioned earlier.  Bottom line: good album but not exactly essential unless you are a hardcore Doors fan.  I would have given it 3 1/2 stars but I had to round up.  Mildly recommended.
B00005JKMO|5.0|Will Smith delivers the best performance of his career. This is without a doubt a true Knock-Out. Many people say that the film could have been better. This may be true, but only for the simple reason that the writers left out other key moments in Ali's life. Moments such as the the thriller in manila and other key fights. This would have made the movie longer, personaly I wouldnt have mind it at all if it were longer.I wish that it was... This movie was every bit of three hours long, and you wouldn't notice because you would love every minute of it!  \\"A MUST SEE MOVIE\\"
6301562178|5.0|As any cinephile knows, the disaster film genre was hugely popular commercially during the 1970s.  For whatever reason, people paid good money to see a cast of all-stars fight and claw their way out of a cataclysm, be it man-made or natural.  If there is one film from this now-reviled genre that could be called a masterpiece, it would almost certainly have to be THE TOWERING INFERNO, a huge disaster epic from the genre's equivalent of Hitchcock, producer Irwin Allen.<br />This very long (at 165 minutes) but often terrifying suspense thriller is based on two novels--\\"The Tower\\" by Richard Martin Stern; and \\"The Glass Inferno\\" by Thomas N. Scortia and Frank M. Robinson.  It involves a 138-story building in San Francisco called the Glass Tower.  With that many floors, it ranks as the tallest skyscraper on the planet.  And on this night, it is about to be dedicated as another monument to American ingenuity.<br />But there is a problem.  Apparently, the cheapskate son-in-law (Richard Chamberlain) of the building's owner (William Holden) has put in electrical wiring that, while it might be up to all city codes, is insufficient for this particular building.  And on the 81st floor, in a storage room, one power box has blown, starting a fire to some janitorial products.  Even as the big dedication party goes on in the Promenade Room at the top, the fire has totally engulfed the storage room.  Once the door to that room is accidentally opened, all hell breaks loose.<br />The entire San Francisco Fire Department, led by Steve McQueen, arrives on scene to try and contain the fire, but all their best efforts fail; and soon, this greater-alarm blaze becomes a frightening high-rise holocaust, with much of the all-star cast trapped at the top with no way down.  They must then resort to some very drastict measures in order to quench the fire out.<br />Though it has many sub-plots and the requisite love triangles of any other disaster film, THE TOWERING INFERNO also features surprisingly low-key performances from the principal players, keeping the typical soap operatics of the genre down to an extent.  The cast includes, among others, Faye Dunaway, Susan Blakely, Robert Vaughn, Robert Wagner, Jennifer Jones, O.J. Simpson (he rescues a cat, and surprisingly doesn't kill anyone), and Fred Astaire.  John Guillermin, whose previous credits included SKYJACKED and THE BRIDGE AT REMAGEN, does a fine job at directing; and the special effects work of L.B. Abbott, A.D. Flowers, and Frank Van De Veer still stand as being some of the most harrowing of their type.<br />Winner of three Oscars (Song, Editing, Cinematography), and featuring a fairly business-like screenplay from Stirling Silliphant (who won a 1967 Screenplay Oscar for IN THE HEAT OF THE NIGHT), THE TOWERING INFERNO almost certainly ranks as the best film of its often unfairly dismissed type, as well as one of the most frighteningly realistic films ever made.

B000002UCN|5.0|Although truly unfortunate to have this `quiet Beatle` exit before us, one fact will always remain among all FabFour devotees: George Harrison gave to the world what seldom is witnessed in this day and age. Not only did he reveal of himself what other Beatles kept more personal, but he did so out of honest desire to share with and among us all his talented inspiration. Over half this disc's tracks give example to how he contributed to The Beatles like none other members had the charisma to yield. Later solo project material revealed rock music in a manner basically unheard of before his coming. His songs sent messages of hope and faithful understanding. Although short, this CD gives ample expression to what this Ex-Beatle came to achieve and the gifted impact his intentions were to have bestowed upon us. Thank-you George and may your Guitar Gently Smile in Heaven...
B0000029GA|1.0|I'm always hearing how wonderful this album is, but i have no idea why.<BR>I am a hiphop fan, i know what im talking about, but this album is not anything special at all.<BR>The beats are terrible, old-school, with no depth.<BR>Secondly, the lyrics, well, they may be fantastic, but his delivery is poor. <BR>I'm probably going to get lynched for this, but this is just not that good an album, if you want the definitive nas, get stillmatic. <BR>If you really want truly fantastic lyrics, not helium throated vocals, with unlistenable beats, check out Roots Manuva, <BR>The Big L, AND KRS-1.
B000002ARV|5.0|A great album by an extremely well rounded player. Johnny has many influences and you can hear it on this CD. Because of that his style is somewhat hard to pin down...but on this album he comes out of the gate smoking! To say this album  is a little more on the rock side of the blues-rock equation is an understatement. Later he would go on to produce albums that were more straight-ahead Blues. Short and sweet...this would have to make the top 20 of best rock&roll albums of all time. If you're a guitar player--or just someone who loves guitar--then this is a MUST HAVE!!
B00005QZWI|5.0|After seeing the LOTR movie, I immediately asked for the soundtrack for Christmas because the music was so beautiful! I got it for Christmas, and after listening to it a number of times it still hasn't gotten old. All of the tracks fit in so well with the movie, especially #1, Concerning Hobbits, #5, The Black Rider, # 8, Flight to the Ford, #9, Many Meetings, # 13, The Bridge of Khazad-Dum, and # 17, The Breaking of the Fellowship. Enya was such a great contribution, and I really liked the vocals on #17. The music for all of the battle sequences made me jump, and #17, The Breaking of the Fellowship made me cry! In my opinion, if you appreciate good music, this is a great thing to purchace.
B00005QZ7U|2.0|After trying to watch this film sober (and I couldn't),  I have concluded that if it is to make any sense and/or if you really want to enjoy it, you need to get ... drunk.  This film is midnight movie material along the lines of Rocky Horror . . . in other words, get into costume, drink a bottle of tequilla, and enjoy the nonsense.
0385505833|3.0|This is not great literature but a simple pleasant read. A time to relax with an enjoyable tale which is a huge departure from other Grisham works of which I have read all.
0312954468|5.0|As is typical of Wilbur Smith, you often times wonder if what you are reading is fact or fiction.<br />Smith weaves a tale of ancient Egypt as seen through the eyes of Taita, a eunuch, entrusted with the upbringing of his mistress Lostris.  The story revolves around the lives of Lostris, daughter of the grand vizier of the Upper kingdom of Egypt, Tanus, disgraced son of an Egyptian noble and Taita.  Taita, although considered less of a &quot;man&quot; for obvious reasons, is endowed with unsurpassed skills in mathematics, architecture, astology, medicine, military tactics and countless other sciences.  He is, in effect a jack of all trades and a master of them all.<br />Through the narration of Taita, we follow the lives of the three main characters through an aproximately 30 year period of time.  In this time Lostris marries the pharoah and ultimately becomes the queen of Egypt.  Tanus becomes the commander of all the armies.  They are lifetime lovers and the parents of 3 children who are believed to be the progeny of the pharoah (don't ask!).  Taita serves them both throughout the years but is thought of more in a familial way than as a slave.<br />Smith takes us through both the rise and fall and subsequent rise again of the Egyptian empire in splendidly descriptive fashion.  This historical adventure makes you yearn for a sequel much like Birds of Prey and Monsoon.
B000009QPE|5.0|No exaggeration.  This CD is too good. It has everything a great metal CD should have: speed, aggression, blistering solos, lyrics to scare your parents, and some great screaming thanks to then youthful Tom Araya. This album is a hallmark in metal, and few other CDs match it's power. From the opening riff of \\"Angel of Death\\" to the crazy guitar noises at the end of \\"Raining Blood,\\" this album does not let up. Partcularly great on this album is drummer Dave Lombardo, a deity to all metal drummers, including myelf.  His double-bass work will make your jaw drop.  And Hanneman & King don't slouch either.  The rapid fire \\"Angel of Death\\" solos and the ridiculously fast guitar work in \\"Raining Blood\\" should assure that those two are two of the greatest metal guitarists ever. Stand-out tracks include \\"Angel of Death,\\" \\"Altar of Sacrifice,\\" \\"Postmortem,\\" and \\"Raining Blood.\\" Ah, who am I kidding, they all are nearly flawless. If you like metal and don't have this CD, something is wrong. Buy it now. Don't ask questions, just do it.

B00005JCA9|4.0|This DVD collection includes two disks- the first has the movie in widescreen, the second in full screen.  Each disk has some of the same extras, such as musical highlights and a &quot;making of...&quot; sort of documentary.  <br />Some of the more interesting points are the &quot;Seasonal Walk Along Portobello Road.&quot;  This featurette shows how they marked the passage of a year within the move with William Thakkard's (Hugh Grant)walk along the market-filled road.  <br />A quite cute bit is the &quot;Hugh Grant's Film Tips.&quot;  This is just a light look at his recommendations such as not allowing your parents to your film set. <br />All this being said, this is a good movie.  I didn't like it much the first time I saw it- Anna Scott (Julia Roberts) just came across as very selfish and uncaring, which she is.  However, upon further viewings, I have come to empathize with her more, and I like the character more.  The supporting cast is also great.  You come away really rooting for and liking William.
0385505833|4.0|Skipping Christmas was a good book, and it kept me reading. I don't think this is his best work, though. I think John Grisham is at his best when he's writing legal thrillers, and Skipping Christmas most definatly isn't a legal thriller. Buy it and read it, but don't expect it to be your favorite John Grisham book.
1878424319|5.0|I almost did not buy this book based on two reviews I read (a reader from Minneapolis and a reader from Philadelphia) I got the book anyway due to recommendations from friends. I find it very stimulating and transformative. I read the two negative reviews again and realized that these two reviewers had not even read fully read the book, so it makes sense to me how they had a negative reaction to the book. The ideas espoused here reflect truths set forth in different religions and philosophies, but they are presented in a way that is concise and crystal clear. The philosophy here is actually the same lore that is found in Carlos Castaneda's work. The book is a good companion book for the readings of Carlos Castaneda because it crystallizes the teachings of don Juan. It is not overly long, either, so it is easy to read. I highly recommend this book.
B000056QE5|5.0|I've loved this movie for as long as I remember and was thrilled to find the soundtrack.  It sounds wonderful - Disney's pride and joy.  A MUST HAVE for any Julie Andrews or Disney fan's collection.
0812550757|5.0|This is an incredible book, and well worth your while. Speaker for the Dead picks up nearly 3000 years after the first novel in Orson Scott Card's series, Ender's Game. Ender Wiggin, also called The Xenocide and Speaker for the Dead, is summoned to the planet of Lucitania to Speak the death of several scientists. Through his quest to &quot;Speak&quot; the dead and discover their truths, he becomes tangled in several mysterious occurrences on the planet, concerning relations with other inhabitants. The questionable relations are with the Piggies, Lucitanian aboriginies that seem as alien as the Buggers of 3000 years ago. However, in an effort to make up for the Xenocide of the past, and in order to keep the Piggies from becoming too inteligent, humans have established very limited relations with them. Ender, in his quest to speak the dead, understand the Piggies, and deliver the Hive Queen to a new destination, takes us on an incredibly thought-provoking and gripping adventure.<br />While the plot can be understood wtihout previous knowledge of Ender's Game, the underlying comments and questions about human nature are better appreciated if the reader has experienced Ender's Game first. Speaker for the Dead moves at a slower pace than Ender's Game (though much more quickly than the next books in the series, Xenocide and Children of the Mind), and spends more time developing characters and situations rather than advancing the plot. Like Ender's Game, this book appeals equally to Sci/Fi buffs and haters because of its omnipresent themes. This book affected me incredibly- Enjoy!
B000001EIA|2.0|At first glance, the idea of an acoustic KISS set seems odd, to say the least.  However, most of the selections here are played rather well.  Bruck Kulick and Eric Singer complement the tandem of Paul Stanley and Gene Simmons very nicely.  Unfortunately, the whole thing begins to unravel when Ace Frehley and Peter Criss stagger onstage.  They can neither play nor sing competently, a fact which becomes painfully evident as soon as they join in.  Frehley, in particular, looks and sounds like hell, and his miserable musicianship is nearly matched by Criss, whose lousy drumming is surpassed only by his horrid vocals.  Sadly, Paul and Gene decided to sell out completely following this session, dumping Bruce and Eric in favor of the musically inferior (but more marketable) &quot;original&quot; members.  I would give the good parts of this set three stars, but I have to deduct one star for the nearly unbearable presence of Messrs. Frehley and Criss.  Thanks to Bruce and Eric for giving us some fine music, and jeers to Paul and Gene for sacrificing good music (and musicians) for the sake of crass commercialism.
B00005K3LU|4.0|First of all, there's a great movie in widescreen on disc one. Obviously, that's two big assets. Within the film, we get a neat premise in foreign terrorists holding hostages in a skyscraper while a &quot;fly in the ointment&quot; from several floors up tries to thwart the terrorists' plans.  That &quot;fly&quot; is Det. John McClane played with gusto by Bruce Willis. Following the advice of another flyer on the plane that Willis gets off of as the film begins, Willis is in bare feet when he first realizes the building is under siege.  One can't help but say &quot;ouch!&quot; at several points in the film as McClane has to run down stairs, crawl through heating ducts, and over and through broken glass with no socks or shoes.<br />Engaging in cat-and-mouse with McClane is the German leader of the terrorists, Hans Gruber in an excellent first role for Alan Rickman. Gruber is intelligent, cold, methodical and determined to get what he came for.  He relies on many underlings to do most of the work it takes to complete the job.  Most of those, he considers intellectually inferior to himself and they are, to him, simply the means to an end.<br />The film itself never lets up in terms of action and suspense and one feels as though he/she has been put through the ringer when it is over. A couple of minor criticisms though: the dumbbell, inept deputy police chief played by Paul Gleason and the two FBI agents who are prepared to take out the terrorists their own way, are two elements that could have been left out without the movie suffering. To the contrary, it may have been even better.<br />Concerning the DVD itself, there is a lot of good stuff here, including director and cast and crew commentaries, and a few deleted lines and scenes along with numerous trailers and TV spots, but in the end the DVD suffers from lack of a good making-of documentary. One of the things that I've come to expect with most DVD's that I consider worthy to add to my collection is a good making-ofdoc. such as those that can be found on Taxi Driver, The Terminator, etc. Not having one on a DVD of this magnitude is a major minus.  In its place is a seven or eight minute &quot;featurette&quot; that is strictly low grade and should have been trashed and replaced with something better.
B00003CXXJ|5.0|Adults will enjoy this movie with it's vast array of stars. With humorous performances by Mike Myers as the voice of Shrek, Eddie Murphy as The Donkey, Cameron Diaz as Princess Fiona, John Lithgow as Lord Farquad and the supporting cast of &quot;Fairy Tale Things&quot; this movie was truly a funny movie.  It begins with the introduction of Shrek, an enormous green ogre who lives alone in a swamp.  Then through a twist of fate, Eddie Murphy as the hilarious talking donkey enters Shrek's life as his un-invited companion.  Shrek then finds his swamp bombarded with &quot;Fairy Tale Things&quot;, including a decapitated Gingerbread Man as well as the Three Blind Mice and Three Little Pigs and hundreds of other creatures who were forced onto Shrek's property by the evil Lord Farquad.  Shrek then begins a journey to see Lord Farquad to remove the creatures from his property, who sends him on a journey to rescue the beautiful Princess Fiona from the fiery dragon to be his bride so that he may become King.  The action is non-stop as are the laughs in this movie.  The ending has the usual twist with hilarious outakes and a kareoke scene by all the characters at the end. Overall, this film is a must-see for children and adults alike.
0671027344|5.0|Hello. This book is one of the greatest books I have ever read. I read it in two days because I could not put it down, and wish there were more books out there as great as this one. Hopefully one day Stephen Chbosky will write more about Carlie, because I am still very interested in more about him at the end of the novel.
B000003C2U|5.0|This is the album that introduced me to death metal, and is still one of the best, if not the best death metal album ever. In all of his later work, but most successfully in Human, Chuck managed to combine brutality, impressive musicianship, and a keen, though twisted sense of melody.  All the songs on this album, while viciously heavy, are memorable, and dare say it, even hummable at times.  His unique songwriting skills and disgracefully underrated guitar playing were equally matched by the other players in this incarnation of the band: Paul Masvidal and Sean Reinert of Cynic, and Steve DiGiorgio, easily one of the best bassists in metal.<br />Chuck never really got his due in the annals of heavy metal while alive; let's hope he's now recognized as the musical innovator he always was.
B00005IBGQ|5.0|I bought this album after seeing Wainwright in concert in San Diego.  I was there to see Tori Amos, but in the weeks after the concert I kept finding the melodies from Poses in my head.  While I agree with some reviewers that Wainwright's playing leans toward the simplistic, that doesn't mean it's not beautiful.  This is a good album for those who are looking for QUALITY.  Keep in mind many of the great songwriters in the last century have had weak points or have used a simplistic style (Joni Mitchell and Bob Dylan spring to mind first).  Besides all that, Wainwright is young!  If he was at his peak now, where would he have to go?  Listen to the samples.  If you like them, buy it...you won't regret it.
B00005QG9J|3.0|Incubus is one of my favorite bands and I was pretty dissapointed with this CD.  The majority of the 13 songs on this CD were main stream or soft.  There were a couple good old Incubus songs like #1,2,3,11 and 12.  The rest are pretty boring.  Overall, it wasn't too bad, but too mainstream and different from the other Incubus CDs.
B00003CY5I|4.0|If you're a Robert DeNiro fan, you'll enjoy this film.  The co-stars are Marlon Brando, Edward Norton and Angela Bassett.  The film starts out showing Deniro, who plays the thief Nick, a 25-year vet, narrowly escaping a heist.  He goes back to Montreal where he lives and owns a jazz club.  With appearances by Angela Bassett, who plays Nick's girlfriend, we discover she agrees to get more serious provided he quit his robbery \\"business\\" on the side. Marlon Brando then offers Nick the chance for a big payoff, one that will set him straight and allow him to pay off the mortgage on the jazz club and quit.  It would be his last gig.  It's tempting, but risky. The one catch is that the heist is right in Montreal, which goes against Nick's Number 1 rule, never pull a heist where you live or work. To top it all off, Edward Norton is introduced as the character Jack Teller.  Jack's front is the mentally [handicapped] character \\"Brian\\" who works the night shift at the very location where the heist is to go down.  Nick is resistant and untrusting of Jack/Brian, who provides blueprints and the plan for the heist, but needs Nick's expertise to pull it off.  After repeated warnings, Nick agrees to go ahead with the plan using Jack/Brian.  The rest of the film details the planning and execution of the heist, with a surprising twist at the end.   The film's action was continuous.  Overall, a good suspense film.
B00005JKMO|1.0|Actually, I'd give it 1.5 stars.  I have been an Ali fan my entire life.  I can remember sitting at the television, mesmerized by Ali's charisma, and superb boxing as a child with my father.  I have read all I can about Ali, and seen every video available.  This movie did not do his life justice.  Ali was full of energy and charisma.  This movie was not.  It was long and drawn out, full of &quot;artsy&quot; camera shots and cinematography with little of the energy that Ali radiated through out his career.  In a movie of this length, they could have covered more of his life, instead they let the &quot;creative talents&quot; of the director and producers take center stage, while Ali himself would have never let anyone take center stage over himself.  If you're a diehard Ali fan, (whatever you do, don't take your wife, if you go to the theatre, she'll hate it), you'll want to get the video/ dvd, so you can pause it and fast forward.
0064407667|5.0|When I first took a look at this book, I thought I would never like it: it seemed grim and depressing. But then I read it all the way through! It was excellent.<BR>   Here is a bit of the plot: The Baudelaire children - Violet, age 14 (an inventor); Klaus, age 12 (a reader) and baby Sunny (a biter) - learn that their wealthy parents have died in a huge fire that destroyed their mansion. They are then sent to live with their creepy distant relative, Count Olaf, who runs a ghastly theater troupe. Olaf makes them chop wood for no apparent reason, and prepare pasta puttanesca for his fellow actors (who all become drunk). The Baudelaires sleep in a tiny, filthy room with one bed, and with a cardboard box for a wardrobe.<BR>   Olaf reaches the depths of his vileness when he concocts a plot to seize the children's fortune: he attempts to marry Violet, in quite a sneaky way. But Klaus (after reading up on nuptial law) alerts Violet, who gets out of the marriage in her own clever manner. Count Olaf escapes...but promises to be back (which he is, in the next book).<BR>   Yes, this plot sounds highly disturbing. Then again, I am not Lemony Snicket, and I can't adequately describe the book's writing. Snicket goes out of his way to define words like &quot;garlic&quot; and &quot;anchovies&quot;, but in a very entertaining way. He also interprets Sunny's infantile outbursts (&quot;Gack!&quot; means &quot;Look at that shadowy creature emerging from the fog!&quot; or something along those lines), and makes references to his lost love, Beatrice, in random places in the book. The language is old-fashioned, one might say, but in a good way!<BR>   Best of all, though, is the resourcefulness of the three children: they are intelligent, well-read, and generally amazing. Count Olaf, too, is so delightfully evil that the reader feels no guilt about despising him.<BR>   However, I wouldn't recommend &quot;The Bad Beginning&quot; to anyone under ten or so - although, of course, each person isdifferent. I an fourteen, but I only really liked this series when I was thirteen. (Then again, I think the Harry Potter books are terribly scary - although I love them - so there you are.) There are a few literary references (such as Mr. Poe's son Edgar) that younger kids might not understand, and of course, the plot is pretty scary. But I believe that anyone age eleven or above could enjoy &quot;The Bad Beginning,&quot; even adults. (I've met adults who were in love with it.)<BR>   But of course, you should not trust me. I suggest you read it for yourself: I doubt that you will be disappointed.
B00003XACV|5.0|This disc contains some of the most beautiful melodies I've ever heard. I don't really know what else to say except BUY IT.  The tracks are short and it was written to go along with the movie, but I don't feel that American Beauty the film had a negative impact on this music by any means.  They are symbiotic...each would lose some power without the other.  If you like this disc, I strongly recommend the soundtrack for Bodies, Rest and Motion.  It has the same type of depth and beauty as this music.
B00005JKES|5.0|Finally...I've been waiting for this for years!!!  While having the VHS box-set did include the second season (let's hope that it's forthcoming),the audio/video quality was absolutely terrible.  Now, every frame, every spoken word, gives the viewer the thrill of watching Twin Peaks again for the first time.  I still can't get over how much more is visible in each of these intriguing episodes.  And let's not forget the packaging which is beautiful.  The clear plastic (get it?) slip cover with it's picture of Laura Palmer and the tri-fold DVD holder all add to the total package...worth it's weight in gold...or should that be coffee?
B00003CXTG|4.0|The basic theme of the story centers around the love triangle involving the characters played by Ben Affleck, Kate Beckinsale and Josh Hartnett.  The first hour of the film drags on at times in the building of this triangle.  The film then ventures into the events leading to the bombing itself as well as the events after the bombing.  The special effects were believable and well timed.  The end of the DVD and VHS version offer a documentary through the History Channel with interesting explainations and facts surrounding the bombing.  The cast of characters also include supporting roles by known actors such as Cuba Gooding Jr., John Voight, Alec Baldwin, Dan Akroyd, Andrew Bryniarski, and Guy Torry to name a few.  With the movie containing a mix of history centered around a romantic theme, overall, it was an enjoyable film.
0805062971|4.0|This book is gloomily and deeply fascinating.  From the first page to the last your completely interested in where this book takes you.  Having finished this book about three days ago from now I cant get over how many well put together aspects of interest there are to this book.  Although there are a few lines that could have been worded better  Fight Club is still a savagely twisted puzzel that you will be happy to peice together.
0380973650|2.0|American Gods has the hints of a great novel hidden under too many pages and too many words. It has an original story at its center, but so many subplots and unecessary character arcs that it becomes easy to lose interest in the narrative. This is a book which, unfortunately, should have been a hundred pages trimmer.<br />Gaiman brings us another one of his wonderfully imaginative plots; here, we have a tribe of old gods, all of them forgotten by American citizens, many of them dying or fading away. And then you have the new gods, the Wall-Street gods, the dot-com gods, the city gods, the ones that are powerful and presently active. But these gods also fear; today's people forget quickly and changes their taste often. A god can disappear in not time. And thus, a war is forming between the old gods and the new gods. And at the center of this war is Shadow, an ex-con human who is brought into all this madness against his own will and who will become a key character in the threatening war.<br />The plot per se is interesting. But Gaiman often forgets what the main tale is. Instead, he often gets lost in subplots and unnecessary story arcs that leads us nowhere. Often, you have sections of great suspense and thrills followed by twenty or thirty pages of nothing. Nothing at all. Reading this book can often get quite tiresome.<br />And I was disppointed that this book doesn't hold as much cynicism, wit and irony as other, better Gaiman books do. I am a huge fan of Neverwhere and Stardust; both books were highly imaginative and both books had this strange sense of dark humour that just amazed me. Those books were purely magical. There isn't much of that to be found in American Gods. The story is a bit dry and empty at its center.<br />Gaiman tried to write an American novel, when what he should have done is keep on doing with what he does best; British fantasy (if such a genre does exist). This is an epic book which has too many words and too many pages. And it's too bad, because within those 470 pages, you have a very good story which is dying to come out. It's just never really given the chance to do so properly.d, because within those 470 pages, you have a very good story which is dying to come out.

B00000FC5H|3.0|How can you purport a CD to be a collection of The Greatest Hits of Earth Wind &amp; Fire and leave off &quot;Love's Holiday?&quot; Perhaps this would have been understandable in the days of vinyl, when 18 songs would have required a triple LP, but in the digital age, there is no excuse.  'Nuff said.
B00005RIKD|3.0|Yes yes, kudos to Sting for trying something new--I mean, that's why we love him, right? But I just don't think this new sound meshes well with the old favorites. I know &quot;Roxanne&quot; too well to hear it completely redefined, and worse yet--you can't sing along to them. Maybe it's just my style preference, but don't expect to get misty-eyed hearing &quot;Every Breath You Take&quot; mixed up and sped up. I wouldn't reccomend buying this album unless you like the idea of combining Sting Classics with Jazz.
B000002KON|5.0|without a doubt one of the most underrated albums of all time. i'm positive that Ray Davies wore himself out with this album. these songs are pure brilliance. you'll hear 3 or 4 melodic ideas in almost every song and each one of them are golden sweet.<br />you can hear that they're streching themselves a bit in terms of the instrumentals, but that doesn't detract from the music at all. this is w/o a doubt the height of the Kinks powers.
B00003CXSP|5.0|Hannibal isn't your typical sequel.  Not often does a movie studio not demand a sequel to a highly successful movie right away.  And, that paid dividends here.  Hannibal was a wonderfully constructed movie that had every element the first one did, plus some.  It showed time was put into it and was thought out.  <br />Personally, I thought Hannibal was better than the original.  I did think Jodie Foster was better than Julianne Moore was, but I could look past that.  <br />Brains behind a sequel.  That's something you don't see very often.  Ridley Scott did a great job directing, and Anthony Hopkins was as good, if not better.  The movie seemed to gel perfectly together.  It moved at an eloquent pace and left you in awe at times.  The Cinematography was fantastic.<br />Hannibal is a great film that I am happy I finally watched.  When you go to Blockbuster and use a free rental, and not watch the movie and end up with a late fee, it kind of leaves a sour taste in your mouth.  But, never the less, Hannibal is a must see movie and shouldn't be seen after a heavy meal.  5 Stars
B00005BJ2O|5.0|This CD truly captures the essance of truth, beauty, freedom, and love. As a 14 year-old, I can only hope that my life will be graced by a love like the soundtrack portrays. Since hearing the songs, I cannot rid my mind of their beauty, and they truly, truly are beautiful songs....
B000001DZM|5.0|One of the greatest compilations of all time. One of the greatest movies of all time. I can only say superlatives when I think of this soundtrack. I've got it since 3 years but it is still one of my favorite albums in my collection of more than a 1000 CD-s. Once I put it in the player I can't help playing it less than 4-5 times.<br />Though the soundtrack can be loved without watching the movie first, I highly recommend everyone to watch the movie and then buy the soundtrack. I know there was an American re-make of the original movie, but originals usually play better and it is true in this case, too. Sometimes the movie may be a bit harsh but that's just life. It isn't a fairy tale (neither life nor Priscilla). After watching the movie the soundtrack makes you remember of the hilaroius and not so hilarious moments of the movie and your own life.<br />The title of my review isn't a &quot;fortunate coincidence&quot;, it is true. The first song describes perfectly my view of life, though I'm not a woman (Charlene, the singer is). All the other songs are great, too, especially &quot;I Love The Nightlife&quot;, &quot;I Don't Care If The Sun Don't Shine&quot;, &quot;Mamma Mia&quot;, &quot;Save The Best For Last&quot;, etc... These are all well-known songs but they are perfectly put together on this album. There isn't a filler which is rare in the case of a soundtrack album. So what I suggest is that you watch the movie, buy the soundtrack and not trust the bad reviews... the writers couldn't get the message of Priscilla. Which is: whatever happens, just live your life. I think that's a good message.
B00003CY3W|5.0|I went to this movie with low expectations. My mother saw it and drove me an hour away to the nearest art theater, insisting that i would love this movie. She said the main character was just like me. I had no idea what i was in for. Enid is a classic adolescent character, reminiscent of Mick in the heart is a lonely hunter. she is discontented with her world and more insightful than anyone around her. Many teenage girls might find her a cynic or depressing, but for a few of us (those who enjoy retro kitsch and easily become infatuated with middle aged misfits) this movie is a perfect caracature of our world.
6301236947|5.0|i saw this movie when it was out in the theaters,and i've watched the video time and again...a u2 video is the next best thing to seeing the band live,and they're one of the best live bands i've ever seen.my sister and i have bonded over this movie time and again...it's one of our rituals.i haven't gotten bored with it yet,and i don't think i will...
B00003CXXS|5.0|JPIII is easily the best movie of the year. It was chilling, funny, the dinosaurs were fantastically rendered, ETC. ETC. ETC.! I saw it several times in the theater. If you like dinosaurs, buy this. If you like exciting movies, buy this. If you don't buy it, you are strange and ugly, and nobody likes you so you should probably buy it to fit in and make friends.

6304030983|3.0|except for the special affects, the movie was good. maybe it's cause i had justed watched how they made jurassic park, and all that stuff about gpi. but, these affects look really bad. i mean the monkeys in the kitchen don't even look half real. and if you watch closely, the police officer and the aunt are blasted away (you know, during the monsoon!) before the doors and the water come out. i mean, the movie is good, so is the story, and the cast is AWESOME!!!!!!!!!!! but the affects are terrible! no gpi at all!!!!!!!!!
6305669651|4.0|well, this movie is excellent. there is a lot of nudity, sex, and violence but there is passion and romance and love and fear. i love historical movies of all kinds (even if they aren't based on actual events.) i had never even heard of this movie till i went to visit my sister and watched it at her house. i love it. it's a tale of murder and betrayal and striking fear into the hearts of roman citizens. the story of a man, caius caligula, who takes the throne from the previous emperor. i believe it said that caligula was adopted as heir becuz the emporer didn't have any sons. the unrated version on dvd has behind the scenes documentary that tells of how they made the movie and how it was banned in all these different countries and has talks with the cast and crew. it's a great work of art. the sexual content is incredibly high but could be of great use if yr married. all in all this is an excellent movie that i encourage anyone over the age of 18 to see. i believe that it's much too adult for children. you won't be disappointed in this movie. (this review refers to the unrated version in dvd format)<br />if you want to leave out most (if not all) of the sexual content you can buy the rated r version on dvd or video

B00005QZ7U|5.0|Luhrman, who in the past gave us the Leonardo Dicaprio/Claire Daines' Romeo and Juliet, who is known for his superb cinematography and use of MTV pop culture symbolism, has once again outdone himself in this remarkable love story. Set in turn-of-the century Paris, a bohemian poet Christian (Mcgregor) has joined the circle of writers, dancers and musicians who work for the comedic and dimunitive Toulousse Latrec(played by Leguizamo). During a making of a musical which they indeed to perform before the Duke who has threatened to close down the Moulin Rouge, Christian falls in love with the doomed courtesan Satine (Nicole Kidman) who is at her best in the role. The love story is mixed with excellent dance numbers, such as the can-can in the Moulin Rouge sequence, and songs such with Kidman's &quot;Diamonds Are A Girl's Best Friend&quot;, the Elton John love song &quot;How wonderful life is now you're in the world&quot;, &quot;Tango of Roxanne&quot; and a medley of 90's and 80's songs including a very comedic sequence using Madonna's &quot;Like A Virgin.&quot; The Paris sequences are excellent, the tenement slums, the elegant Moulin Rouge and Satine's elephant house, with close ups and aireal views providing the backdrop for this tragic love story. In a subtle manner, Luhrman is giving a young audience their first taste of opera. Verdi's La Traviata is the story of a young man who is a lot like Christian who falls for a courtesan dying of consumption a lot like Satine is. The conflict between the Duke, his obsessive desire to claim Satine for his own, and Christian's pure love, is finally resolved in the last scenes, only to our dismay we realize that for Satine, it is too late. The Christina Aguilera, Lil' Kim, Maya remake of the Patti Labelle classic &quot;Lady Marmalade&quot;, which was the number song last summer, is fitting to the extravagance and decadence of the can-can dancers and entertainment performed at the Moulin Rouge. This film is extraordinary. You willbe instantly in love with the music, the story, and the breathtaken beauty that is Moulin Rouge. Another triumph for Baz Luhrman. What will he come up with next ?
B00005R2M3|2.0|Amongst the many inexplicably mediocre tracks on Shakira's first English CD, 'Poem to a horse' stands out as especially embarrassing. While Shakira's marketing team has been insisting that she wrote ALL the lyrics on this album, they needn't have tried that hard to convince us. Every line reeks of second-language syndrome, and while this may be 'quaint' to some people, to me it was just plain bad. This is not the kind of music or lyrical content that the world needs right now.<br />I must say though that I do love Shakira. I first saw her performing on TV while I was in Southern India - the track was off her second Spanish album, which I bought right after I saw her on television. Which is why I am especially disappointed in this new effort....<br />There are two things that made me love the early Shakira - one, her voice, which was earthy, Middle-Eastern influenced, and extremely versatile. Second was her music itself - always steeped in Eastern rhythms, with the trace of alterna-diva popping out every now and then. This was the music she should have made. Instead, 'Laundry Service' is very reminiscent of Britney Spears' debut album 'Baby... One more time' with none of the pep and vigor. How unappealing is THAT?<br />The lead track here is a dull little 'latin' number called 'Objection (Tango)', which sounds like something Jennifer Lopez left off the J.Lo Sessions. The two somewhat listenable tracks here are 'Underneath your clothes' and 'Eyes like yours' (not to be confused with the more listenable 'Eyes like twins' by Wilson Phillips). Then theres also something called 'The One'... which reads like a child's attempts at tidying up the nursery.<br />The lead single is called 'Whenever, wherever' which also appears as 'Suerte', the Spanish version of the song. If you're buying the CD based on this track, be warned that it's the only thing on here worth listening to. The lyrics are trite, utter garbage. Just listen to the deathly sick lines of 'Poem to a horse' and you'll get what I mean :<br />\\"I'd rather eat my soup with a fork / Or drive a cab to New York / Cuz to talk to you is harder work \\". Later in the track, she moans : \\"You keep on aiming for the top / And quit before you sweat a drop.Feed your empty brain with your hydroponic pot.\\" It's a good thing Shakira didn't take English in university or her parents would well be lamenting the waste of all their hard-earned money. This is beyond embarrassing, and way beyond bad.<br />Unfortunately, Shakira's album is not so bad that it could qualify as a campy classic. It doesn't have the ultra kitschy vibe that would make it an underground hit either. Come to think of it, it doesn't have much of anything, which is suprising, since the earlier efforts of the artist at songwriting have always been remarkable.<br />To sum it up, let me quote from Shakira's own pen. This is from the first track on the album called 'Objection' :<br />\\"This is pathetic / And sardonic / And sadistic / And psychotic / Tango is not for fun / Was never meant to be / But you can try it / Rehearse it / Or train like a horse / But don't you count on me / Don't you count on me boy\\"<br />Don't hate yourself. Pass this one up and wait for Shakira's next album. It's bound to be better. Heaven knows, it can't get any worse.you'll get what I mean :<br />\\"I'd rather eat my soup with a fork / Or drive a cab to New York / Cuz to talk to you is harder work \\".

B00003CXXR|5.0|This JP movie was so cool.  Sam Neil comes back for another film.  Although short (1 hour 30 minutes) still great.  A definite buy.  New dinosaurs, and GREAT effects.  JP and The Lost World where good, but man this one was GREAT!!!!!!!!  It'll keep you at the edge of your seat biting your fingernails.
B0000024R8|5.0|This cd is probably his most underappreciated and one of his best.  He sings folk music with great heart and shows everyone what to expect in his future years.  I can listen to this cd forever.  It is a must have for any true Bob Dylan fan.  It is true that he did not write most of the songs on this album, but he gives these traditional songs his own flair. Pretty Peggy-O, Baby Let Me Follow You Down, Freight Train Blues, and House of the Risin' Sun are some of these great traditional songs. But don't panic! He also gives us hints of his great songwriting ability with Talkin' New York and Song to Woody (A tribute to his hero Woody Guthrie).  This first album is ignored too much, and should be seen for its true greatness!!
B000002HAJ|5.0|i have one word for this album...  amazing.  the depth of feeling in the lyrics and music makes me shiver every time i listen to it...
B00003CXTF|4.0|This movie was great, and by the end of the movie i really was crying. The movie is a kind of movie you only have to see once, though. Eveyone says either awesome! they are so cute, or i hated it! it is so boring! It doesn't have to be either<br />Yeah, there were somethings wrong for it, but there were many things that i didn't know about this attack, and learned. <br />I think this movie is a must see movie (but that doesn't mean its necessarily the bast movie, just one you have to see).
B00003CXZ4|5.0|I am facinated by this movie.  The very fact that the director chose to assemble it in a fashion which is almost HOSTILE to the average viewer (i.e. the general public, which generally seems to want watch something they can predict from beginning to end, the first time they see it...) makes me think that this film should be admired.  <BR>I give it ten punk points for sheer nerve.  <BR>If you've never seen the film, suffice to say that the first time you watch it, you will most likely be lost much of the time.. but the story unfolds in such a way that you don't really care.  <BR>And the second time you see it?  Well, if you aren't the type to watch a movie twice, get ready to change that habit at least this once, because you will get more the second time.  <BR>The structure, story, and conventions used in telling the story contained in this movie are amazing, frankly.  The main character has been rendered incapable of forming new memories, but still remembers his past.  The trick is, and this is fiendishly clever... the movie takes place in a series of two to three minute chunks, which is about the amount of time it takes to form a new memory.  <BR>what was i saying? <BR>why am i running...?<BR>oh, i'm chasing that guy.<BR>*blam!*<BR>oh, he's chasing me...
B00005U11Z|5.0|JOURNEY 2001 - From the casual fan, to the 80's fanatic, to the diehard Journey follower, this DVD is for you.   Neal Schon, Ross Valory, Jonathan Cain, Deen Castronovo and Steve Augeri are all here to make this the ultimate Journey experience!  Kevin Shirley has done a fantastic job with this DVD.  The picture quality and sound are amazing.  Watching this DVD is just as good as being there.   Journey's singer, Steve Augeri, has made the old hits his own, and the new material from their album, &quot;Arrival&quot;, is my favorite new music of 2001.  I bought both the DVD and VHS versions and it was well worth every penny.  Want to rock?  Get this DVD.  Want to chill out with a love song?  Get this DVD.  Just want to have a good time?  Get this DVD.   In fact, you don't need a reason, just get this DVD!!  And while you are there, pick up Arrival too!
B00003CXTF|5.0|I avoided seeing this in the theatres because of the bad reviews it got. After renting it I was sorry I didn't see it in the theatre. It is a beautiful story of 3 peoples lives during pre-WWII. I got a good feel of what it was like in that era. The actual bombing didn't enter the movie until much later. It was an incredible recreation. If you are looking for just a &quot;war movie&quot; than you will more than likely be dissapointed. The movie would have done much better if trailers didn't misportray (is that a word?) what the main plot of the movie is. All in all I would really recommend trying out this movie. You may be as pleasantly as I was.

B0000033P2|5.0|Trilogy finds ELP at a more harnessed, yet still experimental and progressive format, as this offering is not as harsh and abrasive sounding as Pictures at an Exhibition. It seems more clean, crisp and refined, yet still encompassing the complex and manic keyboard flourishes of Keith Emerson. It also has the more elegant Greg Lake pieces (In The Beginning), and Carl Palmer's fabulous drumming. You get quirky numbers like The Sheriff, which features a crazed, yet humorous piano solo what I would describe as \\"wild west ragtime\\" at the end. Man, Keith Emerson can play the hell out of his instrument. Hoedown, if you remember the \\"Beef, it's what's for dinner\\" commercial, then you'll know this is a unique remake of a classical piece. This one is a more rocked up version. Trilogy is one of the prog-rock epics on the disc. It almost has a latin-like feel to it in the way Greg Lake delivers his vocals against Keith's synths and the percussion used in the last few minutes. Living Sin is a great tune. My only complaint is the annoying dark-pitched vocals. Abaddon's Bolero is a synth experiment and is all instrumental clocking in at 8 minutes. And it all starts out with The Endless Enigma, a 10 minute prog fest spread across the first three tracks. This is my favorite from the disc. This truly has some creepy parts in it. Not the least of it is brought on by Keith Emerson's synths. It truly has a creepy last second synth echo that you just can't get out of your head, at least for me.<br />Overall, a fine offering from ELP. This was my second purchase and I look forward to owning more ELP discs, as they have become a new favorite of mine.
B000002BSG|4.0|Overall, the CD is wonderful.  Jamiroquai know how to lay down a contageous groove.  The first part of the CD live up to this, but near the end, the tracks with the digeredoos are quite a bit off from the feel of the rest of the album.
B000059XYM|2.0|Scary movie was a sad attempt to satarize real &quot;scary movies.&quot; In addition to it's predictability, it was filled with bland humor. Oh yes, some parts did make you smile, perhaps even giggle, but over all it was a waste of my $7.00. It's only one of many movies today making an effort to mock popular teen movies. My suggestion, see a real teen movie. Because you know the joke you're in for when you go to see it.
0312243022|4.0|I found this novel very enjoyable. It refers to homosexuality alot, so if you are offended by such content you should find a different book. However, I loved the novel and I had never read Mrs. Dalloway or any of Virginia Woolf's books. I had also never read a Michael Cunningham book. I read the novel in two days, I could NOT put it down!
B00004Z459|5.0|I first saw a commercial for MTV's Return To Rock 2 CD and I saw Linkin Park's video, One Step Closer. I thought oh wow, they look pretty good. The next day or so I went to my local Kmart and purchased the CD and was completely amazed that there was no explicit lyric sticker on the front. I listened to it once through and I thought the CD was amazing! Though there is no swearing of any kind they still rock on. Most bands they are in the same genre as them usually swear, like LimpBizkit. From that first time, Papercut, #8 In The End, #9 A Place For My Head, #6 Runaway, and #5 instantly stuck out at me. I enjoy this CD very much and Linkin Park is my favorite band b/c I like how all their songs are about universal negative emotions that are n life. They don't have stupid oh I'm in love songs, which a lot of songs are turning into now a day. They aren't afraid to express the emotions that they and other people feel and I think it is great b/c we don't have enough of that. If you had a bad day and you're frustrated, angry, mad,..., etc etc this is a great album to listen to...And Hybrid Theory fits well with Linkin Park. B/c their sound is a hybrid of different music genres. their is rock, techno, hiphop, etc etc. And it all goes well together. The entire album is great and you can listen to from start to finish without skipping any songs, unless some of the yelling bothers you..
B00003CXXJ|3.0|When you watch Shrek you will be amazed at the artistic genius that allows this computerized world to come to life.  Never had a cartoon world looked so real.  You could spend hours marvelling at the attention to detail the creators of this movie gave.<br />But if you take away all of the ground breaking animation, what you have is an average movie.  Mike Myers voices Shrek and does a great job but from the first scenes we know Shrek in an Ogre who only appears mean to hide the low self esteem he harbors.  Nothing new here.<br />Eddie Murphy voices the donkey, the trusty side kick to Shrek who always has a wise crack to make but is truly Shreks friend when it counts.<br />Then there is Princess Fiona.  She is your typical princess in a fairy tale, waiting to be rescued by her Prince Charming.<br />Shrek could never decide what kind of movie it wanted to be.  Parts of it are satire on Disney films, parts are satire on fairy tales, and parts are blatant morality tales.  If the creators had settled on one path, they would have had a better movie...<br />Maybe I'm so down on this movie because others love it so much.  This is a good movie, just not the best movie that was ever made.  Of course I'm an adult.  Kids will love it.
B00005OWIU|4.0|Even if I didn't like Harry Potter, I would have still bought this soundtrack, for the reason of it is done by John Williams.  I have so many soundtracks by Mr. Williams that its not surprise that I bought this one.  Oh it is just such a plus that it is the Harry Potter soundtrack and by John Williams....guess I should go and see the movie.
B000002KAT|2.0|This album gets a lot of lip service from critics and fans alike.<BR>Yet, to these ears this album is not one of Morrison's best.<br />While it is true that for 1968 this album represented unchartered territory for a &quot;Rock&quot; musician, the mere presence of jazz musicians playing acoustic instruments does not a classic make.<br />The rhythm section, instead of providing a solid foundation for Van's jazzy vocal embellishments, wanders all over the place, with bass runs, piano, guitar chords &amp; Morrison's vocal all competing  for the spotlight.<br />Morrison's scatting sounds as good as ever, it's just that there's no rhythmic glue to hold all the pieces together. The result is a cluttered mess that trips all over itself.<br />Then there's the lyrics:<BR>Morrison's vision here is a cloudy one, and while the dreamy atmosphere sounds inviting at first, it quickly becomes tiresome and repetitious, as it is impossible to decipher what the heck he's talking about.<br />In the days of vinyl, the 2 sides of the LP were sub-titled &quot;Before&quot; and &quot;Afterwards&quot;. I am at a loss to even guess what these refer to, and it seems I'm not the only one: Van Morrison himself said in later years that the record company mixed up the two, and the song cycle labelled &quot;Before&quot; was really &quot;Afterwards&quot;, and vice-versa.<br />Van Morrison was to go on to utilize extended jazz forms much more effectively in future years. And I'm not talking about &quot;Moondance&quot;.<BR>Check out &quot;When Heart Is Open&quot; and &quot;Wild Honey&quot; from 1980's &quot;Common One&quot;; or &quot;Listen To The Lion&quot; from 1972's &quot;St. Dominic's Preview&quot;.<br />I hate to knock idols off their pedestals, but...clink.
B00005RFAI|5.0|First, I have to let you all know that I am not a fan of pop music. I can't stand TRL, Britney Spears, or any of the like. I've never liked any of Pink's previous recordings. Overplayed, TRL-worthy fluff. After being recommended to download a few songs, I wearily obliged. I'm shocked. Songs like &quot;Just Like a Pill&quot; and &quot;Don't Let me Get Me&quot; are suprisingly deep and well sang. Pink really shows off her vocal talents on this album.
B000000H64|5.0|All right everybody, listen up: If you've had it with all the crap \\"nu-metal\\" bands like Limp Bizkit, Staind, Slipknot, Linkin Park and Papa Roach, you need to buy Demanufacture by Fear Factory.  This is one of the best CDs that I have ever bought, and I should know, I own over 750 CDs.  I listen to this CD at least once a day, if not more.  One of the best songs (if I can even narrow it down, because they all kick butt) is Self Bias Resistor, which has one of the most haunting endings that I have ever heard in a song.  Just do yourself a favor and spend the $... bucks to add this to your collection.  You won't be sorry.  I think that Burton C. Bell (lead singer) says it best in the introduction to Replica on the Ozzfest 2000 CD...if you've ever heard that, you know what I'm talking about!  Fear Factory rules!!!!!
B00005A1PR|4.0|How refreshing! One listen to this beautifully crafted cd and I was hooked! Much like her fellow neo soul compatriots Alicia Keys and Jill Scott, India.Arie paints an image of her soul and allows you to gaze upon it and marvel in it. Her feeling is deep and it touches your heart. It's real. It kind of makes you puzzle over the name of Badu who???<br />     The cd pays tribute to soul singers and trailblazers of years past. It does not copy or imitate, yet instead it builds upon their musical legacies. The sassy first single 'Video' is definitely a song which could prove to help the self esteem of all those young people who feel they are not as they should be because they don't see an image like themselves glamorized on television...not just for young girls! The next single, 'Brown Skin' is India's ode to her love of the soft brown skin of her soul mate..a craving and a longing which also helps her feel complete once joined together with her own. She coos, &quot;beautiful mahogany, you make me feel like a queen...&quot; Even deeper is the uplifting 'Strength, Courage and Wisdom'. This songs is so marvelously emboldeing and majestic that it's almost overwhelming. Yet Arie is not only about the uplifting..she dabbles in love as well. Songs like 'I am Ready For Love' and &quot;I See God in You' show her affinity for the art of love as well as her longing for passion and the tender moments. Another stand out track is the uptempo 'Part of My Life' on which the singer questions whether her love interest is all about the physical or if he wants to be an ever bigger, more emotionally bound part of her life. She questions, &quot;I want to know that I can be free with you...You've got to show that you're worthy of my time! Can you stimulate my mind?&quot; I defy her love interest to tell her he is all about the physical! <br />     One of the best r&amp;b/soul releases of the year, you would be remiss if you don't add 'Acoustic Soul' to your cd library. It's touching, uplifting, and you will feel as if you and India.Arie have some sort of shared experience. It will always be in your playlist.
B00004XOWM|5.0|... I LOVE this album.  I think it is one of my all-time favorite albums.  I have all 4 of Limp's albums and I've been a fan ever since I heard \\"Faith.\\"  1st album was cool...2nd album was very cool...3rd was GREAT...and the 4th...well...it was ok...it has some sweet remixes of the hits on their first 3 albums.  Personally...I think the band is getting better and better with each album that they put out.  \\"Chocolate Starfish...\\" isn't thrash music like the 1st album...it's got more hiphop beats with guitars.  I love this stuff.  They even have some rappers appearing on the album...Xzibit, DMX, Redman, and more.  I think it's great as I said.  My favorite songs on the album is \\"Hotdog\\"...which quotes Nine Inch Nails, \\"Full Nelson\\", both versions of \\"Rollin\\", \\"Livin' It Up\\", \\"Getcha Groove On\\", and my absolute fav...I fell in love with this song...it just hit me...\\"Boiler.\\" If you like Limp...get the album...support Fred and the boys.  They rule.  They will ALWAYS rule.
0385495323|5.0|I've been interested in cryptography for a while, but always a little overwhelmed. A friend recommended this as an explanation of PGP; I was interested but sceptical. <br />Mr. Singh blew me away. He has written an incredibly engaging book by combining the theory, practice, history and mystery of codes and code-breaking. It is an excellent introduction to cryptography. It starts with simple ancient methods and then explains their strengths and weaknesses politically and mathematically using historical examples. Then we learn more advanced methods with their reasons and histories. I was actually day-dreaming about being a mathematician. Who would have thought.<br />Wonderful.
0446677450|5.0|This book is full of the most basic common sense about making progress in this world driven by money. This is not a book that celebrates greed and it will make you feel good about becoming financially independent. I highly recommend getting &quot;The Child Whisperer&quot; by Matt Pasquinilli when you buy this book. &quot;The Child Whisperer&quot; lays a foundation of confidence and communication skills that are necessary for a person wanting to employ the advice in &quot;Rich Dad, Poor Dad.&quot; Both books will compliment each other and have a lot in common.
0385483821|5.0|i bought this book because i'm in the chip industry and i wanted to learn from one of the masters in the field.  i have to say that his teachings apply not only to people in the tech industry but to anyone with a yearning to be on top.  great book!  go buy it!
B000059MEK|5.0|Maybe cheesy 80's electro should have ended with the Reagan administration, but the French duo add fabulous hooks, incredible production, and a poinancy to make this album the choice for dance music fans.  &quot;Discovery&quot; starts out with &quot;One More Time.&quot; A fitting title to start a Daft Punk album.  It's one more time to take a delicious pop hook, apply a beat, cover it with a luscious vocal and let it loose upon the world.  The song speaks of celebration; a good song for these times. &quot;Harder, Better, Faster, Stronger&quot; is my pick for best produced song.  The vocals are chopped up and mapped onto keyboards and guitars.  You hear the instruments, but you also hear the words.  It's mind bending.  &quot;Digital Love&quot; and &quot;Something About Us&quot; track to the romantic side.  Cheesy, yes, but completely addictive.
B00005JKT8|2.0|Went with a few other late 20's early 30's couples and we all found it boring. Yes it is a cute romantic typical date flick.  But it just goes on and on and despite a couple of good lines is generally a weak flick.  I usually rate movies 4 ways.  Worth $8.50, worth a matinee, good rental, and a waste of $4.  This one is a good rental.  Don't waste the big bucks at the theater.
0060925000|5.0|Someone thrust this book at me with the command, &quot;Read this.&quot; I usually disliked being forced upon but the days have been dreary so I started reading the book. From the first poetic 'acknowlegement' and 'contents', I was hooked.<br />Who is Vikram Seth and how is it possible that he is able to play with words that makes me laugh for joy? If you want to read a sypnosis, read the above reviews; if you want to read a response then read my incoherent ramble. <br />I feel transported to an India that is a little familar--I, too, am a child whose country was once colonized by the British--Lord, do I know of Chivas marmalade, Quink washable royal blue ink etc--Seth's dialogue is peppered with &quot;two tight slaps&quot; that I remember my dear mama promised me if I misbehaved. The dialogue, the strangeness of looking up to a race that despises you is all too familar and sad to me, and yet I can understand. I know why Meenakshi buys British and not rationed goods. (Hmmm... it's time to reread Jamaica Kincaid's excellent &quot;A Small Place&quot; to remind me of the effects of colonialism)<br />Not having read Seth's poems, I love his poetic prose (sounds trite, but this is the only way I can seem to define his narrative style) His words are consonant-rich, embedded with vowels and multisylablles that sing even as you read them out loud. He has a marvelous and playful sense with words; to have them would seem to be enough, but to have them AND create a rich story like this humbles me.<br />The book reminds me of Spenser's Faery Queen, with the characters appearing and disapppearing in gallant prose. I also think of Cao Xue Qin's Story of the Stone, a rich 17th century Chinese saga of multi-families and gender issues. I feel so happy to have read this! But be glad I won't attempt a couplet like the Chaaterji children ...
B00005QZ7U|5.0|There are however a few requirements you probably have to meet if you're going to enjoy this film.<BR>1.  You have to know Baz Luhrman's film style, it's very unique.  You also have to be able to get his humor.<BR>2.  You have to love musicals obviously.  And musicals that are a stretch, seeing how this one is like no other I've ever seen.<BR>3.  You also must realise this film got a love/hate reaction, either you're going to be completely obsessed or you're going to think it's terrible.<BR>Now that that is over, I'll say why I liked it.  A lot of reviews here seem to say that the two main actors (Nicole Kidman and Ewan McGregor) have no chemistry and cannot sing.  I guess this is a matter of opinion, becuase I think they are gorgeous together and they both have beautiful voices.  I saw this four times in the theatres, and every time something very dramatic happened, or there was a very important part, the audience reacted heavily.  This was the only movie I've ever seen in theatres that caused the audience to have a very visible reaction.  And as I left each time I noticed over half the people were crying.  People you don't usually see crying too, like college guys and stuff.  <BR>One thing that has also been heavily criticized about Moulin Rouge is the fast paced filming style.  Baz Luhrman used a unique panning in and out and just moving really fast style to create an atmosphere.  By making what's onscreen appear fantastical, he keeps the audience aware that they're watching a movie, yet also lets them feel as if they're a part of it.<BR>If you already knew you liked the movie, I definetely suggest the DVD.  There is so much extra stuff on the second disk, and also on the first there are two different audio commentaries.  I usually don't like those commentaries, but at least one is really fun because it lets you go behind the scenes of only certain scenes to see how they were made.  The HBO Making Of special is also included, which is great.<BR>If you're still wondering, &quot;This story is about love.&quot;  I think it's one of the greatest love stories ever told, and anyone with an open mind would like it.
B00005O5CM|5.0|I had viewed \\"Legally Blonde\\" twice at one of my local cinemas and found it to be quite an enjoyable romp.  Reese Witherspoon had fantastic charisma and carried the picture.  When I saw that MGM Studios had released a Special Edition on DVD, I found I just couldn't resist it...  I went out and purchased a copy.  I must say, I cannot regret that decision.  Despite the fact I paid a bit more than I would have liked, I found that I was compensated for it, by the seemingly endless array of special features that I had the pleasure to discover.  Not to mention I also found a coupon for two dollars and fifty cents off a bottle of Nicole nail polish enclosed.   So, all in all \\"Legally Blonde\\" has a quality about it that makes it worth a look.  And although some scenes may be questionable for children, it is generally a feel-good film that can be enjoyed by the entire family.
0783225857|5.0|One of the GREATEST MOVIES of all time!!. A &quot;truly rare movie&quot; production.. I would like to see more movies produced like this  in the future (Probably impossible with the current actors and astresses, producers, directors and manuscripts.
0446608955|1.0|I kept seeing Sparks' stuff on the bestseller lists, so I thought I would check one out. I found it to be sentimental, manipulative, cliched, poorly written, predictable, and unoriginal. It's hard to imagine that stuff like this is so successful.
0786880708|5.0|I read this book about nine months ago. For me, it was the right book at the right time. <br />This book instructed and inspired me to begin a daily practice of mindfulness meditation. This simple practice changed my life and my relationship with the world. Now there is less struggle, more awareness, acceptance of paradox, and I'm less apt to get caught up in the thinking and story-lines that dominated my existence.
B00000HYXB|5.0|There is an underlying feel to this album that is inescapable. I have listen to this album ad-nauseum since my purchase three years ago. I found it pertinent to type this review in light of the new movie released &quot;Lord of the Rings&quot;. The music is definitely a companion to the movie and adds to the overall understanding and emotion of the world call Middle Earth. Yet these two different mediums can stand on their own. The music on this album is pure escapism. The folk elements within the belly of this monster alone are worth the price payed for it. Blind Guardian has captured something (which I can't quite put my ring finger on) in their melodies and hard driving riffs. I thought that concept albums this &quot;colorful&quot; were a thing of the past. I was wrong. Bards you have been, bards you are, bards you will always be.
B000002TQV|5.0|This is absolutely one of the best recordings of the last decade. Every song on this album is top notch with beautiful vocals from Thom Yorke. Simply put, there comes along every so often a band that actually cares about the music they make and are good at it. Radiohead is in an elite class of musicians. They are the one band that this generation will remember for a long time. They are in one word...genius.
B00000F566|5.0|I loved Dirty Dancing from the first time I saw it over a decade ago.  This movie is what made Patrick Swayze hot for me (I was a teenager when it came out).  I think what makes this movie so great is it's outstanding music.  It makes you want to dance!  I am puzzled, however, that it is in the future release section.  I already own the Collector's Edition version and have for some time.  At first I thought, &quot;Oh great, they are re-releasing a DVD I already own and they're putting other neat stuff on it-something which seems to happen ALOT (I.e.:  American Pie, The Mummy, Pretty Woman, etc..).&quot;  I'm happy to report that the copy I have is the same as the one being released in January, 2002.  The behind the scenes &quot;stuff&quot; makes switching to DVD's a very smart decision, indeed.
0446608955|2.0|. . . if you like schmaltzy love stories. It's so predictable, I had the whole thing figured out by page forty. While predictable isn't necessarily bad by itself, add it to cardboard, cliched characters and bad writing, and you've got a disaster waiting to happen. <BR>This is supposed to be adult fiction?! I've read more mature young adult fiction than this. And did anyone else find it irritating how the author kept writing \\"It wasn't until later that I would learn the reason why.\\" He put that in the book like four times. I get the point already. Also, at the end of the book, when Landon told how Jamie had brought he and his father together again, but they never show it happening in the book. One moment they hate each other, the next they're a happy family.<BR>I think it is presumptuous to tell the audience at the beginning of the book, \\"First you will smile and then you will cry,\\" because I did neither, even though I am usually a pretty sentimental person. I didn't give this book one star, because it isn't the worst book I've ever read, and also the writing seemed to get slightly better by the end of the book (perhaps because he stopped trying to make humorous similes). Bottom line: I would't recommend this book to anyone.
B00005O5CM|5.0|I agree with other reviews that this is a movie you must see if you liked &quot;Clueless.&quot;  Yet, although Elle Woods (Reese Witherspoon) acts clueless at times, she is actually very smart.  This movie is full of hilarious lines (&quot;whoever said orange was the new pink was seriously disturbed!&quot;), lots of laughs, and a strange view of what college life is about.  But Reese Witherspoon, a fantastic actress in my opinion, has another great role in this movie.  A dumb blonde who is actually not blonde.  A blonde who can do anything.  A blonde who will take over the world!<br />Elle Woods, sorority president, fashion major and owner of a chihuahua, expects the love of her life to propose to her, but instead he breaks up with her, telling her that he cannot be with her since she is not a Jackie Kennedy Onasis, but a Marilyn Monroe.  Since he is going off to Harvard law with aspirations to be a senator, Elle decides that the way to win him back is to enter Harvard law school as well.  And, amazingly, this blonde gets in with a hilarious admittence video and a very impressive LSAT score.  Yet, when Elle arrives at Harvard, she realizes that being a lawyer may be more appropriate for her than a Victoria Secrets model.  Definately recommend this movie for everyone.  It is pretty predictable, but who cares?  It still is entertaining until the end.
B00005JKT8|5.0|Much to my surprise, this personable time travel romance is the hidden gem of the holiday season.   Of course, the plot - handsome 19th century duke travels to the 20th century where he meets driven but unfulfilled career woman - does require a certain suspension of disbelief.  If you can accept the premise, the rest of the story is predictable but charmingly executed.  The dialoque is witty and clever, and the acting is first-rate.  Hugh Jackman is yummy as the duke, and Meg Ryan is Meg Ryan; the supporting cast is terrific.  The writers have wisely mixed comedic and romantic scenes.  My only reservation is the internal inconsistencies and improbabilities - I was particularly distracted by the idea that a 19th century duke would have the faintest idea of how to cook dinner.  Extra credit for most entertaining use of a &quot;sign here&quot; sticker.
B000006MS3|5.0|In her first three albums (THE KICK INSIDE, LIONHEART, and NEVER FOREVER) Bush established herself as an etherial-voiced, highly accomplished artist with a penchant for the macabre; in THE DREAMING she suddenly sheds the deliberately adopted artifice of her earlier work and simply explodes as a truly great iconoclastic musician of extraordinary vision with a ferocious passion that would daunt even the likes of American contemporary Patti Smith.  The entire album is slickly done in terms of music; the sound, which relies a great deal on percussion and bass lines and synthesizers, is at once as smooth as spit and polish can make it and yet as emotionally raw as a gaping wound.  And each track, although extremely diverse in terms of material, feeds into the overwhelming power of the album as a whole.<br /><br />Always attracted to macabre and violent imagery, Bush finally takes off her velvet gloves and reaches directly into some very dark material indeed: the futility of knowledge and the frustration of ambition, the spider-like evil of war and the destructiveness of colonialism, and the invasion of personal space made by modern society.  The vehicles by which she conveys these themes are amazing: an American solider stalked by a Vietcong, presented from the Vietcong's point of view (Pull Out The Pin), a botched bank robbery (There Goes A Tenner), the adventures of a drug smuggler (Night of the Swallow), the ecological and social carelessness of the English in Australia (The Dreaming.)  The result is surrealistic, horrific, passionate, and hypnotically fascinating from start to finish, and the passage of time has not so much dimmed its power as enhanced it.<br /><br />A great many people--including many who count themselves fans of both her earlier and later work--loathe this particular recording for its dissonance (a friend who walked in upon me one day while I was listening to it actually mistook Bush for Yoko Ono) and violence, but love it or hate it Bush's THE DREAMING far outreaches the similar-sounding SECURITY and SO by Peter Gabriel, and it remains a landmark of 20th Century high-art music.<br /><br />GFT, Amazon Reviewerches the similar-sounding SECURITY and SO by Peter Gabriel, and it remains a landmark of 20th Century high-art music.

6304479689|4.0|I'm a avid Elvis fan. It's hard for me to give this 4stars than 5stars but I have to admit, sadly he was not himself at this point. His prsonal life was affecting him greatly. Only 2 month before this tour, his wife walked out on him for other man. Life of being a performer and an entertainer is hard especially at his caliber. Also being a biggest hunk and sexsymbol like him to be humiliated in publicly like he had, I couldn't help sympathizing him. Anybody can tell the difference from That's The Way It Is which was taken in summer of 1970 in Las Vegas.<BR>Up to 1971 Elvis gave absolutely stunning performances. In 1970 film, you can see the best of Elvis of all time. It came out with special DVD version, newly found films are added. I'd recomend this one instead of Elvis on Tour but you can find out what the Elvis's tour was like. This is a good documentary film and some of great numbers towards the end are enjoyable.
0783230893|3.0|Fannie Flag's interesting novel gets a gallon of gloss in this very Hollywood movie clearly created with a female audience in mind. The result is a well performed but somewhat uneasy mixture of sentiment, comedy and soap opera.<br />In terms of story, the film operates on two levels. An increasingly frustrated middleaged woman living in Alabama (Bates) examine her life and finds it sadly lacking--but by chance she makes the acquaintance of a nursing home resident (Tandy) whose stories of the past encourage the woman to take charge of her life. The stories she tells are shown through flashback, and concern two depression-era women (Mary Louise Parker and Mary Stuart Masterson) who owned and operated a ramshackle diner in a small hard-times town called whistle stop. The present-day story emphasises comedy while the depression-era story tends more toward soap opera elements, and the two stories sometimes prove an uneasy mix. A great fuss is often made over the implied lesbian relationship between the two leads in the depression-era story, but I myself find this more in the eye of the beholder than in the actual film; it rather depends on how you read the characters.<br />Much of the film is enjoyable, particularly in its performances with Bates a standout. The dreamy quality in which the depression-era story is presented is also nicely done. But the action is sometimes slow and the tone is both predictable and manipulative; I can almost hear the director telling me \\"laugh now; cry now\\" as the film progresses. Enjoyable for one, perhaps even two viewings, but not a film to which I greatly care to return--I'll take the more interesting novel instead.
B000002JSV|5.0|Without a doubt Powerage was AC/DC's best album. It just boggles my mind how this album is ignored while the inferior Highway to Hell gets all the glory. Ever track on this album is great, with absolutely no filler. Even though this entire album is great, the standouts are Down Payment Blues, Riff Raff, Sin City, What's Next to the Moon and Kicked in the Teeth. overall this album is NOT to be missed...get it now now! NOW!!!!
B000007MVL|4.0|In many respects superior to her considerably more freely styled debut album THE KICK INSIDE, LIONHEART finds Kate Bush in complete control of both her unique voice and material as well as expanding upon the possibilities of both.<br />As on THE KICK INSIDE and the later NEVER FOREVER, Bush continues to use a high soprano that sounds very much like what you'd expect of a strange night creature: high, mewling, the essence of femininity, and yet suddenly descending into an enjoyably disconcerting alto of considerable power.  The opening tracks, &quot;Symphony in Blue&quot; and &quot;In Search of Peter Pan,&quot; sound very much like the Kate Bush we've come to expect from the THE KICK INSIDE--but other tracks elaborate much more clearly upon the darkly gothic touches found in the earlier album.  It is here in this mix of strange wonder, dark imagery, and the singer's vocal convolutions that we find true magic.  &quot;Wow&quot; combines Bush's unique voice with some of her most powerful imagery to that date; &quot;Don't Push Your Foot On The Heartbrake,&quot; which compares being in love to being in a car crash, drifts effortlessly from etherial delicacy to disturbingly shrill and back again; and such tracks as &quot;Coffee Homeground&quot; and &quot;Hammer Horror&quot; play off her vocal delicacy against powerfully macrabre and frequently erotic lyrics.<br />Perhaps the most celebrated track from this collection is &quot;Lionheart,&quot; a gently performed melody with a lullaby feel which expresses a dying World War II pilot's thoughts about England.  Bush is a distinctly English artist who frequently references literary material and history, and this is nowhere seen to greater advantage in the overall body of her work than in this particular piece.  Once heard, Kate Bush's work remains hauntingly in mind, and in LIONHEART we find perhaps the best expression of her early recordings.  Certainly an album to cherish.
0446608955|5.0|I read this book in one day.  I could not put it down.  I thought the story was amazing.  It made me want to be more like Jamie.  She was such a generous person.  Nicholas Sparks can make you have so many different emotions if you read this book.  I reconmend this book to anyone who wants to hear a heart-touching story.  You will not forget it.  I can't wait for the movie!
B00000DQSS|4.0|Although it clearly belongs to the same style as the previous THE KICK INSIDE and LIONHEART, NEVER FOR EVER marks a decided change in Kate Bush's direction; less whimsical and considerably more overtly macabre, on this particular recording Bush largely eschews both the purely playful and the warm love songs of previous recordings.  Her tone of voice is also fuller and considerably less girlish than on previous recordings.<br /><br />The material here is also considerably more violent in terms of lyrics.  In her previous recordings Bush certainly showed a tendency toward images of impending or actual death (&#34;James and the Cold Gun&#34; and &#34;Don't Push Your Foot On The Heartbrake&#34; leap to mind), but in NEVER FOREVER she is less inclined to present such pieces as &#34;character pieces,&#34; less inclined to romanticize them with a gothic flavor.  And irony, never far beneath the surface in earlier work, is much more apparent.<br /><br />Such tracks as &#34;Violin&#34; (concerning a neurotic/erotic obsession with the instrument, in which Bush's voice mimics the tone of the instrument), &#34;Wedding List,&#34; (in which a frustrated bride contemplates the slaughter of the whole wedding party), and &#34;Breathing&#34; (in which the singer is dying of radium poisoning following an atomic blast) are perhaps the logical extensions of Bush's earlier work; at the same time, with such tracks as &#34;All We Ever Look For&#34; and &#34;Army Dreamers,&#34; we begin to see a transition from material based on internal private fantasy into something much broader and considerably more subtle: deliberate commentary on the world around her.  This is particularly true of &#34;Army Dreamers,&#34; which is very clearly a percusor to her next album, THE DREAMING--which will be a radical departure from her earlier sound.<br /><br />Even as she is toying with new dimensions in her lyrics and vocal interpretations, Bush is also toying with increasingly complex arrangements.  There is a sense of greater delicacy and greater deliberation in terms of pure music on this particular recording, again with &#34;Army Dreamers&#34; a case in point.  Fans of the earlier recordings will find enough similarity to them in NEVER FOR EVER to enjoy them as a continuation; fans of her later work, however, will see in it the build toward her two finest recordings, THE DREAMING and HOUNDS OF LOVE, both of which are as completely unlike her early works as can be imagined.<br /><br />GFT, Amazon Reviewerand greater deliberation in terms of pure music on this particular recording, again with &#34;Army Dreamers&#34; a case in point.

B00005QK3W|4.0|I've seen a lot of reviews that praise Driving Rain as being better than Flaming Pie, but it just isn't so.  Song for song, Flaming Pie had an aura about it, perhaps a reflection of the Beatles Anthology, that made it sound as new and different as anything Paul has done since Band On The Run with the exception of maybe Tug of War.  Driving Rain is good, but I wouldn't put it in the same class as those albums.  It reminds me of Flowers In The Dirt...he gets credit for trying, but doesn't quite make it.<br />Maybe we're asking too much of Paul since no matter what he does will always be flavored by the Beatles and his better Wings albums.  Can we really expect someone to consistently produce excellent music for forty-plus years?  Well, sure we can but it ain't gonna happen.  The problem with Driving Rain is the same that it always is with Paul.  He needs someone to tell him what works and what doesn't work because he can't be objective.  On Tug of War and Flaming Pie he had George Martin and Jeff Lynne respectively to tell him that he needed to produce better songs.  One would think that David Kahne would be able to do the same here but there are too many soft spots to make it true.<br />However, there is some effective material here that shows Paul can still do it.  The old lyrics debate aside, From A Lover To A Friend, Driving Rain, Spinning On An Axis, About You, and Riding Into Jaipur are my personal favorites, but there are also two or three tracks where the avid Paul fan will shake their head and think &quot;not again&quot;.  I'll always wonder why he can kick ass on stuff like his original songs on Run Devil Run, but falls back into old habits time after time.<br />Four stars because it does grow on you after a few listens, but don't believe the hype about it being his best album in years.  It's good, but he's done better.
B000006U44|4.0|Imagine that Alice Cooper, David Bowie, Stevie Nicks, and Patti Smith pooled their musical genes and gave rise to a single unique musical artist.  What would that artist be like?  Well, if the artist happened to be a young English-Irish woman, it might be Kate Bush: a superior musician, a remarkable vocalist, a talented writer, a theatrical visionary, and a truly unique--often to the point of the bizarrely weird--performer.<br />During the recording of her first three albums, Kate Bush--a protege of Pink Floyd--seemed primarily preoccupied with extending her vocal range, which is quite astonishing, and then twisting what would normally be considered an elegant soprano into a cat-like sound that bespeaks of angels, devils, faires, witches, lovers, and killers all rolled into one.  The result is often gothic in tone, darkly flavored, and extremely strange, with the delicacy of her voice playing sharply against the intensity of her material.  Some loved her; some hated hated her; but none were ever indifferent to her.<br />THE KICK INSIDE is her debut album, and the first of three recordings on which she would increasingly refine a unique vocal style that might best be described as at once delicately haunting and intensely theatrical.  Her voice was indeed a remarkable instrument, and some of her best songs here--such as the justly famous &quot;Wuthering Heights&quot;--achieve their effect by the combination of little-girlish soprano tones that suddenly descend into a fierce and passionate alto.  Also notable are the album's warmer, more sensuous tracks, particularly &quot;The Man With The Child In His Eyes.&quot;  But there is a lighter side to her work as well, purely playful music that fuses her extraordinary voice with unexpected rhythms and styles, such as the pure-fun &quot;Kite&quot; and the intelligentsia-inclined &quot;Them Heavy People.&quot;  Regardless of the particular track, however, the cumulative impact of THE KICK INSIDE is remarkable, and once heard Kate Bush is never quite forgotten.ate Bush is never quite forgotten.
B00004RFFS|4.0|It was really choppy to me..there were a few simple things that they could've added into the movie that wouldn't have made it to much longer, it's a great movie, I'm not saying it isn't.

B000002MG1|5.0|Easily one of the best albums of the 1990s, R.E.M.'s AUTOMATIC FOR THE PEOPLE becomes one of the cornerstones of modern music in the last decade.  Few albums can touch this in terms of lyrical responsibility, well-crafted music, and top-rate song writing.  AUTOMATIC FOR THE PEOPLE also takes a very big risk which pays off wonderfully.  At the height of the grunge movement, R.E.M. releases a largely calm album.  There is quite a bit of contrast between this and NEVERMIND or TEN.  In the end, however, AUTOMATIC is more rewarding on the emotional level for the listener in the long run that either one of those albums.  And on a sonic level, it's a radical left-of-the-mainstream album which not only became huge but, without a doubt, forever secured R.E.M. a place in music history.  Not only was it in complete opposition to the music scne of the time, it also is, along with Radiohead's OK COMPUTER, the two top albums on the 1990s.  <br />To give a personal listening history, my brother, big into grunge at the time, had bought this album when it first came out and really didn't think much of it.  So I always took it out of his CD-case and listened to it on my own.  To this day our musical tastes are pretty far divided, although we do have mutual ground.  Why this didn't capture him as it did me, I still have not understood why.  He was to busy listening to TEN, I suppose, to really get the gest of this album.<br />Anyway, point being, I've listened to this album since 1993, and track for track I am very hard pressed to come up with a 1990s album even half this good.  This is also an album, even after having listened to it for years, which I never tire of, and I've literally listened to it so many times I've lost count.  While I'm not real familiar with R.E.M.'s body of work, as I understand it this is their best album, and from what I have listened too I can understand that.  The albums I have heard (MONSTER, GREEN, DOCUMENT, and OUT OF TIME) have some great songs, but they're nowhere near as consistent as they are here.  The melodies and arrangements are inventive and well-suited to the music.<br />The atmosphere is probably what is best about the album.  This album is a collection of music dealing with several interrelated themes.  There is a sense of struggle on this album, and a very real sense of hope that we can indeed make this a better world.  While some albums revel in despair, this never sinks to preachy or self-pitying.  You will find few releases where the emotional resonance is as strong as it is here.  I would even almost except the fact that emotionally this has more of an impact than even Dylan's BLOOD ON THE TRACKS lp.  That captures pain, etc, but it is not emotionally as well-rounded as this is.  AUTOMATIC FOR THE PEOPLE captures pain, but also hope, love, a calm soothing effect make it a well-balanced piece.  &quot;Try Not To Breathe&quot;, coming from the prospective of an elderly person, deals with Euthanasia and how he/she has decided to die.  Yet even when he has decided to die the will to live still presses on, and with &quot;Everyone Hurts,&quot; and &quot;Sweetness Follows&quot; in quite close proximity, it is obvious that, while you should understand their request and respect them as humans, euthanasia is not the answer.  Help them, do not kill them.  After all, everybody hurts.<br />As for tracks that are &quot;weak&quot;, there are two.  &quot;New Orleans Instrumental&quot;, which is fine in it's own right, was never my favorite although it fits the mood of the album.  &quot;Star Me Kitten,&quot; although I like the song both in texture an lyrics, says &quot;f- me kitten&quot; instead of &quot;Star Me Kitten,&quot; so parents be warned.  &quot;Ignoreland&quot; is also a rather perfunctory track.  Even with these considered, AUTOMATIC FOR THE PEOPLE is still easily a masterpiece.<br />In the end, AUTOMATIC FOR THE PEOPLE, alongside Radiohead's OK COMPUTER, are my two top picks of the 1990s music, and bothof these albums join that coveted &quot;essential&quot; list of rock albums.
B00005K9LM|5.0|This album is great. The opening track all the until the end is great. It's not too heavy and it's not too soft either. Just plain awesome. Catchy vocals and guitar hooks will keep you listening to this CD over and over like I do.
B00005QZWI|5.0|I'm glad I trusted my instincts and bought this CD ...and _I'm_ a Shore fan.  I can imagine someone who isn't one ... thinking that Shore is, at worst, a plagiarist.  But I found the music not so much reminiscent of Williams' \\"Phantom Menace,\\" but continuing the distinctive choral style Shore exemplified in his own work, which predates \\"Phantom\\" by at least three or four years, \\"Looking for Richard.\\"  Even though it wasn't a big-budget blockbuster, you can't call yourself a Shore fan without at least having heard that music once or twice.  He did what he's basically done in LOTR: namely, a lot of lush choral passages, heavy brass, dynamic strings, and radical contrasts in volume.  Don't fool yourselves: this is pure Shore.  I also appreciated how his music and Enya's melded very nicely and sensibly, almost as if it were his own music (or Shore's music Enya's own).  If you are a fan of film music, you can't go wrong with this purchase.

B00003CXSP|1.0|This story was terrible.  I guess the movie was OK for what it had to work with, but if you're a Silence of the Lambs fan, you're sure to be disappointed.  I didn't like Julianna Moore as agent Sterling, and I can clearly understand why Jody Foster declined the role.  One shining star was Anthony Hopkins who brought Lector back to life.<br />But plain and simple, don't waste your time.
B00003CXCS|5.0|I don't love this movie because of the music, although it is wonderful. Many would sneer at this film because it has been so overly made fun of since the Sixties, but perhaps such people should take a closer look at the true depth of the story, like I did. After having seen it in my childhood over and over again, I watched it recently after it sat on the shelf for many years. I went in with an open mind and was literally moved to tears by the story. The film's true beauty lies not in the cheesy musical numbers or in Julie Andrews dancing around the Alps, but in the courage and determination of the family to sing about life and freedom in the face of Nazi oppression. The &quot;sound of music&quot; is the sound of freedom and hope. To see the opposing forces at work in this movie is to grasp the essence of The Sound of Music. What a heartbreaking drama. Take away the score and the film still stands as a triumph of moviemaking.
B00003CXTG|4.0|I really liked this movie.  I understand the critism because it was labeled as a &quot;war&quot; movie and it clearly wasn't.  So I see how one could be disappointed.  I just saw it a week ago, much past all the hype.  What I saw was a good movie, not a war movie.  I will continue to watch it and enjoy it.

B00005LOUS|4.0|I actaully liked this and after reading some other reviews, it seems I'm in the minority.  I understand why others don't like it becuase it does stray from the original story.  I watch it as a movie that is based on the original Dr. Suess story but clearly not the same.  If you can separate the two, I think you'll enjoy it more.<br />It is worth checking out.
B00003CXXS|4.0|Everyone knows that \\"Jurassic park I\\" was a classic, and with any sequel to a classic it becomes difficult to match the plot, effects, etc... (the original star wars trilogoy being the exception, and the alien sagas running a close second)... Jurassic park II was great until it got state-side then it went downhill quickly! For my personal enjoyment, this installment was much more pleasing...nothing new really happens, it has some cheap thrills & some laughs and that's about what I expected anyway. This was worth the purchase.  Don't get this before you see the first one!
0345451325|5.0|So far I have read up to Chapter 3 because I just bought it today, but I already love it. I do have the game myself but I like the book for the book. The story as I can see from the other reviews is about the main character from the game, Master Chief, and his life becoming a super soldier. Although I am not the sci-fi military book reader I seem to really enjoy this one. It actually makes me feel like Star Wars, as if the main character is training to be a Jedi or something. If you want to get the game that's great, if not, that is great too. But do not think of this novel as a game novel, think of it as a novel novel, because that is what it is.

Monty Python and the Holy Grail delivers the dream DVD for a quintessential cult classic. But with this DVD the Pythons don't let it go untainted. You can still sense their sinister, humorous presence, and the irony is that's only when you're on the Main Menu. You're already laughing [a lot] and the movie hasn't even started yet!<BR> I'm not even gonna start with praising the movie. I wouldn't be writing this review if I didn't consider this one of the funniest films ever made. Fact of the matter is if you haven't heard of Monty Python (You poor idiot) this is the best film to start you off with. The humor is manic, intelligent, and incredibly unorthodox. Never in your life will you ever encounter anyone or anything else with this brand of humor. This is what you get when you combine five british comedic geniuses and one american animator with some whacked out visions. You get this comedy masterpiece. Also fact of the matter when it comes to a comedy of this caliber, accept no less than the best when DVD's are involved. This DVD has everything even little Lego figures singing and dancing. Even the REAL Holy Grail isn't even half the treasure that this DVD. Please make this a must on your DVD wish list. Rush over to a video store within a sawllow's flight (african or European it doesn't matter) to grab this DVD!!!
0393317552|5.0|Guns, Germs, and Steel is very unlike every history book I had in grade school.  Instead of focusing on particular people and events and dates, the author takes a look at civilization as a whole.  He argues that certain peoples have achieved greatness or modernity in certain places, not due to anything inherent in those people, but rather due to the environment in which they lived; things such as land mass axis orientation and size, native food and laboring animals available for domestication.  According to Diamond, history, as it turned out, is largely a coincidence of certain peoples being in the right place at the right time.

The remixes may be nothing special (bar the fantastic &quot;HIStory Lesson&quot;) but are pleasant enough if you're in an undemanding mood. Don't treat this as a failed MJ album, treat it as a superior add-on to the poor HIStory Past, Present And Future Book 1.
B000059MEK|5.0|This CD is extremely awesome.... you'll be humming the songs in your head for months. It is simply pu 14 tracks of bliss. If you like music of any type, this is the cd for you!
6301658795|5.0|Jazz on a Summer's Day carries you back to that July 4th weekend of 1958. Not only the music, but the entire scene of that era. I've seen it many times and it almost literally takes me back to that time. It is best seen late at night all alone, with no distractions. The crowd,before the show, around the town of Newport, it all combines to bring together a wonderful experience. I'm always sorry when it nears the end.
B000002J09|4.0|This is undoubtedly Led Zep's most popular album, and probably a &quot;must-have&quot; for anyone who appreciates 70s rock and roll. At the same time, this isn't really their best studio effort. It fails to put their versatility on display, nor does it even classify as a groundbreaking effort. For the latter, I would have to choose &quot;Led Zeppelin II,&quot; for the former, &quot;Physical Graffiti&quot; is clearly better. <br />The truly ironic part is that the WORST SONG on this album, &quot;Stairway to Heaven,&quot; somehow became their signature work. The song title provided the theme for our prom, and has found a (seemingly) permanent place at #1 on every FM station's countdown of the top 100 songs of all time. GIMME A BREAK!! S-t-H is no more the magnum opus for Led Zeppelin than &quot;Freebird&quot; is for Lynyrd Skynyrd!! Skip this song, and you've missed out on nothing (but do NOT skip &quot;Going to California&quot; or &quot;When the Levee Breaks&quot;).<br />All told, you should have this CD. But if you're buying your first Led Zeppelin, either of the two studio efforts mentioned above would be a better choice.
B000059HAI|5.0|This is the film that the Disney &quot;Pearl Harbor&quot; should have been. No state of the arts special effects can compare with historical facts, intensity, and spirit of this movie. &quot;Pearl Harbor&quot; is just a shadow of Tora! Tora! Tora!
B00005JKES|3.0|I sat down last night to watch my new DVDs and was just as horrified as everyone else to find that the pilot episode was missing, again. It was missing from the VHS boxed set as well. I had to tape it off of Bravo in order to get a decent copy.<br />But the missing pilot is not the only problem with this set. The cheesy home-movie &quot;documentaries&quot; that are provided as special features are equally disappointing. Although I am grateful to people like Kyle MacLachlan, Sheryl Lee, Catherine Coulson, Richard Beymer, etc for taking the time to give interviews, I think that sitting through an interview with the lady who owned the T-Mar (Double R) diner was a bit much, particularly as the interview included no actual footage of the diner as it appears today, something I might have been interested in seeing. Clearly, the features on this boxed set are put together by fans with limited resources---eg, the guys from Wrapped in Plastic and Twin Peaks Festival organizers---rather than anyone with the power to really do something wonderful, and watching them is not unlike sitting through the Blair Witch Project.<br />All of these negatives, however, are worth suffering through for the privilege of having the episodes on DVD. I've noticed things on these nice, clear DVD images that I hadn't noticed in years of watching the show on TV or VHS. Lynch is a master. I can only hope that he takes enough pride in his work to step up and make a better DVD for the second season, for the movie, and for the pilot. There must be reels of outtakes and behind the scenes goodies. A tour of the locations would be fun. How about an interactive diary? A lot of good things can be added to spice up the package. For the pilot, how about having both endings---the TV version that led into the series, and the European film version that ends with the Bob and Mike sequence?<br />Is it a good buy? If you're a fan, and if you can wait patiently for the pilot, then yes. If you've never seen the series, wait until Bravo runs the series again in full so you can see the pilot and the show itself before you spend the money.ies, wait until Bravo runs the series again in full so you can see the pilot and the show itself before you spend the money.
B00005QZ7U|4.0|The reason to see this movie - asides from the eye-candy aspect - is for the re-interperations of some well-known songs. The two standouts are &quot;Material Girl&quot; and &quot;Roxanne.&quot; They are by no means jazzed-up pop redos, but pieces that have real texture and fit the plot.
B0000524E5|5.0|When I began to see commercials for this film, I couldn't help but question the integrity of its creators. My immediate thoughts were that it was just about a few women dancing on top of a bar in front of guys, which is both insulting to my intelligence and overall just a waste of my time. I laughed at the thought of seeing it until one day when I noticed it was on Digital Cable. I figured I would amuse myself by taking a peak at acting at it's worst...I was wrong. I found myself to actually be enjoying it. I immediately watched it the next time it was on so that I could catch the movie in its entirety and I really enjoyed all aspects of the movie, so when I purchased a DVD Player recently, I knew that this was a \\"must buy\\" for me. The DVD is awesome and I recommend it to everyone who is looking to sit back and enjoy a fun and loveable movie.<br />I would without a doubt give the movie 5 Stars
B00005JKT8|5.0|I didn't expect too much before I entered the theater. However it was just a little too long to sit through the 3 hour Lords of the Ring after Christmas. It was to my surprise that this is not just a light-hearted, less than 3 minute laugh romantic comedy (have you even squeezed a smile during Shallow Hal?). The pace, the casting and the wardrobe of the movie are perfect. The contrast between the 19th century gentleman Hugh Jackman and the 21st century New Yorker Breckin Meyer is extraordinary structured. The jokes are clever and short. The plot, a mix of historical reference and fiction is imaginative (though the jumping off the Brooklyn Bridge part is not convincing at all). This is a typical Meg Ryan role while Hugh Jackman has all the charm and class as the Duke (much better than Swordfish). Breckin Meyer, who plays the little brother is the best of all. He shines through the movie and steals quite some scenes.<BR>Generally speaking, I enjoy it very much and highly recommend it to anyone who is tired of the regular romantic comedy which usually goes nowhere.

B00005JKCF|5.0|A young Peter Parker, while on a feild trip to a science facility, gets bitten by a genetically enhanced super spider, causing him to gain muscles, and better vision. Peter is now able to climb buildings with the greatest of ease, sense danger before it happens, and is able to lift very heavy things. How more amazing can you get? When all of a sudden a guy in green suit who calls himself &quot;The Green Goblin&quot; shows up to to make our favorite wall-crawler's life more hectic than it already is. Will Spidey survive this ordeal? Will people find out his secret identity? Will Mary Jane ever stop screaming? On May 3, 2002 the whole world will know the answers to these questions and more when one of the most anticipated movies of all time hits theater and snags us all in its web of adventure and excitement.<br />Toeby Maguire playing Spider-Man will be awesome. I can't think of anyone else who would be better to play the greatest super-hero of all time. Finally he will be recognized as the great actor that he really is. Can you believe they actually had Freddie Prince Jr. up for the part? Kirsten Dunst IS Mary Jane Watson. The only problem that I have (Just by seeing the previews) is the Green Goblin costume. It looks like  a robot from the Power Rangers TV show. <br />Besides that small problem this movie is gonna rock. Be there on May 3, 2002 and experience the ultimate spin. &quot;Hey there. There goes the Spider-Man.&quot;
B00005B36H|3.0|The problem with Tool's new CD is that, yes, it does flow, and it does flow on multiple levels. It is beautifully mastered into nearly a symphony. The problem is that Tool has lost all of their intensity. Like J.S. Bach, they've lost their driving force in favor of trying to turn out what others want of them. They don't experience the emotions from their hearts any more. This is why some bad reviews are written about how the rockers, etc. are disappointed... Tool used to be in your face, blasting it into your ears, and you felt the emotions they had. They didn't need to try to push them in, or try to do anything with them. The music was intense, and that spoke for them. This CD, while great, was made in a way where somebody said &quot;how do I express this emotion to the listeners.&quot; They tried hard to do it, and the harder you try, the worse you fail.<br />The end line is that it -is- a great CD. It just has one critical fault in it.
B000001TAX|5.0|While I don't know if this album &quot;makes a collection&quot; or what not, it is certainly one of my faves to session with and is also super-strong, musically speaking. Excellent production (by the Congos)and of course the Lee Perry/The Scientist synthesis on mixing are simply sublime. It is a shame the Congos specifically and reggae in general is relegated to such a subsecondary position of interest in the musical world. This music and the amenities that go with it are truly the healing of the nations. <BR>Get this one!!

B00003CXTG|1.0|I have just watched Pearl Harbor on DVD and found it to be the worst example of Hollywood corrupting history I have ever seen. From the 5 minutes actually spent on the attack on the Pacific fleet (second wave ?) to the Doolitle raid (in an a movie about Pearl ?) taking off in a flat calm from an angled deck carrier (not invented by the British until the 50's) this film more than stretched incredulity. If you know anything, and I mean ANYTHING, about WWII avoid this film at all costs. The premise that two fighter pilots (who shot down 7 enemy planes during the Pearl raid according to the film ??) would be asked to become multi-engine bomber pilots is beyond farcical. How the producers managed to get this piece of crap past the top brass is beyond me. The strange thing is that at times the effects were stunning. The SGI shots of the Oklahoma capsizing were amazing. And yet we would still see shots of modern Spruance class cruisers with obvious pyrotechnics on deck purporting to be WWII warships. In short, after much anticipation I was VERY disappointed. If you want to see a film about the attack on Peal Harbor I would recommend Tora Tora Tora. By far the better film. Don't even bother renting this waste of time.
6303823351|5.0|WOW!  This was such a good movie!  The Beatles are so hilarious I can't stop laughing while I watch this movie!  It has a funny story and it is so much fun following the Beatles to beautiful locations to save Ringo's life.  The humour in this film is so like the Beatles, that you might have to watch it a few times before you get all the jokes.  I loved how the Beatles each acted different in their own way.  John, of course, was the sarcastic one, Paul was the charming one, trying to pick up the ladies, Ringo was just good ol' loveable Ringo, and George was fantastic!  He was so funny, but in his deadpan serious way!  They were all hilarious!  And of course the musical segments were awesome since the movie has such an outstanding soundtrack!  This movie has more than it's share of hilarious quotes and is super funny!  I love the Beatles more than anything and I know that if you like them, you will most likely LOVE this movie!!  A MUST SEE!!
0385505833|4.0|Grisham, for the second time, moved away from his usual genre so that he could give us,the real fans, a taste of his mildly wacky side. I had a good time reading Skipping Christmas, realizing after all that this author is not your typical millionaire-snob with a mountain of a chip on his shoulder;he is funny, he cusses like the best of us and is too human to be hated. Thanks for the laughs!
0385505833|5.0|This book was a total surprise to me.  I am a fan of Grisham, but I never knew he could be so funny.  I spent most of this book laughing out loud.  Then the last chapter brought me back to the reality of a &quot;happily ever after&quot; ending.<br />This is a the story of a couple who want to get rid of the baggage of a materialistic world around the holidays.  Their solution is to skip Christmas.  They plan a lavish vacation and inform their friends.  The lengths they go through to avoid the typical Christmas activities are hysterical.  Then their 23 year old daughter calls and tells them she is coming home with her fiance to show him how great Christmas is with her family.  They are thrown into a worldwind of activities to make their daughter happy.<br />Great book, I would recommend it to all who need a lift after a materialistic Christmas.
B00003CX5P|5.0|Star Wars: The Phantom Menace got a DVD package that it deserved. Not only is the film finally transferred perfectly to DVD format (complete with multiple commentary by all the important people involved with the films creation) but also comes with a second disc packed with extras. Theres a great 1 hour documentary, all the teasers and trailers, a hoard of mini documentary's, and picture galleries. Many seemed to have disliked this film, and though their opinions are there own, there is no doubt that this film is now part of the Star Wars mythology, and deservedly so. Lucas creates a beautiful universe and it definately shows on this DVD. Pick this one up and see why not only the film was one of the highest grossing blockbusters of all time, but why it's one of the fastest selling DVD's of all time.
0792839730|4.0|A star studded- perhaps overly star heavy- treatment of one of the great campaigns of WWII, told in a heavy-handed but historically accurate manner. It suffers from the same sort of faults that marred The Longest Day- the dialogue has a tendency  to be overly ponderous, and constantly broadcasts what's to come next. There are few, if any surprises, and that tends to make the pacing of the film seem slow and heavy. So many stars keep popping up that it detracts from the pacing of the film. Look! It's Sir Lawrence, and he's talking to Liv Ulman! I recall when I first saw the film thinking &quot;what's Robert Redford doing out there in the middle of WWII?&quot;<br />And yet, the story and the details of the operation are told accurately- far more so than in A Bridge Too Far- and the scenes of battle and soldiers being wounded are realistic in a manner not typical of the time.<br />What bogs down the movie, and what made it unpopular at the time, I think, was the never ending sense of defeat and hopelessness of the troops at Arnhem that permeates so much of the movie. There's never any question that theres is a lost cause, and that they'll be lucky if any of them make it out alive.<br />This is a movie for the war historian, and not the casual viewer. But for that specific audience it's a valuable addition to the library.
B00003CXAA|4.0|The DVD package for the most part is a gem.<br />The Movies, Godfather I &amp; II need no review, and III is good enough along side the other two.<br />Disk five is full of information and Easter eggs that really should be boring, and yet are done in such a way that even the most trivial piece of information is made interesting and exciting. There's enough there to please and educate any Godfather fan, maybe just leaving you wanting a little bit more.<br />I was disappointed that the deleted scenes weren't incorporated into the full features, but they were at least included, and exciting to see.<br />The big letdown for me was the feature I most eagerly anticipated - Francis Ford Copolla's commentary on top of each movie. I was exasperated by the second hour of the first movie, having heard for the umpteenth time how close he was to being fired, and why, and when, and by who, and on what day and for what reason - did I already say that? <br />Incredible classic scenes are being played, and instead of talking about the scenes, the difficulties, the stories, the actors, the FILM... it was all about him, his low budget and how often he was almost fired. By the third hour I was groaning.<br />Besides this wasted opportunity to really experience scene by scene how this movie was made, I'm glad this DVD came out. It's a welcome addition to my collection of classics.

1577311523|5.0|I highly recommend this book to anyone who is serious about their spiritual and philosophical journey.  I've read many wonderful books on the topic, not least of which is Meditations by Marcus Aurelius, but got the feeling that all the reading I've done prior culminates, in essence, into this one truly significant work.  I had some difficulty comprehending Chapter 6 on the inner body and I look forward to reading it again but the rest of it just blew me away.  Mr. Tolle also provides practical examples which I find extremely helpful when dealing with such profound subject matter.  The basic premise is living in the present moment, becoming consciously evolved and not allowing your mind to continually delude you with past or future thoughts thus stealing the only truth you actually do possess which is the now.  I'm not too good at summarizing so I'll not mislead you, but I will tell you that this work resonated with me in a big way.  It speaks to our higher level of consciousness that most of us are not aware that we have.

And he tries to dis Trent Reznor, please, he was making music before you and he'll be here after the end of your disgraced music carrer. Linkin Park's \\"Hybrid Theory\\" is 100 times better than all 3 of Limped Bizkit's cds. And at least Mike can actually rap without the ghost writers. Fred, I advise you not to rap anymore, because you Can't. No More Bizkit's Please.
0451203933|5.0|I have never read such a heart-stopping, bullet on bone crunching account of warfare.  I am not American but this true-life account makes me proud to think that there are young people like those depicted here, in the Rangers and Delta Forces, who risk their lives everyday to keep democracy alive for the rest of us.<br />Congratulations Mark Bowden for creating a very fitting monument to the courageous spirit of a few.  <br />I will continue to recommend this book to everyone I meet...but let them buy their own copies!
0792151712|3.0|This is a masterpiece of special effects of the sinking of a passenger ship in subfreezing weather.  The love story occupies a great part of the film and is mediocre and has nothing to do with the Titanic.  The well know facts about the sinking are not covered in this film.
B00003CXTG|3.0|Okay,  I have a true love about the history of World War 2 having started to study it almost from when I could first read.  The movie seems to poke a finger at America for not becoming involved in the war sooner, after all America only came in at the end of 1941 for a war that ended in 1945 while Britain was there from 1939.  The film producer's state that they were being fair towards Japan in the movie but a total of 10 minutes in a movie of 3 hours is not long enough.<br />The battle scene is spectacular and this is the part of the movie that really scores a good number of points. However, the love story in the movie just didn't seem to have any relevance to what was supposed to be a historical account and brings it down.  Wallace wrote Braveheart without any significant love story but crams one into Pearl Harbour, which makes it lose points.
B00005JH9W|5.0|I first pulled it off the shelf when I worked at a video store when I was 16. After I viewed this film, it stayed with me ever more. The prejudice issues brought up in a time where people were supposed to remain silent, assured its consequent banning after its release. But the true meaning aside from the horror, was that the 'freaks' had their own code. Bannished from society by their differences, they formed their own society, complete with punishment for the offenders. <BR>I still think that the scene at the table were she stands up in total disgust and screams &quot;FREAKS!&quot; is one of the best movie moments ever recorded.
B000002HH2|5.0|Bjrk is an artist of many talents. The one I admire most is the lyricist.  She is a great singer also, but her lyrics win me over.  This album is probably the best to demonstrate that, since it is my favorite.  The song &quot;Possibly Maybe&quot; is quite appealing with great lyrics (&quot;...since we broke up, I've been using lipstick again, I suck my tongue, in remembrance of you&quot;). The music itself on this album is great and pushes genres from Industrial (Army Of Me...check out the Skunk Anansie's remix...great for metal lovers) to abstract experimental (Headphones) to disco-ish beauty (Isobel) to show tunes (It's Oh So Quiet). This album is a great introduction to the genius called Bjrk Gumundsdttir.  IT'S A MUST!!!
B00003CXTG|5.0|This movie is just...wonderful. The reasons apart from the fact that it is well made, well invisioned by the director, and well performed by the actors...comes from our history, and our present day terror. This tells a young generation about the LAST time we were caught with our pants down. The feeling the viewer gets while watching the film as well as, the special features...is &quot; overpowering &quot;...we NOW can really FEEL the fear.<BR>  My only problem with this package is...when will it be publicly announced that a whole NEW package will be released in <BR>May? And, why do these distrbutors keep releasing the same films, making us buy them over and over again. This NEXT version, will have even MORE Special Features. And I will buy THAT edition TOO! Even sacred ground like this is &quot;useable&quot; to make more money. THIS time...I'll fall for it.<BR>  But will the distributers PLEASE get their acts together. Don't use us like this...release it all the FIRST TIME...
6304712499|1.0|I think my title sums it up. I can't believe that Todd McFarlane (Spawn creator) could have spent so long developing his incredible comic book (the art alone is wroth the cover price!), and then coped out and let this piece of garbage into theaters. I thought the old Captain America movie was awful, but this movie is probably the worst comic to film translation I've EVER seen. How bad it is has become especially apparent in the last few years since the release of Blade (which rocked), and the upcoming Blade 2 and Spiderman movies. The only comic to film transition even close to being this bad in recent memory is X-Men, another complete waste of time and money. If you're into Spawn, buy the animated series, all 3 seasons, on DVD, and be happy.
B00001NFCY|2.0|I recently heard a commentary that Rock and Roll was back and that Creed was leading the resurgance.  Consequently I bought Human Clay based on the buzz and hearing a few cuts on the radio.  I also bought a classic, Springsteen's Born to Run.  Played back to back, I can only say that if Creed is today's Rock and Roll, I'll take the classics like Springsteen any time.  Creed is so dreary and lacking in excitement, I could barely play the whole disk.  I kept hoping for some change in tempo or tone as cut by cut went by.  It didn't happen.  Human Clay's next playing will be in the CD exchange, I should be able to pick up a few classics for it.
B00003CXTF|5.0|Not much more to say. There's a great story behind it. The special effects during the battle sequences was very well done. Everything was believable.<br />Well worth the watch!
B00003CXTG|1.0|I certainly expected a generous amount of slick Hollywood computer animated movie magic when I started this film, but I had no idea that the filmmakers would forsake every single piece of historical evidence that has come to light since 12, December 1941.<BR> <BR>This movie delivers plenty of explosions, death sequences and cheesy love story cliches, but not one single explanation of why these events happened. The historical characters (FDR, Doolittle and Hirohito, etc.) were as shallow as the fictional heroes created to make the story more 'interesting.' <br />I've enjoyed Bruckheimer/Bay movies in the past. Armageddon was a lot of fun, and The Rock was astounding. But to pretend to make a serious film out of one of this country's most devastating days, and to then ignore every shred of factual, historical detail in the process is an utter blasphemy. <br />I beg of you; please DON'T BUY THIS DVD. To do so would only encourage the lousy, shallow and worthless artificial art that these men pass off as filmmaking.<br />If you really want to know what happened at Pearl Harbor (and why), read a book. If instead, you just need something flashy to pass a few otherwise useful hours watching, then this DVD might be for you. Anyone else would be wasting their time. Like I did.
B00003CXXS|3.0|It's an average flick. About what you'd expect after seeing the first two in the series. It's interesting, but nothing special. <br />Special effects and sound are great. Story leaves a little to be desired. Too predictable.
B00000GBHA|5.0|As highlighted by some of the other reviewers, we grew up in SA listening to Rodriguez. Rodriguez was part of any self respecting surfers vinyl/tape and later CD collection.

0060934913|4.0|BAM!!!! A great read, somewhat chaotic, the pacing suffers at times probably the fault of the editor not the author. The reference on the jacket to Hunter S. Thompson sucked me in. The author didn'tlet me down. Lots of drug use and name dropping. Mr. Tony is a real survivor. At times the stories seemed to blur into each other, such as author gets a job calls his friends to work with him does lots of drugs, drinks to much quits or gets fired, variations of this happen repeatedly. I was disappointed that he didn't offer up some sexcapeds but since he's a married man he must have taken taken the PC route and either the drugs created some form of impotence or he's protecting the reputation of NYC's waitresses which I doubt or he doesn't wish to split his next advance with a divorce lawyer. Definatly not a kiss and tell expose. Also I would hope Tony changed the names to protect his friends and/or exemployers if not he should probably watch where he eats. I do find it very ironic that after all the abuse Tony heaps on his peers such as emeril ect.. that now he's going to have his own show on the food channel. But hey theirs alot worse [stuff] you could be reading.
B00005O5JV|4.0|Girl meets Boy.  Girl falls in love with Boy.  Boy dumps girl to go to Harvard Law School.  Girl follows Boy to Harvard Law School to try and change his mind.  In a nutshell, that's the plot of Legally Blonde.  It may sound lame, but somehow it works and turns out to be a fun movie.  Reese Witherspoon is the poor, unfortunate girl with the beautiful blonde hair and the perfect figure.  No one takes her seriously, so she has the &quot;valley girl&quot; role down pat, but during the course of the movie, she finds out she's not so dumb after all.  Never falling out of character, Witherspoon advances from airhead to legal brain and is highly entertaining in the process.  Good for a laugh and a light evening's viewing!
B00003CX8J|4.0|This picture will be much appreciated by the fans of the X-Men comic books. In the past my wife read these comics and so i knew going in a little about the charecters. However someone not familiar with the books may have a bit of trouble with the charecters. All in all a fun movie and i feel the best of the comic adaptations. The picture quality was great and there is lots of action so as long as one doesnt expect a mind excersise it should be an enjoyable movie for most.
B00005QZ7U|1.0|This is one of the most unwatchable messes ever to be captured on film. From the manic pacing, the endless close-ups, the childish storyline and singing of the same Elton John song (&quot;Your Song&quot;) a gazillion times, this disaster is nothing more than a 2 hour MTV video. <br />Rodgers &amp; Hammerstein must be rolling in their graves.
0805066691|5.0|As I read this book, I found myself wondering time and again how the United States government could have been so irresponsible, how the Native American Indians survived to walk among us today, and how these wrongs could be righted. Of course, I found no answers, only more questions, but this book put a spotlight on the problems Native Americans have faced for hundreds of years.<br />This book is written from the perspective of the Native American, many times in their own words. It is disheartening to realize that some of my ancestors treated others of my ancestors with such hatred and scorn. I don't believe that all whites were like the ones discussed in this book, but I do believe that many of them were, and that knowledge is discouraging.<br />What I learned from this book, or rather, what this book reiterated to me, is that we should all accept others for who they are; we should embrace diversity; we should love our neighbors. Even though we may not always see eye to eye, this book showed me that we have to find ways to peacefully co-exist. The African-Americans were not the only ethnic group to suffer at the hands of whites; there were many more who deserve recognition as well.<br />I will warn you that this book is heart-wrenching and if you are looking for something that will make you feel good about the way the Native Americans were treated by the government in the 19th century, this isn't for you.
B00005QDW1|1.0|1st - All of the songs are incredibly boring. Nothing imaginative, nothing new, sounds like more was contributed by the procuders than the musicians themselves.  The area they attempt to break ground in, dance techno isn't a bad thing, this is just a pitiful attempt at it.  A Britney Spears fan will fall in love with this disc.<br />2nd - This is nothing close to No Doubt's previous music.  Hey music groups need to explore new areas, but shouldn't there be something to identify who released the CD?  Rock Steady is to No Doubt, what Slang was to Def Leppard.<br />3rd - I can not believe anyone who has listened to this CD is impressed by it.  Like the popularity of Boy George in the 80's, why someone could actually write a glowing review of this cd is beyond the limits of my understanding.<br />4th - A few suggestions.  1st do not buy it, 2nd ...too late??? well do not re-sell it, why make others suffer??, 3rd - Don't listen to it in your vehicle, you'll be very tempted to see how far it can fly out of your window, and this may cause an accident.<br />Well, if you must have it, WAIT!!, I'm sure you'll find it at many garage sales, fleas markets, swap meets, etc in the under a $1 bin.
0671027344|5.0|This book is a pure work of brilliance. I am a 15 year old boy, I could deffinetely relate to the main character (Charlie.) If you have read the great novels \\"Catcher In the Rye,\\" or \\"A Separate Peace,\\" and enjoyed those, I guarantee you will have a splendid time reading this gem. ...I couldn't stop reading this book. I read it all in one day (with breaks of course.) I think anyone can relate to the delicate nature of the topics this book deals with: \\"death, suicide, sex, drugs, experimentation, ect.\\" You'll never look at mix tapes the same again.<BR>Also, throughout the book Charlie reads many great novels that I would highly recommend like \\"Naked Lunch,\\" \\"On the Road,\\" \\"To Kill A Mockingbird,\\" ect.
B00004ZB9D|1.0|never really liked the guy's music...are you gonna go my way is decent. he's never done anything original or worth mentioning, just like most of the &quot;artists&quot; in music business.

B00005U2LM|2.0|Oh God! Another Wu-tang album? Didn't they release an album earlier this year? To everyone out there, the Wu dynasty is over. There will never be another album like their 36th Chambers debut. If you crave originality that the Wu has lost, then check out Ghostface Killah's Bulletproof Wallets. He is the only real emcee worth checking out. This album is only an improvement over the last one but is still below previous efforts' standards.
6303402348|5.0|I lived through all this - the music, the historical events, etc. Forest is like my guardian angel taking me on a tour through my past as viewed from Heaven.<br />One of the best ever movies. It is transcendant, it offers hope, and it shows how big God's heart really is. I've cried my way through it and laughed my way through for years - maybe 6 viewings. One girl friend thought it was &quot;exaggerated&quot;. Uh, huh. I don't see her anymore. Know what I mean?<br />Hey, I bought the sound track and listen to it when I exercise. Oh, yeah!
B00005R2M3|5.0|As a fan of Shakira's, I was impressed by her ability to write and sing in English despite no previous experience.  Though die-hard fans will insist that her music sounds more sincere in Spanish, and I agree, the album contains excellent songs in both English and Spanish.  Being haled as the &quot;next Madonna,&quot; I think Shakira is someone to watch for in the near future as Americans are finding out what the Hispanic world has known for a few years - Shakira is a talented singer!
B00003CXSP|1.0|I thought this movie was Stupid.<BR>And then I felt Stupid for Watching it through to the end.<br />If you want to see a good movie...Watch: \\"Silence of the Lambs\\".<BR>DO NOT WATCH THIS RIDICULOUS SEQUEL...!
B00003CXCQ|5.0|This is one of the greatest movies ever made. My 3 1/2 year old loves this movie. When we got the DVD we didn't have a DVD player, but we knew someone that did. And we watched it over there. There is also a DVD with the movie that allows you to play a game. My daughter is to young to work the remote, but she knew all the answers. It is fun to sit and play a game like that with any child. Enjoy!
B000001EL3|5.0|Like many of my friends, Destroyer was THE album that introduced us all to KISS. To this day, if you ask most fans in their mid-30's as to which album was the best - Destroyer is always in the top two or three. Twenty five years later there is still something compelling yet straight forward about the crisp clean rock sound of this album. Loved it then - still love it now!
0848801571|5.0|Is \\"Childhood's End\\" Clarke's \\"Brick in the Wall\\"? I think it is!                                   <BR>              Just imagine  waking up to the news that huge flying saucers have positioned<BR>           themselves above every major city in the world. Later that day, you and your astonished<BR>          friends and family shudder to discover that every radio and television station in the world<BR>         has been co-opted by the aliens in the spacecrafts and the following message is repeated<BR>         over and over in all the worlds languages. \\"We are not here to harm you, we are friendly, <BR>we want to help you, protect you and guide you. We will not allow you to destroy yourselves.<BR>          Warfare will no longer be allowed.\\" The message goes on, but that's the gist of how Arthur<BR>          C. Clarke in his book \\"Childhood's End\\" envisioned how contact would begin between the<BR>                                         aliens and earth. <br />              Clarke goes on to tell how the aliens use their powers to stop warfare; how they<BR>            communicated to the earth through one man, the head of the United Nations; how the<BR>             friendly space men took upon themselves the re-education of the planet through the<BR>           co-opted radio and television frequencies. The aliens revealed. how they had helped to<BR>         engineer the evolutionary development of the race, and how throughout our history they <BR>had  worked through chosen vessels like Moses, Gautama, Confucius, Baha lai, Jesus,<BR>             Mohamed and many others to try and steer the human race down paths of survival.<BR>             Unfortunately, according to the aliens, all these enlightened teachers soon had their<BR>         teachings corrupted and turned into religion. That's why they, our space brothers, were <BR>here;  to correct our misunderstanding and to help us in our evolutionary development.<br />         Clark's writes that the aliens had revealedthemselves in order to help the human race take<BR>            the next big step in it's evolutionary progress. This next stage, as Clarke imagined it,<BR>           involved the youth of the world metamorphosing into a universal mind and floating off the<BR>         planet like a butterfly into another dimension. This coincided with the end of the ability of <BR>the  race to procreate itself --the adults were left behind to grow old and just die off, thus the title<BR>          of the book: \\"Childhood's End\\" Clarke, like many today, really believe that the human race<BR>         is headed for a great evolutionary leap and that it could actually occur along the lines that <BR>he   fictionalized in his book. Clarke wrote, that after the initial coming in their flying saucers, that<BR>         it took decades before the aliens could actually reveal themselves personally to the people<BR>         of earth. They first had to re-educate the planet and especially de-mystify the <BR>devil--because  the funny thing was, that when the friendly space brothers finally did reveal <BR>themselves to the earth they looked like the spittin' image of the devil himself, or at least, how the <BR>old Christian  artists had painted the devil--with horns, cloven feet, and a tail! <br />          Now Clarke envisioned it taking decades of re-education by the aliens in order to get the<BR>         people to the point where the aliens could reveal themselves without freaking everybody <BR>out    of their minds. However, Clarke wrote this back in the 50's, and didn't anticipate the <BR>stupendous progress made in public education and the media towards demystifying  religion and <BR>softening the minds of the masses to accept a demonic intrusion of Earth as a   \\"Close Encounter <BR>Of The Third Kind\\".Today the entire western world is in a post-Christian  era . It does have a <BR>Christian veneer, but underlying that is the new western paradigm of evolution with it's befuddled <BR>logic and amind-set that is wide open to receive the great  evolutionary deception of our friendly <BR>space brothers. They are ready to receive the the Devil himself! \\"And Satan was cast out into the <BR>Earth, and his angels were cast out with him\\"    Revelation 12:9 ......
630575067X|5.0|I generally find sci-fi very hard to follow, but this one was very easy to understand (with occassional explanations from my husband), and Jar-Jar Binks made it very entertaining, regardless of my ability to follow the plot.
0451203933|3.0|I read this book because usually books are better than movies, and I had intentions of seeing the movie.  I wonder if this is a case where the movie might be better?  The book seems well researched, but I found it very confusing.  My assumption is that confusion reading reflected confusion on the ground in Somalia.  In that sense, the book probably reflects well what happened.  But, I simply could not follow the interspersed stories as they were told to the author by the soldiers involved.  I wanted to understand from the maps where the individuals were, but I simply could not orient myself adequately.  My guess is that the movie will also reflect this confusion and that it might be difficult to follow the story line other than the sheer confusing bedlam of the real event.
B00005OAJ1|5.0|...but Tenacious D really is pretty special, and might even deserve that comparison.  What might seem on the surface to be a simple lowbrow hard-rock parody, displays a canny knowledge of the cliched catchwords of &quot;rawk&quot; writers (in &quot;Tribute&quot;) and tastefully understated music that will insinuate itself into your ears and then eat your brain.  Enjoy!
0064431789|4.0|Where the wild things are is a good example of a chidren's book that most people would want their children to read. It is great for their imaginations: Forests growing in rooms, monsters becoming friends with a child, it can make them think past reality. It also has lots of colorful and creative illustrations<BR>for even more imagination. The one thing this book lacks is a moral. Not that all children's books should have morals, but for a famous book like this, it would have made it better.
B00005QIPH|1.0|I bought this on the strength of moist rock-writer reviews - why do I continue to remake this mistake ('cuz every now and then, the idjits are accidentally correct!)?  This time, disappointment.<br />Derivative.  Sounds like a hundred other nineties/aughties bands who are *oh* so disaffected.  Maybe it's just me getting old, but I don't find anything remotely original anymore in twenty-something unhappiness.  Tell me something good, or if it's bad, then don't be wishy-washy- *own* it; *mean* it!  I can hear this stuff at any shopping-mall penny fountain in america an hour after school's out.<br />I further suspect the &quot;creative forces&quot; in the group were all too ready to compromise in the studio in order to be the next STP - &quot;allright, which of you wants to be the addict?&quot;
B00005QZ7U|5.0|Well....Moulin Rouge is by far the best movie I have seen in ages. It is filled with action, humor, music, and most of all romance. The first time I saw it I was a little bit confused about what was happening, but the second time blew me away. Nicole Kidman's singing, dancing, acting, and overall preformance was outstanding. Her part really showed all of her talents. All of the preformers played their parts in an outstaning way also. I think the story, the choice of characters, and vocals really completed the film. The day after I saw the movie, I bought the soundtrack, and it had been in my cd player since. The people who did NOT enjoy the movie obviously have no true taste in what is good and what isn't. Well if you haven't seen it yet, I encourage you to, because you are missing out on a masterpiece!
B000002IOW|4.0|The first time I heard this(on cassette,it would still be a few years before I moved up to CD)I was amazed at what I heard. For starters, I heard a guitar. And Mr. Lifeson was actually playing guitar parts, not those horrible \\"pastel\\" style keyboard chords he had been playing for 7 years. There were strong melodies, something they had started doing again, but not consistently. This album was very much a return to form. I don't think that it was a coincidence that it was also their first recording for a new label(Atlantic). They clearly had something to prove, and they did.<BR> The only reason I did not give this 5 stars is Geddy's bass. Don't get me wrong, his playing is nothing short of incredible. I would expect nothing less from him. It's just that the recording of the bass is a bit weak. There is no bottom end, and it is very low in the mix. \\"Roll the Bones\\" had the same problem. However, that problem has been fixed, and then some on their later albums \\"Counterparts\\", and \\"Test for Echo\\".<BR> All in all, this is a very enjoyable CD. It is not their best. That would be \\"A Farewell to Kings\\", but it is FAR from their worst. That would be \\"Grace Under Pressure\\". I would reccomend \\"Presto\\" to any fan of real music, played by real musicians. Enjoy.
B000002TYK|5.0|For anyone who thought Dave Grohl was &quot;just the drummer&quot; for Nirvana, think again. He's an amazing talent; he not only wrote all the songs on this record, he played every instrument and sang on all tracks. This album was originally released without his name on it, so that it could stand on its own without the word &quot;Nirvana&quot; being mentioned. It begins with &quot;This is a Call&quot;, and while Grohl himself has dismissed the lyrics as &quot;stupid&quot;, you can't deny the power and drive of the melody. &quot;I'll Stick Around&quot; is a hard-rocking anthem of breaking free from a relationship, be it professional or personal. &quot;Big Me&quot; (known as the &quot;Mentos&quot; video) is probably the best-known song on the record, an ironic love song. Every track on the album showcases Grohl's knack for strong lyrics and impossible-to-forget melodies.<br />This self-titled record was followed by &quot;The Colour and the Shape&quot;, which includes the excellent &quot;Monkey Wrench&quot;, &quot;My Hero&quot;, and &quot;Hey, Johnny Park&quot;, as well as their best-known song, &quot;Everlong&quot;. It's a perfect record from start to finish.<br />In 1999, the Foos released &quot;There is Nothing Left to Lose&quot;, which won two Grammys. The victory was made sweeter thanks to the fact that the whole album was recorded in Grohl's basement studio in Virginia. Hits off this one include &quot;Learn to Fly&quot;, &quot;Breakout&quot;, and &quot;Next Year&quot;.<br />Recently, Dave Grohl worked with Tenacious D on their debut record, as well as the latest release from Queens of the Stone Age. He's also at work on a side project called PROBOT, which will reflect his love for heavy metal. Grohl plays drums on all the tracks (true Foo fans are frothing at the mouth to hear our beloved Dave back on the drums!) and has a guest appearance from Lemmy from Motorhead, among other heavy metal gods.<br />Now the Foo Fighters have become the best band America has to offer the world. The lineup is Dave, Nate Mendel, Taylor Hawkins, and Chris Shiflett. They are tighter than ever, and are currently recording a new album, due this spring. I strongly urge anyone who's into rock music to pick up all three of the Foo Fighters' albums. You'll see why they're David Letterman's favorite band!<br />ps, have I mentioned how much I LOVE Dave Grohl?
0385505833|5.0|I truly enjoyed this book, I read it in two days!  Didn't want to put it down and then couldn't wait to pick it back up.  I laughed out loud through out the book as I pictured the characters in the predicaments they created.  How many of us would like to skip Christmas sometimes but would never have the courage.  It was such a fun read and left me with a smile on my face which is what I needed during the hectic Christmas season.
0452282152|4.0|&quot;Girl with Pearl Earring&quot; brings life to a portrait.  Tracy Chevalier fills Griet with vitality and energy, making her a sensible and realistic woman.  She is a young woman, not willing to be crushed by tragedy, but unable to stop the fall of those around her.  Chevalier's vivid descriptions of people and places create a world of art and of creation, both that of Vermeer and her own.  <br />Definitely a book worth reading!
B00003CXE7|3.0|I'm very picky when it comes to buying DVDs. Like most people, I prefer instead to rent, and even then I read up beforehand, because I don't like supporting [bad stuff].<br />Gladiator is a megaproduction that you have to watch a few times to really appreciate, with the exception of Ridley Scott's direction. Some criticise it as being too dark, the dialoge stilted and uneventful, or a very jaded representation of Rome, and they're right.<br />As an epic, Gladiator falls far short due to it's narrow-scope and jumbled pace, making for a rough and confusing ride, which leads up to a somber, anti-climactic end that leaves you with the same pervading unease you had throughout the film. Suffice it to say, I didn't really enjoy watching Gladiator at first. Even grand-scale recreations get boring if there is no substance behind them. The performances from Russel Crowe and Joaquin Phoenix drew me in at times. The two DVD set is excellent and packed with a variety of features, and the picture clarity is about the best I've seen.<br />- Louis
B0000508U6|4.0|Parachutes is simply soothing. Perfect study music. There is something profound about the way British/European Rock bands perform their music. Parachutes seemed to be done with great thoughtfullness. Songs like Sparks, Yellow, and the whiney, Trouble all have lyrics that can apply to anyone and their situation(s). The lead singer has a voice that draws you into the music, and the minor-key songs, which make up most of the album, almost bring tears to your eyes, when you listen to them. I believe that Cold Play has staying power. I hope they hold on to their definitive style, by not getting drawn into the pop world.
0140157352|5.0|After using this book to lead a workshop in &quot;Negotiating and<BR>Influencing Skills,&quot; pariticpants reported back to me on their<BR>successes.

Another bought a horse<BR>that had been priced at $10,000 for only $6,000 and left the previous owner delighted with what the sale could include, other than money.

0345350499|5.0|I think this was a awesome veiw of the King Arther legand. The view was told from a woman, which I really loved. The book had such a different spin(in a possitive way). I loved the religion differences, and seeing the characters struggle through different climaxes. Morgan, the main charecter, I could really relate to, and I found myself very involed with this story, infact, I could not put it down. Marion Zimmer Bradley made me feel like I was in the story. I definatly recomend this book to other readers, and it definatly deserves 5 stars.

B00005BJ2O|5.0|I bought this album right when it came out, even before many people had heard Lady Marmalade, because of the Beck songs and the songs by Massive attack, as they are some of my favorite artists/bands.  But after i finally saw the movie, i gained a whole new perception and appreciation for this soundtrack.  The movie is one of the most intriguing, stunningly great musicals i have ever seen, and also one of my personal favorite movies of all time. the song that nicole sings &quot;someday i'll fly away&quot; is my favorite, and is stunningly goregous.  This album has kind of been a fluke for the mainstream.  The album is for artsy people usually into indie movies (like i am) and musicals. This movie and soundtrack is not mainstream.  Lady Marmalade has misguided the whole maistream.  We got on the topic of this last night, and one of my friends says &quot;Dude, if that movie is anything like that video, im seeing it!&quot; It shows how miseducated mainstream america is about this movie, but without that song, the movie would have made about 1/5 of what it has made now.  And it is one of the top 35 grossing movies of 2001.  If youve seen the movie, you probably already own the soundtrack, or you are dying to get it.  Definately buy it if you dont have it.
B00005R23X|5.0|Francis Ford Coppola's unique and exquisite retelling of Stoker's classic vampire tale.  Coppola chooses to balance out the horrific and supernatural aspects of the story with equal emphasis on history, romance, and overt eroticism.  He masterfully embellishes the film with lavish sets, bold art direction, and stylish camera effects, all choreographed to some haunting musical themes and sounds.  What emerges on-screen is a visually sumptuous, lushly photographed, richly scored cinematic tour-de-force which deservedly won the 1992 Oscars for Best Costumes, Make-Up, and Sound Effects Editing.<br />The cast is first-rate throughout.  Gary Oldman completely inhabits the title character and makes it his own; although Bela Lugosi's singular interpretation of the Count is a definitive classic, Lugosi would be as inappropriately cast in Coppola's film as Oldman would be in Tod Browning's 1931 version.  In reciting several of Lugosi's most celebrated lines (&quot;I never drink ... wine&quot;, &quot;I bid you welcome&quot;, and &quot;Children of the night! What sweet music they make.&quot;), Oldman manages to subtly pay tribute to Lugosi's original readings without ever lapsing into parody or imitation.  Anthony Hopkins is wonderfully over-the-top as the brilliant but obsessive Professor Van Helsing, and Winona Ryder is a clever balance of Victorian ladyhood and sensual romantic as Mina.  Notable performances are also turned in by Sadie Frost as the unfortunate Lucy, Cary Elwes as Lucy's betrothed, and the always interesting Bill(y) Campbell as the Texan who carries a big Bowie knife.  Even the sometimes under-dynamic Keanu Reeves is utilized here to good effect; his dull earnestness is perfect for the role of Ryder's blandly noble intended, Jonathan Harker.<br />The Superbit edition DVD is definitely the one to own, offering impeccable visuals and flawless sound.  It especially looks good on a large-screen TV viewed in wide-zoom mode.  Like the previous DVD edition, the Superbit package comes with no extras, but if you're looking for high-quality picture and sound, you'll not be disappointed.  This is definitely one DVD you'll want to add to your home video library and enjoy again and again.rbit package comes with no extras, but if you're looking for high-quality picture and sound, you'll not be disappointed.

B000001FI7|5.0|I am a big trip hop fan, and fans of both Portishead and Morcheeba. Why compare? Just because they are both popular artists of a little-known to the mainstream genre, it doesnt mean we need to compare them. Dummy by Portishead is one of the best and most enjoyable yet dreary records ever in my opinion. Their stylings are so different though. Morcheeba in this case lives up to the title of the album, &quot;Big Calm&quot; on this album. Its relaxing, euphoric, poppy, and dreamy. It is alot more mainstream and pop, and sounds alot more polished than that of Dummy. Dummy sticks to the original formula of trip hop, experimenting with lots of synthesizers and other instruments while this one experiments alot of other things as well. Although both are very relaxing and downtempo, and both can be used to relax to, Dummy is a little more dreary and sad, and this one is more happy and hopeful. They both have their share of great beats (on Dummy, best example is track 3- STRANGERS) and on Big Calm, some of the most upbeat songs come on tracks 4-6. After a quiet beginning, you hardly even notice it, but the beats get alot heavier and funkier. But why compare these two trip hop artists? They are 2 of the best trip hop bands, and they both have their different styles. While Portishead may have a little more depth to their music, Morcheeba sounds like they put alot more layers and trinkets into their music to make it interesting. I highly reccomend both albums to any electronic fan. Hope this helped!

B00000BKDY|5.0|I've been a Maiden fan since I was 12. My first Maiden album was \\"Killers\\". I loved P. Di'anno, and the music Maiden produced before B. Dickinson joined Maiden.....<br />I loved Number Of The Beast, Piece Of Mind, and Powerslave. I was very excited when Somewhere In Time was released, however it wasn't what I expected.... <br />It was much more than anything I could have ever wished for!<br />This is pure genius. It's without a doubt one of the best Iron Maiden has ever released. Some would say it's too slow, or too fast, or maybe even too progressive....<br />I'll tell you one thing, it's too good to be true. This was an area Iron Maiden had never dared to tread before, and not many Heavy Metal bands ever do. Iron Maiden made a change. It was a change not many of us Maiden loyalists were comfortable with at first, but later realized the true perfection this really is, and holds in the Iron Maiden halls of history....<br />Every single time I listen to this, it takes me back in time. This release is full of all of the great things Iron Maiden stands for.<br />My All-Time favorite Maiden releases are as such....<br />1.) Number Of The Beast - This was over the top in 1982. Contains the classics \\"Children Of The Damned\\", \\"Prisoner\\", \\"22 Acacia Avenue\\", \\"Run To The Hills\\", and \\"Hallowed Be Thy Name\\". The most explosive Iron Maiden effort in my opinion....<br />2.) Piece Of Mind - After this was released, Iron Maiden had finally reached the status of Heavy Metal Gods. This contains the classics \\"Where Eagles Dare\\", \\"Revelations\\", \\"Still Life\\", \\"Flight Of Icarus\\", \\"Die With Your Boots On\\", \\"The Trooper\\", and my personal favorite \\"To Tame A Land\\". Clearly a classic release in Metal History.<br />3.) Powerslave - This was a monster release. Along with Number Of The Beast, and Piece Of Mind, this became the best three Heavy Metal albums you could listen too in 1985. One after another, Maiden never disappointed. Contains classics \\"Aces High\\", \\"2 Minutes To Midnight\\", \\"Powerslave\\", \\"Flash Of The Blade\\", and \\"Rime Of The Ancient Mariner\\". Simply incredible!<br />4.) Somewhere In Time - Very different, but at the same time, a very good fresh breath of air. This release blew me away. It had a totally different sound than previous releases, but at the same time, still contained that true Maidenistic power and melody I always loved. When you listen to this, you almost feel like you've been passed through a time warp.....\\"Somewhere In Time\\" could not have been a better title for this one. Contains classics \\"Somewhere In Time\\", \\"Sea Of Madness\\", \\"Stranger In A Strange Land\\", \\"Deja Vu\\", \\"Loneliness Of The Long Distance Runner\\", \\"Heaven Can Wait\\", and \\"Alexander The Great\\". Calling this a diamond in the rough is an understatment. It's pure genius.<br />5.) Killers/Seventh Son - I love Killers. They never released an album that sounded like this ever again. Almost a spookie feel to it, one that leaves a very lasting impression.....Killers rules!<br />Seventh Son - A really interesting album. Takes over where \\"Somewhere In Time\\" left off....More great classics like \\"Moonchild\\", \\"Infinite Dreams\\", \\"Seventh Son\\" and \\"Can I Play With Madness\\" make this another Maiden diamond in the rough.<br />Over the years, Iron Maiden have remained loyal to their roots, and at the same time, have also expanded their limits by leaps and bounds. <br />If there was ever a manshion inside Heavy Metal Heaven, it would have many halls, among those halls would dwell the greatest Heavy Metal bands of All-Time. <br />On the throne,...Iron Maiden would rule!!<br />UP THE IRONS!
B00003JRCQ|2.0|I was thouroughly dissapointed with this film.  I had very high hopes going into it, especially after reading so many glowing reviews.  Jane Austen is my all-time favorite author and Sense and Sensibility is my all-time favorite film.  As I excitedly opened the box and popped the DVD into my machine I was all a flutter, but as the movie progressed my enthusiasm quickly diminished, and until the terribly wrong ending I still had hopes that it could redeem itself.  <BR>I must admit that the acting was good, but the casting (Anne's father being an exception) was all wrong to me.  It seems like they took a crop of well-known, critically-acclaimed British actors and made them fit into the parts, whether they looked and felt right for them or not.  It may be that I'm used to hollywoody pretty people, so I probably could have excused this point if it weren't for the fact that the score was dissapointing and the adaptation was terribly wrong.  Why is it that screenwriters feel they have to make the characters say and do things that Austen would never have made them say and do in order to relate to present-day audiences?  This was a big problem in the recent Mansfield Park as well.  The screenwriter remained faithful to the book in parts where it caused the film to drag and deviated when a faithful adaptiation would've shone.  The ending was the worst example of this, though I will not elaborate for those who are planning to see it.  <BR>As I said, Sense and Sensibility is my favorite film of all time, and unarguably the perfect Jane Austen adaptation.  If only Emma Thompson would write all of Austen's novels!  Although she didn't copy the novel exactly, one would never know it.  It deviates from the text but still remains faithful to Austen's style and spirit.  Not once do the characters kiss or embrace, but it is still extremely moving and completely romantic, not to mention beautifully directed by Ang Lee.  I highly recommend Sense and Sensibility on DVD if one is lookingfor an Austen fix.  <BR>Persuasion, on the other hand, was very painful for me, especially as it is my favorite of Austen's novels.  It nearly destroyed the novel for me.  I still have to concentrate very hard to picture the characters as I originally envisioned them.  I wish I had never seen it.  It also has made me reluctant to see other film adaptations of her work.  I am itching to watch the BBC/A&amp;E miniseries of Pride and Prejudice, but I am afraid that it will be just as bad, despite all the good reviews I see.  I relied too heavily on the good reviews I read for Persuasion.   <BR>I may be too critical, or maybe just crazy.  So far I am the only one I know who disliked it so much.  Still, I dissuaded my mom seriously from watching this movie and I would caution others to watch at your own risk.  You may think it is wonderful, but I didn't.
6304779607|2.0|Oh man,<br />I'd have to humbly say the only advantage to enjoying this movie is being a twelve year old seeing it for the first time.  But that would be a twelve year old of 1986 actually experiencing it in the movies.  Of which the twelve year olds today would probably need a lot more &quot;eye-candy&quot; to keep them amused.  But boy, is this movie rib-crushingly hilarious to the grown up of right now.<br />Catch me back in '86,'87 as a kid watching this movie with my jaws agape and you'd never believe I'd have grown up to laugh so hard at every TNT &quot;Movies For Guys. . .&quot; showing.  This is such a fun &quot;Dude&quot; movie.  It's so ridiculous and ubelievable - not to mention 80's cheese - you can't help but watch it every time it's on.  <br />But you have to give Sly just a wee bit of credit.  Pulling off that &quot;Ode to Eastwood&quot; thing was probably such a novel idea at the pitch meeting, it truly is a shame we never saw more of the omnipotent, invincible and insatiably charming Marion Cobretti again.<br />Yeah.<br />But anyway. . .so what it's dumb.  So what it lacks the believability of Rambo III.  And so what if you need plot, character development, consistency and story!  This is definitely the movie for you if you think wrestling is real.<br />And two stars?  Hey, man. . .I had to give it something.  One star just wouldn't be fair for the accountability of nostalgia.<br />Godfather?  Definitely not.  But hey, neither was The Toxic Avenger.  And I dare you to find a living soul that's actually seen The Toxic Avenger and not LOVED it!<br />So there it is.  Two stars for the timeless COBRA.  One 'cause it needed one for the review and the other 'cause I was twelve.<br />Take care.
6305907145|2.0|It looked promising when it started. A little done-up, but promising. I was very curious to see how they would pull it off, considering when I read Mansfield Park it seemed to me to be the novel of Austen's least likely to become a movie. Silly me, the thought didn't even occur to me that they would completely change the characters and theme of the book. I could understand why they did what they did, making Fanny trendier and so ahead of her time (many people probably tricked themselves into thinking this was how she was really written originally) and some of the changes would have even worked, such as delicately omitting the fact that Fanny and Edmund are cousins (I can already hear the 'ewww!'s) and making Fanny's sister her distant beloved sibling instead of her brother. But the whole 'slavery is so bad' thing was the cherry on top. Of course it was terrible, but it was so obviously not a major aspect of the book and personally I don't think Fanny would have been terribly bothered by it. The thought of the sketches she found still makes me shake my head and sigh, and don't get me started on Mr. Crawford and Maria in bed...I almost turned it off. I have to go back to what I always say: If only Emma Thompson would write all of Austen's novels! Sense and Sensibility was just a bunch of people in drawing rooms and it was touching, romantic, funny and completely beautiful. It is the only good Austen film I've seen yet that did so well exactly what Austen is famous for doing so well: making one really care about the small problems of a few small people. I guess the makers of Mansfield Park, Persuasion, and so many others just don't get that.
B000002UAX|5.0|I'm kind of a strange Beatles fan, really only being a fan of their last two albums and often for all the wrong reasons.  The strange experimentalism and filleresque goofiness that reoccurs on the white album are often what repel people from calling it their best, yet I love it for those same reasons.  As you can imagine, it was my first Beatles purchase, me being very well aware of such supposed horrors as &quot;Revolution 9&quot;.  Yet this album for me feels like the point where the Beatles really started to go over the top and take off, quite literally.  My own silly interpretation of the planes in &quot;Back in the U.S.S.R&quot; is that of the band &quot;taking off&quot; in order to record perhaps the most creative album of all time.  The first disc is amazing, I even love the more silly, deranged crap like &quot;Wild Honey Pie&quot; and &quot;The Continuing Story of Bungalow Bill&quot;.  Come on people, stop taking these songs so seriously.  They were just cool, little interesting ideas that add to the mystery of the album and make you wonder if the band was sober.  The second disc offers some stiff competition, especially with the ultra-cool Lennon song &quot;Yer Blues&quot; (cool as his songs on the first disc) and the intense madness of &quot;Helter Skelter&quot;, the first song to play to those who thought the Beatles were strictly pop music.  Of course, the album nears it's end with &quot;Revolution 9&quot;, perhaps the most hated Beatles song.  I, being the unique Beatles fan that I am, think it is nothing short of amazing in the moods it creates and the undeniable reactions (good or bad) that it has on the listener.  To me, I see it as a sound collage that is masterful enough to have constant direction and new ideas keep appearing for the full eight minutes.  I think the Beatles wished each to have his own interpretation of it.  To me, it represents the chaos of 1968 by showing chaos in all of its known forms, and then ending with the relation to the one most familar in America at the time, that of the protesters against the Vietnam War.  The album then closes with the lush, beautiful &quot;Good Night&quot;.  How can some Beatles fans hate this song with the touching universal message it ends with, which sounds so genuine and unforced?  To me, &quot;Revolution 9&quot; and &quot;Good Night&quot; really make for one the best album closers of all time and I honestly think the white album would have been complete without them.
B00003CXTG|5.0|Wait! A war movie that has a sub plot outside of the war itself? And THIS is what the majority of you who do not like the movie are complaining about? Pearl Harbor is a movie that can appeal to a large audience without taking away from history itself, and it has a very good reproduction/reenactment of a major event. What is so God awful about that? New Year's Eve 2001 - 2002 saw my wife and me, and our four children, settling down to watch the DVD of Pearl Harbor for the very first time. We were so engulfed in this movie that we missed the countdown to the new year! Well worth the price of purchase, and one that we will watch on December 7th for years to come!<br />God Bless those men who died in the actual event, as this movie brought home the fact that Pearl Harbor is more than just a date on the calendar, just as 'Saving Private Ryan' did for D-Day. And even though the events happened 60 years ago, the heroic acts  of our men in uniform (and the cowardly act of the Japs way back then) are just as pertinent today (especially after September 11) as ever.
B00005RFAI|5.0|Pink may have become a star with her first album because of the pop/r&amp;b mix with her awesome vocals (while telling every man she is not to be messed with).  However, Missundaztood proves she will not be in and out in one album.  As much as I enjoy dance and r&amp;b, Pink has an eclectic array of music that keeps my attention every track.  As personal as this album may be to Pink, every song makes me think of a time when what she sings about pertains to my life.  Each song has its own identity.  It made me think of Prince's album Purple Rain.  Every song is different in lyrics and in sound, which makes me anxious to hear the next track.  Even though I have my favorite songs, I can play this CD all of the way through while singing at the top of my lungs.  Two thumbs up is an understatement.
B00005R2BG|5.0|Everytime I watch this movie I find a new nuance, a subtle meaning carefully orchestrated by genius Baz Luhrman.  Granted, if musicals aren't your thing this movie might fly right over your head.  But for those who love pure artistic beauty and the fantasy we all wish we could find in real life, this is one of the best movies I've ever seen.  The orchestration of familiar songs is unbelievable, and the voices of Ewan McGregor and Nicole Kidman, while obviously not professional, are perfect for the roles.  This movie swings between the hilarious (Spectacular, Spectacular), the starkly dramatic (Roxanne) and the heartbreakingly tragic (What May Come).  You'll come out of it feeling like you've been on a 2 hour roller coaster, but any ensemble of artists who can turn a one dimensional screen into this unbelievable 3-D melange of color, sound, and dance is definitely worth the ride.  The fact the story itself it a bit unrealistic is entirely inconsequential.  Anyone who sits through a movie simply to find more of the reality they live every day is entirely missing the point of entertainment.  Truth, Beauty, Freedom, Love!
B000059GEI|2.0|The problem with trying to describe this movie is coming up with the right adjectives.  Words like flashy, colorful, gaudy and flat keep coming to mind; but the essential fault with \\"There's No Business Like Show Business,\\" directed by Walter Lang, can best be summed up by borrowing a line or two from Ernest L. Thayer's immortal poem, \\"Casey At the Bat,\\" which ends with the lines, \\"But there is no joy in Mudville, Mighty Casey has struck out.\\"  Because, what this movie lacks-- and it's hard to fathom why-- is joy.  Like Casey, it strikes out, big time.  And it's a shame.  It's like having all of the resources to construct the most magnificent building the world has ever seen, including the greatest architects available, and the contractor ends up with a hut a child could've made out of tinker toys.  There's a story here, of course, but it's obvious that the main intention of the project was to showcase the talents of the stars and some very mediocre songs by Irving Berlin, and to dazzle the audience by filling the wide screen with brilliant, colorful images (CinemaScope was the latest, greatest rage at the time, and the studios wanted to make the most of this revolutionary technological advancement).  Someone should have reminded the filmmakers that what they were filling that screen with counted, as well.<br /> The story begins in 1919, whereupon we are introduced to the Vaudeville team of Molly and Terence Donahue (Ethel Merman and Dan Dailey).  The next few years are touched upon briefly as Molly and Terry add three children to their family, as well as their act; the toddlers hit the stage with mom and dad almost as soon as they make their entrance into the world.  The story begins in earnest when the youngest Donahues hit legal age, or there abouts.  \\"The Five Donahues\\" include eldest son, Steve (Johnnie Ray), daughter Katy (Mitzi Gaynor) and the youngest, Tim (Donald O'Connor).  They get bookings and do shows, and eventually cross paths with a wanna-be performer, hat check girl Vicky (Marilyn Monroe) who, after Tim falls hard for her, gets her big break and begins her rise to fame.  The road for all concerned is not smooth, of course, but not to worry-- there's plenty of singing and dancing to go around, and meanwhile Steve surprises everyone with a personal life choice, Tim falls into a jealous funk and Katy meets the handsome Charles Biggs (Hugh O'Brian).  And along the way, Molly and Terry find out what parents have known since the beginning of time:  Raising kids is no picnic.  But at least they have singing and dancing and singing and...<br /> For the first fifteen minutes or so of the film-- or maybe longer; it seems MUCH longer-- we are \\"treated\\" to Molly and Terry's Vaudeville act.  And about five minutes of Merman's singing should be enough for anyone; her voice fairly grates on the senses.  After this extended opening the film moves along, but seems flat and stays that way until Monroe makes her entrance.  Once she's on, the screen belongs to her; but it's still not enough to save the day.  She does, however, contribute the single memorable number to the show, \\"We're Havin' A Heat Wave.\\"  But her \\"Lazy\\" number is just that, and not even the contributions of O'Connor and Gaynor can help it.<br /> The production numbers suffer from poor staging, uninspired choreography and some of the worst costumes you're likely to ever find in a movie.  Even the best song the film has to offer, \\"Alexander's Ragtime Band,\\" (done terrifically by Alice Faye in the movie of that title) is terribly abused here, presented in a lengthy and contrived manner that is beyond repair.  Even \\"Heat Wave\\" was saved only because of Monroe, whose sensuous delivery outweighs the actual blandness of the number.  And the costumes for the grand finale, especially, are embarrassingly ridiculous (and quickly take the \\"grand\\" out of it)-- particularly the white dress Merman wears while delivering the title song; a creation so horrendous it defies description.  Overall, it's a sad commentary on the lack of originality and quality of the film when the likes of Monroe, Gaynor and especially O'Connor can't even save it, even though individually and collectively they do have their moments; the problem is those moments are just too few and far between.<br /> The one believable aspect of the film is the casting of Merman as a Vaudeville star; and after seeing her \\"act,\\" there is no longer any mystery as to what killed Vaudeville.  If this is a sample of the real thing, talking pictures had nothing to do with it's demise.  It simply inevitably imploded.  The burning question that remains is, how in the world did Ethel Merman ever become a star?  And what about Johnnie Ray?  A relatively successful recording artist with a unique style, he was nevertheless dreadfully miscast in this film.  Frequently asked why he made only this one movie, he would reply, \\"Because I was never asked to do another one.\\"  Which is quite understandable; he could sing, but he simply could not act.  And it's hard to discern whether it was just the part or his acting that made his character seem so ludicrous. <br /> The supporting cast includes Richard Eastham (Harris), Frank McHugh (Eddie), Rhys Williams (Father Dineen) and Lee Patrick (Marge).  With a cast including the likes of O'Connor, Monroe and Gaynor, and with songs by Berlin, \\"There's No Business Like Show Business\\" inherently promises great things, but fails to deliver.  There's no getting around the fact that in the end it's a lackluster, forgettable contribution to a genre known for liveliness and joy.  Not the least bit satisfying, it is perhaps the biggest misfire in the history of movie musicals.  And it leaves you with a single, burning question that demands to be asked:  Where's Gene Kelly when you need him?
B000002J0B|4.0|Following the huge success of ZOSO (Led Zeppelin IV), Led Zeppelin had the confidence and reputation to go for a different sound and style. That change is evident on Houses of the Holy, their next release. Although it doesn't quite match up to it's predecessor, HOTH is still a solid release in it's own right.<br />Kicking off the album is the heavy rocker The Song Remains the Same, a frenzied tune you can't help but like. Following is one of Zeppelin's most underrated songs in The Rain Song. Much more laid back than SRTS, Rain Song is very beautiful thanks to some great keyboard accompaniments by John Paul Jones. Next up is the folksy Over the Hills and Far Away, the albums most enduring track radio airplay wise. It showcases Jimmy Page at his acoustic best. After Hills comes the funk inspired The Crunge, which is probably the weakest track of the album, although it features some great drumming by John Bonham. Dancing Days follows, which also recieves a lot of play time on the airwaves. D'yer M'aker, which displays a sense of humor rarely seen in the band with it's catchy lyrics. No Quarter is next, and along with SRTS is the song of the album. Dark, moody, and electrifying, the song works in part once again to some wonderful keyboarding by Jones. Closing out the set is The Ocean, another heavy rocker with a neat a capella section in the middle of the song.<br />Unfairly compared to other Zeppelin releases, HOTH is probably the one album that receives the most divided opinions from fans. Depending on your view, it's a fine, varied release or a huge disappointment considering the album that came before it. Perhaps what's most unfair of all is that it happens to be sandwiched between the band's two best releases, the 22 million selling ZOSO and their epic masterpiece, Physical Graffiti.
B00005B36H|5.0|I really enjoy listening to this album.  Tool are adept at creating emotional, powerful, and challenging music that focuses on a central theme without being repetitive.<br />Maynard's lyrics on Lateralus are openly confessional and direct, and therefore beautiful.  His willingness to share himself through his lyrics puts him in a vulnerable position, and he deserves respect for such selflessness.<br />&quot;Reflection&quot; is a great example of Maynard's ability to communicate something many would be unwilling to share so freely.<br />Close examination of the album reveals a focus on positive messages; tolerance, communication, and selflessness are encouraged throughout.<br />Tool and especially this latest offering are a rare gem in today's musical scene.  They demonstrate that anger and strentgh are not to be confused with hate, and also that thinking for one's self and being a positive force in a turbulent world is what is really important.
B00000ICN5|5.0|Stevie-Ray Vaughan - Texas Flood <BR>The honest, ungimmicky explosion of inspired virtuosity, warm but raw tone and the expressiveness of his playing on this historic album blew me away and changed my musical outlook for ever. The recording was treated as a live gig - he just walked into the studio with his band and played the usual live set straight trough twice - and the spontanaety of the performance shines through. Such raw power is lost when lesser players agonise with take after take. Players like SRV don't need to do that - they can make history in a single spontaneous performance. I feel that the polish of his later records resulted in some loss of this magical spontenaaety.
B00005QDW5|5.0|Usually when you think of Greatest Hits Albums you think of heartless compilations with all the hits and popular songs, with no interesting cult-classic tunes, and no artful reception, a good example of that is The Who's: 20th Century Masters Collection. But there is no way you can call this a greatest hits album, because it doesn't contain all the greatest hits, and it negates what most greatest hits albums are.<br /><br />But what Pink Floyd did for Echoes is something much more amazing, they do for all of these tunes (which are put in no chronological order whatsoever), and give them a Dark Side Of The Moon makeover, with crossfading, additional effects, and what makes it more interesting is that they used the original 1/4\\" master tapes, so they sound so close to the original album.<br /><br />This album contains it all; some mega-hits, early-day Syd Barrett psychedelia, deep cuts, and (though not being a fan of the Post-Waters Floyd) they make the Post-Waters Floyd Cuts sound good with the rest of the music.<br /><br />This album is an artistic treasure, good for any audiophile or any artist. Soak in the good vibes that this album will give to you. Paint a picture, form a band and make some far-out music yourself. The inspiration possibilities are endless, but if you buy this album, even if you're not much of an artsy or musical type of person, you will be inspired to do something artistic. Trust me.
B00003CXZ4|5.0|I saw the DVD 3 times over the course of 2 days and each time I saw it, the richness and sheer genius of execution becomes more and more apparent. This is probably one of the most tightly crafted films I've seen in years. The performances, especially from Pearce are nothing short of astonishing. This is ensemble acting at its absolute best with completely flawless direction and razor-sharp script. This is a desert-island film to keep and view periodically.
B00005Q66T|4.0|I was a little disapointed of the somngs on the CD but besides that I'm no complainer.
B00000IONU|2.0|Okay. So I bought into the hype and bought <BR>the new Strokes and White Stripes albums. <BR>I love the Strokes record to death, but <BR>the White Stripes...they've<BR>got some good tunes, but I was mostly disappointed. <BR>I really wanted to like it after reading<BR>all the glowing reviews, but I just can't<BR>bring myself to embrace it.<br />&quot;I'm Finding it Harder to Be<BR>A Gentleman&quot; is probably the standout track,<BR>and it's got Zeppelin and Exile-era Stones <BR>written all over it. But given the choice,<br />I'd rather listen to <BR>the Stones--they did it better. &quot;Hotel Yorba&quot; <BR>is okay but not spectacular, and &quot;Fell in Love <BR>with a Girl&quot; is catchy and enjoyable<BR>but sounds virtually identical to 1000 other punk-<BR>power-pop tunes that also use the 1, 4, and 5<BR>chords. &quot;I Think I Smell a Rat&quot; is a track<BR>I always skip..I just find it annoying. Sorry.<BR> <BR>As for the drumming being &quot;primitive&quot; and<BR>&quot;minimalistic&quot;--I don't get it. I think its <BR>lack of variety, technique, and interest detracts from <BR>their music...in using a drum only as punctuation <BR>rather than the instrument that it really is.<br />Verdict: it's good, but not great.
B00005RFAI|3.0|The CD was OK. I thought it would be much better than it was. I havn't played the whole CD yet but it certainly isn't the best CD I've heard. I always like enhanced CD's so that's one of the few good things about the CD.
B00004XQ83|3.0|While the music fit well with the movie, it is not easy listening when you are just playing music for enjoyment.  Some of the songs are good to listen to but for the most part I'm not a fan of music that sounds like its from the early part of the 20th century.
B00005QZ7U|1.0|Yuck! This movie is a waste of time and money.  Not even seeing Nicole Kidman in scanty clothes is enough to drag this movie from the slime.  Was it different from the usual formulaic tripe that passes for movie making nowadays? Yes.  But was it good? The answer is a resounding NO!  I would rather watch paint dry or grass grow.  A TV Test pattern has as much interest as this movie.
B00000IMCW|5.0|Dawn of the Dead is THE best zombie movie ever. Every one who thinks the Evil Dead Series is better should be ashamed of them selves. This movie is the best and deserves to be in everyones DVD collection. It's gory, scary, and shows how savage America can really be during a national emergency. Gorege Romero really put out one of THE best zombie movie every and if you don't think so you don't know zombie movies.

0385505833|5.0|This is the perfect book for everyone caught up in too much holiday--shopping, partying and decorating! I finished it over the long New Year's holiday and totally enjoyed its lighthearted, yet serious, look at the way we Americans over-commercialize what's supposed to be a religious holiday. I would love to see it turned into a holiday movie release, especially if they cast the guy who played Newman on Seinfeld as the cop Salino. I'd actually like it if they brought back the Chevy Chase-Beverly D'Angelo team as the Frohmeyer family! Stop being Scrooges and read Grisham's attempt at a lighter, family-oriented fare! And Bah Humbug on anyone who pays full price--I got my copy from the library!
B00005JHAD|5.0|So, the follow up to 'Lock, Stock' and the general consensus seems to be that it's been rubbished by the US. Come on, the Brits don't often make a quality cult film like this! This was a good follow-up and the action flowed a little better with the dialogue being slightly sharper. Vinnie Jones, though having a small role is excellent. Whilst being similar to Big Chris in 'Lock, Stock', the character is a tiny bit softer and funnier. Jason Statham is excellent as the cool-headed Turkish, backed by the funny Tommy. Remarks that audiences couldn't understand the accents so the film failed itself, are unfair. The majority of films on the market are American and we have to deal with the huge range of accents. The director has made a huge effort to keep the accents and settings authentic e.g. Brad Pitt went on location with some gypsies to get his accent right (backed up by Vinnie Jones and Jason Statham). Perhaps what this film does best is to point out that not all Brits sound posh!!! This is a good cult film on this side of the Atlantic and Guy Ritchie is set for big things. Give Brit films a break, we sat through 'Reservoir Dogs' didn't we?!
0399143904|5.0|This book was ther first Tom Clancy book that I read and it was even better than I had expected by word of mouth.  The characters were realistic and also very human, the plot was huge yet simple and the action was fast-paced and shocking.  If you are looking for a good book to read then pick this one.
B00005QZ7U|5.0|I watched this movie only after several people (whose opinions I really respect) recommended it to me, already cringing and ready to tear it to pieces.  &quot;Obi-Wan Kenobi and Tom Cruise's ex-wife in a musical? HA!&quot;  There was something so hokey about the trailers and the whole concept that I had already judged the movie and deemed it a piece of pretentious artsy-fartsy drivel before having ever seen it.  It just seemed ripe for parody. <br />Not only that, but I hate musicals.  HATE THEM!  I've tried to give as many of them a try as I could stomache, but all of the ones I've seen have been terribly cheesy.  It's one of the resons I hate Disney movies.  There's something just basically stupid about them that I've never been able to get past, and to me, Moulin Rouge was going to be just another stupid musical to add to the list.<br />Then I saw it.<br />Ok, now I have to admit how wrong I was.  The music was excellent, the sets were amazing, the story was compelling and it was really funny.  It was that last part that won me over.  It was funny in a very unpretentious kind of way that I found endearing.  It wasn't necessarily self-parody, but the director seemed to know exactly when to add humor to break up the melodrama, and the melodrama was just enough to not seem saccharin.<br />For some reason all the flamboyant corniness ends up being charming instead of revolting.  The flick just has heart.  I was expecting something gaudy like a half-drunk, middle-aged drag queen belting out show tunes and grinding out the rent. Instead it has a sort of childlike innocence that wins you over like a kid whose voice is mediocre but sings with passion and sincerity and never blushes.  <br />For those of you who've already seen it in the theater, the DVD is excellent.  It has lots of bonus goodies like deleted scenes, lots interviews with cast and crew (including one with Fatboy Slim who I had no idea was involved), feature-commentary, music videos and behind the scenes stuff.  The DTS sound is amazing and sounded awesome on my system.<br />Anyway, regardless of what I think, most of you are going to either love it or hate it,  I think you should give yourself the opportunity to do one or the other.  Don't make the same mistake I almost made.  Watch it first, then judge.
B000003TAR|5.0|Nirvana took the best parts of Bleach and Nevermind and combined them into one to make this amazing album.  Every song is a hit, though not exactly the most radio friendly songs:  Just the way I like it.  The lyrics are absolutely brilliant and emotional.  My personaly favorite tracks are 'Heart-Shaped Box', 'Serve the Servants', 'All Apologies', 'Scentless Apprentice'...  Oh hell they're all great.  This is the ultimate Nirvana experience.
B00005R2BG|5.0|I absolutely LOVE this movie! It's a feast for the senses!  I love the singing and acting it's all just superb!  The singing is actually quite outstanding particularly Ewan.  He has a very strong clear voice and it's one of the best things about this movie!  The acting is great. Nicole Kidman at her best.  Ewan is always the best!  This is definately oscar worthy material! And those who it doesn't appeal to...well I can understand that it doesn't appeal to everyone but I absolutely can't understand why! No offense meant.  As a singer myself I can appreciate good voices when I heard them and these two, although not the best, are more than able to get the job done! Terrific flick go out and buy it now! Go!
B00005QDW1|1.0|Call it experimenting, but I call it abandoning the punk code.  No Doubt used to be a really good punk/ska band.  Now they're hip hop.  That is what I'd call selling out.  I can understand other people's sentiments if they don't think No Doubt sold out, but I have my opinion, and I'm firm in my convictions.
B00000K19E|1.0|Am I the only one who wishes those jerks making movies would give us a choice between widescreen or fullscreen versions of these new movies?
B00005BJ2O|5.0|Wow! In the movie, everybody sings in their own voice, they dont lip sync (atleast the two main actor(esses)). The songs on this are very good. I can listen to this CD through and through and still love it. Unlike some of the other CDs out their, with 'filler' songs (by filler I mean unpopular songs you've never heard of before), this one has alot of songs, every one o them is magnificent, to say the least. As for the movie, you either loved or hated it.
B00000AFWW|3.0|I've listened to this CD about a million times trying to figure out if its great or if its garbage.  The truth is probably somewhere in between.  Billy Corgan handles a lot of the songwriting, helping out his old friend Courtney, who was apparently suffering from some serious writers block in the four years it took to make this album.  The weirdest thing about this album is that it doesn't seem to fit in with the other two albums by Hole, both of which are much better.  It seems like she totally skipped an album between this one and Live Through this.  The guitars are so much more shiny, and Melissa Auf De Maur's backing vocals are everywhere, which is offsetting since she was the newest member of Hole when this album was made.  There's so many great things about this album, but at the same time its really flawed and so it can be annoying at the same time.<br />Celebrity Skin is perfect, with Billy's powerful opening riff and the most scathing, self-demeaning lyrics on the album<BR>Awful is really catchy, but its overly poppy and the bridge is sure to annoy, with the lyrics aimed squarely to empathize with teenagers like &quot;oh just shut up you're only 16.&quot;<BR>Hit So Hard is just too shiny, with some of the most empty lyrics Courtney has offered yet.<BR>Malibu was, in my opinion, one of the best singles of 1998, along with Corgan's Perfect.  Best song on the album by far, and if you don't want the album you'd be a fool not to buy it as a single.  Its one of those songs that you can never get sick of; like Perfect its both happy and sad, acoustic and electronic all at once.<BR>Reasons to Be Beautiful is annoying, another pretty bad song with a little message about Kurt at the end.  It has no hook.<BR>Dying is good, but it doesn't really fit on this album.  That's probably the most annoying thing about Celebrity Skin, the songs don't always seem to fit together quite right.  Also, it uses a few sparse techno effects, which is annoying in the context of an otherwise completely guitar album.<BR>Use Once and Destroy is just cool, even if it also doesn't fit the album.<BR>Northern Star was slapped together in 45 minutes, and it could have been awesome if more time was spent on getting the vocal right.  Instead its one big long moanfest.<BR>Boys on the Radio is excellent, the third flawless song on the album.<BR>Heaven Tonight is simply way too poppy and happy.  A bad idea, and another example of Courtney losing her skill for deep and biting lyrics.<BR>Playing Your Song is a grunge throwback, an attempt to be heavy but it doesn't really work unfortunately.  And despite the theme of things being sold out, Love's lyrics just sound weak and generic.<BR>Petals probably best represents this album.  Just short of genius in some ways, but so deeply flawed in spots that it just seems awkward.<br />So many things to say about this album, but check it out even if its short of greatness because its quite interesting to say the least.
0425173755|5.0|'The Murder on the Orient Express' by Agatha Christie is the best mystery, and my second favorite book, next to Harry Potter. The author makes the story start as the 'run of the mill' old Mysteries. &quot;This guy goes_____. Then he recieves a call from _____. Now he needs to go to...&quot; Then the story becomes twisted. Read the book to see the story unfold. This book I would recommend to people 10+ because the language is suited for the early teens and not before. I also like this publication company.
B00005LB9O|5.0|I thought Travis was an &quot;okay&quot; band with &quot;the Man Who&quot; album. Then I heard,&quot;The invisable band&quot;. Wow!!!! Beautiful Lyrics, Wonderful Music and a perfect balance of ambience make this album perfect! The beginnig of 2001 was Limp Bizkit remixes from 2 years ago, one-hit wonder rage rockers like puddle of mud, the played out Blink 182(their popularity is beyond me) and the annoying System of a Down(if you heard &quot;sugar&quot; you heard all their songs)after a day of hearing this, your bound to feel depressed, enraged and/or annoyed. Then finally ,&quot;Sing&quot; hit the airwaves....and Music became enjoyable again. Infact the whole album is great, whenever I play the CD for a friend, I always get the same response:&quot;that's travis? they sound great&quot;. I suggest you unplug the radio, play this Travis CD, and rejoice, for Great Music is back!
081541028X|5.0|The spate of new books on the Apollo era, probably spurred by the success of the Apollo 13 movie, has been a godsend to enthusiasts like me, but this one stands out not just for it being written by a participant in 1975, but also because Collins turns out to be a gifted writer with a refreshing openness and humor. It's rather a shame he's apparently found no other subject to whet his literary whistle since then, as this is probably the most 'readable' book on the space program to date. In fact the moment I finished it I turned right back to page 1 and started again -- it was that enjoyable.
6305358613|5.0|The piece is a brilliant representaion of Elizabeth's ascention to the throne.  The the love bit was rather &quot;take-it-or-leave-it&quot; I found the overall story line to be full of energy however dark. Blanchet's performance is memorable and one of particular recognition (it brought her an Acadamy award nomination, though prior works are also very commendable). Fiennes also commanded attention as did Rush.  The plot contains many bits that could be considered grotesque, or gory, however these pieces were vital to the story line and had they been exempted the movie would not be the wonder that it is.
B00005KHJR|5.0|A friend brought this film to my attention in the mid-80s by declaring it was the &quot;greatest film ever made.&quot; I'd soon realize he'd developed a habit of saying that every time he liked a movie, but in this case I'm tempted to say it myself. The reason is that it's so utterly different that differences of opinion on its impact or likability are nearly irrelevant -- I'd praise it to the skies simply to honor those who had the courage to make something intelligent and thought-provoking. In other words, something that obviously wasn't going to have multitudes lining up to see it. For the DVD, the special-edition wooden box is nice in its way but unnecessary. I've heard complaints from those who found the re-included scenes on the extended version jarring for their obvious contrast with the rest of the film, but while it's possible I like the film too much to criticize any part, I still believe the story is better told with these scenes even if their image quality is unmistakably at variance with the whole. This is why I recommend the special edition, even if most of us have trouble figuring out where to store it.
B00005QZWI|5.0|Just recently I bought this soundtrack; every song is very impressive. The movie is fantastic above all! Enya is the perfect, actually quite beautiful from &quot;May it Be&quot; and &quot;Arwen and Aragorn&quot;. I have to say that each of these songs is never slow, boring, monotonous, etc. There is a young choir of boys(think &quot;Libera Me&quot; in Interview with the Vampire) in some parts of most of these songs. If anyone has not seen this movie first of all, see it. Listening to the music reminds you of the awesome scenes from LOTR. Anyway, if you are interested in this CD in any rate, I suggest you get your copy already! ~*~ Mal
B00004XOWM|2.0|Most albums take some time to get in to. I've had CD's that I absolutely hated and then given some time, I fell in love with them. Chocolate Starfish, no matter how many times I listen to it, is one of the worst CD's I own. First off, I'm not just another &quot;3 Dollar Bill Yall is the only good CD, Wes is the only good band member&quot; type person who uses the word sell-out on any band that gets radio play. This is just simply a very thoughtless album. There are a few good tracks, the Mission Impossible Theme remake, 'Take a Look Around' and the Scott Weiland produced 'Hold On' (To which he adds vocals) but overall, the songs on here are very very poorly written, poorly sung, and poorly played. Even the songs that are supposed to be thoughtful (The One, It'll Be OK) come off as corny. And what is with the lyrics to Boiler? &quot;No eating/no sleeping/It's all just more giving to you and I'm done.&quot; What? You're gonna starve yourself? OK. Pick up Limp Bizkit's first two albums and you won't be disappointed. Avoid this one.
B00005U122|5.0|I watched In The Flesh so many times. It is really a masterpiece of the genius of Roger Waters. The band is amazing too. This album shows the maturity of Roger Waters' music talent.<br />Roger Waters is one of few artists that genuinely open your mind through his genius of music, to the power of a few that control lots of people's lives and dominate the money machine whether directly or indirectly. This man is ahead of his time. I hope he continues in telling it as it is, with honesty and integrity. Music should be a message about truth and social justice, and Roger Waters' music is about that.<br />PEACE and LOVE for all.
B00003CY0V|3.0|Swordfish tells the story of a renegade group of former U.S. government spooks and their convoluted plans to steal hundreds of millions of dollars to finance their mysterious global plans. I don't want to give away too much of the story, but it's a bit far-fetched at the very least.<br />Hugh Jackman plays a computer hacker who just can't resist a big  caper. John Travolta is the enigmatic Gabriel, former black ops agent of the highest degree. Gabriel's scheme is a little foggy and his motives are horribly misguided. Halle Berry is little more than window dressing, her primary role to appear topless or in her lingerie in as many scenes as possible.<br />All in all, Swordfish is an entertaining action movie that's pretty short on plot and featuring a shady and overconvoluted conspiracy story. The action sequences are well-filmed and exciting, but like so many movies these days, this one depends on the excitement to carry the film rather than the story. It's a fun ride at times, but you come away fairly empty handed.
B000005DSN|5.0|&quot;Visions&quot; is what might be the finest moment of the legendary Finish power metal band Stratovarious.  To be fair, I'll go over the good and bad of this album.<br />Pro's: Stratovarius utilizes bullet-train power metal drums, simple but catchy riffs, well-ranged vocals, memorable choruses and awesome guitar/keyboard interplay to create songs in a vein that has served as a paragon for so many clones and rip-off's.  The Malmsteen-esque soloing of guitarist Timo Tolkki and fingerwork by keyboardist Jens Johansson adds wonderful life to the solid, simple song frameworks.  The keys play an important role in Stratovarious' sound, usually using a harpsichord effect, choir &quot;oohs&quot; and &quot;ahhs,&quot; or a synthetic guitar.  The moments when Tolkki and Johansson will play together, playing the same shred lick simutainiously, are amazing, perhaps best displayed on the instumental &quot;Holy Light.&quot;  While vocalist Timo Kotipelto leaves a little to be desired in my opinion, he has very good range and the vocal lines are great. <br />Con's: Stratovarious have a bit of a problem with copying themselves.  There are too many bands already doing that for them to be doing the same.  I would like to hear a little more complex songwriting, even more guitar/keyboard work, and how about some more classical guitar that is used sparingly but well on &quot;Visions.&quot;  And I could definitly do without the balads.  Don't worry; there are only two, but that is enough to throw a wrench in a non-stop playthrough.  Maybe I'm being a little picky with this one, but the lyrics throughout the album are so lame.  Almost every song seems to be devoted to some signifigant other.<br />The bottom line: This is pretty much essential for a big power metal or Stratovarious fan. While I would reccomend this over &quot;Destiny,&quot; &quot;Visions&quot; really isn't signifigantly better.
0451169514|4.0|this is the first King book I ever read, and it made me fall in love; I have read many others since, but still think It is his masterpiece, because most of the other disappointed me. This one is masterfully plotted and organized, leading smoothly and excitingly to the climax, and does not suffer from king's trouble with bum endings. one of the few Stephen King books I can read again without getting bored
0441172717|5.0|Dune is a complete sub-world; it has its own political struggles, its own history and its own religious traditions. The setting is in the distant future, thousands of years from the present.<br />The political system is based on the Imperium, the Great Houses and the Guild. The Imperium's military and economic power is balanced by the combined power of the Great Houses. The Guild, in turn, has exclusive monopoly over banking and space travel. The political system was established by the Great Convention, which set laws of war, principally the banning of nuclear weapons for combat purposes.<br />The religions of the novel are faintly similar to current religions; there are strands of Taoist and Islamic ideas scattered about. The Muad'dib is a messianic figure who is able to combine male and female traits. The main character, Paul Atreides, of House Atreides, becomes this Messianic figure on Dune. He has great persuasive ability, limited power to predict the future and many other almost super-human qualities.<br />Dune (the planet) is significant for its spice; spice is perhaps best described as a life-prolonging drug that is mildly or extremely addictive based on how much one consumes. However, the spice is produced by gigantic worms that make harvesting the substance dangerous to all but the native Fremen.<br />I really liked the political intrigue of the book, the scheming within the Great Houses, the Guild and the mystical/religious Bene Gesserit School; there is no clear all-powerful faction in this Universe.<br />The religions of the novel are strange. The characters frequently quote the Orange Catholic Bible. The novel's &quot;Terminology of the Imperium,&quot; says this about the O.C. Bible:<br />&quot;the 'Accummulated Book,' the religious text produced by the Commission of Ecumenical Translators. It contains sections if most ancient religions, including the Maometh Saari, Mahayana Christianity, Zesummo Catholicism and Buddislamic traditions. Its supreme commandment is considered to be: 'Thou shalt not disfigure thy soul'&quot; (page 525)<br />One of the Appendixes of the novel gives the religious history that led to the production of the O.C. Bible. The conditions leading up to that point are vaguely similar to the Thirty Year's War (1618-1648) in Europe; however, the outcome in the two cases was very different. In the European situation, the denominational theory of the Church (multiple denominations could peacefully coexist) was developed and the idea of separation of Church and State formed. In the history of the novel, the religious leaders form syncretistic religion. The leaders of the movement make their first public statement: &quot;We are here to remove a primary weapon from the hands of the disputant religions. That weapon - the claim to possession of the one and only revelation.&quot; (page 502)<br />It is unfortunate that an otherwise good novel makes such a basic philosophical error. In ruling out exclusive claims, the leaders cut the branch they're standing on. This means that their authority and writings can have no supreme claim, they are simply one among many equal options. The leaders included everybody but those who thought that there was only one way; they weren't really all-inclusive. <br />I don't know if I will lead the rest of the series but this first book was definitely a good read. One of things that I appreciated about the book is the fact that it takes religion seriously. In many of the futures commonly depicted in science fiction, religion of any sort is missing and secular humanism is triumphant. There were some parts of the novel that felt really slow and sometimes I would wonder when a certain section would end.
B000003TAB|5.0|....I LOVE Incesticide. And I must be the only Nirvana fan on the planet whose favorite song is Big Long Now. Why is this song so ignored? My god, the words, the haunting melody, the haunting vocals... ....<br />I won't get into analysing the songs and interpreting them blow-by-blow, but I will say that Kurt Cobain uses at least 7 different voices on this CD, and that each song is melodically and instrumentally genuine and original. The cover songs are also brilliant. <br />And here's just a little tidbit I have to mention: I became a Nirvana fan only quite recently. I was slightly too young for the whole Nirvana craze of 1991, and the tragedy of 1994. <BR>But when I recently purchased Nevermind, I was hooked. Now, I purchased that album of course because that was \\"the one to get\\". HOWEVER, in a matter of one week, I had heard both In Utero and Incesticide, and quite honestly I don't think the big blaring \\"WARNING\\"-s are all that important for first-time listeners of the less-commercial Nirvana, if those listeners know good music when they hear it. This is just pure, glorious music with a brain, the kind where you can't predict the ending before the song is halfway through. The kind that you can't sing along to all that easily. The kind where you have to make an effort, for god's sake. <BR>If the pop sap of today's various 'NStynks didn't drain you of your senses, get this CD. Don't be hesitant. And get Bleach and In Utero with it. There's more to Nirvana than Nevermind and Unplugged, as utterly fabulous as those two are (and my goodness, they are!). It might take a couple of listenings to get used to Incesticide. But only a couple. The quality will then speak for itself.
0525946284|5.0|D-Day is fast approaching, but the German army is too strong, too well coordinated, to assure success. And if the allied invasion failed, France and continental Europe will remain under Nazi control for years. A French resistance group, led by beautiful British spy Felicity (Flick) Clairet, is assigned a critical telecommunications center as a target but run into deadly resistance. Flick decides to go back, accompanied by an all-woman group who can pose as cleaners--but she doesn't count on the German counter-espionage expert, Major Dieter Franck, who picked up the pieces of her failed raid and sees her capture as a way of rolling up much of the French Resistance.<br />Much of the local support that Flick has counted on is already compromised by Dieter but she has no choice but to continue. D-Day has to be close--days or hours away, and failure by either side may literally mean the difference between winning and losing the war.<br />The war between Britain and Germany takes on a more personal tone as Dieter and Flick try to leapfrog the other, their motivations escalating from professional to highly personal over the course of the novel. Author Ken Follett does a wonderful job making Dieter somewhat sympathetic despite the Nazi regime he supports and the methods he uses to wring the truth from his captives. In the post-September 11 period, Dieter's identification of the French Resistance as terrorists adds impact to the story in a way that Follett probably did not expect.<br />Follett's story-telling is so smooth that JACKDAWS becomes almost experienced, like a movie, rather than a set of words on paper. I couldn't tell you much about Follett's style--I was too involved in the story.
0783229100|5.0|Newman and Redford did it again in their fantastic movie &quot;The Sting.&quot;  I was amazed when I saw &quot;Butch Cassidy and The Sundance Kid.&quot;  I thought that it was one of the best movies I had ever seen, but this topped that one by a whole lot!  I was amazed at the ending.  You will never guess, and to see what I am talking about you have got to see this movie.  I have seen a lot of movies in my time and I would have to say that &quot;The Sting&quot; is the best movie that I have ever seen.
0679600019|4.0|When Wilde landed in America in 1882 for a lecture tour, he was asked if he had anything to declare. He responded, &quot;Only my genius.&quot; Okay now, an attitude like that didn't exactly make me want to read any of his works for a long time. Finally, I decided to try The Picture of Dorian Grey, and I found that it really was a work of genius.<br />The novel is the story of Dorian Grey who at the beginning of the novel has his portrait painted by Basil Hallward. The picture turns out to be remarkable, and Grey becomes jealous because the picture will remain young and beautiful while he will age. He expresses a wish that the picture would age instead of himself. To his delight, his wish becomes true, and believing himself to be immortal, he embarks on a path of of hedonism. He always searches for pleasure above happiness, and above all things he loves beauty. Along the way, the portrait chronicles the total moral decay of Dorian Grey.<br />The are a lot of interpretations to this novel. My favorite is to read it as a moral tale warning of the consequences of leading a life of hedonism. It could almost be read as &quot;The Picture of Oscar Wilde&quot; as he seems to be criticizing his own lifestyle. This is probably also the most ironic reading of it since Wilde continued after the novel to preach aestheticism. But anyway, taken within itself, the novel is marvelous. The prose is well-polished. The pacing is elegant and the plot is always interesting. The points is makes are important. The Picture of Dorian Grey deserves its classic status, and Oscar Wilde actually was a bit of a genius.
B00005N83M|4.0|Is JLO a great singer? No, but she is certainly capable and delivers a great selection of pop, r&amp;b, and latin into her new album. It is a far superior album than the first. It has much better songs, and she just oozes sensuality is all of the songs. Best tracks include the funky Play and I'm Real, and the latin tinged Ain;t it Funny. She still falters on the ballads. They are quiet and sexy but her voice is very airy, and does not make them pleasurable to listen too. Overall. a very good album. I skipped a few tracks but the ones I did like, I listen to all the time.

0385505833|5.0|I read this book in one seating - about 2 hours.  I couldn't put it down - the emotions expressed were so real - Christmas CAN be a real hassle!  If carried to its extremes, it loses all meaning.  The resolution of the Christmas season for the Krank family was not what they had planned, but it worked out as a true celebration of the season - with compassion for the neighbors and love for family - not just a social event.  I loved the story, and probably will read it every Christmas season.
B00003CXDD|1.0|This one star rating is in no way an indication of what I think of the actual movie.  It is one of my favorite movies of all time.  I rented so many times I could've literally owned about 10 or 15 times over on VHS.  When I finally decided to buy it I couldn't find it anywhere so all I could do was wait for the DVD.  It has the bare minimum of extras on this DVD.  Trailers, behind the scenes and that's about it.  I want to be able to watch the movie with commentary.  I want Lucas and Howard interviews.  I want DELETED SCENES and OUTTACKES!  Every movie has deleted scenes and outtakes.  Not a single deleted scene is in this DVD.  Apparantly every DVD now adays is automatically a 'Special Edition' simply because it is now on DVD rather than VHS.  If one is going to call it 'Special Edition' they'd better deliver more than trailers.  In the end though I'm glad I did buy the DVD even if I was dissapointed with the lack of goodies; I'm simply happy to have the movie (and on DVD rather than VHS no less).  If you love the movie buy the DVD but don't expect lots of goodies to come along with the 'Special Edition' label.
6304708521|5.0|This is one of the beatles best! When it first came out it didn't go over as well as &quot;a hard day's night&quot; or &quot;help&quot; but it has become better over the years because it shows the wild sixties and what a movie made by 4 people on lsd should be (wild and crazy)! I would recomend it to anybody who dosn't have to understand every part of a movie.

B000002HHB|4.0|I love this album, and as I state above, when originality is at such a premium, this album is a rare find.
B00000I952|5.0|I believe this is the greatest of Abba's original albums. I like every single song on this album. Some of these songs don't appear on the &quot;Gold&quot; or &quot;More Gold&quot; albums, but every one is a classic. From the intense (and paranoid?)&quot;The Visitors,&quot; to the bitersweet  &quot;Slipping Through my Fingers,&quot; to the humorous &quot;Two for the Price of One&quot; (with a male lead vocal), this album is worth listening to.
0385505833|4.0|I think that John Grisham has a wonderful idea for this story. Christmas has become a major pain, well for me anyway. I'm really not trying to be a &quot;Scrooge&quot;, but as a single parent, the pressure seems overwhelming.<br />I digress. This book is great for a light, humorous look at a different sort of Christmas. Luther Krank had a great idea, but it was ruined by both his wife and daughter. It's a delightful read. Merry Christmas!
B00004SCX6|5.0|I just love this PoP CD from Brit. One of my online friends bought this CD for me, and mailed it to me. When I listened to it at the computer I loved it. my friend ,,she also has the Oops! CD, and I listened to hers when I stayed at her house ,so I know what the songs sounded like before I got it. I also know that some people hate Britney, either buy her dressing or singing voice or that she doesn't write her own songs. But please people grow up & don't judge Brit by the way she dresses or how her voice sings or that she doesn't write her own songs. I used to not like Britney..myself until I got this CD!!! Now I'm getting use to liking this girl. She has da coolest PoP singing voice. Please don't listen to those people who say not to buy this CD.. Just buy it! My CD is the European Version, so it has one extra track called \\"Girl In The Mirror\\" That song is good. My favorite tracks are \\"Stronger\\" , \\"Lucky\\" , and \\"Cant make you love me\\" Great work Brit!!!
0425163407|4.0|This book started off looking like a serial killer mystery, with a modus operandi of sawing off the limbs and leaving the trunk of the victims for the police to discover.  As Dr Scarpetta quickly discovers, though, what's really happening with the latest event is a copycat version of the past nine crimes.  Why is a copycat?  To hide what the killer was really doing.  You'll be amused by the timely plotline, with the medical details that appear authentic and chilling.  The exposure of the real killer at the end was a surprise, but I was not impressed with the killer's motive.  Overall, this book reads better than most Cornwell books, and the pages fly by.
B00000DGUG|4.0|I believe think &quot;Thank U&quot; is the best song Alanis has done (with the possible exception of &quot;Uninvited&quot;) so the album is worth buying for that alone. &quot;So Pure&quot; is also a great one, and both of them are at least as good as the hits from her previous album, which is why I am surprised that they get much less airplay than those earlier songs.
B00005J9M3|5.0|When I first purchased this album, I was just going into high school.  I did not think too much of it then, considering I was addicted to the group's previous hits like 'Always on My Mind,' Oppurtunities,' and 'West End Girls.'  Their sound matured as my taste did not.  In my first year of college, I relistened to the album on a rainy day and fell in love with it.  It is, in general, their darkest album, dealing with issues(AIDS, death) many people would rather not acknowledge.  However, Neil's voice is so bitterly soulful in these songs and Chris Lowe's keyboarding is an audio masterpiece, one cannot help but enjoy them.<br />'My October Symphony,'  a personal favorite, is loaded with allusions to the Russian Oktober Revolution, and contains a string quartet.  Interestingly enough, this song was the inspiration for Guns 'n' Roses 'November Rain.'<br />This is, in my opinion, their best album.

B000008B01|5.0|Next to his debut recordings in the late 1950s and the classic Getz/Gilberto albums, this is Joao Gilberto's finest work.  A hauntingly quiet, beautiful album.  Highly recommended &amp; a definite must-have for anyone who wants to delve a bit deeper into the best of bossa nova...
B00003CXSP|5.0|Hannibal is a horror masterpiece. It is an exotic, sensual, and sensory experience in which beauty reigns over decadence. Unlike The Silence of the Lambs, Hannibal is a genre film, which is essentially why it has been so cruelly dismissed. The film by Jonathan Demme is a &quot;psychological thriller&quot; while Hannibal is a gore film closer to the films of Dario Argento and Lucio Fulci than say Alfred Hitchcock. But unlike the wave of teenage oriented slasher films of the last few years, Hannibal is made for adults with a sense of aesthetics.<br />Director Ridley Scott cared about this film and it shows. Hannibal is one of the most beautifully conceived films of 2001. Cinematographer John Mathieson and Ridley Scott have created a world filled with subtle and precise lighting and color tones that ooze with both sensuality and dread. The score by Hanz Zimmer is also one of the most emotional and complex piece of instrumental music of any contemporary year. Zimmer uses classical instruments and classically inspired sounds to convey powerful emotions, from the romantic (&quot;The Burning Heart&quot;) to the chilling (&quot;Dear Clarice&quot;). Most admirable is the original opera composition which uses a libretto from Dante's &quot;La Vita Nuova&quot;, making it the first text of the Italian poet to ever be put to music in a film.<br />Of course, we cannot talk about Hannibal Lecter, now a legendary film and literary villain, without talking about Anthony Hopkins who plays the character for the second time. In the Ridley Scott film, Dr. Lecter becomes the main character, giving Hopkins the opportunity to explore the character's complexities. For some reason, Lecter isn't as scary in Hannibal as he was in The Silence of the Lambs which was one of the main problems for the numerous critics and filmgoers who refuted the film upon its release (and still do to this day). But what Hopkins does bring to his slightly transformed Lecter is dark humor and charisma. Lecter delivers a series of memorable one-liners (&quot;I'm giving very serious thought...to eating your wife&quot;, &quot;Your little brother must smell as badly as you do by now&quot;, &quot;spoken like a true Protestant&quot;, &quot;You've met Mason...face to face, so to speak&quot;, etc.) establishing his attractive yet perverse nature. Lecter's presence is also felt by his eerie stillness, wicked smile, and gentleman appeal.<br />In Hannibal, Julianne Moore takes over the role that Jodie Foster made famous in the previous Thomas Harris film adaptation. Like most people, when I first heard that Jodie Foster had officially declined the role of Starling in the so-called sequel to Lambs, I was disappointed and expressed doubts about the credibility of the movie. But once I got passed the initial shock of losing Jodie Foster and learned of Moore's involvement in the film I was most pleased. Julianne Moore was already one of my favorite actresses. With movies like Boogie Nights, The End of the Affair, and The Myth of Fingerprints Moore proved to be one of the best actresses working today. I still sometimes wonder why Jodie Foster rejected the part considering the participation of Ridley Scott and Anthony Hopkins. Nevertheless, a character does not belong to an actor, no matter what, especially when that character comes from a literary source. In fact, in Micheal Mann's Manhunter, Lecter was played by Brian Cox. In the upcoming remake of Manhunter, Red Dragon-the original title of the novel by Thomas Harris, Harvey Keitel will play the role of Jack Crawford. In Manhunter, Dennis Farina played Crawford. In Lambs, it was Scott Glenn. Thus, if you are willing to see Hannibal as a separate entity, not a sequel to the more sober but just as great Jonathan Demme film, you can savor Julianne Moore's emotionally measured performance.<br />In the DVD's audio commentary, Ridley Scott offers a fascinating and informative analysis of his film while responding to the various criticisms that have plagued Hannibal (ex. why is Lecter without plastic surgery? why the pigs? what is the relation between Cordell and Mason?, and so on). Besides the commentary, the DVD provides an interesting but somewhat shallow documentary, fantastic multi-angle featurettes of the opening action scene, wonderful trailers and TV Spots, an extraordinary photo gallery, and much more...<BR>One of the best DVD's of the year.<br />For me, Hannibal is a film to cherish...although it will never become the phenomena that was The Silence of the Lambs, nor will it win any major awards, but I believe that with time it will become a cult classic much like Argento's Suspiria, the Evil Dead films, De Palma's The Phantom of the Paradise, Big Trouble in Little China, The Wicker Man, or even Kubrick's Eyes Wide Shut.

B00003CXZ4|5.0|Memento is without a doubt an ingenious and clever thriller, and for that it should be fully commended.  But the supposed messages people pick up on about the nature of reality and the plight of Leonard's character should not be taken as seriously.  Sure it's horrible that Leonard has to suffer due to his anterograde memory loss, and it is ok to develop a sense of sympathy for him in the moment, but it should not be taken as the heart of the movie.  Similarly, his skewed perception of reality should not be seen as an excuse to interpret the movie as a deeper metaphysical analysis of every day life and the reality which surrounds us.  It is merely a tool used to add to the suspense and drama of the thriller, and it is here that the heart of the movie truly lies.  Memento is an engrossing and deceptive thriller...nothing else.  No deeper analysis of life, no great human drama or tragedy.  Leave it at that, and this is definitely one to remember.  And to those who bitched and moaned because the movie was backwards and as a result confusing, I can only say one thing:  develop a sense of fun and adventure for a change!
B00004U30D|5.0|Wow ! I don't know what else to say. This is now my favorite movie of all time. It Rules !
B00005RFAI|5.0|&quot;Pop artist&quot;, Pink, opens new doors in the world of music with her second album 'Missundastood'. With powerful vocals, award worthy lyrics and an innovative production team the release is truly a modern masterpiece. The singer releases feelings of: anger, aggression, sadness and confusion with dignity and pride not proclaiming to be perfect despite her position in the land of fame and forunate. In songs such as the adolscent 'Dear Diary', breathtaking 'Lonely Girl' and emotionally charged 'Family Portrait' and singer begins to show listeners a true glimpse of who she truly is, and perhaps who we all are deep inside. Legendary greats Steven Tyler and Linda Perry lend their efforts to this amazing piece and further compliement the already redefining album. Pink never looked at herself as a role model or idol, nor did anyone else. But perhaps, she truly is for showcasing truth in her music...Because in the end we are all misundastood........

6305531412|1.0|Let me just get this straight: I love \\"Who Framed Roger Rabbit\\". If this DVD had a good transfer, good extras, and uncensored, I would have gone for it's purchase and give it a 5.<BR>The problem is, this DVD is the opposite on what I would have gone for.<BR>The transfer is a botch job with blurs, sandy in the tan areas, overbright in reds, has a grimmy sound transfer, and IS censored in two parts.<BR>Are there any extras? No. Unlike what the lying eyes of the box says, no. And the film is only 14 years old.  It deserves extras, at least a theatrical trailer and pencil test.<BR>I'd wait for a special edition.
0060977493|5.0|What secures this book the title extraordinary is not its narrative power which is considerable, nor its sparse, telling dialogue; it is the terrifying cloud of violence which envelopes the characters and setting alike.
B00005QZ7U|1.0|I'll never trust a critic again.  Looked like a poor MTV video covered by amateurs.  I absolutely hated this.  Maybe, I'm being unfair since after an hour, I could no longer stand the pain and turned it off.  I promised my wife I would put a review on Amazon.com to let others know to beware!  Anybody that says they liked this either has never seen a movie or is lying.  Believe me, I love movies and am tolerant.  I even found some good points in \\"Eyes Wide Shut\\" and watched \\"Far and Away\\" a couple of times.  DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME ON THIS!!!
B00005RIKD|5.0|I came across Sting's Tuscany A&amp;E concert early Dec 2001 quite by accident and heard &quot;When We Dance&quot; for the very first time and was blown away.  I immediately went out and purchased this CD.<br />I've been trapped in music vortex since about 1994.  The FM dial of my car stereo is permanently wired off.  I simply don't listen to FM anymore for fear of a Britney gag attack while motoring my poor innocent man-child to the super market.<br />For at least 10 years, I've considered Sting too commercial and consisting of way too much filler.  Those feeling have changed.<br />This CD is awesome.<br />I will spare everyone the step by step review of each song and hit the highlights.  For starters, it's a &quot;live&quot; album and as mentioned by numerous reviewers before me, very jazzy.<br />The song &quot;Perfect Love Gone Wrong&quot; is much better on this CD.  The French rap is replaced by a jazzy sounding piano solos.  &quot;Don't Stand So Close to Me&quot; simply sounds great.  Sting is accompanied by a celloist and really provides a new perspective to a classic.<br />Given the sad events of Sept 11, &quot;Fragile&quot; will move you to tears.  &quot;When We Dance&quot; and &quot;1000 Years&quot; are both beautiful love songs.  Listening to &quot;Moon over Bourbon Street&quot; was like meeting an old friend.  I wanted to immediately reread Rice's &quot;Interview With a Vampire.&quot;<br />You really can't go wrong with this CD.  It's jazzy, relaxing, and provides great listening during the quiet moments at home with loved ones or alone.
B00000J61Z|5.0|This Album was my first glam rock album I bought back in 1984. Never even heard a single song from the album but bought it anyway purely based from all the hype around high school. It was one of the best decisions I've made and had a huge impact on me. Every Album I bought after that was compared to it. When I hear any song from this Album now, a rush of good memories race through my head giving me a good feeling and a sense of pride from knowing, &quot;I could'nt have picked a better time to grow up in Long Beach, CA&quot;.  This Album was so pure without all the fake synthesizers and such, just four guys with instuments and talent. There were alot of little things going on in this album that alot of people didn't catch, like in &quot;Come on and dance&quot; the cow bells were hit six times in three sets(6-6-6). None of us were into that sort of thing but we thought it was cool how they hid messages in thier songs. In the CD that was released in 99, there are 4 songs that weren't on the original. I must say as much as I love Motley crue, I understand why they were left out. I felt they didn't flow well with the rest of the Album. The &quot;Too fast for love&quot; Alternate intro, lacks feeling. They did a good thing by leaving them out of the original. The timing of this album came at a perfect time, it kick started the rock scene. I've always thought that without this album, I wouldn't have had all the good times back then nor the good memories now.My Thanx to the Crue.
B00005K3OT|4.0|Both my wife and I thought the premise sounded ridiculous and were reluctant to watch this.  However, I made a last minute sweep of Blockbuster for our New Year's Eve movie watching and it was in plentiful supply so I grabbed a copy.  Wow, what a surprise!!<BR>We both loved it and it is now on my &quot;buy&quot; list.  A cute story, wonderful photography, some excellent acting and a happy ending.<BR>A great way to start 2002....
B000007T1M|4.0|Dont get me wrong TOXICITY is an excellent cd and is even better than this album in my opinion but sometimes I like coming back to this CD and remembering SOAD before they got all mature and popular. System of a Down, is a very good band although now very trendy they are a band I will continue to follow no matter how popular they get. On TOXICITY System's songs are much more elaborate and their is much more singing involved. This album focuses more on raw power and some people may like this better. Best songs are &quot;Suite-Pee&quot;, &quot;War?&quot;, &quot;P.L.U.C.K.&quot; and of course &quot;Sugar&quot;. If you are a trendy person and you bought TOXICITY because you thought the song &quot;Chop Suey was cool&quot; I would recommend buying this album and maybe I will respect you more.
B00003CXS4|5.0|English film made by the director of &quot;Lock Stock and Two Smoking Barrells&quot;. Lock Stock was a classic and did well in most countries but America. <br />Snatch is not a follow up but a film featuring similar elements. It is set in an English underworld of illegal boxing matches hit men and Jewel Heists. <br />The film is in reality a comedy but it is a violent one. It has a complex structure which is the interweaving of of three basic sets of characters who are invovled in fixing a fight and trying to recover a stolen diamond. Unlike many comedies it falls outside the normal formulas and the twists and turns of the plot have you in stiches. <br />The DVD is probably better than the film as it is easier to understand the dialogue using the subtitle function. Even Brad Pitt is good.
B00005OWIU|5.0|John Williams again demonstrates that he is the master at <BR>capturing the essence of the movie in his soundtrack music.<br />My favorite is &quot;Hedwig's Theme&quot;. <br />Jeff Shannon is correct in his comments about self-plagarism.<BR>I find &quot;Hedwig's Theme&quot; reminiscent of the the theme played <BR>for the alien spacecraft in &quot;Independence Day&quot;.
B00005MP58|2.0|The show itself is worth five stars.  The DVD is not. I bought this for my wife's Christmas present.  We love the show, had watched the VHS version over and over, and thought that the wide-screen DVD would be a good addition.  The wide-screen and improved sound quality is really neat.  However, the picture quality is so bright as to be washed out...compared either with broadcast or the older VHS.
0790733226|5.0|This movie is what I call &quot;Pure&quot; Sci-Fi... one that takes our reality, then adds a Science-Fiction element to it.  [i]Contact[/i] will not bore you if you get into the movie.  Ellie Arroway, portrayed beautifully by Jodie Foster, shows you just what a scientist's life is like, slightly Hollywoodized, on the silver screen.  Her spiritual, emotional, and scientific journey is one I don't think you'll want to miss.<br />Are there aliens out there?  Is the main question and plot of this movie.  &quot;It would be an awful waste of space.&quot;<br />It also delves a bit into the politics of the science world, which is refreshing and different for a Sci-Fi film.  The plot is also quite similar to the book, which I also recommend reading.<br />The DVD, while preserving the sound and video to almost perfection, has included some worthwhile features.  The &quot;making of&quot; sequences tell quite a bit how a movie comes to light.<br />Last but not least, if you're still not convinced, then you should get the movie just for the beginning and climax.  Keeping an open mind will help you understand just how those parts of the film are interesting, theoretical, and contraversial.
0385484518|5.0|I was given this book by a teacher of mine, and he told me he thought I would get something from reading it. And I did. He gave me the book third period and I was done with it by 7:30 the same day. I couldnt put it down mostly because Morrie reminds me of my grandfather. He was a worker and never stopped until he had to. And that was when he was diagnossed with lung cancer and put into a hospital. Morrie brought great things into this world, and Mitch was lucky enough to share on those things. I love this book because I've never read anything like it in my life. It shows a man who is going to die, and insted of thinking about death, he thinks about his life and how you should live life;to the fullest.
0201485672|5.0|Along with Design Patterns, Refactorings is a significant step forward in software engineering. I actually found this book to be more useful than the popular Design Patterns book. Most software developers do not write new code from scratch. Instead they have to enhance and maintain code written by other developers. This book provides many useful techniques to make this job easier. To some degree, I found I was already using techniques like these in my own day-to-day work. This book, like Design Patterns, collects these techniques and makes them available to everyone.
B000053GTK|4.0|\\"In a Glass House\\" came at a pivotal point in the band's existence, being that it came after founding member Phil Shulman's departure. That must have been a blow to the other Shulmans and Kerry Minnear, being that the band had just hit its creative peak on \\"Octopus,\\" a release that many (including me) think is their best.<br />That being the case, the boys really must have sucked it up because this is a remarkable album, harder to get into at first than the other albums from their peak period, but ultimately rewarding. The thing about complex music like this is you never get tired of it. You play it over and over.<br />And make no mistake, this is a complex album, harder edged than anything recorded with Phil (a trend that would continue through to \\"Interview\\", the beginning of the creative end for the band). It likewise brings Derek's lunatic bellow to the forefront which doesn't bother me but bothers many others (including my wife). There's nothing \\"precious\\" about this progressive band, a few listens to \\"The Runaway\\" (one of their all-time greats) and \\"Way of Life\\" will make that quite clear.<br />The only thing holding me back from giving this five stars is \\"An Inmate's Lullaby,\\" an all-percussion and vocals piece. It's clever, but never takes off for me. It's kind of annoying, actually. I must also say that the live version of \\"In a Glass House\\" thrown in as a bonus (it's really a jam built around the last part of that song) is of bootleg quality, hardly listenable, although it is interesting to \\"hear\\" Gary Green and John Weathers freak out with wild abandon.<br />A great album. But I think \\"Octopus\\" and \\"Freehand\\" are better and rate five stars.
B000002TYK|4.0|After the end of one of the biggest alternative groups in history, Dave Grohl, the former drummer, regroups with an album that proves him to be a great lead singer and guitarist.  Of the three albums Dave and his cohorts have put out, this is by far their best.  Do get the other two if you can (&quot;The Colour And The Shape&quot; and &quot;There Is Nothing Left To Lose&quot;) for they are still good.  It's just that their self-titled debut is very raw and more guitar-oriented than the other two.  Plus, the production isn't as slick as the production on the other two.  In other words, Dave and the boys just let it all hang out!  Dave plays and screams out the passion in him in songs like &quot;This Is A Call&quot;, &quot;I'll Stick Around&quot;, and &quot;Floaty&quot;.  There are some quiet ones too, mind you (i.e., &quot;For All The Cows&quot;).  But overall, this is a record that is meant to be played loud!  &quot;Foo Fighters&quot; would pass as an excellent indie-rock record.  Well done, Dave!
B000000H66|5.0|This album which came out in a year of the worst music in history should have been the top album of the year by far on metal charts. This album is where the more progressive Chuck shines. While still true to the sound he'd help many years earlyer he makes an effort which truely shocked many.  Note onto the review of each song:   1. Symbolic - Great intro. You can already see his new sound shining in the music. It's a fast and good starting track.  . . .85% 2. Zero Tolerance - Cool darker sounding song. You would have to listen to understand.  . . . 90% 3. Empty Words - Soft intro but soon you see the Chuck screaming like he should. A song about lies we believed in our hearts that we find are killing us.  . . .85%  4. Sacred Serenity - All so strong a song. I really enjoy the solo of chuck's in there. I can feel his soul in that part.  . . .95%   5. 1,000 Eyes - Heavy and powerful song. All about the future. We're being watched my dear friend.  . . .95% 6.

The subject is so well spoke of.  . . .100% 8. Misanthrope - Sort of a weaker song on here. The messenge is odd tho.  .  . .75%  9. Perennial Quest - Sort of progressive track as well. Speaking of his walk in life.  . . .90%If you like this album: Any death album would about due but I suggest.... Spiral Healing and Thought Patterns.I have a few more things to say. I for one probably would have waited longer if it had not been for Chucks death. I'm saddened by his death and I wish his Family the best and love. To those who care for chuck, please buy : Death - Live in L.A. (Death &amp; Raw) and then buy the cd and dvd they offer called &quot;Live In Eindhoven&quot;. $2.50 of the money spend on the other Live album and Dvd go to his fund. Support Metal! Support Chuck's Family!
B00005NOOH|5.0|When investing in any DVD, especially a boxed set, you might ponder the question, &quot;How often will I watch this?&quot; Let me say that your purchase of The World at War will offer you endless viewing opportunities! Besides the 26 original episodes, all of the extra features that were produced afterwards are included in the set. There is so much information generated in over 30 hours of material that you will discover something new with each repeated viewing. Each episode will hold your attention from first to last, and they are efficiently indexed so you can easily review a map or replay a speech. Along side the emotional impact of the pictorial images, you have Carl Davis' moving score, a judicious use of period music, personal accounts from all the major powers, and Sir Laurance's strong narration, making this the most comprehensive documentary on the subject. Now if we can only have World War I, narrated by Robert Ryan, available, we would have the documentary bookends to the two most devastating wars in the 20th century.
B000002KDO|5.0|The 3rd album sometimes is oddly forgotten by some. But as you may hear by the sound clips by Amazon they are also many hits on this album. Infact not one song is filler.

B0000508U6|5.0|Coldplay is infectious. On this, their most powerful and successful recording to date, they have achieved what many bands of their generation have sought - respect, acclaim and the listening ears of the alt-music consumer. Any band that takes risks, invents new ways of expressing themselves and actually pays attention to the craft of songwriting and the beauty of words gets extended spins on my playlist.<BR>Comparisons to Radiohead and Travis are so way off base. The band's individuality can be compared to no other group. The only comparison with Radiohead, Travis, et al., is that great British innovative vibe that sounds so new, real and experimental. The end result has Coldplay and their peers soaring high above so many of the abyssmal pop acts out there these days.<BR>The vocals of lead singer Chris Martin are quite simply the crowning achievement of this masterful CD. They are sincerely heartfelt, real and oh so perfect. The falsetto he creates on all of the tracks fits perfectly with the overall aura of the recording.<BR>Naturally, the stand out tracks are the popular &quot;Yellow&quot; and the sleeper &quot;Trouble&quot; - both magnificent creations of word and music. However, the wonderful aspect of this CD is that the same thing can be said of the entire CD. The lead-off track &quot;Don't Panic&quot; is understated in it's delivery. &quot;Shiver&quot; and &quot;Spies&quot; are brilliantly delivered by Martin's wonderfully infectious British accent. Comparisons to Neil Young's falsetto will naturally occur but Martin has something very distinct in his vocals that make listening to him sing a pure and soothing joy. The closing track &quot;Everything's Not Lost&quot; is a perfect wrap up for this sonic masterpiece.<BR>This is unquestionably a desert island disc. Understated class.
B00005AXEL|5.0|This CD is amazing!  The songs with the other artists (Sheryl Crow, ect) really help to bring out her performance.  Those of you who thought Stevie's career was over, just listen to the beautiful songs on this CD, and you'll change your tune!  Sorcerer, Every Day, and Love is, have  to be the three best songs she's done since Rhiannon with Fleetwood Mac and Edge of Seventeen.<BR>  I give major kudos to Stevie for returning and making more beautiful music for us all to enjoy, and I just hope that we'll be seeing more from her in the future.  I'd hate to have to live without another CD.
B00003CY0V|3.0|Too many implausibilities in this movie to make it really amount to much, good for light entertainment only. It seems reasonable to me that some hothead would think he knows better than the government about how to conduct foreign policy. I also can see how he might want to divert funds to pay for his operations (and might need a hacker to do that)but from there on out Swordfish gets farther and farther away from reality. If Travolta's character has all of the people (some of whom would have to have inside connections)and resources such as the cargo helicopter that carries the bus in the getaway, what does he need a hacker to steal money for? Such a man would already have funds to run assasination operations due to his connections. Halle Berry topless at the poolside makes more real world sense than that. I also didn't care for the 20 pounds of C-4 with ball bearings on the hostages bit, putting bombs on them makes sense in a cruel sort of way but not enough explosive on each one to take out 20 jets each. That stuff would be expensive and wasteful, he could've killed hundreds if not thousands of America's enemies with what he was prepared to waste on a few innocent hostages, all in the name of providing a little security and pressure the cops.
B00005JCA9|5.0|I bought this movie on impules(something i do more now) and immediatly was won over. It is a wonderfully casted, crafted movie and is perfectly charming. The cast is so very balanced and no one is underdevloped showing how normal hardships are equal to the mega hardships of the central characters. The seasonal montage is very clever and unique i think, and the clash of lives is very well provided for. The friends are so genuine you  feel instantly welcome in their lives and homes. So many clever scenes that the movie never lags and is wonderful to see again and again.<BR>The ending with the press conference is just about as perfect as it can me..breathlessly timed and even after seeing it many times i still feel i don't know how it will come out..can you say that for many movies?<BR>JULIA IS RADIANT THROUGH OUT..
B000003BEV|4.0|Being blunt, I  knew only one other person growing up who owned this album and thought it was good.   The original album cover was cool as you could turn the cover a certain way and see the faces of the Beatles peering out of the flower heads.   I recently bought the CD version of this album and listened to it the other day (after at least 20 years) and parts of it have held up.  &quot;She's Like a Rainbow&quot; is still one of my all time favorite Stones tunes.  I used to think &quot;Citadel&quot; was a good tune, but I guess my taste changed with age.  2000 Man has also held up after all this time.  It's by far not the best Stones album, but there are morsels of good music to be heard on their adventure into psychedelia.
B00005QW5X|5.0|I love Hedwig and the Angry Inch. It's one of my favorite movies. It's fun, the music is awesome (AWESOME!), it's well made and superbly acted. I can't tell you how great it is to see a seriously written film about love and sexual identity and still be this much fun! The DVD is full of great things, too. An 85 min docu, comm. by dir. and and cinematographer, and lots more. I highly recommend this movie.
B000035P7X|5.0|I have watched this documentary at least three times and never get tired of seeing it.  This documentary follows Dylan on a tour through England and the viewer gets to play a fly on the wall as you watch this genius interact with the likes of Alan Price (The Animals), Joan Baez, and Donovan.  For me, Dylan's music is not the highlight of this film---it was watching a young musician who had just reached new heights of fame deal with the media, the public, the promoters, and the groupies.  My favorite part of the film is the scene inside Dylan's hotel where Joan Baez is singing a gorgeous song with her guitar and Dylan is pounding on a typewriter, seemingly oblivious to Baez's singing.  He comes across as somewhat arrogant, but who can blame him?  This shows the human side of Dylan, and shouldn't be missed by any fan.
B00003CXMG|3.0|...but I still expected a little more from Cameron Crowe.<br />As an avid fan of Crowe's work and any music addict's connection to the concept of this plot, I had to check it out. So if you are a music junky and want to watch an amusing flick, this is the one for you. It stands out amongst recent blockbusters -- but that isn't really saying much..<br />I would like to point out a couple really good points:<br />1. Commendable research. Check the credits. Peter Frampton and Kelly Curtis (who was at the time bus driver to Heart, and currently is a hot shot band manager) were listed as 'technical consultants,' plus Cameron, himself, was active in the rock scene at the time and has been since. He knows his stuff.<br />2. The faux band that the film is centered upon was actually composed (musically) of none other than my favorite guitarist, Mike McCready (lead guitarist in Pearl Jam) -- and all other parts were played by talented musicians who actually took the time to put together original songs to suit the movie and its characters (and the songs were pretty good).<br />In regards to the script, I have to say that the entire thing was a little too *cute* to be taken seriously.... who wouldn't love to be that kid? It's charming and fun and all that... the outcast smartypants sends his school articles to a major magazine and then of course the editor befriends and hires him -- and to top it all off, the 15 year old music geek somehow manages to get hired by Rolling Stone to follow one of his favorite bands around and write a cover story with no experience (or even having to meet any RS staff) and becomes buddies with the lead guitarist, to boot. I'm sorry but the entire premise was a bit hard to believe and cookie-cutter perfect (even for 1973)...<br />..but it's still better than wasting your money on one of the shamelessly BAD movies that are commanding the theaters these days.
B00004U2GH|5.0|Johnny Cash went to Folsom and San Quentin prisons in the late 60's and recorded two of the best country albums ever recorded.  This is my favorite of the two live performances, especially &quot;Big River&quot;, &quot;Wreck of the Old '97&quot; and &quot;He Turned the Water into Wine.&quot;  You get the sense that Cash truly felt compassion for the prisoners and did his very best in this performance.  This album is not just for country fans but would probably enjoyed by some rock and roll fans as well.
B00005QZ7U|5.0|I have to agree with the rest of the reviewers who say that Nicole Kidman and Ewan McGregor leave something to be desired in the singing category, but there is so much about this movie, and whats more, the DVD that makes it easy to overlook the singing.  Besides, even though Moulin Rouge is a musical, Baz Luhrman and Craig Pierce did not set out to create the next Phantom. Moulin Rouge is a clever movie, with witty, beautiful use of contemporary songs.  They are a lark.  They are not meant to be the next inclusion on Barbara Streisand's 15th Easy Listening album.  The story is admittedly a send up of old opera story lines.  How old can you get?  Its plot is not tired, rather it is--if i may say again--clever.  With elements of Offenbach's *Orpheus in the Underworld* (Christian comes from on high, and goes to the *underworld* of Paris, wherin he tries to rescue his love from there) and Verdi's *La Traviata* (complete with Christian throwing money at Satine, paying his whore, not to mention her tuberculosis)<br />I had absolutely no desire to see this film when i saw the promo MTV \\"Marmalade\\" video, and before i saw the film on dvd, i heard the soundtrack, and wondered what in the blazes was going on, Ewan wasn't the next Broadway star, but he at least sounded robust and strong, as opposed to Kidman, who nonetheless sounded sweet.  El Tango de Roxanne is a great song, and the strongest element that got me to see the movie, besides reccomendations from friends.  And from there, i was hooked.  All of the music made sense, Kidman didn't even sound nearly as weak as in the soundtrack.  The dances are phenomenal, and every element is truly, truly clever.  The DVD makes it even better, with more extras than you can shake a stick at.  Oh yeah, and Kylie Minogue makes a really nice green fairy.
B00005LOUS|5.0|This film clearly explains my definition for a good movie, it has comedic dialogue that you would never hear the Grinch say in the animated movie.  That's what seperates this one from that one.  Also, this adaptation provides a back story to why the Grinch hates Christmas, and Ron Howard decided he would add some things to spice up this classic tale, which he did a very good job on, I must say.  This is, overall, one of best movies I have ever seen.  It is definately worth spending money on.
B00005AAFS|2.0|While the vocals are decent and some of the songs are alright, it's too overall repetetive.
0345451325|5.0|I normally do not like science fiction but after playing halo and seeing how good the game was i couldn't wait to get my hands on the book. I reccomend that everyone who enjoyed halo will love eric nylund's the fall of reach.
B00005R87Q|4.0|The only thing about the movie is that it does have a predictable plot to the movie, you can figure out what's going on with-in the first 10 mins of the movie, but the action, and racing sequences well make-up for the plot. Being from the import street racing scene the images of squeeling wheels, souped up imports, and NOS in the back are all familiar scenery to me, but the computers and laptops are a bit over the top, only the best of the best use laptops and computers in conjunction with the actual racing. The blowing of the pistons into the cockpit of the car in the first racing sequence is all to familiar and I found it very realistic and believable. The camera following the moves of switching of gears, then following right into the bowels of the transmission then following out to the back of the car, pumps you up and gets you ready for more! The best action I've seen in a movie in a while, and a great break from the &quot;cartoon movies&quot; that are plagueing us now. <br />Spike
B0000508U6|1.0|The music is 'nice' but the lyrics are junk. But most people don't listen to lyrics anyways (see the other reviews).
B00005AWMF|4.0|With the full realization that I'll probably be receiving some angry e-mails concerning this review I thought I'd play 'devils advocate' for a moment and award a less than sterling review of Sade's \\" Best of \\" disc. While I find Sade a gifted singer/songwriter I'm at a loss as to the degree of her popularity. While never being one to 'spoil the party' I must simply question all these 5 star ratings and incredible accolades that fan's of this artist seem to lavish upon her. Thus borrowing a phrase from W. Shakespeare \\" I come to praise Sade... not to bury her! \\" <br />In the music genre referred to as 'smooth jazz' saying a disparaging word about Sade to her legions of admirer's is rather like speaking ill of the dead. While you may have never cared for them it is simply bad form not to keep these small criticisms to yourself. With that being said, Sade is praised to no end for her smooth style of singing and for composing songs that are extremely 'user friendly' when it comes to getting air-play on your local radio station. Her forte seems to be tunes that are slightly exotic, ultra-smooth ( there's that word again! ), with some nice sax in the break and ultimately everything sounding warm and sexy. And while there's nothing wrong with that....why do I need to hear those same stylistic musings in almost all that she releases? While she is indeed a somewhat talented ( albeit at times flat ) singer she is also, unfortunately, at risk of becoming a 'one-trick pony'. As previously stated there are some very nice things here, \\" Kiss Of Life \\", \\" No Ordinary Love \\" and \\" Is It A Crime \\" are all very well conceived, and executed, songs that do hold a listener's attention and I like them immensely ( especially the drums in \\"Stronger Than Pride\\" ) but asking me to get through this entire disc without being able to 'shuffle' with two or three other cd's is more than I can handle. While other's find an almost hypnotic quality to her songs ( and I'll admit there is that! ) I find an album where one song can be difficult to distinguishable from the next! Perhap's it's the complete lack of any rough edge's in her music that fan's find spellbinding....but this listener finds it also slightly bland . Plus, she does tend to sing all these selections in a rather vulnerable, earnest and breathless tonal quality that gets old after a short while. An occassional change in tempo would be nice! And, except for the wonderfully pleading track \\" Please Send Me Someone To Love \\" the only selection here not written by Ms. Adu, there's not much of that to be found. <br />Overall, while I realize it sounds as if I'm being overly judgemental on this artist I'm, in all actuality, not being harsh at all. I truly do enjoy Sade as an artist and, casting aspertions aside, do listen to this cd more than one would think. I suspect that I'm just at a loss as to why music lover's award her so much attention....especially when there are so many other female singers who I feel are worthy of our support and consideration as well. Sade may be the \\"sweetest taboo\\" but that doesn't make her a true jazz singer.
B00005OAJ1|5.0|This band is hilarious! Yes, I have heard their songs from the acoustic shows, so shut up. Kyle Gass is a guitar god, and Jack Black has incredible range. I love the song Tribute. It's so Zeppelin. Also, The Road and Karate are classics. I don't understand Lee and Explosivo. What's with that? I wish they could tell the stories about the songs first, and have the album a bit longer. Oh well. Bye!
B00004RFCM|4.0|At last! After one failed mariage, a dozen bad relationships and countless ineffectual dates I have been afforded the age old secret that for so long alluded me. Yes, I TRULY NOW KNOW WHAT WOMEN WANT!! And all it took was to watch \\" Sex in the City - The First Season \\" to grant me this incredible knowledge. Imagine the heartbreak, to say nothing of the expense of flowers, I could have saved by catching this HBO series much earlier in life. Well, we live and ( hopefully ) learn! <br />Alright, I'll be the first to confess that the above paragraph, while written tongue-in-cheek, does perhaps hold a hint of truth to it as well. But you'll have to let me explain why. After sitting through both discs of this ( not so ) groundbreaking HBO series I've just a couple of thoughts in mind. The first one being that while I enjoyed the show very much it also left me a vague, somewhat empty feeling inside. Don't misunderstand me, I like watching four attractive female leads ( and heaven forbid they shouldn't be attractive! ) in a cosmopolitan setting, with cute apts., cute clothes (and even cuter dates as well! ) but other than a little 'table talk' concerning sex ( and one or two 'steamy' scene's to keep it controversial! ) there was not much dialogue here that I found exactly mesmorizing. For the most part the women featured here, while successful in business, are in constant need of attention and reassurance. Again, while attractive, they simply aren't all that emotionally interesting! Samantha, played by the amazing Kim Cattrall, the one who 'sleeps around' the most, is without a doubt, because of her promiscuity, the most honest woman this show has to offer. While the others, at least in the first season, tend to eat, drink, talk and sleep \\"SEX\\" it is only Samantha who seems confident enough to live life by her own terms instead of merely complaining about the lack of men in their lives....or the lack of life in their men! It's been stated that men tend to think about sex atleast once every twenty seconds....but if this series is any indication, than I suspect these women may actually have 'cornered the market' in that regard. Do female viewer's truly want another show that expounds the age old notion that all women do is whine and complain about men....and the virtues of shopping! Or are the creaters of this series, by writing characters that seem to be in a constant state of crisis concerning the opposite sex, simply pandering to women's worst instincts in attempting to keep viewer's tuned in. <br />I don't doubt for a moment that the issues presented on this show are, at once, important and honest. But unfortunately, by resorting to the same  stereo-types that we've seen countless times before on the screen than I suspect that the 'meat' of these issues are being lost. And, sad to say, in the long run, it may inadvertenly sabotage the very show they've created. Again, it's obviously a very well put together program but , for the most part, it does have all the depth of an issue of Cosmopolitan magazine! Could it be that the producer's of \\" Sex and the City \\" want to have their cake and eat it to? Make no mistake, the creaters of this wonderful show are fully aware of what's marketable to women and it seems they've taken full advantage of their expertise in that area. To sell this program as 'ground-breaking' television by virtue of simply pushing the sex factor only proves how really purient ( to say nothing of being easily titillated! ) we as Americans still are . I guess, even after all these years, \\"SEX\\" really does sell! <br />In the end, while I look forward to the second season ( yes, I know I'm behind already! ) I must admit that I may be watching the series for all the wrong reasons. And while I'm aware that there may be real concerns that are being addressed here I simply find it rather difficult to get past what I consider this 'lipstick vogue' factor that the show relies heavily on in an effort to keep the program trendyand \\" hip \\". I do like \\" Sex and the City \\" and no doubt men can learn some things from this program. But the real issue might just be \\" IS THIS WHAT WOMEN REALLY WANT? \\"
B000002GBD|4.0|This album, along with a lot of bands in the mid 70's, is a good solid hard rock album. Noithing that you wouldn't expect. But it has really good tunes from the boys. The title track is a great motorcycle song, and Miss Misery's is a classic. I like Rose In The Heather, even thouh a lot of people don't. Begges Day is a great cover, and it's got cool leads. the only song I can't stand is Love Hurts. Ugh, a power ballad. However, this makes it up with Please Don't Judas Me. A beatiful song with beatiful music. Check out the tablas. Incredible. It's a good album from 1975, and.. well that's it. Bye!
B00003CXCS|4.0|Really enjoyed This Movie classic,  I only wish it came in full screen
0767835255|1.0|This silly farce may have worked if it had been promoted as satire.  No matter. There was NO excuse for this doozy. <br />Glenn Close as vice president is trying to maintain order after learning Soviet terrorists have hijacked the president's plane with his staff, wife and daughter aboard.  Close's high octane drama was silly.  If you didnt like Hillary, youll hate Glenn.<br />On Air Force One after the hijacker takeover, President Harrison Ford issued some pretty sappy dialogue with his cookie cutter pretty little wife and daughter.  The little girl's dippy words were an embarrassment.  She sounded like a Pollyana Retard telling &quot;daddy&quot; not to worry, all would be all right. Fords insipid marshmallow smile (&quot;Oh, out of the mouths of babes&quot;)in return underscored the absurdity of the scene.  I didnt know whether to laugh or cry.<br />In &quot;Star Wars&quot;, a Sci-Fi fantasy, using gangbuster-type special effects with macho fighter planes piloted by arrogant hot shot captains was acceptable....including exploitation of the audience's jingoistic allegiance to the overdone heros. In &quot;Air Force One&quot; the same approach was insulting.<br />The finale too was insulting....and a joke. This skinny little man, President Harrison Ford, has somehow managed to save everyone else off his doomed airborne presidential plane (I'll let you rent the movie and learn how). Alone now, he has managed to attach himself to a cable between the doomed Air Force One and the attendant savior plane to save himself. This he does but it is not fun watching him blow in the wind in his little gray presidential suit, what..? 15,000 feet up, at 300/500 miles per hour?   I dont know the coordinates.  Ive never had to consider that kind of thing before I saw this movie. <br />Who wrote the script?  Where was the director when the lines were delivered? Where have you gone, Harrison Ford - a seasoned, respected and sober actor, I assumed - that you could sell out for this shallow silliness and then pretend you are a genuine actor? <br />A couple big names, an idiotic script/story line and overdone phony special effects with chauvinistic fighter planes exploding to the rescue to STP (Save the President) do not an intelligent movie make. <br />Watch Air Force One if you want to, but pretend it was meant to be satire only. In other words, avoid at least some of the insult.

0385505833|1.0|&quot;Skipping Christmas&quot; is a most worthwhile idea to consider.  Unfortunately this author treats it shabbily and shallowly.  (I would give this book zero stars but found the program required a choice of 1-5.)  The amount of time, energy, money and anxiety many of us spend each holiday season, without reflecting on the value received for our efforts, is mind-boggling. For adults to expect gifts (as though they were still five years old &amp; believed in Santa Claus) is juvenile, mercenary and ridiculous. Yet how many of us continue this unexamined pretense at celebration.  And others of us play into the practice by excessive shopping, spending, &amp; gifting.<br />Christmas is a lovely religious holiday.  The scriptural history,  music and ritual can be uplifting and almost mystical.  Christmas as a time for small children is especially rich and sweet.  But, Christmas for mature adults without religion and small kids is an expensive, exhausting, silly activity and well worth &quot;skipping.&quot;<br />I hope to find an author who will treat the subject with respect.
B00002MZ4W|4.0|While Fiona's first album was a opus to self loathing and failed relationships, a perfect response to the post-grunge movment of the late 90s. She has out done herself here, going deeper into the heart felt voice that we had begun to love on &quot;tidal&quot; and pulled out a bit of up-beat happiness, just enough to give a sacastic reponse to the critics that down-played her first release. While still not as good as &quot;tidal&quot; she pulls out all of the stops in &quot;When The Pawn...&quot; and gives us a view of the full power of her vocal range, and hope that the pop thats on the radio now , won't last.

B00003CXTF|4.0|For months in advance of my seeing this movie, all I heard was negative this...negative that.  Well, I can tell you one thing, this movie isn't all that bad.  What I find more objectionable are all the armchair critics - many of which have showered us with their &quot;knowledge&quot; of movie making below - who, for whatever reason, have an axe to grind against this movie.  Look, get a grip!  If you wanted a documentary, why are you going to the theater?  That's never been Hollyweird's strength.  The fact is they spin fantasy better than anything else, with occasional references to historical fact.<br />This movie has reasonable tempo, excellent special effects and a very nicely woven story line (if loose with the facts of history).  For those that think the love story is old hat, well all I can say is - if you want an original love story, write it yourself!  The easiest job on the planet is that of the critic, and God knows we're replete with critics.  I liked the way this movie tied together historical events, even if the portrayal of those events wasn't true to form.  Hey, The Longest Day - long considered the definitive D-Day movie is hardly factually accurate.   But, it's still a good movie.  Saving Private Ryan is likewise loose with the facts - but generally speaking - the movie's goal was to convey the sense of what it was like to be there.  It, like Pearl Harbor, ties many smaller stories that occurred on that day in history together so that the movie and it's characters have cohesion.  You can't accomplish that jumping all over the place telling 3000 separate stories that occurred on a single day.   You do it by funneling all of those facinating little stories into a small group of characters and you view &quot;history&quot; from that perspective.  Anyone that expects, or thinks that Hollywood should start spinning out documentaries has a very slippery grip on reality's already frayed rope. <br />If you want the facts, seek out and talk at length with WWIIvets.  Many of those that I've approached are reluctant at first, but when I express my undying gratitude for their tremendous sacrifices, they usually return the favor by sharing bits and pieces of their experience.  Many vets that refused in the past to talk about the horrors of that war are now speaking out - I think to make sure people don't forget how bad things can get - before they all move on to reunite with their fallen comrades.<br />This movie is better than most of the &quot;critics&quot; are telling you.  If you doubt me, go see it, then come back and tell me I'm wrong!
B00005QZ7U|5.0|This movie, while using well-known music and a classic plot line, is thoroughly original, evoking what must have been the spirit of Montmartre bursting away from convention, flaunting itself in colors, noise, music, and unbearable-yet obsessive-romantic and passionate love: a forerunner of the 60s in its rebelliousness against decorum and tradition. The movie's opening with the curtain going up on the stage, the unconventional lighting and camera angles, the amazingly intelligent use of familiar music in a new way, the costumes, choreography, and filming all add up to a really innovative and exciting movie. I think this should win an Oscar as best picture of the year, but Harry Potter or Lord of the Rings will probably win, and while they are excellent movies, they do not have the freshness and sauciness this one does.
B000050XEI|3.0|This CD is comforting and easy to listen to.  I enjoy listening to it.
B00003CY5J|5.0|This is a nicely crafted caper flick with a talented cast and a well conceived story.  The heist genre has been heavily sown over the years, so it is difficult to come up with a truly fresh storyline.  Still, there have been so many bad heist films that to see one of this caliber is a treat.  <br />Robert DeNiro plays Nick, a thief who wants to do one big job to get out of the business.  Marlon Brando is Max, the fence who brings Nick together with Jack (Edward Norton), the inside man who conceived the job.  This standard setup is far from original and is a staple of this type of film.  What makes it excel is the way it unfolds.  Director Frank Oz, steps out from his outstanding career with the Muppets to take on a completely different type of project, performing quite admirably.  Oz unwinds the tale deliberately, taking time to develop relationships and motivations usually missing from heist flicks.  The result is an extremely believable yarn with characters whose behavior is consistent with motivations revealed throughout the film.<br />The story, which is a collaborative effort by four writers of little renown, is very tight.  They do a good job of creating a story that evolves effectively, adapting ingeniously to each little wrinkle they introduce.  While the probability of a double cross is pretty transparent, the ending twists a couple of times, first giving the viewer what he has been set up to expect and then delivering the unexpected.  That is good storytelling.<br />The acting is uniformly good from a cast of accomplished actors.  DeNiro doesn't break any new ground with this character, but Nick is so familiar to him that he can't help but deliver a terrific portrayal.  This may not be a career performance for DeNiro, but there are few actors I can think of who could have played this character any better.  Marlon Brando is a legend, of course, but he has not done anything of consequence since \\"Apocalypse Now\\" (1979).  Even that was a kind of grotesquely twisted character that came nowhere near some of his great performances starting with \\"A Streetcar Named Desire\\" (1951) through \\"Godfather\\" (1972).  This is the first film I have seen him in since 1979 that shows a glimmer of his true acting ability.  Though it is a small role, Brando interprets the character with subtle undertones and a raw power that we haven't seen from him in many years.<br />The new kid on the block (by comparison), but no less talented is Edward Norton.  I have been impressed by Norton's audacious style with each new film he has made.  Once again he adds to his range with this film, delivering a fantastic imitation of a palsied man as a cover for his inside work.  However, this is only a footnote to an otherwise powerful performance.  He conjures a seething arrogance and cunning resolve in a character determined to show the old timers how he is really the best and smartest of them all.  This is a fine addition to a growing resume of Norton's exceptional performances.<br />Though Angela Bassett's character is really superfluous, I must give her credit for an excellent job.  Bassett infuses great emotion and sincerity into a character that is little more than a motivational point of reference for Nick's behavior.  Still, she plays every scene flat out, making the most of a limited opportunity.<br />I was very impressed with this film on a number of levels.  I rated it a 9/10 on the strength of how it compares with the genre.  Even taken in a broader context, I would give it a 7/10 or 8/10 because it is such good filmmaking.  Though a bit slow for the action junkie, it is an engaging film with plenty of entertainment value.
0060254920|5.0|Max is a mischievous boy and gets sent to bed without his supper. A forest grows in his room, and his wild rumpus continues in the forest and out to sea. Max lands on an island where the wild things live. But they aren't really scary. Sendak's illustrations are fantastic.  I love them more now than I did as a child. Max leads the wild things in a wild rumpus - there's howling and dancing and swinging in the trees.  But all this excitement makes Max hungry and he misses his home. Max decides to leave and sails back to his room where his mother has left him his supper, and it is still hot. If you've read it before then read it now to your child. Don't miss this one!
B00005QCYD|1.0|I used to think part II was lame but this takes the cake. A stupid scenario where anyone with a gun dies ten minutes after landing on the island. Poor acting and plot line lead to obvious &quot;I've seen this before..&quot; comments.
B00004U8P9|5.0|I cannot even tell you what I really think.  I am so glad my kids will not be \\"virgins\\" when they are lucky enough to see this in a theatre, but will that even happen in their lifetime?  We have NO PLACE out here to watch it.<br />I love the options it includes, and especially love the price.  Buy only one other thing on Amazon.com and you will not even have to worry about it costing more than a store (this is including shipping and handling).<br />Go on... do it!
B00004Z459|5.0|The songs were absolutely amazing, with cool lyrics and (in my opinion as a girl) hot vocals.  This is a definite must-have cd.  Buy it and enjoy it.  It's pretty cool.
B00000JZIK|5.0|From the very start, there's something very big building up. You want to know who this Kaiser Soze is, since his name comes up as the most notorious criminal around. Verbal Kent (Spacey) narrates to a police officer on what he knew about certain events he might have been involved in. It all ends up with one big ass surprise. An amazing twist to it. There's plenty to laugh at, as well as wait for in this movie. Lots of suspense, action and mystery- enough to make you watch it again, and again.
B000002P72|5.0|Great recordings are often overlooked. Amazon's Review section helps pinpoint spectacular recordings and I agree wholeheartedly with the Amazon.com Essential Recording and Grove Press Guide to CD, commentaries. My personal and private collection of music, really leans towards live recordings. Studio massaging can make anyone sound good, even after the 50th take. This is the real deal. BB King's blues organization hit the Regal, with all the power and spirit of a locomotive. The horn section, alone -deserves credit here. BB's comments to the audience, shows the man himself. King commented about his stuttering lispe in his biography, and how he tried to correct it in later years. In this recording we can hear the artist stammer away-full of emotion, without any reserve. The nerves of the artist are raw, yet the sound which comes forth is pure music and self expression. Listening to Sweet Little Angel and It's My Own Fault-takes the listener back in time, to when the Thrill was Not Gone. His Guitar is like a gospel choir flirting with a brothel. Praying and cursing, as Santana, once said about guitar solos- with great feeling. Not just-doe, rae, me, fa, so, la, te, doe or a cold, major scale.<BR>BB's superb vocals-on this magical nite, inspired rhythm section, relaxed ad libs, ignited an audience in 1964, and we are fortunate to have it on CD. Another recording on CD, \\"Completely Well\\", with bassist Jerry Jermott, a studio recording, is at the same level of virtuosity- showing BB King's power and energy. The man is a treasure and this recording-has everything going for it-for critical musician listening as well as those who simply appreciate heart felt- blues, jazz, vocal or soul, music.
B00003CXN4|2.0|There are no characters worthy of our sympathy except the daughter.  The script was lacking and had no real punch, just sordid tales of how people allow drugs to mess up their lives.  This is a trit star vehicle and little more.<br />The movie is about three different drug stories that are somewhat linked to each other.  The first is about the Federal Drug Czar and his career track ambition blinding him to both the futility of eradicating the harm illegal drugs cause in America, and to the boredom that leads his teenage daughter to prostitution to support her drug habit.  The scenes in which the father looks for his daughter require a major suspension in belief.  No one, especially a bureaucrat would troll the &quot;mean streets as were expected to believe he does.<br />The second story, filmed sufficiently differently to remind us were now watching new characters, involves a drug dealer and his wife that was unaware of her husband's business until a snitch makes a deal and the husband is arrested.  Then were expected to believe that the pregnant wife wants to become part of the drug trade so that she can maintain her lifestyle.<br />Lastly there is the story of the drug trade south of the border in Tijuana.  This is shot with another color filter and in subtitles.  This is the best story in that it is much more likely and realistically done.  The Mexicans see all US governmental agencies involved in drug interdiction as tres letras or Three Letters as in DEA, FBI, CIA etc.  Theyre all seen as equally ineffective.<br />The acting is generally good except for Michael Douglas.  The movie is stylistic which makes it nice eye candy but otherwise it is insubstantial.  We do not come away from this movie having learned anything whether of benefit or not.  I saw nothing of groundbreaking note here.  Its a sad commentary when one finds oneself more interested in picking out the cameo actors than paying attention to the storyline.<br />If you have to see the movie, borrow it from a friend.  Don't spend money on it.  It's long and generally boring.  It won't stay with you.o see the movie, borrow it from a friend.  Don't spend money on it.  It's long and generally boring.

B00005OWIU|5.0|The music to the HARRY POTTER AND THE SORCERER'S STONE film is absolutely stunning and very enchanting. Mr John Williams has done it again! He's impressed me with scores from films like STAR WARS, HOOK, and JURASSIC PARK. And now here's another winning score from John Williams! Listening to this soundtrack will make you want to go and see the film--or experience the magic of the film again, if you've already seen it. I loved all the tracks on this CD, because the score is simply magical. I cannot describe in words how wonderful the music to the HARRY POTTER film is. It is very original, but much like the typical John Williams music. Still, it captures your heart and soul when you listen to it. There's no way you can deny the power of the music. I am definitely planning on buying this soundtrack because I haven't yet. This goes on my list of being one of the top three movie soundtracks of the year! Well done, John Williams.

B00003CXXJ|3.0|SHREK obviously has received a lot of praise from movie critics and audiences world-wide. Well, I decided to rent this DVD to see what all the fuss was about since I didn't go and see it in theaters. I have to say that as hilarious as it is, SHREK was not the best film I've ever seen. I have to say that I enjoyed exploring all the special features more than the movie itself! The DVD is quite excellent and a good treat to all fans of DVDs. The computer animation of the film is pretty well-done, too (though I tend not to like computer animation and prefer the regular cartoon drawing animation). And the voice performances are one of the best parts of the film!<br />SHREK stars Mike Myers as the voice of Shrek--a giant, friendly ogre, Eddie Murphy as the voice of Donkey--Shrek's sidekick who is obviously a donkey, Cameron Diaz as the voice of Princess Fiona--who's not like any normal princess and does not act like a princess, and John Lithgow as the voice of Lord Farquaad--the evil lord who has proved all fairy tales politically incorrect. SHREK basically spoofs all Disney animated movies, but it does it in a way which young children can enjoy and not in a gross way like what SCARY MOVIE did to teen horror movies.<br />But the movie is not the best part--the special features on this DVD is the best part! On this DVD, you can go behind-the-scenes to the world of Shrek. You can play games, read fake biographies and listen to fake interviews with the main characters, and a lot more. If you loved the movie SHREK, than this DVD is highly recommended. But if you just love good DVDs and need more good DVDs for your collection, then buy this DVD for the special features! It is a good DVD and good movie.

B00005OM4N|3.0|Britney's new album is just a tad bit old.. Okay I have agreed with people before, but this is where I have to draw the line.. Despite the first single &quot;I'm A Slave 4 U&quot;, the rest of the album goes back in time to &quot;Baby One More Time&quot; and &quot;Oops I Did It Again&quot;. Maybe it's the old cliche of the Max Martin/Rami production team.  Not to put down their work, I am sure they are talented and they have come out with some good songs, but the style is becoming boring.  Anyone on the planet can identify that same beat just by a few listens.  I do take my hat off to them on &quot;Not A Girl, Not Yet A Woman&quot;.  It is probably the only song on the album I can stand listening to, and that's not saying much.  &quot;Bombastic Love&quot; is nerve cringing! It is just awful. This goes back to the likes of &quot;Soda Pop&quot;.  Another throw away track that somehow made it onto the album.  A Majority of the album is up tempo and bouncy.  The cover version of Joan Jett's classic hit, was poorly done.  For the simple reason, Britney just does not have the vocal grit to pull it off.  This styling is completely foreign to the teen-pop diva.  She'd do better constantly singing something along the lines of &quot;Baby Baby oh Baby Baby&quot;...  Although not a devastating album (I have seen my share of those), it just isn't impressive enough in my humble opinion to be anything more of a success than her previous work.

B00005V1Z0|4.0|I thought that Tomb Raider was pretty good because I'm into all that action and adventure stuff, but it may not have been a male flict a lot.  I couple guys that saw it before me said that it wasn't that good.  I thought it was well developed even though there was a blooper in there; the lady at the door had 1 towel in the first scene, but in the next shot of her, had 2 towels.  I got the impression during the entire movie that maybe Alex and Lara were ex-lovers, or something, and that Alex was in love with Lara and she may have loved him too.  There were just several things that gave me that impression.  I also thought that Alex was pretty cute.  I thought that it was kind of touching about what she did and how she reacted to things that were about her father or that she needed to do to finish her father's mission.  I wish there were more boobie traps or messes she got into that maybe she needed help with.  The movie seemed to be real, or based on real myths, and the caves and stuff looked real too.  I did think that it wasn't made out all that well like it sounded like it would be, but it was still pretty good.  I hope they make a second one with a bit more action, traps, and dangers, also I hope they show if Lara and Alex get together or whatnot.  I hope they do get together, they made a good pair, and with both of there smarts, they would be pretty much unstopable in tomb raiding.  There were some parts that were kind of funny if you thought about it, or knew what it meant.  If they do make a second one, I hope that the same actors and actresses are in there.  They did a good job at their rolls, I think.  This movie was well developed and written.
B00005JKES|5.0|...this is a great set of DVDs. The episodes are crystal clear, and the script notes add to the package by tying up some loose ends (what was the deal with those Flesh World magazines anyway? You'll find out in the script notes). I had forgotten how much I had truly truly enjoyed these episodes until I went off on a Twin Peaks jag yesterday and watched them all.<br />As for not having the pilot, I do have the video tape of the movie made from the pilot, with the tacked on ending. If you stop watching that when you see Andy playing the trumpet to Lucy, then you've seen the pilot.
B00005JKQX|5.0|This is a truly touching film. If you are not familiar with the story I will only say that to give away any details of this movie would be inappropriate. A BEAUTIFUL MIND is slow, lethargic yet remains intriguing and emerges into a heartfelt statement about our true selves and the meaning of love, commitment and the essence of mind and being. Russell Crowe and Jennifer Connelly give brilliantly realistic performances and make this film work. A lot also has to be said of James Horner's insightful and moving score, which only enhances the viewer's insight and response to the film's statement.  This film is beautiful and one of the best to come out this year.
B000059TPI|5.0|This is the best movie ever. It is so funny! The six foot tall invisible bunny added to the laughs, and it was especially funny to watch James Stewart react to the bunnny, who nobody else could see.
B00000CQJZ|1.0|I cannot agree with most of the reviewers, here, about the movie itself. It's not that I dislike old movies; I'm actually a huge fan of movies from this era and of Hitchcock's later films. But, this particular movie has little to recommend it, in terms of entertainment value.<br />You can, at times, see shades of the greatness to come in Hitchcock's direction, but he hadn't reached anywhere near his peak, at this point. I found the acting to be stilted, wooden, and caricaturish; the pacing alternately inappropriately frantic and unforgivably plodding. <br />Judging from the reviews that specify the version, the Criterion Collection edition is quite a good transfer. Unfortunately, the Laserlight Video version is a waste of plastic; dreadful audio, grainy, alternately washed out and too dark, splices, skips, etc. It's the version currently selling for [$$], and isn't worth even that paltry sum.<br />Students of Hitchcock, buy the Criterion Collection edition, if you must own this film. Fans of Hitchcock, rent the Criterion edition, if you wish to satisfy your curiousity. Everyone, avoid the Laserlight Video edition, at all costs!

6304913176|4.0|Having now seen the movie read the original Novel and the Graphic novel. (all 3 are different)   I felt the  movie while obviously taking creative license by changing and omitting many things. Was An excellent effort.  Obviously a popcorn movie Starship Troopers(ST) was a fun ride.   The Best person in the film was Michael Ironside as the roughnecks LT. THe movie which follows Johnny Rico's entrance in to the Moble Infantry(MI) first to impress his girlfriend second to rebel against his parents. Johnny finds friends, hardships and heartache as he fights his way thru the film. Denise Richards as Carmen Ibanez as the love of rico's life rides thru the film with a stepford wife grin on her even when nearly dying a few times.  If you read the book you may not recognize anything. and vice versa.<BR>if you need a good ride or good popcorn movie then see it.

This book is full of fact, gossip and inside views of a sub-culture most of us will never experience, yet sit just on the outskirts of, on the other side of those swinging kitchen doors.  It touches us, but we cannot touch back.

He speaks of sex in the storage rooms, backseat negotiations over bread delivery with shady businessmen (presumably mafia), ego-induced insanity and down-and-out genius.<br />He gives us some food for thought, lets us in on the odd sense of humor shared in most of the kitchens he has worked in, and occasionally shocks us with things we may not have wanted to know, but we read on, swallowing every juicy tidbit hungrily.

B00003CY0V|2.0|The clashing between antitrust worlds, one man (Hugh Jackman) seeking his daughter back by doing evil, and one (John Travolta) seeking to protect the United States by sacrificing the whole U.S. if necessary, and dragging behind is Halle Berry, with a side dish of star, Don Cheadle who is out to eliminate cyber-terrorists.<br />This is a confused, but simple premise conceived by Producer, Joel Silver, and put into action by Director, Dominic Sena.  What is driving this film?  ...Possibly just the password: Swordfish.  It unlocks the key to some of the most deadly people in the world, and holds tight the secrets of what our government doesn't want us to get our hands on: LOTS OF MONEY.  The story of this film completely turns around what our country is built on.  John Travolta knows all the secrets of our world, but he needs a code-cracker, a man on the side.  Because Hugh Jackman is a master of computer networking disaster, John Travolta recruits him onto his jacket of bull rags, in exchange for $10 Million and Jackman also gets his daughter back, who was taken from him by his ex-wife.  Hugh is the true star of the film.  What drives him is his love for his daughter.  What drives Travolta is his need of dominate power over the world (and that moronic beard of his).  What divides these characters is Halle Berry, who's one particular scene (when you see it you'll know what I mean) is basically the reasoning for her character even in the film at all.  She pretends as though she likes both Hugh and John.  You never really know who she's really working for because she is a side changing woman (or just playing hard to get).  Her life is a web of conspiracy spread over both of these characters, but you never really figure her out until the end.  I'm not sure if Don Cheadle makes a big difference in the film or not.  He plays an investigator who is out to put an end to the malevolent hackers.  Yet, if you remove him from the film, nothing is really missing.  His filming probably wrapped up in a day or two because his chracter doesn't hold much ground.  He's really not a supporting character, he's just there.<br />One thing I've heard about this film is the explosions.  I don't know why critics are making remarks about them.  There is only one that stands out in the film, which takes place in the very beginning.  It's filmed in a very futuristic, slow-moving process focusing on oozy washes of flames, breaking glass and flying people.  (It's a little hard to express in words.)  I expected the film to have a lot of explosions, but the only real one, in the opening sequence was far too different and strange, especially for what I was thinking it was going to be.<br />Another action scene features Hugh Jackman and John Travolta in their beautiful car, speeding away from the mayor's agents.  Travolta pulls out his powerful assault rifle and blows them all away.  It is very fast and fun, somewhat original, far from realistic, but still enjoyable.<br />The only other rock-em-sock-em action is featured in the end of the movie where we pick up from what happens in the beginning.  A terrorized bus, led by Travolta, is lifted by helicopter when the police swarm the area and a city skyscraper is smashed on the face, leaving a big hole on one region of the building.  It is very good, and amazingly original.  I only question whether or not a helicopter could support a bus and the busload of people on it.<br />What this film does not build on is the characters.  It has an interesting plot, but it could possibly be hard to conceive.  It just takes a little of computer hacker scandal, then drops it with the &quot;little-less&quot; than standard action technique.  Joel Silver repeats his mistakes that he made with Exit Wounds.  The action wasn't as furious as I would've hoped it to be.  It has some originality in action scenes, but it doesn't have enough.  I still question the point of the film, and many of the plot pieces.<br />I'm still caught betweenthe good and evil of the film.  However this film may have tried to present itself, it still is a low standard action film with some originality in dramatic sequences that is meant to cover up what really lurks beneath.  Travolta is still just a villain, even if his facial hair is strange.  Hugh Jackman is just a good guy who tries to live a simple life by temporarily helping out the bad guys for money.  Halle Berry is just a tag along who's only point for the movie is to have a topless scene so more male viewers are attracted to the picture.  And Don Cheadle is that same old let loose investigator who is determined to stop the bad guys, who is unaware that the good guy on the bad side is an ally.  So in reality, there is nothing new here, and it just makes a confusing plot so techno that it tries to cover up what it really is.  It might work for some, but I get what it's all about.  The title of the film, and the password in the movie are both about the same thing.  SWORDFISH = MONEY, and there isn't much anything else to it.<br />QUOTE: &quot;There is some new scale scenes, and brief action sequences to feast on, but that is only &quot;brief&quot;.  Otherwise we have a nonshalance plot consisting of the everyday standard action film characters that still haven't changed in over one-hundred years.  The film promotes itself with Halle Berry without a shirt on, and an opening explosion.  John Travolta fails again, Hugh Jackman does well, Halle Berry loses her shirt, Don Cheadle yells and rolls down a hill, Dominic Sena's respect takes a downfall, and Producer Joel Silver keeps making the same action movie over and over and over.  So what is the point of a film manipulating the United States' honor and presenting itself as boringly overdone and repeated?  Swordfish has some action scenes and a worthy performance from Hugh Jackman, but nothing else comes to bare.  So why should the audience even care?&quot;
B00005QIPH|5.0|OK, so maybe one song (the Modern Age) sounds like the Velvets, and to me it's more of an homage than imitation.  The hook on the Modern Age actually doesn't sound a bit like VU and it's the part that slays me.  Television?  That's a ludicrous comparison.  I can't think of anything on ITI that sounds like Television.  If Julian Casablancas resembles anyone it's Stooge era Iggy, but that was Detroit.  If anything, the Strokes first album reminds me a bit of the Feelies, who were from New York if I recall correctly.  Same herky jerky rhythms, semi spastic guitars.  It all gels together wonderfully, combined with some of the best hooks I've ever heard assembled in one place.  I actually think the songs are pretty complex, listen to the guitar interplay and song structures, not to mention the surprise melodic changes, etc.  <br />I put off getting this album for a couple months because I was cynical about all the hype, but in this case it's deserved.  I just hope they stay together to make another album.  I'm just upset I didn't go see any of their Seattle shows this year.
B00003CXZ1|2.0|Tomb Raider is a film more popular than most action vehicle films simply because the heroine is the lead character, a difference that began changing much in Hollywood within the year 2000.  Think Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon; Erin Brockovich; Tomb Raider, and so on.  This techno-thriller from Con Air's Simon West, is based upon the power packed Tomb Raider video game.  We've seen a few of these types of movies as well- such as Final Fantasy: The Spirits Within and Mortal Kombat.  <br />Angelina Jolie plays Croft who is on a mission to find half of a missing triangle, in which if joined together, could alter the course of time and reality, where people can then easily play God.  Croft's one hope is to see her father again.  And if she can accomplish her mission before the allignment of the planets, she will then save the entire universe, and possibly see her late father once more.<br />This is a summer film, in which expectations are expected to drop simply because these movies are the ones to sit back and enjoy.  There should be no thinking process to it, and if you miss a half hour of it in the middle somewhere, you should easily be able to sit back down and put together what happened.  Lara Croft is an interesting character.  She is like a James Bond-Jet Li combination.  She's rugged, hard as rock, and as charming as anything.  Angelina Jolie fits her character the best of anyone I'd say.  Her performance and action stunts are dynamite.  But where she is excellent, she basically stands alone.  The plot is basically a Double Dragon theme.  Put the two pieces of rock together and save the universe.  Well, I was just sickened with the plot because I've seen it, seen it, and seen it many times after.  The villains are dreadful, and not even as good as the ones who ramble off their mouths telling the hero their secret plan to &quot;win&quot; (in their case).  These guys don't even say anything amusing.  They look like archelogist cowboys of some sort, who fire smallpistols and a few artillary machine guns at Lara who is running across a wall attached to a cable.  For one thing- none of them hit her, and none of them have much of a point to shoot her at all.  What I'm saying is that if they want to kill her, why don't they try aiming for her?<br />However, I was immediately pulled into the film in the very beginning, which comes off as George Lucas: &quot;Star Wars&quot; style entertainment.  We are instantly pulled into the world of Croft battling some cybernetic prototype machine that her robotics expert built for her for practice.  At first we are unaware of this cyborg as to whether she's on a mission and it's a villainous computer controlled machine, or whether it's a cyborg with a mind of its own, something like in the film: Virus.  Jolie has some incredible stunts, and there are many tremendous action sequences, but the further we get into the film, the more the adventure dies out, and the special effects somewhat die down.  This film counts more on Jolie's sensuality rather than the action adventure the audience is expecting.  (Her shower scene in particular)  That isn't what draws the game's audience, so why should the movie rely on that formula?  However the film might portray what its audience is looking for, Jolie is an excellent Lara Croft.  Jon Voight, Jolie's real father, plays her father in this film as well.  His character is more-or-less not quite what I was picturing for his ideal persona.  I don't see much of a bond between Lara and him.  He wasn't bad, it was just sort of an odd placement.<br />I guess I will say that I give this film credibility for Angelina's performance, the action sequences and super-charged stunt working, but I don't understand the means of what the film has left over.  The villains are more like alcoholic leprachauns.  The plot copies a low budget Double Dragon or martial arts feature.  The ending plays out as obvious as it could possibly have been.  The sub-plot of Lara and her father was very much expected and unwanted.  The film also takes advantage of the audience and Angelina, in which the film basically targets boys who want to see some of Jolie's showered down flesh.  And there are so many film ingredients that make up this movie to fit.  So of course, this is what summer is all about when movies come around.  I wanted to sit back and enjoy this movie, I really did.  But as the movie kept on going, my interest just kept on slipping away.<br />QUOTE: &quot;Angelina Jolie's performance is great, and so is the action we are provided with.  But this film is all about getting that shower scene of Jolie in.  It seems as though this film is meant for teasing teenage boys, and not presenting action entertainment.  The special effects are passable, the plot is completely a low budget copy of previous alternate-dimension, time warping martial arts films, the villains are lower than typical, and the film stars going rotten after the first forty minutes.  So I ask you- would you rather play the game as Lara and make up the fun as you go along, or watch a movie that you cannot make interesting enough?&quot;
0471413909|4.0|Overall I liked this book. It is easy to read and contains some solid nutritional facts.  However, on page 21 and 22 it seems to contradict itself big time.  On Page 21 it shows the protein content of the plan to range from 19-35%.  However, following this analysis of the diet he says it is not necessary to count calories, but if you did that one would find 55% of the calories on the Paleo diet come from protein.  I would dearly love to know if I have misinterpreted something here or that there is a misprint or something.  Too much of a discrepancy for me.  Maybe the publisher could clear this up. Is the protein 19%, 35% or is it indeed as much as 55%.  <br />In any case the diet itself is simple, easy to follow  and well laid out, however, one may just have to calculate the protein content for oneself.  Personally I like to know the analysis of any diet that I am trying.

B00005QK3W|3.0|Rating Paul McCartney albums is not easy, perhaps because of his writing style or recording style at any given moment (which thankfully changes more per album than just about anyone else).  For 'Rain', we see Paul combining the spontaneous energy of 'Run Devil Run' with the digital DJing of David Kahne.  The result?  Ehhh, it's okay.  Certainly Paul's voice is far improved from the mannered deliveries of 'Press to Play' and 'Off the Ground' - and his playing is wildly inventive.  However, his first CD since his wife's passing seems to suggest that if you shrug any tragedy off, you can be driving around with a chickie half your age in no time flat.  Obviously, this could not have been the case in real life, but Paul's steadfast 'all I need is love' stance proves only to make him come off as shallow.  There are hints to the contrary (&quot;what I've been going through/I wouldn't wish it on a soul, much less on you&quot;) but they are only hints.  If it is perceived as a shame that Britney Spears and Garth Brooks kick Macca's butt, saleswise, it could only be because those artists seem to make an effort to connect with their audience on a personal level.  The production on 'Rain' is fairly inventive, although it comes from Kahne's inspiration, not McCartney's.  This CD has the professionalism and feckless charm of 'At the Speed of Sound', only without the hits.
0060931671|5.0|I've read all of Pynchon's works, and while I can't say that Crying of Lot 49 is his best, or his most complex, it is certainly his most accessible.  If you want to get into Pynchon, this is definitely the place to start.  This book has all of the wacky conspiracy theory that you'll get in V and Gravity's Rainbow, but it doesn't require all of the background knowledge that you really need to get anything out of it.  Pynchon tends to show off how much research he has done by throwing all sorts of obscure facts and references at you, but he keeps that to a minimum here.  In addition, it isn't anywhere near as long as some of this other works, so you can get a good feel for the author without having to commit several months of reading.<br />If you are a fan of conspiracies in general, or you are looking for a great weird book that will challenge your perception of reality without causing you to bang you head against the wall in frustration, you can't beat this book.
B000000H6D|5.0|Recent debates about the relevance or pertinence of &quot;rock&quot; these days are somewhat quelled - no, let's say smashed - by discs such as this. Typo O Negative has an uncanny ability to take disparate forms of music (not uncommon for bands these days) and successfully merge them into something quite powerful (very uncommon these days).<br />Yes, so-called Goth/Dark Rock bands usually grow tiresome with their penchant for now cliched themes of revelling in morbid musings on death and the apparent meaninglessness and frustration of life. But hey, at least this band does it with a smirk on its face and some pretty nifty melodies. When this dude starts singing and the harmonies kick in, it's pretty damn entertaining.<br />Makes me sort of want to dress completely in black and go outside on an intensely raining day.
0060229357|5.0|My son will sit and listen to any book, but this is the first one I remember him asking me to read over and over again.  The first time we read it, we laughed as Harold made an all pie picnic.  Great book!

B000003TAW|5.0|Weezer is one of the greatest bands out there and they proved it with their debut self-titled albumn. This is an awesome C.D. It is a record where you don't skip a track. Rivers Cuomo writes spectatular songs and has a good voice. Matt Sharp did awesome on bass and so did Brian Bell on guitar. The best song on this record is probably Say It Ain't So. It has an awesome opening guitar and the words are just great. The thing about Weezer is that their songs are words that many people could relate to. This is an awesome C.D. Another good songs is Buddy Holly. It is a great song with a Happy Days anthem. Undone - The Sweater Song is also a good song with a humorous side. Rivers Cuomo is very good at bringing laughter to his listeners. I highly reccomend this C.D. for you to purchase. WEEZER!
B000002UKS|5.0|Foo Fighters headman Dave Grohl has his roots in Nirvana, and it certainly shows on this album. Indeed, the hard punk sound, heavy guitars, and pop sensibility that made Nirvana so remarkable highlight this Foo Fighter's album as well, though this album is notably more upbeat than anything Nirvana ever created. Grohl and his band lash through each track, assaulting your ears with a barrage of intoxicating punk energy. Yet there is time for more subdued moments, such as fun, groovy little track &quot;See You&quot; and the moving, emotional &quot;February Stars.&quot; This is the first Foo Fighters album I bought, and I can honestly say it knocked me off my feet. Its sheer energy and tight sound make it an rip-roaring, rollercoaster ride experience each time you listen to it, and it just gets better with each listening. One of the true gems of the '90s.

B00004Z311|5.0|Add me to the list of those waiting for the DVD but I question the differences in the two versions.<BR>While I would love to see all that was cut from the film, I have heard both scores and I prefer Tangerine Dream's.  Now of course, I have only heard Goldsmith's - not seen it with the film - but Tangerine Dream's adds such a beautifully dark aura to the story that might otherwise have come off as too &quot;light&quot;.<BR>I could be wrong but at this point I admit my love for the film is based on the original American release.  Even with all the edits that may have been noticeable, it was sumptuous viewing and I could not wait to get the soundtrack.
B00005A46T|3.0|Bottom line, this album is not nearly as good as the last one, but it's still worth a listen for fans of this type of music.  Production-wise, this album was certainly done much better, but that's to be expected from a band that has been thrust into the spotlight like these guys.  I found this one to be a lot less melodic (yes, it's possible w/ this type of music).  Vocals were more monotonous and not as catchy.  And for god's sake, one of the catchier &quot;sounding&quot; choruses on the album, &quot;If you're 555 then I'm 666&quot;, leaves me wondering which retarded devil came up with the lyrics.
0385505833|4.0|This book is an easy read and very lighthearted, yet the message is quite clear - the true meaning of Christmas (albeit the non-religious one) is about giving and how generous and unpredictable the human spirit can be in times of need. I can definitely see this book becoming a made-for-tv holiday favorite. It's light and fun to read, and it has a very touching ending that will surpise you.
B00003CXRP|5.0|A work-alcoholic's life is changed when as the lone survivor of a plane crash, he is cast  adrift  on a remote island.  Tom Hanks performance as this latter- day Robinson Crusoe is remarkable.  Helen Hunt,  as the bereaved finacee who finally weds another man is heart-breaking.  The film is based on a true experience.  Well worth seeing.
B00005NP04|5.0|I have been waiting for this for the past 3 years, ever since martina did the tour with Mark Wills (better than the album) but seriously, I love this album, I love martina and you will too, the CD features all of her top songs, you know, the ones you already know &quot;Wild Angels&quot;, &quot;Safe in the Arms of Love&quot;, and &quot;Love's the Only House&quot; plus her new hit &quot;Blessed&quot;, a sure hit, you can't go wrong with over 65 minutes of Pure Martina, stick it in your Car and go road trip or just listen at home, but get this CD, you won't be sorry you did.  Its well worth the wait for her first ever greatest hits album.
1587990717|5.0|A treatise on critical thinking that validates the continued existence of those that do not suffer fools, lightly.<br />You have to be smart to enjoy this book.
6302759110|5.0|This is a very, very, strange film, that gets a very questionable five from this wide-eyed viewer. It isn't really scary, and is not near as good as &quot;Interview of the Vampire,&quot; but it's unconventional storyline, excellent acting, and weird and gothic sets of which the like have not been seen since &quot;Batman Returns&quot; are all high points in the film. I say for sure though, &quot;DRACULA&quot; IS NOT A FILM FOR EVERYONE (especially not for the kiddies), and still, I'm not sure it was a film for me.
B00003CXDZ|5.0|Who would of thought that you could pull of a remix combining Lady Marmalade with the classic Nirvana song, Smells like Teen Spirit?  I thought that was just one of the many amazing tricks that this movie actually pulled off brilliantly.  It left me stunned.  The singing in the movie is amazing, with Nichole Kidman and Ewan McGregor's real voices, which blended together perfectly.  I really respected Kidman and McGregor for using their real voices, which I thought were surprisingly 'spectacular spectacular'.  And on top of that their acting really pulled this movie off.  Kidman was hilarious in the misunderstanding of the poetry scene, and McGregor was a perfect shy, young boy in the scene right before the elephant medley.  All in all, this movie amazed me.  It's the kind you wish you saw more often with all the components; great acting, amazing cinematography, gorgeous sets, intricate costumes, and a romantic but suspenseful plot.
B000059XYK|4.0|Is the remake of &quot;Gone in 60 Seconds&quot; a masterpiece? No. Is it better than the original? Debatable, to say the least. One thing is for sure, this film has been unfairly sliced and diced by blood thirsty critics, and it did not deserve that. &quot;Gone in 60 Seconds&quot; is indeed a very witty, smart, sexy (Angelina Jolie is in it, isn't she?), Buckheimer film. One thing though, like other reviewers here have said, this is a devout car film, and viewers who don't really care much about cars might spend a lot of time during the movie rolling their eyes. But, for all the car lovers out there, at least try renting it, huh?
0345448898|5.0|I'd forgotten that books can be this exhilarating and enjoyable.  Philip Pullman has done some wonderfully imaginative things with the worlds he creates in the His Dark Materials trilogy.  Particularly cool are the armored bears, great intelligent polar bears who craft semi-magical armor for themselves and live in a roughly ordered society.  His conception of daemons as magical creatures that each and every human possesses, that are able to shapeshift until their human partner reaches puberty, is also a stroke of genius.  There were other elements of the books that impressed me deeply, but I won't go into them for fear of ruining a pleasant surprise for anyone who decides to read them.<br />It's been a long time since a book kept me up reading until 4 AM, but these three books all gripped my imagination with such intensity that I plowed through them as quickly as I could.<br />These books were first recommended to me as being on par with the Harry Potter series, but I've found Pullman's work here to be far superior to Rowling's.  It's more richly detailed, more imaginative, more deeply thought-out, is stocked with more interesting and well-realized characters, and is more compelling and entertaining at all turns.  Clearly Pullman was writing for a more mature audience than Rowling, but he still stands head and shoulders higher as a writer and world-maker.<br />If there were any justice in the world, Philip Pullman would also be an insufferably famous multimedia star.
B00003CXN3|3.0|nothing special. it drug on a bit. i like the directing and<BR>acting is great, but the plot was pretty loose, and if i look<BR>hard, i bet i can find some holes.<BR>the music is mediocre at best.<br />the worst part of it all is the way it downplays drugs and<BR>addiction. yes, i agree that drugs are horrible, but the fact<BR>of the matter is, its personal choice, and the government is<BR>blowing absurd amounts of money on stopping drugs. <BR>someone else said it's like a 2 hour &quot;this is your brain on <br />drugs&quot; comericial. exactly. <br />its still a good movie, though, and i suppose it's worth a look-<BR>see. if you're over 16.
0345448898|2.0|I thought this series was wonderful...until I got to the end and was so thoroughly disappointed I would not recommend it to anyone. What a waste of time. The first book was awesome. The second book was even better. The third was a chore getting through. The whole series was so original and inventive it was a great disappointment that he ended it on such a sappy love story. I didn't care at all in the end.
B00005B36H|5.0|Tools most recent album that includes the overplayed hit Schism is a good album regardless of what others say.  See it in concert and you will know what i mean.  This album sheds light on the other side of Tool.  Some people said they sold out.  I must ask to whom.  This album was different from the others in the aspect that Maynards lyrics changed somewhat from blasphemy to another type of intellect.  This album has some mathematical terms both as lyrics and as titles but it in no way is a nerd album.  Maynard himself said that it is about time we differentiate ourselves from our surroundings and intergrate our problems into our lives.  I think this album is great, perhaps not as good as AEnima but a great buy.
B00005LB9O|4.0|I purchased the Invisible Band CD yesterday.  So far, it's just OK.  Maybe it'll grow on me.  I'll just have to wait and see.  The track &quot;Side&quot; is the catchiest tune.  It's the reason I bought the CD in the first place.  My advice would be to listen before you buy.
B00005MG2Y|3.0|The Cd is mixed and recorded very well.  The lack of the so called lead singer, Chester, is what the cd is missing.  The little guy with the funny hair running around saying &quot;i'm about to break&quot; makes me want to turn it off.  Chester needs to sing more on the next album.  Oh, and those two bonus tracks are not unreleased for all the numbskulls that think there going to be on the new album.  Thanks for the time
B00005N915|3.0|The performences are very good but not as good as the big bloody sex scene, it will leave you stuned! It starts out with them dancing to music then they start kissing and lay on the bed. Then you see them having sex with him kissing her near her bare breasts. She has her bare feet wraped around his butt and legs. It starts to get more intense when the blood starts coming. They start to move back and forth harder. Her bare feet jump in the air. Then shows other scenes then comes back. It shows reactions on her face as they are havng sex. Their bare feet touch several times. Finally, she screams because it get to intense and he gets off. Very good Erotic which gets 3 stars.
0385501560|5.0|I read this book in one night and I could not put it down.  Not for everyone, but definitely one to read if you like the nihlistic humor of Fight Club.
B00005LOUS|3.0|It's difficult to transform a classic, twenty-some minute animated film into a full-length movie, but director Ron Howard does a pretty good job with &quot;The Grinch&quot;.  The potent asset of this movie is the casting;  Jim Carrey does an awesome job in his portrayal of &quot;The Grinch&quot;.  I don't know of any other actor who could play this part with such animation and credibility.  Cindy Lou Who, played by Taylor Momsen, is also a definite casting plus.  And Anthony Hopkins is a perfect choice for narrator.  The excellent makeup and set designs also deserves kudos. There are a few downsides to this movie, however:  1) The length - it could have made the same impact if it were 85 mins. rather than 105.  2) At times it is obnoxiously loud. (I found myself lowering the volume often).  3) The story line digresses quite a bit from the original animated version (perhaps embelished to accomodate a 105 minute film?) which tends to divert the attention of real &quot;Grinch&quot; fans.  Overall, the movie is entertaining and appropriate for the entire family. Would I see it again? Yes. Would I buy it? No. I give it 3 stars.
B00000I07P|5.0|Slippery When Wet is perhaps one of the biggest and most famous albums to come out of the 80's. It features without a doubt 3 of the most recognizable songs from that time period in &quot;Livin On A Prayer&quot;, &quot;Wanted Dead or Alive&quot; and &quot;You Give Love A Bad Name&quot;. &quot;Never Say Goodbye&quot; the extremely well done ballad just makes this album even better. For any Bon Jovi fan, or any rock fan for that matter, this album is a definate must!
B000002KHB|5.0|This album opened up a lot of doors, and brought 'riff rocking' to the foreground (along with other albums of the time - Black Sabbath, etc - and eventually led to mass acceptance of bands like Kiss and Boston later on).  There is one special thing about 'Machine Head' that I love above all the hard rock albums/CD's I own - it really had STYLE.  Yep, it had the 'song that all wannabe hard rock guitar players knew how to play', however there were a lot of tracks that showed the bluesy, jamming side of Deep Purple.  <br />This was one band that took a lot of smacks from the critics, for no real reason other than they (the critics) HATED what they thought music might 'become' - something 'less' than they wanted it to, pegging this album as some sort of 'regression' from were 'music was going to' in the early 70's. Boohoo.  This album had energy and feeling, and millions of others felt it!  Hey, anyone who has heard a song with 'riffs' has GOT to hear one of the originals from this gem.  Oh, and by the way, heavy metal is like still very alive and well....<br />As 'nostalgic' as this CD may seem to someone younger than me (less than 42!), you should give it your ear.  For those in 'my generation', I am preaching to the converted.  This was Deep Purple at their prime, and if you like the sound, check out anything from 'Rainbow'...real classic stuff!
B00003CX5P|3.0|The special effects in this movie almost make it worth seeing.  Especially the city-planet of Courasant and Naboo.  I was mostly interested in the story; the introduction of Anakin Skywalker and Queen Amidala.  I really did find the story very interesting, it answered many questions I had about the how the whole thing began.  I did have several problems with the movie, however.  The child actor who played Anakin was TERRIBLE.  I don't understand why he was cast, unless his family knows someone special.  Every scene that he is in makes me cringe.  Ewan McGregor, Liam Neeson and Natalie Portman shine.  People have commented that Natalie Portman was a bit stiff as the Queen, but I believe that is her character.  She is a terrific actress.  Other issues were that the pod race scene was way too long.  It was nothing more than a shameless display of Lucasfilm Ltd.'s special effects talent.  It was boring.  Jar Jar Binks was another source of angst.  His bizarre accent and nonsense speak was distracting and annoying.  Other than that, I enjoyed the movie.  I am more looking forward to Episode II this May.  Hopefully George Lucas will improve upon the mistakes he has made with the Phantom Menace.
B000002J0P|5.0|When Crosby Stills and Nash blasted onto the rock scene in 1969 they were immidiately hailed as a super group and for good reason.  David Crosby had already been known as one of the founding members of the Byrds.  Stephen Stills had been the leader of Buffalo Springfield and Graham Nash had been in the Hollies.  So when their debut was released on May 29 1969 it became an instant chart success.<br />Unlike some supergroups Crosby Stills &amp; Nash had great chemistry from the day they were formed.  They harmonized wonderfully together and wrote some excellent songs throughout their career.<br />Each member contributed some awesome material to this album.  In my opinion there is not a single weak song on this record.  Yes some songs surpass others but there is absolutely no filler on this album.  <br />Stephen Stills has always been my favourite member of this supergroup.  His SUITE:JUDY BLUE EYES is one of my faves and it features some great harmonization.  YOU DON'T HAVE TO CRY has some great acoustic guitar playing by him and HELPLESSLY HOPING is a nice love ballad.  He also wrote 49 BYE-BYES the powerful album closer.  However his most powerful track here has to be WOODEN SHIPS which he co-wrote with Crosby.<br />David Crosby's compositions are very good also.  GUINNEVERE has been considered a throw away to some but if you listen carefully you realize the awesome uses of an acoustic guitar and harmonizing voices.  LONG TIME GONE is a bit of a hippy anthem but I love the singing voice he uses on that song it is so unique and powerful and the chorus is gold.<br />Graham Nash proves he can work with the best of them as his MARRAKESH EXPRESS (a song obviously tied in with hash) is a very fun song.  He also composes the hearty rocking PRE-ROAD DOWNS and performed the prettiest love ballad on the album with LADY OF THE ISLAND another one of his own compositions.<br />The success of Crosby Stills &amp; Nash's debut led to them winning best new artist of that year at thegrammy awards<BR>some of their songs were also featured on the Woodstock movie.  Neil Young would later join the group in 1970.  <br />In conclusion &quot;Crosby Stills &amp; Nash&quot; should be in everybodys cd collection.  Whether you are a young music fan or an older fan, you'll love this.  Heck I'm only fifteen and it is one of my top 10 favourite albums that I have every heard!  Yes folks it is that good!  So if you want wonderful harmony, excellent guitar playing and great songs and just overall good music then may I suggest you do yourself a favour and get this cd!  You will not be disappointed my mom showed me her old LP of it and I immidiately fell in love with it.  So I got the cd and have not stopped listening since the day I got it.  Highly recommended!
6304698658|5.0|In my opinion, this is the very best of the \\"Vacation\\" movies from National Lampoon.  Of course, Chevy Chase and Beverly D'Angelo return as the Griswolds and Randy Quaid is the incorrigible and disgusting Eddie.  This film is a must have in any collection.  You don't see movies where you can laugh out loud throughout the entire thing.  This one is like that.  The Griswolds play host to both sets of inlaws and various other relatives, including a surprise appearance by white-trash paragons Eddie, Katherine, their kids (who are also different in every movie) and their lovely dog, Snots.  Who wouldn't expect everything to go wrong at the Griswold family Christmas?  The only things you don't expect in this mock-up of holiday cheer are the things that happen.  My family watches this movie every Christmas.  If you haven't seen it, you are really missing out.
0140281622|5.0|I've always thought the best measure of art is how it moves someone emotionally. The Grapes of Wrath is a work of art that irradiates such movement. A story set in during the Great Depression in a part of the Great American Dust Bowl, Oklahoma; the humanity of man in utter and total destitution is presented in a very interesting way. It also has a VERY gripping ending. Highly recommended classic.
0060920084|1.0|Bill Bryson's account of his journey through America leaves much to be desired in terms of wit, creativity, and respect for his subjects.  In &quot;The Lost Continent,&quot; Bryson fails to share any insight on the United States or its citzens, but rather manages to bash both categories in a totally unobjective way that belies his overrated essence.<br />While missing or barely grazing some parts of the country that are essential to its being (Boston, Texas, and Florida are just some of the subjects that are not mentioned), Bryson relates his depressing story of a nation apparently defined only by its dying downtowns and moronic diner waitresses (the dozens of inane conversations with the former that the author relates are each a spectacle of his lack of both creativity and civility.)  In fact, the only region on which he passes high judgment is his home state of Iowa.<br />Furthermore, Bryson's heavy-handed discussion of race relations and his consistent objectification of women seem more appropriate for a book written in 1959, not 1989.<br />Bill Bryson is clearly writing for an audience that already disdains America and gets a kick out of his belittling of its residents.  This book is worth reading only to further one's understanding of why ex-patriates should remain that way.
B00003CY0V|1.0|... as in, I wonder why this was produced. Left me with a couple of unsavory images burned into my brain. A complete waste of time!
0553583182|1.0|He hooked me with the first few chapters but the more I read the more I got upset. He blames all lifes ailment on negitive thinking so if you were hit by a bus for example you must not have good thoughts in your subconscience. if you get cancer or a cold it is your own fault. if you are laid off from work, it is your own fault. if a terorist runs a plane into your building then it is your fault. he concludes that ANYTHING is posible if you wish it so (i.e if you truly believe your bullit proof and put a gun to your head and pull the trigger if will magically bounce off, if you have any doubt then well, you die.) the beauty of this logic is that if something does not go your way for any reason or your prayers are not answered then you must not wanted it bad enough. it is your fault, not his flawed logic. I do believe that the mind and the power of suggestion is powerful but telling my subconscience till i am blue in the face that i can fly will not make it so.
B00005RFAI|4.0|Here's the track-by-track review:<br />1. \\"Missundaztood\\": Starts off moderate hip-hop beat then gets a little guitar weaves into.  I think Pink just wants everyone to know that she's misunderstood because nobody knows the real her.<br />2. \\"Don't Let Me Get Me\\": A personal anthem for a person who's not perfect.  I like the melody and the lyrics of this song.  Favorite line \\"Tired being compared to Britney Spears, she's so pretty, that just ain't me.\\"  (I think this should be the next single.)<br />3. \\"Just Like a Pill\\":  Starts off mid-tempo, kinda sounds like a ballad.  But then turns into like a Mandy Moore-ish song.  It's very interesting.<br />4. \\"Get the Party Started\\": First single off this album.  Very party worthy, very 'head-bouncy'.  Though it kinda tells if Pink goes to a party (because of the Benz, etc.)<br />5. \\"Respect\\": Though this is kind of a rap song, you'll find yourself singing it.  It's about how everybody likes to pick you up and how to respect yourself without guys.<br />6. \\"18 Wheeler\\": I thought this was gonna be like a truckin' song, but it's actually like a rock song.  It's also about how hard someone might treat you so you need to get out of that relationship or just get up from a hard day.<br />7. \\"Family Portrait\\": Sounds something off the \\"Save the Last Dance\\" soundtrack, but it's actually a very thoughtful song written about Pink's family (which could go for any divorce family, not that I know.)<br />8. \\"Misery\\":  Very bluesy; I can picture Pink and Steven Tyler in a lounge club singing in front of like a band or a piano.  It just sounds like that.<br />9. \\"Dear Diary\\": Of course, those of you who watched 'Diary' on MTV, this song was on it.  Though it sounds better on the show, without that weird guitar sound.<br />10. \\"Eventually\\": Very slow and melodic, but it still has that 'angry Pink' sound in it.  Thought she doesn't sing it in that way.<br />11. \\"Lonely Girl\\": A reflection piece by Pink and how life has treated her hard.  Though I think Linda Perry is a good writer and producer, I just hate her voice.<br />12. \\"Numb\\":  Another 'rap song', sounds like a song from Vitamin C's first effort.  Whispering Pink, and a driving chorus sounds very cool together.<br />13. \\"Gone to California\\": Sounds a bit like that one song 2Pac and Dr. Dre did together (I can't think of the title!)  It also sounds a bit like she's traveling through the country in her van.<br />14. \\"My Vietnam\\": It has that war in Vietnam feel at the beginning, it's a poor beginning.  But it gets that guitar little intro, and that straightens everything out.<br />Overall review: 4 stars:  This a radical departure from 'Can't Take Me Home'.  She truly says her mind and expresses it well in this CD, I applaud her for doing such a good album with \\"unknown\\" producers.

B00005JKT8|4.0|If you want to go to a movie with your boyfriend/friends/yourself, then you will like &quot;Kate and Leopold&quot;.  Since I am a bit of a history buff (reenactor from the same time era as Leopold is in,) I enjoyed the movie.  I didn't realize that there was going to be a surprise ending to it, which just shocked me.  It's a very sweet movie, and I don't think it will hurt Meg Ryan or Hugh Jackman's career.  You know how you feel you wanna do one of those movies that gets your spirit up, this would be it!  I'm not going to tell you the plot, I'll just let you go see it and find out for your self and see how you like it, instead of me telling you.  Though I was insulted when I came into the movie theater (the ticket person asked me if I was old enough to see this movie...*scoff*.)  I'll just tell you this:  If you want a warm hearted, giggle-fest, modern New York/love story, you will be pleased by this simple story about believing in love even though it comes up as a 125 year old man shot from the past to the present.  I can't wait till it comes out on video/DVD.
0553579908|3.0|What is it about the second story in a series? Why is it so difficult to keep anything but the prominent aspects of a series alive through the second feature into the third? Beautiful story elements and characters and relationships get lost in the fray of an author's attempt to get the story to some distant destination. Martin's second book is far from filler or fluff, but it leaves a lot to be desired compared to his first effort in this series.<br />Martin continues to do a nice job with some of his many characters, but not all. Some that are vital get dropped in favor of more gratuitous, more gratifying scenes. Some that are minor (so far (?)) get meaty story lines and some fine writing, but to what end? Still other characters are dropped completely and become exposition - that is disappointing in a series that revolves around character development.<br />All in all, it takes the separate plot lines too long to come to fruition, and the characters that you are given reason to care about too long to return. Martin has lost some of his control and power in this book. There are definitive highlights, and you'll need those as you get through. Bran's character gets fleshed out quite a bit, as does Arya's. Catelyn and Sansa become more real, and Tyrion (Oh Tyrion, oh Tyrion) continues to be a joy. There are some fantastic minor characters that play an important role, with hints for the future. <br />Martin is good at hiding the truth behind a shade and a mirror, so who knows what to make of many of his hints and nudges. He builds on several feudal sub-plots to good advantage as the scope of his books continues to grow. There are new villains and some surprises as the kingdom plunges further into chaos. You'll enjoy the book, but let's hope this is the ebb and not the flow.
0671775308|4.0|Its a good book.  I for one like the millionaire mind(second book) better.  But i seem to be alone in that standing.  This book tells us about what millionaire are, but says little about who they are.....their personalities, their level of ambition, their determination and confidence....these are more widely discusses in the sequel. Nonetheless, this book is a good read.  Its a great starter kit, so to speak.
0380817683|4.0|I'm on a Brit Chick Lit jag right now - working my way through Marian Keyes, Isabel Wolff, Lisa Jewell, etc - and this book really caught my attention.  It's darker than the normal book of this type, but riveting.  I found myself unable to sleep, wondering about what would happen to Rachel next, and eventually just got up and finished the book.  Rachel's travels through treatment for drug addiction are fascinating, and very well written.  Definitely recommended, but make sure you've a lot of uninterrupted time because you won't want to put the book down.
B00005QDW1|4.0|No Doubt's fourth release, the up-beat electro-reggae &quot;Rock Steady&quot;, may take some time to adjusting to but it's well worth the effort of listening to and trying to figure out whether you should mosh or grind to No Doubt's somewhat new sound.<BR>   <BR>&quot;Rock Steady&quot; compared to their previous albums obviously has a drastically different sound. But don't let that mislead you into thinking that No Doubt has lost it's originality. No Doubt keeps their &quot;fun ska&quot; style but adds some new elements, such as reggae and a trippy keyboard, to make a happy, dance-able album.  <br />Stefani is no more coping with growing older and finding herself like in &quot;Return of Saturn&quot;. In &quot;Rock Steady&quot;, she's just looking to get down.
B000002572|5.0|Simply put, one of the greatest rock n roll albums of all time.  After you push PLAY, the only button you'll need for the next 45 minutes is VOLUME UP.
B00003JRCQ|5.0|This is a masterpiece is subtlety.  When I first watched it, I was bored and very nearly turned it off without watching it through to the end.  But stick with it, it's well worth it.  <br />It's the story of a young woman who, at the urging of her family and a close family friend, spurned the love of her life.  8 years later she's still regretting it when he reappears in her life.  Resigned to a life of spinsterhood by her family, she becomes nearly invisable to those around her while her former love is exhaulted for his prowess in the intervening years.  Now highly eligible, Anne must watch as he seemingly courts others while her heart breaks again.  <br />But all is not as it seems in this slow moving drama.  And when the twist of another suitor turns the tables, who is it that is really the broken hearted one?  Anne?  Or her beloved Captain Wentworth?  And who is this Mr Elliot that suddenly shows such interest?  <br />Stick with it through the end.  Then watch it again.  You'll fall in love over and over again.  A brilliant piece that makes your heart sigh at the end.  I give it my highest rating.
0064407667|4.0|That's the point of the whole series - the unfortunate events are so unfortunate that they're preposterous.  The kids are pretty one-dimensional but their actions (or rather reactions) are things that kids their age might think up if they were smarter than average.  And I do love Lemony Snicket's explanations of the harder vocabulary words.  They're perfectly in line with the way the whole book is written - as if the author had just turned his head away to hide his smile.  I wish I could give 3 1/2 stars instead of 3 or 4 but I'm happier bumping it up to 4 rather than down to 3.
B00004RFFS|2.0|I'll begin by saying that I bought this edition of IWTV from Amazon and returned it the same week. That might tell you how disppaointed with it I was. Why?<br />First of all, the picture quality is actually poorer than the previous DVD edition (the non-DTS version). The copy Iwatched was actually grainy(!), whereas the other version was very, very clean.<br />Secondly, the special feautres. The list looks quite impressive, and was another reason I bought this version having already bought the first DVD release. The sound is the only decent thing about this disk. The Interview Gallery, the Documentary, and the Introduction (listed as 'A Special Introduction' on the sleeve!) are all culled from the SAME interview clips. I mean, what the hell?! What a complete waste of money, and what a huge disappointment for a fan. The Introduction was just laughable. I expected to see Ann Rice and Neil Jordan sitting together saying Hi, Enjoy the movie. But no. It's just three of the interview clips (they include one of Antonio Banderas too) that are used in the Documentary. Please! It was laughable - ... Now that's funny.<br />What a piece of garbage. At least the original edition didn't purport to be special.<br />Avoid.
0525945636|3.0|The book was ... okay.  There were parts that worked just as they should; but, in others, our heroes were by turn really smart and really, really stupid.  Don't they watch television?  The bad guy always does the same obvious things; why doesn't the good guy know it if I know it?
B00005QDW5|5.0|A musical intoxication is the best way to describe the undescribable force of the Floyd.  And this &quot;Hits&quot; album takes all the brilliance and seemlessly puts it together into a big jam session.  Yes there are some bits missing but if you wanted ever song then buy every album.  Every &quot;Hits&quot; album has things left out but what this gives you is 30 years of music all in one so you don't need to carry around all of your 20 some odd Floyd albums! For what you get it's musical bliss with the best of the best.  I sadly before now hadn't had a chance (or the finaces!) to get the first few albums so hearing Syd and the early oddities is a treat and has inspired some more buying.  early Floyd is truly an odd exsperence and whirls your brain in all directions.  It also has &quot;When The Tigers Broke Free&quot; which is new unless you own &quot;The Wall&quot; movie which it comes from.  This album is an excellent buy which any new or old Floyd fan should get!
0553801481|5.0|Fifteen years ago, FitzChivalry Farseer used all his unwanted powers including telepathy and the dirty magic of Wit that allowed mental ties with beasts to save the Six Duchies (see the fantastic Farseer Assassins trilogy).  A reluctant hero, FitzChivalry handled his abilities and his success by fleeing into the countryside in a self imposed exiled retirement even though he was only twenty at the time.  Most of his friends and associates thought FitzChivalry died during THE ASSASSIN'S QUEST.<br /><br />However, top assassin Chade Fallstar visits FitzChivalry to enlist his help in finding the missing Prince Dutiful, heir to the Farseer throne.  Dutiful is to shortly marry and if he fails to appear at the ceremony, the damage between the Six Duchies could lead to war.  Chade believes only his former student FitzChivalry has any chance of finding the vanished royal.  Though disinclined to do so, FitzChivalry begins a new quest.<br /><br />If you are a fan of fantasy and have not read Robin Hobb, you are missing one of the greats, as the Farseer Assassins trilogy that is as good as the genre provides.  Ms. Hobb's latest tremendous tale brilliantly combines an epic adventure with day to day living so that the audience believes that the hero is performing magical and daring deeds.  FitzChivalry remains a wonderful character who has matured from the youthful optimist into a middle age recluse.  Several other players return, but the audience does not need to go back to the previous series as this novel is a stand alone book.  As the returning Fool would believe that only a fool would miss FOOL'S ERRAND and any subsequent adventures.<br /><br />Harriet Klausner
B000050IE6|5.0|Though I started with &quot;Blackwater Park&quot; I feel that this album surpasses it (many perfer BP and some critics consider it their best labum but what do they truly know?) There are a few reasons for this and the first is that &quot;Still Life&quot; contains too fully acoustic songs with all &quot;clean&quot; vocals which serves a much richer over all sound and feel to the album.  This album is also more jazz influenced and more quirky then the other Opeth albums.  All that is not to say that album isn't as heavy as ever.  It's a very heavy full album with plenty of growling for those of you you love that kind of thing (I prefer the clean sound and the only reason i listen to Opeth at all is that they use it, if it was all growling it would get dull and it doesn't sound to pleasent!) It's another concept album of a mans search for his love Melinda (their broken relationship feel is felt perfectly with the second all acoustic song) At the end the listner feels very satisfied and moved which is proof for this wonderfuly complext and very progessive album!

0780622553|5.0|I am not a huge sci-fi buff, but I do happen to like a lot of the movies in that genera.  When I put this DVD on, I had no idea what to expect.  &quot;Dark City&quot; was a refreshing and brilliant movie that really had me in awe.  This is a visionary experience that shouldn't be missed; stunning in both the story and visuals.<br />In a strange and mysterious city where the sun never shines and time seems to stop moving and where strange and creepy figures walk around and dressed in nothing but black, a man wakes up to find out that his memory has been erased.  To make matters worse, he finds a woman brutally murdered in his hotel room.  This man happens to be John Murdoch, the main character in this labyrinth who wants to know exactly who he is and what is going on.  He wants to know why people think he is some sort of killer and why the cops want him.  He also wants to know why strange figures, he can't figure out if they're human or not, want him dead.  John is determined to find out just exactly who he is and what is going on in an evil and dark city where sunlight never enters and where time stands still.  However, he is about to learn that the truth just might be the ultimate illusion in this dark puzzle of a movie.<br />This film cleverly mixes sci-fi with film noir and pays off by telling us a magnificent story and showing us the most stunning visuals that special effects has to offer us.  Some have compared this movie to &quot;The Matrix,&quot; and complained that it wasn't that good and that &quot;Matrix&quot; was better.  Although I really like &quot;The Matrix,&quot; I have to say that I think this movie is better.  The story was so mind-altering and surprising that you really can't comprehend what you are watching.  This film is also very fast-paced, but the length of the movie is perfect.  The acting was outstanding and really enriched the movie.  It was also brilliantly written and directed.<br />I have to warn you, this movie seems very confusing at first.  I was watching it for the first twenty minutes and I was thinking, &quot;Oh no, this is one of those movies I'm not going to get.&quot;  You will get it.  As the movie goes by, it really does explain what's going on, so don't get frustrated.  Give it a chance.<br />The only thing I cannot figure out is why this film didn't get so much recognition?  How come it wasn't nominated for anything, or WIN anything for that matter?  I know that Roger Ebert absolutely loved this film, but he was the only critic I heart talk about this movie.  It really should've gotten more recognition.  I'm sure there are some sci-fi buffs who have never even heard of this movie.  It's up to us to make sure that this movie gets all the recognition that it deserves.<br />There are also some special features on the DVD.  Not a lot, but they are there.  I've only watched the trailer, for I was more interested in the movie than the special features.  I have a feeling they might reissue this movie on DVD with far more special features.  Maybe it'll be in DTS by then.<br />&quot;Dark City&quot; is a wonderful film that really opens the imagination.  Keep in mind, you really don't have to be into sci-fi to enjoy this.  I think this film can be enjoyed by many different people.  It really all falls on the type of mood you are in.  Again, I make no promises if you will like this film or not, but why not give it a shot?  It's not even that long, so it won't make a difference if you don't like it.  This is a movie that shows us movies can still be creative, yet loaded with special effects.  This is a great film and I look forward into watching it again very soon.first.

B000059ZT4|5.0|I love all incarnations of Bob Marley, but I prefer the vocal stylings of Peter, Bunny, and Bob together. Here you have the trio in perfect form and the Jamaican and American releases make this even more worth the money. Great production and the re-mastering makes this a better release than ever before.<br />Anyway if you are wondering which Marley cd to buy I would highly HIGHLY recommend this one. I happen to really love the vocal stylings of Peter Tosh as in 400 years and Stop That Train. (Naturally Bob has a purely magical vocal styling as well, but I am assuming that even a non-reggae enthusiast would know that). <br />Either way though, if you like Peter's voice as I do, then you may even want to pick up some of his solo releases. Bunny Wailer has a nice catalog of solo releases too. I recommend Blackheart Man. <br />Bottom line...you will not be disappointed here...This can be played at social functions, parties, for children, grandparents, husbands, wives, anywhere to anyone. Beautiful reggae.
B00004ZAV3|4.0|I have been listening to the beatles all my life,my dad got me into them,so i got the beatles 1,and its not a bad cd really,but if you really want to have the ultimate beatles experience,then i would suggest getting the original cd,s,i only own beatles 1,and abbey road,and l love them both,but i was dissapointed,that there were no sgt pepper songs,but it surely beats those annoying rap songs,whatever a rap artist accomplishes all his life the beatles accomplished it with only a album,and this one is it.
B00005MKA1|5.0|Is this a damn fine cd or what? The beautifully perfect Easy Skanking starts the cd off with just the right tone and moves into MY personal favorite KAYA! It is just a fun song with a nice pace and heavy slick riddims. Is This Love is a nice recognizable song for most people I would assume. Sun is Shining is wicked man. I love this one. Great sound. Satisfy My Soul is slow and nice. She's Gone is a nice selection. Misty Morning is a cool mellow tune with some cool horns. Crisis is ok, but not my favorite. I love Running Away (not in the Monty Python Holy Grail sense, but the song on this cd) and I like the voice Bob opts for in this one.  <br />Ahhhh Time Will Tell...what a beautiful song. Guitars are just perfect with the mellow rasta drums. You just can't help but relax when you hear this. Smile Jamaica is ok. I don't particularly like the song, but the dub treatment here is really nice.<br />Bottom Line: I recommend you pick this up. Just sounds too good to pass up.<BR>OneLove
B00005RHGK|5.0|I loved this movie! I love horror movies, and this is finally something to pull us away from those crappy teen slasher movies. The plot was original, and the Creeper was freaky. The two lead actors (Pillips and Long)were great portraying brother and sister, you could almost believe they were ciblins. The Creeper's truck was scary in itself, and was a nice little touch to the movie. The song  &quot;Jeepers Creepers&quot; in the movie added the errie effect, and I get the shivers whenever i hear it.  Trish(Gina Phillips)looked beautiful in the movie so it wasn't to hard to keep my head tuned to the screen. I liked the overall look of the Creeper. It was the first horror villain in a long while to actually freak me out. The ending was a bit lacking in closure, but surprising. It should leave room for a sequel. Overall the movie was great.
B00005KB9R|5.0|Every song here is beautiful. This is proof that you can do a lot with very little. The talent of Bob, Bunny, Peter and the band is just astonishing and the sounds they produce are simply the best.<br />I love to hear Bunny front the mic on a few songs here. Each of the performers are so solid even on their own. No wonder they were such a powerful force for reggae. When you corner the market on talent you can't lose. I am sure you will love this entire cd. Not one bad song.<br />Peace and Love to ya
B00003CXZ1|5.0|Don't let any bad reviews put this film off you? It is a brilliant, brilliant film. Initially I was put off at the concept of the Tomb Raider film... I'm not a big fan of the games and yet I went to the cinema to see it anyway... <BR>I loved every minute of it.. I good blend of action packed sequences (usually put to cracking music), emotional sequences and inventive dialougue at times. <BR>Granted the CGI effects are ropey at times and some bits make you cringe at the screen but this is a great film, certainly one of the best action films of recent years. <BR>And then there is Angelina Jolie... who IS Lara Croft, she is superb... Her English accent is nigh on flawless and she is gorgeous from start to finish. <BR>Buy this film and enjoy it.. I think critics were far to harsh on this film as it really is entertainment at its best.<BR>Rumour has it Jolie has been signed for the sequel and I for one can't wait !
B00005QZ7U|5.0|Hands down, the second best DVD of all time.  A great movie and extraordinary extras.  Can't wait till Baz does Special Editions of his other films.
B00005QDW1|5.0|Rock Steady is awesome.  No Doubt is one of my fav bands and I just love this CD.
B00005RFAI|4.0|A conscious departure from a previously established image is a venture which may often be misunderstood or in the case of Pink, &quot;missundaztood.&quot;  Bad grammar aside, Pink's sophomore session demonstrates a unique mastering of courage stemming not only from her expulsion of much of the R&amp;B focused sound which made her a Top 40 standard, but a willingness to expose herself intimately through her lyrics and her vocals.  The album has many standout tracks including the retrospective &quot;Just Like A Pill,&quot; the surprisingly blues-based duet with Aerosmith frontman Steven Tyler called &quot;Misery&quot; and even the intentionally perky &quot;Get The Party Started.&quot;  For this release, Pink plays up a funk-inspired influence on many tracks and utilizes her distinctive voice to tangibly tie emotion with the lyrics of the songs.  There are probably a handful of people who will be slightly turned off by Pink's latest musical face-lift, but those who are willing to invest adequate listening time will gain an appreciation for this artist's talents.  Pink provides decisive evidence that she can consistently evolve as an artist while simultaneously providing her dedicated fans with just enough tinted sass to continue praising her musical endeavors.
B000002MM8|5.0|...Ariadne is so beautiful it makes you want to cry...<br />The sounds that Dead Can Dance can compile into one CD is amazing.
B00005RIKD|5.0|Having seen Sting live over a dozen times, I'm now happy to have this live cd. Sting's emotions from 9/11 events shine through and have produced wonderful renditions of his songs - my favorite being &quot;Every Breath You Take.&quot; Sting is an artist beyond comparison and he continues to prove this to the world with every album and live concert.

B0000399WI|5.0|Another well deserved 5 stars for this film! This is one of those movies i will never get tired of watching.
B00005QK3W|5.0|&quot;Driving Rain&quot; is the best Macca album of ALL-TIME without question. Some of the material on this album ranks with the Beatles best. Reading some of the reviews here on Amazon.com really amaze me. What in the world do some of the people who gave this album bad ratings want to hear?; Wings inspired MUZAK? This album reminds me of Paul during his Sgt. Pepper\White Album period - Paul when he was the most creative, top of his craft. Thank You Paul for making this brilliant album, I've waited 30 years for this one!
B000002A3T|5.0|The Division Bell is Pink Floyd's crowning glory in their long and storied evolution.  Many Floyd fans seem divided between the David Gilmour or Roger Waters camps &amp; I would have to say that I am firmly in Gilmour's, ('cause I too am a guitarist?)  I listened to Floyd all through my teens, mainly Ummaguma, Atom Heart Mother, Obscured by Clouds and Meddle &amp; we loved their spacey jams, different melodies and interesting lyrics.  Of course Dark Side of the Moon and Wish You Were Here and undoubtly two of their finest works and need no introduction.  As The Wall was Waters epic creation, he didn't merely do it by himself, though he seems to think so.  Gilmour's unmistakeable guitar licks are every bit as memorable and defining as Waters lyrics and concept.  Some people think Animals is a good work, but I find it and The Final Cut rather boorish &amp; uninspiring as Waters seems to want to lay out his tired agenda on the fans (and his band mates)and by wanting all the credit.  His lyrical &amp; musical talents are indeed remarkable, but it seems that individual egos in a mega band will eventually pull it apart.  <br />The Division Bell shows that the &quot;Waters-less&quot; Pink Floyd is every bit as dynamic as ever (of course they said the Floyd was never going to make it after Syd Barrett left too).  I came to discover the Division Bell by the way of the Pulse concert video.  For whatever reason I had lost track of Floyds music for many years and started regaining interest with a recent purchase of Wish You Were Here, wanting to learn the title track.  Like millions of other Pink Floyd fans across the globe it was hard not to be drawn into a keen interest in their music and their history.  I read up on them deeply, but more importantly by listening to an array of their works it is not hard to like the Division Bell.  Who says Gilmour can't write lyrics?  His songs with Richard Wright and others are both musically and lyrically moving and beautiful.  There is every bit of the aritistry and characteristic Pink Floyd sound of the Wall years and tours,  only better.  If you chose to read into some of the lyrics you might find some past issues being dealt with, but thats not the focus of the work.  Songs like &quot;High Hopes&quot; and &quot;Coming Back to Life&quot; are great pieces and the album flows with exceptional character, vibrancy and and cohesion.  Gilmour's guitar work shines in many facets - gritty &amp; tasteful distortion lead guitar, suttle runs &amp; licks and nice acoustic guitar work.  Richard Wright on keyboards obviously plays a great part of the overall sound, just as he did with earlier Pink Floyd works. He contributes both on writing some of the music and lyrics.  &quot;Keep Talking&quot; is a tune that seems to revive the theme of insanity or madness or just personal confusion that has been around Floyd's music for long time, yet it still rings fresh &amp; true.  <br />Much of the Division Bell is on the Pulse concert video and it is to me one of the most moving concert videos I have ever seen. The Pulse production seamlessly blends Pink Floyd from many eras - &quot;One of These Days&quot; (Meddle), Shine on You Crazy Diamond&quot; (Wish You Were Here), Another Brick In The Wall, the entire Dark Side of the Moon album PLUS the new songs off the Division Bell.  In classic and epic Pink Floyd style this concert gives an incredible light and video show.  It shows more importantly, however, it is a sincere professional endeavor, by showing Glimour, Wright and Nick Mason (on drums) having fun playing great Pink Floyd music, regardless of who wrote which tune.  Those 3 are still a big part of the the Pink Floyd sound and the productions of Pulse and the Division Bell are deep and rich.  That they are not saddled by so many of the past hangups and by putting out these two very good productions shows them to be just as vibrant (or more so, really) than the ugliness of the late Waters years.  There doesn't seemto be that nagging agenda of cynicism and unresolved issues of those years.  <br />The Division Bell is a refeshingly exciting work from a band that has gone through many things in some 35 odd years.  I find it soulful and moving and it does what a great album should do by evoking many moods and feelings.
B00003CXB2|5.0|The beauty of Lawrence of Arabia is how the story is told, not through melodramatic dialogue, but through the actions of a tremendous actor in an epic setting. <br />The most telling of sequences in the film is the long and improbable journey of Lawrence and Feisal's men across the long desert to Aqaba.  Just as the expedition is about to exit the desert, Lawrence defies the protests of Sherif Ali to retrieve a wayward member of his party who would otherwise be doomed in the sweltering desert sun.  The single shot of Lawrence on the horizon, at first barely visible, accomplishing his unlikely feat of rescue tells us more about Lawrence than any dialogue could do.  Conversely, the attack on Aqaba, the supposed climax of the first act, takes a fraction of the time.  <br />Filmed today, the screen time alloted to these to scenes would likely be reversed.  There lies the beauty of Lawrence of Arabia. Lean's Lawrence of Arabia does not tell the tale of Lawrence's adventures, it tells the story of Lawrence himself.  <br />I highly recommend seeing this on as large a screen as possible.  Purchase of this dvd for viewing on anything less than a 32 inch screen is going to only frustrate and disappoint.  I viewed it on a 36 inch screen and was very pleased.
B00003CXHJ|5.0|along with Das Boot.  Wonderfully done.  Edge of your seat suspense with excellent plot development and attention to detail.  <br />Interesting that some feel compelled to diss this movie based on historical inaccuracy because the British found the enigma.  Since when did this movie claim to be historically correct?  It's not Blackhawk Down, people.  Also, I see a lot of the requisite snobbery from critics who think they are on the Academy Awards Committee and feel compelled to state the oldest complaint in the book: &quot;lack of character development.&quot;  <br />Look, there's only so much dinner with wife and kids that I can handle in a movie.  I easily identified with the characters, and anyone who wasn't completely rooting for Matthew McConaughey to pull this off probably has an insecurity complex her/himself.  And when the German sub captain tried the morse code and was discovered?  Talk about gut wrenching.  &quot;Lack of character development?&quot;  Oh please, at least be more original than that.<br />The criticism of the lone black submariner is without merit.  Very often on a World War 2 submarine, there were &quot;token&quot; blacks.  This was not unusual.  Trust me, this movie was not trying to make any political statement.  It was meant to be an action movie that honored submariners, and it did it so with class and distinction.  It was incredibly suspenseful, with excellent use of submarine language without spelling it all out, and good use of sound and cinematography in particular.  The chief did an excellent job, too.<br />I laughed at the criticism of Paxson as being too stoic a commander.  How many naval vessel captains are gung-ho lunatics?  Yea, like I'd want that in a commander.  Trust me, if they were, they'd never reach captain.  <br />If you are a history buff or are from England and get all defensive that the British captured the enigma, then don't watch this.  It will make you go into a tizzy.  But if you are not a nationalistic freak andjust want good entertainment that is also a tremendous tribute to any submariner of any country at any time, then U-571 is a suspenseful treat.
B00004YKUY|4.0|When I learned that Steve Perry had been replaced, I chalked Journey up to a lost cause (as Van Halen, Genesis and Foreigner when Roth, Collins and Graham, respectively, left their camps). But a video of the band with Steve Augeri on the bigscreens at Best Buy changed my mind. &quot;Higher Place&quot; was playing, and the music was very powerful without being regurgitated material (a la Trial By Fire, for the most part). But Augeri's voice surprised me: His voice maintains the integrity of Journey's sound without sounding like he's imitating Perry.<br />Finally laying hold of the CD, I was quite surprised at the material! This was Journey??? Sonically, yes; albeit out of the 'tin can' of older days. Augeri has his 'Perry' moments, but he frequenly comes across as just a great singer who sounds like, well, Steve Augeri. He's a great fit and a brilliant singer (too late, Eddie). But what pleases me most is the musical direction. The material is fresh, with some tracks carrying a touch of Journey's trademark riffs and others taking musical risks (and succesfully so).<br />&quot;Loved By You&quot; easily rises to the top of ANY love ballad that Journey has ever crafted, both in lyrics and performance. &quot;World Gone Wild&quot;, &quot;Live and Breathe&quot;, &quot;Kiss Me Softly&quot;, and a few others have the band exploring musical directions not found in prior releases, and it makes for a stronger recording. (Whomever said &quot;Higher Place&quot; is &quot;Separate Ways, Part 2&quot; obviously never heard &quot;Message of Love&quot; on TBF (it's the same basic song, even the same keyboard solo!). Steve Perry's voice will be somewhat missed in the mix, but his prominant influence on the band's direction won't be. Augeri has the strength this band needs to continue, and having left a job at &quot;The GAP&quot; for this, I'm sure he has plenty of energy and creativity to bring to the studio and stage.<br />(Oh, and Eddie, Steve Perry's still available... )
006441034X|5.0|Once again Diana manages to write a captivating and suspensful novel. Throughout the duration of the story,I found myself hoping for sophie to be restored to her normal self. Diana is rather wicked, though, in the way she ends her novels. I always want to know what happens to the beautifully developed characters next, like for example in charmed life what happens to cat or Gwendolen?
B000056HE9|5.0|This is my all-time favorite Christmas movie.  It is very whimsical and funny, but not overly sappy like It's A Wonderful Life.  It also has its serious side as it reminds us what the Christmas spirit really means - both as individuals and a society.  These two themes are perfectly exemplefied in the skating and ending sermon scenes respectively.  The entire cast does a superb job and the special effects are a lot of fun.  They really don't them like this anymore.
