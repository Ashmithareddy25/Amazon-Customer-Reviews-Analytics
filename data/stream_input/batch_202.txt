B000V1BDIG|5|So thankful for this bottle of oil! I went to my 30 week appt & the first thing the doctor said when she saw my huge belly was - &#34;What are you putting on your belly?!&#34; I was confused until she said that she was surprised I did not have a single stretch mark. I owe it all to Belli Elasticity Belly Oil! I have gained more weight than expected (30 pounds) but still no stretch marks.
B000ELP5KA|5|This is the only think that relieves itching of poison ivy for me! I get anywhere from 1-3 hours of relief before I have to reapply. The negatives are that it's expensive and you smell like Pinesol... Worth it!
B002MUAP2E|5|Awesome!
B00WHFDU2Q|5|I love it
B002WTC37A|5|i enjoyed this product worked as advertised
B00430CRX6|5|I use this daily for the last 20 years and it is the real stuff to keep me clean and fresh.
B0018LL9FA|5|This is a tiny little jar, and woe to you if you knock it over, because it's a loose powder and you will lose some of it. But it is just the right dark color and goes on easily. I find most pressed browns that come with multi-color palettes are too light and also have glossy sparkles, which an old lady doesn't need. A loose brown goes on darker.
B00FAW2R54|5|I Love Love this hair....
B000P75VW0|3|The product arrived on time however, I used it twice and by the third time it no longer sprayed. The glitter gets clogged in the nozzle and it doesn't come out. I wanted to use it for my wedding, but had to find something else to compromise.
B003TBYW74|1|Cannot recover anything.  Very disappointed! We have been used over three weeks. However, the skin condition still reminds the same.
B00070E8LA|4|This oster classic motor clipper worked wonders for me. As a balding person, it really helped me clip the sides of my head for a smooth shave. Used this product for a while now and very much would recommend this to anyone who is interested in skipping the expensive barber shops!<br /><br />Pros: Very solid construction, clean cutting lines and great steel components.<br /><br />Cons: You need to use the power cord for it to work. This can be difficult when cutting your own hair sometimes. My next purchase in this category will certainly be a battery-option.
B0031NRC86|4|I've been looking for a retinoid that was gentler than the prescription Retin A and rolled the dice with this one after reading some reviews.  I've been on this now for a 1.5 months (except for a week of traveling) and I must say that I like this product a lot.  After a week or so of using this, I have noticed improvement in my skin. I've used less foundation, and the overall appearance of my skin just looks very healthy.  I've shed a little, maybe once the entire time,  which I expected, but still to my surprise that the shedding is not heavy and not scaly compared to when I was using Retin A.  A little goes a long way.  One pad can cover your face, and like what others said there's enough for your décolleté and hands.  The only complain I have is the yucky oily greasy feel it has upon touching my skin.  There is a lil tingle too (not painful, more like tiny fizzes) when you apply it.  This almost turned me off completely when I first put it on BUT, it dries on your face clear and clean!!  No oily residue!  During the first few days/weeks it was the last thing I put on my face in the evenings, but recently I have been following it with a moisturizer for my face feels dry and tight after applying it.  But to me this is normal too because once again, it was something I've experience before when using retinoids.<br />I am very happy with this and will continue to purchase.
B007UZ9HG6|1|First we did:  reading the manual and watching the DVD,<br />my GF used it 3 sessions of 5 min in our living room to avoid Humidity of any kind.<br />Unit was set on a hard floor and she was very careful not to  close any air circulation on the flash head.<br />After total of 15 min the unit doesn't flash any more. Everything looks fine but it doesn't flash.<br />Seems the Bulb gave up after 15 min using the device on LvL 4, and I am sure lvl 1 to 3 are good for baby hair's and nothing more.<br />A little disappointing for a so expensive machine.<br />And she doesn't see much result, but that is too really to judge.
B001MSR7UU|3|Hey Guys, i just received this product and this small bottle does it come with a sprayer?? coz the one i received does not have one!! have i received a damaged product or does the small bottle does not have a sprayer. DO i have to talk to the vendor about it??
B00R3TZM1I|5|Looks just like I expected!
B000U7S07S|5|love it
B003KEBR6Y|4|Quite a bit larger than I was expecting, but good performance. Love the sparkles!
B00ATFJ8NQ|3|This is my second bottle, I am going to be very honest, I like it because it does leave your hair soft and is not made with harmful sulfates, it does not completely  eliminate frizz and all the other stuff that the adds claim, it does a better job than regular shampoo in terms of being a more healthy product for your hair. I do not like that it is so expensive I think they can do a better job with pricing this product as it is not a magic formula but it will last about a month if you only use it once a week with long hair. It does not leave any soapy residue behind after you rinse and it has a mild lovely sent. I suggest you try it at least once to determine if it is right for you, the product is nice the price is not.
B0002AHY6Q|5|I have many crowns on m y teeth and it is imperative that I keep the gums healthy-floss sometimes irritates my gums when I get too vogorous and the pik is a gentler but useful way to augment the care. I find this model easy to use, store and less cumbersome than the older styles.ALso travels well!
B00016XJ4M|5|This product cleans my face so well.  My skin feels so clean and looks to healthy when I use this.
B0047VSW94|1|The handle is too long and I have to hold the handle up near the blue light and it is hard to do.  Wish I could return it.  Can I?
B004XRC18K|1|Still trying to figure out how they can sell samples that have 'not for resale&#34; written right on it!
B0094J2OE8|5|I bought this without knowing what it smelled like based on the recommendation of a ton of other wet shaving veterans. Glad I did. The scent is hard to describe but amazing!!! Will be trying their other varieties.
B00C7PZ20O|5|Oh now what can I say, it's toothpaste folks.  Though for those that have a reaction to Sorbitol like myself etc then this doesn't contain it and is way cheaper than some of the special brands that boast about not having it in that are $12-13 for a small tube.
B002B4EF9U|5|I like this product, it wonderful. My eyebrow still in a nice style during a day :).<br />don't hesitate to try it.
B002ZJW1VA|5|Have found it hard to purchase in local stores lately so I stocked up at a reasonable price and am still satisfied with the product.
B0041OMQEO|5|This set of Little Teasers is fantastic.  The colors are beautiful.  I always get compliments whenever I wear them.  They last on my nails for two weeks without chipping.  The only problem is my husband wants to use them to make his fishing lures!
B000U5R030|5|it was exactly what i expected
B000052YM7|4|I am seeing some slow changes using this product every other night (I am alternating with a Retin-A). For the price and what you get, I do recommend this product.
B00E0TE4RC|4|I'm giving this a 4 for now but will review again later after I've used the product longer. Having been in sales, I think a lot of reviewers here have cases of buyers remorse. Many are uncomfortable with these types of sales tactics. I too was in Vegas and pulled in. My husband was with me and he is always giving me crap about how women are suckers for products and will believe anything. However, after the one eye treatment and seeing the instant results, he couldn't get his wallet fast enough. My sales person was very adamant about using this product at NIGHT! This is not intended for day use. It does become dry and flakey. You do not want to put makeup on top. I had been out in the sun and this product really pumped up my skin making white lines where my wrinkles WERE. No big deal.  Just need some color there now but the difference is dramatic. Is there a cheaper product that works similarly? Maybe. I have yet to investigate ingredients, etc. and I will. It is a little pricey but not if you go to the cosmetics counter at the department stores and drop 100-200 on brands you know that only last a months or so or if you go the route of fillers and Botox. I do think that not having a return policy is not a confidence builder but I truly think a lot of these reviewers felt uncomfortable with the sales process and clearly have buyers remorse. I've been ecstatic about the results in my limited use. Take aways: use at night, instructions are for once a week and it is not intended for daytime use under makeup. More later after longer usage.
B000HP3MIU|5|Very good product.
B003AVNLO8|5|I have tried them all from Ponds to Perricone and none compare with these cloths.  The cleansing is excellent and the convenience of having a cloth to work with  and then throw away is unequaled.
B00HIDT94U|5|me encantaron
B00VXMXNBC|3|Disapointed
B001PATGJA|5|My eyes are very dry and I use this at bedtime.
B006PKVYMC|5|On those days when you just want to rnse off - no hair complications! LOVE THIS CAP! Def recomend this!
B0044TIP0K|2|Yes To Blueberries Eye Firming Treatment,  Was a let down. I used the product daily until it was gone. I was shocked because I have used a few  YES products such as yes to carrots body butter etc All were excellent.. I did not see any difference around my eyes at all. I seriously hate writing a bad review but for me personally the product did not do anything at all. Perhaps you may or may not  have a better outcome then I did.
B0013NB7DW|5|An Efficient Pre-Electric Shave Lotion.GREAT BUY.
B00HAE1LO8|5|Love this.  I can see a difference in my skin already
B000NDTPRI|5|My doctor gave this to me after a laser treatment, and I've been using it for 2 years now.  Just a TINY amount (so it lasts a long time) on the skin soothes and moisturizes.  I love this stuff!  Does not clog pores, and my skin looks and feels like porcelin.
B001G7PM8G|4|Works great is a bit greasey but works well on my hair which I keep short and combed back does not dry up or get hard like gels tried many different products this one has always been my favorite.
B00CXADQ4M|1|This review is from: SUPER SALE THIS WEEKEND ONLY, YALMEH Super Youth Eye Cream , Eye Cream For Wrinkles  Dark Circle Treatments   Eye Cream   Best Eye Cream  Natural Eye Cream Anti Aging Skin Care   Anti Aging Eye Cream   Eye Firming Cream  Men &Women Eye Cream    Age Eye Cream  100% Money Back Guarantee! (Misc.)<br />I didn't start thinking about my skin and aging until I moved out to the desert. When I did, I started trying various products, many which were flukes and others that only moisturized.<br /><br />I choose Yalmeh's Super Youth Eye Cream for the supposed natural ingredients that aren't supposed to make you break out--i.e., less chemicals. For the price, which hurt, you do get A Lot. It came quickly but was poorly packaged and came to me damaged but salvageable.<br /><br />Since mid-Janurary of this year, I've been using it solely, day and night under a SPF moisturizer. It's white, very rich and luxurious in texture but thick and greasy. I have to spend a little extra time to dab it under and around my eyes as it doesn't absorb right away.<br /><br />After 3+ months, I have seen ZERO results when it comes to my eyes. I had read that many use this as an all over the face and I did that...until I broke out like mad ALL OVER. I thought maybe it was something else so I kept it strictly on my eyes and around my mouth and most of the acne disappeared, so I tried again, and once again, a major breakout. I still do get occasional breakouts in the areas I use the product. I had to stop using it. None of the claims are legit. In fact, it made the skin around my eyes WORSE. I've since thrown it away and good riddance.<br /><br />Despite the claim of being a 'miracle' eye cream, I didn't expect miracles, I just wanted something a little better than the stuff I'd been using. It was a waste of money and I'd give it zero stars if I could, exactly what it did for me. When I realized it was a complete sham of a product, I went back to read the 'glowing' reviews to see if I'd missed something about the product that others before me experienced. I don't understand the 5 star reviews!!! The troll that patrols this page will give an automatic 'unhelpful' click if you post a negative review, just like other 1-3 star reviews, which makes me wonder how many of the 'reviews' are actually by real customers and not fake. One reviewer (Jason from Denver--posted on June 5, 2014) I found was harassed by the company and they kept calling him to re-do his review and give their product a better rating--wtf!?!? My negative review prompted an immediate response and the rep states they didn't claim it was a miracle product on their site when they did in fact claim so but have since removed it. Blah. Blah. BLAH.<br /><br />DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT. IT'S A COMPLETE B-U-S-T!!! I WILL NEVER BUY A PRODUCT FROM THIS COMPANY EVER AGAIN!!!I'd missed something about the product that others before me experienced. I don't understand the 5 star reviews!!!

B00M8EOU9I|5|This stuff is AMAZING!!! It doesn't only make the tapers easier to stretch but it actually helps heal things too! I had a keloid from my lip ring, and I put some of this on the outside of the hole, and I s*** you not the next day it was gone!! Completely gone!! Plus it smells wonderful. :)
B007DAYTSE|5|This moisturizer is fantastic.  It instantly plumps, smooths, hydrates, and refreshes my skin.  My skin is on the oilier side, but it gets dry occasionally.  When I use OxyDerm nightly my skin looks and feels as good as it can, year-round.  For my oily skin, this is not a good daytime moisturizer because it takes some time to absorb into my skin, but if you have dry skin it's probably perfect day and night. (For daytime I use Embryolisse Hydra-Mat or Lait Creme Concentree). Oxyderm is great on face, neck, around my eyes, and even on my hands when they're chapped. This is one of the best skin care products I've ever used.  Another reviewer mentioned \\"beads\\" in this...?  I'm on my third jar and I haven't noticed any beads... (Just because I don't notice them doesn't mean they're not there, of course. Maybe I'm misinterpreting whatever is meant by \\"beads\\".)It could also be that the formulation may have changed.  The jars I've have used are silky smooth, and cooling.  The texture is almost like a gel, but there's no stickiness or  clumps.
B004GERII8|5|19 years of searching for acne products that actually works and does not produce a new dilemma such as redness, dryness, peeling, oily complexion or make my face worst.  I started to have a break out at early teens and ever since then i was on quest for a product that will git rid of my acne, zits, or whatever you call it.  I've tried so many products such as:    1. proactive  2. murad  3. acnexus  4. asso soap  5. neutrogena oil free acne wash  6. neutrogena anti wrinkle/ anti blemish  7. phisoderm  8. oil of olay total effects cleanser  9. lerosett gunella of sweden  and many other products i've used that i can't remember. Then one day i have come across therapores after an infinite search online. I tried it and for the first week my face didn't improve at all and if any it made it worst.  But I guess most acne product claims to make your face worst before it gets better so I patiently waited for another week and voila, it actually reduces my acne.  Another week passed and my face were almost clear as day.  Even now, my face stayed clear.  I believe this product works for me. Thanks much Therapores!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B00028QFAY|5|So far so good, this is one of the most non smell intrusive, eco friendly,locally owned deodorant that actually works really well!
B00JU50MUE|5|I wanted a hand sanitizer for my daughters lunchbag, this is sturdy and the attachment is strong. We are very pleased with it.
B004GCVQM4|5|I have started to 'dry brush' and was using a shorter handled brush (also purchased on Amazon) but wasn't able to access the back of me.  This brush not only is perfect for the job, but it is made exquisitely.  The wood is very smooth and the brush is lovely just-firm-enough natural bristles.  It feels like heaven on the tenderer parts of me like my décolletage and under arms.  Pair this with the sugar scrubs that are offered here by the 3's and your dry brushing followed by scrub experience is complete.
B005V3AV5U|5|the samples are very small but the product itself is fantastic! i absolutely love the sheer of these minerals on my skin! and no chemicals! it is the best mineral make up i have tried so far.
B0000Y3GIE|3|My nails are a little stronger with it, but I still have crack issues. I do not know if my nails are beyond Nailtique help, but I am sticking with it because my nails are worse without it.
B000ITL7ZU|1|I would only give this a half star. These are minature. The description was NOT clear as to the size, the measurements given in the description are for all 5 pieces together!!! Returned these.
B00HMUDJXG|5|I really like it! It makes my face smoother, and tighter! I highly recommend it!!
B0028LLO7M|5|Tried a trial then went looking for more!  Works and smells great too!  I would recommend this one for eye treatment
B00HR929WO|5|Have been using this cologne for years for hubby. He loves it and mostly I love it. Also very good price.
B0037MIIO8|5|Its a nice cleanser I have been using it a for a month or so now. Its not very hard on your face.
B00B49EALG|3|I like the setting powder, but it so fine and the container spills, no matter how carefully I open it.  A great deal of the product ends up on my counter each time I use it.  Perhaps it' a flaw in the container.....pretty wasteful.
B00885VAPS|1|This was nothing more than pantyhose with a band around it.  The second time I wore it, it ended up running (just like pantyhose).  I would not recommend this and I don't wear it any more.
B00HJD8NLY|3|I did not find the serum tighten my face like other serums.
B002L6NZJE|4|We used this on our recent trip to Europe.  Just take a couple ounce and dilute it once you get to your destination.
B001ECQ51G|1|I loved how soft this made my dry skin, but it is not worth the ugly, red, bumpy rash all over my neck, chest, arms, hands, and legs. I would strongly caution use of this. Please note that I generously use many lotions and have never had this experience before.
B007XCQ94Y|4|Great light for the price!  On the large side and the cord is bulky, but works well. Would recommend it.
B0009F79EQ|3|I use h2ocean quite often. I ordered two but when they got here, one didn't have the spray nozzle and the other one, the nozzle broke off.
B000BF1396|5|works great
B003CP12MU|1|Horrible aftertaste that leaves mouth feeling not-so-clean and fresh as if I want to brush again with something else. Worse, slimy white mucus-like stuff collects on teeth and tongue after use. I'm a longtime Crest user but the ProHealth and Crest flavored with cinnamon (the Fresh Burst?) both cause unfavorable reactions, and Internet searches show I'm not alone. (I am allergic to the cinnamon oil, which causes a burning sensation on my tongue.) Will never buy/try the ProHealth again.
B002NKK60E|3|Heard about these on the Today  Show.  Ordered them and I love them.  Very convenient / easy to use.  they even remove eye makeup
B000O3VRTQ|5|Been purchasing and using this for years. Excellent price and service.
B00NQOZVQK|4|Works as advertised
B003JCLP6E|3|I could not tell a difference in my hair.
B000E7STOS|5|My husband got this as a gift a few years ago and since then he has stuck to it. When something works....!<br />Love the smell!
B003IQA5LW|5|Excellent
B00VU06RVK|3|This smells unbelievably heavenly- like maybe the best smelling product I've ever used. It glides on beautifully and stays clean in the package (some natural deodorants melt weirdly and get messy). However, it just doesn't work :( No matter what I was doing, it wouldn't even last a few hours. I am not a particularly sweaty or smelly lady, either. I strongly recommend this scent in their other products though!!
B0042L1XJK|4|Living in FL means instant frizz but this did seem to alleviate quite a bit of it. Glad I tried it!
B004MPZLVC|1|I am totally dissatisfied with this purchase. I had purchased this product previously from another source and loved it. This purchase has a very distinct odor and also the cloth has an orange tint ( the one I purchased previously had a pleasant citrus scent and had no color). I loved the natural tan color results from the prior purchase but this one is totally different, not natural at all. As far as I can tell this purchase is not the same product. Very disappointed.
B001MS73GS|5|Tastes good and doesn't burn.
B000FYVOJC|1|These never seem to work.
B000FCFOLS|5|MY DENTIST TOLD ME TO USE THIS WHEN I FIRST HAD IMPLANTS AND NOW IT IS HARD TO FIND THE HANDLES AT THE DRUGSTORE.AM ABLE TO FIND THE BRUSHES BUT NO HANDLE.
B00LU440V0|5|was skeptical about its performace at first, compared to its more expensive counterpart. I guess I judged prematurely based on the amount of money I paid for it, BUT, honestly, it does the job and it does the job so well. I would definitely purchase again. Well worth your money. the package also came earlier than expected. highly recommended.
B000ZLQJHC|5|I could not stop my itching in an unmentionable backside area. Tried everything and Sudocrem is all that worked.<br />Saved me from a lot of misery.
B00FTYOC7E|5|just like the one I buy from the catalog but not as expensive. Arrived earlier too, will be purchasing this again when I run out.
B0078H4ZVS|5|These pads are awesome.  My skin is all glowy and soft after using nightly for just a few days.  I am prone to dry skin patches but these have gotten rid of them and I don't need moisturizer after if I don't feel like applying it.  They are a rip off on here but you can get them at drug stores for about 4$.  I am stocking up for sure.
B00341L31M|5|I am so delighted that I can buy Avon through Amazon.<br />I love Avon products and for me, a natural blonde, they are about the only people who make my  color brow pencil.<br />It is soft and easy to apply, but most of all, can be sharpened with a pencil sharpener to a great point.<br />I will be buying more of the same thing soon. The price is wonderful too, and as with any Avon or Amazon, good value<br />and fast service.<br />Thanks Avon, thanks Amazon, my favorite sight.<br />Ann Knowles.
B000SFJZ30|5|Pretty color
B00JNHBVUO|5|I loveeeee this oil. When you put it on after you shower it leaves your skin so smooth and it smells so good😍
B000C1UEZI|5|Grey Flannel cologne is a wonderful product. I just love the way this cologne smells!!! It arrived packed in its own special grey bag.  A great gift for a special man.
B000NVMM1G|5|Ordered this for myself and love the soft fragrance.  It is soothing to dry skin and never oily or greasy.
B000VSZDVW|4|I use this oil for my face and I like the way it softens my skin. I didn't notice any difference in my wrinkles, though, nor in small and occasional rashes/irritations that I used to get before using the oil and I also get now when using the oil. All in all, a good product and probably preferable to other face creams because it's natural, but not the miracle worker I expected from reading the reviews.
B0009OAGWE|4|Very good product for the money.
B000FPYQHS|5|I am absolutely thrilled with this product.  As a brunette, I've always had issues when I've tried to use baby powder to absorb excess oil and product in my hair, because it's very visible.  Oscar Blandi's Pronto Dry Shampoo also made my hair feel much silkier than baby powder ever has, and it's completely  invisible.  It has a very nice, sweet lemon scent that I find refreshing...plus, if you're using baby powder, you SMELL like baby powder (and most people will know why).  I was also really pleased with how little of this product is necessary to make my hair feel clean and refreshed...and I was pleasantly surprised how easily it was to get off of my black pants when I spilled some (that can be a nightmare with other powder products).  I really can't say enough good things about this product.  It was totally worth it, and I plan on using it regularly!
B009XEANGU|4|Smells a little as if it has been burnt, but I'm still happy
B000I6N8AK|5|They were just as described, I am even going to have to order a few more. And they even arrived on time! I just wish it was a bit more heavy Styrofoam that would be perfect. Good buy for items I received.
B001B2OVBU|4|The marker is easier to use, but for the price, I couldn't go wrong with the liquid. If you are careful in just getting a little bit on the sponge, there's no problems.
B004JQXKVW|5|If your hair is super fried I recommend this product just make sure to use as directed so you don't damage your hair further. I constantly flat iron my hair & bleach out chunks to almost pure white (I'm a red head naturally so that's tough on it) and this product has definitely helped to get my hair back to a healthy state. I also have the conditioner that goes along with it. I tend to use the conditioner maybe once or twice a week after first bleaching & if my hair is super fried I will add in the treatment serum within a day or two of bleaching my hair
B004SNAE06|5|I've tried a number of toothpastes to help problem gums, even some organic toothpastes. Colgate Gum Defense helps me the most.
B000PVPEFU|5|This blush is the best for all skin colors/types. I have used it for a few years now and love it. It lasts a long time too. The color is wonderful for all seasons! A must have blush.
B003BQL2Q6|1|I bought this was very old and smells very,very bad.I retuned  and seller send me anther one.<br />know new one is worst . and just i lost my money.
B0081E6YRK|3|A little background information: I am 29 years old with paper white skin. I had never had acne in my life  until about six months ago, and BOOM. I felt like I was waking up every morning to 3 or 4 new zits. I tried acne products and felt like I was yo-yo-ing between oily broken out skin and dry peeling skin. :P<br /><br />I got this product one week ago in hopes that it would fade my acne scars, which are quite prominent on my fair skin. I use it twice daily (as I have not yet purchased the daytime formula) immediately after washing my face in the morning and before bed.<br /><br />The Good: My skin does feel smoother, and the acne scars seem to have faded slightly (of course, it's only been one week). As a bonus, I feel like it has helped control new outbreaks. This may just be a coincidence, but I hope it continues.<br /><br />The Bad: It doesn't \\"tingle\\" when I put it on, it BURNS. I'm a relatively stubborn person, however, so I continue to use it regularly. Also, I've noticed some patches of skin peeling a little. They aren't red and irritated like they were with acne products, so I can accept that.<br /><br />It is worth mentioning that peeling and irritation are listed as possible side effects of overuse and should stop after skin adjusts. I hope this is the case, because the benefits are too good to give up, at this point.
B00KECQ8BY|5|My wife like this product
B003S54HGM|1|Battery quite working or accepting a charge after 1 month.
B001ET76OO|5|Great!
B000VXVEGK|5|This neutralizing shampoo made my hair feel better than any I have ever used. I have very hard water where I live and when I used this my hair was so soft.
B00AE07CPM|5|Does what it says on the tin. My dandruff problem improved a ton when I started using this. And it works for a wet or dry look. I have very fine hair but I like it to go up a bit at the front but look natural and not &#34;gelled&#34;. It does just that.
B0007DHH7Y|4|So far it's good .
B0062CTOY8|5|I purchased this oil to use in my hair. I've stopped using all products in my hair, even shampoo, and instead I water wash every other day, plus use a baking soda wash/apple cider vinegar rinse 1x week. I put a few drops of this oil in a spray bottle with water, and mist it on my hair after showering, concentrating on the scalp. I purchased this oil because I read rosemary is good for thinning hair, scalp health, and to promote hair growth. I've only been using it for a few weeks, so it's hard to tell if there have been any benefits, but I like the way it smells and my hair looks & feels healthy.
B00L2SWF7K|5|Very good moisturizer. I have really dry skin. I usually have to use  greasy moisturizer to cover it up. This is not greasy and works and feels great. I will definitely buy again.
B00HIDT94U|5|Great brush set, love!
B000052ZBD|5|Came early..so happy
B005CHHO4Q|4|These are for my I-light Pro machine to help in hair reduction,and that is what it does.
B000G647Y8|5|The Tweezerman Badger Shaving Brush is an economical approach to a &#34;luxury&#34; wet shave. When used with a quality razor and blades, you can have your &#34;barbershop&#34; shave in the comfort of your own home each morning.  Holds it bristles, makes great lather, and feels great on my face. I love it!
B008SE7W2Y|5|Love it with my Clarisonic!
B00N2WWGC8|5|this tube will last a long time because a little bit goes a long long way with this stuff! Don't get any near your roots because it will make your really greasy, but when used properly on the length of the hair, I can't tell you how much it made me love my hair. (I have hair that's cut just above my shoulders and I use a teeny tiny bit-about 3/4 the size of a dime)<br />a salon owning friend of mine used it when she cut my hair and I couldn't believe how amazing my hair looked and felt. Soft without being staticky, the ends look healthy, and shiny. I actually like this much better than the original &#34;It's a 10 Miracle Leave in Spray&#34;. with that product, it was too heavy to spray on my hair so I'd squirt some in my hands, rub them together and style as usual&#34;.<br />I wish this stuff would have been around 13yrs ago when I had (horrible frizzy) hair down to my tailbone, I don't think I would have chopped off as much because this stuff really transforms your hair.
B0052XVKPO|4|Great variety of colors, look great blended together for unique & custom looks. I've had mine about a year now and still love it, though some of the colors are just beginning to wear out (I am a light makeup-wearer).
B002QFGQAK|5|I just got i had never used before but it covers very good. I have to practice more of how to use it.
B0007W1R58|5|It just feels so great on my skin and truly believe it keeps my skin soft and firm.  I have used this for quite a while.  Love this product!
B00R5CGZH8|5|Great quality! Exceeded my expectations
B00AE07FUE|5|Salon Quality is exactly what you will be getting. This will deep clean your hair and get rid of smoke, dirt, and grime as well as sweat. I like the way my hair feels after using this shampoo. It feels great and makes your hair look like a million bucks. It makes it easy to manage as well as can be used on any hair style as well. Leaves your hair clean and smelling great. Another great product from  Nexxus.
B00336EUTK|4|Ok, I don't write a lot of reviews, so when I do, I mean it!  This stuff works great! I have only done one strip so far, and it works very, very well.  No discomfort whatsoever.  I can't wait to see the results after 7 or 10 days.  The first time is a bit strange to put on the teeth, but you'll get use to it. Good luck
B000TKH6BC|5|I have wavy blonde hair that gets frizzy easily. This seems to make the curls for defined so I can wear my hair naturally. I have never found anything similar to it that I liked.
B00T9VMHZ2|5|I read that salt baths could help with muscle pains and I honestly was skeptical to rely on anything other than advil or ointments.  I tried a 20 minute soak and felt my muscles completely relax!  I used a full cup but I plan on using less next time.
B0067LR21Q|3|This product is ok but way too thick. It doesn't rub very smoothly. I bought Burnout Kids and I like that much better.
B00JH7OZ2G|4|Love it!  Its perfect. Cant wait to fill it with amazing color lipsticks.
B001E7BDIQ|5|I love goat's milk soap!  My skin dries out with any other soap or body wash.  I've noticed a remarkable difference in my skin since I started using this soap.  I use it on my face and notice that my skin tone is more even; I don't need to cover my face with makeup.  Also, it is long lasting and economical.  Love it!
B005BEF5EQ|5|This is grat stuff that is light and non greasy.  Most products of this type will quickly weigh my hair down and make it look greasy.  An added bonus besides working well is that it has a fabulous, soft, lovely scent.
B0076K07DC|5|I really love this product, especially during the winter. I ordered the small tube of Lucas pawpa to see what the hype was all about, I had to try it. It's great on your hands, face and chapped lips a real multipurpose ointment. I must say that I'll be pruchasing a large jar the next time. Great product..
B0036FTEVC|5|I love this stuff didn't expect a big bottle when it came in but love the size! Will be buying this agein when i run out!
B00B1TKY8C|5|Great little brush,  Nice looking handle and the bristles are very well secured to it.
B0002M657I|5|I used to frost my own hair but now I have health issues so I bring them to the beauty shop for them to frost my hair.  They are long lasting, at first they are a bit large but we cut away the excess and the more its used it conforms more to your skull.  It comes with a crochet hook, we use the small one and a larger one occasionally.  It said they were almost out so I bought them all, they will probably last longer than me
B00DSJ3QEW|1|This backpack looked pretty online, but we were very disappointed with it.  The backpack ripped within 2 weeks; this is the cheapest quality item I've purchased in a long time.
B003FBK9YS|5|Super value over what you pay in the salon or big box stores
B004VCH51A|1|Looks pretty but does not go onto eyes. Brush to small, more like novelty makeup then actual makeuo.
B00CIGZE78|3|It works decent, just not what I expected.
B000V321BM|4|It's ok.
B00PATJXFE|3|Some of the features and pros are as follows:- 1) The body wash is made with fragrance release pearls. 2) The fragrance is of scarlet roses and berries. 3) It moisturizes my skin considerably well.  Cons:- 1) The fragrance last for a few hours and then wears off. It does not last all day long as claimed. 2) The scent is kind of strong and could have allergic reactions for people with asthma. 3) The color of the body wash is burgundy red which is not very pleasant for the eyes.
B008BHE3E8|5|I love, love this product.  I see a noticeable difference after only using it 2 weeks.  My skin appears much brighter with less appearance of my pores and my skin has indeed tightened.  I have finally found the product that will become a part of my beauty regiment.  I will no longer purchase any other brand from a drug store.  Thank you for creating a product that really works.
B002AB67TU|5|I received this item as a gift for my birthday this year and to my surprise, being really picky about my perfumes I am truly enjoying this one. I prefer fresh smells mostly, depends of the season too, so this eau-de-toilette spray is a fresh to sweet interesting aroma which is great for the cold season in my opinion. It also stays on for long hours, which is one of the main reasons I am pleased with the product. The smell itself is somehow intense initially, but not too heavy. Enjoy it!
B0062CC3UU|5|This was a gift, and my wife loved it. She found it useful as we travelled around from hotel to hotel.
B001DYFIPY|3|I bought this for my 12 year old grandaughter to practice nail polishing and nail art on.  She uses it alot but you do have to just dig out the glue and polish with cuticle clippers.  I tried to find a hand that was easier to clean but this is the best one I could find.
B0015347LY|5|I have that T-Zone skin type of oily forehead,nose (large pores)and chin but dryer skin on my cheeks. The Dudu-Osun black soap deeply cleans and really takes care of both skin types without drying out my skin. For me, Its just the best!
B0051ZOLAO|5|My skin hasn't been clearer since I've used this face wash!
B00CO94DDK|4|love it!!!!
B004AYUW8C|5|My husband smells yummy because of this!  Sometimes I use it when he is not looking!
B006W2SYF8|4|Awesome razor, no complains. Gives a close, comfortable shave.<br /><br />I'm going to take one star off for the cradle design, though. Considering where the charging cable plugs in (bottom rear), the cradle becomes unstable and doesn't hold the razor tight enough.<br /><br />As to shipping, Amazon rocks as always! It took them almost a week to get the razor out the door, but they shipped it overnight! Five starts to Amazon.
B002RXW5BA|5|You just can't go wrong with this set.  I love most Shany products, and this set is one of the best! I'm fussy about my makeup, and I use a lot of MAC, because their makeup is very pigmented, allowing you to use less makeup, and it stays on longer.  For the price of this Shany set, I didn't expect MAC quality, but I was very pleasantly surprised.  The colors are beautiful, it affords you a wide variety of colors to create many different looks, and the pigment is very rich...you don't need to use much to get the look you want.  I highly recommend to anyone who enjoys creating and wearing a variety of looks.  This deal LOOKS too good to be true, but believe me...it really is a great deal for a wonderful product!!  Don't hesitate to buy!
B0039LMTA6|5|I love this product!  I use it all year round and I never have to use lotion.  It's fabulous and I hightly recommend it!
B003TTEHH6|5|I recently purchased this product for the first time and I think the product is pretty good. The bottle says &#34;Results in Two Weeks&#34; and so far I definitely noticed a lot less hair breakage within a very short time period of using the product but I'm not sure about the hair growth yet.  My guess is that if the breakage has stopped then the next step is hair growth but it's only been a couple weeks so it's a bit too early to tell.  I am trying to &#34;go natural&#34; and so far, the Virgin Hair Fertilizer Deep Conditioner and Miss Jessie's Sweetback Deep Conditioner are my favorites (I rotate between both products during every other hair wash).  Overall, I would purchase both products again and I would recommend either of the products. The only downside is that both deep conditioners contain Dimethicone which is not the greatest ingredient for hair health, however I've noticed that most conditioners contain that ingredient, so I guess I can work with that.
B00170E31Y|5|This is my absolute favorite body wash and has been for years.  It is made of only the purest, most natural ingredients (as are all of the Nubian Heritage products), and it works amazingly.  I believe it is the honey in it that makes it cling to the skin so thickly and feel so lavish and nourishing, yet it washes away so easily and cleanly.  This body wash leaves skin feeling nourished, clean, and not stripped.  Follow with the Nubian Heritage Lavender and Wildflower body lotion or body butter.  The Lavender and Wildflower scent is my absolute favorite, but all of the Nubian Heritage are wonderful.  I don't know how they make something so pure that is so fragrant, but they manage it.  The smell is absolutely intoxicating.  I love it!
B00IH1DJGG|2|These are sub par lip liners. The price is right, but they are difficult to apply and not very creamy. They also are a bit  drying. Not a bad range of colors, although many of them are quite dark. You can also use them as difficult to apply eye liners. . .If you are looking for an inexpensive lip liner I would buy the NYX lip liners, retractable or pencil. They are still budget friendly and apply much better.
B00JVZJXKI|5|Just resived mine(:<br />Fast shipping(:<br />Exactly as seen in the picture, even tho the &#34;free gift&#34; is really small!<br />It's half the size of my pinky but over all I'm very happy with my purchase
B001MW4W0Y|4|This product can cake very easily, so be careful! And I find it lasts longer when covered with a finishing powder. It has great coverage though!
B001SERK9G|1|The first one I purchasrd worked well 2 yrs ago, when it died not quite a yr later I replaced it with a 2nd it lasted 3 mos. I thought.. maybe there was a defect, so like a dummy, I ordered a 3rd one .. a month and a half later it died!<br />Don't waste your money! It's cheap. The price is right, when it works it does a good job, but if you want a facebrush that's disposable go to your local drugstore.<br />I've replaced it with NutraSonic it does a great job, nice size for the shower, even feels like it has substance and comes in a travel bag. By the way if you're wonding why I didn't just buy the Clairsonic I have didn't like it & too expensive.
B00COLG980|5|Well made. Excellent.
B002RT71UO|5|I don't like product in my hair but this stuff is good.  It does what is supposed to but my hair isn't stiff.
B00GP2OELI|4|Trick - cut the eye tattoos in half and do the top, then the bottom.  Honestly it's kind of a mess with your eyebrows, but mine stuck and looked fine even when they overlapped my eyebrows.  I got the nose heart on a little crooked, but since it's outlined in black, I was able to fix it with black eyeliner.  These tattoos were a lot of fun, I got a lot of compliments, and I'd definitely recommend them.  Just take your time and don't accidentally get the sheet wet before it's on your face.
B002RCBHYM|5|This product is a great product, especially for naturalista's.
B008BC74US|4|I bought this nail polish remover hoping to replace the regular ones that you can get from drug store. This polish remover able to remove nail polish. Although it is not like the regular $3.99 which remove the polish right away, it doesn't take that much longer to have my nail polish removed, especially this product is natural, I think I am going to stay with this even after my baby is born.
B002LHITWG|5|the moisture recovery leaves my hair feeling so soft.  Tried the KPak from Joico but did not do the joy that the moisture recovery does.  My hair is frizzy, very dry, coarse and thick.  Even after shampooing it feels soft. Top it off with conditioner and balm and I am good to go.
B002VBZF4W|5|Soft and natural looking results.  has excellent staying power.  Among my favorite Mally products.  great for greying, patchy brows, too.
B0000AFUT3|2|I was setting up the mirror to put on my makeup and the piece that holds the stand up broke off into pieces so now I have to prop the mirror up in order to see into it.  I think the material is very cheap.  This should not have happened.  Now I have to go and research another mirror other than this one!
B000NL0T1G|5|I'm not sure if this razor is better or worse than any other one, but it's sturdy, and since it's so simple, that's probably the only thing that really matters. Considering they're so simple, I'm not sure why they're all $30+, but with razors costing a few cents each, I can't really complain. This thing will probably last your whole life, so cost probably isn't that big of a deal.
B00937VAQE|2|Didn't do much for my hair. Just seemed to weigh it down. Ended up just using it as shower soap. Worked great for that purpose. It disappears rather quickly. I expected a lot more from it because of the price and all the great reviews. For me it was just sort of a waste of money. I wouldn't buy it again.
B0050QM1BK|5|this brush is awesome, i have crazy thick hair and ruin brushes easily, but this one is great and it is so pretty!
B000EGOFD8|5|How easy this product is to use. At first look at the instructions I was a little worried that it was going to be too complicated. It was so easy and looked like a professional manicure. Even my daughter couldn't tell the difference. This really helps me with my constant splitting nail that has been splitting since I was a little kid. Love this product, you will too.
B0040QY2ZY|3|I had been after some of this soap since visiting a hammam in France. The black soap they used there was like a holy miracle for my skin. I chose this soap because it somehow seemed like the most &#34;authentic&#34;. Whatever. It smells nasty and has a tar-like feel. I suppose it works alright, but it's no miracle. I have pretty sensitive skin - eczema & rosacea and it didn't irritate. It does burn if you have any cuts. I'd say spend your $$ on a different cleanser.<br /><br />Here are the ingredients:<br />Potassium olivate, water, sodium, sodium hydroxide
B0000535UM|5|Very happy with product. I would recommend to everyone.
B000WHYATS|5|It really works great, though be careful not to push too hard.
B00I56J4V2|5|Really beautiful!  Works well even if you don't have a lot of hair.
B0012J30LY|2|I only use Olay facial products. This one just doesn't seem to do what the others do. In fact I've had breakouts since I started using it. I've gone back to the regular moisturizer. The seller was great though!
B002LC5R08|5|This product is used in the finest hotels.  I have it in every bathroom in my house.  Also my kitchen.  The handcream is great also.
B00UMUM9BQ|5|This is not a mascara folks. It is a serum that you apply similar to eye liner. You only apply it to your upper eyelids and the product is virtually invisible. It is designed to help with hair growth. Other products that have you apply like mascara are pretty much a waste because they do not get into the hair follicles. This does get into the hair follicles.
B00006IV3C|5|This water jet is excellent.  It allows you to have a separate chamber for water and mouthwash.  It also comes with different attachments for your gums, teeth and tongue.  Excellent product at an excellent price!
B000SMXK5C|5|I found this amazing sponge while searching the net for the flocked sponges I had been using for sometime. After using this \\"pink egg\\" for well over a month, I won't be returning to the traditional methods ever again! Using this sponge in the prescribed \\"bouncing\\" motion (either wet or dry) provides an unusually even, natural, and flawless finish, which I never achieved using sponges, brushes or my finger tips. I especially like the sponge's smooth, suede texture and egg shape (the narrow end is great for around the eyes and nose, while the larger end provides for even application on the cheeks, forhead and chin). I no longer worry about \\"streaks\\" and \\"blotches\\" in my foundation! The other sponges I've used seemed to \\"soak up\\" an excessive amount of foundation, which either remainded in the sponge (to be washed out or thown away with the sponge) or ended up as streaks in my foundation. The BeautyBlender does not soak up excessive amounts of foundation so I no longer waste expensive foundations.<br /><br />It cleans well and is said to last a long time; which given its rather hefty price for a makeup applicator is a plus! After more than a month of daily use, mine shows no signs of wear, and when it does, I'll gladly purchase another!<br /><br />If you are searching for an easy to use foundation applicator and a professional finish, this product makes good on its promises! The BeautyBlender website states that it is the \\"ultimate make up sponge applicator\\".... and, I think they are right!!!
B0016KARKQ|5|The best shampoo and the conditioner,  they give you the shine you are looking for!
B004HFEOEM|5|I have switched my entire skin care line to Alba but since their shipping fees on their website are high I always try to get them somewhere with more reasonable prices. I have not used this eye make up remover before. I have had generic drug store brands which would leave my eye area very oily and greasy but since they were doing  a good job, I'd be OK with washing my eyes with soap afterwards. Well after trying other products buy Alba and falling in love with them I decided to give a shot to this eye makeup remover. I absolutely LOVE it! It's SO gentle on the eye area yet it instantly removes all the makeup without you having to go back and forth multiple times clean everything up. No oil and grease residue afterwards, I can literally just clean off the makeup and go without washing my eyes afterwards. I will definitely continue using this eye makeup remover as long as it remains as awesome as it is right now
B007V6237Y|5|regular on/off buyer  .. like the product
B003E0Y3WY|5|GREAT PRODUCT, definitely would recommend this product to anyone, very light, not too oily!! Moisturizing
B00DLAY0LQ|5|These are my favorite hairbrushes of all time
B003QSMID0|5|As expected.
B00AHUCQWS|4|It arrived about four days sooner than estimated, which still means it took 20 days total.  They included a free wig cap (black), which was a pleasant surprise, even though I don't need it.  The wig kind of squished in the bag, but it kept more of the curl than I was expecting.  The bangs were tricky to get smoothed out, but hey, so are real bangs.<br /><br />The actual strands are nice and soft.  Fits comfortably enough--the inner loops to adjust it are stitched over, but tightening it to where I could ended up perfect for me (my hair is buzzed, so if you're piling hair underneath, you may not even need to tighten it).<br /><br />Not an amazing product, but definitely worth the twelve dollars I paid for it.  I added a photo.
B00HX5GUE0|2|Perfume isn't as good in the bottle as it was in the ad.  Don't buy.
B00012WYLK|5|This perfume smells soooo good.  It is a perfect fragrance for a hot summer day - very fresh and light.  I LOVE it!
B00HE1GYD0|4|This is a great basic facial serum - works well at softening skin - the price was very reasonable!
B0036JJJLI|5|This is my 4th purchase of this serum. It changed the way I look at skin care products.  I am 32 with combination skin prone to acne, and my brother (in his early 20s) gets severe acne. We both now use it and are happier with this product than anything else we have ever used. It's healing, soothing, anti-inflammatory, and anti-bacterial.    I rub a little into my fingertips and gently massage into the acne-prone areas right after showering, about 3-4 times a week. I then apply a little moisturizer onto any areas that get dry (forehead, around the mouth, etc.) and let it all absorb while I style my hair.  By the time I'm ready to put on makeup my skin is supple, even, and radiant.  Blemishes are able to heal, and since my skin is less irritated I'm not tempted to touch my face during the day.    LOL @ the reviewer who says this makes their skin feel oily.  Seriously though, it's made of high-quality oils that absorb into your skin if you give it a few minutes.  You might be using too much.    Whether you think natural ingredients make a difference or not, the proof is in the results. These ingredients are organic (no sprays, dyes, or unnatural preservatives) and 100% plant-derived.  Essential oils have been used for centuries and have very few side effects when used correctly.    If you get bad breakouts I also highly recommend the face wash by Thesis called Daily Harmony.  It's strong so I don't recommend daily use though, as the name suggests.  Try 2-3 times a week to avoid complete dry-out (which can cause more breakouts).    I've been getting compliments for my skin lately, which I've never gotten in my whole life.  Thesis nailed it with this one.  I wish they sold bottles twice this size.
B005UKZAJG|3|It's not as big as it looks the case was broke but the makeup product is great it works well and it has a lot of stuff to experiment
B002V1KHZ4|5|I normally do not write Amazon reviews. What I think has normally already been said. However, the many negative reviews about this product prompted me. My husband has an Oster clipper he bought in 1999 (yes, he still has the receipt with the item, lol). I recently decided I was talented enough to cut his hair (it took me like a year to convince him). We used the longest guide he already owned, but it basically gave him a buzzcut (not my fault, I did a great job!). Anyway, we decided with longer guides I could cut his hair just like a professional and decided to invest in some. Now, we do not like to go store-to-store looking for things (Amazon Prime anyone?). This was one of the cheaper ones on Amazon, so we went with it. They work great. The longest one was even longer than how he wanted his hair, so there are many different style possibilities here. These fit EXACTLY like the guides that originally came with the product. I highly recommend this product. Just make sure you have the right clippers before you buy it. His clipper just says \\"Oster Adjustable Professional Clippers\\". Good luck!
B001PHHUMI|3|the only reason I gave it 3 stars is because it is awkward to hold and if you compare the size of the blow dryer with the size of the cord, it is rediculous.  The blow dryer is not that big but the cord is really thick and really long.  Probably good for a hair stylist but for home it makes it harder to store.  otherwise, my curls love this dryer.
B00CD1QU80|5|The head comes apart to clean easy and there is a company that makes a kit to sharpen it. My first one lasted me almost ten years. I bought the first one at Andrews AFB, and it died while deployed to Iraq.
B00253NTCQ|3|do not smell long wonder if its the real one or simply old.
B004UE9SAU|3|Just great, very powerful. Just the right size for our sink, doesn't take up much space. Hope it last as long as my first,( was Conair Interplak Classic Dental Waterjet, which still ok, but the presser is done.)  This one I will buy again. Now update, had now for 1 and 3 months, and it's done. I was hoping would make it til March when I get my braces out, which would of been great, that why i really needed for. I would if just, buy after later. My husband hated it. Lol This one is good for if you just want to have one, to use once in a while. If you want one for long run, pay a little more. All and all it was ok.
B004LV82JU|1|I was so excited to purchase this item, as I have tried many products. I have not a missed a day of taking the daily dose 2 tablespoons.  Unfornatly I have not seen any difference in my hair growth or condition of my hair. I eat clean and drink plenty of water and have found that Biotin 5000mg is really the best way to go and a third of the price.  Do not waste your money, eat healthy and lots of protein that is the key to good hair and good skin. Good luck!
B004NMR6TY|5|I am absolutely AMAZED at. One of the main reasons I had waist length hair for so long is the maintenance of layered hair and the cost of forking out $50 monthly for a maintenance cut !!!! Plus the only time I even LET anyone TOUCH my hair in the 1st place was because she cut Daryl Hanna's hair. Now this thing floored me when I was just planning to trim it and the inches turned into feet, and only took 20 min!!!!!  My hair is about .5 inches past my shoulders now, total wash and wear but stylishly layered. I can wear different hairstyles,  put it up in summer and when I swim, I could buy a salon with the $ I save on product and recuts. I just wish I would have thought of it. Comes with a DVD but you don't really need it as you tube has about 15 videos on it. WoW!! and pays for itself the first time you use it!! .....
B001CT06FW|5|I first smelled this perfume on an acquaintance and later tried to buy it for my wife in several department stores. I was told there was no such perfume by the name of L'instant. Frustrated, I decided to check online. It had just never occurred to me to buy perfume through the Internet. Duh. This is the third bottle I've ordered in three years. It's just about the only perfume my wife wears.
B000MGSJBY|5|I use a lot of essential oils and this one in particular I use for an air freshener.  I mix it with water and put in a spray bottle....works better than any other purchased air freshener without all the chemicals.  Great product.
B0092OI6J2|5|Love my perfume. Very quick delivery
B000PR44A0|5|Love this mask. leaves skin feeling soft and smooth.  Like a facial every time!  Worth every penny!
B00BB5YFEU|5|It is a kosher ready shaver and very good shaver too ! It is difficult find one like this , great
B00OZAO5IY|5|Good experience will order again
B0077LAJT2|5|Awsome blades the best out there. Makes for a clean shave with no problems what so ever, it's just a 5 start product.
B00137BEHW|5|I had finger surgery and use this as part of my life log Physical therapy, i keep several around the best thing when clay isn't appropriate.
B008CC3SMK|5|I am lucky I got to try Secret Outlast gel for free through a Bzzagent campaign for Secret! I was incredibly skeptical to use a gel deodorant because I've had stain issues in the past and because I am a chef. To my surprise it went on easy(dries quick too), lasted a long hot day without leaving grody looking stains on my shirt and I Did Not Stink!! One to one and a half click is all you need and you're good for the whole day!! I totally recommend this deodorant to any hard working hard sweating woman! Did I mention it smells good?? That is always a plus in my book :)<br /><br />All the opinions I have given are My Own.
B008YEMWOG|4|good for the price
B001VCUQE6|5|My husband says these are great blades. He told me he wants me to reorder them next time he needs blades.
B000SKHGIQ|2|I have very thick hair I saw such great reviews but It was so dainty and thin. It would be great for someone with thinner hair. But if you have thick hair best bet is to think about if you really want this item. I still have it but dont use it at all.
B00FOAPENE|5|Beautiful color! I bought it for fall, but don't see why I can't wear it other times of the year. KBShimmer is one of my favorite brands of nail polish. It stays on for days without chipping, the colors are unique, and customer service is always outstanding!
B00LM0L3JO|1|Very uncomfortable.
B0006OU078|4|Expensive and the picture showed 2 brushes<br />But the product is fine
B0011MQ0TQ|5|like the title said, it smells pretty fantastic. I do suggest burning a half stick if you're gonna be in a small room, because dang, its powerful. it certainly helps to cover up the way your place normally smells.
B007RYSY5A|1|I purchased this on the phone a few weeks ago for $10.00 plus shipping and handling.  I thought it would be fun for a little mom and daughter bonding time. It came with a \\"bonus\\" french tip disc and a small manicure kit.  What they don't tell you is that you have to pay for the shipping and handling for the free \\"bonus\\" items.  My $10.00 + shipping and handling came to $23.98.  They do not give you option of not accepting the \\"free\\" items or tell you that you will be paying shipping and handling twice, but they do try to sell you about 10 different other things while you are on the phone (magazine subsciptions...) The quality is poor and doesn't work.  I called to complain, but got no success in having the extra charges removed.  I told the representative that I felt sorry that she works for such an unethical business...
B00N225RG0|5|I love this hand soap.  The bottle looks great in my guest bathroom, as do the other bathrooms. The soap is made of wonderful ingredients and your hands will be soft and healthy. The scent is minimal and no after smell on your hands.
B00MARDFJ4|3|Can't see a difference..
B00NIZYY10|5|This hair spray was recommended by my hair dresser.  I have some crazy frizzy/medium curly hair and this hair spray is the best one I have ever tried.  I am not a big hair products person but I will say I feel this item is worth the 25-30 dollar price tag.  The 13 ounce size lasts me 1 year.  I use it to smooth down my  hair after I put it up and I also use it to lock in my look after I straighten it.  As other reviewers have noted, the light scent is very nice and it doesn't feel like crusty glue in your hair.
B003VV47UE|5|Great shampoo. Makes my hair feel and smell great. No need for conditioner. Great shine and manageability. Love this shampoo
B007C27HAA|5|Been wearing it for two year now and I love it!! A little pricey, but it last all day long.
B0094GHJI2|2|If you are going to buy a less expensive mascara I would buy the 2 step Lorreal, it really extends the lashes and comes right off.
B0032VHD5E|2|I have tried this product on and off for several months, and simply don't like it. It doesn't seem to make a difference at all in my nail strength or length.<br /><br />The worst part is that it does not last at all. I don't put any color over it, sometimes I will try putting a top coat. No matter what, no matter how many coats or top coats, it always flakes off quickly and looks nasty. The longest I can usually go without re-doing it is 2 days. Overall, a pointless product.
B00622KU7S|3|nice replacement for my broken onel
B004D1PPKC|1|I wish that I could give this product more than 1 star, because the color itself looks good (since I dye my hair black, there weren't any issues with the results coming out darker than expected), but oh my goodness does this stuff stink! It smells like stale, cheap beer, and I have been queasy ever since it first touched my hair! I'll definitely be sticking with the gel.
B007D4TB7O|5|the container is great - rather unique after you remove the top a small brush - which makes application a cinch - lovely color I will buy  more in various colors  THIS IS A GREAT ITEM
B000GGG07K|5|Works great
B00143WR94|5|Hard to find grey hair nets were exactly what my 81 y/o mother had been looking for.  The hair nets are a fine mesh and keeps the hair in place and the nets are practicality invisible.  Thank you Amazon for having them and so easy to purchase.
B00KV77U1O|5|Good
B00V3T10NS|5|Sank makes amazing products. This is another great one in their series.
B0072FTOW6|5|Love this! It leaves my skin so soft and it really does kill the shine! I have very oily skin and have tried so many things so I was so glad this works! The shine killer has the same texture of pore filler and it's clear.
B002Q7Z1ZO|5|pretty!
B002TXDW1A|1|It gives my nails a nice shiny look even though I'm a dude. I wouldn't mind if the treatment tasted gross and kept me from chewing on my fingers subconsciously. I bit my nails down further than usual. Overpriced cheap nail polish. This product is a scam. Don't waste money on it plus shipping.
B00I6AL31Q|5|I love magic lipstick :)excellent thank you amazon :)
B005P0RV8O|3|Cant be used for babies under 6 months without doctor advice.  Very thick cream, seems to saturate fairly well.
B0092KGYEA|1|I had to re do my review I received this package way before the estimated date so that was a plus. I just used this product yesterday and the acrylic powder/liquid BURNS 🔥so I had to go to my local store and buy another brand, the nail file is super weak, the glue is sticky and their isn't enough powder or liquid. I will NOT order from this seller again. Great starter and practice kit though.
B00GBJWBZQ|5|Verdesol is fantastic!  Growing up my family always had this around but for years now we have been unable to locate it in the stores. It is absolutely the best if you have any pain in your mouth (bite your cheek).  I purchased three bottles to share with my family!<br />THANK YOU!
B003705E9M|4|Hubby says it works!
B0006O4PMY|5|I discovered this fragrance seversl months ago and I love it - so fresh, clean and will never use anything else.
B008H4MCUW|5|wonderful product! very good in curly hair :)
B00XILUEVI|5|This works very nice and even feels good.It holds easy in my hand.
B007XJ394A|5|First time I used this was at a professional manicure salon.  Never felt anything like it.  I just had to find it.  Of course I looked on Amazon..........and of course found it.  Great product.<br /><br />Diane - Raynham MA
B004YM7E68|3|First off this 2oz bottle is usually a part of a `free gift' at Lancome in fact right now (May 2011) you can get 6 free gifts including the 2oz tube of Flash bronzer leg gel when you purchase $32 worth of Lancome stuff.  Which is how it came to be in my possession.  I usually only review books, but it is summer and the season for tanning.  I am as pale as they come (I mean red-head pale) so unfortunately a lot of self tanners look orange on me.  I also don't believe in tanning beds and rarely have time to go to the pool.<br /><br />Look and feel<br />The tanner is a gelly substance that has flecks of gold glitter on it so I really liked using it when I was wearing shorts/skirt/dress.  It goes on smoothly and you really don't need too much.<br /><br />Smell<br />The gel had a strong smell at first, but it didn't smell like fake bake, after a few hours the smell was still there but it did not intensify like some tanners do.  It wasn't unpleasant, but certainly distinguishable.<br /><br />Immediate look<br />My legs looked shimmery and maybe a half a shade darker immediately<br /><br />3-4 hours later<br />My legs had an orange bronze look to them (like burnt orange not vivid orange) on my feet... which yes I had exfoliated and moisturized before putting this on.<br /><br />Final conclusion<br />I have friends that love this stuff, they are slightly darker then I am and have never experienced the orange problem, this is probably due to how pale I am normally, I have this problem with a lot of sunless tanners.  The big point for me though is that it wasn't a horrid noticeable orange, I didn't feel embarrassed since I was wearing a skirt, in fact I'm sure I was the only one who was looking closely enough to notice it, still for the hefty price tag it wasn't a perfect fit for me.
B00BIDFQY8|3|The listing says that the designs include &#34;Dragonflies, Hearts, Flowers, Animals, Butterflies, Fruits, Cupcakes, Bows&#34; I was hoping to get exactly what was pictured! It wasn't the same, which is okay but sorta disappointing because some aren't all that great. I was really hoping to get the bows!<br /><br />What was in my package: Peacock feathers, starts, fruits/misc animals, hearts, and butterflies, animals, butterflies/dragonflies, fruits, smiley faces, and hearts.<br /><br />The cuts are awesomely thin, which is great because cutting them from the sticks isn't that easy if you want them super thin. I also don't like the total 3d look, these will work awesome sealed into a no chip manicure and some of them are very detailed (butterflies, flowers, and animals).<br /><br />All in all, still a great purchase, and once you get this set you probably won't need to get anymore, these will last a while!
B001GIOV14|5|I really appreciate this nontoxic lipstick. It's small and lightweight so can be easily carried in a pocket. I find that it stays on a long time, too.<br /><br />Susan Schenck, author of The Live Food Factor: The Comprehensive Guide to the Ultimate Diet for Body, Mind, Spirit & Planet<br />and<br />Beyond Broccoli, Creating a Biologically Balanced Diet When a Vegetarian Diet Doesn't Work<br />and<br />Expats in Cuenca, Ecuador: The Magic & the Madness
B0009JMB6I|5|this is exactly what I was looking for. I have really fine hair so I dont know how it will work on thick hair , but I love mine and wouldn't trade it for the world.
B000E7SSGC|5|It was for a present. My friend like it very much.<br />Paco Rabanne XS has several years in the market but still a good option.
B00FQ8OQZ6|2|Poor quality.  During first use the pad left bits of fluff all over my face.  I would not purchase again.
B000PVUAI6|5|Love the smell and the clean yet not dry feeling it leaves my skin! It has a thick more like gel texture, but lathers really well. The bottle is a good size too. Plus the product came pretty quick!
B00DG740RI|2|Overly complicated and as such was not used. Will give it to someone who has the time and the trial and error mentality.
B00NP10W5O|4|Very cute and effective. A little thinner than I'd like (meterial wise). I work 2nd shift, so this is useful for the mornings when I'm still asleep.
B00AFBSIPI|5|good
B000O2OIMK|5|Great hairspray for a natural hold for fine hair. Not sticky or heavy or stiff.
B0078TK0YW|3|I really purchased the wrong one.I should have purchased the one with coconut oil. I will have to mix it in.
B00IT6PJ44|5|Excellent.
B00LNE6Q0A|5|Liked them very much.  Good price, and fast delivery
B00S31Q5RU|5|Love it
B003B3OKQ8|1|This is by far the worst tasting toothpaste I have ever tried.  Cleans no better than other alternatives available here at Amazon.
B00KHH2VOY|5|I have tried the mud soap & liked it a lot, but WOW, I love this soap! It is perfect for my skin!
B0001MROQA|5|I have been using the Hot Tools curling iron for years and I love the way it heats up and curls my hair.
B007TG9RG6|5|Love this dotting tool set the picture is pink but my dotting tools look exactly like the picture but its blue. Also incase you didn't know the some sizes repeat. Came faster than I expected!
B00EMAM9BC|5|This is my fav cheap mascara. A must! Thank you!
B0039NMCPG|5|I have been using this now for the past couple of weeks and am very pleased with the results.  My skin seems so much smoother with noticeable reduction in the appearance of wrinkles!  I love it.
B00ETJK09E|5|Valentines Day gift for my husband. He loves it & so do I.
B001KB0U2Q|3|Thought it was going to be a little bigger, but its not. Very small.
B00016XJ4M|5|Cool!
B007ISRNJS|5|Works amazingly!!! I can curl my shoulder length hair that is thick in 20-25 minutes with this!!
B0001EKTZQ|5|I have used dermalogica since I was in my mid 20's.  I am in my mid 30's and don't plan to stop!
B004BASOI0|1|I was hoping for better quality - but you get what you pay for.  The bristles in the nail brush are very wimpy and after a few uses are flattened and falling out.  The foot file came off and I had to reglue it.  It may last for a year tops, then I will be looking for a better quality product.  It is handy to have all four features in one item, but I will be looking for a foot brush that will last.
B00KVOR9VI|5|Purchased for my husband.  He loves it!  Great quality.
B000T7P0KO|4|I am 65 years old and I like this cream.  I use it starting in fall to help my face after a long summer in the sun.  I think it makes my complexion better.
B0050QJ1HM|1|It's the worst curling iron I have ever bought. It never worked after the first time. Never heated again. Don't waste your money.
B00IPLXY4U|5|Makes great lather, good price, but it!
B000GG5V3Y|5|This is what sets this powder apart from others there is NO SMELL! It does not clash with anything. Works fine too.
B0018A32XS|5|Do not expect a super close shave....it is an electric razor after all....not as close as a blade...BUT, I take this on week-long trips and I never bring the charger. It works on day 7 as well as day one. Although it is not a super close shave by feel, it is close enough to wear shorts without seeing any stubble.<br />If you use it daily, it works great....if you wait a week and have longer hair....it does pull and hurt a bit.
B001VA8PWI|5|I'm so in love with this product. i mean i've been seeing it on the shelves and I've read some good reviews about mineral products but to try it on was something different.<br />Even my beauty consultant didn't believe i wasn't wearing a cream foundation! its so light on the skin, easy to create the exact tone you feel like appearing into every morning and cover the pores very naturally.
B00TSTZQEY|4|Nice scent. I plan to use this for several different applications, including making a sugar scrub, skin lotion, and room spray.
B0020MMCJI|5|Has a good fragrance and doesn't bothers people around, because the odor is nice and soft. And best of all is the price, a lot of liquid at a low cost.
B0043OWJG2|5|This whole machine is a little smaller than I was expecting but ir work fine and these replacement head are EASY to swap on and off.
B000GZD1JG|5|Yes I have a short hair cut and I can dry and curl it at the same time. It is easy. I do say it works for short hair not sure about long? It just take a few minutes and my hair does not stick out and look messy from sleeping.
B0012RQXTC|5|Great price on this item! Exactly same as product in local beauty store, but half the cost here. Will definitely buy again!
B00D7BNGQO|3|Honestly, don't waste your money on this, i was so happy once it got it. BUT it was a great disappointment to me, my lashes came out very clumpy and stayed thin, they didn't get any volume. The only thing i like about is the lower lash brush, that works better than the top. So i don't recomend it, it might not work for me because i have semi- long/full lashes but i dont know, i just didnt enjoy it.
B006K25ZYI|5|Product arrived just when it said it would. I ordered this for my best friend for our cruise to The Bahamas, she was out. Her stylist began using this on her very curly hair about a year ago. Shortly after she bought the same products for herself at home. DevaCurl is hands down the best product line for curly hair! My friend used this on her hair on the humid weather of the Bahamas and had zero frizz!
B000VOLM3Y|5|This is my favorite perfume that is discontinued. I am so glad found it online!!! I totally recommend this company for their service.
B002WTC3D4|5|The new variation of this is Smooth Lock.  It's not the same, although my local salon insisted that it was.  Just looking at a drop in your hands you can see a big difference.  &#34;Smooth Down&#34; leaves a much nicer finish to my fine/dry, slightly naturally curly hair.  I'm super bummed that Redken changed the formula.
B000W8JZJ2|5|I have tried everything there is so my acne and everything always dried my skin out and didn't work. This, it does dry my skin out but IT WORKS! When I have break outs I use this for about 3-4 days and my face is cleared up. I get no new break outs and I eventually stop using it until my face gets out of control again.
B009PPFT2K|5|I am now a fan of this product. Didnt quite get it from amazon because I was kind of in a hurry but my future orders will be because you save more money than the actual pharmacy. However, bought it yesterday along with the effaclar anti-shine moisturizer and am telling you it's an overnight miracle. The funny part about this is I had to find out on my own that I had mild rosacea and finally God has allowed to find the promise land. I recommend this to anyone whether mild or blown rosacea this is your best BET!!!!
B001UE7D2I|2|This hairdryer doesn't have enough oomph to get the job done.  It needs more power to blow air.  It is frustrating to dry my hair with it.
B0029U0Z1S|5|I have been using this shaving set for several months and it gives me a good shave.  The handle is heavy and has a good feel to it and the bristles are full.  The shaving soap cup seems to be durable and has not shown any signs of tarnish despite being constantly exposed to water.  The only drawback is the small size of the shaving soap bowl.  I had to cut down the size of the shaving soap to fit it into the bowl, losing about 25 percent of the soap.
B00L97H22C|5|Purchased this for my Husband for our 21st wedding anniversary.  He was delighted and so was I.
B00GDG4W68|1|This will be the last time I order with out smelling first , I ordered it before smelling and then smelled it in  at macys . I love Eau Fraiche  but was so disappointed it smells is not crisp it is more like a winter smell I had to wash it off after I put it on I was very disappointed
B00PFCSURS|1|Looks different from the picture
B009G3C2HG|5|This items is amazing.
B001ET78RE|5|I love this moisturizer and have used it for years. I'm happy to be able to get a great price from Amazon.
B00DPE9EQO|5|Feels great on my face!
B001CEH5LK|5|Great aroma,sticks are premium quality.
B00GMOWYNE|5|It was a very good buy and I like the way it dispenses from the bottle.  The only thing I don't care for is its kind perfumey smell.  Its not bad, I was just surprised and would rather it had little smell as other brands do.  It works wonderfully well and I use it all the time.  I do recommend it.
B003A4HSOE|5|I've been using speed stick stainguard for years now and find that my undershirts last significantly longer than with other deodorants (before the pit stains get too bad to wear the shirts).  I was happy to find it on Amazon and have been pleased with the quality of the product.  I highly recommend Speed Stick Stainguard.
B00JLPM8AK|5|This product is amazing!  I gave it 5 Stars because it is a winner!  I saw a difference immediately and have been using it for a few months.  I'm seeing that the texture and appearance of the skin it is improving more and more over time.  It really has made a big difference in the moisture that is retained in the skin.  There was dryness and some fine lines but that has basically disappeared, this is like a Jeanie in a bottle.<br /><br />I use this in conjunction with the “100 Pure Hyaluroinc Acid Serum Acid”, “Avalon Organics” - Vitamin C renewal moisturizing skin cr&egrave;me and I also take some collagen/hyaluroinc acid - advanced formula, type 1,2 & 3 supplements by “youtheory” that work from within, this combination has really worked extremely well for me.  I believe that the natural way to maintain beauty is always the best way, and it really works.  You must give this a try first before you start trying to do other things that cost more, like going to a plastic surgeon, etc., which may not then be necessary.  This product is a bit pricey but since a little goes a long way it is much more cost effective than you would think.  At the rate I'm going, I think my bottle will last me about 5 - 6 months.<br /><br />I think you may find after using this product, that the fix was more simple than you ever thought it could be to regain the youthful element and appearance of beautiful skin, I recommend this product highly!  I already look so much younger, thank-you Serumtologie!
B0012BNVE8|1|i did not get any benefit by using this product..i order&#34; Rogaine for Men Hair Regrowth Treatment, 5%&#34; for full head but that is only for some head part.
B00UC6LKJC|5|I have only used it for a couple of weeks, but it feels nice.  The puffiness is less.  I never had dark circles, so I cannot state a thing about dark circles but the lines around my eyes are softer, but still there.
B003BMNI6M|4|More like liquid than pencil
B00F8MHMCY|5|The single best hair product I have ever used!!  I am supposed to use it about once a week or so, but I like it so much, I use it about every 2 days!!!
B0049LUI9O|4|Does its job good.
B006OZF74O|4|This is a really nice color. FTR I have pale skin with pink undertones, green eyes, and short brown hair (pixie-cut). I find that this hue complements my skin tone and eyes really nicely. It's a great summery/spring color and I wear it with a beige or light taupe color on the eyes, but I think it would transition well into fall too. I'm sure it'd look good on tanned folks as well. Here's my review...<br /><br />1) Pigmentation.<br /><br />Wow! Really great pigmentation! This is great for me because my lips are naturally very red, so lots of colors don't show up well even when I put foundation over the lips.<br /><br />2) Texture.<br />Smooth, creamy, glossy- no shimmer, thank the gods. It's kind of a cross between a highly pigmented lip balm and a chubby stick (i.e. Clinique's- which btw are way too sheer for my red lips to stand a chance). It feels really smooth and creamy on the lips. Some people might find it too heavy, especially if you're more used to sheers or lip balms. I'd say this is a great product if you're not keen on lipstick but want more color than a sheer.<br /><br />3) Color.<br /><br />The tone is, I think, best described as a light, bright peachy-orange. That's the best way to describe it. I wouldn't say, weirdly enough, that it's a 'warm' color. I'm cool-toned and it looks good! So maybe there's a bit of a blue base to it. I actually got this as a cheaper alternative to Smashbox Melondrama, which I have to say, I still really want! But this is possibly a nice, cheaper substitute even if it's not really as 'melony.'<br /><br />4) Packaging.<br />Just fine!<br /><br />Overall, I think it's a great product, really good value (at least at Target) for the product, and it'll last aaaaaages.
B004BUDK6G|5|Just got my Obsidian today so let me first say THANK YOU for the extremely fast shipping!  Ordered on Friday, received on Monday. :) Everything was perfect.    On to the product..    I used Obsidian for the first time today.  Mind you I have been tanning for 2 weeks and already have a really good base tan.  I have already used Black 20x and Luminary samples(both by Designer Skin).  The results that I got today however surpassed anything I could have hoped for.  The smell is amazing and after just once, I could tell a big difference.  My color has evened out and darkened up. I didn't feel the :heat up: like theirs have talked about and it didn't give me any tingle sensation.      Definitely would buy from this seller and again and would definitely buy Obsidian again!!
B005DHCLF2|5|The green has a strange gritty feeling to it, but it does actually glow in the dark (not bright enough to be a reading light or anything but enough to freak my husband out when he wasn't expecting it).
B0055KOCCC|5|Love
B00AFWVHI2|5|These are the best toothbrushes ive had.  They last at least 3x longer than a regular toothbrush so its worth the extra price.
B000OZZH18|5|I just recently saw an ad on amazon.com about Bold For Men and decided to give it a try. I used to shave with an alectric razor but I would get way too many ingrown hairs so the past 4 years I have switched back to shaving with a razor and gel. I have to admit I didn't like the way Bold For Men Felt on my face and how slippery it was during shaving. The cool part was that becuase it is a clear gel and doesn't have any foam, I could clearly see what areas needed to be shaved and didn't have to go over anything twice as you would with a foam gel. After the shave i couldnt believe how close the shave was and how smooth my face was. If you have never shaved with this before I have to warn you, it will feel weird at first. It's not another shaving cream, its a whole new way to shave. Once you see how great the results are you will be hooked. I would suggest trying it for a week and see how smooth your face will be. Best of all, because there is no soap, you will never get any ingrown hairs. It's definitely a Bold invention. I have heard rumors that it will be presented in an episode of Shark Tank with Marc Cuban.
B0069UAZFA|1|this does not work so please do not waste your money on this product. You will be better off using Ambi
B007JH0Y2Q|5|I always get my product on time. This is a great product.
B007Y14AWC|5|Most easy for me to use of all the floss.  Does very good job and makes it easier than string.  Not too sharp and since I have been using, much improved gum health.
B003ZA2OE2|5|I have had acne since I was 11 years old.  I am now 29 years old.  Over that time I have tried every single acne product that is over the counter and have been in and out of the dermatologist's office trying whatever the dermatologist would recommend.  Eventually I found a combination that would work which included tretinoin.  After 15 years of topical use, the tretinoin not only stopped working, but I developed acne rosacea (an unfortunate and unforeseen side effect).  I started to have horrible allergic reactions on my skin to anything with benzoyl peroxide, salicylic acid, fragrance, alcohol, and more.  So now I have acne and rosacea and no way to treat it!  The dermatologist recommended topical meds for rosacea made it worse.  After 5 years of searching for some amazing treatment that I may have overlooked, I stumbled upon Kavi skin care and the information about sulfur, acne, and rosacea.  This was it!  I have yet to use a Kavi skin care product that is ineffective.  This soap works wonders on my abundance of blackheads.  Just in the first week my skin started to purge it's pores, just like any good acne treatment it gets worse always before it gets better.  It works best with a scrubbing pad.  I use Earth Therapeutics Complexion Pad.  After 3 months my skin is almost completely clear and it stopped all of my rosacea flare-ups.  If I could give this product more than 5 stars, I would.  I also use the Kavi toner every time after I cleanse.  It does have alcohol and salicylic acid in it, but for some reason does not give the same allergic reaction as others, in fact, it calms my skin.  I will always use these products and I am thankful to have found them.  I hope Kavi never stops making them.  Also, check out their website, they have so much information about skin and the mechanisms behind it.  They don't just simply make claims, they have the scientific information to back up their products.  I do not know why the other review was negative, perhaps they didn't use the soap long enough.  I hope this info helps!
B002CSPKSU|5|it WORKS!!!! says what it supposed to do and does it.. ive seen results in a matter of weeks.. i love this product and i have been using over a year now.. i have oily skin and this is the only acne solution that works for me AAAAA
B00HOHLKY2|4|I've been using many ointments on my face for acne, melasma, and poor skin texture and my skin has improved drastically. Once I began using this i noticed a tighter skin texture, my existing breakouts healed, and my skin seemed to glow. I gave it 4 stars because I did get a cyst on my chin which probably is unrelated since I used it all over my face and I got only one deep down. I'm going to keep using this serum and see how my skin is after a longer period of using it. So far I am very pleased.
B0077S35WS|5|Prefect for detangling my curly hair and my daughter's too!
B0018DE69O|5|GREAT THE BEST
B00KOSWWNG|5|My sister-in-law told me about this product, and after using it for a while, I've told others.
B005ELMXP0|5|About five months ago, I ordered this, along with Shea Terra's brand of African Black soap<br />(http://www.amazon.com/Shea-Terra-Organics-Authentic-African/dp/B0046UCYA4/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&qid=1392840333&sr=8-2&keywords=shea+terra+black+soap).<br /><br />I should add that I purchased these because I have been looking for a more natural alternative to treating my onset of adult acne.<br /><br />I used Shea Terra's first and it made my face worse. I can't even describe how terrible my face looked with all the bumps and zits, so I stopped using it, and put this in the back of my shelf thinking I'd get the same result.<br /><br />Now, where I currently live we have very harsh water that doesn't agree with my sensitive skin and it would appear I have developed an eczema issue on parts of my face and neck. My doctor gave me a lotion, and because I don't have a lot of choices in face wash here, I decided to try this bar.<br /><br />I've been using it for about a month, and I haven't had any terrible breakouts since. My face looks healthier and the dry patches had finally started to look normal again and weren't irritating me as much!<br /><br />BUT...I decided to follow a friend's advice and use a Dove bar on my face. THREE DAYS was all it took for my skin to go back to being dry and inflamed again. Not to mention this zit that's slowly making an appearance on my cheek.<br /><br />In a nutshell, this is the best thing I've used on my face thus far. I'm kicking myself because I know I've ruined the good thing I had going by trying the stupid Dove bar, but I know my face will go back to normal after a while.<br /><br />I actually came back to save this particular brand for whenever I should need to order another one and figured, &#34;Why not review something's that's helped me so immensely?&#34;
B003IHVC5Y|4|Applies somewhat chalky, but a lovely color!
B00312GKQW|5|love this cute product
B00BQ76XK2|1|Doesnt bounce little beauty blender
B009XPRZJW|3|Using it for my art supplies!  Great idea!
B000J2A8BK|3|The picture on the website for the color blonde is the exact color of my eyebrows.  But the product goes on really dark brown (almost black) & looks fake on me.  The product was a good consistency and the wand was easy to use but they do not have a color that is lighter than dark brown no matter what it says.
B00VCGNUSU|3|I couldn't get the ball and cap to stay put.  it kept creeping up out of the neck of the bottle.  they seem like they'd be pretty awesome if could just get the ball cap to stay put
B001LRG960|5|Wonderful product and it showed up well before expected and it was in the condition described. I have used a lot of tanning lotions and this is far the BEST! Thank you so much and I WILL be ordering again :) :)
B00AORK8ZG|5|This lotion not only provides me wit the moisturizing I need, it also has a fragance on it that I love.  I literally do not need any perfume when using this lotion. If you want to smell good and have your skin well moisturized, this is the lotion that you need.
B00J0HW4DA|5|I love the Pureology line.  This is the first time I tried the Strength shampoo and am very happy I did.  It does what the same says - adds strength and shine to my hair that is thinning due to aging.  It is pricey, but it delivers!
B00MYIIWP6|3|The shipping was great. My palette came in one piece, no broken powders. Have not used the product, but can't wait to try it out!
B0073SBGVE|3|I ordered this based on the 5 star reviews (no negative reviews at the time), and have been using it for over a month. Honestly I don't think it lives up to the claim on the tube &#34;surgical alternative&#34;.  There are so very few beads for exfoliation, so I still use my homemade scrub of sugar, honey, olive oil, lemon juice twice a week which does a much better job of making my skin glow and feel oh so smooth. My face doesn't really feel refreshed and clean after using this and there is no &#34;improved texture or radiance&#34;. (My skin felt more refreshed when I used Noxema).  On the plus side, you don't need to use a lot of this product to get foaming and it didn't irritate my skin, but to me it just doesn't do enough to warrant another purchase especially when the price went from $9 to $13!
B001AJOEFM|5|great!
B001AWL010|5|My mom has used this product for years. Loves it. Says it helps her wrinkles go away more under her eyes. It also is one of the few that do not have aloe vera in it like some of the other Aubrey products. My mom is allergic to aloe and it is in many under eye and lotion products. She is also very dye sensitive and this product does not cause her any allergic skin rashes or issues.  It has great natural ingredients and she only needs to use a tiny drop or two a day on her fingertip to get the results she needs. Mind you my mother is 65 years old with not terribly wrinkled skin, but some usual age wrinkling going on.  I have used Aubrey products too and it is hard to find this product in stores even health food in my area.  I love Aubrey for their natural ingredients, safety, quality and long term record of not using dangerous or questionable ingredients. It is a bit more expensive, but worth the price we feel.
B002ZF5J2M|2|The springs get messed up and it's a pain getting them in and out to change tension. I don't know if it's just me or what, but I used it for a while and I don't feel like it worked well.
B003QUONE0|4|This is a very small compact! The shadows are less than dime sized but they are nice shadows. Some are a little less pigmented than others But with primer they go on we'll and last all day. If you're looking for a grab and go this is great! This is also a great way to try new colors but you will run out quickly
B0072XT8BA|5|Our daughter is a caucasian 6 year old with curly hair (think Curly Sue). I mention this because there is a misperception that this product is only intended for African American usage. That is simply untrue- or at least it works for us.<br /><br />Even though our daughter has incredibly curly hair naturally, there are times when the curls simply fall apart or just do not look good anymore (I guess the word flat or tangles is applicable). And, since she is hyper sensitive about how she looks when she leaves the house, she demands her hair be either 1) very curly or 2) completely straightened with a hair straightner. This product gives us the option to revitalize the curls very quickly.<br /><br />We typically \\"fix\\" her curls when needed by using the [[ASIN:B007A592HU Motions Naturally You, Define My Curls Cr&egrave;me, 8 Ounce]] as I describe in that review.  When we apply the Hydrate My Curls in combination, the curls get even curlier and very spring like and \\"strong\\" (sorry, that was the only word I could come up with to decribe it accurately). As is the case with any of these products, everyone responds differently  For example, I would not use this product on our daughter who has fine straight blondis hair. This product would be far too heavy and shiny and even appear greasy in her hair. But our daughter with curly hair has much different needs.<br /><br />In our usage, it is worth mentioning we wash her hair at a minimum every two days.  We found the product washes out fairly easily. We also do not use it all the time because it contains mineral oil, which our hair stylist says can damage hair over time.
B00O82VZAU|4|I have owned and loved Otterbox cases in the past.  Decided to go with this case for my sons iPad from the positive reviews.  The case is very nice and I am overall very pleased.  The only reason it's not a 5 star is that the rubber part of the case, in my opinion, is not as heavy duty as an Otterbox case.
B00F6P3DTO|5|I was reluctant to buy the original clarisonic because I didn't want to spend that much on some gadget that may not work. I saw the conair true glow when I was walking through target and decided to take my chances and get it. Best. Decision. Ever. I use it morning and night with the sensitive brush head and cetaphil, followed by Thayers witch hazel and Clinique moisturizing lotion plus. I've recently started to incorporate honey as a spot treatment because of the purging the brush does.<br /><br />Not even a week in and there's  a significant difference in the appearance of my skin. Pores are already shrinking, blackheads disappearing. Scars are diminishing. I can't believe I waited this long!  Aside from the purging that I've been assured is completely normal, my skin has never looked this good.
B00CBY5YUY|5|Just... Just every flavor, so good. You want a delicious preworkout that's so damn good you're gonna be wishing you could just drink it on the normal with dinner and what not? You already know whats up with this C4.<br /><br />DAT WATERMELON THO?! Drink it, love it, it's gorgeous on the tongue.
B0001YO70Y|5|I bought Jazz for my husband in Toronto a long time ago.  It is almost gone and he's been looking for a different aftershave for a few years - and have had no success.  We didn't see Jazz in the department stores - and we both like it very much - and I was very happy to find it on Amazon.com.  The price was excellent - and we received it very quickly.
B00021E6NO|2|The lip buffer is great- but the lip balm is just like putting vaseline on your lips.
B000MAPB6Q|1|Contains the ingredient cetylpyridinium chloride which stains teeth. Couldn't figure out why all of a sudden I had brown stains on a few of my teeth, but after a month of using this product it kept getting worse. Finally connected the dots. Yes, the dentist can remove the stains but I'd rather go back to Biotene (which I don't love) than have to make cleaning appointments twice a month because of this product.
B001L2BEWE|4|Good stuff
B00FNUTYDG|1|Has anyone even looked at the ingredients ??!! 2Minute Miracle Exfoliating Gel<br />Ingredients: Aloe Barbadensis Leaf, Butylene Glycol, Carbomer, Glycerin, Sodium Hydroxide, Hyaluronic Acid, Green Tea Extract, Burdock Root Extract, Ginseng Extract, Calendula Officinalis Flower Extract, Benzophone-4, Propylene Glycol, Proplyparaben, Methylparaben, Diazolidinyl Urea, Cyanocobalamin. So most of these ingredients you can buy online CHEAP & DIY BUT &#34;Sodium Hydroxide&#34; IS BAD FOR SKIN !!! Like other corrosive acids and alkalis, drops of sodium hydroxide solutions can decompose proteins and lipids in skin, eyes or other living tissues via amide hydrolysis and ester hydrolysis, which consequently causes chemical burns and may induce permanent blindness if it contacts eyes.[3][4] Solid alkali may also express its corrosive nature if there is water, so protective equipment such as rubber gloves, safety clothing and eye protection should always be used when handling the material or its solutions.Moreover, dissolution of sodium hydroxide is highly exothermic, and the resulting heat may cause heat burns or ignite flammables. It also produces heat when reacted with acids.<br />The standard first aid measures for alkali spills on the skin is, as for other corrosives, irrigation with large quantities of water. Washing is continued for at least ten to fifteen minutes.<br />Sodium hydroxide is corrosive to several metals, like aluminium which reacts with the alkali to produce flammable hydrogen gas on contact:[26]<br />2 Al + 2 NaOH + 2 H2O → 3 H2 + 2 NaAlO2<br />2 Al + 6 NaOH + x H2O → 3 H2 + 2 Na3AlO3 + x H2O<br />2 Al + 2 NaOH + 6 H2O → 3 H2 + 2 NaAl(OH)4<br />Sodium hydroxide is also mildly corrosive to glass, which can cause damage to glazing or freezing of ground glass joints. Careful storage is needed. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sodium_hydroxide#Safety. NEXT &#34; Butylene Glycol&#34; As someone who wants to apply only natural, nourishing ingredients to my skin, I would recommend that you avoid butylene glycol, mainly because it is derived from petroleum, and doesn’t really add to the health of your skin. (Kind of like eating a Twinkie—may not hurt you, but certainly isn’t going to help you.) NEXT &#34; Benzophone-4&#34;Studies have shown it to act as an irritant and allergan when topically applied to the skin. Our findings would support the inclusion of benzophenone 4 when patch testing to investigate likely contact dermatitis from cosmetics and toiletries. http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17295691. NEXT &#34;Proplyparaben&#34; Parabens can persist in body tissue. One study done in Scotland found parabens in 18 out of 20 breast tumors tested. While conclusive studies have not yet been done, some believe that parabens may be linked to breast cancer in women. Parabens are also commonly found in antiperspirants/deodorants, and many breast cancer tumors are found in the region of the breast closest to the arm pit area. http://greenanswers.com/question/how-proplyparaben-and-methylparabens-bad-cosmetics/. NEXT &#34;methylparaben&#34; Breast Cancer Methylparaben is widely used as a preservative in women's cosmetics, such as skin creams and deodorants. This compound has been found intact within breast cancer tissues. Some researchers suggest that methylparaben may increase risk of breast cancer, or accelerate the growth of these tumors.Skin and Eye Damage Skin treated with creams that contain methylparaben can be damaged with exposure to the sun's UVB rays. This oxidative stress -- damage of the skin cells -- is responsible for a number of disease processes, including cancer.http://www.livestrong.com/article/21581-dangers-methylparaben/. ALSO ANY &#34;PARABEN&#34; What are the health concerns?<br />Endocrine disruption: Of greatest concern is that parabens are known to disrupt hormone function, an effect that is linked to increased risk of breast cancer and reproductive toxicity. Parabens mimic estrogen by binding to estrogen receptors on cells. They also increase the expression of genes usually regulated by estradiol (a natural form of estrogen); these genes cause human breast cancer cells to grow and multiply in cellular studies [9]. Parabens are also linked to cancer, reproductive toxicity, immunotoxicity, neurotoxicity and skin irritation [10]. Since parabens are used to kill bacteria in water-based solutions, they inherently have some toxicity to cells [How can you avoid this? Look for products labeled “paraben-free” and read ingredient lists on labels to avoid products with parabens. Many natural and organic cosmetics manufacturers have found effective alternatives to parabens to prevent microbial growth in personal care products. Some companies have created preservative-free products that have shorter shelf lives than conventional products (six months to a year), but if used daily are likely to be used up before they expire.NEXT &#34;Diazolidinyl Urea&#34; Urea, the Preservative that May Release Formaldehyde ! Releases formaldehyde: According to a study published in 2010, ureas can release formaldehyde, which has been classified as a human carcinogen. In addition, the test found a clear relationship between patch test reactions to formaldehyde-releasers like urea and contact allergy to formaldehyde.Used as a preservative and/or a moisturizer, urea can increase your risk for contact dermatitis, and has also been shown to release formaldehyde—a carcinogen !!! NEXT &#34;Cyanocobalamin&#34; all it is is (vitamin B12) which you can take as a vitamin. SO, just BUY YOUR OWN & DIY !!! It's cheaper & lasts longer. Just buy the good ingredients that are in Ice Elements such as &#34;Hyaluronic Acid&#34;, (you can buy it in powder form & make yourself) &#34;Green Tea Extract&#34;, &#34;Burdock Root Extract, &#34;Ginseng&#34;Extract&#34;, &#34;Calendula Officinalis Flower Extract&#34; ,you can buy the extracts on Amazon or at &#34;Piping Rock&#34; is cheaper & better !!! page for extracts at &#34;Piping Rock&#34; ; http://www.pipingrock.com/extracts-liquid .

B00AXRBAEA|2|I need to stop trying BB creams and stick with one I already know works well. Instead I was at Walgreens feeling spendy and saw this.<br /><br />It was from L'Oreal, a decent brand, which has other products I have used and been satisfied with. How could I not try a tube of the light/medium? I snuck a little onto the back of my hand and it looked good, plus it was marked way down.<br /><br />While it wasn't a huge loss, I wish I hadn't bothered. If you want to know about L'Oreal BB creams, I'm your girl and this is your review.<br /><br />A true BB cream will give you \\"glow\\", minimize skin imperfections, and if good, can even take the place of your foundation. I had found all these assets in a different L'Oreal' product, their Skin Beautifier BB Cream, and thought perhaps their Age Perfect BB Cream Instant Radiance version would be even better. Not even close.<br /><br />This stuff evolves on your skin. When I first put it on, it was alarming - very orangy and greasy-looking (though it was not greasy, just shiny). Maybe 15 minutes later it had settled down with less shine, but a few hours later (maybe 3) it was just gone. Zero tint, zero coverage. I know not to expect major coverage from a BB cream, but this was ridiculous. Nothing was left.<br /><br />As for the possibility of using it as a semi-foundation... nope. I tried applying a second coat in case more was required for results or staying power, but still nada. It is not buildable and a heavier coating doesn't last longer or look better.<br /><br />I have also tried the L'Oreal Paris Youth Code BB Cream Illuminator (Medium) and it was as useless as this Age Perfect one, except the Youth Code one did not disappear, it just never appeared, period. Nothing. A glorified colored sunscreen calling itself a BB cream because BB creams are hot right now.<br /><br />The other, superior Skin Beautifier BB Cream (now also being called \\"Studio Secrets\\") leaves my skin tone even with a subtle pearly finish, minimizes pores,and makes my face look flawless. This is the one that works for me and from which I should not stray. It's light, non-greasy, gives no greasy appearance, provides some light coverage and looks natural.<br /><br />If you are experimenting with BB Creams and not looking to fork out a wad of cash for a premium one, I'd suggest trying the L'Oreal Magic Skin Beautifier BB Cream. You might even try the Maybelline (which was ok but too shiny for my taste). But don't let this Age Perfect Instant Radiance product be your only try of BB creams because there's better stuff out there, honest.
B0026A18K8|5|Bought this for a Christmas gift for a friend. I've bough other products in the past, and always had problems. Stick with a chi and you'll never have a problem.
B007VI9172|1|Fall off in a matter of a day or two.
B005SPEWLA|5|Great product for such a cheap price. It doesn't dry out And last a very long time.
B000053L6Y|5|last a long time, reminds me of barbershop, others think the smell is too strong, but i love it.
B007B1D0YY|5|we went to Fort Lauderdale for the week and baby didn't burn at all!
B000TTPZQ6|5|I don't normally write reviews, but I was so blown away with this lotion I had to. I have had Keratosis Pilaris my whole life on and off and lately it got REALLY bad again on the backs of my arms. I was trying everything and nothing was helping. I kept researching and came across this on Amazon and decided to give it a try. No lie, in TWO DAYS it's all gone. I am so over the moon! In fact, all of my skin is so soft and feels better than it's been for a long time and all the bumps are gone. I had to share the love. :)
B00LVFLELW|1|Not what I ordered wrong color bad wuality
B00OJSZR9S|3|i like the other ones better, these were wayy to soft
B007CFEHC8|4|The product came in great shape with two cream samples. The color is really black but comes on light so you have to build up on it. There's also very little product
B003RW2K0G|5|I have mostly wavy hair and have tried for years to find something that enhanced my curls and controlled frizz. What I love about this product is it enhances curls without adding any of that dreaded crunch. I put it on after the shower and sleep on it to give me more curls, then re-wet my hair in the morning and add a little more.  Voila, beautiful curls. This also doesn't add much volume, which is great for those of us who have enough volume.
B003MA73SW|3|I used to buy this stuff all the time and remember really liking it so I decided to buy it again. While I intend to give it a chance, I can say without doubt that it does absolutely nothing to improve my wrinkles &#34;instantly&#34;. I have used another instant wrinkle filler by Kiehl's that does work but it is more expensive, I was out of it and decided to try this one again. Probably won't buy this one again.
B000JNQSIQ|4|This was very good for the price.It is easy to cut your hair using this.They have provided clear instruction on how to cut your hair and what kind of comb to use. So far i did not find any issues with this
B005Q8QKLY|3|I far prefer the previous, now discontinued product &#34;Straight&#34;.  This one is perfumed and doesn't work as well, but it works pretty well.
B0000CC64Z|3|I saw this in the store and thought I would try it. I've had some good experience with Olay products in controlling acne. This was a nice light cleanser. It made my skin feel soft and smooth, but I would get a lot of acne using this. I have oily skin, so I tried their Olay Deep Cleanser with Witch Hazel. That was much better. It also help clear up my acne, but I also used a toner afterwards. Overall though, if you're looking for just a light moisturizing cleanser and have normal skin this is a nice cleanser.
B008B9L6WS|5|Goes on smooth, fresh scent last all day. I can even feel it on the next morning I wake up. I'm from Houston but moved up north and its really dry out here, my skin was becoming harsh. This definitely did the trick
B00EELSW9M|4|Love this product. It has become a necessity to my skincare/makeup routine. I have ice pick scars on my cheeks from acne a couple of years ago and ive always been self-conscience of them, but with this it glides over my scars and when I put on makeup they are practically gone, definitely less noticeable. Keep in mind I also bought the real techniques expect face brush to buff out and blend my makeup when this was in my cart as well, but they have both become life savers. However, as my headline said, I did receive the one with sunscreen and was pretty sure I bought the oil free one instead, but nevertheless I love this product and will be buying more from this seller regardless of which version of the product. :)
B003I6O5RC|3|Flakey. Nice color and covers lashes well, and does provide volume, but after about 5 hours, the flakes make my eyes itch, so I can't really give this product a great review.
B00WOS36MA|5|Works awesome
B00LUA11EI|4|Great stuff
B000P22TOI|5|I have bought this same product from Amazon 3 times before and let me say this Eternity Set is just awesome. It's one of the best EDT and After Shave by CK.     One glitch about my most recent order is the 3rd party seller I bought this from as it was not available from Amazon directly. The product box came damaged and the shipping box was fine. When I contacted the seller the seller told me that Product Box being damaged doesnt constitute a damaged item and hence I will have to pay for the shipping incase I want to return it. I told him box is damaged and I cant gift it now. He said it your prerogative and he cant do anything about it. Dont buy from the Seller - \\"ThePerfumeSpot\\"
B004QJWV8U|5|This product is great! I tried the classic balm and the pink skin79 BB cream. Both of them are awesome and I will be buying both again. The pink one I leave at home for when i do my makeup before i go out. It is a good size, larger than just a tube of BB cream, and you only need to use half of a dime size in order to cover your face. It leaves such a flawless finish. I know that some people have said that the pink one is a little whiter in color than the classic balm, this is true, but both blend in wonderfully so there really is no difference. I do have a ligh skin complexion so i think thats why it still looked good on me. The pink balm is also a little thicker than the classic balm and will give you a more even airbrushed finish that you would probably like better for a night out. I say get both, ordering two of these balms costs way less than one BB cream at sephora.
B0011CFZA6|5|This is my daughter's new favorite scent, and this was a great value on a large set for her.  The shipping was quick and my daughter is thrilled.
B00GXFS6U2|3|Good
B0073KABJ0|5|If you struggle with cotton balls and foil, or some dip system, struggle no more. These are the very best for working with to remove gel nail polish. I ave used them now for a couple years and cannot imagine using anything else.  They limit the waste of nail polish remover, your fingers are not soaked in the remover, they fold and stay folded well and they are easy to apply. I do my own gel nails and have no problems at all.
B001VE6KJ4|5|my favorite incense, real sandalwood scent, this is a good deal for the price and will last you a long time
B007SZCG0C|5|Using this product is simply and the results are fabulous! I loved it so much that I brought another one for me And my friend. He loved it very much. He says that his roots are touchable when he waves his hand through his hair. I appreciate this product so much and you'll love it or whoever you buy it for a gift! Good luck!
B002N42R0W|5|Great fragrance. I have the spray and like the small size of the tube. I keep one in my car.
B005UBN2AO|3|This is my first time buying dry shampoo, and this product does work, but it has some significant issues.  Next time, I'll try another brand.<br /><br />Pros: Takes away oiliness, just like it's supposed to.<br /><br />Cons: Strange feel & strange smell!<br />You really have to scrub in the shower to get it out!<br />Hair does not look washed, or blow-dried, as others have said.  This dry shampoo gives it a funk of it's own.<br /><br />Bottom line: This product doesn't really get me another day before I have to wash.  It's insufficient if I have to go to work, but if it's just a run to the grocery store, it'll do.
B006JU7I3C|3|This was for my son.  A couple of the bottles had leaked a little and it was visible to the eye and should have been noticed in packaging but my son did not care, he is using it anyway.
B00428ZVKA|1|What a waste of money
B001A3HPT0|5|No complaints from my boyfriend yet!
B001A42R1A|1|I had hoped these would remedy my dry mouth caused by medication.  The reviews were pretty positive so I was sure I had found the solution.  These didn't work for me at all, rather they created a thick coating in my mouth which was more troublesome than the problem it was purchased to correct.  They didn't stimulate saliva production and while the sticking the inside of the cheek is a great feature, it was the only advantage for me.  I'll go back to my hard candy sours.
B002HK2GI0|5|Safe,easy to use and effective. I see some women using PINS and wow, as a doctor I can sure recommend this product!<br />drkimsagewellsolutions
B00IGPP3US|4|Kids like these toothbrushes
B001ET77OI|5|It makes your skin so soft!
B00JYK9OGI|1|I ordered this and did not get it. Instead I got a gold camera necklace that looked nothing like it. It was available when I ordered it.
B003U8ESI4|4|This trimmer is great.  I use the 3mm setting and I get a very even trim.  The vacuum works great letting very few whiskers fall into the sink.  A single battery charge will last me a couple of months using it twice a week.  The only down side is that it doesn't trim other areas very close with the depth guard removed.  I highly recommend this trimmer.
B00KB4V2AW|5|I love this shampoo, it leaves my hair really soft
B005AY8VT8|3|It works okay for oily hair but not quiet as good as I would like.
B001KYVXR4|5|Only eyebrow pencil I ever liked since it's light enough and I don't have to sharpen it. Too bad it's now discontinued.
B00N6RMVWO|4|Not yet thirty days but nails are stronger. Hair seems fuller. Will continue to get maximum results. I drink it cold with stevia and sometimes lemon or lime
B00AGG3MUI|5|Just get the best, and forget the rest.all razor blades are sharp, there supposed to be. Quit worrying about the wimps that tell you these are too sharp.
B004GEXNNM|1|Unfortunately these are not as good as the older version of the same product.  The wires holding the bristles are much weaker than they were in the earlier version.  The bend and break very easily.  I can seldom get through my teeth without straightening the wire.
B0037ZM5OY|2|Read some good things, but personally do not like.<br /><br />Pros:<br />Cheap<br /><br />Cons:<br />Doesn't smell like anything<br />Not strong<br />Doesn't Last<br /><br />I've worn it a few times, and even asking someone to smell me she could hardly smell it.<br /><br />Only thing good about it (warranting 2 stars) is that it's cheap enough to take a gamble on.
B000V0X3GW|5|This is a light hold hair spray. I've been using it for a few years now; and, I find that it holds my hair without becoming sticky.
B00OK6ZCVW|1|Unfortunatly I was very disappointed with this tripod. The springs were very noisy, every time I adjusted it it was very loud. The over all look of it was very cheap. I would not recommend spending more than $20 on this stand.
B00356UHT0|2|it came reaallyyy late and the consitency was good but it broke me out. So its okay i guess  if you dont have oily skin
B00COFOS84|1|Awfuk
B003IWHFKA|5|Really work
B001HUXLBC|5|This is a very fun and interactive gift.  It comes with nine good-sized samples and a certificate that can be turned in for the favorite.  The samples are substantial enough to be used for a while too.  It turned out to be a thoughtful gift.  Better than giving a gift card.  The only caveat is that the recipient must be fairly close to a Sephora store.  The certificate is not redeemable by mail or through Internet purchase.
B0042AV27E|5|My wife has been wrestling with cords, and nearly burning down the house for years with all her curling irons and hair drier.<br />This rack has fixed all that. It's sturdy metal construction insulates the irons well, and when mounted to her vanity, it is very secure.<br />She's very happy with it, which makes me very happy.
B003FO81EA|4|I have been using this cream for 2 years and love it.  It absorbs well and is a good foundation under my sunscreen and make up. I get compliments all the time on how smooth, flawless and young my skin looks. I only wish they listing the ingredients in more detail.  I want to be sure I am using all the right ingredients to get the most out of my cream. I have been researching other products and know what ingredients I need, but am not sure this product has them all. I can only afford it because I am on the member plan and get a discount by buying in quanity. I would like to find a cream that did the same but was more affordable but have not found one yet.
B003QOUJ0S|5|My friend recommended this product and I ordered this to try. After I used this for a week, I throw away my old BB Cream! ;) Fast delivery also!
B00TKJET7W|5|Feels great on my face. This serum has a cooling property that I enjoy a lot. I started using it a few weeks ago and my skin has improved a lot in the meantime. I credit this product. naturabest
B00AYAZ8FS|3|I liked them....I'm not nuts about the glitter.  I ordered them anyway knowing they really weren't for me.  Quality is good and are safe to wear.  Nice selection of tattoos on each page.  Packaging and shipping were fine.
B00MXMMW8G|5|It works miracles I swear I said this won't work but I used it for  a week and I saw the results&#34; great product
B00KPQGJQI|2|Sadly, I just felt that this product was too heavy for my hair. It made it feel greasy, even when applying smaller than a pea size amount. I have extremely fine hair though, maybe that's the issue.
B0013HUQLC|5|I stumbled upon this merchant when I was looking to replenish my TanTowel supply (I'm very pale and go through a LOT of them).  When I came upon this merchant, I thought the price was an error since it is about 30% of the regular price.  No mistake, though!  Fast delivery, too!  Highly recommend the product and this merchant!
B00JJZN1HG|5|Very best sunscreen. This is the only thing I'll use on my kids because of the safety ratings and matte application. Isn't greasy and lasts awhile. I do recommend spreading in your hands before applying. Great stuff!!
B005GY99UW|2|Not impressed with this cosmetic bag. It took about a month to arrive and it wasn't even how I pictured. It's cute, but it's smaller than it looks in the picture. Would not recommend.
B001FXUTUM|5|Love it and it should be sold by amazon.com.  Have used other brands but this is the best!
B00383I8T6|1|I was really excited to find a product that guaranteed hair removal. I thought this was the end to those little black whiskers and peach fuzz around my face and my love trail. Enthusiastically I bought the device straight from their web site on the 60 day trial period and used it consistently for over 3 months. After not seeing results after the 60 days I figured that my hair needs another 2 weeks, after all it does say on the web site that it takes 4-6 weeks to see initial results. Initial results! I SO wanted it to work and kept on using it and even started using it every day. After still not seeing any real results I gave it a break to grow in to get an idea of progress and let my skin take a break. When my hair started growing back it was thicker and more abundant than before. You can only imagine the stress! I have before and after pictures to prove it. I posted them under customer images. You should be able to find them at the top of the page under the product image. ( I was unable to flip the pics...)<br />I called customer service to share my bad experience but they couldn't do anything for me. I asked if there was a certain hair type it works better for but they couldn't tell me that either. Maybe you can find that info through other reviews, but in my experience I would HIGHLY advise everyone NOT to waste their time, money and energy.
B001ET7FHC|5|Most \\"anti bacterial\\" soaps do not do anything SIGNIFICANT to merit the title \\"Anti Bacterial\\".  They do little more than regular soap and water.  This product is a hospital grade soap, that kills the germs that do the most damage in your home.    This soap rinses so fast and clean that, when you first use it, you will wonder if it is really soap.  After you become accustomed to the feel, you will hate the feel of soap scum from regular soaps.   The only issue here is price.  This is the best price I have seen (so far).
B0043OSIVM|5|If you have dandruff this shampoo is great. It works well and your hair feels soft after use. The smell is a little strong but not unpleasant. It helps with dandruff and that's what you buy this shampoo for
B000HU0FM6|5|This product keeps my face hydrated the entire day.  I use it in the morning and prior to going to bed in the evening.  I absolutely love this product!
B006OC4K1I|5|Great product and great seller.
B00133XNSY|5|Smells like you just got a fresh cut from the barbershop, this product is a must have if you have to do any haircutting.
B0002M5JO8|5|I needed replacements again for this brush and have found that stores no longer carry them.  Thankfully I found them here.  I found their quality to be as good as the original heads I had and am pleased with them.  I have not had any issues with bristles coming out or anything like that.  Maybe watch WHO you are buying these types of things from.  I bought mine straight from Amazon.
B000NSTZAU|5|This is the perfect color for me, and one that is virtually impossible to find in stores.  The caps to the two tubes are somewhat tightly screwed on (I had to use a pair of pliers to get them removed), but the product itself is great.  I highly recommend it for anyone who wants his beard/mustache to match a light-brown/dark-blonde hair color!!
B0036WTV2C|4|Bought this for my boyfriend and it he has been now waking up without a painful mouth since using it. Fitting it was fairly easy although it did take us a second attempt. We didn't follow the instructions of reshaping it and starting all over. Only issue on the first try was it not staying on his teeth with his mouth open so we just sat it in hot water for 2 minutes, put it back in place, and then he pushed it tighter to his teeth. It worked without us having to deform the guard back to its original shape.
B0076JVT12|4|I do love the scent, consistency and effectiveness of this product. On the other hand, it makes my blood vessels swell a bit at first, so that's not something I want. A good price and a good product, just maybe not for someone with super sensitive skin.
B004YRTZG0|4|Love it
B004DBVQ14|5|I love how soft my skin had been feeling since using this body wash. It smells great and makes me soft. I have dry skin not severe and my skin doesn't itch after a shower like what most body washes do. I will be buying again
B00HG1JFXY|5|I Love this hair product it makes my hair feel and look smoother and thicker. Does exactly what it's supposed to do!
B00PGXI7QK|4|It's a nice, bright bag but the interior leaves something to be desired. The fabric used in it seems really cheap, and will probably not last a very long time. I bought it for a trip across country and it served its purpose though. I wouldn't recommend it for heavy use.
B001ET787E|5|On time.  Intact.  As advertised.  No problems.  A well known retail item of consistent quality. Cleans and whitens as well as any I have tried.
B004ZD2M6I|3|nada del otro mundo.
B00EP5XZEO|2|It doesn't look like the picture. It only changes in certain places. I really wish that I had a different outcome.
B00FZ29ICO|5|My wife loves this diffuser. It fills the entire house. Hopefully it will be durable for years to come.
B001AHJMO2|5|Such an amazing product.
B004J31KOO|5|I love this product.  The color is perfect for me.  I'm, ahem, at that age where I've lost a lot of brow and not from plucking, I don't.  What's there doesn't show up due to light color.  BBBs goes on easily and smooth and then I follow up with the tube of clear stuff which not only brushes the color thru it seems to set the brow color all day and it doesn't wipe off or smear.  I got the set which included the night time stuff which I forget to use but I LOVE the other two products.  Highly recommend.
B002CNRUQK|2|I should have paid a bit more for some better clippers... I am regretting it now! These wouldn't even cut my 4 yr. old's hair and he has really fine blonde hair.
B001A3HPT0|3|I have very sensitive skin.  I decided to start shaving every day because of my job.  I ended-up with severe razor burn and a huge rash.  I tried switching between Schick, Gillette, and Dorco, but I didn't find any real difference.  After doing some research, I found that the real problem was likely the shaving cream I was using.  I found this kit at the grocery store. Since I started using it, the razor burn has been reduced by 90%.  The aftershave lotion I bought takes care of the last 10%.  Shaving is almost fun.  It's a Boar's hair brush instead of Badger.  Who cares??  Swirling a brush around a bar of soap to make thick bubbles is not rocket science.  I haven't had any Boar's hair injuries as far as I know.  Perhaps a badger hair brush would be better, but I haven't found a reason to complain about this one yet.  The bowl is pretty useless.  The brush actually does a great job of building a lather on its own, despite being boar's hair.  Maybe I'll wash the bowl out and use it for Cheerios in the morning.  The soap is AWESOME!  It gives me a good lather and leaves my face silky smooth without making me smell like Old Spice aftershave.  It basically leaves me burn-free.  Bottom line -- This is a great shave set for people who want something different. In my opinion, the upscale &#34;luxury&#34; sets are highly overrated.  You're going to come out with a hairless face either way.  I haven't had a single co-worker laugh at me because I use Boar instead of Badger. Even if I told them, they wouldn't care.  Believe me, it's a heck of a lot better than the blue goo I used to slather on my face.  Update to my previous post:  The plug on the shaving brush fell out after using it for three months.  The soap and the bowl is really good, but the soap is $1.67 and well...it's just a stupid bowl.  All in all it's really a cheap set.  If you're new to wet shaving,  I would skip this and spring for a good badger brush and some good soap or cream.
B00J9V7X1A|5|Work great on my micropedi at a much lower price.
B003HUJQN2|5|Great perfume!
B005GO5C44|4|This toothpaste is AMAZING. Leave teeth feeling tremindously clean, doesn't foam way to much like every other toothpaste.  All around great product.
B000052XZX|5|Use as directed and results are great! I have tried a lot of previous products and this works! Totally worth  the money.
B00AN2FYHY|5|Best diaper rash creme ever!
B003987CL0|2|I am used to using the regular plain ol jane gillete razor. It is my favorite, my holy grail, I've been using it for years. I was excited to step out of the norm and try this battery powered razor by gillete. I liked the razor but I think I will stick with mt regular gillete razor without the battery power. It kind of irritated my skin and just didn't work for me. The price of this razor just isn't worth it. I still enjoy Gillete products and look forward to trying more out in the future.
B00HS694XI|4|This worked pretty well for me my breasts did grow and get firmer. My right breast is smaller than my right so I couldn't buy breast pills so I tried this. Keep in mind I didn't use it everyday and skipped a lot of times so if I had used it everyday it would have grown alot more. It is help but not a miracle growth.
B00AAQGQT8|1|didn't like
B001E96P5K|5|Killer deal and this is my favorite floss.
B005LP5AA4|1|There are more reputable companies and products out there that do not charge a membership.  Do NOT waste your money on a membership to IT WORKS, because it really does NOT work.
B00C2CGD8C|2|I got this thinking the lipstick actually glows in the dark to use during a concert. I couldn't find any other lipstick that glows in the dark without a black light. I was super excited to get it, but when I got it, I could't figure out how to get it to work. I thought I had to activate it with light, but that didn't work and it didn't just glow on its own. I logged back on to this website and read the description and saw it said &#34;light switch&#34; and then i realized it doesn't actually glow, it just has a light on the case. I was very disappointed, but the lipstick itself is good quality. It stays on well and doesn't smear. Just letting you know THE LIPSTICK DOESNT GLOW THERE IS ONLY A LIGHT. The title of this product is very sneaky.
B001QXBWAC|5|I love this fragrance. A friend of mine had it and a fellow co-worker and my self loved it. We both ordered it through amazon. This was even better because we paid alot less than what she paid in the store.
B0071B6R62|5|great packaging.  tastes ok.
B0001MROQA|5|One of my favorites
B000OP3R74|5|Ingredients: Propanediol, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice, Aqua, Glycerin, Sodium Stearate, Ethylhexylglycerin, Oriza Sativa (Rice Starch), Rosmarinus Officinalis (Rosemary) Leaf Extract, Carum Petroselinum (Parsley) Extract, Salvia Officinalis (Sage) Leaf Extract, Allantoin, Bisabolol, Zinc Ricinoleate, Mineral Salts (Potassium Alum), Hydroxyethylcellulose, Fragrance.  This deodorant is still my go to for year round comfort; pay close attention to the formula changes, though. The scent is still the same musky smell as always and the protection remains the same, as far as I can tell. Silver is gone as an ingredient and potassium alum is in, just one notable change in the formula. So far, so good ...
B003RC79UM|3|Works OK. My prior trimmer had a dial that set the length of the trim. I liked that better than the different heads on this one because it stored more compactly with everything on one instrument. The beard trimmer is slightly too large and is harder to get a smooth trim on the lower edge of the mustache.
B001OA82ZK|5|This and tiare jasmine by juara are 2 of my favs. This scent is very fresh and clean smelling. Highly recommend.
B001KNWSG0|5|This sunscreen has broad coverage and is very smooth going on. It is not too oily and not too dry.
B00AIY2SIU|5|I wore this amazing scent and I went to see my doctor on a regular checkup,while he was checking my heartbeat with his stethoscope he asked me what's my perfume name that he really likes it and I said Oscar by Oscar de la Renta EDT spray,he wants to buy one too to his wife,I told him buy it from amazon.com its cheaper and they have great qualities items for lower prices.
B00LINL1TM|5|Workin fine justwhat I orderd
B001DYM62C|4|This works well on one of my cats, but I wish that the teeth were a little longer to be able to comb through long hair (thick) cats coats.
B0015Z5BU8|1|This vendor (B glowing) found a way to water down the product and reseal the tube, selling it as new condition. I have used this product from other sellers in the past, and I could tell as soon as I opened it that this tube was not the same. It was thin and runny and did not give me the same results. Do not buy from this vendor! BTY the product itself is great.
B0052ECYG2|4|Today is MAY 2,2015. Just received the package intact after 10 days of delays from expected arrival of the item, Thank you anyway.  I hope these will never happen again.
B00HR929WO|5|The boyfriend loves it.
B0054Y6DVM|4|After going to the hairdresser and her turning my hair a nice orange colour, this product has worked well to tone it all down. I would definitely recommend it. It does seem to be a bit drying, so I recommend applying conditioner after you use the shampoo
B006RFZ8NG|5|Biore's Combination Skin Balancing Cleanser is a nice deep cleanser but is designed for combination skin which is what most of us probably have anyway. I liked it a lot. It did a good job of cleansing but my skin didn't feel stripped at the same time. It's hard to find a facial cleanser that is deep cleansing, oil-free and yet doesn't dry your skin.<br /><br />Thumbs up!
B00BYH6I6I|5|My go to gift
B006HA2QC2|5|I never review products at my own will, but I have to say that this scrub is the truth! My skin feels soft, nourished, and not greasy like so many other scrubs leave you feeling. I'm totally going to have to check out their other products!
B001MA0QY2|4|Good product
B004IIACFS|5|I bought this as I make my own perfume and I have a bedroom set over 100 years old.  I wanted it to fit with my vanity, and could only hope that it actually worked.  I adore this and will be looking for more like it.  It sprays nicely.
B000ELP5KA|5|I love the smell of this product.  I use it in my laundry, mixing vinegar and this oil, as a fabric softener.  I love the fact that it kills any germs as it is sometimes used on the face for blemishes.
B00UKGCHNC|1|I agree with M Homer,Used self tanners before in the past, this product is no different,turns you orange even after multiple applications,I would NOT recommend this to anyone I know.However they did refund my money as they said they would.You want a self tanner,you can buy the best one at walmart for a heck of allot less money and get the same,if not a little better results.
B00KP5TS4Y|5|This blackhead and blemish remover is the best! I am absolutely obsessed with popping pimples and blackheads, and I seriously never knew this existed! I used it on my boyfriend the other day on a problem pimple and I couldn't believe how much came out of it! (TMI I know....).But I was so satisfied!  I recommend this product if you are obsessed with popping things like I am.  I haven't yet found out how to use all the tools, but it comes with about 6 different tools to use and explore.
B005G9WK8U|5|works
B007TQBGCY|4|So this is a very cute wig. Its wavy, but i does not have dark highlights at the root as the photo shows, its light brownish all the way thru. It does shed if you comb it, but i just got it, but overall for the price its super cute, i can rock it :)
B0007A94S2|5|Great
B000GLRREU|5|even though, i must say that even with the pik pocket, it doesnt have very good access to periadontal pockets, and I'm not really sure that it does what it says its supposed to, but the pressure is good(there is actually a little too much) and the tank is about 20% too big which is good because it means that you wont have to refill it twice in one rinse.  I mix in a couple capfulls of mouthwash for good measure.
B000DN7BUQ|5|I am addicted to the fragrance. It's expensive, though. Wish they would lower the price so I could use it everyday.
B009LM2MR2|5|Ordered on September 7 and arrived on September 15 all the way from Hong Kong with free Shipping from COSPLAY SKY.  Great quality, lace cap.  For the price I was expecting a costume wig but it's a quality wig with perfect packaging and looks beautiful.
B0052FZ3CI|5|My teenage daughter and I have 100's of Opi nail polishes.  I ordered 2 table rack displays and need more!  I am very satisfied with this purchase.
B0075GXW0W|3|Its pretty good-but I prefer the shampoo. It does keep the hair feeling healthy. It also keeps it from looking dull.
B009WI3RZQ|5|Great product! Really helps in setting under eye concealer and foundation!
B00110DD0W|2|This cream did not work - no sirve; we had very high expectations and did not work well. No adelgaza, hace sudar
B00AHF1GK6|5|I do NOT use disposable or any razor other than electric... normally. This is because I have not found a comfortable razor other than electric. I hate to nick my face and feel the razor rip at the hairs as it attempts to cut them. I used the cheapest shave cream I could find (a bar of hand soap) because I did not want to skew the results by reviewing the shave cream instead of the razor.<br /><br />This razor is NOT at all what I expected. I have used disposables in the past and this is not in the same class. It was comfortable as it left a protective film on my face as I shaved to make the razor glide across my cheeks, chin and neck. It completely surprised me as it did what it was it was built to do with complete comfort while providing the closest shave I have had in a long time. My wife asked me what I did to make my face so smooth!<br /><br />I intentionally have not shaved for three days, and my facial hair grows in thick and fast. This razor had no problem tackling my growth in comfort and with ease. When I went to rinse the razor I expected the blades to become clogged with hair, which they never did. The hair rinsed right away to enable me to continue shaving. The flip away strip on the top is awesome in that I was able to get even closer to my nose to get those stubborn hairs that grow right next to it.<br /><br />While I will probably continue to use an electric razor these are definitely going into my kit in case there is a power outage or other need where my electric razor cannot be used.Either way, there will be some kept in my car in case I forget to shave before work, which has happened. Who knows, with many more shaves like this one I may switch and always use these instead...<br /><br />Dr. Stephen Hoemke
B0043OUJBE|4|I received a free tube of this as a Bzz Agent. In general, I don't like liquid foundations, but I must say I did like this one. It seemed to soak into my skin really well, almost like a lotion, leaving my skin feeling moisturized and natural rather than slathered with a mask. It's smooth and easy to apply, giving good coverage, and for the first few hours, it leaves a matte finish. I would recommend applying it with your fingers rather than a sponge as I got it on too heavy with a sponge.    I gave it four stars because although it left my face looking nice, it wasn't \\"polished\\" as the marketing claims it will do. Also, after a few hours I needed to put powder on to control the shine. But despite that, if I ever need to use a liquid foundation, this is the one I would use.
B000O53THC|5|Super FAST delivery!  I found a sample of this in a magazine, years ago and loved it so much I bought the Brit for woman.  It was okay but not as good as this for men.  Yes I am a woman and yes I LOVE wearing the Burberry Brit for Men and I wear it day and night, long lasting and wonderful.
B007ISRNCA|5|works like a dream!
B004VWCJZW|5|Shampoo Cre-C Max! Ahora Con Gingseng - Cre-C Max! Now With Gingseng is a great shampoo that I order over and over again because it lives up to its promotion of helping to stop hair loss.
B000WBBL28|5|Yayyyy my fav ! I always Get it in time ! Thank you so much highly recommened it !
B00401U8AC|5|Love the smell and how it makes you feel using it!
B00CZAEUEA|4|works great keeping hair smooth and shiny; i have mod thick long blonde hair and this lasts me months. its not as great as Moroccan oil but that is so expensive i dont like to use it daily... this is a great off day use
B00L6ZCHEK|1|Color was way too light for me stated it was supposed to be a medium but it was way too white
B001KYNW5A|5|Good product.  Great price.
B004QE83VE|5|Love this razor, two bars of moisturizer help tremendously and save time from having to apply shaving cream.  Even extremely coarse and thick hair has been no problem at all.
B0002AHY6Q|4|[[ASIN:B0002AHY6Q Waterpik WP-360W Hand-held Cordless Rechargeable Dental Water Jet]]Yep, the battery is the weakness of this unit.  Litheon Ion would have been a far superior technology.  For Pete's sake, this unit is billed as a portable unit.  Don't expect a massive reservoir!  So what if you have to fill it 2 or more times.  Two fillings do the job well and I have 2 bridges.  Floss first to loosen particles.  Spending to much time in one area could damage gum tissues.  I have used this unit for over a year now, along with daily brushing and flossing, and my hygenist is very impressed.  I believe it's worth the $25 to try it and see if you like it.  Your teeth are worth it!
B00I0G3LUM|5|Love, love, love this stuff! I wish Victoria's Secret wouldn't have quit selling this in their stores.
B000C21A7I|5|I ordered this product for my wife.  She loves it and so do I!  Charlie has a great fragrance that we both like.
B00104Y9T8|4|This is by far the best blush/bronzer I have ever used, and I have spent hundreds of dollars on a products. It is not good as a foundation or anything else. It does give your skin a nice natural glow but that is all you can expect from this product. It not do any of the other things promised. It does not cover anything, or look good as a foundation. It is so pink, that no one has natural skin color like that, unless they have a disorder. If you are looking for the perfect bronzer or blush, then this is it, but don't buy it as an all over makeup.
B004OHQR1Q|4|This are excellent for the price, I bought them for my daughter she likes them. I would recommend this excellent price!
B001TXB4G6|5|This is amazing at keeping my face acne free.  I use nightly.
B0000536M2|5|my favorite mascara.  It definitely lives up to the name of being Full and SOFT.  I use this product because it is soft and doesn't clump or stiffin my eyelashes.
B000EBFJWY|2|Ouch, hurt like heck
B00HJDIAGC|1|This product is terrible. First Amazon purchase I've ever been unhappy with. Forget 8oz of water when you heat the mouth trays, you better use the biggest pot you can find. If the mold even slightly touches the side or bottom it will melt to it and be ruined. Also the syringes are terrible, when I tried to put the tip on, half of the gel immediately oozed out. (Yes, I was doing it the right way). As another reviewer has said, don't be fooled by all the positive reviews, they are false. Don't waste your money.
B004LCIOF6|5|love to use this color when im using my jeans and mixed with red eye shadow, not only that but this dark blue will match all lighter colors, and its just wonderful !!
B003U8ESI4|5|This is my second Norelco Vacuum Beard Trimmer and this operates smoother than the first.  Settings for beard length allow for more precise trimming and vacuum function is a must.  I would highly recommend this product.
B0025U19SA|1|Based on delivery time, I guess they forged the metal to make these by hand.
B009WDQOVU|5|This really works well for people who want to avoid chemicals and fragrance and who don't want body odor. I have tried both varieties. This is an adjustment from commercial brand anti-perspirant/deodorant. First you have to learn how to put it on. Yes it can be crumbly and some batches are a little different then others. I have found that holding the product to my underarm for about 30 seconds and then doing a few light swipes on each side is the best method for me. It feels like you've hardly put any on but it is enough. I have tried running under hot water but then too much product was applied for me. You need a LOT less then when you use a commercial brand. Secondly this is NOT an antiperspirant so it does not stop the natural sweating process but I note that I sweat quite a bit less and I never have that sticky &#34;uhoh I forgot my deodorant today feeling&#34;, and I never have underarm odor. If I run out and use a commercial brand, underarm odor returns within a few days. I still keep a commercial antiperspirant around for when I really do NOT want to sweat - like a job interview or some dress up sleeveless affair. But otherwise this product is my first choice. This is the first I've noticed this product on Amazon and have order from the manufacturer, bought at health fairs and also Whole Foods in Michigan (they don't have it at my FL whole foods)
B00176MTCI|2|First of all, the package arrived a week before and so are the two stars. In the ad he says it's a Iso and is actually a PROLISS, says it \\"tourmaline ceramic\\" and its titanium. I totally regret.
B00Q9ECTQO|5|Just what I needed
B00LZJ250S|5|Very surprised for my price I paid. Good hair for a decent price
B000RFRMAO|5|And it's so hard to find!<br /><br />Honestly, Nads is so much easier to use than hot wax because it is water soluble. If it gets somewhere it doesn't belong, it comes off easily and you don't risk removing hair that you don't want to remove. This wand makes it super simple to apply to brows, and the combination of the nads and the included strips lift hair very easily.<br /><br />The one disadvantage to the facial wand is that some of the product is wasted because the click up mechanism can no longer dispense it once it gets down to a certain level. You probably lose one whole brow-waxing use this way. The mechanism could be better, but the product is so good that I'll continue to purchase it despite the little bit of waste.
B004C7EFIK|1|Total junk.  I bought these to replace some older ones that were worn, but I ended up keeping the old ones and throwing 2 (out of 4) of the new ones in the garbage - the snap lids didn't stay closed.
B0015PMBUQ|1|i have bought tan towel before. the one that comes in a silver package. i'm wondering if this is a different company with the same name because the results are not good. my legs are a streaky, orange mess.  ugh! i can only hope it fades fast.
B000JL80RU|5|It has a raw silk scent in it, and I love it. all my favorite perfumes have been discontinued and I love when I can find them. Wears away quickly though.
B003KJBK3E|4|it is small enough for her small fingers. brush is soft and easy to brush a toddler small mouth.i also love it's BPA free which is hard to get in stores.
B000UWAWQU|5|Bought this to replace my other Waterpic who's battery totally died and wouldn't hold a charge.<br /><br />This one is the exact same thing as I had. It holds a charge for about a week and a half of using it 1-2 times a day.<br /><br />Works great!
B007ZUHIQ2|5|Very easy  to use and leave skin feeling smooth and soft. Great  to use on hands as well especially in winter!
B00YURCLJ2|5|Got a sample with product.  Not sure if I would pay that much for it though!
B009PHN3QW|3|It was too small. When I got all I needed in the bag it wouldn't close. If you're looking for a small bag its great but larger its not.
B00J75GAZ8|1|Too loose and messy.  Not precise. Hard to work with
B00JFWA72U|5|Hold is great.  Scent is also pretty good.  I think it might be a little fruity smell (watermelon maybe??), but its still a classic type smell.  rinses easy and recombs with a little water as well.
B008X2133K|5|For A Great French Style! I love this! I have always loved getting the french manicure but now I can do this at home and save more money! And some kits don't even have a top coat! Great for the budget savvy Diva!
B00IWKDYV2|2|Although I received a nice value in cost these chalk sticks were extremely messy, broke easily and were not as washable as stated. I was disappointed :(
B0007MW2ZW|3|I have not used the product yet but please read this warning before ordering!!!!<br /><br />Be warned if you live in a hot climate before ordering this product. I'm from Vegas, ordered this in July, by the time it sat in the mail truck all day 100+ degrees, and then my mail box for maybe only an hour it had turned completely liquid from the heat and probably 1/4 to 1/3 of the product oozed out and covered all the other items in my box. (Thankfully they were all shaving related). I rinsed the container off in cold water and put it in the fridge, i will give an update as to if the product is ruined or not, It looked pretty coagulated and separated from the heat when i opened the lid. I don't know if it is supposed to just look like a uniform paste or what, so i have no way of knowing if it is ok back at normal temperature.<br /><br />The product smells nice, though. I will update on if it can be saved.
B00ESQ0X8G|5|Works great on my sons curly locks! A good friend recommended this product and I love it. Smells great and doesn't leave a lot of residue if not excessively used. A little goes a long way
B001MA0QY2|1|Snagged on my hair and didn't straighten my hair at all. My hair is wavy and had a very dull look after using this iron.
B0060K86DM|5|Very Satisfied!!
B006LRVXKW|3|It cleans and takes off make up well but is so overrated as it has not made my skin better or clearer.
B004WEHYH2|3|I wanted to try this out because Dinair was a matte finish and I have dry skin. This is a satin finish which I like but it does not last as long as Dinair. It is easily rubbed off and takes longer to set. Also it takes forever to shake the bottle for the makeup to be fully mixed. Dinair isn't that much more to buy so next time I will go with Dinair or try out the Colair line.
B00BGVM95Q|5|Love this shampoo and the size of the bottle.  It's much cheaper on Amazon than at our local Wal-Mart.  The shampoo/conditioner makes my hair very soft and easy to manager.  I have very long, straight hair.  Before switching to this product I used Wen Hair care products and I like this brand better.  Giovanni shampoo/conditioner is very similar to Wen as far as how it makes my hair feel and look after the wash and you don't have to you as much of this product as you do Wen so it really makes it worth the money.
B00I3VHKVK|5|super cute and sturdy, perfect for my makeup bag!!
B0036C2Z3E|2|you could not turn off the narration the more you turn up the volume the louder the narration got unable to enjoy the move
B003UH5PBO|5|I use it before ... I like it
B00475M3TU|5|What a great way to start, or expand, your collection of essential oils.  Arrived quickly and well packed.  I love the smell of the essential oils when I opened the box...that alone spread a warm feeling through me.  My order shipped the same day and arrived two business days later.  Many people do not realize that Essential Oils can help aid in many daily conditions as well as help prevent illness.  I find that Lavender relaxes me, Eucalyptus helps with my sinus and allergies issues,  Tea Tree is excellent on cuts and breakouts, just to name a few.  What natural remedies and aids will you find in your kit?  Excellent quality oil and service was fast.
B00810KJPC|5|This is my favorite Parfum.  When I wear it I'm always told how good it smells and what am I wearing also where can I find it.  I always tell them that I purchase mine through Amazon.com because I get the Best price by far. I Also keep it on my wish list on Amazon.Com so when Valentines Day, Mother's Day,  Birthday and always the Holiday season.  Amazon.com also offers gift wrapping and a card telling you who has sent your gift.  Best price under $20.
B00P58Q952|5|Exelente
B0086HRNV8|5|Great eye cream at a great price.  Love it.  I highly recommend this product. I have used this product before and find that it works!!!
B001AC1U42|1|The color of this is nice but it is so dry!  Hard to apply and flakes!  I won't purchase again.
B00E9G1WQ2|5|I'm on my third bottle and this stuff works miracles.  I went from being embarrassed about a flair up of adult acne to being complemented on my skin.  I add a couple drops of this to the Clear Skin Moisturizer 2x/day and apply an additional time over any break out areas mid-day.  Love love love this stuff.  Best product of the Eminence line.  It literally saved me thousands of dollars in unnecessary treatments by a top rated dermatologist.
B000EGZ3KM|1|The product shipped quickly, but when I opened the package, the bottle had leaked and most of the acetone had evaporated. There was perhaps two inches left in the bottom of the bottle.<br />To be fair, I cannot tell if this is the fault of the seller, the manufacturer, or the shipper...
B000AAAWAI|1|i was reallllly hopeful about this product- but seriously, it has the consistency of petroleum jelly!<br />ewww[...] followed the directions exactly- but my hair was so greasy and sticky i seriously had to wash it out with dish soap. :(((((<br />  i am not exaggerating- this has the texture of Crisco shortening.
B0056UWEPS|5|I love this product!
B00N4UXI6G|5|For years I've searched some products for eliminate cellulite too expensive or others didnt work at all, and this combinated with the brush really works I've only used it for 10 days and I can see some diference I can wait to see how will it works in a weeks. Besides leave a relax and fresh it after use it.
B006UET4XE|5|I love this eyeliner lasts allday its very good
B000GRB3SK|2|This was my favorite body wash for years, but now they have changed the formula, and the scent is not the same.  That scent was the main reason why I bought it.  The old scent was much more natural, and reminded me of fresh cucumbers and melons.  The new scent is much more like a standard soapy, chemical perfume fragrance.  If you look carefully at the ingredients on the label, it no longer contains aloe leaf extract either, yet they still call it aloe body wash.  I gave Procter and Gamble consumer relations my feedback, and you can too.  (800) 395-9960
B00JJCGCWK|2|Disappointing :( Bought to wear for my wedding, the rhinestones were falling off and they were so small my 5 year old  flower girl will be wearing them now because they are THAT small. They do unlace but if you do that and lace them back up you won't be able to open your adult hand
B00H5NR5EE|5|Total luxury item, and I love it! My daughter used to scream when it was lotion time, she would cry it was too cold. This warmer is awesome, lotion is always warm and ready to go- it's a nice treat!
B004VE3MEM|5|I have used whitening gels before, back when they were weaker, like 10%. This stuff is amazing. I went from yellowed to brilliant white in only 2 syringes. For those complaining about the burning sensation: you put too much in the tray and got it on your gums. Also, if you keep using the stuff, after a single syringe your gums don't even feel overfill anymore. This stuff is fantastic, can't say enough good things, would buy it again.
B00IUF1P4C|4|Really like it... It's shiny... Will recommend.
B0043RKN94|5|A must have&#62; With professional use only!
B007MFADZS|2|This product was not of good quality.  The hair matted up & you could not finger comb it either. I have had other Bobbi Boss wigs, but this one was not good.
B00N30SE3E|4|Although I haven't used it internationally yet, I like this iron so far.  It heats up quickly, is ergonomic and has a great cord.  The only two downsides are the dial is inside between the irons and is not digital so you have to guess what temperature you are on, and it didn't come with the adapter plugs as advertised.
B000EHH7LE|5|This is an excellent product for someone (like myself) who has fine, thin hair. Most products leave my hair &#34;heavy&#34; and actually make it worse. Nioxin holds my style and my hair is not weighed down. I love it!
B0010XUU9M|4|I keep these with me at work and use them when I work long shifts.  Really love how clean they leave my skin, but also moisturized.  Very mild scent which is great!
B00FFFMF6W|5|My hair is completely grey now and I dye it so it is very course and dry. This, combine with the liquid make my hair feel like it used to before I went grey.
B00AAIBT8Y|5|Color fades evenly over many hours and doesn't ooze outside the lip line, even after eating.  Leaves a slightly waxy finish on the lips--not unpleasant to me, but different from any other product I've tried.  The color &#34;Trendsetter&#34; is magenta.
B008GOR6O0|4|Great price for a nice product! Creamy and well pigmented, this pallet is super useful! A must have for anyone that does their makeup
B00K1IWK3G|5|excellent item especially 'cruelty free'.
B00J2G5KCQ|5|perfect, they do what they are supposed to
B0041VJ3QQ|4|By accident in a Walmart, I saw this 12 oz liquid soap with the lovely scene on the label of a French villa surrounded by lavender. I took a whiff and loved it instantly. I just love the feel of the soap and what seems a wonderful lavender scent, but Walmart stopped carrying it, so I searched for it on Amazon.com. Now I see various labels under the same name with mixed reviews.  I didn't give it 5 stars simply  because I do not see lavender listed in the ingredients, but several natural oils and fragrances. Still, the soap feels wonderful and it's the most realistic lavender scent I've found in a soap in years; most are disgusting. I'm just not sure whether to buy it online with all the mixed reviews. Mine is definitely NOT sandy as one review indicated, but it is in a 12 oz dispenser. The product I've seen in a 16.5 oz bottle seems to be something different. Unless I can find it locally, I don't plan on ordering it from A.com. The ingredients in my bottle are:  filtered water, coconut and olive oil, natural vegetable glycerin, cellulose, blends of fragrance and natural essential oils (whatever those are), citric acid and vitamin E. It really gives my shower a whole new theraputic dimension, but how can I be sure the ones offered here are the same thing? So many products that become very successful and popular end up being reformulated into something different to increase the profit margins of the manufacturer. I wonder if this is happening to this product.
B006CA1URE|5|Now I normally don;t write review just because its a pain in the butt, but this product is totally worth it! I have coarse, thick curly hair which means I have a lot of hair and the individual strands are thick… which means my hair requires a ton of moisture in order to not frizz. As a weekly treatment this product smooths my strands and leaves my hair feeling soft and shiny without weighing it down! Definitely worth every penny and shipped pretty fast as well.
B00VT5767K|2|Didn't come with any clips like it said it would.  Just a bunch of separate wefts that are about 2 inches long and curly.  Not sure what I'm going to do with it.  I was going to keep it in the bun and attach it with the clip (no clip though) or bobby pins but they are not securely put in a bun, just gold thread to hold it together so you really need to separate them and then just have a bunch of 2 inch wefts.  I'm going to try to sew them into something.  Lots of hair for the money and it is human hair and curly which is hard to find but unsure if I can make it look right.  Has an odd chemical smell.  Maybe I'll wash it.  Also, the color show, a dark chocolate brown, was not the one I received.  Mine is black so it doesn't match my hair.  I think they should at least send me the color I ordered for free!
B003E1CXJI|5|I have used this product for a long time, and still think it is great stuff!
B0049LUI9O|4|First off, this is my first and only nose trimmer.  It works amazing.  I was using an attachment to my Remington (not an actual nose trimmer attachment) and it was ok but only got the long hairs.  After using this one, I will never go back to the attachment.  It got every hair in my nose, and I trimmed my goatee with precision and ease.  Be sure to read all the warnings first.  I made sure not to press hard on my face or nose to avoid potential bleeding.  The cleaning drain is pretty cool.  I follow the instructions and twist of cap to help dry faster.  My only wish, and therefore one less star, is that it was rechargeable.  It uses one battery and seems to last a while but I think I will invest in more rechargeable batteries from energizer or Duracell, etc...
B003V7KWB6|5|I just purchased this online and we'll see how it goes. I supposed to receive this item by tomorrow so I'll give an update about this product after usage. :)<br /><br />It's 06/06/2013 and I want to give you guys an update about this lotion. Well... I am very satisfied with the results. I mean, I don't just rely on this lotion that it will gonna do a magic but it really worked for me after using this product for couple of days. Application of course base on the instruction of the product and a healthy balance diet giving me the best results. I like this product a lot! I bought three kinds of lotion under this brand and what I can only say is, keep up the great work of putting this out the  market. It is really a big hit! it's affordable and effective. :) Good luck
B004C2ENSM|1|Do not waste your money on this. It is poorly made and even has splinters on it. The handle is too short. DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY!
B00L673GRA|4|cool!
B004V9600U|5|This stand is great! I got it for my daughter to use and it works perfectly. The material is sturdy and the suction cups are not flimsy.
B004W34BTC|3|I like using disposable long tubes. This seller claims that this will work with any tube. Well it does not work with disposable long tubes. The frame is too long. if the frame was about a .5\\" shorter it would work perfect. The circumference is also too wide. The distance in which the needle moves up and down is more than double of what is necessary. It's hard to set the right speed because you have to get used to the delay of the needle moving up and down. My home made rotary machine outperformes this one. After about an hour of adjusting I was finally able to get it adjusted to perfom to my satisfaction. I did a name tattoo and the lines came out very nice. You have to use your own tube, grip, and tip to set it up right. But once it sets up the machine ends up being too long. I have medium size hands so the overall lenth is a lil too long for comfort. If you have large hands this will be the rotary machine for you.
B003C3QT3O|5|Great product
B004T3KJN2|2|I've not found this product very good at all.  I tried this brand because Veet is well known, but that doesn't mean it's a great product it would seem.  Despite following the instructions the wax is an inferior quality and the wax-area on the strip is smaller than others I've tried
B002D4B6Y0|5|This is a great product. I've been using it for years to wet my hair and make it a little more manageable. It smells nice and it's also good for the skin to prevent dryness after being out in the sun. I buy the 32oz. size and then put it into a regular 12oz container, more cost effective. (my wife hates the smell, but I like it)
B00197NZ8C|3|I thought this color would look better with my skin tone. It's a almost sheer, frosty color. I'm not really a fan of frost, but I know I will finish off this tube. I won't rebuy though.
B004CCJH10|5|Only razor that does not cause cuts on my legs!  Have used for many years and love them.
B00BOJI5PS|5|I used to use this perfume. Like the name, it's extraordinary. I was sad when they removed it from the catalogues. Nice to see it here.
B008YEMWOG|5|This product is great for cleaning the plaque from your teeth. I feel like I just got back from the dentist after using this. My teeth just look better since I've been using it. I would recommend this product. It works great for me.
B0013945H6|4|This system seems to be working for me. I already purchased the shampoo at the salon. This is a great price. I have noticed much less hair on the bathroom floor. It's nice and light<br />Only downside is that gnats seem to be attracted to it outside in the yard.
B00ARF42D4|1|I've had this about a month and have to say it's a poor design. The PRO are has great battery life and power, slick looking, with easy controls. But the CON is the killer as due to it's design you can't get an even trim no matter the setting. The guard that controls the height/length is a one piece plastic anchored far away from where the blades are and the guard is flimsy and moves. So when you press the clippers on your face and are going along the contours of your face the guard flexes and exposes the blades at different levels that results in a very shaggy shave. I've had other shavers, I think the predecessor to this one that had a column type guard and was very secure and didn't have this problem at all. I can only use this without the guard for a really close trim, but I like a little more length. There are lots of positive reviews on here, but I can't image why someone would give this 5 stars as who whats a shaggy uneven beard?
B00KJS3TEW|4|Smells absolutely amazing! I got so many compliments from girls at my school after wearing this! Even my teacher said I smell good.
B00H8YF1VE|5|I received this free with a promotional code. It is truly awesome stuff! I was amazed at the size of the bottle when it arrived and it has helped my hair feel so soft and smooth. I had never heard of it before the promotion, so I am just really very thrilled. I recommend this product!
B00NQHFGMG|5|Very good product at a very good price.  I see the difference in my skin and other people see it too.  The skin is smoother, tighter, less wrinkles, and a more youthful look.  I recommended it to my friends already and definitely will keep using it.  I have Body Merry's eye cream, neck cream, retinol surge moisturizer and this hyaluronic acid serum and they all performs well.
B0000Y3GIE|5|I am using this to make my nails harder and stronger. So far, it is working. I hope it continues to.
B000VXIBQQ|5|The hotel my wife & I stayed at in Brazil had this soap in the room; we liked it so much, we bought 8 bars and brought it back with us!  Since I haven't been able to find any more, we've been saving it and only using it on the weekends, when it makes our bathroom smell like a spa.  If anybody knows where to get more in the U.S., please post it!
B000A3ENTG|5|Love it!!! I bought this when I had a short pixie haircut and it is amazing! It can grasp even the shortest hairs. I like the fact that it isn't travel size either. It has temperature settings also. The best flat iron for short hair. I'm African American, and I used this iron on short relaxed hair. My hair has since grown out, and I still use it in shorter sections. It's perfect!
B008OBUZ5W|5|nice product-very pleased with purchase
B001282DRM|5|Had these glasses before and they broke, I found them here and I had to order them. Love them!
B005DKKBTC|5|Let me make this simple for you. Buy this Razor. It is hands-down this is the best electric shaver that I have ever owned. I've had Norelco, Remington and Braun. None of them ever came close to the quality, comfort and most of all, actual razor-close shave that this shaver gives me. Not only is it a close shave, but I'm able to comfortably, and completely get to the difficult-to-shave areas around my Adam's apple, something that the other companies never could do, and again a completely smooth shaving experience, never any pinching, even if I let the stubble grow for a week.<br /><br />It cleans up easily, has a natural grip/feel in your hand, and also works great as a wet shaver (but with my skin I prefer a dry shave). I can't speak to the long-range quality as I've only had this for a few months (a Christmas gift from the wife) but I'll be absolutely shocked if it gives me problems.<br /><br />If you're looking to replace your old shaver, stop searching and buy this one, you won't regret it!
B00AWKQWJQ|4|This mouthwash is excellent. Good flavor, good results. My teeth feel great after I use this.
B00EP4H8UM|5|These are great but don't expect a lot of curl unless you get the smaller ones.  People complained about their hair getting tangled and I had no problem with that and have long fine hair but a fair amount of it.  It is a great quick way to keep out the frizz if you are in a hurry to get somewhere and needed to wash your hair on the spur of a moment.  You will have good body in your hair as well.  Very worth the purchase for emergency situations.  Neat invention of the handle release......Thanks Amazon!
B00GNT4EW2|5|Very please no need to ever go to a nail shop will save a lot to time and money to come
B004BVYT2Y|5|I've been using these since  7 months ago, when I tried them as a last ditch effort in preparing for my first wedding at the age of 40.  As a female who has always taken care to wear sunscreen, eat healthy, not smoke, ect.. I was concerned about my inherited  laugh lines and jowels appearance.  And I needed a ~very~ low budget solution..<br />After only one practice run, I was more than happy with the performance of the lift!  Even with stress perspiration of the ceremony and after-events.  Clean skin and a few moments to put your hair up, ( use a second mirror to check where you parted your hair)  and you will  be looking at yourself 15 years ago.<br />Seriously, the only complaint I can come up with is that it doesnt like many hours of sweaty activity along with naturaly oily skin.  About 6-7 hours if you aren't being super hot/sweaty before any slippage occures..even then It barely affects the performance, and never, ever fails completely .<br /><br />This little item can actualy show you what you will look like when you can afford an actual lower face-lift!!<br />Thanks for reading, Dyanne
B004MCICJ8|5|It's work good !
B001V9SXXU|1|i have pretty bad eczema and although hydrolatum and aquaphor have been a life-saver in treating it, i thought i would try something new (especially since most of the reviews for this moisturizer were for the most part fantastic).  I'm sure it's a perfectly adequate moisturizer for normal skin... unfortunately i don't that luxury.<br /><br />if you have severely dry skin... this product sucks.  it's a waste of money.  it says formulated by dermatologists... but any dermatologist would know that severely chapped or dry skin and eczema would never be sufficiently treated by this cream.  i don't care how many different ingredients they used to create this recipe... it's crap.
B006WZ8T3W|5|I love these nail strips.  I actually use them with the solar top and solar light from the Sally Hansen solar strip kit and these work fine with it.  I coordinate the solids with a fun pattern on alternating nails and they are fun and funky.  I get about 7 or 8 days of use before changing which is better than regular nail polish gives me.
B00FH692PQ|5|I have tried several methods for stopping my considerable and ongoing thinning and hair loss and found nothing that worked for the long haul until I read about and tried Pura d'or Premium Organic argon oil shampoo.  I have been using it for six months, along with daily applications of Women's Rogaine to my scalp, and experienced a rapid reduction in the amount of hair that had been falling out in the shower or when brushing, combing and styling my hair.  It is either this product or a combination of the shampoo with the Rogaine that markedly reduced my hair loss.  It is not the Rogaine alone that worked for me, because I had been using that product by itself a few years ago, and found that it effected very little reduction in my hair loss.  So, needless to say, the results I have had using Pura d'or shampoo and Rogaine together have produced thicker, healthy and shiny hair with what I would call normal daily loss of a few hairs.  I am thrilled with the results I see when I look in the mirror!
B00B1OHKUM|5|Great product result oriented.
B0070Y8V0A|5|I got this for my daughter, she has suffered with acne since her teenage years. She has tried everything prescription including accutane. After her first use her acne improved and it helped with the dark spots. When she added the Clinique dark spot corrector twice a day to this regimen her face has almost totally cleared up. These two products have been miracles for her. She is 26 and nothing has ever worked like this except for the time she was on accutane. Truly a miracle!
B00DK0A5WA|5|Nice
B005KL2IAY|2|It made my hair look dirty no matter how much I used. the bottle even said to put it on dry hair..I would hate to see what that looks like
B000WOVIC8|4|it would be better to get the clear version as this colored/tinted version was a little too dark but the other one was not available at time of purchase.
B005P0T0UG|5|As with most naturals, I go through a whole lotta conditioner. Some don't have the best slip, so I use those for my co-washes. Some have incredible slip and are great at moisturizing so I keep those for regular conditioning after shampoos. Giovanni Smooth as Silk Conditioner is what I use for REAL moisturizing and detangling. It smells great and provides the slip I need to get my comb through this forest of curls with remarkable ease. Leave it on for about 10 minutes and it works even better. Though kinky curly hair does usually require more conditioner than straight hair (my curls laugh at the &#34;dime size&#34; amount recommended on most bottles), I have found that this product works so well, that I can use half the amount I use with other conditioners. I start by dividing my wet freshly washed hair into 4 sections and smoothing the conditioner on each one, combing through with a wide toothed comb, and then doing a quick twist when I'm done with each one. I then rinse my hair with the twists still in. When that's done, I can untwist each section and either add my favorite oil, gel or moisturizing product to each section and retwist, then spin them on either side of my head. The next day when my hair is dry, I'm rewarded with lovely, soft stretched out curls. This and Trader Joe's Nourish Spa Conditioner are my top picks for best conditioner for thirsty curls. Love this stuff and highly recommend it.
B002JLQWNM|5|This isn't really the sort of thing you buy without knowing that it works for you, and it really, really works for me. I've fought with my hair my whole life. When I was a kid, my ringlets would be brushed out, and my hair would frizz out like nobody's business. I fell into a straightening rut, then just started throwing my hair up in a bun or something. I've tried all the recommended curly hair stuff throughout my adult life, and I was pretty much resigned to have frizzy, undefined curls or frizzy, heat wrecked straight hair, when I finally gave in and bought some DevaCurl products. I was holding off because the price is prettttty high.<br /><br />The DevaCare conditioner is fantastic. I squish to condish with it and put a bit in at the end of my shower as it says on the bottle. The scent on this one is very fruity/candy like. The DevaCurl conditioner has a more salon-type smell to it. I've used both and haven't noticed a huge change in formula besides the scent, so I'd say if someone wanted to decide between the two, choose based on scent. This one has a scent very much like their gels. The DevaCare line is supposed to be for color treated hair, and I do dye my hair red. I also take hot showers despite knowing better. Even with squish to condish, leaving my conditioner in a long time, and the hot water, my color sticks around for quite a while. I think that switching to this brand has really helped me retain the red, which usually fades quickly for me.<br /><br />I use this every time I shower, and I use the no-poo every 3-4 (sometimes more) days. I also use the styling cream and the defining gels. The combination has my hair looking the best it ever has. My curls are defined, not frizzy, not crunchy, and just everything I wanted when I started looking to wear my hair how it grows. I highly recommend trying this brand if you have curly hair and nothing else has seemed to work in the past.
B0084GWCOE|5|I have naturally wavy hair. When I wear my hair straight I use the Moroccan oil hair treatment on my hair before<br />I blow dry and straighten. It works great!! Leaves my hair looking healthy.
B001A7AH1E|5|This leave-in treatement by Keristasse is tres chere (very expensive), but worth every penny to me because of the results:  Super shiny, lusturous, soft, manageable hair...every time!  Use after shampoo on wet hair and/or apply to dry hair at night for a fabulous wake-up hair surprize!  I'll always use this and other Keristasse products even if it means economising in other areas....They are WORTH IT!
B009909F3U|5|Such a great price for this shampoo. Much cheaper than in the salon or at the store. I would recommend.
B00YTPC9EW|5|I used Shima's Shea Butter and it was very pure, and soft. It mixed very well with her oil. Just rub it in your hands and it will melt quickly and then use a little on your hair. It works well with my natural hair. Should ve great for all textures.
B00ZMCE5U2|5|Such a beautiful comb! My beard loves it! Perfect! Fast shipping too!
B00564TEQG|5|I've been using Pura d'or for about 4.5 months now with minoxidil. My hair has been thinning for about 7 years and this is the first time I've attempted to do something about it. It's been working great! I'm now starting to see regrowth and thickening of my existing hair. I just received my second bottle of Pura d'or and will continue to use it as long as I am seeing results!
B00PR1BXRQ|1|Had an allergic reaction
B007OL72B8|5|I am new to wet shaving and I didn't want to cut my face up, so I took others' advice to get a trial pack. I looked for the least sharp blade (by reviews) in the pack to make sure I knew the right technique. (I started with the Derby). It worked well and I'm continuing to work my way through to see which is best for me. Great way to start. No cuts yet.    **Update** I just finished using this sampler pack. (Started February 14 and ended October 22) It was a good introduction to wet shaving. Some I was pleased with (most notably the Feather, Astras and to a lesser degree BIC) and lasted a month for me. Some others weren't very good at all, but over 8 months of shaving for this price is a win to me.
B000RSITSK|5|Excellent sealed package exactly as ordered.  Seller worked with me when USPS wouldn't recognize address.  Great product and sales transaction.
B0002D5Y92|5|The Panasonic ER421KC Nose and Ear Hair Trimmer works very well. The blades are very sharp so no pulling or tugging at hairs, and it has plenty of power. The light comes in handy. But don't think it shines right up the nose the whole time you're trimming; it does somewhat, but the main purpose of the light is to have it handy so you can turn it and check to see if you've missed anything. Quite possibly the best one I've ever owned.
B003EN4T2U|5|Can't stop using it.  The only thing that keeps my teen acne.  Has to be used regularly for best results.  Just good cleaning routine.
B002S8VF5G|3|not as great as ppl are describing it, doesnt work for me, not as smooth, very dry and doesnt spread evenly
B00620OTRM|5|love it... great product and fabulous delivery system of the mouthwash.
B004VA960K|5|Excellent power supply. Nice and heavy, doesn't feel like it was cheaply made. Runs very consistent, haven't had one single problem with it. The only thing that i could list as maybe a con would be that the nobs are VERY sensitive so dont crank it up too much when tuning your machine.
B006Y0DQP6|5|I was super excited for this to get shipped to me. Very fast delivery and I am eager to see the full results from using these products.
B006NDDXNE|3|I have used the original Hempz lotion for years and have always loved it! I was so excited to find out that there were more scents available, so I decided to try the Citrus Blossom.<br />I was super excited to get it and smell it, but the scent was much stronger than I prefer. It's an alright smell I guess, but the original is a much calmer and softer smell that I personally like 10 times more than this one. This lotion is also much more runny than the original, and didn't seem to soak into my skin like the original does. This leaves more of a greasy feel.<br />When I told my husband I wasn't a big fan of it he said he liked the smell fine, so instead of returning it he is using it up. (So maybe I'm just too picky)<br />I decided to try the Triple Whipped Hempz lotion after trying this and I LOVE it! I recommend that one of you want something thicker that sinks into your skin and doesn't leave a greasy feel. It smells a lot like the original too!
B00I2MH2V8|1|Horrible product. I wish I could give it zero stars. This stuck to my lip and didn't even come off when I tried to pull it. It broke into little pieces and I had a troublesome time getting the rest of the wax off my lip. It hurt and now my skin is red and sensitive to touch. DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT, DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY!!!!!!! You are better off letting a professional wax your moustache.
B00SNXTJUS|5|This is a beautiful palate with a nice mix of shimmer and mat colors. Also comes with blush and bronzer. Great Gift to give to someone, very affordable and great quality. There is are a wide variety of colors which is great, I can change my look almost daily with the colors! It is an all in one kit which I absolutely love, instead of heaving a few eyeshadows separate from blush and bronzer. I absolutely adore the leopard care, gives the make up set a great look especially as a gift. I enjoy that it also has lip colors, something I didn't know at first. I can easily combine colors to create a smokey eye look or plainly create a new color. Love this Make-up set. Everything in one!<br /><br />I was sent a free product sample for review. I was not paid or told what to write.
B00MJ0N6FA|5|Just recieved this the shipping timeframe was amazing, and this work GREAT as well
B00B5TNJP8|1|don't buy it its fake hair it burns when you iron it and the hair falls out
B003CNS3T2|5|What I expected.
B00BB8ZIRK|5|Always buy Remington, great features and super quality!
B00ARF44O6|5|Wasn't sure before buying if worth the investment, but it's a massive upgrade from my cheap trimmer and I really love it.<br />If I'd known the difference was so obvious I would have gone straight to this one instead of cycling through a couple of cheap ones first.
B00GKHE28S|5|This is a very nice product, the jade is of high quality and feels good in the hand.
B00J42G2UW|4|Great toothbrush, love the spinning action. Leaves teeth very clean.
B00BG15BTC|1|An ugly purple color
B0055AKQTU|5|Love the color
B003YP8XES|4|Contains all the good ingredients recommended by beauty experts in magazines and on-line.  I liked the feel and smell of the product, and felt it was a good in-between product for exfoliating skin.  I still think straight retinol A is probably the best Exfoliator, but it requires careful monitoring.  Skin perfection's product can be used nightly under moisturizer so it is easy to use.  Well worth the money when  you compare it to other wrinkle serums.
B005JYPCV4|4|Envelope Please is a beautiful mauvey pink- nothing like the first picture.  Not too bubble-gummy and very neutral, while still being pretty and girly. I really like this brand of gel polish, but I'm only giving it 4 instead of 5 stars based on the fact that if you do not paint your nails perfectly, the polish wont last 2-4 weeks like a professional gel mani. BUT this color is great. I will definitely wear it frequently.
B0016A1C0K|5|Great soap! Highly recommend.
B003O5QE58|5|This lipstick is so pretty people ask me what I have on.  It's a light to medium neutral pink color (neither warm nor cool but not brown) and would suit many people. It is moisturizing without being greasy.  I definitely recommend.
B00KU8FYN0|1|Doesn't work.
B00LM3L90Y|5|Amazing stuff! I was VERY skeptical and dealt with cellulite for a long time, but I was desperate and decided to give it a try! I was shocked and so was my husband! I love this stuff! Definitely ordering more!
B00DV82GCI|5|I Love these eye pencils, they really go on smooth with great color! I get a lot of compliments on my eye make up. I would recommend these eye shadow pencils. I'm purchasing more colors!
B00LNOKBYW|5|I love so many things about this curling iron! I have very fine hair, that is straight everywhere except for the waves in the back. So it always looks...off. But this curling iron solves the problems I've had in the past with curling irons.<br /><br />I used to burn myself, but with the curling chamber that doesn't happen anymore. Also, I have such fine hair that I usually use a fairly low temperature. However, my sister has VERY thick hair. She doesn't curl or straighten her hair often so she doesn't want to buy something of her own so it's nice that she can use this product as well since it has a variety of temperature settings. The LED screen makes it easy to see the temperature (and how far along the iron is in heating up) and direction of the curl.<br /><br />But my absolute favorite feature is the automatic timers. Whenever I curl my hair I'm really ambitious at the beginning. I'll have nice tight curls on one side of my head and by the other side I've gotten tired and don't hold them as long. So I look really uneven. This curling iron assures me that I hold all the curls the same amount of time and get even curls.
B00J5D8BY0|5|A++++++++++++++++
B00CDZG59K|5|My brother had finished his bottle of Mont Blanc a while ago so I thought a new bottle would make the perfect Christmas gift! I was right he loves the way it smells and so do I. It smells perfect it even came in a convenient travel case. The shampoo and after shave are also fantastic!  The shipping was fast!
B002PA2LNC|5|Wow, is this stuff good!  I have fine, thinning hair and no product seemed to make much of a difference in volume until I tried this. The trick is to find just the right amount to use.  Too little and the results will be mediocre.  Too much and your hair is a little on the dirty side (but still lots of body).  So I would recommend using too much at first and scale down until you find the perfect amount.
B004Y36B2U|5|The seller send me a broken one, but he replaced it fast.<br />I have one for years and we love it!<br />I know it's  been discontinued due to manufacturing problems, but I still search for it online.<br />Easy to use, soft air and not too hot!
B002DHA580|5|you ...... will ........... love .......... this ..................item ............ without ......... a ........ doubt ......... I ......... promise ........ you
B004J11POG|5|Excellent !!
B000IQVVGI|5|I love the smell of rose petals and the lather of this soap, and I enjoy feeling fresh and clean after using it. And it doesn't leave my skin feeling dried out like some of the cheaper fragrance soaps. The petals embedded in it seem to help me hold it in my hand while showering. Highly recommended to anyone enjoying true rose fragrance.
B004MKFY3W|4|I was fed up with shaving and the things that come along with it like after a few days you start to itch as the hair grows back, shaving bumps and razor burns. I decided to try Veet Cold Wax Strips because I didn't feel like warming anything up in the microwave or applying the wax myself using traditional wax methods... That whole process just seemed extremely messy... So, I was relieved when I came across Veet's ready to use wax strips. I will admit that my first attempt trying wax and failed miserably. I warmed it in my hand and followed the instructions but when it came to pulling it off myself I wasn't doing it fast enough, so nothing came off...  After 3 failed attempts I asked my husband to help I told him to go in the opposite direction that my hair is growing and when he did it, it was perfect. So I recommend asking someone else like hubby or boyfriend... Just make sure you inform or make them read the instructions. At first we did my stomach... I must admit we did have a few stubborn hairs that just would not go away... We just kept going until it MOST of it was gone and the rest I just plucked... Next up was my bikini line.... I was going for a brazilian wax sort of thing.. I wanted to be bare... But unfortunately it was much too painful. The hair is more coarse and hurts more down there so I gave up... So I look like a mess!!! I have Patches of bald spots right now lol...  Don't get me wrong, It works well... You just have to know what you're doing and be able to endure pain. If I ever attempt the bikini area again I will definitely get no scream cream (something I saw on youtube (you're supposed to apply it a little bit before you get waxed and it is supposed to take the pain away, lol go figure- but willing to try nething to get rid of the pain that goes along with waxing) and take some pain pills.... FYI: I've ever heard of some people using Orajel on the bikini line before they get waxed... which is weird to me... Idk.. So anyway, this stuff works well on fine hair like stomach area wasn't very painful for me at all but not so much with pubic hair because it's so coarse and skin is so sensitive... unless you can deal with the pain of going over the bikini area with the wax about 15/20 times.. wouldn't recommend this..  I am considering plucking my pubic hair one by one... Idk what to do.. If you have any advice please comment.. I am too shy to go to a professional plus I heard it's extremely expensive..l on fine hair like stomach area wasn't very painful for me at all but not so much with pubic hair because it's so coarse and skin is so sensitive... unless you can deal with the pain of going over the bikini area with the wax about 15/20 times.. wouldn't recommend this..

B003N21THK|5|Doesn't smell bad cleans my face really well and doesn't sting like some other products do
B003ZP5GFQ|5|Pulls those little hairs out right now.  It pulls a little, but nothing to hardly notice.  Beauty is worth it.
B004P2LL2K|1|What a horrifying result! This product leaves behind a white filmy grit all over your eye area. This looks ridiculous, and I would never go out in public with white smudges all around my eyes. I followed the instructions and even used the most minuscule amount possible and it still left the stains. Tried several times, and each time I inevitably had to wash it off. What a disappointment. It went straight into the trash today.
B004GT0CFY|5|Outstanding product provides natural but deep Tan.....
B001FORK7Q|4|Perfumes are personal.  Everyone has their own taste.  I prefer Italian or French products because I know they are derived from natural sources ~ not always true in American perfumes.  I suggest you go to a perfume counter and try different aromas and test them on your skin.
B00BVLAS0E|4|good product and easy sale expensive, but that's the brand
B00LU1V3JK|5|just received a day ago. I don't have much to say as of yet, since I have to give myself more time to see true result of using this eye cream. I can say it arrive in a timely manner, which I like and the packing was good. Also I like the consistency of cream, it goes on really nice and smooth and absorbed into the skin nicely.<br /><br />Update over two months:<br />This is a great eye cream compared to one's I used in past. First I'm 34 yrs old,  I never have wrinkle but my eyes looked so youthful and awakened... I absolutely like this cream and will buy again.
B000BUW8WM|3|It works really well, and gives a real decent shave; but even with the power on it doesn't really give that much better a shave than the Mach-3. If there is an improvement, it's negligible. Its head's a little bigger than the Mach-3 as well, which isn't a HUGE deal but it noticeable enough. I have used both side by side, and can safely say that both will give you a fantastic shave. It is also a cool looking blade. The battery-powered operation is just gimmicky and doesn't improve your shave a great deal.
B000W8JZIS|5|I have very dry skin and live in a very dry apartment.  This Bioelements is like putting on rich cream, thick and feels awesome.  It hasn't clogged my sensitive pores.  And so far has been nothing but good good good!<br /><br />You don't have to use a lot because it so thick and creamy.  Just three or four dabs around the face and then work it in.  I've never been impressed with a night cream until this one.
B005F9YMO6|4|These liners are great for those who are tired of waking up with unsightly red marks around your nose from using your CPAP machine.
B00NTRJ8RM|4|Took a while to get hear and fits a little loose.
B004ZMCUIO|5|Gives you total softness and strength like you've never had. I would definitely recommend this for any and all hair types. A little goes a longggg way with this product do the bottle will last u a long time! :)
B000UZS8RM|5|Attitude Cologne by Giorgio Armani, 2.5 oz Eau De Toilette Spray for men.     [[ASIN:B000PE8STQ Armani Attitude Eau de Toilette Spray, 2.5 oz.]]
B0082XRJXS|5|This box had lots of really great designs, easy clean up and great quality. I would defintely buy this brand again!
B00DLNVS4U|3|This is ok did make my Hair appear fuller but left a sticky feeling and hard to touch up with a Brush I thought I was mybe using to much so I used less and still had the same problem .I gave this product three stars because my hair did look fuller but didn't like the sticky feeling and also made my scalp itch .I love Alterna products but this wasn't for be but everyone's hair is different  so some my get great results.
B005M1S68U|5|Awesome 💕 💕  product for the most sensitive  skin, and skin conditions
B000C1VX6M|5|Good product good place to buy it from. Shipped out fast and packaged good. Would buy items from them again
B0048ZIM30|5|As a guy it's hard to find a black manly color but this is the closest thing. It's easy to use. Just plug in the battery and you are set. It's a very great deal on the price!
B001KYU2OE|1|Description is for 1 oz, product image clearly shows it is 0.5 oz. Also, why does 101 Medical list the same product so many different times with slightly different prices and names. Are they trying to avoid a realistic summary of reviews of their products?
B00LC94I8I|5|There is nothing that I don't like about this razor.  It has a great weight, fantastic gift box, and is truly a joy to shave with.  Keep it I Shaveology
B0086VI9TE|4|Pretty soft but does the trick. I wish they would specify the bristle type.
B003FXTYEW|5|My husband loves it.  It's a bit expensive and in a smaller container, but it does the job.  Will continue to order.
B0073W9IOC|3|Ehhhh, I have a love/hate relationship with this stuff. It's alright but, I truly don't feel that it's doing everything I need it to do for my face. Which is what I mainly use it for because I have extremely dry skin. It seems to keep it mostly moisterized but, then after it 'dries' it seems that my dry spots are just flaky and gross. This stuff seems to make my hair soft which is cool I could use this one for my hair and find a different coconut oil for my face I had just hoped this would solve my issue of having to have two different types of coconut oil.<br />Overall, I'd just do the research and just get a different brand. Trader Joe's organic coconut oil seems to be everyone's favorite so that's gonna be my next choice!
B00ARF44P0|5|It took me about 1/2 way through the first cut to get the hang of it but I love it now.  I keep a buzz cut and the guard adjust just right.  Since it takes me about 1/2 the time as my old wahl beard trimmer I cut my hair more often.  Charges quickly and holds charge well.  I cut my hair about twice a week and have only charged it twice in 5 months.
B005V2UHIW|4|I've been learning a little bit about essential oils and thought this one would be a good try... looking forward to using it, it was delivered in about a week or less.
B002DPUXZC|5|This stuff is great for winter hand issues. I used to have a lot of problems with raw knuckles cracked and bleeding an very sore. Now once the temp starts dropping (Northern VT) I start using it right on thru to April or May.<br /><br />Burts was bought by a large cosmetics company a few years ago and it seems to me that the smell is not quite as strong and the mixture is now better emulsified. It used to be that a squeeze would sometimes get you a bunch of liquid that was not mixed in properly. Have not had that happen on last few tubes.
B003J9WA02|5|everything is fine
B001ET7C3O|5|As advertised.
B00152TXAK|1|So old they were discolored and stiff
B000YOSI6U|3|Perhaps too strong for sensitive skin it leaves a residue of glue on your skin you must work to get off and irritated the skin slightly.  Need to use for special ocassions only.
B003O7IBZC|5|My husband, baby, and toddler all get very dry skin/eczema especially in the winter.  This works great for them all.  Completely clears it up after a week of once a day use.  For the kids, i put it on at bedtime before i put them in their footed pajamas and in the morning their skin is still moist from the lotion.  Very moisture intensive!
B0017TZD7S|5|Perfect
B004SU8EKG|5|Makes my hair look great!  I used it this morning and I think I have had this things for a couple years.
B005YXU3ZA|5|I love cinnamon flavored candy and these are wonderfully flavored. So good!
B00G5DCC2U|4|If you are consistent in applying the product as directed it works I just didn't see completely results because I wasn't consistent.
B0000DH8OW|2|doesnt work well
B0020C6DHK|4|good stuff, this is the best kept secret in the foundation world and I want it to stay that way.
B004TGP2HC|3|I wish I could love this stuff as it smells amazing. The bugs (ants and gnats) around my yard must not realize they are not supposed to LIKE this spray. I didn't end up with any bug bites, but I felt as though the gnats swarmed to me. I sprayed my hair and body, and it left my hair a bit on the greasy side as well. As good as this stuff smells, I felt the need to shower after applying it. I will try it again in the future, for a longer period of time, it just is not enjoyable having gnats swarm your face.<br /><br />It is also a lot cheaper elsewhere.
B001M1JC6O|5|The Heated Shaving Cream dispenser was exactly what I expected.  Great value for the price!  I highly recommend this dispenser.
B004D2C57M|5|THIS IS THE ONLY PRODUCT THAT I'VE TRIED THAT SEEMS TO WORK, AND I'VE TRIED ALOT.  I WOULD RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT TO MY FAMILY AND FRIENDS.
B006RBH6QC|5|I use this ink it worked well and color stuck to the skin I got it on time its a great product
B000136P78|1|I received my Finishing Touch Razor last week. Was suppose to get a free compact mirror with the purchase as advertised which was NOT in the box, also the light did not work. Called the company several times, got a different answer each time. Still have the broken razor, out $23.00. Live and learn is my motto now.
B0049LUI9O|5|Works well! Great design!
B008YD68Q0|4|I used to buy the cheap knock-offs,  but they did not last long at all.  A couple of them had the rotating head break off soon after use.<br /><br />Now I have returned to the original manufacturer,  and am satisfied.  Yes,  it's much more expensive,  but  lasts longer and is way better built.
B005PMZPXK|5|Nice and cheap, i enjoy this perfume so much
B0073SBONO|5|Worked wonderfully showed up on time
B000068PBT|5|Delivered as promised and met all expectations.
B003X8749G|5|I love this stuff and can't find it anywhere in my local stores.  I can throw it in my purse and it never leaks all over like some of the other cuticle treatments.
B00F31M96Y|5|Good for the dry skin type, use it before the bedtime . After use do not need to wash it ,it's worth to try
B004KZMKJK|3|I ordered this package containing all this described articles, pretty much got what i was expecting, just one little thing, the compressor gets really hot when working with it and it does not have a internal fan to kewl it,<br />you might have to get an external little fan, also the inks are not that good as it is supposed to be a temporal tattoo, it will fall of the skin in 6 hours even less if swimming, over all a pretty good and none expensive combo.
B005G41APY|3|Kind of sickening sweet. I love their musc much better.
B00450MNBU|4|Awsome straightner its one of the best it leaves my hair soft and very straight..i love it but sometimes it doesnt get as hot.
B007HJ9VFM|4|My wife uses it all the time
B00H1273FA|3|Didn't care for it. Bummer because it's not inexpensive, but hey, nothing ventured nothing gained!
B0000AOWPC|4|This cream is good, but not wonderful, and is a bit expensive.  It does not smooth on as easily as I would like, but does make my skin feel good.
B008YMHXRE|1|I can't believe what this 'shipper' did to me! I actually spent an additional $35.00 for overnight delivery which did not arrive on time. But that ended up not being an issue after I opened the box. This bottle had been opened before it left the facility, did NOT come with the can like it's supposed to, and was a huge mess as it had spilled inside the package! I am FURIOUS! I highly recommend that no one buy from this shipper. This is a 'personal' item that I guess someone felt the need to use prior to me. Disgusting! Unfortunately for me they caught me in between moving from my home, and traveling, so I did not have the chance to return it and demand my entire $35.00 expedited shipping charge back. I have been completely ripped off. Just opening the box left my hands an oily mess, had to wash them before I could touch anything, it was a MESS! There aren't enough words for how angry I am! Furious doesn't even begin to cover it.
B004VFXVJW|5|If you use this properly it's an awesome mirror for the shower. Once the water is hot, just hold the mirror under the stream for about 30 seconds and it wont fog up at all. Perfect for shaving. Love this thing.
B00J2APFMW|4|The razor can get to places most can't but I did have a little more razor burn than normal. Overall good razor.
B006H9J4VY|5|I've been looking for an organic tooth paste that still gets the job done and I've been very pleased with this product. One thing I've noticed is that after using it at night the next morning my husband's and my breath wasn't bad! Which is different compared to regular tooth paste we've tried and had to continually brush thought the day (up to 4X) this we only use at night and maybe once throughout the day.
B0009OAH96|3|This does smell like a woman's perfume, in fact it smells exactly like perfume I've smelled on women.<br />I would advise as a man going with something like Cool Water, you'll actually appreciate the sandy<br />beach ocean spray smell, and women tend to like it as well, rather than this.<br /><br />I will say this though, the perfume is strong and you don't need much, but I wouldn't recommend it<br />for a man.<br /><br />It is nice though and I imagine the ladies love the smell of it on a man which is maybe what they<br />intended, but I would like to enjoy the smells I'm putting on as well :)
B00IMNLC6S|5|Holds a charge longer than any I have owned.  It gives me a good shave and I use the trimmer feature to take care of unwanted hair.  Good bargain.  I thought the price was too low for a quality shaver, but I was pleasantly surprised at the features and the ease of operation here.
B003CJP13W|5|no toning, but skin becomes soft and prepared
B006PCEU3U|5|I love it!  Not greasy and smells great, kind of an aroma therapy for me. I started out with ordering just samples, went to an 8 oz tube and now a 32 oz tube.
B001A7YGS4|1|This item came without the factory seal!!  Who knows whats inside?<br /><br />Again ripped off!<br /><br />This place is a joke!  screw them
B00KHYKVFS|5|I 've tried several serums and this one is the best!
B005852DDO|3|Excellent
B000VL8ADM|5|Feels great on your face. And it doesn't take much , about the size of a dime to cover your whole face. You need to take care of your face , you only got one.
B005FY1A1O|5|Does exactly what the description says - legs are soft smoothe & silky.  Helps give an extra close shave.  I wish they made a travel size.
B005JPNYEU|4|Good quality shea butter. No scent, refined, worked perfectly in lip balm and body butter recipes. Was pure white and in random pieces in container, not one huge piece as pictured, just so people are aware of what they will receive.
B000JLEUVA|5|excellent product, rich fragrance as ever, hard one of my favorite brands, very fresh scent unmistakable.excuse my English.satisfied with the seller
B0016PZVZM|5|Purchased this for my friend. She loves the product. Said it was cheaper on Amazon.
B00IUFR5YG|5|Well packaged beautiful crown that arrived quickly considering it's coming from oversees.  Appears bigger in the picture but I read the measurements before ordering.  Would definitely order again.
B00GZ8DUIK|5|I absolutely love this, came in a couple days when ordered with prime! I should of got the matte top coat.
B00CNOUZE2|5|Does not fog up, even after being in the shower for 30minutes and the entire bathroom is a sauna
B0057542W0|4|Great concealer. I use it on an age spot and under my eyes to hide dark circles.  I absolutely love this concealer!  The only negative is that a lot comes out with each pump so I end up with a lot of wasted concealer.  One pump would cover almost my entire face.  I try to only push the pump down a little way but still end up with way too much concealer.
B0018QHY0Y|5|this eyeliner is amazing! All my eyeliners would smudge or sometimes not even mark at all! But this is amazing. It defines your eyes better
B000KOHSQA|2|This product is a pain in the rear for me. I have super long hair so not only did I waste my money with two boxes, but It was difficult to kee the blonde from bleeding onto my &#34;brown&#34; (that was more like a reddish brown) The way the box read, it was supposed to be super easy...NOT!
B001ADOTYY|1|thick sticky not antthing like described-no sense returning them because that would cost more money-just dont buy it-go to CVS so you  CAN return it
B005CNQFCW|5|Love this set. Love OPI. Very fun
B00KQPFG1C|4|The eyeshadows work great, especially when you apply primer first! However, when I did receive my palette, there was loose eyeshadow dust everywhere. Overall I still love this product!
B00AE07IGK|4|we use. Dove soap all the time. We do't use any particular \\"special\\" type such as Restore. So it was interesting to see if Restore was any different.<br /><br />We also don't generally use soap for washing hair; we use shampoo for that, as do many people.<br /><br />Resotre is every bit as good as any of the Dove soaps, which is to say it is very good. IT leaves a clean and refreshed feeling, and the scent is not too much, but just enough to be pleasant. In Restore, the coconut oil isn't overposering either.<br /><br />So what about the hair conditioning properties claimed in the advertising? We really couldn't tell about that, though we gave it a try. I think you would have to use this soap long term to really tell, but using the single sample bar that we were sent, we couldn't really tell. In any case, it's doubtful that it will be better than a carefully chosen shampoo.<br /><br />I rate this product 4 stars rather than 5. It is 5 star quality, but one off for the overly enthusiastic advertising claims.
B000PVPEFU|5|One of the best, most natural blushes on the market!
B00IT1ECBA|5|This soap has a pleasant, but not overpowering, lavender scent. Very natural smelling compared to the harsh chemical fragrance of typical liquid soaps. And it leaves my hands feeling good, not drying like others I've used.
B0017K81ZI|5|They have a shimmer that is very pretty! They make a difference on your eyes while looking very natural.
B009NPOXT2|1|I love pink sugar. However this seller is not selling pink sugar. Several people told me I smelt like alcohol. Not very good in the work force.
B006GQYSGE|4|very good razor, you can use it to shave both dry and wet (gel foam), it is really nice and quite but have some problems in trimming the neck area but over all it is very impressive razor
B0062IWQVU|3|I was supposed to receive this item as part of a Gillette promotion and write a review.  I would love to review except item was never received.  I am supposed to write a review but when I contacted the promotion they said it was mailed and didn't have any replacements.  I am trying to keep my end of the bargain regardless.  I can say that it looks like a interesting good product.  What I am really concerned about is how long it would last?  I would like to see other reviews on this question.<br />Thanks,
B001KYVXP6|2|Wish they still had the charcoal gray available. this is a little light but better than brown or blonde.   Update:   I find that this pencil is too hard and breaks too easily.     A better product is NYC Taupe Brow pencil. It is a dynamite color for this gray-haired lady and applies more softly.   I use the Maybelline pencil over it to smooth out any 'glops' left by the NYC pencil.
B00KHA1S4U|4|I found Assuage Natural Hair Gel by accident as I surfed through various gels.  Based on its description, I decided to try it.  It's been almost a month now that I've used it every day, so I am basing my comments on past experience.  Usually I shy away from gels as they tend to be too stiff, but this one leaves my short, wavy/ curly hair defined, yet soft and shiny.  Alrhough it's true that the ingredients list has chemicals in it, it seems the naturals are the ones that come through for my hair.  Also, the next morning my hair still feels soft yet it still has style; I really wouldn't have to wash and style it again, differently,  if I didn't have time.  My only disappointment is that I don't experience any aroma at all from the bergamot oil. But, having said that, I intend to continue using this product as it's the best one I have found so far.
B00JLA8Y6W|5|Perfectly stretchy and no glued seams. I pitched all my other &#34;seamless&#34; bands, including every one I ever purchased from Goody, because these rock. Can't beat the price either. Have super fine hair and these stretch and hold my ponytails perfectly. With the amount of bands included, you won't need to purchase hair ties for a LONG time.
B00BEUAZTG|5|We have tried just about everything for our 2 girls and finally found a product that works well for both of them!! I received 1 kit for free to try and when we decided we liked the product very well I went out and purchased a few more sets.
B004URZADG|4|Bought these to replace HQ 5 heads for a 15 year old 5885XL. The HQ 5 heads are impossible to find at any cost.Prior years I was able to buy through Amazon for around $28.00 These HQ56 heads fit & work fine even though my razor is not listed as compatable. Cost on these was arounf $18.
B00KQTZ5HI|4|Pretty colors, most are somewhat metallic sheen, buttery feel, fairly pigmented, but would not purchase again because I think the Urban Decay shadows are more pigmented and really shows up on my eyes with very little product or effort.
B008I2IKMW|4|Best price ever for these replacement heads.  I gave them 4 stars because I don't know if I'll have the same issue others have experienced with the bottom brush coming off.  I have NEVER had this happen with any heads I've bought in a store.  Time will tell if that happens with any of these.  Maybe I just know how to use them correctly.  Two weeks of use & no issues so far.
B008A3YGAE|5|2 coats was plenty, it was the perfect shade and it's my boyfriends favorite shade if nail polish that I have and I have a lotttt. Came a little late in the mail but I can't complain. (:
B009NNFB0O|5|Purchased this for my husband. His beard was so out of control and scratchy. After just one application his beard was like a whole new beard. It was so much softer and much more tamed with those unruly stray hairs. Absolutely going to purchase this again!
B001F51TOU|4|I have tried other drug store brands of body lotion, and found that Olay Quench Body Lotion seems to be the best for me so far. Even though it says \\"shimmer\\", but it seems to have minimal in it which I don't mind much. I actually prefer no shimmer because that might not be even healthy to you other than looking shimmery. This product does provide descent moisture to your skin for the first few hours.You can feel that your skin is subtle and soft. But you would just need to keep applying maybe a few times per day. I like the light scent of it.<br />One complaint though: the price here is much higher than elsewhere.
B001928CCQ|5|I found this natural nipple butter to be soothing, cooling, healing, and smells great! It works very well - I've had no problems the entire time I've been breastfeeding and using this! Will be keeping well stocked with this at home! Love that it's vegan, too - no lanolin.
B00O9FLMSQ|4|I received the product for free or a discounted amount for an unbiased and honest opinion....<br /><br />My skin is very oily. My entire face is oily on a daily basis.  These oil absorbing sheets work well. You will never know how oily your face really is until you have use one of these just to see if there is oil present. Using these will find all the  oil on your face and absorb it right into the paper thin sheet.  These are great for traveling.  You'll never know when you might need one
B00FZESMKG|5|I've used this facial wash for a couple of weeks now.  I have sensitive skin and I am trying to use more natural products.  The smell of this is pleasant, not too strong and it washes off my make-up well.  I use it daily and it leaves my skin feeling soft.  It is a small bottle but I believe it will last quite a while since I only need one small drop to wash my entire face.
B00005304H|5|Exactly what I was looking for.....great item!!!
B002SQ14AO|4|I bought this for my husband to use and he has been using it everyday for three weeks. I have seen a difference. He had dark circles under his eyes and he was getting noticeable crows feet at the corners of his eyes. The dark circles are very minimal now and the crows feet are less visible as well. The wrinkles that were very deep are still there, but the smaller ones can't be seen now that we're just starting to form. I will update this later if the deeper ones fade as well. The price on amazon of $29 w/ free shipping is a very good deal as this product sells for $36 in retail places (Macy's, Sephora, etc). The tube is very small for the price and with everyday use I would guess you would be buying this every 2 months. It's been a little over 3 weeks and it feels like he is about halfway through the tube. I'm not positive we will continue to buy due to the price. If we keep seeing improvement, then we will. I will update in the future.
B00N0OGHXW|5|great and you cant beat the price
B00H9D7XLU|5|Fantastic color.  Loved it back then an now.  Classic color.
B00PFEFTWK|2|It doesn't work. Followed all the instructions, gray at temples and in front of ears still the same color as when I started - gray.
B00FV9PK0U|5|This can be used with Calgel base and OPI is a great product, can also mix the colors to make new colors
B004O17UJ0|4|Works great in a hurry. This is one of the best products I used to cover grey. Highly recommend this.
B00BFSZENY|4|Good stuff on a bad hair day.
B00D0NMM6Y|4|The shipping was fast but I don't recommend buying bc it's very hard to apply it's very thin and it's hard to see if you applied it evenly since it becomes clear as soon as you start applying. Also I wish it was blue or red but not black, bc when not applied evenly it just looks like you got your hands dirty when you eat something cold or stay in the cold ac room. Unless u like challenges and have the patience to do 3 layers of it on top of your 4 other layers of gel manicure.
B0093363BK|5|Xmas presents for my boys. They were a huge hit! even for teenage boys. They are still working very well.
B001711FMI|5|I've read the other reviews and thought and giving it a try.  After splashing some in my hair and face it felt super cool and refreshing.  I really enjoy that menthol feel.  It smells like I just left the barber shop.  I'm disappointed that my local Barbara Beauty Supply doesn't carry it.  Great Stuff!
B0015KO3L6|5|This is my favorite among the Dial body washes. The good smell stays on your body even after showering. I always love the smell of this particular body wash.
B003RP6OUU|5|Great product! Super easy to use!!!
B006NDDXNE|5|First time buying already planning on buying more i never finish a bottle of lotion because I have psoriasis and everything ends up irritating my skin but this is amazing AND smells amazing! I'm only ever able to buy unsented lotion because of my psoriasis but this doesn't cause any irritation at all I LOVE it!
B00A014AZA|1|I purchased the &#34;Too Faced Lava Gloss&#34;because this particular eyeliner glides on smoothly.  The item I received does not represent what I purchased at Sephora in the past.  I am not sure whether this is expired or counterfeit, but this is not the same quality product I expect from Too Faced.  It is cakey and does not glide on smoothly at all.  The seller would not refund me, so I I contacted Too Faced directly.  They said &#34;All Cosmetics Boutique&#34; is NOT an authorized retailer.  Be warned!
B004LF1WWK|5|This product refreshes  your lower eyelids and it feels good....on time
B00KRBLD1C|4|The manufacturer NEEDS to make it clear that this oil CAN be edible. The labeling was conflicting, and I had to rely on other reviewers.
B001MA0QY2|4|This product worked great.  Best flat iron I have ever purchased, and for such a great price! I would recommend this product.
B0013OFRKA|5|I haven't been diagnosed with any sort of skin condition, but this still works for me. I have a problem with itchy skin after I shower, and I find that if I apply this and wash it off just before I get out of the shower, my skin hardly itches at all afterwards.
B0042867VW|5|I have ordered many of this product for my family and friends. all of them are satisfied with the quality. they have been using this for more than 2 years and it still works like the first day.
B009SR9Z4I|5|Product as described . Fast shipping
B00433VFV8|4|This is a very pretty blush for my fair skin.<br /><br />Leaves a really healthy glow to your face.<br /><br />I always get compliments about how well I look when I wear this shade.<br /><br />A little goes a long way and the shade is buildable.
B000GLRREU|4|Nothing cleans like the water pic. I gave it a 4 because I like more water pressure than this model puts out.
B003RUOMHC|3|this blade is hard to zero gap even w/ the tool. btw, i had to request for the tool from wahl (it's free, just call em and ask for the t-blade tool). supposedly, this blade comes zero gapped from the factory.. but can we really believe them?? Haha!!! anyways, i really dig the rotary motor... it runs alot cooler than the traditional motors. i still prefer my Andis T-Outliners but when using the Andis for several clients in a row, the blade can become super hot!!! this is when i bust out the Wahl Detailers!
B003H4IIH8|4|Great for people who have had spinal back surgery.  Only<br />complaint is the sponge attached wore out too quick. The<br />glue on the sponge let go and the material tore.  You can<br />get replacement heads at a fee.
B0002DOX80|5|Wow...this is just as good, if not better than expected. Over the years I have found it SO hard to find a &#34;taupe&#34; with NO red in it...that shouldn't be hard if something is CALLED taupe, but it is. This product is a true taupe and looks so natural...I do wet it a bit and it goes on perfectly. I'm done with pencils! I can also tell this is going to last a LOOOONG time which makes it a very good value.
B00K2501KM|5|Perfect, my daughter loves them.
B00373HQYK|5|I bought this from Luxxe Beauty. I was very happy with the reasonable shipping cost since I live outside USA. Anyway, I love E.L.F lip glosses, that's why I decided to try other E.L.F product. This bronzer is a pleasant surprise. I love the sheer colours. It's not too shimmery yet it makes my face look glowing. I've always been inspired by Jennifer Lopez's golden perfect glow on her cheeks. Now I can have a subtle and healthy glow on my cheeks too! The only bad thing about this bronzer is that it only lasts up to 5 hours or so (maybe because I have combination skin and I live in a hot & humid climate). Problem solved when I wear pre make up base though. It's more long lasting than when I wear it alone. I'll definitely try other colours in the future! You can't beat the price :)
B000H702GS|5|Love MAC lipstick.
B00022WA9K|2|This styler seemed great out of the package, and it works well at drying hair. However, it RIPS OUT MY HAIR! Where the metal brush and plastic end meet, my hair gets caught and torn out of my scalp! This is an obvious design flaw, and although I try my best to keep my hair out of the crevice, at least once each time I style my hair, it gets caught in the end and rips out of my head. It also gets caught where the metal brush meets the handle, but not as often as the crevice on the end. The last time I used it this happened four times, so I am returning it!!
B00LGLTWYM|5|I have always loved this brand. I don't think I would ever use any other.
B007TFKDBK|5|These products are the best in my opinion, I have ordered them for years and i will continue to do so. The seller mailed the items in a timely manner and they were as expected.
B00CGNQ15C|5|This cover was actually for my boyfriend, he likes it a lot it is very good quality and its looking good.
B00BFFQMBA|5|The ingredients of this product alone assures that it will bring nothing but positive results. Keratin is known for accelerating hair growth and slowing down the process of hair loss. For those who suffer from thinning hair, it is recommended to use products with Keratin in them. All of the other minerals and herbs will only strengthen the hair that is already present and the hair that will grow in.
B004DFOY46|5|I have been using Arnica for awhile now and I recommend it for dry, cracked heels. I was surprised to find it on Amazon but then again Amazon is a company I can always count on.
B0077LAJT2|5|perfect, thank you
B00LNGP8GQ|4|Worked pretty well. I have very dark hair and no powdery spots after application and working it through to get the oily parts of my scalp! I like that it is not overwhelming in fragrance, too. I don't like any perfumes to clash with my lotions!
B001B2QJSS|5|Had to buy a case of this because I believe they are discontinuing it.  This is the only deodorant that doesn't give me a rash all the way down my sides to my waist.
B000068PBT|5|REPLACED OLD HEADS AND IT IS LIKE A NEW SHAVER
B0067F8BBM|4|The brushes are very soft to the touch. I have really sensitive skin, and these worked perfectly! I was a little disappointed that the set did not come with all 32 pieces. The brushes are dirty and have some dust on them so I would suggest cleaning them before use.
B0055J4OVC|1|I ordered this product because of its natural ingredients and lack of toxic ingredients.  It is greasy and slippery, but I was willing to overlook that if it was effective and non-toxic. Unfortunately, after 3 days of using the product, I broke out in a rash all over my arms and legs.  I would warn anyone with sensitive skin away from using this.
B00HALFUS4|5|No one knew it was a wig
B004AGT0HO|5|I first discovered this eye cream at Sephora as a point freebie this past December.  I noticed a difference in my undereye dark circles and fine lines inside of a week.  A little goes a long way even using twice a day, every day.
B00IXWRPZK|3|This hair was just ok
B0002AHY6Q|4|My dental hygentist recommened this for my back teeth bc flossing every day wasn't doing it for me.  I've added it to my routine and seems to be going well.  Hard to get the hand of the water going everywhere and running down your chin and arm but if it keeps my gums healthy I'll take it.
B00HLQY13S|5|Very similar to the Rita Hazan product.  Good price too!
B000RLG8JE|5|Excellent tool...Absolutely will save your teeth!
B001UIQ2QC|4|I really like this mudd! My hair is straight & fine. If I want my hair to have body with a scrunchy look, I use this. After just reading the ingredients I gave this 4 stars because of the parabens & fragrance. However, this jar lasts a long time!
B00PYMVPEY|5|In additional of the serum we both from same brand, this will help more on the wrinkle around eyes and neck. my wife loves it, it works!
B0061YRVOC|2|I guess you get what you pay for.  Not impressed. The few feathers in this kit are very short. The other &#34;feathers&#34; (not sure what the material is) are cheap. Package was also missing beads.  Kind of a pointless kit if you don't have the beads to put the &#34;feathers&#34; in your hair.  Would not recommend this kit.
B008HBMRIC|5|I absolutely adore this line by Burts Bees. I use the mask, the night cream, the cream cleanser, and the day lotion. All are wonderful at moisturizing my dry skin. I love the light herbal scent.
B000WZSWZ8|5|I could not believe the price of one of favorite scents. It is intimate, sensous, and feminine, without being over powering.
B00886JONC|5|The best !
B00ID8HBJ4|5|I have a similar product with a smaller barrel.  It creates great ringlet curls.  I was wanting to create more of a wavy look.  This did the trick!
B00IDWP4IA|5|I am using this in conjunction with the hyaluronic acid serum by InstaNatural. It doesn't irritate my skin or make me break out. I will usually know after one application if something is going to give me bumps and acne. It has brightened my complexion and minimized my pores.
B006HACW9E|5|I give the seller and perfume 5 stars  ..arrived on time packaged really nice and the perfume smell is just lovely it has a beautiful scent ..  i will buy from this seller again .. the price for the perfume very reasonable plus its the real deal ..not a knock off .. so yes Ill buy again from this seller .. and the scent is so soft an lovely
B002AMUGGE|5|After trying many other less expensive creams, this Sisley cream delivers a beautiful foundation for make-up for my aging skin!
B001MCBVEO|5|This is the best smelling perfume.  I love the way it smells especially on my girlfriend. Not only do me and the GF love it but anyone and everyone that is anywhere near the vicinity of her when she wears it has to ask who is it that smells sooo gud?  My GF doesn't like to tell poeple what perfume shes wearing because she wants to keep this perfume a secret. This perfume can go with any occasion as well.  I highly recommend this perfume to all the women out there.  If you're a guy reading this you need to buy this perfume for your woman.  I promise you and your woman wont be disappointed.
B0014WJLPS|5|Product was shipped quickly.  This is the second tube that I have bought in just over a year!  It lasts a long time and really works!!  BTW - this last bottle was less expensive than the first too!  Extra bonus!
B000KL4QLI|5|This color goes with everything and when mixed with another color it's even better. Pleased with my purchase on this one.
B0015K9BXQ|5|Easier to use than regular clippers, especially when clipping your own hair.  Just remember to use the correct attachment.  Holds charge well.
B00JJNZAAY|5|Worked great and easy to use with wonderful results!
B00A99XF0Y|4|it was leaking. smell good. packing not good.
B004XJO59Q|5|Love, love L'Oreal Rich Lip Color especially the Mystic Mauve.
B004FPPVV4|5|I got it in the mail 4 days after and i was worried that some might be broken. I was so happy everything is intact, was wrapped well with bubble and non of the shadows are broken. Been using it for a week now and impressed with the product...it does really good consedering it's a cheap price. Highly recommend this product!
B00CD1QU80|5|I had one that was more expensive  and this one seemed to shave better I am well satisfied with the razor
B003BG1A6I|5|Satisfecha
B00FDNCR7S|5|I bought four of these in different colours and I love them. So soft, so warm or fresh because of the silk fabric. Looks casual or clasic when dressed with the proper look.  Take good care of them , are  delicate
B0046KFZC8|5|I have a dyed white &#34;patch&#34; in my greying hair.  Unfortunately, it would change to a yellow tone over time.  My hair stylist recommended a &#34;purple&#34; shampoo and I started looking online for reviews/recommendations.  I chose this after reading reviews on Amazon and other site.  This is a great product.  I use it just once a week unless I spend lots of time out in the sun -- then I may use it twice in a week.  I will definitely keep using this product.<br /><br /> I have had no problems with it staining our white shower pan or light colored shower tiles as others have mentioned.  I haven't let it dry on anything, but the staining of the shower has not been a problem at all.
B0084BPHIM|5|These are awesome tweezers...and for the price you cannot go wrong...my neices will have an easy time putting the faux crystals on their nails. Don't hesitate to order these...shipping was super fast too. thanks!
B004GVC0B6|5|Bought many times and always happy with the service and the product!
B000ZFUP0U|1|I searched for and bought these as a pairing. I thought I was replicating a Paul Mitchell product I found and used in the Mariott Courtyard Hotels. They were not only not the same but the conditioner is so thick you can't easily squeeze it from the container. Out of frustration, I will discard them
B00OGNF62E|5|Received oil very quickly. Enjoying it as this is my 4th or 5th bottle. Just wish bottles were larger.
B000TDBJHQ|5|Absolutely love this product.. jus dont use to much.. a little goes a long way
B00DP8K892|5|It was just what I wanted.  they no longer sell it in stores so I was so happy when I found this  Thank you
B004GEXU5S|4|Great product but don't overuse as it tends to be very drying.
B004TDVUVW|5|i love it so much that it's gone. gotta find me another bottle :P<br />Smells like musk vanilla. reminds me of a woman's night out. (if that makes any sense)
B000EN7LE6|5|This is an amazing product.  I would definitely reccommend anyone to buy this and use it!
B007AG3540|5|Blank
B003WR3QSG|5|This is a wooden handled, badger-hair shaving brush, pretty much exactly as expected. There's really not a whole lot to say about this.
B007HDK9LI|5|I cannot say enough good things about this product. I thought I had tried everything out there, but all of it was difficult to apply and didn't last more than a couple hours.<br /><br />This is FABULOUS. It lasts nearly all day for me, and that's even with me using eyedrops every hour or so.<br /><br />The color goes on easily and smoothly without any struggle and really stays in place. I even look hot the next morning if I don't wash my face the night before.
B00VKHKH8C|3|too soon for any changes
B004H0ZX2Y|3|Rapid delivery, so no complaints in that department.  the moisture content is not too great, still left me needing an added moisturizer mixed in.  The problem for me is that the color that I see and the color of the tint do not actually match.  I use a tinted moisturizer in place of foundation as I get quite tanned in the summertime due to my olive complection.  The color posted is close to my face color, but when I put it on, it is much lighter.<br /><br />It is okay...just keep in mind, it is 1 or 2 shades lighter than shown.
B000SSG07Q|5|I have used it exactly 3 days and I am blown away!<br />The product does say you should start with one time a day and work it up to 3, but I of course jumped in and started with 3-4 times a day. Maybe that is why my results are so fast. But the second day I already noticed the difference. Forget the scrubs and exfoliators, I have spent so much money on them just to get not very good results. By the second day my pores were so much smaller I had to google the product again because I was confused if this product is known for delivering such good results or maybe it's something else. Yep - it's this little miracle product. By the 3rd day they pores were not even noticeable. Peeling took place somewhat but I knew it is very drying product and I apply extra moisturizer accordingly.<br />This product is not that big - it's 4 oz. To make sure it lasts little longer I don't use cotton ball. This way this little product should last me few months!<br /><br />I am so happy with this that I am considering buying one of those expensive Obagi starter kits. This is a \\"Wow\\" product.
B00ARTK95A|5|I was going to purchase the new Sonicare Diamond Clean but after reading the bad reviews of product not being reliable considering it's made in China I'd figured just to stick with Oral-B electric brushes and I believe it's the best decision I made while also saving almost 70 dollars from purchasing  the Sonicare. This brush does the exact same task, and has the same options as the Diamond Series from Sonicare, but it's even better since this product is very well made and the electric mechanism inside the brush is manufactured by Braun which is a very reputable manufacturer of shavers, trimmers and etc. This brush is made in Germany so I know it will last just as long as my previous Triumph toothbrush which is over 3 years old but still going strong. So take my advice and ranting and just buy this product and I promise that you will not regret this decision.
B00GWF4AS0|5|Gentle but effective!!!
B000IKCLTA|5|This is the best for excema, dry skin, rosacia, etc.  My mom has rosacia and this is the only cream that takes care of it!
B004WDV2XA|1|Nope never going to buy it .
B007KJ04EG|5|I have oily and dry skin....this hydrates great without overdoing it! So light so fresh!
B000WHNI2I|1|Based on Amazon reviews I bought these brush heads at the same time I bought the Sonicare HX6711/02.  I am unhappy that the brush heads are so small, but I am even more unhappy that I wind up with one or more bristles left in my mouth after almost every brushing.  I have only been using the product a little over a month, and there has been no color change in the bristles, so it isn't that the brush head is worn out.  The tiny size of the brush head makes it feel like I need to spend longer brushing my teeth than should be necessary.<br />August 3, 2012  I contacted Phillips, and they are going to send me another box of brush heads.  I did discover that the blue color had completely faded on both brushes I had used in less than a month each.
B001TKJ30I|5|When sweat is running, other items hurt eyes, but this item doesn’t and it's reputation. I like this when I exercise.
B004CG0RLK|5|I wanted a product to loosen my hair, not straighten it completely. My hairdresser tried several others, but they didn't give me the look or feel that I was looking for. My cousin in Texas recommended the Affirm Fiberguard, and it was perfect! I ordered the 9-application pack, and used two of them the first time. This pack is a great deal, as you get all the other items you need. If you want your hair completely relaxed, you can just leave it on the fully recommended time. LOVE THIS PRODUCT!!
B0076OHQIM|2|not a good product..does not address wrinkles as promised.
B000I1S18Y|5|this multi-cut clipper and trimmer set is great for when your on the go and need a hair trim or cut great for traveling without the visit to the barber
B00D2JAKY2|5|These donut buns are amazing, and taking into account they are shipping from China arrived rather quickly.  I used the large one on my dd's hair first, next I'll try the medium, I don't think I'll use the small one, but it is an amazing deal for a product that works.  Still using 2 years later, so they do hold up well!  Getting ready to order some more, just because they magically disappear
B008H4R8EC|5|Had bought this product from Publishers Clearing House (PCH) and when it came time to buy more I had a terrible time finding it.  I'm so glad I finally thought to look here on Amazon!<br /><br />My hair was beginning to get thin, due to some of the medicine I have to take [I am sure getting close to 60 years old has nothing to do with it!  ;-) ]  and having always had thick hair it was very hard on my ego.  I bought this shampoo from PCH on a whim and found I loved it.  I am not sure it helped with the growth, but I do know it made my hair thicker.  I began to get new growth and found I had a lot fewer split ends. Fewer split ends means less breakage ... so I suppose faster growth.<br /><br />In one of the reviews someone commented on this shampoo being thin or watery.  I found I had to be careful when pouring it into my hand.  A little bit does wonders!
B004C6QP3Y|5|You can not beat their price and the brushes are excellent.
B00HX6TSZW|1|This chair is very low quality! I ordered two of them and both arm rest pieces fell off. They are very low to the ground and hard to pump up.
B0036LMGZW|5|I love the aroma of this body cream. It's consistency is not like a whipped or soft cream so at first I didn't know if I would like it. I like it's moisturizing affects and feel it's composition helps prevent moisture loss from my skin.   I am now using my 3rd jar. I still LOVE it and will keep buying it. I put it on my feet, arms and hands every night. I love falling to sleep in a cloud of Lavender.
B00B22BCJS|5|just love olay
B004367X70|5|It was just what I expected!!! Great for bad hair days!!!! You can turn a ponytail into a  really cute style!
B001MP2P3C|4|I don't have much experience with nail stripers, so it didn't feel right to give this 5 stars, but I love this striper.  It is rich in glitter unlike most glitter nail polishes, and easy to control.  A word of warning: it is difficult to remove.
B00155Z6V2|5|There's not a whole lot to say about it, really - it's just great.  Smooth, clearly organic, and a lot of it.  Great buy.
B003YEGI0A|5|This tool is wonderful for ears and also a great too for blackhead removal. The tweezers are useless but I never found their purpose anyway.
B001ET7D9W|5|The only deodorant I have found that totally works.  You can go running and it still works.
B0064FJXDU|3|Good
B00R2L69EG|1|I received this toothpaste as a promotion and have to say that I couldn't even use it long enough to find out if it whitened my teeth. I suppose for people who regularly use whitening products, it is probably easier and faster than whitening strips or other treatments that are available. However, I thought it was a pain. The first step is a pop top tube that you brush with like normal, but you don't rinse. Then the second tube, is a screw top which is a pain in the butt. My toothbrush was already wet and I didn't want to have to set it down to open the second tube. Then you brush with it and rinse like normal. I felt like it didn't leave my teeth feeling very clean - I wanted to use my regular toothpaste after using this one to get that clean minty feeling. It felt weird to not rinse after the first step which is what attributed to the gritty feeling on my teeth. But, like I said, it's probably a better option for people who regularly whiten.
B000SRTO6Q|5|Very good, sharp precise cutting tool. Love it.
B00CK8BPMC|4|I ordered this same product again and received a better composed product with smoother application in a clear acrylic rectangle package with brush.
B002Q8IHXQ|5|This product makes my skin feel so smooth and clean.  I am glad that my sister told me about this product.  Amazon shipped it pretty fast and I didn't have to wait long between ordering and delivery.
B00009RF1E|4|Noisy, but good overall.
B000GGJC98|5|These are great for fresh breath on the go. Pop one in after that cup of coffee or puff if cigarett or just to fell fresh before an intimate moment. These are the best things ever made for a mouth full of refreshment.
B00KPX9IVE|3|Has a nice smell too. The sifter fell out of the packaging,  and is not the best product for dry skin. Other that that,  I really like it!
B00G5WO2VK|5|Ive been using the Argan oil to tame my frizzy hair and I am really impressed with the result. I love how the product is all natural and 100% organic. I don't have to use a lot and it goes a long way. I massage 3 to 4 drops into my hair from roots to ends after washing 3 times a week. The dropper cap makes it so easy to dispense the amount I need to use. My hair looks and feels so much softer and healthier now.
B002FCH4B4|4|Still the best and definitely affordable like this. Tip for any who want more bubbles and the spout isn't doing it for you.<br /><br />Get a power wisk and run it in the tub for a minute while filling the tub. Lots more bubbles and they will last longer.
B006MRM2TW|3|It was okay, not very fancy but it does the job. I was just expecting more pizzazz I guess.
B008YQM46K|3|My teeth got super white and pretty, but unfortunately now I have a piece of gum that has worn away from my entire tooth. Will make sure to be careful with my sensitive mouth.
B00GKHG6DC|4|Great cereal, but the price has escalated to the point where it's no longer affordable.
B003YJAZZ4|4|Great shaving experience, close smooth shave, fast and no skin irritation. Self cleaning is painless. Only downside no side-burn  cutter.
B00GRJLCBE|4|Very nice  two tone head band. Great fit and very stylish.<br />Just wish I had a bigger color selection.
B000GHWSYS|5|The scent is fresh, delicious easily my favorite on her. Not teeny cooper sweet nor old like Channel #5. This is a nice fragrance
B00MVABJJI|5|Once again,  I am very impressed with the quality, sharpness and price of these clippers. Having purchased the cuticle clippers, I wanted to see if these were just as good, and Yes! They are! They are wonderful! Very sharp, durable and easy to store/carry.
B00GJUR8GE|5|I have been using this wonderful product for a while now, it has made such a noticeable improvement to my neck and décolleté, the lines seem less pronounced and my skin is lovely and soft, far better results then more expensive products I have used in the past. I shall stay with this product and I shall also try other products from this range. Try this product ladies you will not be disappointed.
B002VTT55E|3|Material is very thin. Taco looks better in the photo than in real life. However, it's the best fit for my bully sunglasses  so it has turned out to be useful.
B00IRYBN02|5|Really loving this ponytail wig, easy to wear n handle, hair texture is very good, first time I have ordered ponytail wig, just I am completely satisfied with this.
B00D8G4FJU|5|No need for additional blades like other razors have.  These have all the blades that are needed - at an unbeatable price.
B00B57QRSQ|5|I would reccomend this product to anyone out there looking for a less expensive badger hair brush. Don't pass this one up
B006W2SYHG|5|use it with shaving cream as I did with my blade razor. shaves close and smooth<br /> this line is just to make up the stupid minimum words thing
B0050HO9MI|4|Well, the first round of razors was a bummer. My 3 never came from the seller &#34;Beautiful life&#34; but I did get a prompt refund. My moms arrived from &#34;Beautiful life&#34; with a tian fu rusty blade and was marked Junjie at the top. The bottom blade guards were bent and I have not shaved with it. The handle does not thread smoothly onto the head and the head vs handle is at a slight angle. I bent the guards back a bit with some cloth (the bottom plate's edges are much sharper than the rimei below) and I think the razor will still shave.<br /><br />The concern is that just getting a &#34;sodial&#34; or &#34;silver tone&#34; razor on amazon may result in you getting a junjie. No thanks.<br /><br />I reordered more from THIS link (via the currently absent seller &#34;Panda Town&#34;) instead: http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00A7239EK/ref=oh_details_o01_s00_i00?ie=UTF8&psc=1<br /><br />As far as I can see, all the hong kong sellers sell the good RIMEI ones.<br /><br />The 3 new &#34;RiMei&#34; razors I received are much, much better quality. They came in a red/white packaging with the RiMei brand and they rock. The major difference between the two besides for the quality is that the RiMei ones have two nubs/bumps attached to the top plate that stick out of the bottom plate. I put a little bit of lithium grease on the handle's threads and now it's pretty damn smooth. Everything about this razor feels higher quality than the crap junjie above even though they look pretty similar.<br /><br />If I can track down more $2 RiMei razors, i'll be buying more as gifts. By the time someone wears one of these out s/he will know whether DE shaving is something they will generally want to pursue or not.
B002RXW5BA|4|I ordered this product for my friend for Christmas.When it arrived at my house it was about 2 or 3 days late..but Christmas season can be a little insane.Anyways this product has bright vibrant colors,and none of the color pallets were broken which is a plus! (: I think my friend will love her gift.The only complaint I have about this product is that the color pans are SO much smaller than they appear to be in the picture.About the size of a dime.
B00H6TAF9E|5|This product lately has been hard to find.  Our is the most perfect hair smoother.  I am 45 and my hair had changed over time.  It smooths coarse hair.  Love it!  I hope they continue to make this product!
B000GF5UFE|5|This product does not irritate my daughter's eyes or her sensitive skin.  It foams well (but not overly so) and it rinses clean easily.  It's lovely on her full head of hair, too.  I've used it since birth and now use all of their products.  Light scent - just enough to smell cuddly clean.
B0013FS4XQ|5|THE VERY BEST!!!! i loooove opi and all their product.. put it on.. 1 minute and you can touch it. give it 5 minutes and your nails are completely dry!! love love love love!!!
B008CZBZQI|4|great smell
B006L2137A|5|Have really sensitive skin, cystic acne prone- skin just a mess. I bought this after my sister claimed to have good results.<br />This is the first cleanser that left my face clean yet not dried out. I'm a product junkie who has been in search of the acne cure, this isn't a cure but in conjunction with a few other products my face looks better than it has in years. I'm 40, fair-medium complexion and some scarring oily during summer.<br />While using this along with cetaphil eczema calming moisturizer at night and cetaphil oil control SPF 30 during the day I can smile and not hide behind my hair. My box came with a mfg coupon for $3.00 off next cetaphil purchase so that was a plus!!
B00BTKVRXO|5|This is a wonderful, light fragrance that has some nice &#34;allure.&#34;  Would that it would have a bit more staying power,<br />but then, nothing is perfect!  I love it! And the little roll on bottle makes it a great travel companion.
B00MRU0VGY|5|Just the best.
B00538T816|5|I love this one it smell so good.
B000US2564|5|Really impressed! Love love love!
B00AY2VAM6|3|I enjoyed this soap. It has a very light citrus scent to it. Doesn't dry out your skin at all. My only complaint is this bar is VERY soft and  does not last more than two to three weeks with daily use. But for the price it's not to bad. I find the Jack Black turbo bar a much better soap for the price.
B0000C1I9D|2|Too oily didn't seem to do anything to help wrinkles. I like the roc product better I see results with it. This product was a waste
B006WZA1GK|5|this stuff is amazing. after wearing mac for years and having skin issues, i finally gave it up and decided to :gasp: try a drug store foundation. i'm in love. it's not thick, it has spf and it makes my skin GLOW. love love love.the fact that it comes with this great little foundation brush is a great bonus.
B00ILKDQPW|1|Terrible .. I bought two of them and both broke as soon as I wore it
B00596VEP0|4|Can't complain it's shave cream,  it works.  Also has medication to help with pimples.
B000VSDA4E|5|Excellent
B005WBOD0K|5|THE BEST ROSE SOAP I HAVE FOUND. GREAT SCENT LONG LASTING AND ALL ROUND GOOD QUALITY
B00VVZL33G|5|I absolutely  loved  it .  Will purchase  it again in the future .
B00AB5OEUQ|5|i like it,but i like makari carotene better,i though it was the one i was choosing.
B000CNOBKU|1|FAKE AND CHEAP SMELLING
B004G1CLTM|4|Excellent product but be aware that this contains the same solution used with professional spray tanning equipment. It is very thin and needs to be applied evenly. I would not recommend spraying it on but applying with a mitt. In addition, you need to rinse after about 3-4 hours and rinse your hands after 1-2 hours. Otherwise, it could get way too dark. Best use is for someone that wants to tan rapidly for a last-minute event, or if you hate waiting for 12 hours to shower (me). One final note: After rinsing (do not use regular soap during first rinse) you will continue to darken for the next 8-10 hours.
B00CO8YGCY|4|I enjoy exploring fragrances, even though it has become less welcome in some public areas.<br /><br />This is s nice, light mens' eau de cologne that has been sold in Russia for some years.<br /><br />I was a bit surprised at the slick packaging.  Most products from Russia (and certainly the old USSR) were modestly packed, with no silver printing an frequently recycled materials.<br /><br />Another item, bought at the same time, says Vikon, Paris.  And (to be blunt) the bottles and slick cardboard look a lot like the packaging I've seen on knock-offs (&#34;our version of...&#34;) sold in drug stores and even dollar stores!<br /><br />So, while I am open to being wrong about this, I wonder if these products are made elsewhere and then sold in the Russian market and also make their way here? I do not see any &#34;Made in Russia&#34; anywhere on the boxes.
B008K8CMX2|3|This shampoo was just ok. I was hoping for the price my hair would have looked nicer after using it. I have used other Fekkai products and loved them, I guess this one is just not for me.
B007FZR99I|2|I can't tell it really works.  Jojoba oil seems better
B00PUMEREI|5|I love this oil. It dispenses well. Doesn't leave a greasy feeling and soaks right in for all day protection!
B006U98T08|4|I jut received the brushes a few days ago, they are great. They're not perfect though. It is true that there is a slight smell, almost like a spray paint smell, but the smell is only on the pink bag that comes with the brushes. Also the brushes do shed a little but only while you first wash them and pull at them. Otherwise it shouldn't be an issue. All the brushes are soft and the handles are sturdy. One thing I did not like is that a few jars on the brushes are stray and not perfectly straight, this will not affect make-up application but can be less appealing to the eye. All in all I would purchase these brushes again you get what you pay for and these are a great deal! ALSO HEADS UP DO NOT PURCHASE THESE BRUSHES FOR MORE THAN $16 INCLUDING SHIPPING AND HANDLING ANY PRICES ABOVE THIS ARE NOT WORTH IT! I PAYED ABOUT $15.68 FOR THESE w/S&H. I SAY THIS BECAUSE I SAW THESE PRICED FOR 49.99 without S&H DON'T BUY IT, WAIT!!
B00CMTV9SE|1|Worked well but after the forth session it doesn't work any more. Wife was disapointed this one had a strong vibration.
B000NIZZYK|5|Great little spatula for getting the last little bit of cosmetic product out of the bottle!  Great seller ... will be purchasing again.
B00A0IWRU8|5|I read a review about best shampoos for a good price.  I  would never have purchased Suave  in the past, I was a  shampoo snob!  I  decided to take a chance and bought small bottles at a  discount store. I was so surprised, I  logged on to Amazon right away and bought the shampoo and conditioner right away.  Amazon's  prices were less than the small bottles I bought at the store too! I'll never  be a shampoo snob again.
B005KX4PAS|1|I wanted the older version of this item , the new one I could have bought at the dollar store for a dollar , which is why I was looking forward to purchasing the old version show in  your image, also the applicator was missing.
B0012UEJ1S|2|i couldn't tell a difference after using this product. the only positive thing i can say is that it didn't color my hands or shower curtain like the brow glaze did.
B006DHFBJO|4|This product smells nice and it works.  It shines the face from the first few times of wearing it. No side effects. Nice packaging. I wish these russian products on amazon have more description in English language.
B004GT0CFY|3|I can't argue that it works, but be careful that it doesn't stain your clothes.  I would recommend wearing this for the day and then showering really well before putting on nice clothes.
B00F84AVPW|5|I've had this closure installed for about 3 weeks now...and it is still just as soft and silky as it was when I initially removed it from the packaging. The closure looks great and I recieve compliments daily. Because I am so pleased with the closure, I have decided to order four bundles of peruvian hair for my next install. I will do a review on this as well. I'm hoping to love the bundles just as much as I love this closure! Thanks Eayon!
B004VUCBMA|2|Keeps changing colors...green when washed...kinda brown next and then kinda purplish brown next day. Not sure when it will be black. Tried 2 times but no black.
B0058E3XJI|5|Great buy!! So much cheaper here than in the salon. I usually hate these lotions because of the over powering smell- but not this one. Covers and moisturizers well and I could tell a difference in my tan with just one session.
B006J44ICC|5|I just got this today and i love this little jars they are small and i was able to perfectly fit my cute little bows in them. The top lid from the case did came broke but i dont mind i fixed it . So will order again when i need more . Thankz..!
B00GXFZHD6|5|Thank you
B002IB4KGE|4|This is a good eye brightener, goes on smooth, I like it, price is ok.  I probably will not purchase again though.
B00LKQ4FWM|5|Finally an all in one eyebrow tool. Easy to use and long lasting.
B006ZBP8NM|5|This product is very very powerful. You really need to be cautious about putting it on straight to your skin. I did that the first time and my skin had a very strong reaction to it - red and very inflamed. The next day my skin started to peel and 3 days after that I had the clearest, pore free skin I've ever had. I use it weekly and find that it works best if I cut it with some carrier oil - leave it on for 3-5 minutes and then wipe off. It really has made my fine lines disappear. I'd recommend  it - but do a patch test first !
B00859DRRG|4|Good product. I love mine and bought this one for my mother in law, it leaks :( she said her purse is very aromatic now! I think it's still a good product, just a bum individual one.
B004HJ6TAA|3|I bought this 3 weeks ago and am still trying it out. I have thick, dark, coarse hair on my pasty white legs. I have to shave everyday. Basically, I get a 5 o'clock shadow on my legs. It stinks. I have gone to waxing, but that only lasts about 2-3 weeks before regrowth. So I thought  I would try this as it seems promising.<br /><br />I have only had it for three weeks so far, so my rating will change as I continue to use it.  I have been using this 3 times a week since I got it and I have also been using the lotion after each use.<br /><br />Week One: No real reduction in hair growth.  Couldn't tell the difference between this and shaving.<br /><br />Week two: Have pricklies.  Not silky smooth results, but this is only the second week of use and the directions say to wait four weeks before noticeable results. Basically, I have constant stubble on my legs.<br /><br />Week Three:  The growth seems to have slowed, but I still have constant stubble on my legs.  I cannot tell if I am getting any results from treatment. I still need to shave if I want to go out in a skirt.<br /><br />The hair on my arms was finer when I began and it has been reduced after 3 weeks of using it 3 times a week.  The hair on my upper lip has also bee reduced. My chin however is no change. Partly because it is so bony that I can't get the no no to work there.<br /><br />I will keep this updated as I go. Hope I start getting some real results soon.  If by week six I have nothing better to show other than constant stubble, I will send this back for a refund. Though it has reduced the hair on my arms so I may keep it for that, but until then. Like I said, I am only on week 3 and have 3 more to go until their promised results are supposed to be evident.<br /><br />Week 4:  Still have constant stubble on the legs.  Not looking too promising that I will get the silky smooth results. I have noticed some complaining about this burning their skin. I have not had that. It does feel warm, but it doesn't burn. The hair on my arms has lessened and the hair on my upper lip is not as noticeable.<br /><br />Week 5: Sorry if I'm a bit late for this.  No real improvement from the constant stubble on my legs and underarms.  The hair is not getting finer or any less noticeable.<br /><br />Week 6:  Same as week 5.  Though it has dramatically reduced the amount of hair on my arms and my upper lip; my legs still look hairy.  Basically, the most I have gotten is constant stubble on my legs which means I still need to shave in order to weak shorts. I have another week to go before I can call for a refund.  At this point I am not sure if I want to return it or not.  But considering I paid about $265 for this and am not getting the results I thought I'd get, I will probably return it for a refund.<br /><br />I will leave this at 3 stars because though it did not get rid of the hair on my legs, it did reduce it on my arms and lip.
B004KXLIVS|3|It's great mascara. It separates and makes my lashes look more voluminous. However, I have drugstore brands that do that EXACT same thing. I though that investing in this mascara would be worth it, but I don't think I'll repurchase after this one is empty. I prefer Clinique, Benefit They're Real, or just Maybelline.<br /><br />Didn't meet my $23 expectations.
B002AOG9SG|5|Bioelements SPF 50 Broad Spectrum Face Screen is possibly the best combination moisturizer and sun protection out there.  The company makes many excellent skin products.  The Face Screen is a good value.  It lasts a long time.  The cream is light and very easy to apply, under make-up, or even with no make-up.  The cream is not greasy, nor does your face have a shine.  Put it on in the morning and you are ready to go, knowing your delicate face is protected from the elements and is also being nourished.  This product really does deserve five stars - and more.  And you should be using sun screen every day, all year round.  Why not make it super pleasant and easy?
B00A0S7NMA|5|really good
B006GQYSGE|4|I have owned a Norelco before but went to blades years ago.  I wanted this product to supplement a razor shave on days when a close shave is not real critical.  It works well for a cordless but it will never shave as close as a blade.  It's great for days when I just want a quick shave and closeness is not a big deal.
B007MNYY14|3|I always wanted to be a &#34;Wen Girl&#34; but wanted to try this one after reading the reviews. I do not like the smell and my hair seems to get dirty the morning after I wash it. I had to use approx 20 to 25 pumps each time I shampooed.<br /><br />Cons:<br />One bottle wont last me more then 10 uses before Ill have to buy again.<br />The smell is terrible.<br />My hair feels greasy and cant go more then 2 days without washing it again.<br />My hair felt almost sticky and not anymore softer then if I used a cheap .99 cent bottle of V05.<br /><br />Pros:<br />My thin hair felt thicker.<br />not as much breakage.<br /><br />Ive been using Fekkai for about a year and really love it but I heard great things about using conditioner shampoo so I thought I would stray away from Fekkai. I didnt really care for this brand so I went ahead and purchased Wen to see if it makes a difference. While I'm waiting for Wen to arrive, I switched back to Fekkai and WOW I really notice a difference. Welcome back my old friend!<br /><br />Ill give Wen a try but Im pretty sure it wont impress me more then Fekkai has over the last year.
B00FQ8OQZ6|1|Unfortunately, this product was not the requested product per their description.  It's a product that is used only for facial make-up applications.
B000C1UBFQ|5|Bvlgari Aqva is a favorite.  We were very glad to find it at such a good deal.  We received our purchase in a timely manner.  The packaging was sufficient.  We would definitely order again.
B0050OX4O0|5|This hair therapy wrap/cordless heating cap is awesome!  So easy and convenient if you need heat to condition or color your hair. FYI, if you're looking for something to fit over curlers, this is NOT the product for you. It's for &#34;hair therapy&#34; with heat. It &#34;wraps&#34; closely but comfortably around the head.
B00S7DP2PU|5|My grandson loves it
B001U5TO2E|1|My results are minimal for relief from spray because a majority fails to reach my actual eyes.  A propensity to defensively blink doesn't help.  The ounce doesn't last very long and occasional dripping from the nozzle increases the expense.
B00B99O5WK|5|I use mine several times a week and love it. Your skin should be wet or oiled. I used mine after I put on my coconut oil after the shower.
B00IKD3MX6|5|I am in love with this product! I have combination skin an try to stay away from oils but this oil is amazing, it soaks into my skin and has improved my skin appearance. This is my new moisturizing cream and night cream and the price is just right the amount of product.
B00FZESMKG|5|I've been using this product for a couple weeks now and I absolutely love it! It doesn't dry out my skin, it's non-irritating, and my skin looks and feels healthier! I will definitely buy this again!
B003RIQV6E|5|Love, love, love this stuff! The only thing that works to clear my skin.  I am 33 years old and have been breaking out for about 3 years.  I have tried many different skin care items and this brand is the only stuff that works!  I also use their cleanser! Thank you!
B0086VI9LW|5|Our 3½ year old son has been using a Sonicare with the standard small adult brush head for about a year. He got used to it quickly, but had some difficulty with keeping the hard plastic from contacting his teeth. If you're already a Sonicare user, you know what a &#34;shock&#34; this can transmit into your skull (my wife had the same complaint when we first got the Sonicare, and she because of that she stayed away from it for a long time).<br /><br />Although that small adult brush head was working well enough, when I found these for replacement, I figured they'd be worth a shot. I'll tell you what, this soft outer skin maybe ought to be standard on all of their brush heads.<br /><br />It's just a simple rubbery coating, but when it contacts the teeth, the instant zap of vibration just isn't there. The brush heads themselves look to be about the same size as the standard small adult brush heads, though the overall length of each attachment is perhaps a half inch shorter, making these just a bit easier to handle for small kids.<br /><br />We continue to use both Oral B and Sonicare in our house, but since we've switched our oldest to these heads, he reaches for the Sonicare every time.
B00KCFAZTE|2|Great company, but the product did not work for me.  However, I am 66 and maybe it needs a younger skin.
B004X1QKVU|4|very good coverage for every day wear. Worth the price.
B00BZ1QN2C|5|I'm rarely wowed by a beauty product, but I highly recommend this one. Some are saying it's just a scrub and not a mask, and given the consistency, I can see why, but to get the full effect you need to use it as a mask. The charcoal needs time to do it's thing. I put it on before I plan to shower. I recommend applying over a sink because it's easy to drop little chunks of the sugar, though once it's on it stays put. Bottle says to leave on 5-7 minutes, I do a minimum of 10, usually longer because I end up distracted reading the internet. Then once in the shower, I wet my hands and scrub for 2 minutes or so. I've noticed a great reduction in blackheads. My skin is softer and smoother. This doesn't dry you out. It has a nice but light scent, and I say this as someone highly sensitive to smell, it doesn't trigger my allergies or headaches at all. And really you can't beat the price.
B00LC94I8I|5|I had other safety razors before, but this one tops them all. I got this kit as a birthday present from my wife this year. The shave is so smooth that you will love it.
B0070P3FOQ|5|This skin bonding cement is perfect for ostomy care as the name suggests. The smell goes away quickly and is not powerful.  Very happy with the product.
B0048KSGZO|5|Works well to keep unruly brows in place. I apply before my pencil and it helps with setting it too.
B0046QCS0Y|3|Burns very well. I prefer a stronger scent.
B0028IX9S2|4|Is it a shimmer bronzer? I'd hate to order it and it has a shimmer to it hm hmmhm hm hm
B007RX3AFA|5|Gave this for a Christmas present and it was a big hit.  It's a great kit for someone who loves makeup.
B001CY87TE|5|These are really perfect for using with velcro rollers. They are not too large and not too small. they dont crimp your hair either.  I am really pleased with them.
B00C1ZUEW6|5|I put these clips at the front of plan teal colored pumps and they look like a million dollars! Can't wait to see the photographers photos! They are perfectly made and the gem is larger than it looks in the pic! It shines!
B003983I1S|4|I use these cartridges with my Gillette Fusion Proglide Power Styler, and the Power cartridges are a must!  The microcomb helps \\"guide\\" stubble to blades and leaves me with a much cleaner shave. Definitely recommended!<br /><br />I received these razor cartridges for free via a program run by Gillette.
B001GMANIA|5|Best eyeliner ever
B000ULREX0|5|This shampoo has saved my hair. I used it several years ago and thought it was great. Since then, I have had a baby (which changed my hair in weird ways) and had color added. My hair was a mess! After deciding to give this a try again (wavering only because of the price), I couldn't be happier.  My hair has been saved! I am not sure I will ever use anything else!  All I can do now is hope they don't stop making this!
B00KOW827M|4|I gave this a four not because of the brushes but because of the late shipping. It took a few days after the estimated date to receive them.<br />However, these brushes are amazing ! they are extremely soft and all in tact! Each individual brush was wrapped and were in great condition. Love it!
B0077I6KFC|5|It is just like the solution provided with my new shaver.  The price is very affordable and would recommend this to anyone.
B001P5HCKK|4|Would give it 5 stars but my old 3 series head gives a closer shave
B00BXPKRXQ|1|the hair looked nothing like the picture that was shown. it tangle so easily and the lace was so little. it was more a regular wig than a front lace.
B002DOO1VA|1|I purchased this set for my daughter as a Christmas present.  When she tried them out, they were very coarse and scratchy and the bristles on all the brushes she tried fell apart in clumps.  We were both very disappointed.  The description listed them as studio quality, but they aren't.  I am returning this product for a refund now.
B00EE5RECY|5|Good
B00NH9X0EO|5|Good product.
B00D3CV5AQ|5|I love how smooth this is! It is light and refreshing with a really simply scent! It works as a nice, light moisturizer before any other skin products! I've already ordered it again!
B002BGT7DM|5|Love the scent! Excellent hair product!
B00IUF1P4C|3|They Really Didn't Fit Me And When I Tried Them On They Pinched My Ear And Turn Them Red But They Are Cute But For Someone With Little Earlobes.... But For The Price I Feel I Didn't Waste Money Cause I Can Give Them As A Gift To Someone With Small Lobes Hahah
B00ICU3E5S|5|I love all of the Perlier scents in this set. These hand creams work great.
B00A6VN56E|5|favorite product and more cheaper that in stores
B00G9MV6TM|5|Love it
B00WX252BK|5|I was in need of a great exfoliating scrubber and this one is perfect!  Like most of us, my arms just aren't long enough to get all areas of my back, and I'm just not as flexible as I used to be. I found this exfoliating scrubber belt to be the perfect length. It is approximately 4&#34; wide and 29&#34; long, not including the handles.  I am able to hold both handles comfortably and scrub my back without worry of missing the middle of my back. The scrubber is soft, with a soft rope-like material in the center that is great for exfoliating skin.  It has 12&#34; opening that is big enough to place a bar of soap in if you choose to do so. The handles are flexible and easy to grip. I have used the exfoliating belt every day since receiving it. It leaves my skin feeling fresh, clean, and soft. After use, I simply rinse it well, wring out excess water, and hang to dry. It's ready for use the next day, feeling just as soft as the day before. I received this product at a discount in exchange for my honest review. The Premium Exfoliating Sisal Belt Scrubber is a quality product. It comes with bonus face/body scrubber that I use to exfoliate my upper arms.  It fits in my hand and is just the right size for scrubbing my elbows and upper arms. If you're looking for a great exfoliating experience, this is the product for you!
B00M4Q8XMK|5|This soap is hard to find in the stores around where I live.  This is a wonderful soap.
B004QNIC1G|5|Best product ever my aunt burned her back on a heating pad.  We used the oil 3-4 times a day it healed slowly but as bad as it was she never got an infection and she has no signs of scaring great stuff
B000WMYFQ6|5|I bought this for my wedding, i was a bit ifffy but after a couple days trying to decide between this one and 2 more i decided to go with this one. It looks a little bigger in the pic than the original size. It looks more expensive that what i paid for it.<br />I also received this product a few days before the edd and thats a plus for me. I would buy from this seller again.<br />Its simply Beautiful... It goes well with my wedding dress...Just Perfect!!!
B000LNWUIG|2|This doesn't go on very well.  I have tried wet, damp, slightly damp and dry.  Each time, there is a hard cover on my hair that I have to clear before I can style my hair.  I like most of the Free & Clear products and they do keep my hair and scalp in good condition.  However, this was not easy to use and presents too many problems.
B00AN4OI0G|1|Wow, Horrible and hard as hell! It hurt so bad to put it on my eye lids! Definitely 100% disappointed
B009Q1YPTG|1|Three times I bought this product but I received always damage . I like this item but enough I dont buying again
B000V3MIF6|5|This is good hair loss treatment. I use it with Ducray Anaphase shampoo. And it works. I repeat it every other year.
B0056JVQ8A|4|It's very small. I tried it out dry on my foot around my toes. I could see the dirt being scrapped off and it doesn't hurt at all. My foot is smoother now and I can't wait to use it more and more.
B00CLRHKJY|3|They arrived very fast. I didn't have any problem with the seller. They were great... until a skull fell off while I was out. I didn't notice until I got home so I have no clue where it might have gone.
B00NII2AQS|5|I actually recieved  these today and I used one once I got home from work. I must say I am absolutely in love with this product! It took all my makeup off with out feeling like I just ripped my face off! I always have difficulty getting my eye liner nd mascara completely off with out looking like I have black eyes from it smearing all over but, I am proud to say this product put an end to that!!!! ðŸ˜Š I am so glad I gave this product a try cause now I'm a happy customer who will continue to buy! It's deffiently worth a try ladies you won't be disappointed!
B00A3LVMMQ|5|Great stand.  Solid construction.  Tall enough to hold my brush and safety razor.  Slim enough to not take up a lot of counter top real estate.
B003P904EA|1|i got an empty bottle of the envyderm, it has literally nothing inside the bottle, i cant believe it i just paid almost $44 for this item which is empty. it is very dissapointing
B000YA8A12|5|Love the color a gorgeous coral that stays shiny and goes on smooth
B00IK4SGVS|5|Love it!! I went from brunette to bright blonde in an hour!!
B0062PCGUE|5|I'm loving it!
B00E68O4JU|3|Works good only on really long hair.
B007RYVFC4|1|Not a fan at all.  This product is way too runny and makes me feel wet off the bat!  It lacks in scent and antiperspirant properties.  The packaging is too narrow not rigid enough.  If you put any pressure on it or knock it over the product spills out easily.  Sticking with old spice.
B003ITMPI0|5|It doesn't look like it holds much, but it DOES hold FULL SIZED bottles of cosmetic items EASILY.  It is a great compact case.  Rolls tight and is NOT BULKY.  I've had lots of other types of travel cases but this one is the BEST. Love that the individual cases inside come off with the velcro.  Will be ordering another just to store extra cosmetic items in the bathroom.
B00CDF6V44|2|I am a little disappointed with these cream glitters. I thought the application would be easier but its not. Most of the glitter is left on the brush or my finger and it does not go on smoothly with what little does get on my eyes. I would not purchase this ever again and feel like I wasted my money a little bit.
B001GBFEGM|3|YOU SENT ME THE WRONG BOTTLE I ORDERED THE ORIGINAL IN A BLACK BOTTLE BUT YOU SENT ME LOTION IN A WHITE BOTTLE. I DID NOT SEND IT BACK BECAUSE I WAS OUT OF IT AND COULD NOT FIND IT HERE. I WOULD HAVE  RATED IT 5 STAR BECAUSE I HAVE USED IT FOR YEARS,
B00NOAKUBM|1|Stopped working after 5 days, sent back for a full refund. I wanted to like this unit and indeed it was excellent while it worked, but any item that will not turn on after 5 days is a red flag for me. Will not be ordering another one.
B004BHA6MA|5|This goes on smooth and not sticky. Gives lips a shine while moistening them. Can be used alone or over lipstick.
B000XU9UJE|3|I like it.
B00DPE9EQO|4|I bought this by accident.. thought I was buying CE Ferulic..<br />Did not want to return it so I tried it.<br />I do like this.. not oily.. absorbs well..<br />I do like this ..I just really  like this my &#34;other Fav&#34;
B00141XHU4|3|The shipping was fine. However, the product was not good! Bizarre, as I like Fekkai products. Maybe just not a good match. Made my long, straight fine hair feel coated, dirty and sticky.
B00HSE4WJG|5|Worth every penny.
B00I80XBMS|5|They work great, even used one for the cat.
B00G5WYD6Y|5|Wonderful product, highly recommended.
B001LFFA9E|5|Product works great and I love that the cover just lifts off. The only thing that would have made it more perfect is if it had remained the same rectangle shape as the older style. This new one takes up more space and I cannot see a good reason why the shape was changed.<br /><br />Product arrived on time.
B000P20RQU|5|Amazing, beautiful, wonderful, lovely, elegant, elegant, just imagine every word that describes something lovely and this perfume is it!!  Best perfume in the world!!
B0011NKQJK|5|This shampoo and conditioner came quickly and in good condition.  I have been using Joico K-Pak for over a year, and my hair is noticeably healthier.  I had previously purchased the 1 liter bottles, but they lasted a very long time, so I decided to go with the smaller set this time.  The bottles are smaller than I expected, as 10.1 oz really is not a lot.  However, it should last me a few months, which is just what I wanted.
B00150DC04|4|This replaces MD Forte which I have used for 15 years so I'm not jumping up and down. I have no idea why they stopped making my FAVORITE product. But ok I give this is a fine replacement , no rash, good on wrinkles. Thats the idea ???
B001FB5HJC|5|This Mitchum deodorant is the only one I have found that doesn't irritate my skin. Most &#34;fragrance free&#34; brands have some sort of added scent that I react to, not this one. Cant find it in stores, even Drugstore.com stopped carrying it for some reason. Happy to find it on Amazon.
B000OIFDW8|5|Unfortunately, they do not make this product any more and it's very hard to find. I pay quite a bit for it now and it's a shame...for us AND Clinique. I have used other products from Clinique since they do not sell this in the stores, but NONE compare to the Workout Makeup...none...
B000G17862|3|I got this as a present to replace one of my battery-operated foil shavers which had to retire for the same reason I'm gonna retire this expensive 8975 (aka 550) - razor burns. This shaver gives a pretty close shave, but at what cost? It rips my skin to pieces - my skin got red in a matter of seconds.   ATT'N: for people reading this review - I'm not claiming it's a bad shaver, I have to admit that I know someone who uses it and is very happy with it, it just doesn't suit my type of skin.   So, first star for the close shave, second star for the battery time, second week and I still haven't charged it. And the final star for nifty hard-shell case with the brush :)  Two missing stars for: one ripping my face to pieces second week in a row and one for hard-shell case not being able to hold a cord (what's the point of a dual-voltage shaver, if one has to stick the cord somewhere (not with the shaver)?)   P.S. Bottom line - not recommended to anyone even with a slight case of sensitive skin. :)
B009HULDYG|5|These were exactly what I was looking for and there were plenty of them to do my thick long hair!
B00IKU004S|5|if you have denture,s.this is a great product to have.love it.
B002PBEDFK|4|This is a good shampoo that I only use when I take down my braids. When not in braids I use rhassoul clay and ACV.
B00AEBYP0G|5|Works great. Just advertised. Saw results in 1 week.
B000MASTM4|4|I really love how this stuff smells! It feels very refreshing on my skin and gives it a pretty glow!
B0000536P4|5|ok
B0011706EG|5|I am very pleased with my Upper Canada Soap & Lotion set. The scent is very light and the soap doesn't dry your skin. The lotion is very rich.
B009AZOM8M|3|Starts off not too bad....although you would have to keep it air tight in an container or soap dish after each use to keep ingredients fresh....would like to purchase a higher dosage amount, as a soap  form  like this, of main ingredient.
B002KPRS2G|3|I was very happy to receive this item considering the change of delivery date - earlier than the original date when I placed the order. I am very much pleased with my order because the brush came as described in the advertisement except for the word \\"Conair\\" that goes before Nexxus, is no where to be found...Also,  it did not come with an original Conair packaging. The description that says it is manufactured and distributed can be found inside the packing card label. The advertisement that says, \\"3 count\\" is misleading because I had the understanding that this item comes in 3 brushes, but it did not. I have no clue what this \\"3 count\\" at the end of the product name means. I haven't used it yet because I'm not sure if I'm gonna like it.
B004TSFBNK|5|Great brushes of good quality (especially for the price).<br /><br />I love the bigger brush and use it to buff in my foundation. It leaves a flawless & streak-free layer.<br /><br />The only brush I have yet to get major use out of is the flat concealer brush, but not because it is bad brush but because I simply have no use for it. Also, the stand thing is totally useless (IMHO).<br /><br />Recommend and will be buying more when I'm stateside.
B002T71IL2|4|But I think that's more about my lash turnover than the product.  Hard to say.  It definitely worked for me and did last a good 2 weeks though swimming in a chlorinated pool.  Did not cause any sort of adverse reaction.
B00HVSPTA0|5|great brushes!
B007AWXT7M|4|If you have brassy hair or hair that pulls red or yellow tones while bleaching? THIS STUFF REALLY WORKS!!!<br />A Hairstylist recommended it to me.<br />3 drops/3oz of bleach mix to nix yellow tones.<br />***DISCLAIMER***<br />IF your hair is already pre-lightened to a very white blonde? You DO run the risk of a blue-ish tinge...although I have personally never encountered this problem.<br />I have mixed this with bleach, shampoo & conditioner. ALL items designed to help keep blonde hair BLONDE.<br />I have naturally strawberry blonde hair that I keep WHITE blonde & this product helps a great deal.<br />I also lighten at home, using L'Oreal Quick Blue Bleach Powder.<br />I dislike the idea of someone else being in control of my hair.<br />I have never gotten bad results - except for ONE time.<br />IT DOES NOT MIX WELL WITH HARD WATER **TREATED WITH SOFTENERS***, if you have well water? I suggest rinsing your roots with gallon jugs of spring water...legit.
B001G5FOLI|5|I have a very coarse beard and I have found that I get the smoothest shave from these razors.  I have to be very careful about my 1st shave with these as to not press the razor at all to my skin but I shouldn't have to any way.  But after trying the huge variety pack last year ,the Feather blades are my favorite.  I need to save money and go for the larger pack next time though.
B000PXYADK|5|The Revlon curling iron brush was perfect while traveling Italy! I highly recommend it for international travel.  I also use it at home.
B00C2SD2SA|5|I am very pleased to say Nisim Fast really works. My hair DOES NOT typically grow fast. I purshased this product, had my hair measured and began to wash and condition daily as directed. Most African-Americans don't shampoo daily, but I'm natural and had the big chop almost 1 year ago with slow growth. Honestly after 2 weeks I had my hair measured again and there IS growth, YEAH; This is not normal for me. I shared my shampoo and condition with my mother and niece. Each of us has since purchased our personal set.<br /><br />The CON I have about using this product is the fact it DOES dry out our hair; so to combat that you MUST use a good moisturizer.
B008B7QY0E|4|It really nice
B00KVOR9VI|3|After having a wonderful loofah for many years, I decided to get another one.  I couldn't find one similar to the one that I had so I ordered this one.  It is ok but very thin and I don't feel like I'm getting a good exfoliation out of it. However, I will use until I find another one similar to the one I used to have.
B005064FA0|3|It holds a lot of cosmetics, which I do appreciate. But the center is NOT a good brush holder. It's too tall for standard size brushes. They get stuck. So I like it enough, but think the design should get a reboot.
B007ZXYR3G|5|The best eyeliner howevervtoo expensive.
B00ABMZIO0|5|When I had breast cancer Origins gave our Cancer Group their products and I was pleased.  When Amazon had Origins other products I decided I must try them as well.  When my skin is at its driest during the winter months I need extra moisture, these products are it.
B00847TAUC|5|I got this as a free sample, and I am back to buy more!  It does pale your lipstick a little, but this \\"nearly clear\\" lip primer smells like coconut and makes my favorite lipstick last 6 hours instead of the normal 1-2 hours!
B005JV1YRI|3|It probably would have been wonderful -- the first few days it felt good on my skin, but being an oil in a small glass vial, on day 4 it slipped from my hands and broke all over the floor.  I was very sad.  I can't say this is a Queen Bee problem, just not user friendly for me personally.
B004SFTBRG|5|This blood pressure monitor has everything I wanted, memory, internet, ac/dc power, and the price was right. What more could you ask.
B003DX7G4E|5|I love IMAN products. She has captured the thing that I, as a woman love. Revert since I have been wearing this makeup I have been getting compliments from all over. Radiant skin is marvelous.
B00OLBEX4S|5|WOW ALL I CAN SAY .... YOU HAVE GAVE ME BACK MY TRIBE ..... The scent is so strong it lasts all day long ....<br />I will be placing another order very soon ...<br />Tisha from Franklinton,La
B006RMU910|5|Received purchase fast and just as described ~ THANK YOU!!!! :)
