B001BKAEHW|5.0|A+  Lets see... uhhmmm - Like buying Clapton's, or Hendrix's very first record, and, saying you were into it when it all started.    This guy is super talented; writes his own music, plays the meanest blues guitar around and can pull off the crooner we all love to.. well, love.  Chics dig his music and his look, and they will likely NOT mind if you're also playing it in your car, boat, or whereever your courtin'. This guy will be around for a long time if he takes care of him self.  His other stuff is as equally pleasing on the ear.  John's music is more serious than fun, but very mellow, and well written.  Great for driving, boating, chilling, or pleasin' your woman etc..  Some guys might find John's voice a bit soft.. I couldn't care less, this guy is a tremendous guitar player.    Super record -  Fistfull
B003ITMII2|1.0|Somebody cropped this video incorrectly.  You can only see the tops of people's heads.  I checked the same Episode on iTunes and its fine.  This one is not.  Looks like the bottom half of the frame was dropped off and the video stretched to fit?  Not sure.  Anyway, seriously messed up.  Don't buy until Amazon fixes it.  As of 9/2/2010.
0811876373|5.0|I've been following Bakerella's website for a little over a year now. I've created Cake Pops and Cheesecake Pops. I love the spiral bound book because it lays flat. There are a few ideas that were on her website and many more that were not. I was so excited to get my book early. The pictures and step by step instructions are great. Visit her website first, if that is not interesting to you, then this book is not for you.
B002ZG977Y|1.0|I couldn't believe it.  I guess if you've never seen the original with Harry Hamilin, et al, you would think this movie was pretty good.  The Kracken was uglier, the princess was not even pretty, and there were times when my sons and I could actually detect the background as computer generated, called blue screening or something.  Anyway, considering that this is 2010, we expected something much better.  A real disappointment.
0811876373|5.0|This has got to be the best little treat book out ever!! These cute little pops would be perfect to make for a child as well as adults.  The recipe is so easy.  If you don't own this book you are missing out.  I plan on making these with my granddaughter.  A batch of these would be perfect to give as a gift.  I cannot say enough about this book. Thanks so much for writing it. Photo of every pop included.   Just an Update- We are having so much fun making these. My granddaughter is only 5 years old and loves making these as much as grandma does.  We have made so many different ones already.  One of the suppliers we used for the sprinkles and hearts and many of the other decorations was from Millcreekcountrystore.com. They are a great supplier, they even sell samples so you don't need to buy so much and most of the samples are $1.00 and under.  Just an FYI the Wilton food markers do not work well on these pops, use the Americolor ones like it is stated in the supply list in the book. And by the way Bakerella.com Website is so full of more ideas. Thanks Bakerella!! Hope this helps.  Just have to add this. If you are making any of the cake pops that are coated with white chocolate/coating wafers than I strongly suggest using the Merckens Super White coating wafers they come out sooo much better than if you were to use just the white ones.  The Super white is so much brighter. When I used the super white on the chick cake pops they came out to a brighter white. I do not think you can get any whiter than this.   Also if you don't feel like making cake balls, try the oreo cookie truffle balls all you have to do is put 1pkg of oreos in a food processor and chop up until you have fine crumbs and then add 1 8oz. pkg cream cheese and mix together. My cousin used peanut butter cookies instead and everyone loved them.  There are so many combinations you could do. What about thin mint Girl Scout cookies even? Use your imagination and have fun!
B000JMLFLW|3.0|I'm not reviewing the book here, but the free Kindle version. In short: love the book, hate the formatting.<br /><br />There are many typographical errors from simple typos to random line breaks in the middle of paragraphs, often following a title (Mr./Mrs.). For some reason the book is void of italics and emphasized words are in all caps, which is rather ANNOYING, don't you know? The errors haven't kept me from reading, but they are an irritating distraction.<br /><br />If I knew of the slipshod manner in which this book was transcribed I would have just sprung for the $0.89 version. In fact, I think I will now.
B001U0HBPG|1.0|TCCoBB is a terrible film. It's tedious and overlong. The love story is ineffective. Cate Blanchett (bless her heart), as an old woman, gives an uncommonly bad performance that borders on parody. The aging backwards thing is a gimmick which adds nothing to the film. The dialogue and screenplay are the films biggest faults. The screenplay does not have an original idea in its silly head (but plenty of cliches). The dialogue is hammy and unnatural sounding; the film's attempts to be profound fail miserably. The exploration of death is unoriginal; this territory was infinitely better explored in Six Feet Under. What can I praise about this film? Swinton is superb as usual and the only interesting character. Pitt gives a good and convincing performance, even though his character is very bland. The film looks very pretty and the special effects are excellent. None of these things come close to compensating for the films weaknesses though.    Edit: I did not find this film depressing at all since I felt no emotional involvement in what was going on. The screenplay was written by Eric Roth who also wrote Forrest Gump, another monumentally overpraised movie (which is condescending and intelligence insulting as well).
080508990X|4.0|I still love the original book in this series (Brown Bear) best for the cadence of prose and rainbow of characters, but Baby Bear is also a delightful book to have around. It's probably my second-favorite in the series.  My daughter (9 mo) seems to pick it up more than most of her books (it's in about the 10th percentile).  Though whether that's because she loves the animals or just the color yellow, I couldn't tell you.<br /><br />I really like that the animals in this story are wild animals from my continent (though it does seem to be a bit more Western-focused than Eastern -- e.g. mule deer instead of white-tailed deer -- this surprised me as I know Eric Carle has his museum in Western Ma, so I was expecting the fauna to be more local, but it's no big deal, we'll just have to take our daughter to Yosemite some day).  I also like the ending a lot, where the momma bear sees all the animals including her baby bear looking back at her.  Very cute!<br /><br />My only reservation about the book, if you can call it that, is that I can't seem to read it without feeling stilted.  I think it's because of the frequent but not uniform use of the word \\"by\\" (e.g. \\"I see a striped skunk strutting by me.\\"  I keep thinking, \\"do they mean that the skunk is strutting past or strutting near?\\"  The word is used on most of the pages, but not all, and it either feels as though it should be more thoroughly mixed up, or that it should be \\"by\\" in every instance.<br /><br />Obviously, though, these are the ramblings of a mother and not of the target audience.  She seems perfectly delighted with the characters in this story and their actions, be they \\"by,\\" \\"near\\" or \\"at.\\"<br /><br />In summary: it's a cute book.  You should get it for your baby, especially if you're trying to pass on a love of the great American outdoors.
0618918248|5.0|Before you read this book, you should understand that Richard Dawkins has a sense of humor, and is also very polite. I've seen him speak in California, and of course it was as usual impossible for him to avoid the flocks of haters who run to spit on him as he receives any sort of accolade. I believe this time it was an honorary doctorate. Anyway, the man can be cheeky, but he's decent to everyone, and acknowledges that not all religious people are idiots. Unfortunately, the many who are idiots are often so sensitive that the mere statement of a differing opinion is enough to offend them. God forbid that you make a joke at their expense.        There are a lot of very powerful people who believe that we are \\"in the end times.\\" These are people who could have their fingers on the proverbial button someday. This is serious, and yet Dawkins is kind enough to smile about it. He takes the kid gloves off just enough to get his message across, and then pulls them back on in quite a gentlemanly fashion.        If you want to read a book that really viciously mocks the opinions of religious people, this is not the book you should read. I recommend [[ASIN:0061939897 Going Rogue: An American Life]] by Sarah Palin. Here's a sample: \\"I believed we came about through a random process, but were created by God.\\" She uses the past tense because she's talking about 2008... it could be that her analytical skills have since improved.
0439023513|3.0|I get that Collins was probably trying to make a point that war is bad and in many ways, pointless, but when I read a book, it's ALL about the characters I fall in love with. That said, the 'girl on fire' fizzled out (yes, I get that she was abused and exhausted) and ended on a whimper. In fact the end hobbled along instead of with Katniss doing what needed to be done, as always.<br /><br />She should've gone out with  ablaze of glory--even tho that might be unreal in life, it would've wrapped up the book satisfactorily.<br /><br />She should've ended up with Gale. He was her choice. Peeta, while his love was genuine and self-sacrificing--it wasn't asked for, it was foisted on her via the games. And Katniss's last words are about games, so in some ways, that doesn't change. Snow wanted to be convinced of the love between she and Peeta. Did he get what he wanted? Seems like it.<br /><br />Yes, Gale became hardened with a ruthless streak, and yes, he designed the bomb that killed Prim BUT Katniss's fire would've brought him back over time. Her fire should've remained and they would've been so tight, so complete with each other. He took himself out of the love triangle when he realized she would always equate him with Prim's death, and she let him go. I was on Team Gale from moment one.<br /><br />A couple of other points: Katniss killing Coin was brilliant (and gave us the reason why Katniss said yes to more games), but she should've gone from strength to strength, not wasted away for weeks in and out of consciousness only to have everything done when she came to.<br /><br />Finnick deserved more of a eulogy--more of a tribute (if you will). He was a supreme favorite of every reader I know. His death felt insignificant. Especially when I could tell Collins was setting Peeta up to be the one with Katniss at the end, Finnick and Anne's love became THE romance in the book that I was rooting for, because their love was pure, without outside manipulation.<br /><br />All in all the books were well-written and exciting but I feel the author decided to end on a homily about war instead of allowing the character arcs to complete in the way that was the best for all involved.but I feel the author decided to end on a homily about war instead of allowing the character arcs to complete in the way that was the best for all involved.
0553382179|4.0|If you are like me a complete mess, this book and her website are amazing starting points. I am not religious, but spiritual so I just instead of being offended by saying like god breezes think spirit breezes instead. Not keen on the shoe thing b/c my ankles swell a lot especially if I have been working all day.But for some reason the shiny sink thing really does work.    It does help create a starting point to de-cluttering. I have a super short attention span so the 15 thing is excellent.    I probably wouldn't buy the book, I borrowed from the library and the information is available on her website.
0439023513|2.0|*******SPOILER ALERT********  It's sad that the most interesting relationship in the book ends up being with a cat.    Who is the Mockingjay?  I guess that is the question we are supposed to be asking.  Katniss best realized it herself when she thought Peeta finally saw her for who she really was:  petty, selfish, confused, caustic-- nothing worth celebrating.  In the first two books she was all of those things, but those qualities simply made her human, more endearing because they were counterbalanced with an unyielding attitude and a pure love.  In this final act she seems very much a child at an amusement park, taken from ride to ride, with no real participation or coherency to connect them or make them meaningful.  Consequently the reader feels the same way-- slightly amused maybe, but hardly fulfilled.    The problems with the book are many.  And have been well expressed in other reviews.  I will add a few:    Too self aware--  the explanation of the Hangman's Song felt very much like the author patting herself on the back.  Have you ever seen a real poet write a poem and then spend a few pages telling you what they meant?  It was very strange.  Write it well enough that the audience can infer the meaning and then trust the intelligence of your audience.    Confusing storytelling:  It's never a good sign when a key character dies and you aren't sure they died.  As was the case with Prim.  After reading several pages, I had to ask:  \\"Wait, Prim died?\\"  Then go back 4 pages to confirm my suspicion.      Here's what happened:  She relies on this trick way too often.  Knock Katniss out.  Have her wake up.  Summarize what happened.  It's cheap and poor story telling.  For the audience it feels like someone else read the book and is telling you about it, rather than you reading it yourself.  The trial at the end is a perfect example of this.  Katniss kills coin, goes and sleeps it off for however long, ends up back in District 12.  Okay..  ?      Overblown Story:  Itfeels like the story simply got too big and it definitely didn't play to Collin's strength's as a writer.  At times it felt like I was reading scenes that solely existed because they would be cinematic for the eventual movie.  The avalanche scene is a great example of this.  Ultimately pointless, but I bet it will make for good special effects.    Peeta:  I get it.  Peeta is the author's character.  She can do with him what she wants.  But my turning him into a zombie, the story greatly suffered.  Peeta was a great mirror for Katniss.  Her interaction with him gave the original story it's soul. Now the only interaction that feels at all authentic is between Katniss and Buttercup.    In the end, I think the \\"other\\" story might of been the more interesting one.  In the 2nd book Katniss suggests running away with her family and loved ones was her only viable option.  I think that story, set against the backdrop of the Capital takeover, would have been more effective.  It would have kept the story telling intimate and the focused on the characters.  Rather than relegating the \\"Mockingjay\\" to simply serve as the eyes that the audience discovers the horrors of war, the \\"Mockingjay\\" could've been an actual participant in her own story.
0439023483|5.0|The Hunger Games is book 1 in a YA trilogy written by Suzanne Collins.  It is a dystopian story written about future North America after floods, war and famine.  The continent is changed into one large super country called Panem that is made up of a large capital and 13 districts, each in a different area that produces a different resource used by the government to control all of the other districts.  There was a rebellion in the history of Panem in which district 13 was completely destroyed, leaving 12 districts in fear of what could happen to them at any moment.<br /><br />Katniss Everdeen is a 16 yr old girl that lives in district 12, the coal district.  She has lived a hard life in the harshest district.  Katniss lived through her father dying in a mine explosion and her mother turning catatonic after that while she still had a younger sister, Prim, to take care of.  The worst is not even close to over to Katniss, though.  The day of the reaping is coming.  This is where the Capital chooses one boy, 18 and under, and one girl to become the Tributes from each district and these children must fight to the death in a man made arena.  The sole survivor is crowned victor and lavished with gifts and food and a new home and their district is given food and oil for the entire year until the next reaping.  Whose name gets called out at the reaping?  You'll have to read to find out in this electrifying novel that kept me turning pages from beginning to end.<br /><br />Suzanne Collins take a subject (children being required to kill to survive) that could be so repulsive and turns it into a heart stopping story where you can truly love the good guys and they choose to do what's right and good even in the worst of circumstances.  This book is very well written and there is great development to the characters and relationships.  I look forard to reading Catching Fire and Mockingjay, (books 2 and 3).  I already own both and will start them immediately!  So far this series tops my list of favorite YA books.  Of course this trilogy is not suited for everyone.  It is very dark and there are killings and fighting.  Nothing extremely graphic, but enough that you get a really good picture in your head.  I MUCH prefer this over the usual YA fare of romantic mush and teenage drama.  Katniss is a perfect protagonist.  She is incredibly smart and strong, very able bodied and doesn't let her emotions rule her.  She has solid relationships and keeps herself in check.  I love that Katniss is responsible, not just out of obligation but out of love for her sister and out of a knowledge that she must do what's right and what needs to be done.<br /><br />I highly recommend the Hunger Games to any dystopian fans or to anyone looking for something new and exciting to read.  The good news is the 3rd book was released in August so you can read the entire trilogy at once with no waiting!favorite YA books.  Of course this trilogy is not suited for everyone.

0439023513|4.0|Intense doesn't seem to be an adequate enough description for the final installment of this profound trilogy. It starts out a little slow, almost as though Collins is giving us time to fully grasp the enormity of the decision Katniss must make, and is allowing us to catch our breath before Katniss chooses to either embrace her public persona, or fade into the background while the rebels surge forward without her. Collins is certainly not one to coddle her readers or cocoon us in a protective bubble with vague allusions to violence and promises of a better life. No, she thrusts the savagery and cruelty of a society that would sacrifice it's own children for sport right in our faces so that we cannot defensively shield our eyes, but must remain riveted to the page as the horrors unfold one after the other.    Katniss is a changed woman. She still stokes the fires of rebellion with a relentless fervor, but the strength of her conviction seems to have waned, replaced now by confusion and weariness. She's escaped the physical arena only to be catapulted into a political one where the attacks are stealthier and more insidious, the enemy less recognizable, and the endgame nearly impossible to ascertain. No matter which direction she looks, she is but a pawn in someone else's ploy. She's the essential piece in a war not of her making, yet one where responsibility can be ultimately laid at her feet. Her mind is constantly churning, the questions are endless, and those she thought she knew best reveal new colors.    This story is dark. Light is not a luxury Katniss, nor the reader, is afforded. We are confined to underground tunnels with her, and together we all frantically try to claw our way out of the suffocating blackness and find a sliver of hope to which to cling. But we aren't given one. That hope is continually just out of reach, there are no breadcrumbs to follow that lead to home and safety, and there is no guarantee that any of the characters we so love will live to see the end result of their fighting. To be so fully submerged in such desolation is disorienting, unnerving, and completely mesmerizing. It's thrilling to not know which way is up, who to trust, or who will lay down their life for their cause.    My only wish for this story is that Katniss own her emotions a little more. For so long she's been told what to wear, what to say, who to be attracted to, who to stay away from, and ultimately who to be for the camera that's it's robbed her of the ability to decide for herself. We got brief moments of real, genuine emotion from Katniss with regards to Peeta and Gale in the previous novels, and I was hoping that she would step up in this last book, disregard the cameras and the prep teams, and take control of her feelings so that no one else could lay claim to them ever again. She ultimately does make a romantic decision in the end, but it lacks the confidence she shows in other areas.    Though the story is bleak and by the end of her ordeal Katniss's blazing fire has been forcibly extinguished, we are left with the knowledge that the embers have yet to lose their warmth and with the right conditions and a little coaxing, a new flame might flicker to life.    Rating: 4/5
B000MNP2KI|4.0|I liked the movie and the action and of course the poker game,however What is up with the end? I know it's a bond film so anything goes as far as plots and twists,but I hated the ending other than that I really enjoyed the movie.

B0029LX2LC|1.0|Took a chance based on the ratings, but continues the decline since the tipping point.  No standout tunes, and poor production choices keep the \\"almost\\" tunes from breaking through.  Do they need a stronger producer (Scott Storch, where are you)?  Big supporter and will see them live here in Philly, but not worth taking a chance on the new tunes until something pretty dramatic changes.  A shame, but happens to 99% of bands, I guess...
1406711284|5.0|At the beginning of the novel Meursault the main character - who lives in Algiers - gets a message from the home where his mother reside that she passed away. Meursault doesn't show any feeling at all. And during the voyage to that home, the wake and the funeral, and the voyage back home, it's as if his mother never existed or that she's a perfect stranger to him. He spends not a single thought about her.<br /><br />It's a novel about the absurd and the meaningless but also about the indifference of an individual who lives alone, doesn't have any real friends, who knows no happiness and no grief, who really doesn't care about anything or anyone. Though he has a kind of sympathy for a few people he knows, it doesn't mean much because he's a stranger about social life. But he doesn't care about himself either and this is maybe the strangest thing in this novel. He refused an important promotion at his work. It made no difference once again.<br /><br />When on a hot sunday afternoon he walks with a friend along the beach, two Arabs are walking toward them in a hostile manner. Meursault shoots one of them. \\"I don't know why I did it, it had no importance at all\\".<br />From now on his life will take dramatic changes...
0385737947|4.0|this book is good as its title! while reading, i felt like i was really in the situations the characters were in and the description is pretty vivid.  each chapter i read seemed to me like i was watching a really good movie; capturing every conversation, every movement the character was making... However, while reading, you might have to work with the book because it can be confusing at times and its like the movie Inception.  Some of the scenes can be a bit scary too but its fun to enjoy for someone who likes to adventure and who loves a good cliff hanger.
B002SF9YUM|5.0|To be completely honest, I only watched this because it was an early film of Robert Pattinson & I wanted to see how he was as an actor before the Twilight Mania! ...and I completely fell in love! This is one of my favorite movies now! The story is so sad & to know its true is terrible :( But the movie was amazing!
B003NSPUOC|5.0|Books arrived in good condition and very timely. I have only read the first one so far and it did take about 50 pages before I could really get into it. Sure glad I stuck with it because it really is a great read. Looking forward to starting the next one.
B003CIG7AE|4.0|Band of Horses jump to a major label and do the new members shuffle for \\"Infinite Arms.\\" While the result still sounds like the band that recorded \\"Everything All The Time\\" (mainly due to Ben Birdwell's wonderful voice), the band now sounds more like it belongs to Ben than ever before. His voice is now more front and center, the playing tighter and there's less of a dream-world sound than before.<br /><br />This is a mixed blessing. While \\"Infinite Arms\\" feels more like a cohesive record than the previous two, it comes at the expense of the grandiose mood swings those albums owned. Ben is also working on his radio-friendly chops. \\"Laraedo\\" is the obvious ringer, but I was also seriously taken by the Beach Boy harmony on \\"Blue Beard.\\" \\"For Annabelle\\" even comes off as a Southern Rock/Eagles ballad. There's atmosphere to spare all around (and especially on the title track and opener, \\"Factory\\"), so those who did fall in love with the ethereal sounds of the earlier album will find their space.<br /><br />Overall, a solid record, maybe their best. Like Fleet Foxes and My Morning Jacket, Band of Horses is finding a way to stay spatial while still finding their way down to Earth.
0156027321|2.0|I don't have much to say other than that this book should not be put in the same category as books claiming religious revelations.  This book proved fiction is more interesting than life, and did a disservice to the belief in God.  I read it with the whole 'God' concept in mind, and it should not be put in it's advertising.  Merely a ploy to get people to read the book.  The protagonist is very religious but the story does nothing to inspire belief in god, which it falsely claims.  This is a subjective opinion but I belief it falsifies the belief more than anything.

B003H6KRIE|3.0|The story of each are amazing, quality of the first 2 movies were not the best though. Some scenes were a little blurry and some scenes seemed like it was in fast-forward when it was not.  Maybe they were rushed onto this blu-ray package or the films did not transfer well onto it.
B00081U6EG|3.0|It seems I'm not the only viewer disappointed in Fender Guitars 50th Anniversary tribute dvd titled \\"The Strat Pack---Live In Concert.\\" Not to sound redundant with the other reviewers, but how can you possibly have a tribute to Fender guitars and not include Eric Clapton? Everyone has their own opinion has who the best guitar player is, but certainly Eric has to be on everyone's top five list.  I'm not going to be critical of the performers invited, but they certainly would not have been my choices.  Of course David Gilmour was great as always, but he happens to be my all-time favorite guitarist.  But if you're wanting to include guitarist from both genders---how could you have left out Nancy Wilson?  When I got my first glimpse of the concert, it was on a PBS fund raising show if I'm not mistaken, and I only saw Joe Walsh and David Gilmour and I immediately ordered the dvd from Amazon and looked forward to its arrival, but again I must say---I was disappointed! So in closing, I thought the other performers did okay, but just not what I expected for a 50th Anniversary tribute to, I'm assuming what was suppose to be the \\"greatest Fender Strat\\" players. In no way is it a 5 star concert, so I give it a 3 rating. This is the first time I have ever rated a dvd---sorry I haven't been as eloquent with my words compared to the other reviewers.

0439023513|5.0|This is a spoiler free review!    I came into the Hunger Games fandom a little late, just in July, so I didn't have as long as some did to wait for Mockingjay's arrival.  Needless to say I was on pins and needles waiting for the release date to arrive.  When I received my copy I devoured it in under 8 hours (including kid interruptions), and my initial reaction on finishing it was WOW!  The story, characters and descriptions were amazing, I was so engrossed in the book it wasn't like I was reading it, it was like I was living it with Katniss.  Yes, it is depressing, yes it is sad, but that's good because that means it is REAL!  As to the ending, all I will say is that it was perfectly fitting to the story and the series, and the last line...perfection!    It's truly the best series I've read since Harry Potter!

B003S897UK|5.0|O.K., so the last year of the 20th century was 2000, not 1999! Does it really matter, when 3 great CDs of music are finally (after 10 years or so) here from Gov't Mule? And with the late, great Little Milton on several tracks, too! These guys can play anything they like - it all sounds great. A definite must-have for any fine rock/blues library.

B000068PQ0|5.0|I wasn't so sure who the Flaming Lips were until I heard the great song 'Do You Realize?' in a commercial on TV.  Then I realized (pun intended) that it was from the Flaming Lips! This prompt me to buy the album which introduced me to this style of music.  Their sound contains lush, multi-layered, psychedelic rock arrangements. Usually one would skip a track or two or more but I listen to every track on this album. It has a cohesive theme/concept. In fact, they are actually creating a musical play off it.  And though Wayne Coyne's vocals are quite thin and weak (he struggles on some notes), the musical arrangements are mesmerizing enough to offset it.  I believe this is their best work, yes even better than their breakthrough album Soft Bulletin.
1582406723|5.0|Quick & Dirty: This darkly dangerous tale pulls you into an apocalyptic world of zombies, mayhem, and cannibals.  You can run, but you can't hide.  You are The Walking Dead...<br /><br />Opening Sentence: This is not good.<br /><br />The Review:<br /><br />This October a new series on AMC, The Walking Dead, will premier.  Frank Darabont, director of The Mist, one of my favorite horror movies, is the new series' writer, director and producer.  I knew The Walking Dead was based on the comic book of the same name, so I decided to check out the source material, and wow!  I'm glad I did.  The Walking Dead by Robert Kirkman & Tony Moore (with help from Cliff Rathburn) is among the greats of the genre, comfortably sharing the stage with Dawn of the Dead, 28 Days Later and Max Brooks' World War Z.  The Walking Dead is, if nothing else, certainly the best zombie comic to date.  Admittedly, as a sporadic comic reader, I had really low expectations before I sat down to read this series.  I'm pleased to say that Robert Kirkman shattered my expectations and that The Walking Dead is genuinely one of the most compelling stories I've ever read in any format.<br /><br />Volume 1: Days Gone By covers issues 1-6, which follows Rick Grimes, a small-town sheriff.  Rick awakens in an abandoned hospital (evoking a little d&eacute;j&agrave; vu for those of us familiar with 28 Days Later).  It isn't long before Rick realizes something horrible has happened while he's been in a coma because there are bodies everywhere.  Worse still, Rick soon discovers that these corpses don't stay still.  They roam.  They lurk.  But worst of all, they bite. Rick and his family, along with other scattered survivors, struggle to survive in a world overrun by the walking dead.  Survivors are outnumbered and completely fu*@ed.  You'll quickly get swept up in Rick's story.  You'll find yourself hoping for the best, but also dreading what might lurk around the corner, under every car, and behind every closed door.  Kirkman excels at conveying an almost palpable sense of dread and the result is no one EVER feels safe.<br /><br />This is a character driven story and is as much about each character trying to cope with their new reality as it is about huge action scenes.  Quite naturally, this new reality takes its toll mentally and physically.  The constant threat of death from the walking dead is only part of the horror.  Indeed, the living are to be feared as much as the dead.  Sometimes more so.  Much of the story of The Walking Dead centers around whether people are fundamentally good or whether in times of crisis they will do anything to survive.  Are you willing to do anything, and I mean anything, to survive?  Will you leave a friend to die to save yourself? Would you kill to save yourself?  Would you kill to save your child?<br /><br />The artwork for The Walking Dead is beautiful.  Every emotion is captured with great detail by Tony Moore and Cliff Rathburn.  It takes real talent to draw ordinary people.  An old man or a scrawny teenager is a lot harder to draw than a brawny spandex clad superhero.  The artists pay just as much attention to the decaying cityscapes and to the undead themselves.  It's amazing that no two walking dead ever seem to look alike and quite a tribute to the ample artistic talents of Tony Moore and Cliff Rathburn.<br /><br />The Walking Dead is a MUST read series.  It's well written, finely detailed in black and white, and addictive.  Trust me; the only thing tougher than trying to survive the zombie apocalypse is having to wait for the next issue.<br /><br />The Walking Dead Series:<br /><br />1. Volume 1: Days Gone Bye<br /><br />2. Volume 2: Miles Behind Us<br /><br />3. Volume 3:Safety Behind Bars<br /><br />4. Volume 4: The Heart's Desire<br /><br />5. Volume 5: The Best Defense<br /><br />6. Volume 6: The Sorrowful Life<br /><br />7. Volume 7: The Calm Before<br /><br />8. Volume 8: Made to Suffer<br /><br />9.

0385342039|5.0|I love to read and like anyone who loves to read, I have my favorite authors and favorite books by them.  Well, Sophie Kinsella has become a favorite and \\"Twenties Girl\\" is way at the top of her list!  How to describe the way Ms Kinsella can have you believing wholeheartedly in the great-aunt ghost who is haunting her great-neice until she finds a favorite necklace?  If someone had told me the plot ahead of time and I didn't already love Sophie Kinsella, I think I might have passed.  But oh boy - I already miss Sadie and Lara and the necklace!  I don't know how she does it, but I laugh out loud one minute and cry the next.  The only thing I can compare the feeling to is how I feel at the end of \\"It's a Wonderful Life\\" - like life is pretty good and each and every one of us is special and important.  Oh heck - I hope she does a whole series of \\"Lara\\" books like the \\"Shopaholic\\" series!
B002HWRYJE|4.0|First,let me say that Leonard Nimoy's Spock has always been my favorite Star Trek character.  I was very pleased, in this new version, to see more of Spock's human qualities.  Although only half-Vulcan, his demeanor (while I loved it!) was always in full-Vulcan mode.  I like the new side to Spock, and I like the romance between Spock and Uhura.  Although I originally liked William Shatner's Jim Kirk, over time I began to find the character pompous, arrogant, and full of himself.  It's interesting, and very realistic to me, that the young Jim Kirk had those characteristics in abundance!  In all, I like the direction that this reboot to the classic series is taking.  I enjoyed the movie and look forward to its sequel.
0439023513|4.0|I liked this book quite a bit, and while I did feel that it was different from The Hunger Games and Catching Fire, I didn't necessarily think it was a bad thing.<br /><br />Was it dark? Yes.<br /><br />Did it need to be? Probably.<br /><br />I think that in order to realistically end this series, there isn't much that Suzanne Collins could have done differently than what she did in this final installment.<br /><br />What I do wish, though, is that more time could have been spent with Peeta while he recovered. I missed his character in this book, and while I think that's probably what the author intended, I think that the transition from him being completely insane to being somewhat normal wasn't shown well enough.<br /><br />And, for me, the romance aspect of these books wasn't concluded well enough, either. I almost wish that the author had just left out the last few pages where Katniss chooses Peeta, they have kids, and live happily (sort of) ever after. It wasn't handled well, and I dislike when an author uses a \\"years later\\" scenario to show that things eventually end up okay. It cheapens the experience. It isn't the \\"all ends up okay\\" part that is interesting, it's how they get to that point. It wouldn't really matter to me that much except for that I believe Suzanne Collins is a better writer than that.<br /><br />Overall, I liked the book. It was very entertaining and I was unable to put it down the whole time I was reading it, so that goes to show something. While I feel the ending could have used another fifty pages or so, perhaps that's just me wishing that there were more of this series to enjoy.
B002BU0DPE|5.0|I read some negative reviews and i was like whatever i will try them and they just got here yesterday and everything feels so different and good the bass is awesome specially for call of duty its just awesome people don't think about it just order one and you will feel the difference in your gaming!
B001C4AFOY|5.0|This is probably the best period movie I have seen to date. The actors are perfectly cast, costumes are gorgeous, scenery and sets are outstanding. This is a love story that continued for the entire life of Queen Victoria. The movie inspired me to later watch the dvd \\"Mrs. Brown.\\" Young Victoria is definitely 5 stars*****
030726999X|2.0|Have to agree with all the two- and three-star reviews of this, the third act in the Millenium (Blomkvist-Salander) Trilogy.  The first hundred pages or so are okay, as are the last 100 or so... but my goodness, the middle (bulk) of this story is tedious and mind-numbing for the most part, with tons of 'bit players' entering the plot, which focuses endlessly on uncovering the sordid timeline of 'the Section' and the 'Zalachenko Affair' -- most of these players having difficult-to-keep-straight Swedish last names, which decreases the overall pleasurability (and increases the confusion) in plowing through this third installment. Ultimately I'm sure most fans of the first two books -- both of which I give a solid 4 or 5 stars -- will be glad they finished the trilogy, and the ending is satisfying (if somewhat predictable).<br />But overall I have to tell it like it is: this one was not up to the same standards of story-telling and pacing as the first two.
0439023513|5.0|I LOVED \\"Mockingjay\\" and was very pleased when I finished reading it!  I had been REALLY concerned when I read some of the negative reviews, but now that I've recieved my copy and read it I must totally disagree with those negatives.  I don't understand how someone familiar with the series would be unhappy reading this, as it is very much in keeping with the last two books.<br /><br />It is true that there is a lot of darkness in this book - just as there was in the other two. I think the characters remain true to the identies they had already established, and the plot resolves to a very natural conclusion of the series, and it is a very exciting trip and keeps you turning the pages!
0307454541|3.0|Although I am not really a mystery fan, if a book is well written, I am more than happy to dig in. With all the hype surrounding this series and friends who loved this book I was really hoping to enjoy this book. I thought it would be somehow different. From the very beginning I found it to be quite formulaic, very much a mystery novel. Which is fine if that's what you're in to. The title character is interesting, and parts of the book are engrossing, but on the whole I found it to be very unevenly written and really not that good. I liked the second book even less. I was really expecting more.
B000002VMH|1.0|I bought this CD after listening it at my co-worker's Ipod.  He told me about it and I listened to the entire CD.

It is a great CD and I am so enthusiastic about it that I recommend it to everyone that listen to it.

B003OFHMKO|5.0|This is a great album.  As much as I enjoyed \\"Esperanza\\"--her second album--I must say that \\"Chamber Music Society\\" is a definitive leap forward.  Her voice texture is richer, her compositions/arrangements are beyond impressive, and her musicianship is inspiring.  Two thumbs up!
B003L77TZI|5.0|i cant say how amazing this album is, at first i was feeling very EH about it, but it soo grew on me. katy comes off fun flirty then downright serious and wistful from the crazy PEACOCK to the amazing CIRCLE THE DRAIN the latter being my favorite of the album. the most notables are:<br /><br />teenage dream<br />peacock<br />circle the drain<br />et<br />who am i living for!<br /><br />a must have top five of the year!!
B0036EH3WK|5.0|They may have gotten skimpy on the quality with the season 5 disks, but this complete blu-ray collection is AWESOME.  There are of course easter eggs/hidden info inside.  This is perfect for a true lost fan.

B00138J8SS|5.0|The album was a turning point in the history of guitar playing. Joe went a next step after guitar heroes such as Jimi Hendrix or Eddie Van Halen and set a new standard of guitar mastery. Exteremely recommended.

1401219268|5.0|The watchmen is a perfect example of the common saying that graphic novels are comic books for adults.  The complex themes in this book would evoke the envy of many an author of more classic tomes.  When Dr. Manhattan's discussion with Laurie descends in to a soulless scientific materialism which is rescued when he realizes that human creation is more amazing than any process in the universe it is on par with any monologue.  Rorschach's nihilism and destruction of the ideas of fate and divine intervention is powerfully portrayed through his monologue which leaves his arrogant psychologist sobered and contemplating these words in the dark.  These are philosophical themes for modern times expressed as well as any of the themes discussed by Dostoyevsky or Trotsky, who expressed deeper philosophical themes within popular storytelling.  Great scenes such as those described above amidst a world which is pervaded by the feeling of armageddon, so prevalent during the cold war make this a chilling novel to read.

B002N5N5M0|5.0|This is one of those shows that gets better every year. I'm a fan of John Lithgow's from 3rd Rock from the Sun, in which he plays an alien trying to pass as a human (\\"Dick Solomon\\") in order to learn about human culture. He is over-the-top, silly, in-your-face. John Lithgow is something very different in Dexter. He is subtle, sinister, chilling to watch. So much of the evil he portrays in this exists in the real world, with regular people, every day. I kid you not when I say this season of Dexter gave me nightmares.  I loved Jimmy Smitts as Miguel last season, but this season just had something extra. It takes a couple episodes to get into this season, but once you do, it's twist after twist after twist. It was even better the second time.   Congrats on the Emmy, John! You deserve it.
0439023513|5.0|I think Mockingjay was the best of the three.  Well written.  The story was bleak and sad, but how can it be otherwise given the premise.
B003UPPO2G|5.0|Actually, it's been 12 years and not ten for this tenth anniversary issue, not that that matters much.  This is a rehash of old material and a little bit of new.  Repackaged in a new clear plastic case with color inserts, it's a bit better and brighter looking.  But what's inside?<br /><br />The song set is the same as any of the previous versions.  The DVD arrangement is different.  The sound quality is actually just as good with the options of Dolby Digital Stereo, Dolby Digital 5.1 and DTS Surround; maybe better.  On my surround system, they all sounded good. There is a new segment of \\"An Audience with the Bee Gees\\" in a more intimate setting where they perform five good songs to an appreciative audience.  This is in stereo only.  There is a larger concert of this version available if you search.<br /><br />The extras include a live segment (audience with the Bee Gees) that have the songs, \\"Heartbreaker\\", \\"Guilty\\", a rousing \\"Chain Reaction\\", \\"How Deep Is Your Love\\" and \\"Jive Talkin'\\".  The interview is interesting including previously seen segments and several new ones that were pulled from the vaults.  It lasts a satisfying 19 minutes.  For an Anniversary issue, it's not bad.<br /><br />However, if you really want a bargain deal and ALL that the Bee Gees can offer, I highly suggest buying the [[ASIN:B0000EMYC2 Bee Gees - One Night Only / The Official Story]] (Collector's Edition).  This has the entire concert on one disc and a 2-hour interview on a second.  There are plenty of extras as well.  Sit down and have a great time in your living room.<br /><br />Can I brag?  At 18:43 minutes into the interview, I can see myself sitting in the 3rd row of the MGM Grand bleachers.  That is such a thrill for me.

B002VECMAE|3.0|Based on a novel and partially true tales.  The movie attempts to be zany in certain parts while also trying to deliver a message of the need for Jedis.  Star Wars fans will love it when Ewan McGregor asks, \\"What's a Jedi?\\"  The movie tries to take us on the hero's spiritual quest to enlightenment but this is really hard to pull off normally and then adding the zany element makes it even harder.  There's an impressive cast in this picture that tells me it started with high expectations but the delivery was only somewhat good instead of very good, great or superlative.  WHEN WATCHED: 08/31/2010; MY GRADE: B minus to B.
B000F5FR0S|5.0|Watching what people say, what people do, I seriously rolled my eyes at all the hype around this. Yes, Leonardo DiCaprio gets the star roll of Dennis Lehane's bestseller, so that means you have to appreciate it! Right? Or is it simply a case where Dennis Lehane is actually that good at what he does? Let's just put it this way...I'm not exactly the world's biggest Leonardo DiCaprio fan, so I wasn't about to watch the movie until I read the book. And I was treated to a great psychological thriller with plot twists I couldn't have imagined! One reviewer said that after the final chapter, he went back and read the prologue all over again. Good idea!<br /><br />So, we meet a man named Teddy Daniels, and we meet his partner, Chuck. Teddy is off to Shutter Island to find a missing patient, Rachel Solando, who murdered her three children. But what the heck is this place? Nothing is what it appears to be, and Teddy is in for a rude awakening! Crazy people, hurricanes, experiments with drugs, lobotomies & nobody has a straight answer for any of it! And the good Doctor stands by, while everybody smokes their cigarettes. What's Teddy Daniels gotten himself into? The memory of his beloved wife brings him little comfort.<br /><br />To say the least, I was hooked! And Dennis Lehane proves he's a master with his words. This Boston native hooks you into the depths of the insanity, and keeps you there to endure it to the final page. And if I do say so myself, it wasn't a mistake to give this man a chance. I'm glad I did. He's on my list of authors to read from this point on. And now for that movie...
B001OQCV2E|3.0|The director of INDEPENDENCE DAY tries to bring us another disaster blockbuster picture, though, this one doesn't quite hit the mark in storytelling.  It did well at the box office so expect a sequel or spin off.  Tale focuses on several main and subplot stories taking place as the Earth's core prepares to destroy the planet.  There are a ton of awesome special effects in this picture and that's what pushed it up to a three star.  The story is mediocre to poor in certain places with some high points where it seems to be going well and then just fails to deliver.  So if you love CGI and the like this is the movie for you if you love disaster films.  Now, if you really want to see an \\"A\\" quality disaster film there are several but I'm thinking of the 70s TOWERING INFERNO at the moment.  WHEN WATCHED: 08/30/2010; MY GRADE: B minus.
B003JTHETY|4.0|Now that I have your attention, let me explain what I mean. The new Iron Maiden album is really a fine piece of work. The music and vocals are top-notch, and the band seems to have loads of energy left in them. However, it is the PACE of the new album that will play games with your head. Iron Maiden seems to drift on a long-voyage throughout most of the new material. It is like \\"Piece Of Mind\\" album blends in with Pink Floyds \\"Wish You Were Here\\". Both of which appeared on the scene many years ago. I have actually fallen asleep four different times while listening to \\"The Final Frontier\\". The music has a strange \\"calming\\" effect on me. I am not used to Iron Maiden songs stretching out so long that they actually become non-threatening to the point of serenity! Still, I really like the music, and I find it to be quite compelling. I just hope that I will get to the point at which I can listen to it in its entirety without waking up four hours later with fleeting visions of an elusive dream! How will Iron Maiden go on tour with music that would thrill fans of the Grateful Dead and Fleetwood Mac? Time will Tell...

0670021652|1.0|I only tried to read this because it came free on my Sony e-reader. I was not a huge fan of Eat, Pray, Love and am even less of a fan of this book.  It is dull, boring and I think in part- made up.  Elizabeth Gilbert starts out the book apologizing over and over again (I'm not a historian, I'm not an anthropoligist) enough already, we know who you are- just write the book. She then goes into great detail about how this is a book about WESTERN marriage and then proceeds to start it off by talking about the Hmong women of Vietnam...huh?  As a reader, I felt confused and duped. She gives two different examples of people who had more or less arranged marriages who could not remember meeting their spouse-(ie because it just wasn't that important), early courtship, etc. I find this highly unlikely. Partly because I AM a social scientist and know from interviewing many, many people that life-changing events such as meeting your spouse (in whatever social construction that might be) is remembered, in detail.  The worst part is that she goes on and on, goes off on tangents and then you forget what she is even talking about in the first place. She is like a really boring, really chatty neighbor you just can't get away from. Well, I can get away from her, I'm not going to finish the book!0

0439023513|2.0|Just to sum up my point, I agree with everyone when saying I was disappointed in the way the story took place. I loved the first book, but instead of the writing getting better it got worse. Katniss was no longer the heroin we all loved, but a frazzled mess who didn't know which way to turn. Will def read the first book over and over again, but that is where my fascination with the series will die.

In fact, I have never seen him in a bad film, or giving less than a stellar performance.<br /><br />I have never seen Rie Rasmussen before, but she is terrific too, and should have a promising career ahead of her, based on her performance in this film.

0374158460|5.0|Barack Obama went to Martha's Vineyard and there obtained, a week before its release, a copy of Jonathan Franzen's novel. That same week, my family was heading to the Bahamas, and because we'd be isolated on a island three miles long and half a mile wide, with spotty internet access and even more problematic electricity, I was able to convince the publisher to give me an embargoed copy of the book.<br /><br />I doubt that the President has made his way through all 562 pages of \\"Freedom.\\" My wife and I have made it to the end. It required no effort of will, just a little negotiation (\\"I'll take the kid to the beach if you'll use the time to read\\"). That is how, on our final morning overlooking the pink sands where Corona makes its wish-you-were-there beer commercials, I staggered to the end, sobbing as I read the last ten pages. My wife finished the book while we waited for our baggage in New York, and then couldn't speak for most of the cab ride home.<br /><br />What's the big deal?<br /><br />The people.<br /><br />Not the characters. The people. Men and women we come to know and care about, not because they're so admirable but because they're so real.<br /><br />Like Patty Berglund, a former college basketball star, now a stay-at-home mom. In her slowly gentrifying neighborhood in St. Paul, Minnesota, she was, Franzen writes, \\"already fully the thing that was just starting to happen to the rest of the street.\\" That is: \\"a morning of baby-encumbered errands, an afternoon of public radio, the Silver Palate Cookbook, cloth diapers, drywall compound and latex paint, and then Goodnight Moon, then zinfandel.\\" The questions that plagued her: \\"Where to recycle batteries? ... How elaborate did a kitchen water filter need to be? ...Could coffee beans be ground the night before you used them, or did this have to be done in the morning?\\"<br /><br />Like Walter Berglund, her husband. Son of a man who owned a small motel in Hibbing --- yes, that Hibbing, where Bob Zimmerman grew up and dreamed himself into Bob Dylan --- he was the very nice guy you never really knew in college because he was studying so hard and working his way through school. He'd met Patty there and knew she was The One, and waited for her to know it. And when she said yes, and shared that her dream was motherhood, he shelved every exalted ambition to get a job in Corporate Communications at 3M. When we meet him, he's the executive director of Minnesota's Nature Conservancy, having trouble with his teen-aged son, about to move to Washington for a new job --- he'll sell his St. Paul house \\"near the bottom of the post-9/11 slump.\\"<br /><br />One more character drives this novel, Walter's college roommate and unlikely best friend. Richard Katz is the leader of nihilistic rock bands, and he's made for the part: talk, dark and arrogant, deadly attractive to women and eager to exploit that attraction. You don't want the truth served up with nasty spin? Keep away from Richard.<br /><br />Patty keeps away. Not because she dislikes Richard --- she craves him. But she's made her choice: a man who will do anything to create a home with her. Hot sex? It passes. It has to. Except that....<br /><br />This is Fiction 101: Building Characters, and if you're surprised how hard it grabs you, it's because today's most acclaimed fiction is too \\"literary\\" to care more about people than language or structure or the next definition of fiction. Franzen, like Balzac and Dickens, is a journalist at heart --- what he's created in \\"Freedom\\" is this generation's \\"Bonfire of the Vanities.\\"<br /><br />The mark of this kind of novel is not only that it feels true but that it becomes true. There's a sequence here about American profiteering during the early days of the Iraq War that's excruciating in its account of American officials who didn't give a damn. Now, as the war \\"ends, recent articles remind us of billions lost and unaccounted for. These crimes, for the government, are consigned to a memoryhole. But there's no lack of accountability here. Not on Franzen's watch.<br /><br />Look anywhere in this novel, and you'll see how it defines our time. Like that bird on the cover. It's not decorative. It's going to have its own preserve in West Virginia, courtesy of a billionaire who will, in exchange for a few protected acres, get to blow up mountains and harvest coal. And just as we're reading this, here is Jane Mayer's revelatory New Yorker profile of David and Charles Koch, the billionaires whose companies pollute and despoil while David gives hundreds of millions to Lincoln Center, the American Museum of Natural History, and the Metropolitan Museum of Art.<br /><br />Let's consider the title. Franzen's characters are not like the Koch brothers or the coal magnate or the Iraq fraudsters. They are their victims, living in an America where we make our biggest choices as shoppers. It's a dreary, ugly culture. Even Walter --- staid Walter --- comes to make a surprising indictment: \\"As long as you've got your six-foot-wide-plasma TV and the electricity to run it, you don't have to think about any of the ugly consequences. You can watch 'Survivor: Indonesia' till there's no more Indonesia!\\"<br /><br />The personal quarrels? Just as lacerating. I can't imagine having a fight with my wife as ugly as the ones in these pages. But they're not set-pieces. They're the intimate moments of people whose conflicts, though maybe not ours, are recognizable to us. And when those fights end, sometimes there is clarity, even beauty:<br /><br />\\"She cried then, torrentially, and he lay down with her. Fighting had become their portal to sex, almost the only way it ever happened anymore. While the rain lashed and the sky flashed, he tried to fill her with self-worth and desire, tried to convey how much he needed her to be the person he could bury his cares in. It never quite worked, and yet, when they were done, there came a stretch of minutes in which they lay in the quiet majesty of long marriage, forgot themselves in shared sadness and forgiveness for everything they'd inflicted on each other, and rested.\\"<br /><br />\\"The quiet majesty of long marriage\\" --- that phrase stopped me cold and led me back to the ultimate subject of this book, which is, I think, the challenge of building a functional romantic partnership when you're carrying the legacy of your flawed family and your country's dishonest and exploitative culture. Again, I suspect this challenge isn't unique to Patty and Walter Berglund. It's mine, for sure. And, just maybe, yours.<br /><br />And that is why the end is so devastating. It's richly symbolic --- and, for once, the symbol works. It sets our fond hopes against our hard realities. It reminds us of the limits of our personal power.

B003HLM2QO|1.0|By far this cd is the worst ozzy has done yet ! The lyrics are stupid and meaningless. This new guitar player sounds like he's playing the music that zakk wyld wrote for ozzy in the first place. I haven't disliked an ozzy album since zakk has been in the band. But theres a first time for everything. Don't buy this album, instead get B.L.S. Order of the Black and ozzy for godsake get zakk back before you kill your career !
0743289684|5.0|It is a fantastic, honest, gut wrenching story that every woman and man should read. A friend gave it to me and from the moment I opened the cover I couldn't put it down. If you are interested in Islam, Africa, a woman's journal, female genital mutilation (the true story), immigrating to Europe or the US or cultural life in Holland this book is for you!
B003QZ5222|4.0|As a long time fan holding onto original vinyl copies of Springsteen's pre-Tunnel of Love recordings, I was pleased to discover this box set.  The music contained within is extraordinary, without doubt 5/5 material, reflecting Springsteen's growth as an artist, from early, wordy Dylan clone to his present day status as \\"The Boss\\".  What I do feel a need to review is the actual packaging.  The box itself is simple yet handsome and the cds contained within are housed in mini-LP replicas of the original vinyl.  So far so good but on closer inspection, here's where the problems with this collection begin.  Gatefolds are not reproduced (with the exception of The River, a 2-LP collection not originally released in a gatefold!), so we miss Born to Run's iconic wraparound sleeve (Greetings from Asbury Park, NJ, also suffers from this, but at least the lyrics here are reproduced).  Also, none of the inner lyric (except as noted above) or picture sleeves have been reproduced, either in the cd cases or the accompanying booklet.  In fact, the booklet is completely redundant, simply copying the front record covers and some rudimentary session info contained on the back covers.  Why did Sony not go the extra mile to reproduce the COMPLETE original vinyl packages, like the recent, highly celebrated Japanese mini-Lp reissues?  Although Sony should be commended for offering this collection at such a low cost (around $40 compared to the Beatles Stereo box at around $150!) surely most fans would have spent the extra $5 or so for the extra attention to details. Regardless, this is an excellent bargain introduction to one of the great American artists of the past 50 years.  Music 5/5  Packaging 3/5
0765326353|5.0|The Way of Kings is the first in a multi-volume Fantasy Epic from New York Times best-selling author Brandon Sanderson, now known best as the author chosen to finish out one of the most beloved series known to modern Fantasy, namely The Wheel of Time. However intimidating it must have been for Sanderson to take over WoT, he knowing only committed himself to two or three volumes, but with The Way of Kings he has already stated it will be at least ten volumes. Is this the first case of an author ever realizing from the start how long it may take to tell a story properly? If so Sanderson is in a class all of his own making.     Sanderson has given his fans exactly what they wanted: a book filled with a new magic system, a wondrous and violent world, and characters you'll grow to cherish like old friends. I managed to finish The Way of Kings over a few long days staying up well past midnight more than one night because it was that captivating. Sanderson clearly has been thinking about this world and its races for some time and his love of them shines through to the reader.    The Way of Kings is sprawling in every way that is good and epic to its utmost. The world-building is immense to say the least, but Sanderson smartly decides to focus on the characters while still slipping in facts about the world, history, and the cultures. At a few points the narrative turns into an info dump, but that feels like what is needed to flesh things out a bit more as the desire for more knowledge of this world and its deep mythology infects you.    War between the Alethi and Parshendi has been on-going after the Parshhendi killed the Alethi King Galivar. The two sides have been fighting daily to a stalemate for many years on the Shattered Plains, which is one of the most fractious battlefields found in Fantasy. The very land has been split like a puzzle with deep chasms separating one plateau from the next. In order to move troops from one plateau to the next movable bridges are needed. The swiftest bridges are carried by slaves known as bridgemen.     The Way of Kings is about the truth and how it becomes legend, which changes and gets reinterpreted with time. Heroes become heretics, the lawless become laws givers, and once great places become shattered. The world is known as Roshar, which suffers highstorms that are so violent and frequent that the very ground is eroded away and life on the planet has evolved to survive. Think land creatures that have shells and plants that close up. The flora and fauna were at first very difficult to picture, but some art strewn through the book helps visualization. These highstorms also somehow distribute energy known as Stormlight that is involved in the magic of the land, which I found to be a great concept.    The story is told from 4 main character points of view, well, really 3 and the son of another from time-to-time. There are also a couple sections known as \\"interludes\\" told from characters not involved in the main action. The inclusion of these sections puzzles me a little, but Sanderson is likely laying the groundwork for the introduction of characters in future volumes to tell the story from more points of view as the telling grows and action varies from region to region.     The two most prevalent characters are Kaladin and Dalinar. Kaladin is a fearsome warrior whose luck ran out after he pushed it a few too many times. His story splits between present day and flashbacks all the way to his childhood leading up to his fall from grace and eventual slave life as a bridgeman in the Shattered Plains. The divergent storylines never appear unnecessary, but Kaladin's back-story does go on too much. Sanderson hammers home just how much Kaladin suffers and what brought him to his bridgeman status, but does so to a degree I found a bit repetitive. Two or three flashbacks could have been eliminated and still had the same effect. Also, one flashback that was built over the course of half the book, which seemed to shape Kaladin so much from his early warrior years felt underwhelming when finally revealed. Kaladin's present story were the sections I most look forward to as his abilities shine even when covered in dirt and we get to see a broken man become whole again.    Dalinar a High Price of Alethkar is Uncle to the current King of the realm after his brother Gavliar was murdered. Much of what Dalinar does is driven by his need to do what is right, which is not always seen as what is best for him politically. Because of this he comes off a bit flat, but his action sequences were some of the most edge grabbing parts. Dalinar's scenes of prophetic/ecstatic visions don't make much sense at first, but when the last two comes they are humdingers. Dalinar is a Shardbearer like his son Adolin(another point of view at times). Both wear Shardplate and have a Shard blade, which are incredibly durable and enhance the wearer's strength and stamina and therefore make them the most formidable warriors around. (And yes all the capitalization do get tiresome after awhile.) The Shards are a relic from a time now gone into myth and are coveted by all. At first it seemed like the Shards were very rare, but as more pop-up their lustre is somewhat dimmed yet when they get involved in a melee things pick-up. There are promises of even great power and magic coming back into the land.    Shallan is the third main view and her storyline while the most sedate in comparison to the battle laden Kaladin and Dalnar was also the most intriguing and played out very much like a spy thriller. Her story takes place away from the Shattered Plains, but does involve some overall intrgue that will propel the series forward. She is trying to save her family by becoming an apprentice to Jasnah the sister to the King, but she clearly had a lot happen to her in the past most of which is only alluded to. Shallan grows so much in the pages that she became the character I wish I could speed ahead in the series inorder to find out what is in store for her in the next volume as she will be in the thick of the march soon enough.    At more than 1,000 pages The Way of Kings does come off as slightly bloated, but keep in mind there are around 30 pages full of art as Tor spared no expense in bringing us a book that nearly rivals a Subterranean Press edition. Plus, The Way of Kings has a surprisingly complete narrative as both the characters and storyline move forward. There were some expected coming together of characters in the end, but they were all ones I had been hoping for. The aspect of the spirit-like spren seem mostly window dressing that didn't add much to the story at this point except for one very odd one. There were too many types of spren that kept popping up in nearly every chapter to the point they lost their allure for me. Deathspren, windspren, painspren, rotspren, joyspren, etc. Maybe they'll turn out to be more in later volumes. But all flaws are minor quibbles and hardly detracted from the enjoyment factor.    Is it Dune as the back cover of the galley suggests? Well, no. And that's an unfair comparison to make. Was Dune as revered when it first came out? Or The Wheel of Time? No. They earned their place after years, if not decades, of growing fandom and buildings of their worlds. But Sanderson has laid the groundwork for a series that has the propensity to be up there with the other giants if he can develop what he has begun into something just as memorable. The Way of Kings contains characters who you'll miss when their section ends and a setting that begs to be explored. The Stormlight Archive series could quite possibly be up there with Jordan, Eddings, and dare I say Tolkien when all is said and done. This is without a doubt the most epic Fantasy novel of the year and should not be missed by any fans of the genre.    I've only scratched the surface with this review as there is plenty of political backstabbing, great battles, secret organizations, detailson the magic system, and intrigue happening as well. As a whole we only get an inkling of what this series has in store for us, but it is more than enough to leave me satisfied.  Sanderson is at the top of his game and on to something with this world known as Roshar, which however inhospitable is a place I hope to return to over many, many years to grow alongside the characters. I give The Way of Kings 9 out of 10 hats. Also, be sure to re-read the prologue about a third of the way through. It will make much more sense and help things click into place a bit better. The follow-up to The Way of Kings will most likely not be out until at least 2012 as Sanderson has pledged to finish the last WoT book before beginning work, which I can't fault him for wanting to do. Why haven't we just figured out how to clone this guy yet?

0553805371|5.0|As I see it, [[ASIN:0553805371 The Grand Design]] was written with two purposes.<br /><br />The first, less controversial reason for its existence is to repackage the author's previous works - an Even Briefer History of Time, perhaps? - into a volume that could be subtitled \\"what we now know\\". Hawking and collaborator Leonard Mlodinow condense millennia of scientific advancement into just a few short chapters, then make their case that M-theory (a unification of the various string theories) is the best candidate for a complete model of our universe, the best method to reach a complete understanding of it. The supporting evidence for this view is laid out clearly and systematically, making cosmology accessible to the layman - not an easy task!<br /><br />The second purpose of this book was to deliver a message to Religion, that message being \\"your services are no longer needed. Science has either answered the great questions of life or rendered them meaningless. This we do not ask you to accept on faith - we can prove it with mathematics and computer models, if you are smart enough to comprehend them\\".<br /><br />Many will be offended by [[ASIN:0553805371 The Grand Design]], and a great deal more will reject it... regardless, it is hard not to view its message as Professor Hawking's parting gift to the world.
B00000633U|4.0|This 1989 album was a worthy follow up to Marx's impressive debut album & it contains plenty of great guitar driven rock songs as well as several nice ballads. It also spawned 5 hit singles.  \\"Satisfied\\" which was the first hit single, reached #1 on the charts & is a great high energy rocker. \\"Right Here Waiting\\" was also a #1 hit & was one of Marx's finest ballads.  The last hit to chart in the top 5 was the underrated \\"Angelia\\". A beautiful & moving ballad that deserved more airplay than it got. The other 2 singles were the medium rocker: \\"Too Late to Say Goodbye\\" & the slow ballad \\"Children of the Night\\".  They weren't quite as strong as the first 3 singles but were still pretty decent songs.  I personally think that the harder rocking tracks \\"That was Lulu\\" & \\"If You Don't Want My Love\\" would've made much better singles than the 2 aforementioned songs.  They are both more melodic & radio friendly & are right up there with the 3 big hits quality wise. Especially \\"If You Don't Want My Love\\" which was co-written by the \\"The Tube's\\" lead singer - Fee Waybill.  It is a high energy rocker with terrific guitar work by Marx's longtime guitarist - Bruce Gaitsch & if you've ever had your heart broken, you'll definitely be able to relate to the lyrics.  Fee also co-wrote \\"Too Late to Say Goodbye\\" & sings b/g vocals as well. There are also several other guest artists on this album that were the cream of L.A. session players at the time.  Guys like: Randy Jackson (yes that one), Steve Lukather (Toto), Bill Champlin (Chicago) & the Amazing Jazz saxophonist - Dave Koz. Many other lesser known but still outstanding musicians play a part on this album too & they along with a fantastic  bunch of songs, make this one of the best offerings in Marx's impressive catalog.
0385474547|5.0|There are certain books that cannot be topped. I can think of five IMO. This is one of them. I also highly HIGHLY recommend that people read \\"Flesh and the Devil\\" by Kola Boof, a true unsung African classic that is equal to this book IMO. Loved Achebe!
B00006JU7T|5.0|Serpico came out in 1973 right around the time Al Pacino was at his best, and every film he made was not only a classic, but also had a performance from him that earned an Oscar nod. Coming out right after the Godfather, this is the film that was all about Al, though the Godfather is a timeless classic it is often looked at as Brando's movie, while Serpico gave Al the chance to shine and demonstrate just how talented he was as a lead actor. The script is a fantastic adaptation of the book of the same name and Sidney Lumet does an incredible job, proving himself as one of those great directors that continues to do brilliant work throughout multiple decades. It's the story of a man, isolated by his co-workers because of his morals and intolerance to corruption, the abuse he endures because of it and his prevalence through any obstacle that gets in the way. It is a moving character study that can only be accomplished this well by an actor with incredible talent. Classic 70's cinema from a legendary actor and director.
B000MQC9H4|5.0|Romantic comedies have the unfortunate habit of being formulaic to the point of being boring. Not so with The Holiday. There is some formula here, however, or it wouldn't be a romantic comedy.  The casting is superb: Kate Winslet, Cameron Diaz, Jack Black, Jude Law, Rufus Sewell, and Eli Wallach. The acting is top notch, and I don't often find myself thinking that about Cameron Diaz or Jack Black (sorry!) Perhaps it's the outstanding script and direction of Nancy Meyers that brings out the best in everyone. Maybe this cast just happens to have the right chemistry together. Ultimately, it doesn't matter why. What matters is that this is one fantastic movie. Believable characters, believable situations, and the right dash of hope, feel-good optimism, and light-hearted humor that can really make a romantic comedy not just good, but great!  Even the score seems perfect. It adds just enough to each scene, but never too much.   Lest you think it's strictly a chick flick. My husband watched it with me once and said \\"I can see why you like this movie so much, it's a good film.\\"
B003O86FMW|5.0|This was by far the best book of the Hunger Games Trilogy.  You have at least gotten to know the characters and feel for them, and it is before they completely drain the life out of you with Mockingjay.  This was a really good read and an excellent complement to the first book.
B003P2WO5E|2.0|I've read the other reviews and concluded the reviewers were paid to comment.  I'm a fan and was looking forward to this book; pre-ordered it, in fact.    I'm a prolific reader, and put this one aside and haven't looked at it for 3 days, which is almost unheard-of.  I'm about a quarter of the way through it and it's heavy plodding.  I just can't get \\"into\\" it.  If I don't really care what happens to anyone and don't get into the premise after 250 pages, something is wrong.  I gave it two stars just because it didn't seem fair to give it one when I haven't finished it.  I'm not sure I'll ever go back and finish it.  It didn't help that I read The Black Prism by Weeks the day before; that book was Killer and and it set the bar pretty high...  I'm not usually harsh on books I read and I rarely leave reviews, but frankly, this is going to the \\"Archive\\" bin on my Kindle.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|This book was a good read overall, but the premise of the story is very hectic and then very draining.  I may just be the type of person that really does want at least a semi-happy ending when a series is over, especially when I \\"think\\" I have grown to like the characters as much as I did, but I am not sure if this book really ended happily at all.  I don't want to be a spolier, so I won't say what happened, but I guess some more of the charaters would have lived to see the end of the book, and one's that did live would have died, if I had actually written this.  But alas, I did not write this book. And so, there was a lot of unhappiness that ended this trilogy that left me more saddened than satisified.  I have to say that the writing is gripping, I read the entire book in a day, and really could not put it down, but when I finally did, I was a bit disappointed and very sad.
0316098337|4.0|...and I fell under its spell even though I hate most bestselling fiction.  It's not that I couldn't put it down--I couldn't--but that I couldn't even SIT down while I was reading it.  I read most of it standing up in the kitchen while vaguely pretending to do chores.    Does anyone know who's optioned it?  It could be an amazing movie.
B001AQO3QA|2.0|I understand they are just trying to make the Alien movies available on blu ray, and that's good! Problem: the release is terrible! As many reviewers have said before me; everyone already owns these movies! What they should have done is release them individually on blu ray and for a much lower price. Thanks to the multiple re-releases on DVD many people only bought the first two because really, let's be honest, they are the only good ones in the franchise. And the price, as others have mentioned, is ridiculous. Yes blu ray is more expensive than DVD (generally speaking) but we can't forget that when the Alien Quadrilogy first came out its price nearly matched this one! And speaking of the Alien Quadrilogy ; anyone who already owns it such as myself will see that other than being blu ray format, this collection is the EXACT same (despite very minor things)! So to sum up: you only need to buy this if you are a fan of ALL the Alien movies, do NOT already own them in another format and are willing to pay 100 dollars plus. So there you have it consumers, the choice is yours.
0439023513|5.0|An author's life is a difficult one. But now I see a successful author's life can be almost an impossible one. Too much romance and there's instant comparison to Twilight. Too little romance and we say the story is depressing. Too much presto magic and we say the story's unrealistic. Where is the happy medium? These observations are what led me to post this blurb about the latest installment of the Hunger Games trilogy, Mockingjay.<br /><br />The author set out to accomplish what she intended to do in the series. Period. There's no fluff. No over the top romance. No gimmicks. No holds barred. We all knew when we opened the book that what we were about to experience wouldn't be nice or gushy. This isn't romance, fantasy, or zombie land. The people are real. Circumstances resulting from a world at war are perhaps too realistic. Maybe that's why so many feel as if Collins failed her readers. I do not feel that way. As I plowed through the book, I didn't skim as I have done so many novels these days. I took my time. As a person who has not lost a loved one to war, but know plenty of people who have, I feel I've pretty much lived in a bubble compared to what the characters experienced in this novel. By the end, I was...enlightened.<br /><br />Having read all three novels, I thought this one was the saddest, but also the most true to purpose one of the series. Maybe I'm alone in this thinking, but I thought Katniss' love for Peeta matured in this novel more than the other two. True, they were apart and not slobbering all over each other every other sentence. But isn't that what wives of soldiers at war experience all the time? Love for someone thousands of miles away? Someone they have to watch over a video screen, or even worse, see tortured by the enemy while they can do nothing but watch? Remember, love is emotional as well as physical. So in a sense, the author succeeded in portraying the perils of love in war. The romance is still there. You just have to be willing to see how it affects Katniss in an entirely original light.<br /><br />I like that Collins didn't leave dangly questions carried over from the last novels. Even small things were answered. And for a meticulous reader like me, that means more than an ending cooked up to satisfy...well, me. Even though I found myself sitting at work teary eyed. Was a bit upset the meat of a good subplot happened in the epilogue. And hope that someday, we might get to see a companion novel that details the years in between the ending and epilogue, I'm still satisfied. Maybe it didn't end the way we wanted it to. But perhaps it ended in a way we needed to see. Five Stars!!!ffects Katniss in an entirely original light.     I like that Collins didn't leave dangly questions carried over from the last novels.

0439023513|5.0|I enjoyed this series and it gave me something I haven't found in books for awhile.  Some escapism, some caring for the characters and something to think about.  It is a very dark subject, I think it was handled well and with emphathy.
0439023513|2.0|I also loved the first two books. Read them and listened to both on CD with husband on roadtrips. I was so excited about this book and began reading it on my kindle. I kept thinking \\"this is slow, but it'll pick up.\\" Then I realized that my kindle was telling me that I was 56% through the book, then 80% through the book, then even 94% through the book. And when it finally did pick up, the cleverness in creating a believable yet fascinating outcome was just not there. Where did the author go? What happened? How is the book getting such stellar reviews? Aren't the other lovers of this series just as disappointed as I am or did I somehow download the wrong book with the same characters? The book barely gets going and when it does it's so unbelievable. And the love triangle? Are you kidding me? This book made me dislike all three characters. I didn't care who ended up with who by the end. It was so poorly addressed and resolved that it's almost like someone else wrote this book. The author in the first two books loved her characters. The author of this book was just trying to come up with something quickly, wrote it down and sent it to press. I am thoroughly disappointed that this series ended with this book. I wish the author could do a re-write.
B0039TD7PY|5.0|I was so pleased to receive this item at warp speed, and it's perfect!  A+  Totally happy.
0765326353|2.0|This book was boring beyond belief. As the first in a planned 10 book sequence, this book should reach out, grab you and never let you go. Instead it was paced as if it was written as a student exercise in world building. Additionally, the characters are flat, wooden, 1 dimensional, and often mind-numbingly stupid. I could go on, but frankly, I have wasted too much time on this book already.
0765326353|5.0|So, I am an avid reader.  I am usually very good about taking time to balance my reading with work/family/play.   This book ruined that balance, after 2 days of locking myself in my room and coming home from work early, my schedule may return to normal, if i don't decide to reread the thing to find things i have missed.  Overall i thought this was an amazing book, the best being the potential of things to come.  Brandon Sanderson is able to create original, believable worlds/systems/cultures.  Don't believe the bad reviews.  BUY THIS BOOK!
0439023513|5.0|I waited a year for this book, and it was soo worth it.. it was incredible.
B0039NJTLQ|4.0|Despite the fact that Jake and Natalie are listed as the stars, their roles really are not as haunting as the role Tobey plays. The quasi romance between Tommy (Jake) and Grace (Natalie) only amounted to slow flirtation. This storyline would have more depth if there were a real relationship formed when Sam (Tobey) was rescued from Afghanistan. Indeed, the story of Sam's ordeal and subsequent torment provides all the driving intensity in this movie. Tobey does a good job in portraying a psychological damaged individual. In the climax, Sam finally blows up emotionally over the perceived betrayal by his brother Tommy and his wife Grace, but underneath, the cause for his breakdown is his own guilt over his action towards a brother of war in Afghanistan. In some ways, the Tommy and Grace story, rather light and enjoyable, is like a sugar coat around the bitter theme of the price of war.
0316017922|3.0|This was a required book for my college English Lit class. It was an easy read and doing a report on it was also easy. However, after the opening hook, it relies on anecdotes and junk science. Read it for fun, and its few thought provoking moments. But if you are a parent, don't use this as a gauge for Little Johnny or Jane's future because they weren't born in the right time or at the right place. It's good for an A in an English class, but that's about all.

B003A4IFGY|3.0|This was not the album the hype led me to expect.  I had heard this was going to be primarily a rocking blues album that would capture the electricity of Petty and the Heartbreakers' live performance jams.  I'm a huge Mike Campbell fan, so was really looking forward to this release with the Heartbreakers at full tilt.  Too bad.  There are a couple of great kick-ass rockers on it, but if you saw TPH's recent SNL gig, you've already heard the best of the album.  Most of the other cuts are pretty dull folk-rock.  Breaks my heart but not in a good way.

0785134352|5.0|I loved it. It got me into comics and now I'm buying every week. Just amazing very funny and bloody I suggest it if you're getting tired of no blood. Not for kids unless you're a bad parent or you trust them.
0439023513|2.0|I always feel bad, writing a review for a book I think is less than exceptional, but I just can't hold in the disappointment I feel for this one. In general, the ending didn't bother me, cause I thought it seemed very \\"real.\\" However, how it lead to the ending - the way the story was told - kinda shocked me. The characters in the book were incredibly flat (\\"Where was the dialog???\\") completely unlike the first two books. To me, they were never fleshed out even in the remotest sense. I never laughed with them, I never cried with them or got angry with/at them! It just kind of told the story and \\"The End.\\" A lot of things happened, but they were described AFTER the fact instead of during. What took me hours to finish with the last two books, took me a week with this one. I just couldn't connect with the characters and that's the biggest part of reading for me. Unfortunately, I just didn't like it. I had very high expectation and this book just didn't cut it. Sorry, Miss Collins. :(
B002N5N5LG|5.0|I'm a huge 30 Rock and Arrested Development fan, but having just made it through Season 1 of Community, it's my new favorite, by far.  I'm even now finding myself watching the season a second time through -  the last few episodes of the show were particularly awesome, especially \\"Modern Warfare.\\" Whoever was in charge of nominating at the Emmys were idiots not to have picked this show for Best Comedy! Abed and Senor Chang are two of the best characters on TV, while Joel McHale ties everything together to make the show as awesome as it is.

B001VNB54A|3.0|Band of Brothers was one of the greatest shows on TV so naturally, when HBO announced the Pacific (the other theater of operation), I was looking forward to it.    Here it is in a nutshell.  BOB: 5 stars. Pacific 3.5 stars.  The biggest difference in the two series was that with BOB, the focus did not waver from Easy Company.  That allowed me to build a connection with the characters in BOB.  With the Pacific, the actual war was a scattered island-to-island, frog on a lillypad operation.  Combined that with three different protagonists, I found the storyline and the characters too scattered.  I wanted to like the Pacific a lot but the magic of BOB wasn't there for this series.      On its own merit, it is a very good series and a must watch for any history/war movie buffs.    By the way, I don't get the negative reviews from others who apparently see the Pacific as a liberal/leftist attack on American military honor.  I have no idea why you would see it that way.  War is hell.  Atrocities are committed on both sides.  It just so happened that the Japanese perspective was not represented.  There is one memorable scene where one of the \\"less compassionate\\" US marine is tossing debris into a pool of blood that accumulated in a Japanese soldier's half destroyed cranium.  Having watched that scene, I certainly did not think that \\"boy, those US marines were savages\\".  What I sensed from that scene was how the chaos and the destruction of war also destroy one's humanity (not just Americans or Japanese).    Apparently tea party activism is rearing its head in Amazon reviews now.
B000002OX7|5.0|Regarded for many (including myself) as the most inspiring album in their impressive career, this album showed the world the multiple possibilities of expression and creative turn they gave his music.<br /><br />Plenty of vitality, driving force and overwhelming flair, this album in the days of the extinct format LP captured the whole attention. And it was an impressive success in 1971, one of the most memorable years of the decade, given the appearance of bands who actually are part of the legend, like Led Zepellin (who captivated the world with his IV album), the consecrated Deep Purple (with his terrific albums Made in Japan, Highway star), Uriah Heep, Yes, Captain beyond, Emerson Lake and Palmer,  Cactus, Gentle giant,  Mountain, Nazareth among other not least legendaries bands.<br /><br />It's hard to believe in those days, but I give you my word about won't get fooled again was my favorite choice. And the pleasant surprise to have achieved the 17th place as the best Rock theme at the end of the century.<br /><br />This is, neither more nor less, one of the most transcendental albums of the Rock & Roll ever made. So, don't think it over and go for it.
B000001GRZ|5.0|i'm not a cellist, just a long time devoted classical music enthusiast.  i own 5 versions of the bach cello suites that are all excellent and well-loved: ma, rostropovich, harrell, starker and fournier.  i rarely listen to ma's version because after a while the suites start sounding the same; the exaggerated pianissimos are not always welcome, especially for the baroque style.  rostropovich's version is bouncy, lively, technically-assured, and authoritative (i'd say \\"imperious\\", reminiscent of his russian colleague, sviatoslav richter, in that same style); but like ma, there's a certain \\"same-ness\\", particularly of tone, in almost every piece.  i've always admired the deep, rich and masculine sound of harrell.  but he doesn't quite get the point in some of these pieces, often passing off some notes that need emphasis, resulting in plenty of \\"missed opportunities\\". this surprised me because he was amazing with the rachmaninov cello sonata (accompanied by ashkenazy) [[ASIN:B00000E2Y0 Rachmaninov: Sonata for Cello & Piano, Op. 19 / Vocalise, Op. 34:14, etc.]]. perhaps he does better with romantic than baroque?<br />now comes the really tough competition: starker versus fournier?  i grew up with starker's version and for decades found it definitive, despite his loud breathing being very apparent.  but when i came across fournier's version (i saw it in a second hand store and immediately bought it since, to this day, his dvorak cello concerto with szell [[ASIN:B000001GBX Dvor&aacute;k: Cello Concerto; Bruch: Kol Nidrei; Bloch: Schelomo]], imho, remains unsurpassed) i fell in love with it.  i read some reviewers say \\"lack of confidence\\", \\"too solemn\\", \\"lacking in humor\\".  i suppose the enjoyment of music is subjective and one's favorite is whatever gives one the most pleasure.  in my mind, i will always describe fournier's interpretation as having the most concentration and analysis, infused with his distinctive personality.  he thought out every piece carefully and colored them (not in an exaggerated manner like some did) as if they were songs that can be hummed.  one reviewer even suspected mike positioning to create the sound he wanted on some pieces.  i suspect he intentionally de-emhasized some notes (playing them softer) to emphasize the main melody line.  it's that singing line, for me, that makes music musical.  and the timbre...oh what a timbre! i'm sure this has to do with the way he bows the strings that cellists here can hash out among themselves.  fournier's will be one of my desert island CDs that I will never part with; but i won't part with starker's either.m (not in an exaggerated manner like some did) as if they were songs that can be hummed.  one reviewer even suspected mike positioning to create the sound he wanted on some pieces.  i suspect he intentionally de-emhasized some notes (playing them softer) to emphasize the main melody line.  it's that singing line, for me, that makes music musical.  and the timbre...oh what a timbre! i'm sure this has to do with the way he bows the strings that cellists here can hash out among themselves.  fournier's will be one of my desert island CDs that I will never part with; but i won't part with starker's either.
B003S897U0|5.0|this album is great and unexpensive. the album is so good that only the first few songs already pay for it, and throughout the album you will constantly get this feeling that some few songs make the whole album worth the cost and the rest of the set is just a wonderful gift, that good is this album. i own all the studio records and plenty of instant live cds, so when i purchased this album, i really was not expecting to get anything i have not heard before. big was my surprise when i realized that these versions of their old songs were totally different, to the point it almost felt like their were new tracks. These recordings were not only significantly distinct but better versions of the studio and live ones. I am so confident of the validity of this statement (that these are superior versions of their old songs), that I will consider this album as the perfect way to introduce the black crowes to people that have never listened to them before.
0817439390|5.0|I have several of his books and they are all top notch.  However, this one helped me understand how to take pictures in the Manual mode with good results and I am now in charge.  There is much, much more valuable information in it. As with all his books, you will refer to it regularly until you get the hang of what you are learning to do. I recommend it highly.

The clear case fits perfectly and has a clip on the back so you can clip it on your waistband if you want to instead of using the armband.  The armband is good quality and looks great too.

B003L77TZI|4.0|I regard TEENAGE DREAM as a guilty pleasure; I think Katy herself has a irritating personality and her vocal abilities are somewhat limited, so she needs slick production [Max Martin, Dr. Luke, Benny Blanco, Rico Love, Greg Wells, Tricky Stewart, Stargate] to boost it.<br /><br />But she does make up for this with a solid song-writing talent; She has co-wrote every track on TEENAGE DREAM, while guest writers include the likes of Lukasz Gottwald, Max Martin, Bonnie McKee, Benjamin Levin, Calvin Broadus and Greg Wells.<br /><br />Katy herself admitted to not wanting to alienate her existing fanbase by changing her sound, so it's good news for 'One Of The Boys' lovers, however I was not wowed by that album so was unsure about getting this. What changed my mind was the fact that she released three promotion singles [Not Like The Movies, Circle The Drain and E.T.] on US Itunes in the run up to the album's release and I loved those, and if the label released those early then they must be saving the best tracks for the official release, right?<br /><br />Wrong. The promotional tracks and the already released singles are by far the best things that the album has to offer. To be blunt; There isn't one new song that instantly strikes me as solid single worthy material. 'Firework' is rumoured to be the third single - all I can say to that is thank God the album was released first.<br /><br />But it's not all bad news; Out of the remaining seven tracks there's only one track [Peacock] that I instantly took a dislike to, and since it's one of those songs that gets stuck in your head, I still sneakily listen to it. In fact: There's only two songs out of the twelve that I skip, and whilst the remaining songs are too samey to the stronger tracks, I wouldn't call them bad.<br /><br />At the end of the day I consider TEENAGE DREAM to be a solid album and find it much stronger than 'One Of The Boys'.<br /><br />Oh; The CD is scented with a candy floss fragrance. Cute.<br /><br />- - - - - - - -<br />Tracklist<br />- - - - - - - -<br /><br />1. Teenage Dream<br /><br />This is the type of song I term as a 'grower'. The simple, guitar lead music does nothing for me and Katy's vocals are a bit screechy at the start, but I love the lyrical content; Her love for Russell Brand is equal to to the dizzying rush of your first love. The lyrics tell a story, as opposed to being empty and emotionless noise.<br /><br />2. Last Friday Night (T.G.I.F.)<br /><br />Katy tells us about her booze and funfilled Friday night, which features a menage a trois.<br /><br />She sticks to the guitar lead, pop/rock music from her 'One Of The Boys' era. The lyrics are simple and cheerful, good but not memorable. I can see this as a single though, as it's very radio friendly.<br /><br />3. California Gurls (feat. Snoop Dogg)<br /><br />Katy's number 1 smash.<br /><br />This is pure, electro-tinged pop, that is a dedication to - bet you never saw this coming - California's female population. When I sit here trying to break the song down to review it I can't find anything valid to say about it; It's success is do to it having simple lyrics that get stuck in your head.<br /><br />4. Firework<br /><br />This is another 'One Of The Boys' throwback, with light synths and lyrics that are upbeat and are quite shouty.<br /><br />It's meant to be inspiring as she encourages someone to \\"ignite the light and let it shine\\". There's nothing about I instantly dislike, but neither the music nor lyrics has a hook to them, so I don't find this memorable.<br /><br />5. Peacock<br /><br />I find this similar to 'California Gurls' in that the music is electro-tinged rock/pop and the lyrics are simple and get annoyingly stuck in my head.<br />The whole thing is basically Katy asking to see a guy's \\"Peacock\\" [wink, wink], I think this is meant to be humorous but I just find it childish.<br /><br />Oh; The spoken verse is amazingly embarrassing \\"Oh my God no exaggeration, boy all this time was worth the waiting, I just shed a tear, I am so unprepared, You've got the finest architecture, End of the rainbow lookin' treasure, such a sight to see, And it's all for me\\".<br /><br />6. Circle The Drain<br /><br />This track tells us the story of how Katy's ex-fiance's drug addition eroded their relationship, to the point where she had to leave as she couldn't bear to stick around and watch him self-destruct and \\"circle the drain\\".<br /><br />The rockier music really suits her somewhat shouty vocals and is a bit different to the other tracks, so I loved it at first and was tempted to call it the standout track on the album, however the line of the bridge where she informs us that Travis \\"Fell asleep during foreplay\\" is a low blow against a man struggling with a serious addiction and I find it somewhat distasteful.<br /><br />7. The One That Got Away<br /><br />We once again return to classic Katy Perry with pop/rock music [this time it's drum lead, rather then guitar lead for a change] and lyrics that tell a story: This time about a teenage love that fizzled out.<br /><br />I think the track's style is very similar to 'Teenage Dream', but it falls slightly short of the mark for me. A track I skip over.<br /><br />8. E.T.<br /><br />This is Peacock: Part II. Another electro favoured track, which once again contains cringe-worthy lyrics, this time dedicated to what a great lover Russell Brand is. I'm not sure how saying your lover is like a alien is supposed to be sensual, but I love the music so this is probably the track I've played the most.<br /><br />9. Who Am I Living For?<br /><br />Another soft-sync production which raise my opinion of the track. I think the lyrics are about Katy finding self-confidence and strength in dealing with her increasingly public life. Or war.<br /><br />The style is a nice fit for her vocals, but the meaning of the lyrics isn't clear for me, so it becomes empty noise.<br /><br />10. Pearl<br /><br />Katy says this is her favourite track on the album.<br /><br />This again has a slick soft-synchs and lyrics that aren't clear to me. The song is about how a woman who used to be strong has now become stuck. Stuck by what or who. Is it someone Katy knows in her personal life or is it a public figure?<br /><br />Placing it next to 'Who Am I Living For' is a mistake. It's too samey. Another skipper.<br /><br />11. Hummingbird Heartbeat<br /><br />Sticking to the same classic Katy music as heard in 'Teenage Dream' and 'The One That Got Away', she uses lyrics about love that sounds like the before mentioned songs. I've not got anything to say about this; It's just OK - I don't skip it, but it's not memorable.<br /><br />12. Not Like The Movies<br /><br />This track details how she accepted her ex' marriage proposal, even though she had doubts right from the start; After all it didn't feel the way the movies depict it.<br /><br />Katy's vocals aren't really suited to ballad type tracks, but the strong lyrical content, paired with the pared down piano driven music make this a standout track.all for me\\".      6.

B002UXRGM0|5.0|If you liked Planet Earth, you'll like (this version of) Life.  It's more amazing HD video and wonderful David Attenborough narration from the BBC Earth team.  This time the Blu-ray version gets some behind-the-scenes love with a short segment following each episode.    If you've read any Life reviews on Amazon, you'll find you can get the series narrated by Attenborough or Oprah.  I haven't heard the Oprah naration, but it's easy to believe that this is the version you want.
0439023513|3.0|I read all three books last weekend and I really enjoyed the first two. The stories were well written and charachters were compelling  At the end of the Hunger Games and Catching Fire I was on the edge of my seat really wanting to know what was going to happen next. Then Mockingjay comes along, again the story was compelling. Most of the way through I enjoyed it. But I was unsatisfied with lack of depth in the relationship between Peeta and Katniss. Where did the love go? I would have enjoyed it more if Suzanne Collins had fleshed out their relationship after Peeta recovered. It left me feeling like something essential to the story was missing. And the epilogue...instead of us getting a glimpse of a happy future (hate to compare the two, but remember the Deathly Hallows ending???? Now that was an epilogue!) we are left with a picture of Katniss many years in the future but her bleak outlook never changes! I would read these again, but I would still miss the love story...
0439023513|1.0|Allow me to preface this by saying that I thoroughly enjoyed Hunger Games, and that I thought Catching Fire was downright fantastic.  Mockingjay, on the other hand, was a farce.  It was almost as if Collins became bored with the world she had created, and decided to focus on the contrived love triangle.  The only times Katniss gets into the action it's because she says, \\"Oh, I think I'll go there.\\"  There's no reason for it, other than Collins deciding to move the plot forward when she can't possibly do it within the confines of District 13.    SPOILER ALERT!    Seriously, you've been warned, I'm about to ruin the ending.    Okay, the ending is the WORST part of the book.  It may be the worst ending in any series I've ever liked, and it was certainly the most let-down I've ever been by any book.  Katniss goes to assassinate Snow, although, really, there's no point for it.  There comes a time when she is separated from both Gale and Peeta, and Collins's aversion to describing war and desire to going back to her ridiculous love triangle shines through.  She LITERALLY ends the book with a bang - Katniss has essentially been worthless for the second half of the book.  As soon as the explosion happens, Katniss catches on fire, and Collins bridges the most important part of the book with a paragraph saying \\"The rebels won, blah blah blah, back to the love triangle.\\"  I've been seriously contemplating simply cutting out that paragraph and adding it to the end of Catching Fire.  If I ever do read this series again, it'll be the first two books, and that paragraph from Mockingjay (because the rest of the book TRULY did not matter.)    END SPOILERS    Why Suzanne?  Why?  You created an amazing dystopia for young adults - I was riveted!  Mockingjay felt like you were saying \\"The dystopian elements aren't important, the political elements aren't important, any characters that aren't involved in a love triangle with Katniss aren't important.  I'm bored with the world I created,and I simply want to focus on Katniss's teen angst.\\"  If you want to recall Mockingjay and write it over, I'll be the first to send you my copy.

B0031OCY2E|2.0|This is one of the most boring, pointless and sleep inducing films I have seen in a long time.  I watched it with a friend and we kept waiting for the plot to develop or for something to happen.  Matt Damon is one of my favorite actors but i wanted to ask him to go away and take his movie with him.  If there was a plot and point to this movie, We missed it.  Hope he has some other films in the works for the future or its back to Hot Dogs and Baked Beans for awhile.

0739384198|1.0|I'd like to preface this review by saying if this wasn't being posted online It would be laced with profanity to accurately express the depth of my disappointment with this book. It's (insert expletive here) really awful! I struggled through The GIRL WITH THE DRAGON TATTOO. I thought the GIRL WHO PLAYED WITH FIRE was better and had hoped that the GIRL WHO KICKED THE HORNET'S NEST would be the best of the three. I thought there was something wrong with me because millions of people LOVED this series. I think that once something has become the \\"Talk of the town\\" people are too embarrassed to admit publicly that they don't like it. These books are so poorly written it makes Dan Brown seem like Proust. Such a profound waste of time. If you are looking for a modern classic try The Help or Water for Elephants.
B00005N6KG|3.0|I was using a pair of Sennheiser PX100's when mowing or at the gym for the past 5 years, until suddenly one side stopped working. Now they cost much more than I paid then (about 38), and even the new PX100-II's are a little pricey. Comparing those to these Sony's here's the differences:    Sony's cord is about 8\\" shorter. One side gets tugged on a little if I put my MP3 player in  my sweats pocket.    Sony's are very workout friendly otherwise. Sweat wipes off easily when done (the PX100  s I had to blot the ear cushions).    These lack bass. There are parts of songs that I'm used to hearing that these don't even hint at in the bass region. Definitely an \\"airy\\" sound.     These are extremely comfortable and stay in place. They don't let sweat pool like the over the ear type did, and they don't shift. And best of all they feel like there's nothing at all on my head.    I paid 8 for these, shipped. Not bad, although I do miss the cord length and bass. Makes me wonder if I should've gone with the MDR-W24V headset. IF anyone has compared these two, let me know your thoughts. I really like the vertical style now; if only I could find some that get down to at least 40Hz and have a 4' cord.
B00127RAJY|4.0|I love 30 day shred. Really, a lot. I love that the workouts are only twenty-minutes and that they get results. My main problem with this DVD is that you are unable to fast forward from Jillian's introduction. So, if they make future editions of this DVD they should make it so we are able to not have to listen to Jillian's introduction a million times. Other than that I love the product.
B003JTHETY|5.0|Impressive! majestic!Breathtaking! I am truly satisfied with their latest album \\"the Final Frontier\\". I have been an iron maiden fan for more than 10 years and this is one of their most strongest album for this decade.Most of the songs are captivating and the more you listen to them the more you like them.Fully recommended!

I have tried 3 different DVD players and continually get a message that it is not authorized to play in our region...apparently it is a UK DVD.  The seller should list that in the description, but I can't find it anywhere. Of course when I went to the reviews I found that other buyers had the same problem. What a rip off.

It's not for under 17 yr olds, but for us former Bikers, I found it refreshing. Kate Segal (Peggy from \\"married with Children\\", is a complete turn-a-round, illustrateing her Best role as the Matriarch of the Bikers Creed and Honor.    Ron Perlman, excellant acting, and convincing. His stepson is the main character in the series. The film is violent, sexual content, and compassion..its worth enjoying with a open mind..That I promise you!!
B003O85W44|2.0|I absolutely loved Funeral. That album has been in rotation since I bought it. I never grow tired of hearing Neighborhood 1. I purchased The Neon Bible with the great hope that the album would be nearly as good as the one that preceded it, but I found myself growing tired of it very quickly. Here it is, a few years later, and I rarely listen to a single song off of that album. I was hoping it was just the difficulty bands sometimes face when creating a masterpiece and then having to follow that album with one that, while rarely is as a good as it's older sibling, can at least can stand on its own.<br /><br />The latest album from Arcade Fire is starting to make me think they are the M. Night Shyamalan of the music world; each new release is more and more disappointing. I try to give them the benefit of repeated listenings but each time I get less and less from The Suburbs. I hope that maybe it'll grow on me, but I have little hope for such luck. Borrow it from a friend before you buy it.
B002XTBE6K|5.0|This is a magnificent production. Those who makes comments on these pages that Romola Garai does not live up to the role and that others in the cast, such as Michael Gambon, are inadequate are utter fools. Garai is stunning and a superbly nuanced actress and gives a bravura performance. Gambon is a sweet and dear Mr. Woodhouse who is subtly hilarious. Having not read the book in a few years I can not speak to the scene to scene (in)consistencies in the novel vs. screenplay, but this adaptation stands strong on its' own merit. Garai, on whom the whole production centers, as it should, is a far superior actress to Paltrow. And the older productions do not even belong in the conversation.
0439023513|5.0|I loved The Hunger Games, and I thought Catching Fire was a good follow-up.  Mockingjay might be the best of the three.  The playing field is wide open now - we're not going to have another Hunger Games to dictate the story line.  We get war, more Gale, and yes, a lot of dark material.  We also get some great character development.  I love the way Katniss is constantly strategizing, analyzing the people around her, but all the while trying to maintain an high sense of morality and ethics in impossible situations.  She has a wonderful sense of honor during war.  You might go into the book thinking it's going to be largely about which guy she's going to pick in the end, but it's ultimately a story about survival against all odds, with honor intact.
0374158460|5.0|Like many of you, perhaps, I was a bit turned off by all the advance hype surrounding this book.  Many have called it a masterpiece, even Book of the Century.      I wouldn't go that far--but it is certainly an excellent novel which succeeds on several levels.  It is literary, yet it is blockbuster stuff in its commercial connotations, with lots of sex and topical concerns.  A novel for our times, yet one which resonates with the classics.    The first section is a very comfortable read. For a time, it seemed almost a parody or tribute to Garrison Keillor's monologues about Lake Woebegone, such as collected in his volume, LIBERTY.  It opens in Minnesota too, but instead of a rural neighborhood, this is the suburbs, and the narrative seemingly turns onto the set of Wisteria Lane in DESPERATE HOUSEWIVES.    Still, the first section, entitled \\"Good Neighbors,\\" is an entertaining satire, nicely paced and well sprinkled with insights about archetypical types. I especially enjoyed the conspiratorial tone.    The next section is an autobiography of one of the main characters written in the third person with editorial asides.  This sets the out the main characters and the plot for the novel, though the novel has already been succinctly foreshadowed in the lone epigraph:    Go, together  You precious winners all. I, an old turtle,  Will wing me to some withered bough, and there  My mate, that's never to be found again,  Lament till I am lost. --Shakespeare, THE WINTER'S TALE    As I say, much of the novel is about winners and losers, freedom vs. responsibility. Franzen sets up a trinity of main characters, Patti and her husband Walter as suburban Adam and Eve, and Adam's friend, Richard, as the snake in the Garden.    This trinity consists of Walter (mind/spirit dominated), Richard (flesh dominated), and wishy-washy Patti, who wants to have both and wavers between the two.    About midway through the book, Lilitha is introduced.  Make no mistake, she is an incarnation of Lilith from the Garden of Eden Myth, a mirror to Richard, with a Lilith agenda against population growth, babies--and childbirth in principle.    Franzen uses literary and musical references to support his arguments (and much of the novel seems argued). Regarding winners and losers, he mentions Bob Dylan's showing up Donovan in the documentary, \\"Don't Look Back.\\" He shows Richard reading his favorite new novelist, Thomas Bernhard, but doesn't tell us which book he is reading.    Of course, if you've read Thomas Bernhard's THE LOSER, you would know which book it was, for that is the world in which Richard would find himself at home.    And Patti reads WAR AND PEACE, skimming over the military parts to get to Tolstoy's soap-opera sections, which resonate well with this novel.  The text mentions WAR AND PEACE several times as if justify its own use of melodrama--see, the classics used soap too.     Other classical references are mentioned: Aristotle and the different kinds of causes: Material, efficient, formal, and final.  Walter sees the final cause of most of the world's problems as unlimited population growth, which aligns him with Lilith.    Richard is a counter-culture rock musician who finally becomes successful after souring on the business, as can be seen in an interview after a Grammy nomination. Note the reference to Rousseau:    \\"Q: What do you think of the MP3 revolution?    A: Ah, revolution, wow. It's great to hear the word \\"revolution\\" again. It's great that a song now costs exactly the same as a pack of gum and lasts exactly the same amount of time before it loses its flavor and you have to spend another buck.    That era which finally ended but yesterday, whenever--you know, that era when we pretended rock was the scourge of conformity and consumerism, instead of its anointed handmaid--that era was really irritating to me. I think it's good for the honesty of rock and roll and good for the country in general that we can finally see Bob Dylan and Iggy Popfor what they really were: as manufacturers of winter-green Chiclets.    Q: So you're saying rock has lost its subversive edge?    A: I'm saying it never had any subversive edge. It was always wintergreen Chiclets, we just enjoyed pretending otherwise.    Q: What about when Dylan went electric?    A: If you're going to talk about ancient history, let's go back to the French revolution. Remember when, I forget his name, but that rocker who wrote \\"Marseillaise, Jean Jacques Whoever--remember when his song started getting all that airplay in 1792, and suddenly the peasantry rose up and overthrew the aristocracy? There was a song that changed the world.    Attitude was what the peasants were missing. They already had everything else--humiliating servitude, grinding poverty, unpayable debts, horrific working conditions. But without a song, man, it added up to nothing. The sansculotte style was what really changed the world.    ...We in the Chiclet manufacturing business are not about social justice, we're not about accurate or objectively verifiable information, we're not about meaningful labor, we're not about a coherent set of national ideals, we're not about wisdom. . .\\"    After finishing the book, you'll have to ask yourself, is this book brilliant and profound or is it just another box of wintergreen Chiclets?    Seems to me, the correct answer is: both.
B00030DEQE|5.0|My integrated port on the motherboard stopped working and nothing I could do would fix it, so I sprang for this for one of my slots. Have to say it works very well out of the box (using Ubuntu 10.4 and Windows 7). Not sure if it is my imagination, but it actually seems to run faster and give me less problems than my old one, but then again the old one (integrated) died, so perhaps it was always acting a bit odd. Either way, for the price I think it's very well worth it.
B003X73QA8|3.0|Arcade Fire was not an \\"instant get it\\" for me. I initially found both Neon Bible and Funerals overwrought, over-arranged, and sonically muddy. But they have long since both worked their way into my permanent playlist, and my listening world would be poorer without them.    So it was natural that I would give The Suburbs plenty of listening time before coming to a conclusion. Especially since many of my favorite albums of the past year, like New Pornographers' Together, took repeated listening to appreciate.     But no, time has not helped. There is little of the rhythmic and vocal urgency that made their earlier work such a delight, and the problematic mixing has gotten worse.     Sigh. Disappointed.

1843118416|5.0|[[VIDEOID:moVU5DODFNWQ2I]]CONCERNING PLACES OF REFUGE FOR SHIPS IN DISTRESS<br /><br />An appreciation by Phillip Taylor MBE and Elizabeth Taylor of Richmond Green Chambers<br /><br />If you're professionally involved in the world of shipping, transport and maritime law, whether practitioner, student or academic, you need this invaluable work of reference from Lloyd's List.  It addresses one of the thorniest and most topical issues pertaining to worldwide shipping:  the problem of what to do about - and where to put - a vessel foundering in distress off a coastline.  Certainly this is a matter that has confounded national and city states since the early days of sail.<br /><br />Significantly in the opening pages, the author quotes Pliny the Younger (who [we believe] chronicled the eruption of Vesuvius in AD 71!) who applauds the construction of a port on the Italian coast (now Citta Vechia) as a safe haven that would save countless lives. Just goes to show how long -- and longer -- the problem has been with us and which, almost two millennia later has acquired new and often horrifying dimensions, due to security issues and the risk of environmental pollution.<br /><br />It is the reluctance of many coastal states to agree to -- and adhere to -- specific legal arrangements for governing ships in distress which persists as a vexed issue worldwide and which the CMI (Comite Maritime International) has sought to address in the form of the CMI draft Instrument.<br /><br />It's the author, Professor Eric Van Hooydonk, who presented a paper at the 2004 Vancouver Conference entitled `The obligation to offer a place of refuge to a ship in distress. A plea for granting a salvage reward to ports and an international convention on ports of refuge.'  This paper has provided the legal underpinning for the work which the CMI continued to do.<br /><br />So, in just under 500 pages, the book presents a detailed analysis of the CMI draft Instrument in all its aspects. At the same time it examines developments within the IMO and European States, together with a review of current international law and a summary of leading papers and commentaries on this topic written over the last twenty years.<br /><br />The scholarship involved is precise and formidable and in this copiously footnoted work, you'll find the expected and useful research tools, including extensive tables of international instruments, EU legislation and general legislation, as well as Tables of Cases and an extensive bibliography.  As is pointed out in the Foreword, this is an invaluable source of information and knowledge, not only about the CMI draft Instrument, but about the `enormous international legal source material that exists, but which so far has been very difficult to access' -  as compelling a reason as any to rush out and purchase this book.nd European States, together with a review of current international law and a summary of leading papers and commentaries on this topic written over the last twenty years.

0061205699|5.0|To Kill a Mockingbird is one of those books that almost every single student was assigned to read in high school whether it be a real high school or one of those fictional high schools we all see in movies and television. Woefully, I was not one of those students. And since I was (and still am) a proud nerd and bookworm, I was really looking forward to reading this as soon as I entered high school. I was so disheartened when I wasn't assigned this book or Shakespeare or Catcher in the Rye; you know, all of those books that are supposed to be a staple of your academic high school life. So, I have tried to rectify that and thought To Kill a Mockingbird would be a great way to do so. And I was not disappointed.<br /><br />I'm also weary of reading classics because I always think that they'll be difficult to read and I won't get through it (like Pride and Prejudice and Rebecca. Seriously, I've tried three times to read these two and can never get past a certain point every time). Or worse I'll get through it and realize that I loathed it. Which would then lead to all of those inevitable looks my fellow readers would give me when I say I HATED To Kill a Mockinbird. It just wouldn't be pretty. So, I put this book off for years. There was no reason for me to worry because To Kill a Mockinbird was surprisingly readable. I thought that it would take me like fifty pages to get into it, but from the first page, I was already entranced in Scout's world like it was my own. Getting into a book so deeply is what I love most about the magic of reading and that was really emphasized in this book.<br /><br />The characters were all extremely real and I loved Scout, Jem, Dill, Atticus, Calpurnia, etc. Even the Ewells, who you aren't really supposed to like, were all layered and just leapt off the page. The whole situation: the race tensions, Tom Robinson's trial, Atticus' struggle to remain noble, were all the things that contributed to make this book not only amazing, but page-turning. So much that I literally had to force myself to stop a couple of times and savor the beautiful writing.<br /><br />While many say it's a shame that Harper Lee never published anything again, I personally think that there was no way she would've ever topped the success that To Kill a Mockingbird garnered. Maybe to Lee, it seemed like this was the only story she needed to tell and she told it beautifully. To Kill a Mockingbird has become my favorite read of the year so far (tied with I Capture the Castle) and I know that this is a story that I'm going to re-read over and over again and pick up something new every time. This was definitely an amazing and enchanting novel.t I literally had to force myself to stop a couple of times and savor the beautiful writing.

B000PDYVVG|4.0|(3.5 stars)I thought this was going to be a book about eating, spirituality and love. As it turns out, it's all of that and also about making mistakes, forgiving yourself and starting over. Gilbert's writing style is open and honest as she shares her journey of finding balance and contentment in her life. She does this through completely immersing herself in three different cultures. Italy is all about the food and the intimacy of sharing meals with friends, not denying yourself simple pleasures and giving yourself permission to do nothing. India is the spiritual part of her journey. Here she conquers the art of meditation and learns the meaning of some inspirational Sanskrit phrases. This part is especially interesting for those who practice yoga or meditation. And then there's my favorite section of the book, Indonesia. Its breathtaking beauty is the perfect backdrop for finding balance and love. Gilbert writes with a delightful mix of humor and wit in a style that is easy to read and flows nicely. However, there are several sections that are slow and slightly tedious, with too much descriptive detail and no movement in plot. In short, anyone struggling with divorce or feeling disconnected to their life will easily relate to and take comfort in reading this book. Travel journal enthusiasts will also find it delightful and a great escape or those on their own spiritual journey.

0553805371|4.0|In this small book, Hawking and Mlodinow attempt to explain to us in understandable language, peppered with a dry humor, the grand design of the universe... our universe, that is. We learn that the laws operating in our universe make it possible for life to form, and that if any one of a number of factors had been just a bit different, life could not have formed. While this remarkable set of conditions, perfect for developing complex life forms such as ourselves, may make it seem that there must have been a Designer who set in motion these perfect conditions, we are told that is not the case. Why not? Well, how about all those other universes that may have completely different conditions and therefore no life forms? If ours is just one among many, than it is not remarkable that our universe began with its particular initial conditions.<br /><br />How do the authors know there are other universes? The investigation physicists have been making into the laws of our universe lead them to that conclusion. I'm going backward here from the premise with which this book begins, which is seeking answers to the Big Questions we all have, such as<br /><br />  \\"Why is there something rather than nothing?\\"<br />  \\"Why do we exist?\\"<br />  \\"Why this particular set of laws and not some other?\\"<br /><br />These are the questions of philosophy, but the authors make a remarkable statement on the very first page, stating that \\"philosophy is dead...\\"and it is up to physicists to give us answers, although many people take these questions to religious leaders, who generally endorse the idea of a Creator God. But scientists have been whittling away at all the features of our world that seem to indicate a Designer by showing us how those features are a product of the laws built into our universe. Don't laws require a Lawgiver? Well, no, they don't. Laws can just exist, and their existence is proven by experiments carried out by physicists.<br /><br />Very tiny objects (the components of atoms) behave differently from large bodies, so Newtonian physics works at the macro level, but does not hold true at the micro level. What appears to us (we are made up of trillions of atoms, so we operate on the \\"large body\\" level) to be so is not so when we look at sub-atomic particles. In other words, our senses are a poor roadmap of reality.<br /><br />The book travels through many of the recent discoveries and theories of modern physics, including the double-slit experiments with particles, showing interference patterns that seem to indicate particles can be in two places at once, and the effect of the observer on what he is observing. So much of quantum physics feels contrary to common sense. But \\"common sense\\" is a product of what we see and experience and this is unreliable when it comes to understanding our universe.<br /><br />While scientists have struggled to pull all the laws together into some kind of unified picture, the authors point to what is called \\"M-theory\\" which is an overall set of principles for universes, and which allows for different universes, each with its own laws. While the laws that operate in a universe cannot have exceptions, they are unique to that universe. The authors discuss the various ideas about the number of dimensions required for a universe, and how this affects the kind of universes that might exist.<br /><br />At this point I have to admit that much of this was tough going, and I still don't quite understand M-theory or how universes can pop up from nothing. But I applaud Hawking and Mlodinow for making the effort to explain it. Hawking is, of course, a superstar in the science world, and his previous books have informed and entertained millions of readers. Those of us who care about these questions need to know what scientists are finding, and I wanted to know what Stephen Hawking thinks about these matters. This book is well-written, with examples and illustrations; but the subject matter, while fascinating, is not always easy to grasp.<br /><br />If philosophy is really dead as a field of study and religious leaders fall back on \\"it's a miracle,\\" then who can help us find the answers? Should we accept scientists like Stephen Hawking as our 21st century philosophers? Maybe, but the conclusions in The Grand Design leave me still confused and unsatisfied. M-theory is not a very sexy - or understandable - answer. This book has, however, given me a better understanding of how physicists are going about looking for those big answers.<br /><br />Although Hawking and Mlodinow tell us the universe behaves as it does because of its own internal laws, they refrain from disparaging or ridiculing (as some other scientists turned popular authors have done) a belief in God. But they clearly endorse the idea that everything can be explained without resorting to God as the final answer.eld of study and religious leaders fall back on \\"it's a miracle,\\" then who can help us find the answers?

B000B5XOY8|4.0|The 1989 Batman film is probably the best we'll ever see of The Dark Knight in a major motion picture. At the time of this writing there has been two Batman films directed by Christopher Nolan, I won't waste time comparing Burton to Nolan but I will certain defend this first outing with Michael Keaton wearing the cape and cowl.<br /><br />There has been a common complaint that Jack Nicholson as Jack Napier aka \\" The Joker\\" takes over the picture. I believe it's safe to say that Nicholson indeed has more screentime than Keaton however that was the proper direction to take. The Joker is suppose to be the one in the limelight to soak up the attention because he because he sees himself as a great artist and entertainter and remaining Anonymous would be the last thing on mind. In the old comics, he would announce his murders on radio or television. They pay homage of sorts to these declarations in this film. But how would I rate Nicholson's preformance ? Though Jack understood Joker as a loose cannon, I don't think came off as threatening as he should have been. Nicholson was often left to flail on camera and that destroyed some credibility of the character. Despite some of the camp though, Joker did indeed seem dangerous at some points when he poisoned Gotham's personal hygiene products and at one point killing his most trusted henchman for no reason; I would like to have more of those scenes in the film.<br /><br />Another common complaint is the lack Batman's character development but it's quite the contrary, The very first crime you see committed in the film reflects that tragic night when Wayne's parents were murdered and that is just one of the great scenes that shows Batman's/Wayne's personality and motivations. Take for example Bruce's charity party to raise funds to save the festival commemorating the 200th anniversary of Gotham City. Bruce Wayne is once again saving Gotham but without his cape or cowl. Secound, notice the way Bruce acts when he socializes with Vicki Vale and others. Bruce seems to be keeping himself at arms length among his festivities by keeping to himself and lies to Vicky Vale about who is. His behavior also dosen't relfect someone who would be a famous \\"playboy\\" bachelor, you see him talking to only Vale and her collague surrounded by un-usual ar in a private room. When Bruce is confronted with a minor problem such as determining how many champagne bottles he needs to open, he seems to be a little lost and still remains so even when Alfred reports news that would obviously be important to Batman; The circumstances of simple social behavior seems to trouble him. Really, how can anyone say all this isn't character development ? We already knew from the hold up earlier to Bruce Wayne at the party that Batman is Wayne's solace and not just a mission or goal, everything else is inconsequential. This is a light hearted illustration of Bruce's loneliness. The real tragic part occurs when Bruce lies to Vicki after sleeping with her, he said he has been called out of town. What does he end up doing ? He places two roses in a dirty alley and quite obviously, it's the place where Bruce's parents were murdered. This is a sad revelation, he falls into the arms of a woman, possibly having done this more than once, but pathetically retreats into the shadows. He remains that child that lost his parents and can't find comfort.<br /><br />Now as to how Batman is presented. Again Burton has understood what the character of Batman is, a myth. As long as he remains as such, he already has the advantage of his foes and fear is merely the unknown. Once again returning to the first hold-up committed in the film, Batman lowers himself down and surprises the criminals with his cape as simulated wings. Like an animal he asserts himself as appearing bigger and more dangerous and even after he is shot down, he rises up once again with his pseudo-wings in hand to further drive the myth of being a creature and not a man; Someone who is invunerable and can not be killed. He threatens one of the thugs by dangling over the edge of building and declares himself as Batman. Really it's the perfect introduction to a theatrical character. The suit itself also combines Hollywood flash, that classic yellow symbol Batman insignia, but the rest is the vein of a classic horror figure in the vein of Bela Lugosi's Dracula or Max Schreck's Nosferatu. This is the perfect Batman for film, pure imagination from a thoughtful director.<br /><br />Now of course there comes the question of how it all puts together. This film has a great many centerpieces. Batman's introduction, The Joker's \\"birth\\", some of Joker's victims, Bruce recalling his parent's death, and of course the action sequences. Some of it has suffered because of times. Generally, the action is convential and well done but not the most memorable parts of the films. The late Derrick Meddings of James Bond fame worked on the minatures and they still do hold up today but it's pretty damn obvious those are toy cars you see when the Bat-Wing crashes. I think the only genuinely awful part of the film is the finale. After Batman and Joker, with Vicky Vale hostage, climbs to the top of a gigantic cathedral some more fights take place and Batman and Joker have a rather silly final confrontation exchanging one-liners and Joker pulling out a sight-gag. It ends with Batman and Vicki Vale dangling at the edge of cathedral with Joker flailing around like a moron and he pretty much kills himself in a rather clumsy and stupid way. A really mediocre ending to what was fine film before.<br /><br />Overall, for the many reasons stated, I think this the best live-action Batman film to date. It's flawed yes because Nicholson could have used more direction and a bit more creavity with the action but I'd say this is the Bat film that others should look up to in the future and beyound.d can not be killed.

With Mocking Jay Suzanne Collins has yet again disappointed her readers with a book that couldn't match up to The Hunger Games. The only reason for reading this book would be for finding out how the author ends the series, however prepare to begin to hate the characters that you fell in love with in Ms. Collins third installment of The Hunger Games.

0765326353|5.0|Wow, Just finished it for the 3rd time since the 31st, I just don't want to stop reading. I don't think I've ever felt a book deserved 5 stars more than this. A tremendous effort By Brandon once again. At first was a little worried about him writing two large books at once, but after finishing it all my fears went away. Not to say the book is perfect by any means, I could've used another 3-4 thousand pages to keep me busy for another night. However its way to easy to become lost in this book, and I honestly don't think I can wait for more. As someone who has read thousands if not tens of thousands of books in the last few years, almost cleaning out every bookstore I can find's SF&F sections, i have to say this one earned a well deserved place at the top of my list. Characters had outstanding development, and even though I generally start to get annoyed with the POV chapters(In this case with Shallan's) Brandon was able to keep it both interesting and engrossing the entire way through, which for a 1000 page novel is impressive to say the least. Highly recommend it for anyone looking for a new long series in the SF&F genre with a writer who won't take up 5 years and waste time promising us his next books(Cough* GRRM,Scott Lynch, Patrick Rothfuss, though he had an excuse.) Keep going strong Brandon!
0385341008|5.0|This  novel is not only a fine book to read.  It also taught me something.  During WW2, the British Channel island of Guernsey was occupied by the Germans.  This experience with all its horrors is brought to light in this delightful book.  Yes, I said this book is delightful in spite of its subject matter.  This is because of the skill of the authors, librarian Mary Ann Shaffer and her niece Annie Barrows.  Set in 1946, right after the end of the war, it consists of a series of letters between Juliet, a strongly opinionated and rather witty British journalist and a whole series of people, especially the residents of Guernsey.  The letters vary in length and really display the authors' skill in evoking a time and a place.  This is history with fictional characters, each one endearing and unique, and the narrative flows so well that it was hard to put the book down.<br /><br />I loved the characters, especially the narrator, as everything is viewed through her eyes.  It starts with a letter she receives from a gentleman living in Guernsey asking her to find a certain book for him in a London bookstore.  Now that the war is over, he is free to write letters and he describes his book club, \\"The Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Pie Society\\", which was thought up one night after a few people were caught after curfew by the Nazis and one enterprising woman in the group made up the name on the spot as an excuse for them being out so late.  During the years of occupation, this group met regularly, discussing books and supporting each other through the dreadfulness of the occupation.<br /><br />Each member of the group has correspondence with Juliet and Juliet has correspondence with her literary agent as well as his sister who is her best friend.  Each of these people come alive through their letters and it doesn't take long to be drawn into the story.  Eventually, Juliet visits Guernsey and the story develops more and more, actually giving details of some of the brutality as well an understanding of the Germans, just young soldiers who were also caught up in a war they didn't create.  I particularly liked this aspect of the book, which was written in 2008 and could not have had the same tone if it was really written in 1946 when the wounds of war were still hurting.  However, I must say that the authors got the tone of 1946 just right  --- before computers and cell phones and even copying machines.<br /><br />I loved this book and read it quickly.  I think the use of correspondence instead of straight narrative was a brilliant idea.  It is a sheer delight and I urge you not to miss it.standing of the Germans, just young soldiers who were also caught up in a war they didn't create.

B0015DROBO|3.0|First of all, this book was our book club choice for this month. I guess it appealed to us because of its great reviews, the fact that it is the first of a trilogy by a deceased author, and that it is being made into a movie. And the title is a little intriguing.  But it didn't live up to my expectations for several reasons.<br /><br />  First, let me offer a word or two of caution: The first 100 pages are dry and tedious and while pertinent to the plot, are just plain BORING unless financial journalism thrills you. So while the prologue was interesting, the first 20% of the book was at times drudgery to suffer through.<br /><br />Second, the characters were unimaginative and stereotypical. The girl with the dragon tattoo is NOT the main character, nor is she really even the focus of the story. She is just a sidekick- a surly goth chic with a tortured past, a brilliant mind, and a penchant for white collar crime. You know the type. Then you have the protagonist-a 42-year-old skirt chaser with only average skills, intellect and likeability. And even though there is no chemistry at all between them, of course they joylessly hook up. I was mildly entertained by their adventures but never really rooted for either one in particular. If either of them had been killed off, I wouldn't have been too disappointed.<br /><br />Third, I have to agree with several other reviewers that the detailed way he wrote the  rape/incest scenes was unneeded. Ok, we get it! Enough already. Every woman of importance in this book was a victim of rape, physical abuse, and/or incest (or liked S&M)! And I am by no means a prude, but Really, Larsson? I suspect he enjoyed the topic a little too much. According to the excerpt in the back of the book, the second installment has more of the same, but involves Salander as a 13 year old girl. I think I'll pass.<br /><br />With all this complaining, you may be surprised that I gave it 3 stars. I did enjoy the quest for the missing granddaughter, Harriett, and discovering all the characters of the Vanger family. I also liked his description of the small Swedish town where most of the story took place. And I was satisfied with how all the loose ends came together in the end.<br /><br />Overall,I liked the book enough to read it on my lunch break at work, but probably not enough to recommend it to someone else or give it as a gift. The chance that I'll read the sequels or watch the movie are pretty slim.all the characters of the Vanger family.

0439023513|5.0|The Mocking Jay Review<br />(This review contains spoilers)<br /><br />The Mocking Jay, the final book in the Hunger Games series was my favorite of the three, but it was a bitter pill to swallow. It's so dark, gritty, and very realistic. It doesn't sugarcoat the effects of combat, and killing. There are consequences to what Katniss and the other characters have gone through. Terrible consequences.<br /><br />I know that many readers are upset about how this series concluded. Two people I know have said they hated the book. They have good reasons to hate it, but the main issue is that they wanted a more Hollywood-type ending, or Disney ending if you will. Honestly, I would have preferred a Hollywood ending myself, but the story required a different kind of finale. I was very impressed with how Suzanne Collins unmercifully told this story and kept things rooted in the real world. It was very different from the other two books, but had similar elements that made the first Hunger Games books interesting.<br /><br />Katniss is so messed up from all that she's been through, and there is no recovering from it. My friends who hated the book wanted her to recover. I wanted her to recover. She doesn't. She goes insane, which continues her downward spiral that started at the end of book two--remember when she scratched her drunken mentor's face? Sure, we wanted Katniss to be okay. We wanted her to recover from her ordeals and survive and thrive. She can't. Why? Because she's human. She's not a Hollywood heroine.<br /><br />The message here is that we are fragile and delicate creatures. Even the ones among us who face combat and have to kill people, and most of those people in our society aren't 15 or 16 years old. Combat destroys the souls of many of the soldiers who've been through it. I'm talking about strong men and women, like the ones I've taken care of at the V.A. hospital where I used to work as a nurse. The reality of war isn't pretty. I think this book is the Saving Private Ryan of the mainstream literary world. Saving Private Ryan was the biggest antiwar movie of the last twenty years, beside Schindler's List, both directed by Stephen Spielberg.<br /><br />Those were important movies to see, but they weren't fun at all. Collins out does Spielberg in some ways. Private Ryan survives. In many ways, Katniss does not. She's a different person, and what she fought hardest for, dies a horrible death. The fact that someone so important to Katniss died set up the ending for me when she chose a different target than the one she was supposed to hit. I agree with her move. I think it was the right one. I don't think she was manipulated at all there. She took out the real evil, though both targets were evil to the core. That was the strongest decision her character made in the whole series, and I did not see it coming. Bravo to Suzanne Collins for that one.<br /><br />If The Mocking Jay were a heroic fantasy novel, Katniss would have probably come out a lot better than she did. I personally would have had her rise to the occasion and overcome her mental issues, though she would be damaged forever and bear great scars from all of it. I would have portrayed her as a strong character, making more decisions, and driving the plot, rather than being a prop for the rebel government's commercials. She would have chosen her man at the end, rather than having the choice made for her. However, this is a dark science-fiction novel, and don't kid yourself, this is science-fiction, though the publisher has decided to market it as mainstream, which is the reason why so many people read it.<br /><br />These books are commentary on the world today like all good science-fiction. According to an interview I heard, Collins wrote these books with several things in mind, and she discusses a few of those ideas at the end of the audio book I listened to. She was watching the coverage of the war in Iraq and also watching some reality shows, and thought about howthe two could be combined. She also was thinking of the ancient Greek myth of Theseus, where children were sacrificed to the minotaur every year, and Thesues volunteered to go.<br /><br />What's the message the author was trying to convey? Sacrificing your children because you can't agree on something is wrong. Sending children (or anyone) off to war is not the right idea. The human race needs to figure out a better way of solving problems.<br /><br />Yes, there are other points that Collins was trying to make, such as: don't trust dictators or over-powerful governments, like the ones that exist today in our own world.<br /><br />This whole series is supposed to make you think, and I'm so glad that Suzanne Collins had the courage to write these books, and write the ending she did. I think the publishers heard the pitch several years ago and decided to push these novels down the throats of America's youth. It was a message the kids and adults needed to hear. Readers would be lured in after the first book, and then the second would wet their appetite even more, and then when they were least expecting it, the third book comes out and proves to be more than cheap entertainment. It has a message. Not a pretty message.<br /><br />We want our heroes to come out on top and be okay. The truth of it is that in the real world, they're not okay. They are broken people, like Katniss.<br /><br />I'm so glad large numbers of people have read these books. Kids, and adults, need to be thinking about the issues raised in the series. The message isn't new, but many of the generation who are reading these books haven't heard it yet.<br /><br />When I do school visits on my book tours I'm excited to be able to talk about The Hunger Games. There is substance here. It's not some ridiculous and sparkly world where reality is distorted beyond belief. This is a post-apocalyptic world not so far removed from the one we live in today.<br /><br />The Mockingjay is a bitter and mostly unsatisfying pill to swallow, but it shows the truth and holds up a mirror to all of us. We don't like the way we really look, and perhaps for the first time we're confronted with who we really are.<br /><br />Paul Genesse<br />Author of The Golden Cord<br />[...]ancient Greek myth of Theseus, where children were sacrificed to the minotaur every year, and Thesues volunteered to go.

The qualities that made me appreciate that book, ie thorough research, good method of chronology and chaptering and humour, I did not find in \\"Mother tongue\\". Limguistics, as opposed to science, is in my opinion an art and requires a full knowledge of the culture and history behind any language and hence also behind all those that \\"chipped in\\" to shape it.

B001O2MBMI|5.0|If you want my opinions about Leona Lewis's vocals or songs from her first album you can find them on my review for her originally released Spirit CD, this review is just for the additional tracks and the DVD from her deluxe edition of Spirit.<br /><br />I'm a Leona Lewis fan, that's for sure, so that may be why her deluxe edition for her first album Spirit is getting a flat out five star rating. But I do have some reasons for the given rating. But before I discuss the three new songs on this CD, I'd like to talk about the changes for her two songs \\"Better in Time\\" and \\"Footprints in the Sand.\\" For the deluxe edition the two original recordings of these songs have been replaced with the single mixes. To my surprise, I actually liked the single mix for \\"Better in Time\\" more than the original, the piano intro is extended and I thought it sounded lovely. In my opinion the single mix could have been even better if it was just a piano ballad, but it is a great mix nonetheless. Also included is a remix created by Jason Nevins for Leona Lewis's hit \\"Bleeding Love.\\" The two single mixes from her first album are the only changes, besides the \\"Bleeding Love\\" remix but that's an additional track, now let's discuss the three new songs on her deluxe edition! The first new song is \\"Myself\\" and is a duet with Novel. Novel has a unique voice, and it sounds very nice to say the least. The next song \\"Run\\" is probably reason alone to buy this CD. It's a strange enchanting song and I absolutely loved it. The last new song on this CD is \\"Forgiveness\\" and I absolutely LOVED this track. I haven't heard a song like this from Leona before, it just makes me smile. This is also the first time I've ever heard Leona talk her lyrics during a song, \\"if everyone could just forgive, the world would be a much better place...forgiveness.\\" I really hope she sings more songs like this in the future. These three songs are just great additions to the CD. I do wish \\"A Moment Like This\\" was included on the CD though, but nonetheless it's a great CD.<br /><br />But this isn't the end of Spirit the Deluxe Edition. There also is a DVD with seven of Leona Lewis's music videos. I don't really like music videos because many of them don't make the least bit of since, but I thought Leona Lewis's were made very well, I'm just sick of half dressed women dancing seductively in every single music video, I mean of course it catches my attention but it's so unoriginal, fortunately Leona Lewis stays clear from this. I wasn't going to talk much about the music videos...but I just have to mention a couple. The music video for \\"Forgive Me\\" seemed very Americanized, and Leona Lewis finally shows off some dance moves (And she's not that bad a dance either) But it really doesn't seem to be her style, and I just had to laugh, she had the strut going and everything but she's just too nice to sell it, even when she's trying to act tough she still seems like the nicest person in the world. She also gets to wear a top hat and ride a carousel......just watch the music video. The music video for Run was FANTASTIC. It's not my favorite song, but her music video for \\"Run\\" is very interesting. To me it was like...how about I give you a qoute from Leona, the song takes place \\"an enchanted, haunted forest. It's picking up on different elements of the song.\\" That was similiar to what I was thinking. Leona Lewis looks beautiful in her music videos and while yet a couple of her music videos were confusing and seeming to go no where, they were still nice to watch. Down below is a list of each new single mix, remix and song on her CD, and a list of the music videos on the DVD;<br /><br />CD -<br /><br />Better In Time (Single Mix) (3:52)<br /><br />Footprints in the Sand (Single Mix) (3:56)<br /><br />Myself (A duet with Novel) (3:50)<br /><br />Run (4:37)<br /><br />Forgiveness (4:20)<br /><br />Bleeding Love (Remix by Jason Nevins) (3:41)<br /><br />DVD -<br /><br />Bleeding Love (US Edition)<br /><br/>Bleeding Love (UK Edition)<br /><br />Better in Time<br /><br />Footprints in the Sand<br /><br />Forgive Me<br /><br />Run<br /><br />I Will Be (Live)<br /><br />If you're a fan of Leona Lewis, what are you waiting for?

And if you've been holding off on the series to see if the ending was any good, you may now safely commence reading.<br /><br />At the end of Catching Fire, some of the surviving players have broken out of the arena, capitol rebels have demonstrated their intent, and District Twelve has been destroyed. The uprising (and corresponding smackdown) are both well underway. While all this appears to be Katniss's doing, really all she was trying to do was survive and save people she cared about. Rebellion was inevitable. Still, she's the proximate cause of the revolution. Now what? Will she step up as leader and encourage the rebellion? Will she try get everyone to cease hostilities? Or will she just nurse her wounds and hide?<br /><br />The tone here is a little more grim (hard to imagine, I know!) but before it was just the contestants fighting for their lives -- now it's the whole nation. There's still occasional humor, a good amount of clever, interesting, horrifying developments, and numerous well-rounded secondary characters.<br /><br />For the most part, everything progresses logically, though the initial premise is so absurd it's hard sometimes to gauge what's reasonable. In particular, some of the capital defense strategies are hard to fathom. But their entire rule was hard to fathom, so... yeah. My biggest criticism (and I seem to be the only one in this) is that I never understood President Snow's motivation. He just seems evil. Creepy disturbing clever evil, but still. Nothing deeper.<br /><br />I won't say anything about the ending except this: once you finish the book, go back and read the first few chapters of The Hunger Games, and see how carefully that ending has been set up. (This is not a spoiler.) I was very impressed. The writing looks easy and effortless -- no fancy prose, no especially stunning plot twists -- but the whole arc shows serious forethought and skill.<br /><br />As for the series as a whole: I thought it was very well written and quite enjoyable. But if you want a realistic science fiction novel THIS IS NOT IT. This is a greek myth made into a young adult novel. The superficial trappings of SF are used to create the setting, but the setting's purpose is solely to amplify the peril and the moral questions of the plot, not to extrapolate anything. I happen to think that's a perfectly reasonable use for science fiction, but there are lots of passionate readers who will not agree.

0553378384|5.0|A friend recommended this book to kind of introduce me to astrology.  All I can say is WOW.  It is so dead on accurate it is scary.  It's like she climbed into my mind and wrote down my personality, and how I react to situations and what I need ect... It is very interesting to read about yourself, but also read about others.  For a couple of people in my life, the accuracy of their personalities was so accurate and eye opening it was alarming for them. One person who has a lot of negative things in her life and never gets what she wants read her section and really didn't want to hear it.  Because the areas she needed to work on were TRUE and she didn't really want to admit it, or hear it.  I would recommend this book for anyone who is OPEN to hearing these things and understands that maybe some of it might not be accurate, but for the most part (in my experience) it was creepy how much of it IS. It really does give insight to not only yourself, but others as well.
B003XWEQ1G|5.0|This is the best version of Robin Hood I've seen.  The Kevin Costner one was entertaining like a popcorn flick, Mel Brook's Men in Tights was a hilarious musical spoof.  The Errol Flynn and the Douglas Fairbanks versions were...well...Cheezy even though they're classics.  However, this new Ridley Scott and Russel Crowe re-imagining is tougher, darker, grittier, and much more badass. The story was quite interesting and much deeper than all the previous versions, maybe a bit too deep, but nonetheless it was a fantastic journey back to back to the 12th Century to discover how Robin Longstride became Robin of the Hood.  Ridley Scott is the master of historical epics (The Duellists, 1492: Conquest of Paradise, Gladiator, Kingdom of Heaven) and Robin Hood truly delivers in every aspect from production design to photography.  I wish they would make a sequel but that's long shot.  My only disappointment with this film was it didn't have the inspiring feeling that Gladiator had or the jaw dropping AWW. I'm definitely buying the Bluray/DVD combo pack.
0439023513|1.0|I read the trilogy along with my eighth grade son. I must say the first two books caught my attention and I enjoyed the read.     The Mockingjay was an abject disappointment compared to the first two books. If I ever thought a book/story was \\"put together\\" to finish a series then the Mockingjay examples that thought. Ms. Collins should be ashamed! The characters seem contrived in their respective circumstances. Katniss shows herself as a whiner; a self-doubter; as a weak link in a line of strong \\"tributes.\\" Katniss does not deserve our respect or sympathy.    My son, when we finally discussed the final book, expressed his disappointment with the book. Maybe not to extent I do or did but in his own way found the book, story line and characters as weak as I did.    A very poor conclusion to a very good start.
B00026WU82|5.0|This album has been reviewed in enough depth by all the reviewers below,so there is not much more I can say about it.<br /><br />Dylan should have received the Noble prize for poetry for this album alone.

Out of all of my albums which I have collected for the last 55 years,(replacing a lot of my vinyls with cds) I consider Highway 61 Revisited to be the best album ever produced.<br /><br />I bought this album the year it was released and have at least 3 copies inclucing the gold cd.<br />There is not a song writer that ever lived, that could or will ever be able to outdo Dylan.<br /><br />There is really nothing else to say about it except if you have never heard the entire album you have missed something really great and unequalled in music.
B001RCD2DW|5.0|First thing to remember, the AKG K702 is a traditional set of \\"reference\\" headphones which require some significant voltage to drive. BASS requires more voltage. The little device you jog with probably won't drive the K702 or anything else in its class.     That said, the full spectrum of sound, including the BASS just knocked me over from the first listen. I have now given these headphones 50 hours of break-in time and they just sound better and better. From Led Zeppelin to Marcin Wasilewski Trio, I am delighted and look forward to what these will sound like after more break-in time.     Speaking of Led Zeppelin, I just compared the 1990 box set with the 2008 SHMCD Boxset. The K702's effortlessly detailed how each track (guitar, vocal, drums, etc) were remastered. I immediately formed an opinion as to what parts I liked and disliked in the 2008 remix and what I wished the engineer had handled different. I can't do that with my expensive speakers and amp!     And speaking of the Marcin Wasilewski Trio, I could hear a string vibrating (perhaps on the bass?) in sympathy to the piano on track 3. I never heard that before!     I could go on and on but I'll speak to a few other things.     I upgraded my headphone cable to the Blue Dragon Ver. 3 by Moon Audio. The K702 is great on its own but the Moon Audio cable opens up the soundstage and the detail of each instrument and vocal. Yeah, it cost almost as much as the K702 but when AKG put a removable cable on the headphone, they almost advertised \\"replace this cable.\\"     I am also using the Turtle Beach Amigo and Amigo II external USB Soundcards with great success. I have also done well with the headphone output on various stereo components from Denon, Harman Kardon and Onkyo. I have a dedicated headphone amp on order but I won't mention the brand since it hasn't arrived. Apple iPods and other portables do NOT work with the K702. I have the Cowon audio S9 and it seems to drive the K702 well enough (although not extremelyloud).     Another benefit of the K702 is the ability to hear the nuance of every note at low volume. I can wear these and hear my wife. This works for both of us. Nice!
B001GF7WRW|2.0|Well let me start off with the good.     FIT    AMAZING! You never even knew they were there. The self-adjusting strap is genius. Now , yes, if you start violently shaking your head or you are a head banger then you may have a problem with them staying on.     BUILD QUALITY  I thought they seemed very solid for the forty odd dollars I paid to get them from amazon was not bad at all. They may not have been the most solid headphones out there , but I have no complaints they were good as far as I am concerned.     SOUND  Now here is where they did not even come close to my expectations. I immediately tried them on as soon as I got them. The sound was atrocious. The sound in general sounded muffled and muddy. There was not very much bass. I compared them to my Sennheiser HD 202, and the 202s completely blew them put of the water. I could not believe that my $25 headphones were beating headphones that would normally retail for close to $100! I immediately called them company about returning them and repackaged them and sent them back.     Overall I would not recommend these to anyone. I recently picked up a pair of Sennheisser HD 595 and they are divine. GOt a great deal on a new pair off eBay.
B003AMAOW4|4.0|Even reviewers who dismissed the direction of this production as \\"eurotrash\\" tended to admire Kent Nagano and the musical values; and the power of the acting and singing of Jonas Kaufmann, Anja Harteros, Wolfgang Koch and Michaela Schuster.  I think that they are all marvellous.<br /><br />Where I have trouble is with the realisation of the director's concept.  Instead of a dreamy passive Elsa waiting for a protector, we have a strong woman who knows what she wants:  basically a family of her own and stability.  Lohengrin too is after much the same thing -- presumably the sterility of Montsalvat was getting to him.  That is understandable.  But this is symbolised by the building of a house which progresses until the roof is put on at the beginning of Act III.  It is a huge house and requires many workers toiling away in the background (and sometimes the foreground with with wheelbarrows and bundles of bricks) -- and it is all too too busy and distracting as the drama of the opera and its conflicts unfolds stage front.<br /><br />That is unfortunate because the conflicts are so stark and the performers are so good.<br /><br />On the other hand, all this building, and obvious need of Elsa and Lohengrin for each other within their home, leads inevitably to its loss and the tragedy of Act III.  I have never seen it done so powerfully and with such pathos.  Kaufmann's despair and interpretation of the music is a marvel -- as is that of Harteros.<br /><br />The other twist, with which purists might disagree, is that Elsa does not die.  (I have seen this before in Herzog's Bayreuth production where, if I remember correctly, Elsa and Ortrud join hands as Gottfried appears just before the final curtain.)  Here, with the appearance of Gottfried, Elsa puts away thoughts of her departed husband and invests herself in Gottfried, her recovered brother, and the  presumed stability to come.<br /><br />All told, I found it a most emotionally absorbing and stimulating production.  There are many many strengths which put it above other productions.  But if only there were not so many busy obvious workers bustling about the stage.  That (reluctantly) takes away one star.<br /><br />P.S.  I should have mentioned that I have made comments on the reviews of AMY and Dankwort.  If you are interested, there they are.it above other productions.  But if only there were not so many busy obvious workers bustling about the stage.  That (reluctantly) takes away one star.

B0036EH3XE|5.0|The groundbreaking show, that has taken it's audience into a mystified journey tethered on the turfs of fate and coincidence, good versus evil, love and scorn, life and death, finally came full circle with it's long awaited two and a half hours series finale, aptly titled \\"The End\\". The ending redefines the essence of television in the 21st century: in which a heavily serialized show abound with complex fabrication manages to entertain, educate and spark enthusiasms in the modern age of blogospheres and the evergrowing like-minded Internet community.      I was brought in for the ride six years ago, not knowing the impact it would have on me. A classical tale about a group of survivors stranded on a mysterious island seems too elaborate and bears little entertainment value. After the pilot aired and when Charlie (the rock-star character who died trying to safe his friends from an impending doom in the third season of the show) asked with a puzzling look on his face: \\"Guys, where are we?\\" - the hook was set almost immediately.      LOST is inventive in its own indefinite genre, hallmarked by its shrewd devices in storytelling. It is artful without looking down on its audience and doesn't, in return, demands anything from them. Instead it did the direct opposite by having the writers to playfully sprinkle the implications of science, religion, philosophy, psychology, literature and history throughout the show, indirectly confounding the audience and consequently brought about an off-the-wall change in regards to the way a TV show is being dissected. Critics have been religiously analyzing, hard-core fans created their own theories, casual fans speculated, tweeted and blogged about their personal views. LOST has gradually amassed a modern and vocal audience unlike any other.      It must be said that to be a LOST viewer, one has to regard oneself as a freak. To miss an episode is like sinking into obscured territories. Mysteries after mysteries started to evolve and answers tend to pratfall and delved into hiding as the series propels. But once it progresses to a definite end date, some of the important answers finally began to reveal itself, often poignantly and at times off the mark, disproving the loyal fan's speculations. Indeed, no show would be able to please every single viewer, hence the ending eventually brought about two conflicting camps: the ones who were fully satisfied and the others who felt somewhat robbed. I for once believe that the journey is much sweeter than the final destination.      LOST can be seen as a convoluted piece of art, a poetry that disguises itself as an enigma and a tapestry of a magnified question-mark. It fills itself with perceptive contraptions and perplexing materials that breaks away from the one-sided school of narrative exercises. Game-changers and cliffhangers aplenty, it tends to throw audience into all sorts of direction but not dispossessing them. LOST provides a platform for similar genre to flourish, but alas they meet their demises (Heroes and FlashForward for examples). It is one of the earliest shows to truly put forth an international casting, a show not afraid to break all the safe episodic TV rules and even more unafraid to bring in politically-incorrect characters (Republican Guard torturer, anyone?) into the intricate scheme.      When seen from a broader perspective, it is a show that talks about life in its basic entity, about you and me, about the castaways burdened with various issues: parental, personal as well as emotional. Flashbacks on their private lives created windows of opportunity for the viewers to slip into their past and see how these people react to the ongoing island events. The past tends to build the foundation of who these characters are, and their decisions on the present often parallels the story of their past. The beauty (or ugliness) of LOST lies in the anecdotes and development of these troubled characters, and they were done by not resorting to the usually trite soap-opera motives. Even when nonessential episodes like Exposé tend to hinder the show's momentum, they are good storytelling on its own.      The mythological and scientific parts of LOST are one of the aspects that took TV to a whole new level. Not wanting to back down or conform to the exposition in a common heroes-versus-villains syllabus, the writers gave the setting (in this case the mythical island) it's own historical storyline, at the same time peppering pseudo-methodical topics that goes way beyond our heads, such as time-travel, electromagnetism, quantum mechanics, pregnancy among others. Mixed these into the characters' interconnectivity beats and you have a contemporary saga flashes before your eyes.      Too much have been said about LOST and many more are bound to surface after the series greets it's final curtain call. Missing the show is an oversimplification, but yes, there will be no shows (not right away, I guess) that are able to fill the vacuum in this self-named geek who loves mystery-laden parables invigorated with character back-stories and thematic allusions. Like reading a good fiction, the end is bittersweet.
B0035V35PI|5.0|this movie has everything it you need to have for a well written and portrayed ninja movie.  the flash back scenes just added to how cruel and brutal ninja training really was.  This movie started off with action,Blood/gore and it continued throughout.  the special effects used for the filming of the fight scenes were great.  I love when you saw the ninja stars being thrown and saw the air move behind it.  If you enjoy ninja or martial art movies this movie is for you.    The fight scenes were not done overexaggerated in the slightest.  When the katana was used to cut the other ninjas in half, that would really happen in real life.  that is how the katana was designed.  this movie stays true to how ninja clans live and survive.  one of the best ninja movies I have seen latly.  If you like this movie check out Ninja.

B00133KHCY|5.0|I don't have a single bad thing to say about this movie. It was so awe inspiring. The only negative about the whole thing is probably Robin Williams, but only because he was such a nasty character. The music used in the movie is so beautiful and the plot/story is one of the most inspirational I've seen in a very long time. The ending has to be the ultimate in movie endings, I've seen this close to five times and I've cried every single one of those. I would even recommend NOT renting, because you can save the money you would spend that way to purchase this movie since it is more than worth it. More so on blu-ray, the details and colors are amazing.
B001IBIHQ4|2.0|While there is definitely much to admire when it comes to The Pacific -- great battle sequences, solid acting, great special effects, etc. -- it suffers from an acute lack of CONTEXT. In all the episodes, we never really get a sense of what the men are fighting for, why they are there, etc. While I guess that's true-to-form for the soldier in the ground, it doesn't help us, the viewer, understand what is for many a lesser known theatre of the Second World War.     For instance, why were they on Peliliu? A quick Wikipedia search discovers the island was needed for an airfield.Did you know John Basilone won the Navy Cross for his actions on Iwo Jima -- dramatically illustrated in Episode 8. How exciting it would have been were a post-script included to explain this fact, rather than requiring us to rely on Wikipedia.     This isn't helped by a very poor view of the Japanese as combat adversaries -- when the reality was quite different. My understanding of the Pacific war as formed by research during the Second World War is that American troops were often demoralized fighting the Japanese because they never gave themselves up and often planted booby traps and hid themselves to attack American units from behind. This is touched on during The Pacific, but there's never a sense of foreboding, of dread that around each turn or every corner, there lurked a potential enemy waiting to ambush them. In many ways, the Japanese are presented as pop-up villains, similar to that found in a video game. They pop up, get killed and action moves on to the next group. Perhaps this was the case, but the U.S. suffered 10,000 casualties on Peliliu (did you know that?) so I somehow doubt that was the case. Indeed, it was only after watching the series that research revealed Peliliu was one of the bloodiest and most controversial battles for the Marine Corps in WWII. Did you?     Both my points are illustrated during one sequence in Episode 7, when Eugene's mortar company sets up near a bunker which is thought to be abandoned. They discover that it is not, in fact, empty when Japanese begin firing. However, the way the episode is filmed and action proceeds, there's no tension. Considering the presentation by the Japanese prerviously, did you really believe he was in any danger whatsoever when charged by a katana-wielding soldier? If so, your suspension of disbelief is greater than mine.      While many have commented that it's unfair to compare Band of Brothers with The Pacific, I think it's a fair subject considering that many of the same producers and directors were involved in both efforts. Band of Brothers, however, is a far-superior series because it does try to establish context, there's narrative and we feel we can really come to know and care about the characters. And there is very real tension, even if you know the outcome. Watch the series and tell me you don't feel tense during the bombardments near Bastogne? Or that you don't feel the war weariness of Capt. Winters after he shoots the young German soldier?    True, The Pacific attempts to reach this level of empathy -- Eugene's confrontation with a Japanese samurai, for instance. But soon after, he announces he hopes the Japanese don't surrender so he can kill all of them (???). Was anybody looking over the script here?    Overall, I did enjoy The Pacific but was extremely disappointed that such a hyped-up and interesting project fell so short of what it could have been. While I feel like I learned something about American soldiers during the Second World War in Europe, my understanding of the conflict in the Pacific is still short of reality. And this series does nothing to remedy that.

B00003CX9Q|5.0|This has to be one of the 5 best science fiction films ever made!  This edition has two DVD's, one contains the original version we all remember from 1982 (I was sixteen, my brother was ten, and we all laughed at the van scene because I was also going for my driver's license) as well as a second disc which contains Steven Spielberg's edited version.<br /><br />I happen to like both equally well.  I thought Steven eliminating the guns was a nice touch.  In real life, I sure hope the Feds wouldn't pull guns on kids like that!  If they did, it says a lot about how we're becoming a police-state and need to rethink a few things, even in the current climate of fear in view of terrorism.<br /><br />This was a classic, magical movie, that anyone would enjoy watching over and over.<br /><br />It was also the very first DVD I bought when I broke down and purchased a combination DVD player/VHS recorder.

I started reading the Dragonlance series shortly after and probably read every published work at that time.  After that I started reading science fiction books mostly by Asimov but I also read the Ender's game series.  I am now in my thirties but wanted to start reading more fiction again.  A few months ago I decided to read Lord of the Rings.  Once I was done I wanted to read some more high fantasy but didn't know where to start.  A friend recommended the Drizzt novels and I couldn't put them down.  I read the first two in 3 days.  Homeland is very much a bildungsroman, much like Ender's Game, but set in the world of the Drow elves.  I highly recommend this book to anyone who is a fan of Lord of the Rings, Dragonlance, Ender's Game, etc...

1416595554|5.0|When I purchased Sashenka, I knew that if nothing else, I would be getting a historically accurate read. I expected nothing less from Simon Montefiore, who has written two biographies of Stalin, including the award winning Young Stalin, and who has also delved into the relationship between Potemkin and Catherine the Great, in Catherine the Great and Potemkin - The Imperial Love Affair. My concern was whether Montefiore would be able to make the transition from biographies to fiction without over-burdening the story with minute historical details. I needn't have worried. Sashenka's tale sweeps you in from the first chapter, and doesn't let you go until long after you have turned the final page.     We first meet Sashenka in 1916 St. Petersburg -\\"Piter\\". Russia is poised on the brink ofrevolution and a sixteen year old Sashenka has made the decision to turn her back on the world she knows, and join the Bolshevik cause. It is through her young idealistic eyes that we see the final days of Tsarist Russia and a foreshadowing of what Russia is set to become. Sashenka will learn that people have very long memories and that choices we make when we are young can come back to haunt us. In the second part of the book, Russia 1939, Sashenka is now a married woman, living the communist dream. She has survived Stalin's reign of terror and come out unscathed, but many of her friends have not been so fortunate. But is the \\"Terror\\" truly over? In the final part of the book, Montefiore takes us to Russia after the fall of communism, again, through the eyes of a young woman. Katinka, a historian, who has taken an assignment to help a woman find her past. With her help, Sashenka's story can finally come to its conclusion.    Montefiore states that historians generally write about extraordinary people who've shaped world events and that in Sashenka, he wanted to write about how an ordinary family coped with the triumphs and tragedies of twentieth-century Russian history. Well, he succeeds, but there is nothing ordinary about this book. Montefiore manages to use his expert knowledge of Russian history, customs and traditions without bogging down the story. Each historical detail serves to make the experience more realistic for the reader.     Yet the most phenomenal thing about this book were the characters. In Montefiore's Sashenka, two-dimensional characters do not exist. He breaths life into each character, whether featured throughout the book, or simply mentioned on one page. I found myself loving and hating Sashenka at different times throughout the story, she became real to me, as real as any of the non-fictional characters who were featured in this novel.     In fact, the only negative thing I can say about Sashenka is that I wish I had more information about her \\"missing years\\" - I wanted to know everything! This book was truly a joy to read, both for the history buff and mystery lover in me, but it was more than that. Sashenka is about family, friendship, love, loyalty and the ties that bind them together. Montefiore has proven that a good writer is capable of transcending genres, when a story needs to be told.     ~ N     [...].

0553805371|5.0|Widely called The Most Purchased, Least Read Book in American Publishing History, Stephen Hawking's treatise on black holes and space-time was a classic amongst science writing, as well it ought to be. It managed to take extremely abstract and difficult to understand material and make it approachable for thirteen-year-olds. (I was one of said teenagers.)     That said, the material in that book was, to my mind, simpler and more intuitive than what was in this book. Somehow, though, Stephen Hawking and Leonard Mlodinow managed to take even trickier material (and far, far more counterintuitive science) and make it approachable for lay folk.     Inside, we are taught a brief history of science, from Thales to Feynman, and many of the thinkers in between. We learn of the intuitive theories of Newton and the bizarre realm of quantum realities. As a person who was familiar with wave-particle duality exhibited by subatomic and elementary particles, there was an amazing moment where experiments done with fullerene (a particle roughly 40 times as massive as water) exhibited the same phenomenon. Literally, there were a half-dozen world-view changing moments in this book for me.     As at least one news website has (woefully!) spoiled for all of us, Hawking's beliefs on the creation of the universe are here, and he doesn't make us wait for his point of view (it's on page 9). That said, there is no polemic, no screeching rant against creationism or even intelligent design. He merely seems to take the position of Laplace. He is far more offensive, actually, with other statements, particularly about philosophy. Yes, much like memoiai, I cringed at the speculation that \\"philosophy is dead\\", merely because \\"philosophers have not kept up with science\\". Certainly, by the time the book closes, he makes the case that philosophers generally will have to do some catching up if they are to remain the metaphysicians and epistomologists amongst us (but other realms of philosophy, thankfully, remain intact).     Despite a few such grandiose claims (the claim that all biology is a result of the electromagnetic force leaps to mind), this is by no means a belligerent or offensive tract. Rather, it shines through in the entirety of the book, and on virtually every page, that both scientists have the single goal of enlightening and perhaps, dare I say it, entertaining.    It is rare (alas!) to find a book so accurate, so detailed, so educational, and so darned fun to read. This is certainly one that I will read again, and I have already started recommending it to others. (Usually, I start with the mischievous statement, \\"Want to break your brain?\\").    It's great. It really is. Things like this are why he deserves a Medal of Freedom, and perhaps a Nobel Prize in Peace as well.    Harkius
B003W5C0VW|5.0|I'm very grateful that this is FINALLY coming out, all spiffed up & rechanneled.  I've had the boot for about 10 yrs but it's like looking at a Poloroid of the Mona Lisa.  This is right exactly WHERE Rock & Roll PEAKED: the wave crested and broke right here.  Once you get this, compare it that \\"Shine A Light\\" POS, you'll see what I mean.  Ron Wood is NOT Mick Taylor (check out the second guitar solo on \\"Love In Vain\\"), and c leavell AIN'T Ian Stewart or Nicky Hopkins.  There is no better ANYWHERE!

0307269752|4.0|A pale, anorexic young woman with a dragon tattoo on her left shoulder is the heroine of this story. Behind her sullen facade, Lisbeth Salander has an unusual intelligence and is quite the computer hacker.<br />  The main plot deals with Lisbeth working for Mickael Blomkvist who has been given the impossible task by Henrik Vanger of finding out which family member killed his beloved grand niece Hariet Vanger.<br />  A very interesting side plot deals with Salander and her guardian Bjurman, who was a sadist and a rapist. That scene in which she 'fixed him well and proper' was priceless. Unfortunately that was the last we saw of Bjurman. I would have liked to view his predicament in a doctor's office or at a tattoo parlour looking for a tattoo cover-up.<br />  It seems that the villains in the story after wreacking so much havoc get off much too easily. This was somewhat dissatisfying.
0439023513|2.0|I LOVED the first two books. Absolutely loved. I pre-ordered Mockingjay and waited in anticipation for this book to arrive in the mail. I tore into it the second it arrived, and I was just flat out disappointed.     First of all, in the first two books there is much human emotion, connection between the characters, evolving relationships. I felt like there was NONE of that in this book. It was nothing but endless wars and bombs and fighting and planning to fight, and strategy, and filming propos... It was like... allrighttt enough already this book needs more depth!    The only human connection in the book happened with the reunion of Finnick and Annie, it was such a great thing to happen and then Finnick dies by being beheaded by the mutts. Nothing more is said about him. He had such a prominent role in Katniss's life, helping her in her times of sorrow, and by having her back in war, and then he dies, and nothing at all is said. There's no explanation of how Annie took it or how Katniss felt, nothing.     It's within the last 20 pages or so that the book actually picked up to where I actually started to take a liking to it and then the last 3 pages was more or less the author saying, \\"Well, the book needs to end ... soooo Prim dies, Gale moves, Katniss marries/lives with Peeta, 15 years pass, they have two kids, the end.\\"    There was absolutely no reason for Prim to be killed off either. Was there a shock value Collins was going for? I think so, but it didn't shock me, it totally missed the mark and fell flat. I didn't get the point. Most of her trust worthy friends had been killed, what was the reason for Prim being offed?    I also don't get how for the first two books there is such an intense love coming from Gale and he has such unrequited love, he shows her, and then at the end of this book where Katniss's sister is killed, her friends are dead, she's an emotional disaster, he just goes on with his new big shot job, moves to 2 and never returns. What the hell is that?    There's also no mention of Katniss ever seeing her mother again, so who knows if that even happened...    The ending was the biggest copout of life. There just wasn't much substance to this book at all in my opinion. Any number of things could have been done with the final book, and this whole \\"War is Bad!\\" message is sending was a bit over the top. We know war is bad, people die, families are torn apart, but it doesn't need to be shoved in our faces, especially as the final book in a trilogy. This book should have went out with a bang. Instead it just fizzled, sputtered, and died.
B002RWKSII|5.0|I really think George Gershwin would have been chuffed to hear this recording.  In many ways the music of Gershwin and Wilson have similar sounds and themes.  Brian Wilson's renditions of traditional Gershwin songs is true, but with a Wilson edge which makes the song his own.  I love listening to this CD.  The Gershwin's wrote a lot of wonderful music, so maybe Brian Wilson will record some more, and while he's at it, Cole Porter. Irving Berlin, Harold Arlen and Co were pretty fantasic too.

0385341008|4.0|Although not a fan of historical fiction in general, I liked this story about an author who dumb-luckily gets connected to an island full of colorful characters, learns a lot about its occupation (by the Germans) during WWII, and gains long-term, life-changing relationships with some of its inhabitants. The story starts slowly, as its main character, author Juliet Ashton, shares potential subject ideas with her long time friend and publisher, Sidney Stark. Fluke-like, she soon gets connected with Dawsey Adams, an island of Guernsey resident, with whom she continues to correspond. As she's in the process of trying to track down her next writing topic, Adams easily intrigues her with tidbits about islanders' occupation-era experiences. Her interest gradually increases, as does the number of Guernseyans with whom she corresponds in order to learn all she can about the occupation's effect on the island's inhabitants. Things get really good when she takes a trip to visit her newfound friends.<br /><br />Information about the occupation and the character development make the book a worthwhile read, but it has its flaws (alert - semi-spoiler ahead), the primary one being that the ultimate intended object of Ashton's affections (which even I, Ms. Oblivious, figured out at page 9) was too obvious, making the author's attempts to direct readers' attentions toward another entirely unsuitable suitor a waste of time. In spite of that (and another totally-saw-it-coming incident involving Billee Bee), TGLaPPPS is still a decent read. Also interesting: The Amazing Story of Adolphus Tips by Michael Morpurgo, Suite Francais by Irene Nemirovsky and Ella Minnow Pea by Mark Dunn.

6305263248|4.0|\\"Ronin\\" keeps you guessing and guessing, but the action is wild and woolly.  Lots of backstabbing and who do you trust issues?<br /><br />The story revolves around a metal briefcase with undisclosed contents coveted by Irish terrorists and the Russian mob.  Robert De Niro plays an ex CIA agent, who trusts no one, but needs the money.Natascha McElhone plays the Irish liaison who is responsible for assembling a group of mercenaries to get the metal case in her hands.  The team plays hard and there are many wild chase scenes.  Many bystanders are killed or maimed during these chases but for some reason the story goes on and on about who gets the case?<br /><br />When all is said and done, it is entertaining and full of intrigue.
B000NU2CY4|5.0|The remastered Blu-ray version (Yellow UPC Code) is stunning, and the movie itself is very good.  As I indicated in the previous sentence the remastered version is identified by a YELLOW UPC Code on the back of the case, and \\"2-Disc Set\\" above the Paramount Logo on the bottom right of the back of the case.  I still have the original Blu-ray version of Gladiator and have decided to keep it just in case it might become a collector's item despite the poor transfer. At least I can compare it to those interested the difference between the two versions in case they want to purchase the Blu-ray.  NOTE: Another indication of the remastered version is a normal WHITE UPC Code on the back of the case, with the \\"2-Disc Set\\" REMOVED above the Paramount Logo.
078322737X|3.0|Just before purchasing this film, I saw it on TV and apparently what I saw was a \\"Director's Cut\\" version. It was very good. Then after seeing the \\"Collector's Edition\\" on DVD, I was left disappointed due to the deletion of certain scenes, which in my opinion were necessary for the fluidity of the film. This version, has also has a couple of scenes that are so dark that it's hard to make out the actors' faces. At the end during the credits a very thin white edge can be seen on the right side, which makes me wonder if I bought a pirate copy or not.<br /><br />The good part about this version is that the music, which is what really makes this film along with all the nostalgia of the early 60s, is clearly recorded and without the obnoxious bass over-boost that is so prevalent in so many re-makes of old films.<br /><br />For a film that costs just a couple of bucks, I can recommend it, but for higher quality, I would have to recommend a different version.
B002ZG997C|4.0|Of the two post-apocalyptic movies released in the last year -- \\"The Book of Eli\\" and \\"The Road\\" -- I think I enjoyed \\"Eli\\" much more.<br /><br />That's because it plays almost like a Twilight Zone episode -- or the first \\"Planet of the Apes\\" movie, written if my memory serves me by Rod Serling -- with a neat twist (or two or three) at the end.<br /><br />\\"Eli\\" is beautifully photographed in bleak shades of brown, and it features an excellent cast, with splendid turns by Denzel as the bad-ass survivor on a sacred mission, Gary Oldman as the villain Carnegie, and Mila Kunis as, well, the eye candy (and eventually Eli's companion on his journey).<br /><br />The fight scenes are topnotch as well, and not too bloody, considering the amount of carnage.<br /><br />I have deducted a star only because of the absence of extras on the DVD.  This practice must stop!  Presumably the studio will release an enhanced version in five or ten years featuring the extras that should have been included from day one.<br /><br />So you might want to rent this or borrow it from your public library first.  And buy it when the \\"deluxe\\" edition finally and inevitably hits the shelves.<br /><br />In conclusion, this is a much better film than the grumpy critics allowed, but my favorites, Ebe and Gliebe (Roger Ebert and Owen Glieberman) liked it, and my faith in the opinions of those esteemed gentleman was again rewarded.

6301986024|4.0|Director Norman Jewison saw visuals in multi-shaped boxes at the 1964 Worlds Fair. Jewison was more of an experimentalist than a stylist, and would try anything once.<br /><br />He used what he saw in the Thomas Crown Affair in 1968. The storyline of the film is straightforward: a millionaire, Steve McQueen, robs for the hell of it and has an affair with a beautiful women, Faye Dunaway.<br /><br />Solid: but Jewison's innovation here pays tenfold. He makes the aforementioned boxes divide the screen. Different shapes, different subplots, different characters--all at once.<br /><br />This is visually stunning. If you can envision those big front window treatments so many split level houses built in the early 1960s had in their fronts--squares and rectangles of different dimensions--this film adopts the same modernist device.<br /><br />Without plot, this would be an indulgence. But Jewison never places style ahead of story here, and so both work beautifully--art and entertainment welded perfect at the hip.

B003XWEQ1G|2.0|First of all i would like to add that if you are going to portray a movie as close as possible to historical accuracy, then you need to be familar with some history pertaining to the Crusades.  King Richard the Lion Heart was away for only 3 years, and therefore Robin longstride(Robin Hood) could not have been in the Crusades for 10 years, unless he was already in the holy land before King Richard arrived.

B0031S4K5E|5.0|I bought this set for my daughter's 6th birthday.  The toy is extremely soft and perfect for a cuddler.  It's just the right size for her to carry around - and she does - EVERYWHERE!

It's colorful, funny, clean and contains a great lesson of how disobeying your parents can cause lots of trouble for not just yourself but others you love too.<br /><br />Great movie and toy - I highly recommend them!
0451147367|5.0|When I found out that the Stephen King short story \\"Rage\\" was taken off the shelves due to the violent content and serious nature concerning school shootings, I knew that I HAD to have a copy.

I'm EXTREMELY happy with my purchase!
B000U0F7RG|5.0|I ordered this product about a year ago and am still enjoying it just as much as I did when it first arrived on my doorstep. The case is very cute and I think certainly something that the Girls would tote along with them. It comes in a plastic box with a handle. When you open the box, there is a cartoon-ish scene on the left of the Girls in their Stars Hollow house. All of the seasons are in individual cardboard folders with a different character on the front of each folder. Some of the reviews mention that the cardboard is flimsy and I have to say that it is not ideal. Still, like the individually sold dvds it comes with an episode guide. I had a bit of a problem with this because the discs are numbered 1-42 but it doesn't state which number episodes are on the disc so you have to go back and forth between the episode guide and the discs to figure out the correct episode and disc that you want. However, the best part of this complete set is the \\"Gilmore-isms\\" book and it makes up for any of the set's deficiencies. In the Gilmoreisms book, it lists almost every pop culture term that is mentioned in the show from A-Z and gives a brief definition. The book has some photos and cartoons and is overall very fun!    Unfortunately, I was one of the buyers who was given a set with some malfunctioning DVDs. Once I called Amazon's attention to this, they immediately sent out brand new (functioning) DVDs to replace the others.    I highly recommend buying this set. I have lugged it across at least five states and played in the DVDs in over six different players and it has held up perfectly!!

0439023483|5.0|I finished reading The Hunger Games and immediately reread it. I didn't want it to end. I really enjoyed the author's imaginative series, Gregor the Overlander, but this story is aimed at slightly older readers and is just a step beyond Gregor. The premise is not so new- young people from different areas are set up in a gladiator style sacrifice/fight to the death that is reminiscent of Logan's Run and The Running Man.  A poverty stricken sixteen year old girl is sent off to the capital city of the country that arose from the ashes of North America, along with a male counterpart.  Katniss doesn't think she stands much of a chance against the \\"career\\" competitors who have trained many years for the glory and honor of battle.  Her skill at foraging and hunting small prey may keep her from starving, but she has no experience with fighting and cannot allow herself to become attached to other players when only one is permitted to exit the arena alive.  The entire event is filmed and all citizens are expected to watch the games.<br /><br />The writing is superb and the details of the challenges she faces are exquisitely presented. I can hardly wait to read the other books in the trilogy.
B00005UOXL|3.0|Billy Idol's debut LP is a classic 80s nugget full of punk/new wave/dance hits, but this remastered CD is NOT the original LP - it's missing the final key track, \\"Congo Man,\\" which itelf is a kind of cool dub mix coda to \\"Love Calling\\" - we all know it was later replaced with the single \\"Dancing with Myself\\" on later versions, but on this deluxe CD reissue, why not reinstate \\"Congo Man?\\" The LP was short to begin with (just over 30 mins), so it could have easily fit - and while they were at it, why couldn't they add on \\"bonus\\" cuts from Billy's U.S.-only debut EP \\"Don't Stop\\" including \\"Untouchables\\" \\"Baby Baby\\" and more - also they could have added in 12\\" mixes/dubes of \\"White Wedding,\\" \\"Hot in the City,\\" \\"Dancing with Myself\\" and \\"Love Calling\\" originally on 12\\" - now THAT would have been a truly complete deluxe CD to do this classic 80s LP justice!  Note: they should also replace the cover with the true original LP cover showing Billy with a Japanese print shirt knotted by to expose his abs - I think the U.S. label feared the original cover photo was too \\"femme/gay\\" so they replaced it with his later \\"Dancing with Myself\\" vest/tattoo shot - again, this only botches the original packaging/content for true Idol fans! Cmon guys - do it right, maybe in 2011?
B000SMWUPS|5.0|We recently purchased a Tike Tech Single City X3 stroller, which has no easily accessible storage, especially for small items like car keys and wallets. But given that my husband and I are complete coffee addicts, the main reason I bought the Buggy Buddy was the cupholders. I hoped against hope that the cupholders would accommodate cups of iced and hot coffee and hold them securely enough to prevent spilling, but I fully expected to be disappointed. Much to my surprise, the Buggy Buddy worked exactly the way I hoped it would. It attaches very securely to the stroller, and even with two heavy drinks in it, the Buggy Buddy doesn't tip. The storage area between the cupholders is the ideal size for all those small items you don't want in your pockets. We're able to collapse the stroller without detaching the Buggy Buddy, and so far, the BB hasn't sustained any damage. This is an extremely well-made item for the price. It has met our needs perfectly.
B00364K6YW|4.0|If you're into Pride & Prejudice as much as I am (Yeh, you know who you are) then you may have every version of the Jennifer Ehle/Colin Firth mini-series available (as do I). This is not about the story or the acting --hello, it's the best!  This is about this particular edition of the work.  I must admit that the color and the digital mastering is engaging.  I couldn't believe that I actually saw things I hadn't noticed before (and I've watched it so many times you can hear the collective groans of my family when the music starts to play). But I was  disappointed with this edition since it follows the mini-series daily chapter breaks (the VHS edition) in lieu of the DVD version where the story flows nearly seamlessly. It would have been a far better value had they digitally colorized that version instead. Bah Humbug!  But for the price, P&P Lovers, it was worth it.  Like I said before, you'll love all the new things you'll see in this much more enhanced version.

B0014I4KH6|3.0|As a habit, any movie, actor, artist, product that is overhyped, I automatically avoid. I get annoyed when someone/something is shoved down my throat and my reaction is to avoid at all costs. I didn't start listening to Taylor's music until maybe two months ago? Surprisingly, it's not all bad. First things first. You have to accept that while she can keep a tune, her voice is not that strong. She has limited range and she sounds very young. With the way all the kids flock to her, I assumed that she was their age (16). I was shocked to find out she's older than that. I'm not sure if her voice will mature as she gets older, but for her sake I hope it does. Prime example is on 'Tim McGraw,' whomever the male voice is, his sound is much fuller and mature than hers. So it makes her sound light-voiced (yes, I made that up). I would imagine that the older she gets, she may end up competing with Carrie, Miranda, Laura, etc for the same fans. She really isn't in the same class as them when it comes to vocals. Don't get me wrong, her music is easy listening, but there's no prowess, no umph. I bought her Soho live album from itunes, and I really can't listen to it often bc you can definitely see the difference btwn her studio voice and her actual voice.     Secondly, the content of the songs are quite young (kinda hard not to pick that up) which is fine for her first album. Simple pop, in my opinion, and not really country. I would never put myself up as a country expert, but she has a very pop sound. My favorite song is Teardrops on My Guitar and that's \\"probably\\" because it doesn't sound *that* young.    All in all, not a bad album. Worth the hype? Well, I don't think so, but it's easy listening in the car or at work.

0141018828|5.0|\\"Philosophy\\" may often seem daunting, a hulking behemoth that one cannot tackle. However, with this version of Marcus Aurelius' 'Meditations', reflections on life, humanity, love, greed, power, and all the things associated with being human are presented succinctly, and written in an accurate and easy-to-understand manner. No archaic sayings or pompous literary acrobatics here.     The book is small, lightweight and thin yet packs so much to reflect upon, that this is a constant travel companion for me. It is definitely a book to read and re-read, and each time, still brings new, refreshing insights. A great source of encouragement and reflection, especially when one is on the road for long journeys.    Don't be put off by the idea of this being a philosophical work. It is highly-accessible, meaningful, and most importantly, READABLE. Get it for yourself, or as a gift. This book is part of a whole series of philosophical works. Try searching for the box set and the other series if you're keen to explore the full collection.    P/S: The letter-pressed cover is pretty darn cool too. Love the design!

0671042858|3.0|This book was not what I expected from Stephen King, one look and hold of the book made me decide that. Its roughly 220 pages, pretty sparse for one if his novels. But I was itching for a new King book after Under the Dome.<br /><br />  I was intrigued by the setting and the beginning of the story, and soon that wavered, and at times I was downright bored. But King has a special way of delivering his stories, he gives his characters a lot of dimensions, he breathes life into them, and none more so than Tricia. She is 9 years old, and it always felt that way. As I was reading this novel, and especially now afterward, I believe she's a real person.<br /><br />  She is quirky, and downright weird sometimes, the way we all are in private. She recalls memories and distorts some, just like we all do. This was my absolute favorite aspect of the book, and it never failed to cheer my up to peer into the mind of this lost 9 year old.<br /><br />  The book is not frightening, nor do I think it tries to be. Although reading the book won't take long, the journey inside it sometimes did. As much as I liked the main character, you got the sense that there really wasn't much to write about or to really progress the story at times.<br /><br />  I must admit I am a huge fan of the very ending, it was truly satisfying for me and made the whole experience worthwhile, however short it was.
B003JTHESA|4.0|Ive known about Iron Maiden for as long as I can remember. I recently purchased The Final Frontier and I was blown away. This is a fantastic album. I am a progressive music fan and this album has some progg traits in it. The music is solid. Satellite 15, The Final Frontier and El Dorado I think are the best.

B003IY47JK|5.0|I stumbled across the music video of  'Frozen' on YouTube and was impressed with both the video and music, so I immediately tracked down this CD online and bought it. Frozen remains my favorite song on the CD, but I found several other favorites such as 'See me in Shadow', 'Shattered', and 'The Gathering'.<br /><br />This album was created with many guest artists from other popular metal bands including names such as Marco Hietala from Nightwish (bass, vocals tracks 1, 4, 7, 8 & 10), Liv Kristine from Leaves' Eyes (vocals tracks 5 & 10), and Sharon Den Adel from Within Temptation (vocals track 4). Charlotte Wessels (Delain's singer) has a lovely voice, and she is the one who sings my favorite songs on this CD and all of the songs in April Rain. If you enjoyed ANY of the songs on this CD, or like artists such as Within Temptation or Nightwish, then I would highly recommend Delain's second CD [[ASIN:B002A4Q652 April Rain]], which is one of my favorite Symphonic Metal CDs. If you like music videos, check out the music video for 'Frozen' on YouTube!
B003HTPHSQ|3.0|Breaking glass. Howling dogs. Bleeding eardrums. These are just a few of the things that come to mind after a listen or two of Cyndi Lauper's uneven new CD MEMPHIS BLUES.<br /> Mind you, it's not that the disc is a BAD album...in fact, musically it merits four stars at the very least. But this isn't an instrumental album, and it's in the area of vocals where things really suffer.<br /> And that's too bad, particularly after the one/two vocal powerhouse punch of 2003'S AT LAST and 2005'S THE BODY ACOUSTIC (We won't mention the giant step backwards taken with BRING YA TO THE BRINK in 2008, which, for me, was all style over substance).<br /> By reverting back much of the time here to her \\"little-girl-on-hellium\\" vocals, Lauper loses all the soul and depth that is required to really sing (i.e. FEEL) the Blues (Nor does shouting count). Consequently, this seems more the work of the performer/character Cyndi Lauper of days gone by vs. the true SINGER that had started to really break thru on the aforementioned AT LAST and THE BODY ACOUSTIC (And, yes, I know Lauper has had some great vocal tracks before those two albums...I just really feel she took it to the next level with these two discs, reinventing herself in the exact way she needed to as she hit her 50's).<br /> Things kick off with the blistering \\"Just Your Fool.\\" Anchored by Charlie Musselwhite's brilliant harmonica playing, the track bops along at an infectious pace. In fact, it's just Lauper's lead vocal that seems to be struggling to keep up with the pack. (Though, I have to admit...I love the line about Jackie Chan!).<br /> Once again, it's the music that shines on \\"Shattered Dreams.\\" Allen Toussaint's piano runs are just stunning, while the horn arrangement is tight and taut. All in all, very nice. Lauper's lead vocal, however, is hollow and by the number. And when she starts wailing near the end....talk about \\"shattered dreams!\\" MAJOR misstep.<br /> The Kewpie Doll vocals actually work on \\"Early In The Mornin'\\"; Lauper comes across as both fun and flirty, sexy and sly. Toss in Toussaint's rippling piano and the joyful guitar and vocal skills of the one and only B.B. King and you have one of the few cuts on MEMPHIS BLUES that feels organic, real and right (vs. gimmicky).<br /> \\"Romance In The Dark\\" has a nice slow, sultry vibe to it...everything just sort of comes together. Lauper's lead vocal is both authentic and honest, while the arrangement is relaxed and smooth. Add some steamy lyrics and you have another one of MEMPHIS BLUES' true winners, a track that works in every way.<br /> \\"How Blue Can You Get?\\" doesn't work quite as well, but it comes close. The arrangement is compact, with the instrumentation spot-on. Jonny Lang's guitar riffs just kill, while his vocals fit right in. In fact, once again it's Lauper's lead vocal that's the only real false note...it's not an awful vocal, but it's not an honest one either. It's almost like she's playing dress-up.<br /> Things rebound a bit on \\"Down Don't Bother Me.\\" Yet again, you have Musselwhite's amazing harmonica front and center, adding something to the arrangement that is beyond priceless. You also have a lead vocal from Lauper that's unforced and true...she's not trying to prove or be anything here, she's just singing for the joy of singing. VERY nice.<br /> \\"Don't Cry No More\\" could have been one of my favorite tracks on the disc, what with it's jumpin' arrangement. Chunky horns, sparkling keyboards, popping percussion....this groove is pop music at it's most perfect. But then....yes, Lauper's vocals come into the mix....shrill, hiccupy and sloppy, it sucks the life right out of an otherwise fantastic cut.<br /> Without a doubt, though, the album's true apex is the rollicking \\"Rollin' And Tumblin'.\\" From Kenny Brown's scorching slide guitar to Amy Lavere's pulsating bass, the instrumentation is amazing throughout. However, it's the vocals that REALLY shine here....Lauper matches duet partner Ann Peebles note for note,with an end result that is nothing short of classic. Now THAT'S how you sing the Blues!!<br /> \\"Down So Low\\" is also in the \\"Winner\\" column. There's something slow and smokey about the arrangement, resulting in a track that just sort of tumbles out of the speakers. Lauper's vocal is O.K., but I wish she had taken it down a notch or two...I think a slightly lower register would have enhanced the track quite a bit more. Still, a nice cut.<br /> We have yet another gem in \\"Mother Earth.\\" All bluesy and boozy, the song just swaggers and slinks along, with Toussaint's piano taking center stage once more (To say the man is astonishing is saying alot, but every syllable would be the truth). Lauper's vocal keeps pace, all assured, authoratative and authentic. MEMPHIS BLUES' sexiest cut.<br /> I would have been happy if things ended there, but the disc actually wraps up with \\"Crossroads.\\" While both Lauper and Jonny Lang turn in respectable performances, the track just isn't as strong, earthy or real as the previous cut. Consequently, the disc closes on a somewhat hollow/shallow, almost forced, note.<br /> And therein lies the main problem with much of MEMPHIS BLUES. While Cyndi Lauper may have mad respect for the greats who paved the way for others, you can't just pull a genre on like you do a tulle head wrap and paper skirt. You need the guts and the voice to do it as well, and Lauper just doesn't. No, I take that back....based on AT LAST, THE BODY ACOUSTIC and numerous cuts over the years,she DOES have the voice. But you also have to FEEL it, vs. ACT it, or it's just so much ill-fitting window dressing, a child playing fantasy dress-up. And Cyndi Lauper's days of dress-up should be well behind her. (As with all my reviews,I'm docking the disc half a star for not including the lyrics. Shame on you, Cyndi...if you really wanted to pay tribute to these classics, well, these words deservrd to be read!).of classic.

B003EYVXTG|5.0|\\"Winter's Bone,\\" adapted from the novel by Daniel Woodrell, is a stark, raw, and gritty masterpiece of storytelling, a thoroughly absorbing detective story that goes above and beyond the reliable conventions of mystery solving. It's a quiet, harsh, and unflinching societal drama set deep within the Ozarks, a world of cold forest lands, small houses that look slopped together from spare parts, cars perpetually hoisted on cinderblocks, and distrustful mountainfolk who all seem to be related to some degree. In these desolate backlands, we find seventeen-year-old Ree Dolly (Jennifer Lawrence), who has taken her mother's place as a homemaker for her younger brother and sister. Her mother is still there, but only in body; her mind is somewhere off the beaten path, having strayed after an emotional trauma she could never come to terms with.    Ree's father, Jessup, was arrested for cooking meth, which seems to be what most people do around these parts. Why? It certainly can't be for the money, considering the abject poverty in which some of them live. Whatever the case, Ree learns from the local sheriff that her father skipped bail and has gone missing. Worse yet, he put his own house up as a way to meet his bond, apparently having no other assets at his disposal. He now has one week to turn himself in. If he doesn't, Ree and her family will be thrown out of the house. Ree, with remarkable understated determination, vows that she will find him. Thus begins a door-to-door manhunt, Ree visiting the homes of Jessup's known associates. It's a journey that will prove more dangerous than it may first seem; these people are just as wary of their own kind as they are of outsiders, perhaps even more so. Family means nothing. It's all about survival.    Ree definitely knows how to survive. She does the best she can with her siblings - feeding them, clothing them, educating them, showing them how to hunt and prepare food with what little she has to work with, including welfare and the occasional helping hand from neighbors. She keeps them as happy as she can, and indeed, they seem unaware of how disadvantaged they truly are. If they are aware of it, then they don't seem all that bothered by it, not as long as they have Ree to keep them in line. So selfless is this young woman that one can't help but wonder where she learned it from. Certainly not from her mother, who can do little more than stare vacantly into the distance, thinking whatever she thinks. I guess some of us are naturally inclined to be self sufficient. Maybe we need more people like her in our lives, if not for friendship, then just for the satisfaction of aspiring to be like her.    As she journeys forward, she crosses paths with her uncle, Teardrop (John Hawkes), a meth dealer who may or may not have something to do with Jessup's disappearance. He's intimidating and mysterious, distrustful and bitter, scarred and hopeless - simultaneously Ree's greatest obstacle and greatest ally in getting to the bottom of things. Hawkes, in the tradition of great actors like Al Pacino and Marlon Brando and even contemporary figures like Johnny Depp and Viggo Mortensen, completely disappears into his role, turning out a flawless balancing act between fearsome and forlorn. Teardrop is a hardened man who I seriously doubt has ever been happy, or at the very least, contented; the words themselves may be foreign concepts to him. Watching him as he progresses with Ree, I was torn between being frightened of him and feeling very sorry.    Jennifer Lawrence, at just nineteen years old, gives one of the year's best performances, and I would be greatly disappointed if she weren't recognized with an Oscar nomination. The determination she brings to her character shows not the slightest trace of conventional Hollywood heroism; she doesn't make herself into a larger-than-life caricature of the strong willed young woman, someone who will sermonize endlessly and make a spectacle of herself. She's an ordinary person in an extraordinary situation. She does what she does not to prove a point, but merely because she has no other choice. Rarely do you see films with characters so convincing, so engaging, so in command of dialogue and emotion.    The film's pacing is superb. The final thirty minutes alone build the kind of suspense that would rival even the best of Alfred Hitchcock's films, Ree's journey having taken a violent turn. It all builds up to a late night boat ride through a swamp, and while I won't reveal what happens, I will say that the scene is frightening in a way that most horror movies could only hope to be. That it's so terrifying is a testament to Anne Rosellini and Debra Granik (the director), who wrote the screenplay in such a way that we can actually feel something for the characters. Without that emotional connection, there would be little for the audience to react to; the film would be a sequence of events, and nothing more. \\"Winter's Bone\\" is a bleak, absorbing, resonant, tightly wound treasure of a film, one of the best I've seen this year.
0061139378|5.0|Coraline's family has just moved into a new flat. Her parents are always busy with their own work and Coraline (please don't call her Caroline) has no friends or siblings to play with. She spends her time exploring her new apartment complex and the surrounding grounds. She's got some eccentric neighbors: two little old ladies who love to reminisce about their time on the stage and an old man who trains mice to sing and dance.<br /><br />But what's really strange is the extra door in Coraline's flat. It doesn't go anywhere. Coraline's mom says it used to connect to the vacant flat next door, but now it's bricked up. Except that it's not always bricked up... sometimes it does go somewhere...<br /><br />Coraline is a terrific little heroine. Curious and brave, but appropriately cautious, she sets out to discover what's in the vacant flat. And though what's there seems rather wonderful at first, Coraline soon realizes that it's actually rather horrible. Not in a bloody gory kind of way, but in a spooky, spine-tingling, why-the-heck-is-this-so-scary kind of way.<br /><br />Neil Gaiman understands creepy: buttons for eyes, long red tapping fingernails, long dark hallways, talking rats, trapped and soulless children... I'm not sure why, but just the thought of an \\"other mother\\" automatically evokes goosebumps -- How incredibly disturbing! The eeriness is accented with excellently terrifying drawings by Dave McKean (who did the Sandman covers).<br /><br />Coraline is excellent fantasy for sensitive but brave children who like to squirm. I read it to my daughters, and I'm sure I squirmed just as much as they did. My girls enjoyed Coraline's adventure and maybe now they'll even be a little less put out when Mommy is too busy to play.
044508376X|1.0|My order arrived as scheduled but the edition itself is disappointing.  The advertised \\"50th Anniversary Edition\\" of Harper Lee's work, To Kill a Mockingbird, is small, measuring only 7\\"x4.\\"  This book, with its worn- looking, discolored pages, rustically bound with red glue, contributes to the impression that it is an old volume  left over from 1982, the date of the first mass marketing edition.  This is not a criticism of the work itself, which I expect to be wonderful.
0439023513|4.0|The final installment of the \\"Hunger Games\\" is not Twilight's Team Edward vs Team Jacob using Katniss, Peeta and Gale instead of Bella, Jacob and Edward.  Nor was the major story arc about a romance set in the backdrop of war (think \\"Gone with the Wind\\").  YA fiction does NOT assume the reader is stupid, or for that matter (take myself for instance) even young.  YA fiction needs characters that YA readers can relate to in some way.  All three books in the \\"Hunger Games\\" does precisely that and more importantly it has YA reading and discussing the characters and storylines.  This fact alone adds a \\"Star\\" in my review. That is not to say \\"Mockingjay\\" had a perfect, pretty ending, but it was a strong one.  No neat bows and ribbons here.  We all know there are no real victors in war even if it is a fictional one.<br /><br />*********************************Spoilers*******************************<br /><br />That said, it was not a \\"5 Star\\" read. Anytime major plot points (such as Prim's death) have numerous readers scratching their heads about whether is really happened or not something is missing. Then an extremely weak, puzzling ending for a major character like Gale.  He was dismissed in a single sentence that simply does not ring true to ALL the previous character development.<br /><br />I felt that SC \\"suggested\\" Katniss was suffering from Post Traumatic Stress Syndrome thus not making her character and decisions weak, but understandable considering all she had endured in the previous two books and this one, so much death surrounds her.  She does not know who to trust.  Katniss knows she is a pawn in a protracted game of political power by Snow and Coin.<br /><br />Her breaking point is Prim's death. Remember Katniss devotion to her little sister is how Katniss came to the Hunger Games.  No one meant more to Katniss than Prim.  Gale's war planning cause Prim's death. Emotionally shellshocked for the rest of her days, Katniss found no joy in being a victor, the Mockingjay.  The personal cost was too great.<br /><br />A realistic, but perhaps not emotionally satisfying portrait, of the effects of trauma,war and death on a young individual.<br /><br />Enjoy the read!oo great.    A realistic, but perhaps not emotionally satisfying portrait, of the effects of trauma,war and death on a young individual.    Enjoy the read!

1400049628|5.0|This is a very well-written \\"survival\\" guide that allows a reader to learn about the \\"fictional\\" characters known as zombies while reflecting on their own ability to prepare for the catastropihc (both literal and metaphorical). It's also just a funny book to read if you like undead beings who wander around trying to kill you.
0316098337|5.0|Good fiction either suspends reality, allowing the reader a mental vacation, or stimulates it, amplifying the world around us. ROOM pulled me in to a place that seemed remote and distant from everyday reality. A child's perspective on a one room world is far from the place most of us dwell. Yet, Jack's sensory experiences are so vivid and focused that when the book was finished I found my own perspectives somehow sharper and alive.<br /><br />Donoghue captures the innocence of youth but in a manner that is not at all as simple as people make children out to be. While the book is simply the perspective of a child, there is a rich undertone that can only be witnessed by maturity. The complexity and brilliance of Jack's mother is masterfully expressed between the lines.<br /><br />A novel narrated completely by a child sounded like something I'd quickly bore of but before I got to a place where I felt I could predict the next turn of events I would be surprised by something new that kept the pace racing along. Definitely a page turner.<br /><br />ROOM heightened my physical senses and my awareness of my immediate surroundings. I also now find myself stretching my neck to see over backyard fences when I take my daily walk. It's not just a quick read that's soon forgotten, Emma Donoghue's ROOM lingers on long after the back cover is closed over.
0156027321|1.0|I waited several years to read this book, and somehow managed to sidestep any knowledge of the \\"plot\\" or ending.  How I wish I'd read the one star reviews here before picking this up.  They sum up my feelings exactly.  This book is the Da Vinci Code of magical realism.  It's a lowest-common-denominator pander to a public desperate for any semblance of spirituality or intellect but unwilling to or incapable of picking up the classics.    I notice that there are a lot of high school students reviewing the book, stating that they had to read it for English class and talking about how deeply spiritual it is.  That's about the level on which the book is written.  It might make me laugh if the fact that English teachers are taking time away from legitimate literature to peddle this drivel weren't so tragic.  Look, I get it... you want the non-reading gruesome video game crowd to get excited about a reading assignment.  But seriously??  This book is so thinly plotted and poorly conceived, not to mention gratuitously violent and disturbing, that I couldn't even take it seriously.    The marketing machine behind it must have been tremendous.  If you're looking for depth rather than dull pseudo-intellectual garbage, I'd look elsewhere.
B002ZG993Q|4.0|George Clooney's latest film, directed by a former music video director Anton Corbijn, is a film that demonstrates effective use of star power: it's unlikely this film would have gotten any attention (and it's still unlikely to be anything huge) without the presence of the King of Hollywood. Clooney's been willing to loan out his starpower to low-profile films in the past, and he does so again here.  This is a slow-burn story more interested in character interiors than \\"Bourne Identity\\"-style action sequences (though it is not devoid of action), one that will probably divide audiences.  But if you're interested in that sort of film, this has a lot to recommend.  Spoilers follow.     The film opens with a prologue in snowy Sweden, where Jack (Clooney) is cottage-going.  There's a twist here that has been spoiled in some reviews, but is most effective when you don't know about it, so I'll refrain from saying anything.  The key is that it sends our assassin title character on a trip to a small Italian town to await his next assignment from his boss, Pavel (Johan Leysen).  Soon, a new assignment arrives, in the form of assistance to another assassin (Thekla Reuten), and legacies of his last mission also begin to appear.   Whiile there Jack ponders the state of his life, sort-of-befriends a priest (Paolo Bonacelli), and starts to fall in love with a really, really luscious prostitute (Violante Placido).     It's familiar material, but it's played well. The director knows how to use the camera effectively, positioning it in ways that keep the audience on guard for something about to happen.  If I came away with a single impression, it was a strong desire to visit the town in which this was filmed, because it looks stunning.  Clooney really dials down his charisma here (like he did in \\"Syriana\\"), and gives an effective performance. The other actors, mainly Italians, are all effective, particularly Placido, who really sells the idea that our lead character would want to give up his old lifestyle to live with her (and she's very attractive - this is a movie prostitute who actually takes her clothes off). The mark of a good movie is when they can really interest you in the mechanics of the character's profession: we get some long sequences of Clooney at work on his guns, and it's interesting to watch (particularly constructing a sound supressor out of parts from an auto shop).    Recommended.

B0015DROBO|1.0|Mindless trash.<br />This is not a book.  It is at best an outline for a BAD book.<br />Reminds me of a joke.  A fellow comes to a publisher and says, \\"I want to be a writer\\".  The publisher looks him over and asks, \\"Have you read much?\\"  The fellow answers, \\"But I do not want to be a reader.  I want to be a writer!\\"  This could have been about Larsson.<br /><br />Characters?  They have no personality.  Two dimensional cardboard cut outs.  The reader has not a clue what motivates them, what makes them tick.<br /><br />Mystery?  The prologue all but gives away the store.  Reader's first guess at \\"solution\\" proves to be correct.<br /><br />Story?  One could drive a truck through the holes.  A girl who can hack into bank accounts of a powerful industrialist and rob him blind has to submit to sexual extortion because she needs a few thousand kroner of her own money?  A girl who can hack any computer cannot alter her state records forcing her to be dependent on unscrupulous (and otherwise) lawyers and bureaucrats?  Give me a break!

But Not Afraid is one of his best songs of all time, which says a lot.    Too bad his politics are still messed up. Obama is a disaster, in over his head, a socialist. Eminem, are you willing to give up 55% to this man? After all, he wants it. You will not get it back.     The final song is amazing as well. This is Eminem at his lyrical best.      Love the Way you Lie is also part of his Cannon.

I look up the amount of pages on this one to make sure it's not the large print one & all, and the page count is similar to the first 2 of the series in paperback.<br /><br />So, I'm like, \\"Great!  I'll pay the extra money for it because it's worth it.\\"  Yea, right!  This book is enormous in size, like a college textbook.  You're better off either buying the US hardcover, or just waiting for the newer paperback version.  I was feeling bad for my skinny lady because this book made her purse way heavier.<br /><br />SHE SAID IT'S A GREAT BOOK, but I wouldn't suggest buying this edition because of the size.  Stick with the hardcover one for now.
B003ODL004|5.0|Hans Zimmer continually amazes me... Each and every score is an exercise in balance, moderation and sound design. \\"Inception\\" is perhaps the most impressive I've heard from the maestro in several years. Although the score is quite minimalist, it's incredibly complex in the emotions it evokes. I don't know whether to cry, immerse myself in imagination or ponder the universe around me. It's deep on so many levels that it literally takes dozens of listens to form a cohesive emotion from the music. My current emotional response to it is an overwhelming urge to create.. to delve deeper in the abyss of my mind and soul. Perhaps that is \\"Inception\\"'s greatest asset, its ability to plant itself wherever it pleases... we just have to push play.
0307476154|4.0|I found the first book in the serious tedious because of all the background information needed to set the book up but once into it(about 200 pages) then it was good. So I purchased this book the 2nd in the series & this was great. VERY interesting & a real page turner.
B002KREVCO|5.0|As an AC/DC fan it's the live one from this set that really recommends this set.  The live tracks on \\"Bonfire\\" are great as is the quasi-greatest hits collection \\"Live,\\" but the sampler platter here that combines rare live performances from both the Bon Scott and Brian Johnson eras is better because they picked out the best ones rather than used the tapes of a single complete concert.  Also, live versions of Johnson-songs like \\"Guns for Hire,\\" \\"This House Is on Fire\\" and \\"Safe in New York City\\" that aren't just the big famous ones are cool to have.  Five big stars.
0439023513|1.0|What. The. Fudge?!  I'm going to skip my comments on the middle and on the horribly slow, unrealistic and upsetting plotline and skip straight to the end.  *SPOILERS*  I was waiting for this book to come out for MONTHS. And now I'm ashamed I read it, because it ruined the WHOLE series for me. I can no longer enjoy the Hunger Games trilogy because of this crap-tastic ending. Too many characters are killed off, Katniss is dead inside and yet she makes up very bluntly with Peeta and there's an ending that leaves you numb, and Gale, who I always wanted her to end up with, wasn't even her friend in the end. He just went to district 2, like Katniss never existed.  */SPOILERS*  DO NOT READ THIS BOOK. If you value your love for this series (and I loved the first two books. They were fantastic and fun to read.), your love will go sour if you read this. It's not enjoyable/satisfactory, it's slow, it leaves too many loose ends, you feel numb at the end, and the writing is just plain sloppy and especially tacky and too blunt near the end. I can honestly say I wish I had never read this book, and I'm ashamed that it's laying next to me right now (only after I swore and threw it on the ground, of course).   So...yes. Just save yourself the sadness and disappointment and don't read this.
B002ZG97EC|5.0|This is one of the best children's movies to come out in quite some time!
B0036EH3U2|5.0|I watched and loved the cheesy original \\"Battlestar\\" as a kid -- yes, even the wretched \\"Galactica: 1980\\" -- but the reimagined Battlestar Galactica is another beast altogether. It grabs you by the throat with the original miniseries and never lets you go. Yes, it's about killer robots, but don't let that fool you into an easy dismissal of this show. It won a Peabody Award for its gritty portrayal of a handful of humans desperately trying to survive. Even the United Nations took notice of this brilliant series. Shouldn't you?
0316067938|4.0|I'm an Austin and Shakespear fan. The characters have me hooked!!! The plot of the love story is as good as Austins. But I think they have the mark of a first time author and could have had more editing. But I would still buy more. I see the author maturing in her writing of \\"The Host\\". I will follow Stephenie Meyer as long as she publishes. Good read for the young and young at heart.
B001F6ZIXC|5.0|This is by FAR one of the best series I've ever seen.<br />Great story lines, great acting, great special effects.<br /><br />Altogether....GREAT.  Wouldn't miss an episode for the world!!!
B00014NE62|5.0|A CLASS LOOK AT BEING GAY IN THIS TIME----SUPER(MASTERPIECE THEATER) BRITISH PRODUCTION.....I came out in 60\\"s and bars were like speak-easy--little peep window and all.....THE WORLD HAS MATURED TREMENDOUSLY<br /><br />I recommend for straight and gay audiences....<br /><br />\\"NOT PORNOGRAPHIC\\"<br /><br />in the BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN manner----all anyone wants is love
B001GAPC1K|5.0|Well the seller was very fast and professional very good description and very accurate to the condition of the blue ray video.  Will do business again soon.
B002N5N5QQ|5.0|I wasn't so sure about this show when it first came out, I've been around and am familiar with the MC life and I was a little weary that tv would find a way to screw this up, but after hearing my father talk about the show so much, I finally gave it a shot...and wished I would've sooner, it's a great show, well written and acted. Series creator Kurt Sutter did a genius job at creating a show with many different elements to bring the characters to life. It's nice to see Katey Sagal in a dramatic roll, I feared she wasn't going to be seen as anything else but Peggy Bundy, so it was great to see her kicking some ass.  Ron Perlman  is great as always, Charlie Hunnam was a good cast choice as Jackson \\"Jax\\" Teller. I first saw him in Green Street Hooligans and thought he has talent. All in all, Sons Of Anarchy is worth watching, so if you haven't see it yet, you have to give it a shot, I can not wait for season 3...gonna get even better.                     -J
0060090383|3.0|Since reading Watermelon, I was looking forward to reading Rachel's Holiday.  The story about Rachel and her life was a good one, but the book was very long.  It followed Rachel while she was in rehab and what happened when she got out.  I really thought it could have been cut in half.  After a while I got tired of reading about the tons of people in the rehab clinic with Rachel and just wanted to read about her.  There were so many of them it was getting hard to keep track of everyone.  The book kept me interested by adding in little past bits about Rachel as the book went on, but towards the end I was so tired of reading about the same thing and wanted the book to end.  I started skimming wanting to be done with it.  I was excited to read some about Claire from the Watermelon, but there wasn't a ton about her.      Thankfully the ending was worth reading, but could have come 200 pages soon.  If the ending hadn't been worth reading I would have given the book 2 stars.  It was boring at times and dragged on.  I liked Rachel's story, but everyone else's could have been cut out and the book would have been just as good or better.

B0036TGSR6|1.0|Offered here for our disapproval is a contemptible former British Prime Minister, a revisionist's Tony Blair amorally in bed with a mistress and with the evil U.S. in its war vs. terrorism. This one-dimensional character's alleged \\"crime against humanity\\" was the rendering of a couple of British Islamic terror suspects to the diabolical CIA for interrogation. A suspect dies in custody. While not presented as the cause of death, waterboarding is mentioned repeatedly and becomes a focal point of this story's self-righteous wrath.     It is a matter of debate whether waterboarding, which produces plenty of physical and psychological stress but causes no physical harm, is torture. Yet this \\"crime\\" is judged in the movie's court of public opinion by anti-war zealots and media without the movie offering an opposing viewpoint.     A more intellectually honest script would have presented the moral dilemma between the wartime pursuit of mass murderers whose main tactic is targeting civilians vs. preserving the civil liberties that such pursuit endangers. These worthy and sometimes-conflicting endeavors deserve at least cursory examination here. Just a few lines among the PM's own inner circle explaining to the audience his rationales could suffice. The most we get is the PM's brief and shallow statement about the \\"defense of freedom,\\" intentionally presented to us as a vapid media sound bite. His cooperation is simplistically presented as definitional evil as if no justification could possibly exist.    It is that one-sided presentation of a clearly controversial matter that makes this movie as propagandistic as if it were approved for public consumption by the Iranian Supreme Court. It assumes unquestioning agreement by the audience of its central theme -- that waterboarding is torture and a crime against humanity. That may be a \\"fact\\" to the anti-war crowd, but not to us all, and it's a lie to present it as such.
0316098337|5.0|Jack is the narrator of `Room'.  Jack is excited by his fifth birthday, is curious about the world and full of energy.  But Jack's physical world is contained within an 11 by 11 foot space called Room where he and his Ma live.  This is Jack's world: the room and its contents, and his mother.  Because we are viewing this world through Jack's eyes, we are protected in part from his mother's awful reality.  Jack recounts what he sees and experiences and the reader knows the situation that Jack and his Ma are in.  But Jack does not: this is his life and this is the only world he knows.<br /><br />In Jack's world, he has songs and stories.  He has a snake made from egg shells, and a maze made from toilet roll inserts.  He has the unreal world of television which he sometimes watches in unlimited amounts when Ma doesn't get out of bed.  For Jack, these are the days `when Ma is gone'.<br /><br />One day Ma tells Jack that there is a world outside Room.  And this becomes the beginning of another story, one which is best read uninfluenced by reviews and story synopses.<br /><br />I added this book to my reading list because it is on the Man Booker 2010 longlist.  I had some misgivings about reading it given the subject matter but once I started reading it, I couldn't put it down.  I would have found it unbearable if it was written from the perspective of Ma.  Our view, through Jack's eyes, is more focussed on the relationship between son and mother than on the situation itself.  The book ends, but the story isn't over.<br /><br />It's like a crater, a hole where something happened.'<br /><br />Jennifer Cameron-Smith
0143034901|5.0|I had never heard of the author or the book, but took a chance. I am so glad that I did. It is well written AND entertaining. I didn't find myself wishing I were an editor the way I do with so many other so called acclaimed books. This book is definitely worth your time.
0316067938|5.0|This book was everything that I expected and more.  There were a couple of plot twists that bothered me.  This was the only book where I didn't hate Bella as much for the decisions that she made.  In this book she became the hero and I really love the love story with Edward.  I only wish that they would have casted a better person to portray Edward.  Robert Pattinson doesn't do it for me, but I am 39.  The Edward in my mind is handsome and warm.  I gave it 5 stars despite my dislike of the crazy story line twists.  It resolves eventually letting me accept those twists in the end.  This series was my favorite romance of all time.  I loved it.  I usually don't read vampire books or such easy reads or even romance novels, but this one was very different and I'm thankful that my friend recommend this series.
1433502410|1.0|I have two major problems with the English Standard Version of the Bible. The first is the deletion of 17 entire verses and approximately 33,000 words (yes, you heard me right!) from the New Testament alone. I am not a King James only Christian (although I do use and believe that the King James is an excellent translation of the Bible) and while many of these deletions may appear minor, in truth there are no major deletions when we are talking about G-d's Word. Here are the 17 whole verses deleted from the Holy Scriptures.     Matthew 12:47 'Then one said unto him, Behold, thy mother and thy brethren stand without, desiring to speak with thee.'  Matthew 17:21 'Howbeit this kind goeth not out but by prayer and fasting.'  Matthew 18:11 'For the Son of man is come to save that which was lost.'  Matthew 23:14 'Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye devour widows' houses, and for a pretence make long prayer: therefore ye shall receive the greater damnation.'  Mark 7:16 'If any man have ears to hear, let him hear.'  Mark 9:44 'Where their worm dieth not, and the fire is not quenched.'  Mark 9:46 'Where their worm dieth not, and the fire is not quenched.'  Mark 11:26 'But if ye do not forgive, neither will your Father which is in heaven forgive your trespasses.'  Mark 15:28 'And the scripture was fulfilled, which saith, And he was numbered with the transgressors.'  Luke 17:36 'Two men shall be in the field; the one shall be taken, and the other left.'  Luke 22:44 'And being in an agony he prayed more earnestly: and his sweat was as it were great drops of blood falling down to the ground.'  Luke 23:17 'For of necessity he must release one unto them at the feast.'  John 5:4 'For an angel went down at a certain season into the pool, and troubled the water: whosoever then first after the troubling of the water stepped in was made whole of whatsoever disease he had.'  Acts 8:37 'And Philip said, If thou believest with all thine heart, thou mayest. And he answered and said, I believe that Jesus Christ is the Son of God.'  Acts 15:34 'Notwithstanding it pleased Silas to abide there still.'  Acts 24:7 (note half of Acts 24:6 and 24:8 is also removed) 'But the chief captain Lysias came upon us, and with great violence took him away out of our hands,'  Acts 28:29 'And when he had said these words, the Jews departed, and had great reasoning among themselves.'  Romans 16:24 'The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you all. Amen.'    In addition to these 17 deleted verses, sadly there are many other deletions that effect important Christian doctrines such as the Trinity. 1 John 5:7 in the King James version reads 'For there are three that bear record in heaven, the Father, the Word, and the Holy Ghost: and these three are one. And there are three that bear witness in earth, the Spirit, and the water, and the blood: and these three agree in one.' 1 John 5:7 in the ESV reads 'For there are three that testify: the Spirit and the water and the blood; and these three agree.' While these deletions and changes may appear minor to many, the integrity of G-d's Word is not a minor issue as the Scriptures close with a solemn warning which was sadly ignored by the ESV translators. 'And if any man shall take away from the words of the book of this prophecy, God shall take away his part out of the book of life...' (Revelation 22:19) There are many, many more examples that I could demonstrate including such fundamental issues such as the words to the 'Our Father' prayer. The King James Version in Luke 11:2 states 'And he said unto them, When ye pray, say, Our Father which art in heaven, Hallowed be thy name. Thy kingdom come. Thy will be done, as in heaven, so in earth.' while the ESV deletes many words and translates the same verse 'And he said to them, \\"When you pray, say: \\"Father, hallowed be your name. Your kingdom come.'     Another problem with the ESV is the hundreds of changes that incorporate gender inclusive language. For instancein Romans 3:28 the King James Version reads 'Therefore we conclude that A MAN is justified by faith without the deeds of the law' whereas the ESV translates 'For we hold that ONE is justified by faith apart from works of the law.' Again this is just one of hundreds of examples where the ESV neuters the masculine language to be gender inclusive. Because of these changes (in addition to the thousands of deletions from Holy Scripture), I cannot recommend the ESV, just for the sake of finding an easier read then the King James Version. Our responsibility is to read G-d's Word, not to change and delete it's original meaning. The Church for 1900 years accepted the 17 verses that I listed above as Holy Scripture, so with what right does the ESV take them away? I don't understand how people can read and watch the plays of Shakespeare in this educated age and yet complain about the majestic language of the King James Version. At least with the King James Version you are showing respect to G-d's message by printing all of it and not incorporating gender inclusive language for the sake of political correctness.
B002VPE1B6|5.0|This movie delivers actually what you would hope for.  It's engaging, dazzling, and warm and fuzzy.  I can understand how it received a four star rating on the whole, as it isn't a masterpiece along the lines of Gone with the Wind.  I liked it quite a bit, though, and I thought the storyline was strong.  A few of the scenes involving flying on the back of giant reptiles are inspiring, and the actors all handled their roles well.  It may not be a 5 star production to most, but I can't think of a single way they could have improved this one.
B001R7IHA0|5.0|After listening to some of Keith Urban's videos on CMT, had to include his ability and songs on my growing list of \\"country\\" music!
B002UXRGM0|4.0|I am on the last disk of the series. It's very good, high quality video, good narration. My only complaint is the dvds do seems short. I'm not sure how many hours of actual footage there is, but they do play fast. I still believe it's a great addition to my collection, and if this helps pay for future documentaries from BBC, it is well worth the investment and contribution.
B000WQW988|5.0|An amazing show.  You need to see this even if you're not a Nirvana fan.
B003QZ5222|5.0|Mini LPs are on heavy card stock, nicely done.  No individual booklets but there is a booklet included with all the cover art and track listings.  Copyright is 2010.  No indication about the remastering but I found the CDs to be sound better than the original CDs.    The River is a double gatefold.   The box that this comes in is very sturdy.  I was impressed.  I prefer the mini LPs to the standard old jewel cases with the disc logo in the right hand corner.  Nice upgrade, especially for Nebraska and The River.
1594488843|4.0|In his newest installment, Pink tackles motivation, tracing its evolution and, using a software analogy, asserting the need for a radically new way of looking at the topic, which he dubs Motivation 3.0.  Practiced by Type I leaders, it relies on autonomy, mastery and purpose to get results. Many of the ideas on which he bases his premise are not new - we've known that the old carrot and stick are not particularly effective in the 21st century - but Pink does give us plenty to think about.  He also presents ideas that will make some readers bristle.  Does your organization pay employees to spend 20% of their time on whatever they want instead of on the work at hand?  Whether you can agree with everything he supports or not, Pink uses interesting life stories and research studies to support the case for a new way of motivating others.
0439023513|2.0|I'll try to speak in generalities here about my disappointment so this review can actually give you some info before you buy.  After the first two books, of -course- Mockingjay was a preorder.  But I have to say this is a big let down.  I don't suppose I could have resisted reading it, but the resolution Suzanne Collins chose for her characters is a big let down.    I don't mind books being depressing.  Heck, one of my favorite books is Heros Die. The world created here is fundamentally distopian. But stories should be depressing in a compelling way that stirs the emotions.  The characters had plenty of raw emotional material to work with, but it just fizzled. I think it's okay to let your characters spend some time being dazed and confused about what they want, what they should do, how to prevail, etc etc.  However Katniss never progresses beyond this state.  She fumbles her way to the end of the book.    Along the same lines, the romantic resolution is a total cop out.  It's inconsistent with previous characterization and completely glossed over.      Maybe life happens like this sometimes, but it doesn't make for good reading.
B001ILFUDC|4.0|Not one of my favorite Disney movies but still enjoyable. I collect Disney movies so I bought this as part of that. I watched it after years of never watching it. It is a decent Disney but not a favorite. Nice that is was brought of the vault!
B002Q9VPFM|4.0|Great movie but I have two problems. 1: The motion comic discs are obviously recycled and they didnt bother being careful unwrapping it and shoving it in this edition. 2: When trying to remove the cardboard card, the stickers holding it on tore the front
B0034JKZ3G|5.0|I love the combo pack! I am able to watch the movie in different locations based on system available. Nice and flexible. The picture quality is great on the BluRay and even the DVD. I can't say for sure about the digital copy, as I have not watched that one. It was great price for all 3 movies- would have cost alot more to buy seperatly. Disney is harly ever on sale in the store so buying it here was a buy!!
1593082800|5.0|I love this book! Not only did it arrive on time, but in near perfect condition!
0765326353|5.0|While it is true, according to some reviewers, that the first part of the book is a little slow, BS makes up for it by the middle of the book.  And while slow, the setting is so interesting and massive that I have to put the book down every once in a while to take all of it in.   BS doles out little tidbits that kept me interested enough to go forward and by the midway point I was completely hooked.  This series is going to change the face of fantasy, like Robert Jordan and George RR Martin did before him.
B000A2WNB2|2.0|There is no mention of restricted viewing for the U.S. I was not able to view this DVD on my DVD player-a message saying my area prohibits the viewing of this DVD. But, I was able to view it on my laptop. But,it's still abit inconvenient. And, I wished there was a warning of this possible occurence-I may not have purchased it had I known.
0060730552|5.0|I read this book after watching the movie by the same name. Movies never can give you all the details in the way books can. This book is about two men that climb a mountain together and one breaks his leg on the mountain and they have to figure out how to get back down but in the process they get stuck in a predicament and one buddy has to cut the rope and his friend falls into a crevasse, thinking him dead he works at getting himself back to camp. The buddy is not dead, Joe Simpson the author is that man, stuck in the crevasse with a broken leg and no food water or a way out, he lowers himself further in,taking more guts than most who would just sit and wait for death. This is where the story really got interesting to me, his tortured journey and will to live, his voice in his head that keeps him moving, really a great story and amazingly true. I wish he would have told more about the way his brain behaved during that time, the way memories came back, songs played out, quotes remembered, the voice, just fascinating stuff, excellent book. Will be reading more from this author.
B0039ZF8D2|5.0|I must admit that when I first heard about this collaboration album with Nas and Damian Marley. I kind of forgot about it quickly. In an era where marketing money dictates what songs and albums get attention and what songs and albums don't. It's real easy for any artist or project to kind of get lost in the shuffle. Radio kind of plays 10 to 15 artists and most of it is based on the type of money that is spent by the labels.     I just recently purchased this album and I must say that this is a true masterpiece.From start to finish. Damian Marley and Nas make beautiful music together. Two outstanding lyricists with great style and great substance.    As a music fan, You are really doing yourself a disservice if you don't at the very least listen to a song on this album called \\"Patience\\". The song itself is deep. The lyrics are extremely clever and meaningful.  Damian Marley channels his father in a way, I feel like he never has before. His dad would have been proud.
0811876373|4.0|I love the idea of cake pops. i love the ring bound book and the pictures of the cake pops .. too cute. My teensy problem is the TEXT. The text is so small that I have a hard time reading it, especially with the glare of the glossiness of the pages.  I do wear glasses and have no problems with other books/kindle/etc so I am pretty sure it's just the text is too small. some of the text is white on pastel colors some is a grey on green, some is just black on white.. it all seems pretty difficult to read. The recipes themselves have some bigger/bolded text which is okay.<br /><br />I don't fault the content, it's great (what I can read).. perhaps I'll get good at making them w/o reading the instructions...

B001HN69AY|4.0|I saw many previews of this film and choose to see it because one does not see that many movies in this genre.  It is an adult fairy tale on what is means to us to have our imaginary world once we are no longer children.  Dr. Parnassus has a traveling theatre and he has been living on the fringes of society.  His companions are his 16 year old daughter, a young actor Anton and a midget that is sort of his best friend/conscience.<br /><br />But Dr. Parnassus also has a secret.  He has made a deal with the devil and their mind game seems to be never ending.  Things would be better if their wagers concern only two of them - but that is not the case.  Both devil and Dr. Parnassus are risk takers and gamblers and they take no prisoners.  Everyone is a fair game.<br /><br />There is also a fantastic cast of actors that includes late Heath Ledgers, Johhny Depp, Jude Law and Colin Ferrell; not to mention Christopher Plummer.  I truly liked gypsy-like costumes and interior of their traveling caravan.  Their are some parts that are quity witty in the film but at times story seems to be dragging on and that is why I gave it only 4 stars.<br /><br />It is also difficult to watch this film and not reflect to the fact that this is Heath Ledger's last film before his tragic death.  I found myself looking at his face and eyes for tales and signs of personal struggle.  He looks tired and rugged that fits his role, but his performance is just as sublime as it can possibly be.<br /><br />Definitely not a movie that will fit everyone's taste - but I liked it because it is sincerely original.

B0034G4OU4|1.0|I was shocked to see that Elizabeth Gilbert's nauseating twaddle, EAT PRAY LOVE was being made into a movie.  Even more shocked to see Julia Roberts in the lead.  But I always enjoyed her comedies, so I was hopeful she might turn the poor excuse for a memoir into a comedic film.  I was so wrong.  The movie just might be even more shallow than the highly-touted-by-Oprah (another reason to avoid the book) supposed \\"memoir.\\"  Italy was sterotypically portrayed (lots of pasta and Italians who don't seem to have a care in the world) India and the ashram were also pretty unbelievable, even Richard Jenkins, a strong character actor, could not redeem that segment, and Bali, where no one's home has walls...really?  Do only ex-pats live in Bali?  Oh, and there is a very unconvincing story awkwardly woven into the movie about a single Balinese mom with a mission to help others for whom Ms. Gilbert supposedly raises a ridiculous amount of money so the woman can build a home with floors covered in little pretty blue tiles.  The only \\"real\\" moment in the film came when Felipe (Javier Badem) is saying good-bye to his 19-year old son and tearfully tells him that a week together is just not enough time.  Having raised 2 children, I could relate to his pain.  But that was the only authentic part of the movie.  As for the man she visits in Bali, her healer?  who reads her palm? Two of my friends traveled to Bali and actually sought him out.  Guess what?  He told both of them the same thing he told Elizabeth!  \\"You will live a long life and have 2 husbands.  The second husband will be your true love/soul mate,\\" blah blah blah.  Julia Roberts was boring, she smiled too much, she wept with no tears, she had a wardrobe that would never have fit in that dirty duffel bag she was hauling around and her dialogue had no soul.  But then, neither did Gilbert's book. Even Neil Young's music could not help this film. If you like experiencing someone else's self-indulgent behavior and whining, this movie (and the \\"memoir,\\" a word I use loosely here) is for you.  However, if you have a whit of sense about you, you will avoid it.movie (and the \\"memoir,\\" a word I use loosely here) is for you.

0439023513|5.0|I did not immediately see the connection between the Hunger Games trilogy and Theseus and the Minotaur, but once the comparison was made...  It was like I was looking at two faces and suddenly saw the candlestick between.  This trilogy is beautiful.  In a way, it's more adult fiction than teen, especially as it moves through Mockinjay, but that's only because of the power of the first two books.  It's like the old author cliche, \\"the story just writes itself.\\"  I don't see how the questionable content of Mockinjay could have been removed without making the story too much to swallow.<br /><br />I enjoyed Collins's Overlander series, but they were like Goosebumps compared to Poe or Lovecraft when I compare them to the Hunger Games Trilogy.  It's Katniss's humanity that makes this so real.  Having just finished the last book, I'm left with the echoes of the story in my chest like when I choose to watch Saving Private Ryan again.<br /><br />Strongly recommended.
0316044938|4.0|So what can I say that hasn't already been said? Probably nothing.. I did feel this book was perhaps a little over-hyped. It was good, but as good as 3,000 + people giving it a 4 out of 5 stars on Amazon?? Probably not THAT good.     I felt the first few chapters were wonderfully written, suspenseful, and thrilling, but after a while, things sorta fell flat for me. I don't understand what happened. Maybe it was the number and oddity of the characters Sebold wove into the story. I know it is a work of fiction, but I love a book that retains at least some believability to the essence of its characters, even if the plot itself is fantastical. I think Susie's family was well-thought out, and their actions and behaviors were realistic & meaningful enough.. it was just the secondary characters that bothered me. For example, I still don't see the point in Ray Singh's mother's character. Was she put into the story just to prove a point that Jack Salmon's determination and will was strong enough to avoid the same temptations that his wife fell to with Detective Fenerman?? Maybe that was it..    Also, the scene where Susie's \\"spirit\\" takes over Ruth's physical body? That was a little much, and almost unbearable to read. I guess most of my discontent stems from the way Sebold chose to end (or not end) the story.. I know this is entirely a matter of personal preference, but once I finished the book, I was sort of left feeling like those few hours of my life were wasted, and I rarely feel that way after reading a book. It's not that I'm an optimist whatsoever. My favorite author is Richard Matheson.. king of tragic endings! But, I just didn't feel any \\"closure\\" with this book. I didn't see the point or meaning behind the story & the way Sebold chose to not tie up the loose ends. But.. perhaps that IS the point - that some things in life, happy or sad, have no meaning. And that's just the nature of life & reality.    Maybe I'll give the book 4 out of 5 stars after all!

0439023513|4.0|I am a tremendous fan of Ms. Collins and her writing style and books. This series is one of the mmost riveting, can't put down stories. While I liked the book and how it dealt with the different relationships and story lines, I felt that it was too rushed and not executed well.  She concludes all story lines to a certain extent leaving room for a spin off of other characters if so desired.  What I wasn't too thrilled about was the fact that it left some unanswered questions.  I did not like the lack of closure for Gale and Katniss, while I understand the conclusion the result was lacking.  I also felt that the end should have had more body and time devoted as opposed to the beginning scenes which felt a little long and drawn out leaving the end short and choppy.  This being said, I would still highly reccommend this book and series, as I have done already, to anyone but can not give a full 5 stars.

B002G1YPH0|5.0|Lots of hard research went into this, and after gathering all the information I could, I've come up with the following:<br /><br />- Idle's at 25c OC'd (24c with two fans). Now let me explain. I'm using Arctic Silver between the copper base and the top of my AMD Phenom II X2 550 Black Edition. This chip normally runs at 3.1GHz, and I have it overclocked to 3.72GHz. I used to have unlocked cores so it was a Quad Core running at 3.6GHz/core, but after you do that, you can't test the temps (unreadable). Not even gonna worry about the temps on quad core if the OC'd dual core is running 25c with only ONE FAN (the one it came with to boot!).<br /><br />-  Lowest temps rock 22c. Running Prime95 stress tests for a half an hour, and I couldn't get it to even break a sweat past 31c. THIRTY-ONE DEGREES CELSIUS. My last fan idled at 34c. WTF. XD<br /><br />- Install was fairly straight-forward. Study those small tutorial pictures included hard. It'll save you some time if you've never done a backplate kind like this before (me). Heh.<br /><br />***- Rocking Photoshop CS5 + Chrome (5 tabs) + Firefox (3 tabs) + MediaMonkey (playing music) + Watching an HD video in VLC player + working in M$ Word, AND running a virus scan with Avast! = Temp rises 1c to a \\"working temp\\" of 26c. Holy... effing... yeah - that should give you a very good idea of what this heat sync is capable of.<br /><br />Here's my general rig, and how I got my temps this low:<br /><br />- My case is the Cooler Master Storm Sniper. This case pushes massive air quietly with 3x 200mm fans, and a 140mm fan on the bottom. The ONE fan on the Hyper 212 Plus is keeping the temps at 25 idle.

B003TEO3EI|5.0|Ah, another 3-4 year wait, another Blind Guardian studio release.  My own discovery of Blind Guardian was courtesy of a mixed tape someone gave me during law school, during the dark years for American metal fans in the mid-90s, before ordering CDs from metal distribution channels online became an everyday, reliable process.  I remember hearing \\"Born In A Mourning Hall\\", and saying, \\"what the @#$@! is this?\\"  It sounded like someone mashed up Metallica and Queen, with one of the Four Horsemen and his army being brought in for vocals.  As a result, while many fans cite \\"Nightfall in Middle Earth\\" as their favorite, for me, \\"Imaginations From the Other Side\\" has been the gold standard for the band, due to its incredibly raw, yet massive sound.  \\"Nightfall\\" was where the band suddenly toned down the in-your-face, thrashy rhythm guitars and subdued the drums, and emphasized the guitar leads and vocals instead.  As a result, while the band has consistently put out outstanding albums, it seems their musical direction has veered away from the visceral immediacy they championed on \\"Imaginations\\", and relied more on their melodic elements.      \\"A Night At the Opera\\" divided fans even more, as songs such as \\"The Maiden and the Minstrel Knight\\" and the sprawling epic \\"And Then There Was Silence\\" brought in further emphasis on elaborate orchestration, while other songs such as \\"Sadly Sings Destiny\\" and \\"Wait For An Answer\\" strove to integrate a more \\"modern pop\\" element into their metal songwriting.  2006's \\"A Twist In the Myth\\", meanwhile found the band on uncertain footing, as it was the first album without founding drummer Thomen Stauch.  The songs were more concise and straightforward, but despite the presence of such stand-outs as \\"Otherland\\", \\"Turn the Page\\", and \\"Straight Through The Mirror\\", it was considered a relative disappointment (although it speaks volumes that an album as good as it was is called \\"disappointing\\" compared to Blind Guardian's other albums).  Say what you may about it, but \\"Twist\\" did showcase a return of the rhythm section into the audio mix.    So now we come to \\"At The Edge of Time\\", which starts off with the heavily orchestrated \\"Sacred Worlds\\", which is, in my opinion, the band's best lead-off track to an album in years.  It seems that for years, the band has been loathe to showcase a strong track as the album opener; \\"Imaginations From the Other Side\\", \\"Into the Storm\\", and \\"Precious Jerusalem\\" may all have been far from bad tracks, but they never seemed to really grab me the way that an opening track should.  This album opens with one hell of a left hook, although a couple moments of the 1st minute skirt dangerously close to the territory of Dream Theater's unintentionally awful orchestral intro to \\"Six Degrees of Turbulence\\".  Luckily, if the listener perserveres through this close call with bad Disney-metal symphonics, the orchestration settles into a truly epic state of mind, and the chorus simply soars when it kicks in.      The album never quite settles into any kind of a rut, as the band cranks through fast, thrash/speed/power metal numbers (\\"Tanelorn\\", \\"Ride Into Obsession\\", \\"Voice in the Dark\\"), more mid-tempo, complicated dark numbers (\\"Road of No Release\\", \\"Control the Divine\\"), Middle-Eastern-influenced prog-metal (\\"Wheel of Time\\"), and sweeping balladry (\\"War of the Thrones\\").  The hidden gem on this release is undoubted \\"Curse My Name\\", which is Blind Guardian's most authentic folky, Celtic number to date, and is light-years better than the somewhat turgid \\"Skalds and Shadows\\" from the prior album, incorporating fiddle, bagpipes, flute, and an actual Irish tap dance ensemble into a crescendoing, outstanding number.  The production, while a bit too compressed, still manages to showcase the rhythm section that was overly muted in \\"Nightfall\\", while still bringing the sense of orchestration that fans loved from that release to the table in a big way.  Blind Guardian is still quite obviously playing to their strengths, with the armies of vocal overdubs and guitar harmonies, coupled with guitar rhythms and tones that are more Metallica than Helloween in terms of their take on metal (although still not as aggressive as Blind Guardian were in 1995).      The band shows themselves to be \\"true\\" musicians in the best sense of the word; while Andre Olbrich and Marcus Siepen might not be able to play swept triplets in 5 different modes at precisely 150 bpm as exactingly as John Petrucci, they are greatly superior musicians in terms of making the music sound alive, flowing and organic, while never sacrificing the requisite degree of precision that's needed for Blind Guardian's brand of epic metal. I'll gladly forgo winning a technical phallic measurement contest amongst fanboys, in favor of something that just sounds plain awesome, and, while showing the band's everpresent influences, avoids plagiarism.      As great as \\"At The Edge of Time\\" is, there is still a nagging feeling that the band is playing it a little safe by giving the fans \\"what they want\\", and not much more.  Songs like \\"Fly\\" and \\"Sadly Sings Destiny\\" may have alienated some fans, but they did push the envelope as far as what an ostensible \\"power metal\\" outfit can accomplish in terms of sounding more modern.  Unfortunately, there's nothing quite so daring on this album.  Another issue is that while this is the band's most consistent effort in years, the songs don't stand out as memorably as the high points of previous albums (perhaps due to its newness to my ears?).  It also goes without saying that the nerdish artwork on the inside of the album booklet might be a bit much in terms of stereotyping the band (granted, this is an album that starts with a song originally written for a computer RPG, and closes with a song about a fantasy series that has passed the 10 book mark).  Overall, however, what the album misses in terms of taking a gamble on stepping outside the band's comfort zone, is outweighed in terms of the outright quality of this material.  In my opinion, this is yet another successful entry in Blind Guardian's body of work, and should be checked out by fans of larger than life music.
0439023513|2.0|This book shows all the horrors of war and the aftermath (PTSD). It presents the victors as normal, vulnerable people. Katniss is especially presented as a deranged, broken girl.    It felt like the storyline was carrying the characters, and not the other way around. Our beloved characters, Katniss and Peeta, were just pulled around by the plot. They didn't make as many decisions, and there wasn't much character development for these two either.    The love triangle felt like an afterthought, as if the author just stuck it in there because she was forced to. There was little development or explaining on how Peeta gradually got weaned off the capitol's control on his mind, and there were only a few romantic moments between Peeta and Katniss (2-3 paragraphs at most). The author also doesn't bother to indulge us on what happened to the two after Coin's assassination. She just summarizes their relationship in 1 paragraph. You'd think that after all that happened in the first 2 volumes, they deserve a little more screen time.     And although the book had a lot of GalexKatniss moments, the author clearly had no idea how to get Gale out of the picture. And so she solves her problem with a deux ex machina: she kills off Prim, using technology that Gale helped developed. Now whenever Katniss sees Gale, she thinks of how her sister died (the author says in ~2 lines). Yay for the author, now she got Gale out of the picture. Then she promptly hooks her up with Peeta in 1 paragraph. Yay, love triangle solved.    I know the story is about war, but the romance just felt too much like an afterthought.
0307454541|5.0|A little bit slow away, but once in its stride was absolutely enthralling. All the stars of the book had really separate characters. This was a side to Sweden that I had never envisaged - ruthless activities to keep their businesses alive. I've got two more of Stieg's books to read, and look forward to an enthralling time!!
B000GDH9JQ|5.0|Briefly, I love this movie. The story is excellent, the dancing is breathtaking, and the views of St Petersburg enchanting.

B002ZG999U|4.0|The Expendables is good old-fashioned dumb fun in the style of 80's invincible, one-man-army action movies-- you know the kind: impossible odds, endless streams of bullets, useless enemy soldiers who can't shoot the broad side of a barn, and tons of stuff blowing up, whether it needs to or not. If you're here, you came to see the action sequences and the ensemble cast of your favorite action film veterans, not for the spaghetti-thin plot. Once again, the good guys have to rescue the girl. The names are forgettable and the story of a corrupt South/Central-American dictator is pretty much just an excuse for the great fight sequences, absurd shootouts, car chase, and other ridiculously over-the-top stunts and shenanigans. In one scene, for example, the bad guys get strafed from above by the Expendables' seaplane by Lee Christmas (Jason Statham) sitting in a exposed nose turret, then doused with gasoline and the entire dock gets set ablaze with a flare gun, accompanied by a requisite explosion.<br /><br />The cast includes some of today's hottest action stars (and some nearly forgotten ones of yesteryear), including Jason Statham (Crank, the Transporter), Jet Li, MMA fighter Randy Couture, WWF superstar Steve Austin, Mickey Rourke, as well as a cameo from Bruce Willis and Arnold. As a result of all this star power, character development suffers and most of the characters are not fleshed out. We get some back-story about knife-expert Christmas and retired Expendables tattooman Tool (Rourke), but most of the other characters get nothing to work with. I even had trouble remembering some of their names after the movie was over. There are also some very unfunny short jokes aimed at Jet Li's character, Yin Yang.<br /><br />Former NFL player Terry Crews ([[ASIN:B002APNJCO Everybody Hates Chris: The Complete Series]], [[ASIN:B0002VYOV8 White Chicks]]), one of my favorite character actors, is always a pleasure to watch. Here, he is the AA-12 automatic shotgun wielding terror. He brings a shot of energy and comic presence to the film, even if it's for a very short moment: \\"You know, the enemy will always be terrified of noise. Especially shotguns. With this big boy spittin' out 250 rounds a minute, you tell me who's tolerating that.\\" Even with so few lines, he manages to bring a smile to my face. This is the exception, however. Most of the dialog in this film is corny, forced, and delivered with awkward timing and the finesse of a sledgehammer. Dolf Lundgren and Sly Stallone are as unintelligible as ever, if not more. They haven't aged a day, thanks to the miracle of plastic surgery. Some of their dialog, I really had to strain to understand what they were trying to say, not that what they say matters because it's all terribly unimportant. The scene where Willis, Arnold and Stallone meet in a church is brutally stiff. I've seen better delivery from my pizza man. It really was painful to watch the clumsy exchange. Stone Cold Steve Austen is stone cold dead in this film, being nothing more than a big goon who beats people up. He has zero stage presence.<br /><br />This is mindless summer fun that's inconsequential and requires absolutely no expenditure of brain cells. I do take issue with the way many of the fight sequences are shot and edited, making it difficult to see the action. Jerky camera and fast cuts make it hard to follow what's going on, leaving me a bit disoriented. Other than that and the already mentioned lack of character depth, this movie was entertaining for what it is. It doesn't pretend it's something more than a guns-blazing summer action flick.

B0036EH3XE|5.0|I for one loved the final season of the show.  I watched the first season snd part of the second season, when they first aired, thinking they were so-so.  Years went by and I watched the second season finale at a friends place on dvd.  This was my turning point.  Season 3 brought Juliet and it's been a roller coaster ride ever since.  I also love the fact that all the island's mysteries were not explained.  Why would I go back and watch all the episodes if I I already know everything.  The island was it's own complex character.  It's a shame that many Lost Fans fall into the generic category of wanting all the answer's.  Heaven forbid that they think or not have everything handed to them on a silver platter, wrapped in a bow.  In conclusion, the last episode was beautiful.  I felt my own closure with the show and the series, and can't think of any other way I would have wanted the show to end. Great series that will be terribly missed.
0143118420|1.0|I cannot understand why people like this boooooooring book. I painfully made it through Italy and started India...that's when I couldn't take it anymore and felt that stapling my hand to the wall would be far more interesting than continuing with this woman who never stops talking about the damn bathroom floor...save yourself and save your money! I hope I can get a few bucks for it at the used bookstore especially since I only read a portion. Seriously this woman quit her marriage for some reason that she won't share....umm ok isn't that part of what sent her out on this journey that resulted in an overly hyped up, waste of paper, diary of a cry baby? She roamed around Italy eating and talking a bunch of nonsense meanwhile not having to worry about money thanks to her book advance. What idiot publisher did that! I agree with many of the other reviews.....she is a spoiled lame. I will not even bother seeing the movie ugg!
1594488916|5.0|This book is compelling in that it is highly readable and it is actually an informative story that is well paced and an absolute attention grabber.<br /><br />The author has managed to capture why I feel the way I do about books.  I'm not a collector of rare books per se, but after reading this, I could certainly start down that road.<br /><br />Her personal way of relaying tidbits about rare books and their collectors also translates well into her passion for finding out about Gilkey.<br /><br />It is highly readable and truly falls into the category of \\"can't put it down\\".  If you love books and aren't quite sure why, get this one.  A worthy read.
B0036EH3WK|5.0|Though opinions vary regarding the show, I for one am quite happy with the complete edition package and suggest anyone who is a fan go out and buy it as part of their collection.
B003FXXNH6|5.0|If you are any kind of a fan of martial arts movies, this is a must see.<br /><br />This is like a cross between Van Dams old school classic Bloodsport and Jet Li's super smooth Fearless.<br />The fights are grounded (no obvious wire stuff) but the level of athleticism in Undisputed 3 is off the charts.<br />Each of the many fights have a different feel to them, so it never gets dull. Director Isaac Florentine and his crew know how to film/edit a fight, no choppy cuts, or shaky cam, just the actors showing off there abilities.<br /><br />Plot is light, but plenty of characters to keep things interesting. All the fighters are pretty good actors also, they dish out some super cheesy lines, but they all made me smile, not cringe.<br />Undisputed 2 is also worth seeing, but this one stands on its own just fine.
B003FVI2KQ|5.0|..have done we consumers great benefit in more than the direct intrinsic benefit of acquiring a hex-core, unlocked, easily overclocked & relatively low TDP processor.  As I've been building a second system, wherein my first is an i7 875K (quadcore with HT, unlocked & also good overclocker/low TDP), I've studied the Intel/AMD price trends..& the price drops & unlocking of the performance/mainstream 1156 Intel line corresponds to the release & gorgeous prices of AMD's flagship.<br /><br />Interestingly, this processor & my 875K have a very similar \\"feel\\" in terms of OC potential, price, & performance out of the box.  The competition has done great service to us all.  In many ways, I thank AMD for the $250.00 price cut that allowed me to acquire top-end parts on my 1st rig.  It is, in fact, the main reason I am building this new system around AMD.  & it's one helluva platform, too (crosshair iv formula, 8gb Patriot, Asus Radeon 5970 + Sapphire 5870/XFX XXX 5870, Intel SSD X25M, etc).<br /><br />5 star processor!
B000006MS3|5.0|When people speak of The Beatles reinventing music with Revolver, this is that very same type of experience.  This is nothing short of genius, and easily Kate's best album.  For what was to come in 1985 with Hounds of Love being her Sgt. Pepper - The Dreaming is her Revolver.  An amazing album with great short stories, characters and texture...not to mention that it is Out There.  One for the ages.  And I was one of it's detractors as a kid...I was in love with Kate's first three albums, and then The Dreaming came out in 1982, when I was 14 - and I was baffled by it..!  It took six months before it started to sink in, and once I got into the right space with it, it became like breathing air to me.  It is not an easily accessible album by any means - but like a book of good stories by Poe or Lovecraft...once you get it, it unfolds itself to you and you are a lifer.  There is no better album than this from that decade.  This is the definitive Kate Bush.
B0000025ZF|5.0|As many have said...this is a \\"concept\\" album about Rogers' life. So if you haven't been married, had kids, been successful, made enemies, thought about another women besides your mate then this won't make much sense. I found it to be a scary, thought provoking CD full of imagery. Slap on your headphones, toke up, sit back and really listen. At least you will have to love Eric, right?  We have our tickets for the Wall Show in Phoenix this November! Whoo-hoo!
B0039TD7RC|4.0|I really enjoy listening to this cd from time to time and even the additional unreleased tracks cd produces 2 classics on it! It's a definite own for any stones fan. Some call it there greatest work. I consider it in the top 5. This really shows the range though of the rolling stones in so many ways from rock / blues / country. So if you don't own this buy it! And if you don't get the hype the first listen through listen to it again :)

0451228375|1.0|After a nod to the middle ages, this schlockmeister keeps writing because he can and puts one sordid relationship and circumstance after another into a novel that has no time bounds really. Such machinations are found in every age. Must we really hear in detail how each couple came to have the relationship each has? There is no art to it. God help us close the book before we drive to the end just to see a handful of despicables come hopefully to a justly bad end. I fear he will ruin the middle ages for all of us. And now back to real life and a breath of air.
B003ITZBW2|5.0|The movie was awesome, but the special features had 2 batman animated series episodes; other than that it was nothing but trailers. i was hoping for directors interviews, cast (specifically Padalecki) interviews, and other content
B0006FFRW0|5.0|I state that because the 5.1 mix is the primary reason I purchased this copy, and I haven't listened to the CD side.  I am not going to focus much on the album itself because if you are looking at this, you probably already know the album and love it enough to consider this copy.<br /><br />So, the surround sound mix here definitely improves on what was already good in the original release.  Trent Reznor did a great job in creating this in surround sound without getting carried away, and I think that is huge.  In stereo the album already sounded pretty good.  The big difference is the added depth provided by the mix.  It really helps to separate the sounds, and while it is probably part of the remix (I'd have to listen to the CD side to know for sure), I feel like everything is a bit clearer than what was on the original CD release.  I am happy that the mix didn't add too much in the way of panning and other novelty surround sound items but rather kept things at the minimum and in a way that complements the music.<br /><br />This is a fantastic album, and if you are one that loves it and has the ability to listen in surround sound, than I think you can't go wrong in adding this copy to your collection.  As far as the CD side goes, I'm not sure if the remix is worth the upgrade.  I always thought the sound on the original was pretty good and didn't need improvement.<br /><br />If you have a surround system but don't know the album otherwise, you might want to try to listen for yourself a few songs before hand to understand what you are getting into in terms of lyrics and music.  It isn't the best choice for having a surround sound album just to have one.
B000I2J6K0|4.0|I've been doing this workout faithfully 2-3 times per week since about 10 weeks (currently 32 weeks), and I've been very happy with it.  I'm feeling good, and I think I owe a lot of that to this workout and the swimming and/or brisk walking I alternate it with.  I've done everything from traditional gym workouts with a trainer to Jillian Michaels to P90X, and I'm content with the cardio and light resistance this DVD provides.  I haven't done the partner workout, so I'm only reviewing the 40-minute individual one.  See below for why I give it 4 stars instead of 5.    Pros:  Good cardio without overdoing it  Lots of squats, lunges, and kickbacks to strengthen quads, hamstrings, and glutes for childbirth and recovery  Enough variety of moves to keep it interesting and challenging  Do-able both for newer exercisers (after going through the workout a few times) and the more experienced   Emphasizes attention to posture and form; both of which are always important but especially vital during pregnancy when you have additional back and ligament strain    Cons:  Music (upbeat childrens' tunes) can be irritating (once you become familiar with the workout, however, you can turn it down or mute it and use your own music)  Non-traditional and informal filming (in her home living room with less-than professional camera work), but makes it feel real and down-to-earth  Not much heavy-duty arm work (only push-ups and dips)  \\"Relaxation\\" portion at very end is pretty hokey
0439023483|4.0|I'm a big fan of \\"Survivor\\" so I hardly had to read any of the back flap of THE HUNGER GAMES before I was hooked. 24 kids in a fight to the death on live TV sounds gruesome, and it was, but it was also intriguing. I was in Katniss Everdeen's head from the beginning; I felt her desperation and I understood the misery of her life in a future North America that requires adolescent participation in these annual games. Yet I enjoyed her clever survivor skills, her strategies and the little self-discoveries she made along the way. This is a YA book that adults will be just as keen for as kids, though some of the shocking and dreadful parts may be too much for some. My only criticism is that the editor dropped the ball on catching typos, poor sentence structure and fragments. I can take a few fragments now and then when they fit the flow of the story, but sometimes the author, Suzanne Collins, pulled me right out of the action and slapped me with grammatical flotsam and jetsam. Still, it was an excellent read.

0143144006|5.0|My Stroke of Insight can completely change the way you look at life! Not only is it extraordinairily informative regarding stroke victims, but it's amazingly insightful in regard to how we all deal with life, love, family and friends. I've never read a better book about caring for the injured or sick and about approaching life knowing that happiness is a choice! I highly recommend this book (and the audiobook is WONDERFUL!) to anyone under any circumstances. A MUST read for families and caretakers of stroke victims. This should be required reading for any medical professional! And don't be intimidated by the first section - brain anatomy - it's not neccessary that you fully understand/retain all those details in order to comprehend the rest of the book. Believe me, you'll get the message by the time you finish it.
B002ZG977Y|4.0|This was a fun movie, lots of action and adventure, good characters, visually stimulating and has Liam Neeson as Zeus! You can't beat that.     This  movie got a lot of flack for being hastily \\"converted\\" to 3D at the last minute before being released to theaters. But I thought it actually looked pretty good. I watched it in 3D at home on a regular TV using my TV Eyes 3D glasses. (They're a type of optical 3D glasses that makes regular movies look 3D without having to use a 3D TV or 3D movie).     The effects really looked good. Medusa in her wrecked castle, slithering around everywhere, her whipsnake body lashing and curling over all the pillars looked amazing. Loved the effect when she turned people to stone.     There were several really good 3D scenes, the toppling of the statue of Zeus, with Perseus's family ship in the ocean below the cliffs, you could really see all the way out to the horizon. The confrontation between Zeus and Hades in Olympus. Hades appearing in the hall like a giant angel of death. The attack of the giant scorpions. And, of course, the Kraken. I especially loved the flying chase scene where Perseus, on Pegasus, has to chase one of the harpies all over the besieged city to get back Medusa's head that it had stolen.     Overall, a very visually vibrant movie. It had a good mythological feel to it. A straightforward story without being too simple. Lots of heroism as Perseus fights not only the monsters, but the gods, and the other humans expectations of him.     The star, who also starred in Avatar, was especially good, I thought. Believable without ever overpowering the role with his \\"stardom\\" that's a great quality in an actor. He makes the character come to life.     I gave this movie 4 stars. It's not the most amazing movie ever made, but it is a great way to spend a couple of hours on a lazy afternoon. And it looked great in 3D on my TV. Beautiful stuff. (Especially the location shoots which were very atmospheric and lush.)
B000YPUFA6|3.0|The blu-ray version of this movie was outstanding, very good picture and sound (not quite avatar which I believe to be as good as it gets but in the upper echelon and really well done). The movie itself is a huge letdown compared to the first 2 in the series, story, sub plots and even umbrella lost it's bang. Hopefully they will rebound with the next one.<br />Blu-ray video 4.5 stars<br />blu-ray audio 4.5 stars<br />movie itself - 2 stars

1439181780|1.0|Long before I came across this statement from The Power:  \\"If you feel bad about having bad feelings, you are adding more power to your bad feelings,\\" I was having bad feelings about what I was reading. This book proclaiming to be about love and good feelings presents a disturbingly cold, mechanistic view of life. In one example, Byrne loses her dog. While she and her daughter are searching, \\"negative feelings of anguish [begin] to increase. I knew we had to stop searching....\\" Why, you might ask? Because the universe has no choice but to deliver the result \\"lost dog\\" that has been placed in its magnetic head via Byrne's transmission. Note that a natural human emotion related to our capacity to care has been labeled \\"negative\\"--that is, bad. The act of searching for your dog and feeling concern about it renders the universe incapable of letting you find it. So Byrne goes home and puts food in the dog's bowl instead, and goes to bed. Maybe then the universe will understand what it should do. Is that fair to the dog? If the universe is that thrown off by human feeling for a lost companion, then how powerful can it be? (The dog was found by a neighbor.)<br /><br />In another example, the universe drives your dream car past you for you to select. But in the midst of focusing all your intensified love at the car in order to attract it, you feel a twinge of envy for its driver. \\"You just gonged yourself out of having your dream car,\\" Byrne tells us. Just like that. Canceled. That is \\"The Power\\". A universe where concern for a lost companion is labeled \\"negative\\", but obsessive love for a car is \\"positive\\"--until you mar it with a whiff of the negative. A universe where any human feeling besides a relentlessly imposed positivity is considered deficient, and might even be considered, in the words of Neville Goddard, cited in the book, an infection: \\"to think feelingly of mistakes of the past is to re-infect yourself.\\" Re-infect yourself with what? A conscience? This relentless universe, which can only copy everything you think or feel (Byrne offers the terms \\"boomerang\\" and \\"copying machine\\" as helpful in understanding it) unfolds with Byrne's opening remarks: \\"Life is simple. Your life is made up of only two kinds of things, positive things and negative things.\\" Well, no. It's not. Not my life. My life is made up of many things, most of which are not reducible to a positive/negative dichotomy.  To reduce all things and experiences to one of two polarized categories is to rob the world and life of their grandeur, their beauty, their complexity, and yes, their difficulties and their heartbreak, too. And there is nothing in Byrne's universe that escapes being reduced in this way.<br /><br />Take relationships. Byrne encourages us to think of people as our personal Emotional Trainers, monitoring them on the positive-negative scale to be utilized as teachers in building our own personal universes, or to be avoided, accordingly.  \\"When you're happy, then only the happy version of other people can come into your life.\\" Never mind the stunningly obvious untruth of this claim. What does it mean to admit only controlled versions of whole human beings into your presence--controlled by you? What kind of friends, partners and parents would that make us? Doesn't being in relationship with others ask us to be people of many dimensions, capable of understanding the full range of human experience and extending that understanding to others? Screening others through a positive/negative filter for their usefulness to us is not love.<br /><br />Yes, the world would be a better place if people cultivated more love and gratitude in their lives. But we don't employ them to manipulate people and things to our uses. In Byrne's construction, love is no longer the highest human virtue. It is a mechanism, designed to trip the switch of the mechanical universe to have your desires unblinkingly, unthinkingly delivered expressly to you. In fact love is not even love, desire is love, Byrne reveals at one point. Where is the heart here? In an entire book putatively devoted to love, I don't find a speck of compassion for other people, or for animals, or for the earth. Maybe that's because \\"as far as the law of attraction is concerned, there is only one person in the world--you!\\" There's no reciprocity here. No fellow feeling. You wouldn't want to ruffle your magnificent positivity by troubling yourself with another person's feelings.<br /><br />But what if love is actually love? Not positivity, not desire, not trying to feel good all the time, but actual love, something people have been willing to live and die for, something that moves you so deeply that it causes you to act, that takes you to a depth of humanity you didn't even know you had, for the sake of someone or something else? What if that is love?<br /><br />Beware whenever Byrne uses the term \\"simple.\\" It seems to be code for disengaging our minds and our hearts. Regarding wealth, Byrne tells us: \\"It's as simple as that.\\"  As simple as what? Good feelings are how the majority of the world's money ended up in the hands of ten percent of the people, she tells us. She writes that the only difference between wealthy people and everyone else is that the wealthy give more good feelings about money. This is not only ignorant of economics, history and politics, it diminishes the efforts of those who have earned their money through initiative and diligence--not attraction--and it deifies those who have obtained it through ruthless exploitation. Once again it's a reduction, and it's simple all right: there can be, after all, only two kinds of things in the world:  positive/negative, wealthy/not wealthy, good-feeling/bad-feeling.<br /><br />The worst simplification in The Power, though, has to do with the way Byrne intersperses selected quotations from writers, humanitarians and spiritual teachers throughout her narrative, as if to suggest that all along they were attesting to the hidden powers Byrne has now brought to light. An examination of just a few of the lives of the people she cites would demonstrate that this is not the case. To comment on just two of them, Jesus and Bonhoeffer, Byrne, by failing to consider the complete arc of their stories, trivializes them and cheapens their lives. Both were committed to love and justice.  Both were executed for it.  They weren't trying to have, do or be anything they wanted, they were resisting the powers of their day. How do their deaths fit Byrne's law of attraction? Was theirs a failure to think positive thoughts and feel good feelings? The love Jesus taught was far more radical and generous than a boomerang universe. For him, love was caring for \\"the least of these\\"--those who were outside the realm of the comfortable, the powerful, and the admired. He didn't blame people who were struggling or ill for their fate. Bonhoeffer conspired against Hitler to try to defeat him. He did not shrink from the challenge of his time. He did not hide in a pristine universe dedicated to giving him what he wanted.  He did not look away from the news, as Byrne advises.  If people hadn't dared to face terrible things in life head on at personal cost to themselves the world might have fallen to those such as Hitler. Each generation faces challenges. To choose to ignore them because \\"life is supposed to be fun\\" is to remain a perpetual child, and to fail the next generation. Byrne warns: \\"Taking things too seriously brings a life you have to take seriously.\\" Yes, and we are all indebted to those who took it seriously.<br /><br />I do not feel bad about feeling bad about Byrne's book. I feel grateful that I have a facility for analytical thinking, or at least plain common sense, which is as essential to human endeavor as so called positive thinking. And using common sense, I can discern that a woman who tells a story about attracting a skirt from Paris to Australia, just one, in her size, is not one who is engaged in the significant matters of our time, no matter how frequently she peppers her text with quotations from those who were. The way Byrne ends her book implies that she does consider herself a luminary in the spiritual pantheon despite having demonstrated little more in the book than how she attracted a skirt, a bouquet of flowers, and failed to search for a lost companion: \\"May The Power bring you love and joy for your entire existence. That is my intention for you, and for the world.\\" Rhonda Byrne, please spare me your intention. I do not want your small, self-involved universe. It's not big enough for me. I am not a magnet. I, unlike your universe, have a heart and a mind. If my dog is lost, I'm going to search for her.

B002YIHO7I|4.0|I got this album as soon as it came out. Honestly, it took several listens before I liked it. But, now I love this album. It's been 10 years since the release of Lover's Rock and this album does not disappoint. The album starts out with the Moon and the Sky, which is a beautiful ballad. Soldier Of Love comes up second and is a strong single. I've heard it played on the radio some, which is good to hear her on the airwaves again. Next is Morning Bird which is a haunting tale of love. Next is Babyfather, which is a fun song about being her baby's daddy. I don't want to give the rest of the album away, but this album will not disappoint. Its full of great tracks that are haunting and brooding, much like Sade herself.
1843793792|3.0|This is one of my favorite Georgette Heyer novels and the heart and delight was abridged out of it.
B000051VWW|5.0|Sade's much anticipated follow-up to Love's Deluxe, Lover's Rock does not disappoint. This album is full of heart felt, haunting and brilliant songs. Every track on this album is a gem. I have owned this album for a number of years and still listen to it quite frequently. The album starts out with By Your Side and brooding and haunting track about never leaving her man's side. King of Sorrow will make you cry as she sings for all the things she has to carry on in a tough world. Somebody Already Broke my Heart is as you would guess, about someone who broke her heart and she doesn't want to play games. Every track on this song is note worthy. I find relevance in all her songs, something that makes me feel like I have been through that ordeal as well. Sade has sexy, sultry vocals back splashed onto a set a smooth jazzy beats. This album will not disappoint in the least. This is one of the best all time albums in my honest opinion. I never grow tired of listening to it.
B000FBFN0Q|3.0|For the majority of the book I just thought the character Rebecca was just a compulsive liar who had a terrible spending problem. She seemed pretty immature for a 25 year old who always had to make up lies to justify her ruthless spending. HOWEVER, I thought the book started to become rather interesting when Rebecca's life made a huge turnaround and she was able to change her life and be a new person...sort of. I wish there was more of that in the book. I really liked the ending though.
0099527561|5.0|The other reviewers have amply described the storyline of this book and its predecessor, The Dawn Patrol.  At the risk of redundancy, Don Winslow is an underappreciated literary treasure and his books just keep getting better.  As I wrote in a previous review, I look forward and beg for more books with this same endearing band of characters amidst the San Diego seascape.  It is 2 a.m. and I could not put this book down. Absolutely fantastic.
0765326353|4.0|I'm tempted to give books I like 5 stars. It seems a small way to reward authors for the incredible amount of time and effort they have had to invest in something I get to enjoy. I hope creating a good overall rating will push others to also read the books so the author can make a good living and create even more of those same Fantasy/Sci-Fi novels that I enjoy reading so much. That being said, 5 stars like a true A/A+ is not for good or great, it's for outstanding; above and beyond what was expected. To give everything 5 stars only makes everything of that rating mediocre and doesn't truly separate the very good from the amazing.    The Way of Kings is very good, I used the TV as a way to keep my daughter from bothering me for a couple of hours today just so I could finish the book. I was both entertained and rarely wished to be able to skip ahead to characters I cared about more. Like a good movie, you never feel the book is too long or dragging.     When I read the overly glowing reports stating things such as 'most amazing', 'hugely complex' and 'best work' I 1st wonder if they've read Elantris [[ASIN:0765350378 Elantris]] which was excellent for it's originality or the Mistborn series [[ASIN:076536543X Mistborn Trilogy Boxed Set]] which had a clever magic system as well. Just because a book is epic in size does not make it better than a shorter work. tWoK has a entities whose origins and purpose are not yet explained, but again having many of something does not make it complex in itself. There are not many types of magic in the book, only a few well thought out effects are portrayed though more could of course be added in the future novels as more people are brought into the story or present people uncover more abilities within themselves.    Not to mix reviews but if you want a taste of complicated world/magic/race systems try [[ASIN:0765322889 Gardens of the Moon (Malazan Book of the Fallen)]]. tWoK was without a doubt fun to read, but I did not find myself in love with the world or cheering on the characters as I have in other novels. I enjoyed the fight scenes and guessed at the outcomes (I did not guess correctly on a major one), but the results didn't affect me profoundly either way.    I look forward to reading the future books in the series to uncover more background as to who some of the characters truly are and if you are a fan of this genre you will no doubt enjoy this first of the series. Brandon Sanderson has a long career as a writer if he chooses it and I look forward to his finishing The Wheel of Time [[ASIN:0812511816 The Eye of the World (The Wheel of Time, Book 1)]] series for the late Mr. Jordan since he did an amazing job on the most recent release of that series.

0307454541|5.0|I read all 3 of these Stieg Larsson \\"Milennium\\" books in about 2 weeks on vacation & highly recommend them. Not only are they well written mysteries involving unusal characters, they are windows into contemporary Sweden - a place which, frankly, I'd never thought alot about. You save the cost of an airline ticket and get to see Stockholm a little like you would if you stayed with friends who live there. (This aspect is really enhanced by seeing the movie - produced in Sweden by Swedes.)<br /><br />I've recommended the book to others & the most common response has been that Dragon Tattoo is so long and full of alot of snoozy non-action and side plots and relationships. I am mostly writing this to tell any new reader to hang in - it picks up and all 3 books together are one fascinating saga. If you are hooked by Lisbeth & Mikael, you'll be glad you stayed with all 3!
0061537969|4.0|Good to read, and interesting since I knew nothing about car racing. The author explains the skills needed to succeed as a race driver to his willing listener, his dog, and we all learn that most of those skills transfer to life's problems as well. My book club members confessed to lots of tears, and we had plenty to discuss, as far as the obstacles our hero had to overcome.
1423113381|5.0|I can't wait for the other books in the series to be published.  I found the story gripping and full of twist and turns to keep your interest.  Is a great chapter book to read out-loud with your kids, especially if they enjoyed the Percy Jackson series.  I liked that the book concluded at a descent stopping point, while you're still left with some mystery you're not left with a total cliff-hanger.  I wish people would enjoy the book for its intended fictional category and, not try to point out some little error in a god reference, this isn't a history book. It makes reference too many things we believe to be true of the way the Egyptians were looked at.
0765326353|5.0|I loved it. I preferred some view points to the others (Kaladin) and was mad when they cut off, but I ended up liking them all in the end.

B002ZG98C8|4.0|Awaiting with great anticipation with RR since he last released Grindhouse in 2007. You could say I was more than excited to see Rodriguez reteam with regular Danny Trejo in Machete. I was surprised to see little turn out at the theater I was at. Machete is a former Mexican Federale who, after a tragic incident, is forced to become a day laborer in the U.S.. He is set up and left for dead. However, he is now caught between one of the most potent topics in the States today and revenge against those who caused his loss in the past. Action film junkies will get what they bargained for along with some of the best cheesy dialogue to come around since the Death Wish films. The only complaints I had were that you could see the ending a mile off. I wished they could of developed Machete's character more instead of giving him one liners. And I wish some of the villains had better death scenes. Other than that it was a pretty good action flik. Be warned though, it's not for young kids.
030726999X|2.0|I ordered this trilogy without any knowledge of Stieg Larsson or any advanced information about the book(s) except that Don Imus raved about \\"Hornets Nest\\" on his morning radio show and that Stieg was now dead.  I looked it up and realized that it was the final installment of a trilogy and it became evident that I would have to read all three, in order, to get the full effect.

I mention this because I want to set the scene that I was just looking for some mindless fiction to relax with......no thinking, no deep thoughts, just relaxation.<br /><br />The books arrived and I was slightly taken aback by the length of each book....between 500 and 600 pages.  I am not afraid of a long read as long as it can hold my interest.  Well, unfortunately, these three books had me slipping in and out of attention.<br /><br />Who was the editor on these?  These books ramble on and on with the most ridicules nonsense just taking up pages and pages of space.  Time and time again, Mr. Larsson fills pages with completely unnecessary dribble and over-verbalized fluff.

Why did I have to know the thought process on how Lisbeth picked furniture for her humongous apartment that she did not use but 10%.<br /><br />Just once I want to read a book where the hero is not humble and just so perfect.  I get a little tired of reading over and over that every woman who meets our hero must seduce him.  Give me a break.

B002ZG993Q|2.0|In the 1950s, Miles Davis introduced something called modal music.  A simple melody was the foundation for highly skilled and creative musicians to solo around.  I assume that was the concept behind this flick.  A simple, uncomplicated story: a highly competent assassin loses his taste for the job, falls in love with a prostitute, then, well the ending (I won't spoil it).  OK, pretty mundane story, I thought this was to be the backdrop for some pretty serious acting chops to be offered.  Umph, wrong!  Clooney and company were not up to the challenge if that was in fact the idea.  After chatting a bit with my wife after it was over, I suddenly realized why this movie was really made.  It was a tax write off for Clooney's Italian Villa.  Two stars only for the beautiful Italian country side.  Bottom line: skip this dreadfully boring, journeyman level exercise in acting and film making.
0307454541|4.0|It was hard to get through this book in places and I pretty much guessed who the murderer was as soon as he was introduced in the book.  The shining star in the whole book was Lisbeth Salander.  For some reason I really cared about what happened to her.  We women don't get too many female heroins we can relate to.  The fact that she came from disadvantaged childhood, which also led to a less than ideal adulthood made her an even more sympathetic character.  Not that I'm that well read, but most heroins in books that I've read (at least books that are fiction) usually come from at least middle class or wealthy backgrounds. I find myself cheering her on, and she is the only reason I would read the 2nd book in the Trilogy.  By the way the Swedish version of the movie was a real turd, hopefully the US version will be better, but somehow I doubt it!<br /><br />Update - I read the next two books and have to say it was well worth it.  Although the first book was somewhat hard to get through (a lot of detail, but you will understand why when you read the next 2 books) Lisbeth made me want to read more. Good books, much better than most books I've read and definitely much better than the really bad 50 Shades of Gray trilogy.
B001NZU7GI|3.0|Gotta believe the other reviewers have not heard the original Derek and the Dominoes Live that came out in 1973.   Clapton shows flashes of brilliance on this album.  But overall, it doesn't come close to the original.

Now four thousand five hundred plus years since they dispersed, they have become myths while their shardblade weapons and shardplate armor have become the most valuable commodity on Roshar.<br /><br />Shallan the scholar has uncovered an inconvenient truth as she serves as an apprentice to the sister of the King.  Unlike his aristocratic peers, visionary warrior Dalinar Kholin, the current king's uncle looks to the past to forge an honorable just future.  Finally acrimonious Kaladin went from aristocratic surgeon to slave to save the life of his brother, but it cost him his honor and caring of others.<br /><br />The opening act of the Stormlight Machine an epic fantasy which a monster sized book in which Brandon Sanderson establishes his world in minute detail (some might say overly detailed) and the flaws of his three prime players.  The story line contains several subplots with Shallan, Kholin and Kaladin serving as the main three in the intertwining saga.  Especially intriguing, besides the encyclopedic fascinating depth of Roshar, is the gripping sagas of Kaladin and Shallan; while the arc of Kholin feels forced as if a fantasy element was needed to spice up the saga.  Still this is a fascinating grand beginning to what looks like an epic worthy of the late Robert Jordan.<br /><br />Harriet Klausner
0307463745|5.0|I don't often do a book review like this... but I have to say that, to date... it was one of the best books on business I've ever read.<br /><br />An easy, quick read, it let me step into my own true self and not be afraid to speak my mind (in both my business and personal life).  Groundbreaking and a must read for any business owner.
B002ZG9968|2.0|To be fair, I don't have anything against Jennifer Lopez.  I think she's an amazingly talented entertainer. She's like the Bronx Julia Roberts. But, I'm honestly surprised at how many good reviews this movie has gotten on Amazon.  It was panned by movie critics and was short lived in the theaters.<br /><br />Sure, there are some cute aspects to this dvd and a few chuckle moments. However, there were also one too many gross-out moments (ob-gyn's office... enough said). But the story and dialogue were horrible.  The leading male was so bad that even Anthony Anderson couldn't help his acting seem better by comparison!  The movie heavily relied on its supporting cast Albert Klein, Tom Bosley, Linda Lavin, Melissa McCarthy, etc.  It was very obvious that Lopez also (unsuccessfully) relied on her own motherhood experiences.<br /><br />This movie was scripted a little too much like Diane Keaton's Baby Boom (1987): [ex]career woman, cute guy who lives on a farm, hilarious baby antics, etc.  If 'The Back-up Plan' had been billed as a remake, then maybe I'd have given it more slack.  But after watching this dvd, and then following it up with the MUCH superior 'The Wedding Planner' and 'Maid in Manhattan,' it's obvious that this latest movie was NOT a labor of love.
B003T0G9XU|5.0|An absolutely beautiful book.  It actually brought me to tears on three separate occasions (I will admit to being a bit of a sap)<br /><br />I have been reading Terry Pratchett's books for 16 years since I first discovered 'Sourcery' in my high school library and then went back and caught up with the others and I truly believe this is his best.  At least, it resonated the most with me.<br /><br />Considering at the point he wrote it his Alzheimer's had reached the point where he could no longer type but needs to dictate his words, this is an incredible achievement.  The man is still sharp as a whip and an incredible storywriter to boot.<br /><br />I haven't loved one of his books this much since I read 'Maskerade' and I loved that book an awful lot.. as I did 'Witches Abroad' so maybe I'm just partial to the witch related stories?  Nevertheless if you are a fan, you owe it to yourself to read this.  After reading the previous three Tiffany Aching books of course as they all tie in together.<br /><br />Once again, I love this book and it has made my top ten of favourite books ever.<br /><br />As far as the Kindle edition goes, it was just fine.  Formatting was great, easy to read, all the illustrations translated quite nicely and only one spelling mistake.
B002SEW5WW|5.0|One Republic is one of the better bands to hit the stage  Buy both of CD's you wont' regret it - \\"Dreaming Out Loud\\"   Also buy Cold Plays' \\"Viva La Vida\\", all three make a perfect afternoon of listening to beautiful music.

0385528752|5.0|I am a fan of the Heath brothers already from their Fast Company column and their first book, Made To Stick.  I really loved Switch.  The topic on change is important (it is subtitled How To Change Things When Change Is Hard).  The format is very accessible with lots of varied examples, chapter reviews of the main highlights, and catchy teaching phrases, such as Find Your Bright Spots or Shrink The Change.    A lot of their advice dovetails very nicely with traditional coaching advice, so I may make this required reading for my clients undergoing big upheaval.  But even without a coaching background, you can appreciate the motivational, yet practical tips.    You have to read this book for yourself, so I won't spoil it, but here are some of the fun items:    When change seems too hard, it's not because you're lazy; it's because you're exhausted.  You need to make things easy for yourself;    Direct the Rider (your analytical side)/ Motivate the Elephant (your emotions).  Who can't hook onto that catchy phrase?;    Why the Food Pyramid may as well be a Food Rhombus or a Food Rooster (this still makes me laugh out loud when I think of it);    The Heath brothers personal foray into salsa dancing also made me smile!    It's a fast read but packed with useful advice you can use right away to make changes in different areas of your life or in the workplace.  Read this book!
B00005QGAV|3.0|I love the CD but I thought since this was supposed to be a special edition it would include special tracks, interviews or unreleased cuts. IT seemed to be the same as the CD I already had. The only thing that was different was the cover (liner notes section) which had some different pictures.
B0000793ZC|5.0|I recently rediscovered this in my CD collection and have been listening to some portion of it on a daily basis for almost a month now. I especially love the simplified and slower version of New Gold Dream that the set concludes with. It is a great concert album.
1416511946|4.0|I've been a Motley Crue fan as far back as I can even remember.  I've seen them many times LIVE over the years (as far back as 20+ years ago, and as recently as 2 weeks ago) and I've always been a huge, huge fan.<br /><br />On that basis, I bought the book.  I've always thought Nikki was a creative genius, and, after seeing several interviews with him on how bad he got, decided to see for myself just how bad it was.<br /><br />It's bad.  Mr. Rockstar Hides His Naked Junked Self Out in Closets with Guns Bad.<br /><br />The book itself is an extremely easy read.  He's got insights from himself in the present day, as well as all the cast of characters that were around for the Motley ride during the making of, and touring for, Girls Girls Girls.<br /><br />The only downer I found was that in the first part of the book, we know this is the year he dated Vanity.  I didn't mind, in fact I was very interested in, both of their commentary regarding the drug abuse/emotions/etc... the roller coaster that was their relationship.  However, I think that present-day Nikki let the Evangelist Denise Matthews (nee Vanity) wax on a little too much about God/Salvation.  There was one paragraph that summed it up - she was going on and on and on, and Nikki's present day commentary underneath was, \\"Huh?\\"  Yeah, exactly.<br /><br />I won't give away any more than that - it's a harrowing account, and wonderfully told by Nikki.  You won't be disappointed.
7885142434|1.0|This movie is like flipping thru a book to look at the pretty pictures.  The Wing Chun is the only good part of this movie, the rest of the movie is complete fiction.    Did anyone notice that his wife and kid look the same even though Ip Man 1 was in 1937, and Ip Man 2 was 1950?    I am sorry, but this is not the first time Sammo Hung has been part of a Chinese propaganda history film, and I just wish they would  stop tarnishing the real Ip Man with this fantasy life that never happened.
B003X9W98G|5.0|Well if you were thinking about purchasing this season... do so! I must say I have been a Doctor Who fan for some 27 years now and I have seen more episodes than I can count or recount if you get my meaning. As with the change from Christopher Eccleston to David Tennant I was not sure I would like the new Doctor, but Matt Smith nice job mate. I have all of the newer series and I have to say each one has been very entertaining and wonderful. I have a 9 year old and we have been watching each of the new series as they come out. This year has been wonderful and different than all the others. I thought the writers did a nice job bringing in new content and weaving in the old. I am really looking forward to the next season and I do hope they expand River's role some more. The characters of Amy and Rory were lovely as well. I will admit I would actually give this 4 1/2 stars because although it was truly lovely I'm saving my 5 in case next season is even better!
B0001ADAVK|5.0|Just saw this movie, based upon a 30-something professor of Art History, traveling solo from California to prestigious Wellesley. Her mission, revealed as it occurs...to deliver an unconventional, challenging style of education for young women, who have the right to be more than a breeder.<br /><br />As a younger, i was captive to the TV sitcoms, Donna Reed, Leave It to Beaver, Lassie, Father Knows Best, Dick Van Dyke and even Bewitched...women were homemakers, whose existence was solely for the husband and family. This film was a delightful antithesis to the programming of the 50's and 60's! Julia Roberts is sublimely compared (by reviewer Bret Frazer) to classic movie stars, like Bette Davis, Joan Crawford, and even Katherine Hepburn, for her ability to effortlessly \\"own\\" a movie with her performance, and boy howdy, does she do it well! She literally, subtlety commands the screen, in a completely vulnerable, yet determined manner, as Katherine Watson. Miss Watson is condescended at every opportunity for her background, her home state, her poverty (from yucky California!) and her \\"old maid\\" status.<br /><br />In one of the first scenes,(one of my favorites) Miss Watson finds herself immediately confronted by a pretentious pack of intellectual lionesses. They attack with brutal efficiency, formed from old money, education, and malicious poise....trust kittens, ingrained with beliefs counter to self actualization...quite vicious with verbal assaults and subliminal threats.<br /><br />As the movie unfolds, education, maturity, romance, roles, ideas and realities are explored...the pupils feline claws are slowly retracted as the teacher is seen for her uniquely brave character, strong values, and willingness to stand against established mores.<br /><br />Of note in the supporting cast, my two favorites: Kirsten Dunst plays repressed anger with venomous aplomb and Maggie Gyllenhaal is compelling as the group's pariah, the shameful bad girl...the scarlet letter of a divorced family. Gyllenhaal's character is more than likeable, developing survivor skills and heroic sensitivity on her own path of destructive awakening.  Mike Newell scores another base hit in his successful career as a director who captures real life on film, the same way Life magazine displayed photographs...The movie is enchanting, and damn, it is simply GOOD!aracter is more than likeable, developing survivor skills and heroic sensitivity on her own path of destructive awakening.

B00003CX9W|1.0|This is a great movie for kids though i'm interrested in seeing the newer edition, you can tell that this was dated. I am not giving the movie a poor review i am giving the sender a poor review because when i recieved the dvd the the casing was broken and i had to tape it back together. I did not return it because there was nothing wrong with the disc itself and didnt feel it was worth the effort of sending it back.
0811876373|5.0|Bakerella/Angie is a baker/blogger extraordinare!  This book is the culmination of all of her hard work!

B000RZIGVS|4.0|The following review covers the main areas in which I believe people ordering this product on-line consider important.     A. DELIVERY SCHEDULE  1. Importance to me = medium  2. Rating = 5/5  3. Comments: I ordered this product from archair_boogie, an Amazon Marketplace seller. The order was fulfilled promptly, and I received it within 5 days of placing the order, even though I did not request expedited delivery. I consider this excellent delivery service. However, keep in mind that other sellers may not be quite as prompt.    B. DELIVERY PACKAGING & CONDITION  1. Importance to me = high  2. Rating = 5/5  3. Comments: The boxed set was packed in a (USPS) cardboard box, which was then placed in the FedEx cardboard box with paper padding between the boxes to provide cushioning. The box arrived intact, and in good condition.    C. PRODUCT PACKAGING & CONDITION OF PACKAGING  1. Importance to me = medium  2. Rating = 1/5  3. Comments: The product came in a sealed plastic wrapping. The outer \\"shell\\" of the boxed set is reasonably attractive, and consists of \\"bookends\\" within which is a clear plastic \\"dome\\" that encases the DVD containers. Despite being stylish, this plastic case is not easy to put back on the containers. The DVDs are stored in twin-disk trays made of brittle green plastic, some of which had broken off. What was worse is that in some instances the clamping teeth for the disks were broken off, causing the disks to come loose upon opening the casing. The set is arranged into 3 sub-sets, each of which is held together by clear packing tape, allowing the disk trays to be opened like a book. Two of the three sub-sets in the boxed set that I received were encased in clear plastic sheaths, allowing them to be better held together. The third did not have this sheathing.    Judging by the cheap packaging I believed I was the victim of a bootleg scam. However, upon further research it turns out that people who bought this product from other (non-Amazon) vendors, such as Best Buy, also complained about this. I also found out that many people are discarding the original disk trays and replacing them with sturdier and more attractive DVD cases. One example, from a reputable manufacturer (Maxell) can be found at [...]:    [...]    D. PRODUCT CONDITION  1. Importance to me = high  2. Rating = 4.5/5  3. Comments: The DVDs were all undamaged and intact. However, I noticed a few scratches on the disk surfaces, and I wonder if those were originally present or occurred after I opened the box and the DVDs started slipping out because they were not secured in the trays. All the DVDs were included, but I did notice that a couple of them were not inserted in the correct order.    E. PRODUCT APPEARANCE  1. Importance to me = medium  2. Rating = 3.5/5  3. Comments: Each DVD has a label showing an image of a main character on the show, providing the season number and volume number within the season, and a listing of episodes by number and name. All of this is more than adequate; however, the print quality is somewhat low and the text can appear blurry.    F. ADDITIONAL CONTENT INCLUDED WITH PRODUCT  1. Importance to me = medium  2. Rating = 0/5  3. Comments: Pretty much the only content within the outer plastic covering of this boxed set are the DVDs themselves. Ordinarily, with a boxed set is included a catalog of the contents - a booklet that, at the very least, lists the episodes. To top things off, the disk trays have no labels - not even to indicate the season and episode number. Unless you keep your trays in the proper order at all times (and good luck with that, given the flimsy packing tape holding the sub-sets together) you may have to open several disk trays to find the disk you're looking for.    G. PRODUCT QUALITY  1. Importance to me = high  2. Rating = 4/5  3. Comments: I am a fairly dedicated Star Trek fan, and I've put my money where my mouth is by purchasing the entire movie line-up in the franchise, and have all of them in DVD format; for the earlier movies I also have them in VHS format. I have purchased the DVD boxed set of Star Trek: Deep Space Nine (which, in my opinion, rivals ST: TNG for drama and surpasses it in production value). I have some other merchandise. And so on. Therefore, I will most likely be biased if I talk about the show itself. Moreover, most people buying this product probably already enjoyed the show during its 7-year run, or at least are sold enough on it to be willing to buy the entire 7 seasons. So I'll focus instead on the 3 key elements of a DVD production - video, audio, features.    The video quality is reasonable, but not high quality. I am watching it on a 60\\" LCD display at 780p and for the most part the images are crisp. There is the occasional \\"ghosting\\" when there is movement under low lighting conditions, but that's par for the course when talking about something that was produced more than 20 years ago and reproduced in the compressed format of DVD. However, I wonder if Paramount could not have spent a little more time cleaning up the video.    [EDIT: Upon watching the set further, I have the following observations:  1. There is occasional but momentary pixellation of the image. This is not really a serious issue for me.  2. There are occasional \\"glitches\\", where there is pixellation and momentary freezing of images. These mostly simply disappear as the disk continues to turn. I have found that \\"rewinding\\" or \\"fast-forwarding\\" past these points will eliminate them upon playing back those portions again. If these are too frequent, I have found that ejecting the disk and cleaning it seems to help. This is an inconvenience.  3. On at least one disk (Season 1, Disk 3, Episode named \\"The Big Goodbye\\") the disk freezes, and no amount of rewinding or fast-forwarding will unstick the disk. This happens around 38:00 on the time clock, and it happens on both my DVD players. This is a serious quality issue.]    The 5:1 audio is much like it was when the showwas being broadcast. With a decent sound system you can hear a lot of the ambient sounds, and surround effects are occasionally put to good use.    This set is somewhat modest in the features category. Yes, the menu looks & sounds cool. However, there is no (obligatory, for DVD releases) commentary, and there are no language options. On the plus side, there is a bonus disk that contains features that have not been previously released, but this is something that would likely appeal to Trekkies rather than the general public. [But then, for that matter the entire boxed set is probably targeted at the Trekkie market.] In addition, the last disk for each season has \\"Mission Logs\\", which provide insights into the respective season and the Star Trek universe at large.    H. OVERALL VALUE  1. Importance to me = high  2. Rating = 4/5  3. Comments: This is a rather pricy item, and the customer has a right to expect a lot out of it. However, the first impression most people will get is the cheapness and throw-away quality of the product. But for those that look past the shoddy packaging and poor organization of the disks, this is undoubtedly a collector's item. I obtained the boxed set at a discounted price, so I'm willing to overlook the outward examples of lousy craftsmanship and focus, instead, on the show itself. And there, good readers, it shines.
0439023483|5.0|My Thoughts:  Wow, what a book. I'm one of the people who jumped on the Hunger Games train very late. I read this book on September 1st, 2010 which is a long time after it was released. It had the dystopian  feel to it so I was unsure about reading it since I'm usually not too into those types. I was so afraid I would be let down after all the hype building up about these books. I was so surprised how much I loved The Hunger Games! We meet Katniss  who is truly an inspiration for girls everywhere. She's so strong, determined, sincere, and has a big heart even though she has to be tough. She is best friends with Gale, who goes hunting with her. We don't get much info on Gale, just that he has a big family and he is the sole provider for his family. We meet Katniss's mother and sister Prim. Prim is just 12 years old. Katniss comes from a very poor family and she hunts illegally to feed her family and trades just to keep them going day to day.<br /><br />The Hunger Games take place every year. One boy and one girl between the ages of twelve and eighteen are called upon to participate in the annual Hunger Games, a fight to the death on live TV. Of course that year, Katniss is worried that her or Gale's name will be called because they have their names so many times in the draw. But, unfortunately her sister is called and Katniss stands up and volunteers to take her place. She can't imagine her sister making it, or having to try to survive. She can't see her sister go through that. Another boy is called, Peeta. What can I say about Peeta? He's pretty awesome to me. Katniss is vaguely familiar with Peeta, they sure don't hang out with each other and she's just glad it wasn't Gale.<br /><br />Anyways, they go to get ready for The Hunger Games, and the small interactions between Peeta and Katniss were nice especially when it would dawn on her, she needs to stay away from him since he's basically the enemy. The talent section where she shows them how she can shoot a bow and arrow cracked me up! I actually reread that passage a few times! They go onto The Hunger Games. It starts out simple enough with supplies out in the open and players going after what they want. And, some of the participates band together which is just pointless since only one can walk away the champion. The things they have to endure are painful to watch, painful to feel.<br /><br />I don't want to give away the whole book. Lets just put it this way, The Hunger Games is wonderful. The trials Katniss has to go through and she never gives up no matter what. She knows back home there are people waiting for her and she must defeat this! She must win.<br /><br />Peeta was likable at the beginning and by the end I really really really loved him. There has been so much talk about Team Gale and Team Peeta and I guess I do like Gale but I just don't feel much of a connection to him at this point (maybe because he wasn't in book 1 much) and Peeta just made me fall for him. The things he said, his personality, it was all there. Katniss is still brave and I am glad we saw things through her point of view. I really liked a lot of the characters. I really liked Rue. I didn't like Foxface very much. She just annoyed me I guess. The characters are likable, the plot is wonderful, the suspense was awesome, and I found myself happy, sad, crying, mad, hurt, and wanting to throw up throughout the book! Not many books make me feel all those emotions! In other words, hands down it was one of the best books I've ever read!<br /><br />Overall: I loved loved loved loved this book! Way to go Collins for making me fall in love with this novel because not many books like this do! I started reading this and finished it within a day, I kept telling myself every time I needed to set it down, just a few more chapters than I'll stop! Well, I didn't stop too often! It was so addicting!<br /><br />Cover: Like it, its simple but neat.<br /><br />What I'd Give It: 5/5 Cupcakes<br /><br />Taken from Princess Bookie<br />(Hardcover Edition)

1439148953|5.0|I just loved this book.  So did my husband and my best friend.  It is a deceptively simple story about a quiet, frightened young woman who comes to America as an immigrant in the 1950's.  If you look at it as a coming of age book, or a sensitive portrait of the immigrant experience, you will only be seeing part of what is here. I believe that it is a brutally honest character study of a certain type of woman that we may like to think we have evolved beyond.  The end is intriguing and somewhat shocking; it makes you reflect back on everything that has come before.  I can't say anymore about that.  So let me end by saying that I found it honest, moving and evocative.  Will you like it as much?  Let me say that we discussed it in my book group and there were very, very different reactions.  The resultant conversation was terrific, as we tried to figure out why it 'worked' for some of us and not others.
032147404X|5.0|This is a more professional digital \\"step-by-step\\" photography compared to the Dummy series. I was looking for a straight forward approach to successfully using my digital camera and not an academic point of reference. This book tells you directly what to do and how to avoid mistakes. If you want to \\"understand\\" the why and why not than a college course would be a good alternative.
B003P2WO5E|5.0|I have been anticipating this book quite literally all summer, and I have to say that it not only lived up to my expectations, but exceeded them. I was a little worried at the beginning of the book, when I didn't really understand how the magic systems worked and wasn't really sure of what was happening. However, the farther I got, the more clear everything became and I became more and more immersed in Mr. Sanderson's beautiful world.    Many of the characters kept me entranced from the beginning of the book (Shallan, Jasnah, and of course, Kaladin), while others such as Adolin and Dalinar had to grow on me before I really started to root for them, but by the middle to end of the book, I was entranced with all of them. Kaladin in particular was a real favorite of mine, reminding me at times vaguely of Kelsier from the Mistborn series.    The artwork spread throughout the book was also fantastic, and I'm very glad it was included as it gave me a more visual image of what the creatures of the book looked like. Roshar, the world in which the story takes place, is subject to brutal Highstorms, and the plant and animal life has been forced to adapt to them. Therefore, many of the creatures are insect like, and the art makes them easier to see in my mind.    The ending was fantastic, and I was never able to completely say to myself, \\"well, I saw that coming\\". Sanderson kept surprising me and threw me for a loop many times. I felt that the setup of the book was interesting as well, with \\"interludes\\" in between various parts to give us an idea of what was happening elsewhere in the world. It lent a real feeling of size to a world that otherwise took place in two main locations, which is probably a good thing for an epic fantasy.     All in all, Brandon Sanderson has once again lived up to my expectations for this book, and it will certainly earn a place on my shelf of favorite novels. I can hardly wait for the next installments, and hope they are as good as this one.
B0024FAR5M|5.0|i had to buy this because i saw the first episode on FX but i was on leave so i couldnt watch the rest of the season because the first episode just caught me the only other somewhat recent thing i saw besides some bad movie with Brian Bosworth this is a great show and Kurt Sutter is doing a good job with it.
0375842209|5.0|Although this book already has 917 reviews as I write, I just couldn't pass up the opportunity to add my name to the list of lovers of this powerful book. I had a little trouble getting into it at first. After about 85 pages I called the friend who recommended it to ask why she loved it so much. She told me to persevere and I will be greatly rewarded. So rarely do I have tears in my eyes while reading. There are many well written powerful books on the market with heart wrenching tales to tell but this book does it so well without being maudlin and manipulative. It is a very special piece of literature.
B002N5N5QQ|5.0|i didnt buy this one on here because i bought it through zune but this is a great following to the first season i cant wait for the second season
0375826742|4.0|My only complaint is right when something interesting was going on with Eragon you flip the page and the next chapter is on Roran. Besides that I didn't think it was to bad. Some say it is very violent and to that I said good.
B0006A9FKA|5.0|Movie is amazing, but it took FOREVER for it to arrive to my mailbox. I don't remember if it was free shipping or not, so I guess I can't complain too much.
0439023513|5.0|This book is like a roller coaster!  I could never predict what was going to happen!  She kept me hanging up til the very last page!  A little sad at the ending, but isn't that how it usually ends in real life?  Someone has to bow out gracefully.  Knowing the characters like I feel I do, a mushy, talk about it ending would not have worked.  Some feelings are just too deep to talk about.  It was easier to just leave. (Trying not to spoil it for some!)  These books gave me so much to think about as far as the human spirit, what happens when we let the government have too much power, how we can all turn to savages when our lives are in danger, how far would I go to protect someone I love, and on and on.  An awesome set of books!!!
0399534601|5.0|I've purchased several books by Keri Smith and have never been disappointed. Her creativity is inspiring and motivating. I look forward to anything she publishes in the future.
1608201236|5.0|There are enough reviews here that recap the book, so I'm not going to do that.  I will say that this is one of the best series I've ever read.  I couldn't put this book, or any of the books in the series, down.  The characters are original and so engaging.  You really care about them and need to know how things work out.  The murder mystery is excellent.  I can usually figure the mystery out for other books, but I think I only figured it out on book 1 for this series.  If you go back and read them a second time, you can definitely see to clues as to who the killer is.  Also, don' let the fact that the story involves gay men put you off a great series.  I'm a 29 year old, straight woman and absolutely loved it.

076790382X|5.0|Bill Bryson's I'M A STRANGER HERE MYSELF is a collection of newspaper articles he wrote between 1996 and 1998 for a London newspaper.  As the subtitle, Notes on Returning to America after Twenty Years Away, indicates, the pieces mostly concern Bryson's readjustments to being in the States after living abroad, in the U.K., for so long.  Upon returning to the United States, Bryson, an American, sought with his English wife a \\"nice place\\" in which to live.  They settled on and in quaint Hanover, NH, home of prestigious Dartmouth College.<br /><br />The articles, which were published weekly and by and large unfold with a certain sequential coherence, work best when they are focused on Bryson's observations of America as a returnee: everything's familiar, or becomes so again, tinged with the distinct alienation that comes from living abroad: he sees things as if new again.  Written for a British readership, the columns appeal to a certain British sense of humor--occasionally you feel as if you're eavesdropping on a joke, but still you laugh.  Bryson's trenchant criticism of American follies of government and society almost invariably hit the mark as well.  His parodies of the IRS tax form and the computer set-up guide are less successful, perhaps because the models on which they're based are already ridiculous and, more to the point, tedious.<br /><br />In fact, the more Bryson strays into invention, the less compelling his prose.  Far more enjoyable are his seemingly effortless observations, including such slight things as the sound of a porch screen door banging shut in summer.  What's more, his commentary on ordinary daily life as well as on the greater American political and social scene is laugh-out-loud hilarious and dead on.  This is a quick read and highly enjoyable.
B00008G8QV|2.0|One of the first things I did was to open the DVD on my computer, so I could print out the music I expected to find.  There wasn't any.  Instead, at the beginning of the DVD they tell you how to BUY the written music.  This is pretty outrageous when most music instruction comes with PDFs, or booklets that allow you to read along with the visual instruction.    The only way to learn the licks is to is to constantly rewind stop, play, go back,  - you get the idea.  Since you also are playing a guitar at the time, manipulating your laptop, or DVD player isn't exactly a snap.    The instructor is OK, but tends to leave out some fingerings as he demonstrates the licks, assuming you'll remember it from a previous bar.  This gets a bit annoying until you figure out his modus operandi.    As several others have mentioned, you don't get all of the music taught either.  The only reason I gave this two stars, instead of one, is that with the extra effort mentioned above, you CAN learn the material, assuming you're a reasonably competent guitarist to begin with.

B001M5UDGS|5.0|I first saw this at school. A classmate of mine brought it to class and we watched between our classes. I honestly didnt pay much attention to it the first time. But a few weeks later I saw it on here and decided to buy since I needed my order to over $25 so I could get free shipping. It was the smartest thing I ever done. I loved Whedon's Buffy and watch it regularly so I was familiar with his stuff. After watching Dr. Horrible about 10 times in a row I knew all the words to all the songs. The story is easy to follow and quickly engaging. Dr. Horrible is the villian but you immediately fall for him. Captain Hammer is arrogant in the best way possible. And while Penny isnt my favorite in the movie, Felicia Day is an amazing actress.  Recommend this to everyone you know. Very funny, witty, and entirely magical.

0446402397|4.0|The book was about three-quarters historical thriller -- scary and realistic.

All in all, though, a good first book that holds promise for more and better historical novels from this young writer.

0061703257|5.0|Dennis Lehane does an expert job laying out the world of Shutter Island. Federal marshal Teddy Daniels and his partner Chuck Aule arrive at Shutter Island to investigate the disappearance of Rachael Solano. The patients of Ashercliff hospital are criminally insane, locked down for their own safety and for the staff. As they investigate the details of Rachael's escape, Dennis and Chuck find disturbing signs of sinister practices going on behind fenced and guarded facilities on the island.<br /><br />There is never a dull moment, and no escape, once they learn the secrets of Ashercliff. The surprises never quit, all the way to the final pages. I began, thinking we had a literary novel, but ended up reclassifying Shutter Island as a first-rate thriller. If you haven't already seen the movie, read the book first. You'll be glad you did.

B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Mockingjay is the final installment of the Hunger Games Trilogy.  The first two books were a disturbing picture of a failed future with a totalitarian Capitol City cruelly ruling 12 districts. In the first two books, we experienced children killing children to survive for the amusement of the citizens of the Capitol.  In this 3rd book, the reader is as relieved as the children and members of the districts to finally be able to rise up in revolution against the Capitol. The book begins a few months after the last one and takes place in District 13, an entirely new society for us to learn about.  Collins continues to surprise and distress throughout this emotional novel, delving into the psyche of the characters more deeply than ever before.  It will not disappoint.
0307463745|4.0|I went in not knowing it would be a series of short essays and was initially disappointed by that.  But, the more I read the more I liked the message.  It's clearly a \\"No BS\\" approach to getting work done (the right work) and I'm on board with that approach for everything.    It's one of those books you read and think, \\"yeah, that's a lot of practical, common sense stuff\\", and it is just that.  Sometimes you need to be reminded of it and refer back to it.  My concern is that because it does seem so basic, and is such a quick read, that it can be forgotten (or overlooked) in the day-to-day work life.    Overall, I would recommend it - and I'd keep it visible on your shelf/desk to keep the message in sight.
0743277708|5.0|A young rabbit named Fiver sees a vision of blood and death--danger is coming to the rabbit warren! Thus begins this classic fantasy book for middle school and teen readers. Fiver tells his brother Hazel and they flee, along with nine other rabbits.<br /><br />The first several days of travel out in the open are harrowing, but they think their luck has changed when they happen upon another warren. Unlike the overcrowded warren they left behind, this one has plenty of room and they are invited to stay. Only Fiver senses that all is not as it seems. When one of their band almost loses his life, they learn the warren's deadly secret and must leave.<br /><br />Eventually they find the perfect spot for their own warren, a large hill called Watership Down. However, Hazel soon realizes they have a problem: without female rabbits to have babies, the warren won't last long. They come up with a solution, but carrying it out will test Hazel's leadership and the mettle of all of the rabbits to their limit.<br /><br />This middle school book tells an exciting story and is beautifully written. The lovable characters range from Hazel, the thoughtful leader who learns not to overreach himself, to Bigwig, the aggressive fighter who faces death more than once, and Fiver, the gentle, otherworldly psychic whose visions guide the group. One great charm of Watership Down is that tales of a legendary rabbit hero are sprinkled throughout the story. Whenever the rabbits face a dilemma and need inspiration, they lift their spirits with tales of a rabbit's courage, cleverness, and derring-do.<br /><br />Richard Adams had a hard time finding someone to publish this book for middle school readers. Publishers thought that a story about rabbits was for babies, but that the writing style was for adults, so who would read it? Lots of people, it turned out. In 1972  a small publisher took a chance on the unusual novel and it's still in print. I love Tolkien, but this is my favorite fantasy novel. I can't count how many times I've read it.<br /><br />Reading level: Ten and up. Good readers of 10-11 should do fine with it, unless the more adult writing style is off-putting. From comments I read online, many parents read this book aloud to their children and it is enjoyed and discussed by all.read it.    Reading level: Ten and up.

B003P2WO5E|4.0|So after I read the first three chapters as a preview I was NOT looking forward to this book. However, I've read Sanderson's other work, been a long time fan of the Wheel of Time, and figured I'd go ahead and give this \\"over-hyped\\" thing a chance.    Holy Moly, wear a diaper while you're reading this book...    It was very well paced, good characters, interesting world, and a neat story all rolled into one. The pacing and \\"readability\\" of Sanderson's style is what sets him apart. You don't get that from a 3 chapter preview but when you plunge into the whole book you're finished with 1000 pages before you know it. I like to sit down with heavy prose every once in awhile, but it's just as rewarding an experience to get a great story like this that's so smooth it basically reads itself.      I'm that guy who claims he has read \\"a few thousand books\\" but I swear its true :). Anyways, its hard to impress me these days but I consider this book to be rock solid.     Here's a summary on what I think:  Most epic thing I've ever read? (NO)  Best book by Sanderson? (NO, in my opinion, The Gathering Storm was strictly better)  Best Fantasy book this year? (YES)  Did I enjoy this book? (YES)  Do I recommend it? (YES)  Would I read the sequel? (YES)
B002ZCDR88|5.0|No need to add a lot to the pages of reviews written here, other than to say what is oh so obvious:  this is a simply outstanding album!<br /><br />But I will anyway.<br /><br />I don't think that I have ever been so engaged with a new CD.  Every song is superb -- superb lyrically (thanks to the fine selection of texts), superb musically (a huge array of talented musicians of all stripes), superbly well sung (Natalie has never ever sounded better, interpreting every lyric with perfection) and superbly produced (every arrangement is interesting, most are outstanding, the diversity and breadth breathtaking).<br /><br />My favorite tracks are \\"If No One Ever Marries Me\\", which starts so casually, so quietly, so personally, and evolves into a charming fantasy grounded in anticipated tragedy; and \\"The Blind Men and the Elephant\\", illustrating the essential truth that we all possess only PART of the truth.  Love the instrumental rave-up at the end.<br /><br />A word on the negative reviews. . .  I see one that refers to being disappointed at a concert, having expected Natalie to \\"sing her hits\\". This is a recurring theme. I mean, how boring is that?  Are we all supposed to eternally relive the narrow slice of our lives when we first clicked with a performer?  Here is an artist at the height of her powers, filled with creativity and talent;  what is she supposed to do, simply lie back in the comfort of past glory?<br /><br />I really don't think I'd want to be at a party with these people.  I'd die of boredom.<br /><br />Just get the CDs (both of them and the booklet).  Enter this wonderful world with an open mind.  Be prepared for bliss.

B003V4AK8E|5.0|I've mainly been a Playstation person over the years but with the new console \\"war\\" starting several years ago (and Microsoft being the first out of the gate) I decided to purchase an XBOX360..  Overall I'd say the 360 is an inferior system, EXCEPT for the controllers.  Microsoft hit the nail on the head with their design.<br /><br />Sony's controllers?? ehhhh, not so much..  They sorta suck for an adult and seem to have had a 10 yr old girl's hands in mind when they designed them..<br /><br />So, over the years I've been watching for a company to release a PS3 controller that feels like (or even better) than the 360's..  That time has come..<br /><br />The Power A Pro Elite was announced earlier this year and they delivered it in August of 2010..<br /><br />The controller feels and plays like a 360 controller, is strong, lightweight, and what a PS3 controller SHOULD have been out of the box..  The buttons trigger buttons feel different and have a stiffness towards the bottom of the pull that is really nice for shooters, and of course all the button and stick placements are perfect. (like a 360 controller)..<br /><br />This is by far the BEST controller I've ever purchased for any system, and I'm ordering another one next payday.  If you love a 360 controller, YOU WILL LOVE THIS ONE..  I'm just hoping Microsoft doesn't sue them for any patent violations it's SO like a 360 controller..<br /><br />Buy it..
B003NHRIUW|2.0|I was so excited to see this movie because the book was awesome! I quickly found the movie boring, and I wanted to turn it off. It barely followed the book, and skipped a lot of good plot lines. I was quite upset about the whole thing, and really wish I wouldn't have bought the movie in the first place. It was a waist of money. I would not recommend this movie to anyone. I would recommend the book, because it was better. The only reason I gave it 2 stars was because of the male actors in the movie. Miley Cyrus was not good at all... and I was a Hannah Montana fan, but the movie was so bad...definitely not even as close to being as good as The Notebook.
0374158460|5.0|This is the first review I've ever written on Amazon and will likely be my last.  It's also maybe more interpretative than is appropriate.  I should also note that I might probably reveal one or two [important] plot details in making my point, so if that concerns you, maybe you shouldn't read this. Once again:    SPOILERS  There's obviously a lot to be said about many of the themes of waste, consumerism, and political and media exposure in this novel.  On the first of these, the hypocrisy inherent to trying to be environmentally is maddening.  Inevitably, I have been forced to conclude that even if I `do my part' to help the environment (not eating meat, recycling, composting, cutting down on gas consumption, etc.) it is impossible for me to be truly at ease with my role because more and more it seems like no one else cares.  Walter knows this throughout the book, and it is only with the death of Lalitha, and the death of his hope of affecting that he finally indulges his most extreme impulses and lives alone in the woods and kidnaps a family's cat. It is immediately obvious that such a decision is not only harmful to his mental health, but also conflicts with humanity's own evolution in much the same way that Bobby the cat is at odds with the evolutionary patterns and history of the birds he murders.    The really important theme of the book--what Franzen that older authors can't begin to imagine (because many of them are dead)--is consumerism of modern society.  This consumerism extends beyond the frivolity of Blake's interior decorating choices to the way in which we consume information and shape our opinions.  The internet has provided not just an outlet for sociopaths and conspiracy nuts to spout their garbage and generate great hate in the populace (the anarchists in this book spring to mind, as do many movements seen in the recent news...), but has also obscured truth to the point that it is trivialized and completely relative.  The fact that a drug-induced rant, that is at once reproachful and apologetic, is able to inspire such a following is not at all unrealistic.    The problem is that people are too willing to believe what they want to believe; they are too willing to find nonexistent subtexts in Walter's blog posts and act on them.  The problem, Franzen is suggesting, isn't that people are writing bad things, it's the way they're reading everything that's written.  The availability of information has completely commoditized it (forgive me if I become repetitive) and what should be a time of freer thought and more accountability, has become a time for people to accept whatever matches their opinions the most, and ignore everything else (hopefully I'm not doing this with my reading of the book).  It's easy to write off Freedom as elitist because of it's characters and their social and financial statuses, but it's important to realize that the ignorance of Coyle Mathis is purer than that of Walter, Jocelyn Zorn, or Jonathan and Jenna's father (whose name escapes me) because his is the product of his upbringing, while theirs is the result of their own discomfort with questioning their ideals and decisions in order to engage in a difficult, but productive, discussion.

B003ITZBW2|5.0|Warner Brothers Animation is continuing with its quality direct-to-DVD films that take established comic stories that are fairly true to their origins, albeit abbreviated and somewhat altered.  This latest release sports superb animation, an engaging storyline, and fine voiceover work for a gifted cast.<br /><br />Bruce Greenwood, though not Kevin Conroy, makes a good Batman/Bruce Wayne.  Those of us who prefer Conroy in the role, can be satisfied with Greenwood's interpretation.<br /><br />Jensen Ackles, star of \\"Supernatural,\\" is excellent as the enigmatic Red Hood and Wade Williams fares very well in the role of The Black Mask.  Neil Patrick Harris makes a great Nightwing/Dick Grayson.<br /><br />However, John Dimaggio is OK as The Joker but the film would benefit the inclusion of Mark Hamill in the part.  His is the definitive voice while Dimaggio comes off a little bit too Heath-Ledger-like.<br /><br />David Warner should also have been a participant in the film as Ra's Al Ghul.  Jason Isaac's just doesn't have Warner's distinctive menace.  And if 92-year-old Efrem Zimbalist, Jr. hasn't retired, then his should have been the voice of Alfred as in did in the Batman animated series and subsequent movies and television follow-ups.<br /><br />The PG-13 rating for the film is warranted for the violent content and the occasional profanity; thus, for the parents who may not pay attention to the rating, the DVD should come with a more attention-grabbing disclaimer so that unsuspecting parents won't pop it in, thinking that they'ew getting a more \\"family-friendly\\" \\"SuperFriends\\" installment.<br /><br />\\"Batman: Under the Red Hood\\" is definitely not that.<br /><br />As far as the extras go, the best of these is \\"Robin: The Story of Dick Grayson,\\" a well-produced mini-documentary on the evolution of the character.  The \\"Jonah Hex\\" short is notable for its inspired casting of Thomas Jane (\\"The Punisher\\" and \\"The Mist\\") as the deformed bounty hunter and Linda Hamilton as a sinister saloon ma'am.<br /><br />As stated in the title, \\"Hood\\" loses a half star for its lack of a more noticeable \\"warning\\" to parents.loses a half star for its lack of a more noticeable \\"warning\\" to parents.

B003XKPPOU|5.0|If you're a Toy Story fan at all, if you're a MOVIE fan at all, skip this review and go see Toy Story 3 immediately. Yes, it's good, it's really really good. I have a lot of \\"likes\\" on this one, so I want to get started already.    What I liked about the movie:  Story  Here's a little known fact about Toy Story 3, the story took 2 and a half years to perfect. And perfect is the correct word to use. I never talk plot in my reviews, I'm not going to start now. But I will say the trailer gives you a general idea as to what happens to the toys. But overall, the story is terrific. There is a solid beginning, middle and end. The end of this movie is very fitting to arguably one of the best trilogies in history, animated or not. I Tweeted after I left the theater, that the world would be a better place if Pixar wrote every movie in Hollywood. Online petition anyone?        The Characters  We all know them, we all love them, and they're all back. Woody, Buzz, Jesse, Mr. and Mrs. Potato Head, Rex, and more, are all in top form in this one. The voice acting is superb, as it has been throughout the trilogy. All the big names are back, i.e. Tom Hanks, Tim Allen, Joan Cusack. New comer Michael Keaton is awesome as the annoying, yet hilarious, Ken. Ned Betty plays one of the new major characters, Lotso the bear, also perfectly cast. Not everyone gets their fair share of screen time, but I felt that I got enough of all the major characters after an 11 year break from the previous Toy Story film. Great Job in this department.    The Animation  The animation just keeps getting better and better from Pixar. In our second installment of \\"You know what's a good movie?\\" we showcased the first Toy Story. And in that article I talked about how Pixar's techniques have improved with every movie they've released. TS3 is no exception. There are so many details that it's impossible to appreciate them all with just one viewing. I can't wait to see the movie again just to catch more that I may have missed the first time.    The Action  The action in TS3 is phenomenal. There are new things we've never seen in the previous 2 films. There's a planned escape scene that has so much to it, only Pixar could have kept track and executed it as well as they did. No spoiler here, but the last half hour of the movie involves a lot of action that was awesome. Again, it's only because the animators have gotten so good at what they do, that the action is this good.    The Themes  There haven't been too many movies that will tug at your emotional strings like this one will. In fact, I'll say this is the best movie of the year so far. There are several themes expressed throughout the movie. A child's coming of age. There is a fantastic scene in the movie where Andy is saying bye to his old room before he heads off to college. It's just Andy comforting his mom before he leaves, but it stays true to anyone who has experienced that situation. The emotion projected through the characters is nothing short of amazing.      MINOR SPOILER ALERT, not really giving anything away though:  Friendship is the other theme. Woody and Buzz' friendship. The friendship between Andy and Woody. The most talked about/ most Tweeted about/ most written about scene, will definitely have you in tears. I'm a man close to 30 years old. I haven't cried since the day of my wedding more than two years ago, and was crying like a high school girl on the night of a breakup. I can't express this enough, it comes down to Pixar's mastering of the art form. Without their amazing animators, none of the emotion would have came out of that particular scene where there is literally no dialogue, just emotion channeled through the characters.  END SPOILER ALERT.    The Ending  Some trilogies leave you disappointed, and this movie did not do that. Everything is wrapped up very nicely. Every problem resolved and we, as the audience leave the theater very satisfied with the toy's fates. There is a great scene with Andyand Woody that will stay with me for a long time. Amazing.      What I didn't like about the movie:  Rehash  I bet when you started reading this review, you didn't expect any negative feedback did you? Well 2 things, same category of negative. The first, too many plot points were similar in one way or another to Toy Story 2. I was reading this online before the movie came out and just sort of ignored it. But it's very obvious. By no means did it take away from experience though. In fact, I think they improved on all the material I felt they rehashed. Second was the latin Buzz, shown in multiple versions of the trailer. It worked, trust me, it's funny. But again, rehash. I can't really explain in detail about the Buzz scene without giving something away, so let me know what you think after you see the movie.      In conclusion, the movie is spectacular. I can't really do the movie justice with my review. The movie is so good on so many levels, to write about it in a blog format is not fair. Pixar is the best in the world at what they do, period. They knew to deliver this caliber a movie, it was going to take a long time. Like I said earlier, over 2 years writing and story boarding the movie. And it paid off. Unlike the rubbish that DreamWorks is banging out with their Shrek sequels, TS3 progressed the story and the characters.    One thing is for sure, I am going to miss these little computer generated toys a lot more than I thought I would before seeing the movie. To Disney, Pixar, the cast and crew... thank you for one of the BEST trilogies in movie history.
B0036EH3WK|5.0|LOST has to be one of my all time favorite television shows. So much so that even though I live in New Zealand I had to order this magnificent collectors set.<br /><br />Now season 3 & season 4 are region coded but all the other seasons (1,2,5 and 6) are region free. The bonus disc that is only available with this set is region free as well!<br /><br />Without giving to much away I have viewed the bonus disc and it has some very interesting interviews with the cast (after the show had finished) along with a feature with Michael Giacchino composing the final episode. It also features some behind the scenes features and deleted scenes that were missed off previous seasons.<br /><br />The design of the actual set is very nice. One of the most surprising things is that they have added textures over the set to make it feel like rock/stone.<br /><br />I would recommend this set to any huge LOST fan even if you do have to buy season 3 and 4 separately. In New Zealand it still works out cheaper than buying all of the seasons separately on Blu-ray and what's also great is that season 6 doesn't even come out over here until October :-D
B003E48AYC|2.0|Finally! The long awaited Alice in Wonderland  has screened in thousands of theaters across the country. Now... how was it?! Ok, I've done this a few times before and it seems to get the best response. I'll go through what I liked and didn't like about the movie.    What I liked:    'Underland':  What did you expect from Tim Burton? Seriously, was there a doubt that this man was going to make 'Underland' anything less than magnificent? The world looks and feels familiar, yet so very different. It has a very eerie, Gothic feel, that makes you just a little bit uneasy... which I'm sure Alice must feel as she enters this strange world. The colors, the animals, creatures, all amazing. I don't want to focus too much on this point... but watch the film in 2D. My wife and I watched in 3D and to be completely honest, it took away from the movie for me. So many details are blurry (a big negative to 3D), that I would rather enjoy them in 2D.    The cast/characters:  Again, what did you expect? So much talent, so many unbelievable characters it's ridiculous. Let me start with Johnny Depp, he does an amazing job as the lovable, yet crazy Mad Hatter. He has to be charming enough for you to care, and goofy enough to make you think he's nuts... without being annoying. Great work.    Helen Bonham Carter STEALS THE SHOW! She's sooo good, she's so talented, so funny I couldn't wait for her to reappear onscreen. Pay close attention to the amazing acting she does with her face alone, because her body is slightly twisted for the movie. Mia Wasikowska does great as a curious, scared, confident Alice.    The characters were mostly CGI all of which are stunning. Great to look at, great voice acting and just overall a orgasm for the eyes. Anne Hathaway... I still think you're the most overrated actress in Hollywood, 'nuff said.        What I didn't like:    The story:  This is perhaps the deal breaker for me as far as giving this movie a thumbs up approval. The story is simple, and I understand that's good for families going to see the film, but come ooooon! I don't want to spoil anything, but I promise you this... you will leave asking yourself \\"who cares?\\" Seriously, why even make the movie with such a weak story? As I was watching the film, I thought to myself, \\"oh, this happened in the 1951 Disney cartoon. Oh those characters are in the cartoon. Oh that is a cool CGI version of the cartoon.\\" There wasn't enough of a difference from the cartoon classic to consider this a true sequel, as much as a reboot with CGI. So disappointing there wasn't more meat to the story... SO DISAPPOINTING!    My own expectation:  Look, this is an interpersonal issue, and I understand that. But you're on our blog, so I'm assuming you care what we feel. I felt like I was so let down. I feel like it was such a lost opportunity to make something so special. The talent was there, the characters were there, the technology was there, but.... flat. So flat. A year now of solid anticipation and I walked out so let down.        Maybe I'm being harsh, maybe I \\"missed the point\\", but I really did feel let down. It's ok, Burton and company are going to be fine, because the movie is going to do well, VERY WELL. It was sold out 1:40 PM showing on Friday afternoon, a school day. So look for big numbers, check out the movie and lets compare scoring points.    C+  My thumb is down.
B000BEZPQE|1.0|I was told by Slipknot fans I knew that this was not a good live disc.  I tried it anyway back when I used to like this band before cory taylor went ass pussy.  Anyway they were right this is not a strong live band, they seem to go more on the stage show.
B003UYUR10|4.0|Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time  was awesome! We have all hesitated when hearing about a video game turned movie is announced, but this is an exception. As recently as standing in line for the movie, I Twittered  to the world that I wasn't all that excited about the film. My wife and I were out and about yesterday and decided to see it anyway, and we both loved it. Let me dive right into the likes and dislikes.    What I liked about the movie:  The Action  Money obviously attracted Disney to this project, but there's more to it. The action portrayed in the video games made for a very interesting concept on screen. Director Mike Newell does a magnificent job with the action. The chase scenes, the Parkour (wall-jumping), the knife fights, etc. All of the above are shot incredibly well. The pacing of the movie is great; there isn't a dull moment in the film, it's always progressing. Thumbs up to Newell on this.    The Actors  At first I thought to myself, \\"Jake Gyllenhaal with an English accent is just not going to work\\". Well I stand corrected, and Gyllenhaal is awesome in the lead role. He's physically insane in the movie and demands the spotlight. Gemma Arterton does well in the lead female role, and the chemistry between her and Gyllenhaal is great. They have a tough love thing going that works considering Arterton's role in the film. Alfred Molina gives some amazing comic relief in the movie. Not every joke, but for the most part his role is well played. Then there is Sir Ben Kingsley. At this point in his career, his name says it all. He does well considering he is surrounded by a cast half his age. Just great casting all around in this movie.    The Usually Forgotten  The scenery is grand, the sand dunes spectacular and the sets are terrific. The soundtrack is very fitting of a summer blockbuster. As were the costumes and extras. I know I'm gushing about this movie, but really, everything was well done. It has an epic feel to it, until you see the swashbuckling action, it kind of puts it back in perspective. But it has a large scale feel to it.      What I didn't like about the movie:  The Story  I know it's a Disney film aimed at families, but the story is a bit weak. It was too much of the same thing in different settings (albeit beautiful settings). The trailers pretty much give it away. \\"The dagger is important, follow the dagger.\\" Problem is, and I hate when movies do this, \\"he has the dagger, no she has the dagger. No wait, he has the dagger. Wait wait, now that guy over there has the dagger.\\" Enough!    Overall, very satisfied and would be willing to see it again if someone were to ask me. Be weary that it is aimed at kids and families and then you wont be disappointed. The action, the direction, acting and set pieces are all worth your 12 bucks. After you see it, let me know what you think.
B00007E8V4|1.0|Yes steal this because if you pay money for it you'll feel pretty stupid after you listen to it.
9991395946|2.0|I ordered this when I was a new mom for the first time. It stressed me out more than anything. I had a premie so I was unsure if I should follow the instructions or if it was different in my case. I emailed their contact information and never heard anything. A friend purchased it too and loved it. It just shows that all babies and mommies are different. If you get the book don't stress out about following it to the letter. Take it as a suggestion if you will - or just relax and follow your own instincts. I found the later to be the winner for me!

B003LAH7MU|2.0|The first cut on this CD is absolutely jarring, and most of the others left a lot to be desired.  I normally really enjoy Sting and I work for a professional symphony and attend regularly so I enjoy that as well.  This particular combination just didn't work at all for me.  Too bad as I was really looking forward to it.
0439023513|1.0|This final book is a big disappointment after such an exciting start in the first two books. I was afraid this might happen, because I read Suzanne Collins other series, Gregor and The Underland Chronicles, and it also started very strong, but became increasingly hopeless and depressing as the books progressed, ending in a very flat climax. Of course, we'll all read Mockingjay anyway, to finish the story, but it's not a fun ride. It's hard to remain interested in a story when the main character has no drive, no personality, no interests, no hope (which is so different from the first two books). Katniss spends most of the book either in a hospital bed or hiding in a closet. She's repeatedly medicated into a mindless stupor, which drags the plot to a screeching halt. The story loses its drive because Katniss no longer craves anything, except killing President Snow, which is such a distant goal, neither she nor the readers can relate to it. She just wants to hide in a corner and not feel anything. So the reader no longer feels anything. The characters we grew to love in the first two books become unrecognizable and unlikeable. Even their bonds with each other (such as Katniss's relationship with Haymitch) are weakened to the point that the reader no longer cares. The romantic tension that kept us riveted in books one and two fizzles down to nothing, and concludes in a very distant manner, so the reader doesn't feel connected to the romance at all. Rather than participating in the main action, Katniss hears about most of the main events third hand, as does the reader, so the plot feels very diluted and flat. For instance, Katniss doesn't participate in an important rescue attempt, she hears about it after the fact. I understand the need to show the despair of the characters and their situation, but after twenty-five pages or so, there needed to be a rev in the engines, some determination and drive in Katniss to get the story going again. Unfortunately, the engine stallsas Katniss is repeatedly returned to a hospital bed and an IV of sedation. I felt sedated with her. Blah. So disappointing. If the world needs saving, give me Frodo or Harry Potter, please. Not Katniss, who fizzled out before the job was done.
B000IEPFCG|4.0|It's a good watch. I seriously question that this is actually a gray-market item as it didn't come with a manual, just a warranty card. I blame that more on Seiko, they don't sell all their models everywhere, so I half expected it when I got it.<br /><br />It's just like the other SNK809K watches, but with a metal band. It's easily user adjustable, it's not a pin and collar band, all you'll need is a push-pin or a paperclip.  It's not a fancy band and does rattle a bit, but it has solid end links so it should at least stay together well.  There are 3 micro adjustments on the band, so it should be easy to size it to your liking.<br /><br />As for accuracy, it's a 7S26B movement.  Mine ran fast for about the first week or so that I had it but it seems to have broken in and is keeping time spot on now, or at least less than +/- 1 sec a day so that I can't notice it.  Since the movement is non-hacking, it's not for those very picky about being exactly correct.  There is no hand winding either, so if you're not planning on wearing it frequently be prepared to set it often.  Oh, setting the watch is easy, just make sure you get the AM/PM right on it, set the day/date a day earlier and then advance the time until it flips them and then set the time.<br /><br />Not sure what else to say. It's hard to go wrong with a Seiko 5.
0375836675|4.0|Another great book by Zusak! Ed Kennedy is one of the best main characters I've read about so far. Why? Because he's just like me and just like you. Un-fabulous and un-incredible, just your average Joe trying to survive. The story is both comical and heartwarming and Zusak's writing is easy going and down-to-Earth. As you read you can actually picture yourself as one of the guys with Ed and his friends. My only beef with this story is the rather skewed ending that didn't make a lot of sense, which is why I only gave it four stars. Despite that, I Am The Messenger is a excellent and satisfying read.
B003EYVXSW|1.0|I am an actor, and former biochemistry major. I also enjoy Adrien Brody's work, thus I was very excite the minute I saw the first trailer for this film. All I can say is what a disappointment, the story is flat cheesy and predictable, there are several failed attempts to create any sort of suspense that never develops, and the potential scary moments are killed by the chesses montage of the scenes. I will skip these one on the DVD collection and wait to see what the fall releases bring along.

B000000OSE|3.0|1991 was an important year for Guns N'Roses fans - two double vinyl albums released on the same day in September topped the Billboard chart in the first week and were followed by one of the longest tours in rock history, lasting for over two years and consisting of 192 shows in 27 countries. Use Your Illusion I brings Guns N'Roses to a new artistic level and infuses their hard rock sound from previous albums with elements of blues and country. Axl Rose's machine gun vocals stay the same and though one would feel shame about the lyrics, verses like \\"Talk to me softly/There's something in your eyes/Don't hang your head in sorrow/And please don't cry\\" and \\"Cause nothin' lasts forever/And we both know hearts can change/And it's hard to hold a candle/In the cold November rain\\" show his talent for writing ballads. The emotional \\"Don't Cry\\" is one of the greatest songs on this album, save for the slightly weird ending, and definitely one of those sweet songs that would get people to like rock and take guitar lessons. The angry and heavy sound on most other tracks would make you want to thrash your room but beware - you will soon find you cannot help but sing along to the killer chorus of Dust N'Bones and Back Off Bitch. Another highlight is moving and melodic solos from Slash on \\"November Rain which also features Axl on piano. Although a very solid piece of work from what I believe is one of the last few super rock groups, the album at a length of 75 minutes is bound to have fillers, particularly predictable \\"Live and Let Die\\" - a cover of Paul and Linda McCartney classic, \\"Bad Obsession\\" which is an unconvincing step into the Rolling Stones territory and \\"The Garden\\" featuring Alice Cooper whose presence is hardly noticeable. Despite some of the annoying moments here and there, this still makes for an essential GNR album definitely worth a listen.  --Sain Alizada
0439023513|5.0|I absolutely loved The Hunger Games and Catching Fire. I eagerly anticipated Mockingjay and am not disappointed, other than the fact the I am now mourning the end of the series. I read this book in a few days, it was hard to put down, but I got more and more bummed the closer I got to the end, because I didn't really want it to end.    I think things were wrapped up well in this book, and it provided the closure necessary at the end of a series. I won't go into any spoilers, but I am happy with how it ended. The author does a really great job painting a picture for us readers time and time again. And I personally found myself very emotionally effected at many points in the story. That's good writing! There's a really good lesson in this story as well!
B00009P1MP|5.0|No more needs to be said. I could listen to this album again and again.
0143038419|4.0|The movie got so much media attention but it ended up being a flop. I got sucked into the marketing scheme and purchased this book to read while on summer vacation. Overall a good book, but also a forgettable one. I have yet to see the movie, but I will rent it once it's out on DVD.
B003L77TZI|5.0|This ia a good pop album! I enjoy it every day when I am at work. This album will move you physically and emotionally. The album is a glorious evolution from her last album. This record showcases an artist who dares us to join her as she experiences everything she face in life. She called this album, Teenage Dream, because she felt like she always wanted to be that pin-up poster. THis album will be successful!!
0439023513|4.0|If you've read the preceding two novels in the trilogy, you have to finish it off with Mockingjay. It has that necessary closure to the series that you need. I liked how the story was unpredictable, but it was pretty violent. There were ethical questions raised about killing for war, which I think are important to ponder. Also, I think the way Katniss takes the pain of losing people is realistic and true. It doesn't show her being unaffected or able to jump back quickly, but she's a normal girl that happens to be the heroine, the mockingjay of the war. Many unpredictable revelations come about that help you better understand the characters and the government. It's a must-read. I'm going to have to read it again to make sure I got everything, but it's good to find out how the series ends. My favorite in the trilogy is Catching Fire, but I still liked Mockingjay. The writing in Mockingjay is still acurately Katniss's voice but it isn't as beautifully crafted by way of descriptions, in my opinion. Probably because she had a deadline to finish by. But nevertheless, I'd read this to gain closure and find out what happens to all the characters that you know and love.
B002ZG97RE|1.0|Movie quality is sucks. All Dark scenes look like an old movie with sand storm through screen like it was filmed by cheapest digital camera. And that supposed to be a blu ray.  As for movie itself - 2 stars, and Matt does not look same tough as Bourne series. Personally, I feel like I've  thrown away money.
B002ZG983M|4.0|Kick-Ass has an interesting premise - an average guy decides to fight crime and become a \\"super hero.\\" It starts off very poorly for him, nearly killing him in the process. But at least he gains a super hero in the process (sort of). He also gains the respect of a couple of vigilante crime fighters who make it their life to bring bloody justice to the bad guys. The ending is fairly easy to see coming, but still enjoyable enough. Some great one liners and action shots. The Kick-Ass girl makes the movie. Nicholas Cage is good too.

I am so inspired to get started on some cake pops from the book, and others i have thought up while paging through the book.  Fantastic and so much fun!!!!
0425221806|5.0|Okay, I'll admit it. Dean Koontz is my favorite actor of all time. Hands down, no contest. Why? He loves dogs, and incorporates them into his books. He can weave a fascinating yarn that keeps me up at night flipping pages (Kindle pages now). He has fun and witty dialogue. And finally, he can effectively mix horror, love, and the sense of family in every story. Watchers is one of his best books.
0765326353|5.0|I am an avid fantasy and sci-fi reader - a big fan of Tolkien, Donaldson, Eddings, Asimov, Heinlein, Lewis, Jordan and Feist.  I have been looking for the type of truly epic fantasy series that Tolkien once gave us and that Jordan and Sanderson are wrapping up... and I have no doubt that I have found that powerful of a product in Sanderson's new series \\"The Stormlight Archive\\".  Book 1, The Way of Kings, was an absolute joy of a read! How does one finish a 1000 page book and feel like the story stopped too soon? By reading Sanderson's work, that's how.  The worldbuilding is fantastic - Deeply complex, clearly presented, and compelling. The plot is creative and completely exciting - there is tons of action and numerous thrilling twists that keep the story lively and fresh.  But in my opinion, none of that matters a bit without well developed and lovable characters. In this, Sanderson knocks the ball out of the literary park. Each of the primary characters are so real, so relate-able, that the plot and world simply slide into place around them as a seamless and real-feeling whole.  I found myself laughing out loud, cheering at times, and literally crying while reading this book... much to the shock of my wife as she watched me devour this gigantic tome.  Needless to say, I rate it 5 stars, and highly recommend the Way of Kings to any fantasy readers out there.

The main character, Lin, an escaped armed robber, is discovering his soul in Bombay's slums and the village of his guide, Prabu. The reader cheers the reforming Lin, but then, in the remainder of the story, Mr. Hyde takes over. Everyone is betrayed, including the reader.     Johnny Depp may be fitting for Lin in the first third, but Vin Diesel is a much better fit for the rest.\\"

If you have a bunch of his stuff, as I did, buy this cd anyway - it's wonderful and the sound is much better than I expected. It's great that he was re-discovered in the 1960s and had a good career in the last few years he lived. Doc and Merle Watson were big fans of John Hurt - that's a pretty strong endorsement. Also, the cd booklet has a couple of nice articles written in the sixties.
B00402FGE4|5.0|With \\"Battlestar Galactica\\" all wrapped-up, I was hurting for more hard core sci-fi! \\"Caprica\\" filled that gap until the season ended. Then to my surprise a new Stargate adopted the hardcore egde! I know that some people will hate this but I cant get enough. SGU starts out a bit slow and I think that's great.<br /><br />Early on the newly formed crew is desperately trying to find out where they are and what the hell happened! They learn that they're on a ship called Destiny very far away from earth. They must also find basic recources for survival but most of these people aren't trained SG military officers. Naturally lines are drawn and alliances are made. And like BSG and Caprica, no mercy is shown. There are military men and women with guns and more guns and there are civillians. They have no guns. Guess what happens when critcal life and death descisions need to be made and one side has guns and the other does not? Yeah - It gets ugly.<br /><br />As time goes on the crew finds a new star and planet that wasn't originally there back in the day. Some of the crew decide to stick around because they think who ever created the system will help them get back to earth! Really? Mabey these super-intelligent beings dont want filthy humans pissing on their brand new planet. Time will tell!...<br /><br />I love this kind of Ultra hardcore sci-fi. Im glad to see that the Stargate franchise went in this direction and I cant wait for season 2. Wether you like sci-fi or not this show is a great buy. It's the kind of show that's actually genre bending! Is it really sci-fi or is it drama? I had to ask myself that question about BSG. What do you think?<br /><br />UPDATE:<br />The special features are top notch! It's all in HD and well put together. You get to see the actors behind the scenes as well as insight on the sets. There are also sit-down interviews with the actors, opposite the producer and creater, to discuss the psycology of their own character(s)! But for me seeing the actors outside of their charaters was eye opening. The most drastic difference was with Louis Ferreira.

B001FB563E|5.0|I was introduced to this genre when I bought \\"Blindness\\"! I had no idea I would fall in love with such darkness. In this flick a father and son have a plan to get to the coast but the problem was in the fathers choice in how to get there. They followed the road and they encounter some rather deadly problems. Just when they think they caught a break they're forced to run and hide. Cannabalism being the greatist threat that pops up in terrifying fashion.<br /><br />The child in this movie is an increadible \\"Aussi\\" actor who will have a very long acting career! Check out the special features and listen to the commentary and you will understand just how good he is! Viggo is amazing as well. They both had to be at their best because they were the only 2 faces you see for about 90% of the movie. Their perfomance are powerful. You want so bad for them to make it but as I said in my title, this movie is merciless. Everything doesn't go the way you might want it to go. I adore the painful realism and more movie makers should watch carefully and learn something.

It's a great idea, and within a few days of reading this book I was able to integrate the idea in presentations to my associates.

This is not a book on theoretical business concepts, the content of this book demands to be implemented in every business strategy meeting. It is more than that. It is a \\"fun\\" way to play with different scenarios until the right solution emerges.
B003JTHETY|4.0|Iron Maiden has re-invented themselves by growing more progressive the past ten years, and this has won over many new fans. The Final Frontier will not disappoint.    The highlights:    Satellite 15 (the intro) is one of the most progressive things I have ever heard Iron Maiden do - and it is amazing, as it is structured with eerie diminished and jazz chordings. But then, look out, because once The Final Frontier chords kick in the song turns into a straight ahead Iron Maiden classic.     El Dorado - I have found that this song is best listened to back to back with Satellite 15/The Final Frontier. El Dorado seems out of place when listening to it by itself.     Mother of Mercy - contains a very memorable guitar melody.    The Alchemist - a fast tempo song that, with it's harmony guitars, has a Killers album feels to it. One of my favorites.     Isle of Avalon - this song fits right in with the songs of the past ten years. Clean sounding guitars that evolve into a distortion classic.     The Talisman - another of my favorites, this is a story of being at sea - starts slowly and evolves into a very fast tempo song.     The mission edition case is made of fragile tin that is easily bent. I'd avoid it and get the standard cd.    Overall, The Final Frontier has slighty different feels to it from song to song, but it should satisfy most anyone that enjoys the band.

The technical aspects (especially SeasonPlay, which bookmarks wherever you stop watching; even if you put in different DVDs, when you pop in the disc you were watching, the scene picks up where you left off!) are all top-notch and the extras -- both on the DVDs and the physical pieces (like the game and ankh) -- as well as the packaging itself, are all great collector's items that make this box set well worth the money! Now I can't wait for the release of the [[ASIN:0756665949 Lost Encyclopedia]], which will be a much-used reference when any questions pop up.

B000W91RUG|5.0|THE SHOW ITSELF:  The show is great.  You have one super genius by the name of Sheldon who's mal-adjusted socially which creates friction and humorous situations with his roommate Leonard and anyone else he talks to.  Leonard is also socially awkward and inept in certain situations, but he fares much better off then Sheldon.  Rajesh is astro-physicist who simply cannot talk to girls directly, by some pathological \\"defect\\" in his mind.  Howard on the other hand is the engineer who could be considered a social opposite of Rajesh.  He hits on women more than he should, and what's considered a disgusting manner to some of the ladies he meets does create humorous situations for the audience.  Rajesh being Indian and Howard being Jewish also creates extra material as well.   They're on the level, and the writers didn't overdo those types of jokes.  The last of the major characters is Penny, the new apartment neighbor.  She's nowhere near the same book smarts as the other four, but her being better socially adjusted and how conversations go with the other 4 characters is another source of entertainment.    As one would expect from the nature of the show, there is much in the way of references to geek pop culture as well.  Sci-fi flicks such as Star Trek, Star Wars, The Time Machine, Planet Of The Apes, and Lord of the Rings; and comics such as Superman and the Flash are among some of them.  Those are rounded out by actual references to science (Schrodinger's cat, Oppenheimer Theory, etc. )    In short, Sheldon's character is terrific, but everyone else also does their part in creating an hilarious TV show that's both entertaining and believable.        THE DVD ITSELF:  You get all 17 episodes of season 1.  Oddly enough, the only spoken language available is English.  Usually, French and Spanish are options, but I suppose it would've been too difficult to translate the 'geek speak' into those languages?  What's also odd is there are also Asian languages available as part ofthe 7 different languages for closed captions.  English, French, Spanish, Portugese, Chinese, Korean, and Thai.    There's also a special feature in where the show's creators talk about the details of putting the show into production.  Some of it includes the original version of how the show was going to be and comments about the actual physicist they have on-call for all of the scientific references and its accuracy.  Every one of the 5 main cast members also speak briefly about the characters they play.  You also learn about what other shows/work the actors did previously, what they like about being in The Big Bang Theory, and how some of these characters relate to people known in real life (e.g. there's someone like Rajesh with that type of speech pathology!).    The box comes with an insert that lists all of the episodes as well as a brief description.  There really isn't that much else in ways of material things or extra features, but at least the show is good, and they're all priced accordingly, compared to other TV series DVD box sets which are much more expensive, but some of them do feature more bonus material/episodes.

0452284392|4.0|As some other reviewers have said, it could be condensed, but then that would rob [Linked] of its fun and engaging narrative tale.  Barabasi takes readers on a trip through the history of thinking about networks, from regarding them as absolutely random and undifferentiated, to discovering their fascinating, rule-bound deep structure.  Power laws, scale-free topologies, disparate nodes --> centrally important hubs, and all the relationships and ramifications therein are discussed with great interest.  Most enjoyable is Barabasi's writing on the application of theory to those networks that hit closest to home for us layfolk, and we learn that Hollywood actors, board directors, the AIDs epidemic, growth and proliferation of the Internet, and research citations are all susceptible to the science of networks.<br /><br />Fun and non-technical read!  Definitely worth picking up in this age where Facebook and friends are bringing new meaning and significance to our understanding of \\"Networks\\".  Anyone hoping to start to understand just what the Net is doing to our private, economic, and social worlds ought to give [Linked] a shot.

Learns he has cancer and thinks, well, I'll just sell meth.  Hm.  I don't see the psychological or economic basis.  And that absence lingers throughout.  The first season leads to that dreadful scene in the drug merchant's lair...with lots of bad acting and that ridiculous explosion.  This is stuff for adolescent boys of a certain ilk.  But Cranston is terrific.
030745455X|5.0|This is the second of the three part saga by the late Steig Larrson, about Lisbeth Salander, the young, socially challenged computer hacker and Mikael Blomkvist the investigative journalist and takes off where [[ASIN:0307454541 The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo]] ended.  I read the first book on my Kindle and immediately downloaded this one and started reading as if it were just the next chapter.  I liked this book even better than the first because the Lisbeth Salander character was my favorite and this book gives us a closer look into her background although much is still in question by the end of the book.  Nonetheless, we begin to see some of the reasons that she is so introverted and such a free spirit.  We also see Blomkvist back in his office at Millennium after taking close to a year off to write a book and solve the mysteries in The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo.<br /><br />I don't want to give away any of the storyline, not that it would be easy to do so since this book, like the first is very involved with lots of twists and turns.  There is lots of mystery, suspense, and thrills throughout the book.  If you've read the first book you probably already like both of these characters as well as some of the supporting cast such as Erika, Blomkvist's boss and sometime lover and others in the Millennium office.  You'll like them even more after reading this book as you learn more secrets about them and more of the reasons why they believe and act as they do.<br /><br />I went on to download [[ASIN:030726999X The Girl Who Kicked the Hornet's Nest]] on my Kindle immediately after finishing this one and I think I have to say that this second book was my favorite of the three.  It's such a shame that the author suffered a heart attack and died in November of 2004.  He was so talented and he undoubtedly would have written more wonderful books like these three.
B003KUSUG8|5.0|This is a CD that needs to be bought. Any Eminem fan will need to add this to their collection. Every song on the album is worth listening to. There are no bad tracks. Every song says something (and as usual Eminem talks about a range of things- from his addictions to Proof's death to Hip Hop today). Although there are some songs that are just great like \\"Space Bound\\", \\"Almost Famous\\", or \\"No Love\\" feat Lil Wayne (and also the singles \\"Not Afraid\\", \\"Love The Way You Lie\\" and \\"Won't back down\\"), all of the songs are something to beat your head to, all of them you have to listen closely to or you'll miss something. His lyrics are on point and as usual he provides the lyrics in the CD booklet. This is a CD to listen over and over.

B00005JNJV|2.0|Batman Begins is exactly what it sounds like, the early years of Bruce Wayne/Batman and his motivations. The film tries desperately to be more than what it really is, an okay action film.     Christian Bale is the perfect choice for Christopher Nolan's Batman and I am not saying that like a good thing. Bale is a totally un-charasmatic and bland actor who does little more than brood. His Bruce Wayne is not much of a human being, he is a machine operating on vengance. The real tragedy of Batman is that he is destined not to have a normal life in his persuit of his rather un-obtainable goal. Not once during this film do you feel that he is split, he simply has a one-track mind goes down one path. Not much genuine character development ever occurs, it's really just Bruce Wayne learning how to fight and then later acquiring his gadgetry.    When Bruce finally dons the mask, it's an introduction of an action film character and not so much a myth or a legend. True Batman uses fear and confusion to defeat the crowd of thugs by lurking and picking them off one by one; I wish I can only say the thugs were confused because the poorly shot fighting bewildered me as well and it's sadly evident through out the film. This again a case of trying to be \\"realistic\\" in a film that certainly needn't bother itself with such concerns. Batman is suppose to appear in full view of his victims so they, and the viewer, could absorb that he is the creature of the night come to attack his prey. Of course this could not work with this particularly banal costume Batman wears, it's really meant to conceal one instead of appearing as a theatrical figure; Totally wrong for film or comic books.     As for supporting cast, a lot of talent here is wasted. Liam Neeson is cast as the main anatognist as a very banal Ra's Al Ghul. Al Ghul, in the comics, was depicted as larger than life figure who is looked up to by his minions as a god and speaks like a biblical figure; He posses fantastic wealth and power beyound the common man due has lived longer than any human being in history. He wants to rid the world of man entirely so he can restore to it's natural beauty. This underwhelming counterpart in Nolan's film is little more than an angry man who lost his wife. Like Wayne, simply a machine for vengance but simply takes it one step further. Neeson does well with a banal role and the same can be said for Cillian Murphy. Murphy is not as boring as Al Ghul but he certainly is wasted. He plays a creep with burlap sack over his head, dubbed Scacrecrow, fascinated by fear and uses a gas to induce fear among people but he really is used as a tool in this film for Al Ghul's plot to destroy Gotham. I would like to have seen Scarecrow as a genuine threat but he fails to be as much when he only successfully has one victim that no one has sympathy with. Finally we come to the allies and there isn't much to go on here. Everyone here is just \\"meh\\". Alfred and Rachel Dawes spout prentension about Bruce's obligations every five secounds and Gary Oldman does a good job as a young Jim Gordon not having much else to say because everyone else pointed out the obvious but he does do so at the end. Oh and Lucius Fox played by a Morgan Freeman on auto-pilot was a nice touch for some decent humor.    Now does this film hold up ? Not very well. The action is badly shot and editied, when people fight or get shot it's all in a blur. This seems to be the popular thing in film, bad presentation, but I don't see the appeal. The plot is incredibly stupid and worthy of a lame James Bond feature. Ras Al Ghul wants to use the Scarecrow's fear gas by dumping into the water supply and evaporating it into a gas using some giant Microwave Emitter. When you care about nobody in the film, it dosen't help too much to try and cobble together some silly ticking time bomb plot. They should have taken the time to make Batman an actual flesh and blood character and gave people credible dialogue which dosen't constantly hammer themes in. I love Nolan's formula of close ups, the banal Hans Zimmer score blaring, and then tossing in some fortune cookie sayings to make the film intelligent. Sorry Nolan, it didn't work on me. Let actions speak for themselves and let the audience decide.     Overall, this is an okay action film but if you want great Batman films, look no further than Tim Burton and Bruce Timm's freshman Bat outings.
0439023513|5.0|Mockingjay was definitely the hardest book to read because it's so depressing, but I think it was Collin's intention to create this feeling of sadness and loneliness while we read the book because we needed to understand how Katniss must be feeling after all that has happened in the last two books and finally see her for who she really was....a damaged young girl. I also think Collins tried to show us the reality of the kind of story we were actually fans of, which was a story about murder, death, poverty, cruelty and corruption. In Mockingjay, I tried to find some sort of happiness or light in this dark story world where Peeta is captured, Katniss is a mess and the rebellion everyone risked creating is barely making any progress at all, but since there was hardly anything worth being happy about, like Katniss did in those dark times, I just kept going forward. Til the end I couldn't even imagine how this trilogy would end and while many readers might have been angry at it's conclusion, I thought it was perfect. It ended how it should have ended.
B000Q9IZ5C|5.0|After over 1,200 five star reviews I am pressed to say something unique about Joss Whedon's 'Serenity'. Fantastic movie that followed a wonderful sci-fi western called 'Firefly'. The crime is that 'Firefly' was discontinued after eleven episodes, not unlike the 'Babylon 5' off-shoot, 'Crusade'(another show that did not get the run it deserved).<br /><br />As others have said, 'Serenity' transcends genre and is an emotional, visual and operatic treat. A rare and unique gem in sci-fi movie adventure. It's a complete picture and does not require that you've seen the show, although there are plenty of treats for 'Firefly' fans. Collector's edition has a nice enclosure, some great extras and scenes, including some interviews. Overall, a fun movie with great characters that you will watch again and again.

0143117564|2.0|In the editorial reviews of another Pynchon novel, Amazon included this blurb from the Seattle Times: \\"Like Bruegel's painting 'Landscape with the Fall of Icarus,' [Pynchon's novel] is a portrait of mankind's attempt to transcend our mortality--or at least push up against its very edge.\\"  Woah! Duuude! Heavy, huh? And there are many other such panegyrics which proclaim how profound Thomas Pynchon's novels are.<br /><br />Very well. I shall attempt no judgment as to the validity of this view. Some people apparently think he's the greatest, greatest since Urlugal, and maybe [[ASIN:0143039946 Gravity's Rainbow]] is the one document that future generations will study when trying to understand the society of this era.<br /><br />But \\"Inherent Vice\\" is not at all profound, and it doesn't attempt to be. It makes no attempt to probe the fabric of our society, and -- unless you think that it's important to observe that all cops are sexually-frustrated morons (the bad guys) -- there's no social message whatsoever to be gleaned from this novel. (If you disagree and instead believe that this is a novel with a deep message, allow me to suggest that you've been spending too much time tied to the Huffington Post.) (Reference to Allman Brothers song.)<br /><br />It's a farce. It's meant to be a rollicking romp with babes in bikinis, LA hipsters, dopers, cheaters, six-time losers, and girls by the whirlpool, lookin' for a new fool. Yeah, that's it precisely. This is Pynchon's attempt at writing [[ASIN:B000026BCX Subterranean Homesick Blues]] into a novel.<br /><br />Cool! Groovy! Uptight and out-O-sight! But does it rock? Most important, IS IT FUNNY?<br /><br />Let's put it this way:<br />It's about as funny as if Eminem were to release a comedy album.<br />It's about as funny as if [[ASIN:1400031257 Thomas Friedman]] were to start writing Doonesbury.<br />It's as funny as if [[ASIN:B000005HD4 Cecil Taylor]] had joined [[ASIN:B000003ELA Spike Jones & His City Slickers]] (reference to a musical group that Pynchon is said to admire).<br /><br />It's about as funny as a rubber crutch in a polio ward.

B001OST0LW|4.0|I won't review the plot, etc.  Read other reviews for that information.  I just want to make some observations about the movie.<br /><br />Batman Forever (1995) is a pretty good flick.  In the two previous films which Tim Burton directed, Batman (1989) and Batman Returns (1992), the tone was dark, gothic and semi-campy with dark and evil villains.  The suits decided they didn't want Tim Burton to direct another Batman movie after Batman Returns got criticized for being too dark and depressing for little kids to watch and that it was mostly for adults.  So Tim Burton exited and in came Joel Schumacher as director.<br /><br />Schumacher lightened the mood, literally.  Batman Forever is brighter, more colorful, and loaded with bright colored lights throughout the movie.  It is very much like the first season of the campy 1960s TV series, which was in 1966.  That first season was the best because it was the least campy of the three seasons, but campy nonetheless.  The show got more campy in the second season and even more campy in the third and final season.  Batman Forever strikes a middle ground - it's a mix of seriousness and camp that can appeal to kids and adults alike.  The villains, while evil, were on the lighter side compared to the Joker, Penguin, and Catwoman from the Tim Burton films.  Whether this was a good change after the first two movies is a matter of personal opinion.  Personally, I like the first two movies the best, followed by this one, and then Batman & Robin (1997).<br /><br />I think the acting in this movie was good overall.  Val Kilmer played a pretty good Bruce Wayne and Batman.  Chris O'Donnell was pretty good as Dick Grayson and Robin.  Jim Carrey did a good job as the Riddler and put his own brand of humor on the character for the most part.  He was very intense and over-the-top all the time.  If he would have turned it down a notch, his performance would have been a little better, but it was still solid nonetheless.  I think the best Riddler ever was Frank Gorshin from the TV series and Batman: The Movie (1966).  Gorshin had a great laugh and just enough intensity without going overboard.  I think they wanted Carrey to be Gorshin-like to a certain extent, and he was, but overall he was vintage Jim Carrey.  Tommy Lee Jones as Two-Face acted well, but he wasn't exactly like the character is supposed to be, which is serious and tragic.  Instead, he was funny, laughed a lot, and not exactly serious.  Nicole Kidman was alright.  Michael Gough turned in another solid performance as Alfred the butler.<br /><br />Overall, this is a solid movie that is worth watching even if you just want to see Jim Carrey and Tommy Lee Jones.  If you don't mind some camp and you can accept the huge change of atmosphere compared to the Tim Burton movies and judge the movie on its own merits, you might like it.rshin from the TV series and Batman: The Movie (1966).

B0013FDM7E|3.0|Writer Richard Matheson is probably best known for his contributions in the science fiction and fantasy genres.  Among his works made into films are, Somewhere In Time, What Dreams May Come, and Duel, which featured Dennis Weaver pursued by a mad truck driver.  His story I Am Legend, is perhaps his most influential work.  The story is about a nightmare world, where save for one man, the human race have become vampire like creatures.  The first adaptation of Matheson's novel was [[ASIN:B0002HODU4 Last Man on Earth]] (1964) starring Vincent Price, followed by [[ASIN:B001E8AMA0 The Omega Man [Blu-ray]]](1971) starring Charlton Heston.  Another remake was the subject of speculation for some time, before finally becoming a reality with Will Smith in the lead role.<br /><br />(Spoilers ahead, so proceed as you will)<br /><br />Directed by Francis Laurence, I Am Legend (2007) is set in New York in 2012, where a drug intended to cure cancer has mutated, and instead killed most of mankind.  The survivors have become \\"darkseekers\\", vicious zombielike creatures, with skin sensitive to UV light.  They dwell in the shadows by day, and run wild at night.  Robert Neville (Smith) a virologist, together with his German Sheppard Sam, have the run of Manhattan, and spends their days performing routine tasks, and hanging out at the South Street Seaport, hoping to find other survivors.  Neville retreats to his home before sunset, to keep his location a secret from the darkseekers.  There in his basement laboratory, he performs research hoping to find a cure for the mutated virus.  How Neville's family is killed in an accident is told in flashbacks, but how things got so out of control, isn't really addressed.<br /><br />The empty cityscape is in the early stages of decay.  Almost immediately, the atmosphere of emptiness is established, along with the special relationship between Neville and his loyal companion.  They work as a team, sharing a strange life of solitude.  Exploring this relationship, one of the film's best moments comes early on, when Sam runs into a dark abandoned building while chasing a deer, and Neville enters to try and find him.  Here we glimpse the darkseekers for the first time, and witness their brutal strength.<br /><br />Needing a subject to test a potential cure, Neville utilizes a falling car in a trap that captures a female darkseeker (who appears to have had breast enhancement?).  Observing her capture, a male darkseeker (Dash Mihok) becomes so agitated that he risks death trying to reach Neville.  In several ways, this incident is a pivotal turning point.<br /><br />Solitude has taken a toll on Neville, affecting his behavior and sanity.  He drives madly through the streets in pursuit of running deer.  At a video store he speaks to mannequins that are setup in the store.  Later, when cruising the streets, he sees a mannequin standing in the street.  He stops his car, and belligerently yells at the dummy, then shoots it up.  He is then literally hoisted on his own petard, when he is caught in a trap, that utilizes a falling car.  This misfortune leads to a soul crushing loss that changes his world, and pushes Neville toward suicidal acts.<br /><br />The film's third act is very problematic, as it concludes in two radically different ways.  About to become a victim of the darkseekers, Neville is miraculously rescued by a woman named Anna (Alice Braga), who is accompanied by Ethan (Charlie Tahan), a young boy.  They escape in Anna's vehicle, but unfortunately are followed by the darkseekers back to Neville's home.  Anna says she is on her way North to find a group of survivors.<br /><br />The following night, the darkseekers mount a massive full scale attack.  Neville has some elaborate defense measures in place, but the opposing force is overwhelming.  For being so prepared, Neville strangely has no backdoor escape route out of his home.  In one version Neville sacrifices his life, to provide an opportunity for Anna toescape with a possible cure.  In an alternate version, the captured female darkseeker is returned to her clan, and Neville is spared.  Later Neville, Anna, and Ethan head out of the city, hoping to find other survivors.  Version one is featured on the single disc release, while the second version is included in the two disc and blu ray editions.  Presenting a fatalistic vision devoid of hope, would probably have been box office poison, so it is understandable that the second more optimistic ending was chosen.<br /><br />The computer generated darkseekers look fake, moving like super powered robots.  There is a social structure with some kind of leadership, however what it may be is not clear.  The leader may the same character, but who can really tell?  Neville's attempt to reason with them when trapped in his lab, is curious.<br /><br />This updated take has some good points, with the special effects a major contributor to the film's look.  As little time is given to Neville's family life, the darkseekers, or Anna and Ethan, it is his relationship with Sam makes the strongest impression.  When this ends, largely due to Neville's mistakes, it rips a big chunk out of the heart of the film.  Facing death, Neville is literally dragging his ass, when he should be making tracks, wounded or not.  Sadly, it is Sam who pays for his errors.<br /><br />The void is quickly filled with the introduction of Anna and Ethan, but they are strangers who the audience has nothing invested in.  The battle on the dock is contrived and fake, as is the subsequent way over the top mass attack.  Tack on the dual ending, and you have a third act that derails what was a pretty decent story.  I Am Legend is still worth seeing, preferably in formats with the alternate ending..  In an alternate version, the captured female darkseeker is returned to her clan, and Neville is spared.

6304712944|5.0|What may be one of the most unjustly maligned movie musicals ever made, Joshua Logan's sumptuous \\"Camelot\\" stands a lot better in a world where the genre is effectively dead. It was instantly reviled upon release in 1967. The reality is, however, the film had a wonderful starring performance by Richard Harris, incomparably beautiful scoring by legendary Alfred Newman-- whose lush, dreamy arrangements beat the tar out of Franz Allers' sharp and stuffy orchestrations from the original Broadway version-- and sets and costumes that are far more impressive than anything James Cameron could conjure on a computer. \\"Camelot\\" has truly fascinating moments all over the place. It has both warmhearted comedy and stark drama. Laurence Naismith (Merlyn) and Lionel Jeffries (Pellinore) are the other standouts of a mostly top-flight cast. As for the actors' performances of the songs: all of the movie versions are more engaging than those of the original cast album. Richard Harris' Arthur is vibrant and human, while Richard Burton was fairly lifeless in his intonations. As Guenevere, Vanessa Redgrave lacks the vocal powers of Julie Andrews, but then I could never believe Andrews in the role. And the Lancelot songs (dubbed by Gene Merlino for Franco Nero) are much better in the film than Robert Goulet's shut-up-and-listen-to-me-sing showboating. And the DVD is terrific: a new-looking widescreen transfer of the film's breathtaking imagery, for instance. The disc also includes some truly fascinating documentaries of the period-- overwhelmingly sad considering the optimism they express for the film's reception-- a whopping five trailers, if you like seeing how classic films were marketed, and a mislabeled \\"music-only\\" audio track that features some rather distracting sound effects from the movie and should have had the vocal performances, as well. I mean, \\"Little Shop of Horrors\\" had one like that! Anyway, don't believe all the bad things you read about this \\"Camelot.\\" Expensive? Yes. Overblown? Not in the slightest.

B001QTXM5Y|5.0|I was excited when Watchmen - 2 disc Director's Cut/Special Edition finally arrived, I'd never seen it before, never read any of the comics, didn't know what to expect but knew instinctively that I would like it.  I wasn't wrong.  My wife was concerned with the length but I didn't care.  It took me a little bit to figure out what was going on (I'd read reviews and story plotlines before watching it so we wouldn't be completely in the dark, but still...), but once I got into the story, I didn't want to let go.  I thoroughly enjoyed this movie, I'd like to watch it again but it'll be awhile before my wife will want to see it again and I don't like watching movies by myself.  This movie stuck with me, made an impression on me for several days after we'd watched it, not too many movies do that to/for me.  It definitely appealed to both the adult and the little kid in me.  You really need to pay attention to what's going on but the payoff is great.  I'm glad I bought this movie, and this version of this movie, I was most definitely NOT disappointed.  -kd5-

B000YI7MRM|4.0|The movie is beautifully shot, cast, and produced.  It is a first-rate historical romance and can be thoroughly enjoyed on that level.<br /><br />But the producers have tried to condense several plot lines from different Alatriste books into a single story and overall I would have to say they fail.  Wherever the book stays in one place, for example the battle scenes in Flanders, it is fabulous.  But these leaps and shortcuts are distracting.  \\"Wait a minute\\", i find myself saying, \\"that's not what comes next!\\".  And what about the bit with the inquisition?  Since the books have been translated to English very slowly I saw developments in the latter part of this movie that I haven't read yet (spoiler alert) -- two minor things (!) are Inigo's love affair and Diego's death!  Thanks a lot guys...<br /><br />But overall I think they did an excellent job of capturing the spirit of these books, part swashbuckler, part historical fiction, part character study and they deserve at least 4 stars.  If they'd had the good sense to stretch their material, and their filming, into a trilogy like Jackson did with TLOTR it would have been perfect.  Too bad so few have caught on to that wonderful production idea --- Viggo should have brought this up!<br /><br />BTW, the acting is fabulous.  When Alatriste and Malatesta first meet, even though engaged on the same side of a merecenary cause they perform a splendid little ballet of danger.  Each recognizes the killer in the other and they circle for position and distance as they  negotiate walking through a door.  They are two loaded springs appearing to be nonchalant and polite.  Subtle and splendid.

B000006EAP|5.0|Seventh Son of a Seventh Son is one of those rare records where everything happened at the right time and the right place to deliver a stellar concept album of epic proportions. Brilliant, roaring guitar sounds, silky, layered synthesizers, punchy bass lines, melodic drumming, and soaring, voluminous vocals blend here into what sounds like a never-ending daydream. All this is topped off with cover- and booklet art that takes full advantage of the concept and transports the listener into a wholly different world. The story of the seventh son is loosely based on the book Moonchild by the British occultist Aleister Crowley. It follows the birth, rise, and fall of the mythic creature that, according to the legend, and by dint of being born seventh son of a seventh son, has powers to heal and see into the future. The beauty of the storytelling on the record is that the story can be interpreted on many levels. In the foreground we have the story about the seventh son. On another level the lyrics tackle themes of insanity, fear, life, death, reincarnation, religion, the good-evil dichotomy, meaning of life, love, and morality. Though laden with heavy doses of the occult, the lyrics manage to avoid paganism, which makes each verse the more accessible to a wider range of listeners. Moreover, biblical references and vivid metaphors abound on this record, flourishing the open-ended story-telling experience with a touch of the esoteric.    When it comes to concept albums in rock history, few bands have managed to pull them off with any notable success. Among the more fruitful efforts are Queensryche's Operation: Mindcrime,\\" W.A.S.P.' s The Crimson Idol, and Pink Floyd's The Wall. Seventh Son of a Seventh Son is, however, widely regarded as the most consummated concept album in rock music history both artistically and commercially. It is the only one in the genre that is perfect in every aspect, of which one is that the songs can be heard in any order and be enjoyed individuallywhen they're taken out of the context. All four singles that were released with the album had made it into the Top Ten of UK charts and had stayed there for weeks.    With a story as complex as that on the album, there is still wide disagreement about the correct interpretation of the story and the apparent timeline. Below is my personal interpretation of the songs in the order in which they appear on the record.    Moonchild--Lucifer opens the story by threatening the pregnant mother of the seventh son to not give birth to the baby, but she ignores him and commits suicide after the delivery of the baby. For this, Lucifer vows to damn her even if she tries to repent and beg forgiveness in the afterlife.    Infinite Dreams--the father of the seventh son (or possibly the seventh son himself) is having constant nightmares in which he hears screams (probably voices of people from the doomed village in The Prophecy) and experiences flashes of the afterlife. Although the dreams scare him, they awaken a deep curiosity in him and begin to make him wonder where he might ultimately end--in heaven or in hell. This song may be about the mounting fears the father of the seventh son is having for his son.    Can I Play With Madness--the seventh son, now a young man, plagued with frequent visions and nightmares, seeks out a prophet to find out whether he really has the powers that occur to him in his dreams. The prophet lies to him out of fear of the young man's powers and mocks him for asking such nonsense. The seventh son, disappointed and angry, upsets the prophet by calling him a liar and making threats. The infuriated prophet stops to fix him \\"with a freezing glance\\" and tells the young man the truth, that he is damned and his soul destined to \\"burn in a lake of fire.\\"    The Evil That Men Do--Lucifer sends a woman (his daughter) to tempt the young man and take his innocence. By committing the sin of the flesh, he is now flawed. He realizes this as he sees the Book of Life open before him after having slept with the devil's daughter. Yet, he falls in love with her and discovers deep feelings and emotions for the first time in his life. He feels how difficult it is to have loved and lost, and wishes he could see her again.    Seventh Son of a Seventh Son--this sonic spectacle that clocks in at over nine minutes is the centerpiece of the story. Here we witness the birth of the seventh son and how the seven sons before him are closely watching the young man's progress and his internal struggles in deciding whether to use his powers for good or evil. In the final verse, we learn that the seventh son is a chosen prophet with powers to heal. This last verse also suggests that the seventh son's ultimate destiny may be to use his powers for good ends.    The Prophecy--having learned how to use his special gift, the seventh son tries in a desperate attempt to warn his village of an impending disaster, but the people accuse him of being a fraud. After the village is destroyed, its superstitious inhabitants blame the rising prophet for bringing the curse onto them and expel him from the village.    Clairvoyant--the seventh son's powers are now rapidly growing with each day. With the possession of great psychic abilities and power comes also the fear that he might not be able to control them anymore. In what transcends the story itself, singer Bruce Dickinson memorably delivers the metaphysically potent chorus, hammering it word for word by reminding us that \\"there s a time to live, and a time to die, when it's time to meet the maker.\\"    Only the Good Die Young--this final chapter in the story takes on moral dilemmas and insists that while \\"only the good die young, all the evil seem to live forever.\\" The song explores the last reflections of the tragic prophet. He ironically observes that he could have stopped the passage of time and given good people eternal life, however, he blames religion, hypocrisy, and the Book of Life for eliminating thatpossibility as he says \\"If I could cancel tomorrow, the undead would thank me today. Fly in the face of your prophet, I mock your morality plays. The moon is red and bleeding, the sun is burned and black, the Book of Life is silent--no turning back.\\"    Seventh Son of a Seventh Son marks for Iron Maiden the culmination of a classical era that was driven by a quest for formal perfection. The instrumental work balances lavishness and minimalism, applied deliberately only where they belong. Every verse is crafted to fit perfectly into the musical structure. The playing is purposeful and all instruments work together as a whole, weaving everything into silky sonic textures that are destined to flatter our ear membranes.
B002NXSRX4|1.0|I'm sorry I couldn't find anything at all to like about this film.  This has to be the absolute King of those blockbuster films that love to hurl all sorts of poorly edited CGI filled action sequences at the viewer and hope that no one will notice the complete lack of coherence, character development or plot.  Yep, this is WORSE than TRANSFORMERS 2, TERMINATOR 4, 2012 and all the rest of the overbudgeted underwhelming nonsense the studios love to crank out.  There just wasn't anything to enjoy here. I loved GI Joe as a kid but this film has no genuine relationship to the GI joe stuff I grew up with.  Thats fine if the film makers had bothered to change it into something thoughtful, interesting or entertaining.  They didn't.  It's just one gigantic incomprehensible action sequence after another and for me, that isn't enough to make a film worthwhile.
0439023513|1.0|The Katniss you grew to love and admire is nothing more than a crazed crack head, a self-loathing morphling addict.  Peeta spends most of the book in tracker-jacker withdrawal, and Gale indirectly had a hand in killing dozens of innocent children.  Do yourself a favor: stay away from this book and hold on to the fond memories you have from Books 1 & 2.
B000M341RI|5.0|Times are hard for six men who were laid off when their Yorkshire steel mill closed and now they're desperate for money.  A one-night Chippendales show comes to town and is a big hit, so they decide to make their own strip show, and to make it more interesting they'll go completely nude!  The men are neither big and buff nor good dancers, but they put their hearts into preparing for the big night.<br /><br />This absolutely charming comedy has many touching moments, thanks to the well-developed and sympathetic characters we come to know:  One is a divorced dad (Robert Carlyle) who needs to raise child support money, one is an overweight and depressed husband (Mark Addy), one cares for his aging mum, and one (Tom Wilkinson) hasn't had the nerve to tell his credit card-happy wife that he's been out of work for six months.  All of the actors are perfectly cast and it's worth the price just to see the venerable Wilkinson bump and grind to \\"Hot Stuff.\\"<br /><br />Gritty location photography and a lively, Oscar-winning disco soundtrack help create the mood of despair giving way to hope.  The North country accents and slang are sometimes unintelligible, but that in no way detracts from the fun.  This fast-paced and sweet film was made with a tiny budget but went on to break UK box office records.  Highly recommended.
B004132HZS|5.0|One of my top favorites, great acting, directing and writing.  each episode is almost 2 hours long and it gives enough time to develop the story and characters,    I hesitated when I saw the series was in modern time, but very soon after I forgot completely and accepted the change, come to think of it that made it even more enjoyable and easier for me to relate as viewer.     Excellent series, I am beyond happy to see it return next year, and I can assure you then it will end in my shopping card too.
B003HARV3Y|3.0|From the title it looks like a Young Adult film (didn't know it was based off of a YA book series) and I was expecting something with production values like Harry Potter or even the Spiderwick Chronicles -- that didn't happen. The story was a bit too fast paced, the acting a bit canned, and the scripting kept me expecting a commercial break. This would have been better as a pilot for a TV series as it could have been fleshed out a bit more.
B00006ZXSK|4.0|When my daughter put this on, I was skeptical, to say the least.  Oy, I thought, another bad romantic comedy.  Well, I am happy to report that I was dead flat wrong:  this is a funny, intelligent take on a an old story and it really works.  The actors are uniformly excellent and the story is even somewhat believable.  Cinderella is a tough smart chick, the prince is rebellious and open-minded, and Leonardo is a wise manipulator.  This is a really fun watch, witty and with good values and not stupidly unrealialistic or blankly politically correct.<br /><br />I recommend this for family watching.  There is something in it for everyone.
B003A4IFGY|5.0|I'm not a Tom Petty fan.  I have a few of the CDs he's put out throughout his career but most of his mid career music I have found to be unoriginal and overly simplistic (Running Down a Dream).  But I still like a few songs, particular his music that features minor keys and organs.  When he has ventured into blues (\\"It's Good to Be King\\"), he's had some interesting outcomes.  The MTV years were most definitely his least creative in terms of music with the Heartbreakers (Traveling Wilbouries is a different story... ).<br /><br />So I see Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers on SNL this Spring and I'm absolutely floored.  Where did that guitar come from???  That outrageous Jimmy Page sounding Gibson Les Paul???  And the organs.  It sounded like there were ten Hammond B3s playing.  Slide guitar, deep organs, contrasting melodies.  Oh, and Petty's vocals... pure blues rock and roll.  I couldn't believe it.  Both songs (Jericho and I Should Have Known It).  If I closed my eyes, I could swear I was listening to Jimmy Page on I Should Have Known It.  Wow.<br /><br />I downloaded this album, and it is unquestionably the best work he and his band have ever done.  Petty has said that they are playing for themselves.  Keep doing that... don't play for us anymore!<br /><br />The mood of this album is late 70's stoner.  I can't think of another way to describe it.  Several songs discuss marijuana and pot growing (Trip to Pirate's Cove, Let Yourself Go, High in the Morning, Don't Pull Me Over... get it?).  And there is a slow, bluesy stoner groove to this whole disc.  Lots of competing melodies and improvisation.  This album reminds me of some of the later work by the Grateful Dead (West LA Fadeaway) and The Allman Brothers (everything).  There are a few songs that have the Led Zeppelin/Page sound too.  One that has a break that sounds like Heartbreaker revisited.<br /><br />Most songs on this album are excellent.  One or two weak or questionable tracks, but this is an album - buy the whole thing.  I have found myself listening to it as a playlist for a two months, and I'm still discovering new things.<br /><br />I would love to see Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers performing an unscripted show with ABB or the Dead.  They sound like a jam band.  They sound pure.  They sound sincere.myself listening to it as a playlist for a two months, and I'm still discovering new things.

B0028RXXFC|5.0|HBO's ROME is absolutely riviting.  Spellbinding.  True to life.  The research.  The reality.  The passion.  And following the stories of the two soldiers...  it's spectacular.

I am absolutely stunned by the aesthetics, the vigor, the attention to detail.  It is a MUST-SEE!  Fabulous.  Give yourself a treat.  Watch them all in order.  Spellbinding is the word.  Well done!  Thank you, producers, for such amazing entertainment.
B000002BBY|3.0|I remember this album coming out several years back but have only recently purchased it.  I've been familiar with the songs, but just focused on other genres like jazz and blues and \\"classic\\" rock, Motown etc.    The songs are quite good and there are moments of brilliance here and there, but the album is so horribly produced as to make this album quite difficult to listen to, even causing ear fatigue.  The vocals are often occupying the same frequency range as the guitars creating a harsh smear of sonic clutter, the drums on some tracks are soft and indistinct and despite the appearance of initial spaciousness with the reverb levels, the dynamics and air are stripped away with too much compression.    Perhaps I should have grabbed this CD when it first came out before I knew what good production was.  I will continue to pull this out for a song or two because I really like the music, but Owen Morris and Noel Gallagher should have left the production to someone else to do proper justice to the quality of the songs. Not everyone can be Jimmy Page, The Beatles and T-Bone Burnett all rolled into one.
0374531269|3.0|Overall, this book was well written but there was a tendency to gloss over details/time periods and the ending was quite abrupt.
0439023513|5.0|It has been a few days since I finished \\"Mockingjay\\" but I can't get it out of my head.  I bawled my eyes out at the ending for so many different reasons.  I know this will impact the targeted teen audience but as an adult, I really struggled with the morality of the Hunger Games and the Panem and its policies in general.  The idea of anyone believing its ok to send our children into a fight for the death, televised for our entertainment nonetheless, is revolting and disturbing.<br /><br />I understand why a lot of readers aren't happy with the ending.  Its a credit to the strength of the world that Ms. Collin's created that readers have become so emotionally attached to the story.  Also, there is an old saying that no readers experience the exact same story.  How one person wants things to turn out can be completely different than the next person even though the facts of the story are presented the same way.<br /><br />The story was heartwrenching and the story isn't left without casualties.  Its a war these people find themselves in and Collins doesn't shy away from the grittiest, nastiest aspects of war.  Again and again we see children presented as pawns in the war in many different ways.  This isn't an easy book to read.<br /><br />I loved Katniss.  She has quickly become one of my favorite characters in literature.  She is strong and does what she has to do.  She wants to protect everyone and yet knows thats impossible, so she focuses on protecting those closest to her.  She has always had to fight for food for her family to survive on and has never had time or money for luxuries.  Even though she hates the games and what they represent, you see her enjoy the luxurious foods and beautiful dresses.  For the first time ever she is experiencing these things.  I thought that was a realistic touch.<br /><br />Katniss has grown up with Gale as her best friend but left him behind when she had to participate in the Hunger Games.  There she found she could save herself and maybe Peeta by faking a romance between them.  This is the first love triangle where I think I loved both boys equally.  Collins also does a great job making both boys unique.  Sometimes in novels you have two characters that are about the same age and the same gender and they could be interchangeable because the are written flatly.  Not here, again a boon to Collin's writing.  The choice fans have been waiting for is finally made here, and of course readers are going to be upset.  But the reasons for Katniss's choice of one boy rather than the other is realistic, if painful.<br /><br />I am finding it impossible to really write what I want to about this novel and why it meant so much to me.  To do so would possibly ruin the book in some way if you haven't read it.  There is so much to think about after you have read \\"Mockingjay\\" that I believe you won't soon forget this one.

0441013597|4.0|I have read very little sci-fi, but have been curious to explore the genre. My husband and brother-in-law, both sci-fi geeks, recommended DUNE as a must-read that has in many ways become the gold standard for science fiction. Although the hype may have created overly high expectations for me, I did get engrossed in this epic otherworldly adventure.<br /><br />On an unforgiving desert planet called Arrakis (aka Dune), the young Paul Atreides inherits both his betrayed father's planetary fiefdom and a bitter feud with the rival Harkonnen family. But there's another dimension to the story: Paul is rumored to be the Muad'Dib, the messiah figure Dune's inhabitants have been waiting for.<br /><br />What makes DUNE remarkable is Herbert's intricate creation of an alien world. The reader becomes immersed in the imaginative details of Dune's ecology, mysticism, politics, and culture. The planet itself is a hellish world nearly devoid of water and home to massive, fearsome sandworms. Yet it is also of great value for the interplanetary empire it belongs to, since it is the only source of \\"m&eacute;lange spice,\\" a mind-expanding and life-extending drug. Economically, the empire is dominated by the CHOAM corporation, which plays an important hand in the power struggles between noble houses.<br /><br />I truly enjoyed delving into this imaginary empire. Although set many thousands of years in the future, the civilization Herbert conjures is a surprisingly anachronistic one, resembling a medieval feudal society. Despite the importance of the female Bene Gesserit religious sect (often feared as witches), women play a subservient role to men. Even combat is a futuristic version of fencing. Dune's indigenous inhabitants--the Bedouin-like Fremen (Herbert mixes in a lot of Middle Eastern linguistic and cultural influences)--have a fascinating culture shaped by their arid environment. In this culture, water is so precious that moisture is harvested from the dead, and to shed a tear over someone is a profound honor. The Fremen treat their planet almost as a complex living organism and survive by living in harmony with it rather than trying to bend it to their will. Perhaps Herbert's representation of this intricate desert ecology contributed to the budding environmental awareness of the mid-60s.<br /><br />As immersive as DUNE is, the fiction I usually like best is character-based, and it was here that I found the novel lacking. There is some interesting character development in Paul, who matures and is affected by his status as the rumored Muad'Dib. But the reader never really gets in the characters' heads, and there is a dryness to Herbert's narration.<br /><br />After reading DUNE, I certainly plan to pick up some more sci-fi in the future.r.

B000063UR2|4.0|Be aware that Legend and Legend Ultimate Edition are completely different items, but you'll still find mixed reviews as if they were a single item.<br /><br />At first I bought Legend (which I then returned) with the idea of getting the version of the movie with the soundtrack by Tangerine Dream, but sadly this item I chose was the wrong one.  Only the Ultimate Edition includes the 2 DVD pack with both versions of the movie that some reviews talk about.<br /><br />The movie is really fascinating if you like fairy tale-like stories, thou it is not intended for children.  The Tangerine Dream soundtrack enhances the experience of the movie, and yes, both versions differ a little bit, the US version is a little bit more explanatory.<br /><br />If you're somehow curious about the movie let me say that it's worth to have, it's a very uncommon item, not many people know about it and that makes it interesting in a way, I'd say a Diamond in the Rough, and it really entertains.  Make sure you buy the Ultimate Edition to get the whole pack of extras, which adds some value, specially to those not familiar with the movie at all.
B002ZG997C|1.0|A near total waste of time for Denzel Washington and Gary Oldman, both of whom have done much better in the past. Eli is predictable, derivative, and ultimately way too preachy. The movie plays like some kind of teenager's video game, with Denzel lopping off hands, running through a dozen people at a time with his super-sharp machete, and using hand and shotgun to blast away about twice that many more whenever he's threatened. Of course throughout all of this Eli gets away with nary a scratch, at least until the silly plot demands that everything be pulled together in a certain way, no matter how unbelievable it may be.<br /><br />Gary Oldman as Carnegie looks mad throughout (and really quite oily)---not much of a change from his last few performances. Remember Bram Stoker's Dracula? See that for a fine Oldman performance. Not many do weird as well as Gary O. But in Eli...feh! Who cares what he says or does. Jennifer Beals is completely underutilized, and Mila Kunis as Solara is almost instantly forgettable as Eli's roaming companion. Check the ending (if you make it that far), where for lack of a better plot device Solara inherits the mantle. Gotta keep things going, after all. The Word must get out. Again, unbelievable and dumb.<br /><br />In sum, I couldn't help but wonder if the need to fit in all the religious stuff got in the way of anyone's thinking that it just might have been religion that caused all the devastation in the first place. Guess we're supposed to believe that the torch must be carried not matter what.
B003YP0BI4|5.0|I've been a Maiden fan since I was a kid, and I'm now coming up on my 40th birthday.  This album blows me away ... the tightest songwriting I've heard from these guys in ages (sounds like a strong Adrian Smith influence, if you ask me).  The best array of guitar sounds they've ever had.  The usual bass and drums mastery from Steve Harris (one of my heroes) and Nicko.    Powerslave is still my fave Maiden album, but this quickly rises to #2, and that's saying something.    Just buy it, kiddies...  And UP THE IRONS!
B0015ABRE2|5.0|This set has been reviewed extensively so I won't get into too much detail except for why I gave it 5 stars. It's usually around the third season that shows tend to decline. That's when you see a whole bunch of reviews saying it should have ended. Fortunately, I don't feel that way about this show. Actually, the third season kicks things up a bit with Rita discovering she's pregnant with Dexter's baby. It is a very self-revealing season for Dexter. If you haven't gotten in on this show yet, hop on board!
0307463745|5.0|This book is a must-read for anyone in college, looking to start a business, or trapped in the rat race.  The ideas presented in this book are essential to a successful business in today's world.  This book is worth 3 times its price.
B000Q6GUW0|5.0|This set has been reviewed extensively so I won't get into too much detail except for why I gave it 5 stars. There are a lot of repetitive shows out there, about 100 regarding vampires, another hundred crime or law shows, etc. Yes, this is a crime show but they put a spin on it like no other. A serial killer who kills serial killers, rapists, murderers, etc? Awesome. The narration is actually amusing. The storytelling is amazing. I love it. It gets my 5 star vote.
0439023513|1.0|The first two books were so amazing but this third one was AWFUL.  The people are nothing like they were in the first two books, the story is sad, and I actually felt depressed when I was done reading it.  The author ruined the entire series with this third book.
B000V86OKG|5.0|This set has been reviewed extensively so I won't get into too much detail except for why I gave it 5 stars. The second season continues to deliver on one of the most original crime dramas I've seen. They get further into Dexter's history as well as more detail on Harry. The characters continue to amuse me and everything overall is great.
0765326353|5.0|It's been a long time since I've come across a fantasy novel that has truly blown me away - but Sanderson's \\"The Way of Kings\\" definitely fits the bill.  I've read his other works, but although I throughly enjoyed his other novels, this book completely blows them away.   I received the book just today and devoured it in one sitting (eating as I read) - yes, it's that compelling!  I could rave on indefinitely, but I'll make things simple: this is a must-read for lovers of epic fantasy.  If you're looking for something original and groundbreaking, do yourself a favor and pick up \\"The Way of Kings\\" today!
B003ITZBVI|5.0|This will be short, & to the point:  Animation - Excellent, no complaints at all.    Story - Some will try to compare it to the the comic books, & you just cannot do that. Did this movie do the job of relating the story as best it could: Yes, it did!    Voice Casting - Good & Bad. This always gets to me with these WB productions. For a company that has the excellent voice talent they already have with Kevin Conroy (Batman/Bruce Wayne) & Tim Daly (Superman/Clark Kent) just to name two actors, why do they feel the need to hire anybody else to do the job? With Batman: U.T.R.H., they did a decent job of getting most of the new voice casting right for this production: Bruce Greenwood, & Jensen Ackles voice Batman & Red Hood. Both actors do a great job, Greenwood even sounds like Kevin Conroy's Batman voice, so though he did a great job, why not just use Conroy? Voice failures go to John Di Maggio - the Joker, & (I hate to say it) Neil Patrick Harris - Nightwing. Di Maggio's Joker just is horrible, and he sounds bored reading his lines. Harris' Nightwing is just too goofy sounding. He makes a good Flash, but not Nightwing. Everyone else does a good job with their characters.     So that's it! I highly recommend this movie, and not just for Batman fans. If you like a good action/adventure drama, then you should like this!
B001EAWMGA|3.0|A spaceship crashes into the lake of the 8th century Norway, and the only surviving traveler Kainan (James Caviezel) is captured by the Viking warriors. Kainan, or the \\"Outlander,\\" explains to their wise king Rothgar (John Hurt) that the recent massacre of the nearby village is actually caused by the \\"dragon,\\" or a predatory creature Moorwen, that he accidentally brought with him to their land.    \\"Outlander\\" blends the genres of science fiction and Scandinavian epic poem. The heroic story of Beowulf, the warrior fighting Grendel, is given a twist. Its \\"dragon\\" is not just a fearsome monster to be killed; it is an extraterrestrial life form with a surprisingly complex background. Also, the story has a heroine, a brave and strong one. Sophia Myles is Freya, king's sword-wielding daughter and romantic interest for Kainan.     \\"Outlander\\" is based on an interesting idea about the origin of the dragon legends, but battle scenes are just acceptable, and as action adventure the storyline is largely a standard one. The film departs from the formula in explaining the back story of Kainan and Moorwen, but the film moves on before it really gets interesting.     The screenplay has one or two too many subplots: Kainan's rivalry / friendship with Wulfric (Jack Huston), a warrior who is supposed to be heir to the king; an orphan boy named Eric; romance with Freya and the furious rival king Gunnar (Ron Perlman), who thinks that Rothgar is responsible for the deaths of his clan. None of them is fully explored, and Ron Perlman's character is sadly wasted.    Probably the most unique aspect of \\"Outlander\\" is Patrick Tatopoulos-designed creature Moorwen and its suggested history. Kainan and Moorwen (and later two Viking kings) share certain tragic back story. But to visualize the story of this scale, the film needs more budget. I know I shouldn't be asking too much, and the set of the Viking village and their costumes are very good, but the creature and the fight scenes need better effects.     \\"Outlander\\" starts out as a unique mixture of genres, but cannot sustain its unique nature very long.
B003LAH7MU|3.0|I have a lot of Sting's music in my collection. Including most of the Police albums. This is okay to listen to, but the arrangements left me wanting more. Not sure if it is because they are not different enough from the original, just an orchestra added, but there isn't any one song on this CD that makes me say \\"Boy, this was worth buying!\\" It is still pleasant to listen to, and I have enjoyed it several times on my commute.
0060558121|1.0|I loved Good Omens. I think Neil Gaiman is also pretty cool. But I don't like his books including American Gods and Anansi Boys. American Gods, is a modern fantasy novel. It's gritty. If you like modern fantasy, you may like this book.<br /><br />Admittedly, I do like the Percy Jackson series which is modern, kids fantasy. But it has a very strong theme of heroism. Of saving the day. Which is what I really like about fantasy.<br /><br />Good fantasy is about the world crashing around, and then someone finding their own special way to save it. Of course the world must contain elements of, and generally the saving must be done in a way, that we can't explain using science through magic or some other medium. Fantasy should be immersive. Some philosophy, maybe even something dark or dichotomocially brilliant comedy, and immersive character transformation is what separates great fantasy, from good fantasy.<br /><br />This isn't good fantasy.
B0013FSL3E|4.0|WALL-E is about the most unconventional animated feature film you will likely ever encounter.  It's strange, it's moving, it's powerful, and it's pretty darn spectacular.  Realistically speaking, this shouldn't come as much of a surprise considering this is big-budget Pixar/ Disney all the way, was done by the director of Finding Nemo, and boarded by the creative storytellers behind Cars and Ratatouille.<br /><br />By now you've read that there is bare minimum dialog in this picture and it is the first of its kind to integrate live-action segments with computer generated imagery.  It's set in the distant future on a nearly unrecognizable earth and humanity, in an evolved state of disability no less, doesn't even make an appearance till the latter portion of the film.  A majority of the lead character's interaction exists between a silent robot and a cockroach and yet despite these areas (or perhaps because of them), WALL-E delivers heart-warming entertainment in spades.<br /><br />The plot takes place approximately seven hundred years in the future, and finds the earth over-run with garbage/ devoid of plant and animal life; the consequence of years of environmental degradation and thoughtless consumerism.<br /><br />Humans, apparently having run themselves right off the globe, are now living on a self-sustaining spacecraft known as the Axiom after vacating Earth some centuries earlier. The plan, it seems, was for humans to vacate the planet temporarily while cleaning robots prepared the earth for re-colonization. However, after seven hundred years of working tirelessly in a harsh environment, all of the robots have deteriorated and broken down except for a single small cleaning robot, a \\"Waste Allocation Load Lifter Earth-Class\\" to be exact: WALL-E.<br /><br />WALL-E spends his days compacting trash into solid blocks and building massive structures out of these cubes to await removal by harvester robots that are no longer operational. The film flawlessly displays the reality that the lonesome little robot collects some of the more interesting artifacts he uncovers in the trash and keeps them in the back of a broken down truck that serves as his home. At night he watches a clip of \\"Hello Dolly\\" he recovered through a VCR he wired to an iPod with dreams of sharing his weird little world with someone, anyone else.<br /><br />His life makes a remarkable change after countless years of loneliness when an enormous spacecraft touches down and deposits another, much more advanced robot, EVE (Extraterrestrial Vegetation Evaluator).<br /><br />Nominated for and winner of dozens of awards, Wall-E manages to depict more heart and elicit more emotion for its speech impaired title character than a majority of modern dialog-rich motion pictures combined.  Due to the combination of near-flawless pacing, direction that blends photo realistic backdrops with lovely character models, and a sound score (including effects by Ben Burrtt), WALL-E harkens back to capture a feel that can only be compared to some of the soaring achievements of early silent films.<br /><br />About the only complaint to the entire film that may resonate some consideration is that young children may find the entire premise/ presentation a bit too tedious for their rapid-fire attention spans.  This is a film that relishes subtleties of the human condition over slapstick or abundant humor attempts.  A certain level of maturity is expected to fully appreciate the prose, meaning older kids and adults will find much to love here.<br /><br />Even going into WALL-E with enough hype to raise even the humblest of expectations to the point of disappointment, I still came away amazed at how well Pixar has mastered the subtleties of capturing emotion in their works.  Considered the founders of the whole computer generated animation movement, it's evident with each Pixar production that remaining the leader of the genre is no fluke.tle robot collects some of the more interesting artifacts he uncovers in the trash and keeps them in the back of a broken down truck that serves as his home.

B001974DG0|5.0|Dean Koontz is a tough author.  His books can range from absolutely amazing to seriously disappointing.  Thankfully, Watchers is an absolute gem - and by far the best book that I have read by him.<br /><br />Waters is about a super-intelligent golden retriever named Einstein.  He's escaped the lab where he was given his abilities, but unfortunately something else escaped also - the Outsider.  Also the product of laboratory experiments, the Outsider is a twisted and dangerous ape-like creature.  The Outsider rips the eyes from his victims' faces, he's disgusted with his appearance and doesn't want anyone to look at him.  The Outsider is hunting Einstein, and Einstein knows it.<br /><br />Einstein is adopted by a down-on-his-luck good guy named Travis.  Together they interact with a social outcast named Nora, a bad guy abuser Arthur, and a deadly assassin named Vincent.  This cast of characters blazes through an absolute page-turner, twists and turns around every corner.  You won't be able to wait to find out what happens next!  If any of this sounds interesting to you, then Watchers is definitely worth your time.
0374158460|4.0|Freedom by Jonathan Franzen is a truly rewarding book.  It is so rare to find a genuinely good writer these days, that we ought to celebrate every of their efforts.<br /><br />In recent times, two guardrails have been established, it seems to me, beyond which lies the writerly abyss.  On the one hand the profane, badly written, misogynistic fare in The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo and absurd treacle on the other in Eat, Pray, Love.<br /><br />In Freedom, Franzen achieves the sweet spot between those two guardrails, and accomplishes what a good novel should do - give us fully formed characters (whether we actually like them or not).<br /><br />The opening chapter of Freedom is not like the rest.  Its style is almost like a report, a journalistic report.  Looking back, one realizes that the author has established a number of markers that evolve throughout the book.  But it is difficult to spot them in the first reading, since they are so integral to the narrative itself.<br /><br />The second chapter is a tour de force.  It is in one of the three main characters Patty's, voice (only). This chapter fully explores her personality and psyche and is a beautiful explanation of the markers that were laid out in the first chapter.  You develop enormous empathy with Patty, not because Franzen is yanking emotional levers, but because of where the character is placed.<br /><br />The middle part of the book fully explores the main characters.  Clearly there are primary and secondary characters in the book.  Because this is a novel and there is room to breathe, everyone of them is given a chance to grow, explore and express.  The character of Walter (Patty's husband) grows from a sketch of an eccentric and cranky individual to a fully formed human being one can relate to.<br /><br />As the book was approaching the end, I was filled with a tad bit of anxiety.  Here was a very recognizable world that Franzen has created, but with a depth that we fail to perceive as hurried live-rs of our lives.  In the last chapter, Franzen clearly had a choice.  He could have opted for any trajectory - comedy, tragedy, or guns blazing.  But to my utter delight, he allows the world that he has created (and observed) develop organically.  There is an internal logic to his plot that has a trajectory - and he lets the trajectory build without blocking it.  In Mihlayi Czitzenmihalyi's prescription, he finds 'Flow' not only for his writing but for his characters - a twofer!<br /><br />Some observations on the writing itself:  Somewhere in the middle of the book it occurred to me that Franzen explores psychological and relationships terrain only.  What I mean is that his characters find themselves in NY, MN, DC, abroad.  But he never writes anything about the surroundings.  Any other writer would record the sights and sounds of the environment and be evocative.  Franzen (willfully?) ignores this and saves all his energies for character development.<br /><br />Also, his language is contemporary.  Sometimes in a riff, he gets to poetic lines.  But then again reverts to the journalistic and the banal.  If I had one complaint, that would be it.  The language he employs is not consistently spectacular.  It is uneven at best.  A good summary might be that his ear for the language is contemporary, no more no less.<br /><br />The title of the book Freedom, is more than appropos.  The theme is freedom.  The plot is about freedom.  And the characters are about exploring freedom.  It is also a poke at our thoughtless use of the word in modern society sometimes.  It is also a meditation on what the word really means.  The novel gives plenty of scope to explore this in cynical, aggressive, ruminative and psychological terms.  A real reward for the reader.<br /><br />Is this a great novel?  Is Franzen a great writer?  In the blush of reading this terrific novel, I am most tempted to say yes enthusiastically.  Then in a sober moment I think of Coetzee and Naipaul, and have to conclude not yet.  But clearly Franzen's writing trajectory is headed in the direction of Coetzee and Naipaul.  And I can't wait!<br /><br />In the meantime please run, buy and read Freedom.on of Coetzee and Naipaul.  And I can't wait!    In the meantime please run, buy and read Freedom.
0205632645|5.0|I purchased the fiftieth anniversary edition of \\"William Strunk Jr. and E.B. White, The Elements of Style\\". It is a little hardcover book, beautifully bound in black and gold, and well enough made to last beyond this generation. So it should. To me, it is a valuable treasure. I learnt English Grammar during the nineteen-fifties in Australia, but today there seems to be no such subject. Such a tragedy. But this little book is much more than grammar. It tells how to use our language, and it tells it with great authority. It is the sort of contribution that will help save our beautiful language from the decline that is becoming evident everywhere we look. Any aspiring writer, in fact every writer should read this book, and read it often. It produces an amazing sense of confidence. My writing style evolved instantly as a result, and I admit to a certain faint redness of cheek sometimes when editing my latest work. Buy ten copies to give as gifts. You will be doing the world a favour. Kind regards.
B003M0H4NG|4.0|This review is for the DVD only.  The music on the CDs has been written about extensively for 40 years but the few out-takes are great discoveries from the vaults.      The DVD is a satisfying 70 minutes long and encompasses an entire performance by the Miles Davis Quintet of November 1969, in Copenhagen.  The public wouldn't hear the recorded Bitches Brew material for several more months.  At this time Miles's band consisted of Wayne Shorter on tenor and soprano sax, Chick Corea on Fender Rhodes, Dave Holland on acoustic bass, Jack DeJohnette on drums and Miles himself on trumpet.  This is an artist in the midst of a great transformation.  Gone are the suits of respectable jazzmen of the mid-1960s and in are the clothes of the hippy generation but not to the degree that would come in the following years  when Miles would adopt his Sly Stone-type look.  The music is almost entirely original, with only a short performance \\"I Fall In Love Too Easily\\" making it into the set.  The only electric instrument present is the Fender Rhodes, which Chick Corea is becoming comfortable with at this point.  This performance is a taste of what's to come in the next few months.  This seems relatively tame compared to the Live at the Fillmore East from March 7th, 1970.  That's why this is such a great document:  A well-recorded video performance of a band that was changing every few months.  The Isle of Wight concert from the next summer is even more unbridled, albeit with a few changes in the band.    The video quality is very good.  The sound is good, except that the bass is mostly absent. It sticks out in some places but it's hard to hear (sorry Dave Holland fans).  Overall it's a great presentation.  The performance is top notch.  A transitional step into Miles' electric age.  This would be worth it for the DVD alone.    I did some casual comparisons of the Complete Bitches Brew Sessions CDs versus this.  The differences were not vast.  They both sound very good.  The Bonus DVD and the (2) out-takes in this set make it worthwhile and a good buy.  The \\"super deluxe collector's edition\\" coming out later this month looks enticing but not for the cash. This seems to be the best bargain.  I'm hoping that the 3rd CD in the collector's edition set is released on its own in the future.
B0019N8P2W|4.0|It`s strange, when I was in high school I didn`t like this show.  Now the more I watch it, and relate to it, the more I like it.  This was an excellent buy. I could not be more happy with it.

0971407614|5.0|I FINALLY found a bodyweight exercise book that gives me what I was looking for!  I have several bodyweight exercise books including some of Navy Seals exercises.  All of them have exercises that start at too high a level for an out of shape beginner and don't give good instruction on how to set up your own exercise routines.  It's as if the authors have forgotten what is is like to be out of shape.  This book is different!!<br /><br />This one, however, includes exercises that a true beginner can actually perform in a way that will enable them to progress.  As you build up strength, there are more difficult forms that allow you to smoothly progress all the way up to Navy Seal fitness!  The other thing I like about this book is that many of the exercises are unique to the author who was a Navy Seal fitness instructor.  When the Gulf Wars broke out, he helped to figure out ways to  build a supreme level of fitness faster using the latest research in fitness and strength training while retaining the \\"no equipment\\" philosophy of the Navy Seals.<br /><br />You are Your Own Gym gives detailed instructions on how to perform the various exercises and how to progress with them.  It includes general instructions for developing your own routines, and also has excellent 10 week routines for everyone from the out of shape beginner to the advanced Navy Seal level.  No equipment is needed other than the items that are available in any hotel room, like a door and a table.<br /><br />This book is truly different from everything else I have seen.  Outstanding isn't too strong a term to use for it.<br /><br />I originally bought this in Kindle format, but after reading it and trying out the routines that are laid out in it, I decided that I needed to get it in \\"real\\" book form too!  I'll take the Kindle book with me when I travel and will use the book at home to plan out future routines.
193413712X|5.0|One reader said that President Obama came across this book in a book store.    I did also, and bought it based on the first page.   Finished reading it now, I am in awe of the intelligence, the depth of understanding, the mystical journeys, the deep sadness of the book.   I could create a longer list of reasons that I would read this book again, but others have said it.    I was happy to find so many reviews; I was desperate to talk about it, to share it, to think more about it.     It is a challenging book, not one to read casually, but with serious and devoted intent.   There were many passages I had to read slowly, almost aloud, as I would good poetry.  Then, when I would finish that passage, and find its connection to the stream of narration, I would read it again.   Some passages took three readings, and I found more in each one, never resentful of the author's demands upon me to think.    I was mesmerized by the spiritual and transcendental treatment of a man's relationship with nature.  So many scenes in the forest, where life truly was.     I saw existentialism in it, both in the slow descent of George's death, even surrounded by those who truly love him, and Howard's wanderings and wonderings in the forest, away from an unloving, even hostile home.    The denouement could have been sentimental or cliched, but it is not.   Howard's finding of his son happens long before George's death, keeping the scene satisfying and completing the mysterious and formerly unapparent circle of the narrative.      This is a book I will not donate to the local library.  This is a book that deserves a nameplate and exploration for its beauty.     I want to sit down and TALK with someone about this book.  I cannot get it out of my mind and heart.   It haunts me, and I am glad it does.

1891252089|5.0|I have been practicing yoga for 10 years and have always loved ashtanga.  I have been wanting to practice outside of classes and this book is perfect. Swenson explains the poses very well, and shows modifications.  I love the short forms-helps me create a practice on the days that I am short of time.     This is definitely not a book for beginners. Ashtanga yoga is a very intense, athletic style of yoga that can intimidate most beginners.  I also don't recommend that you learn these poses on your own.  Rather, go to an ashtanga class and have an experienced instructor teach you.  Use this book to complement classes.  I go to yoga class 1-2 times a week, and use this manual on other days of the week to maintain my 6 day a week practice.  I use the explanations as a reminder of the order and how to do the postures correctly.
0316172324|4.0|I find it funny that people say this book is not as good as the Tipping Point. My opinion is the exact opposite. I found the Tipping Point laborious and smacking of pseudo-science. In comparison, Blink is a really good read and deals with science much better. Gladwell does have the gift of translating studies and research into a cogent narrative.
B00005N5S2|3.0|This movie, in short, is very inconsistent as far as movie quality goes. The 1970s production values are clear, but I don't hold that against the film; it's the overall \\"B-movie\\" feeling inherent in the production. I've seen older films that were beautifully done. This wasn't. In some respects it was excellent; in others, downright awful. Let me elaborate.<br /><br />First, the acting. Some of the actors are just too affected. Gregory Peck as MacArthur, Marj Dusay as the general's wife, and Sandy Kenyon as Jonathan Wainwright (in a limited role) were among the few strong performances that were genuine, powerful and believable. Many of the other acting performances, such as those that portrayed President Roosevelt, and President Truman (the actor spoke much faster than Truman ever did) are affected and over the top so much as to be laughable and produced a cringe or seven. Other acting segments were horrendous as well. Time after time, I noticed scenes where I thought to myself \\"people just don't talk like that. Only actors trying too hard do.\\"<br /><br />But that wasn't always the case. It tended to be more prevalent in the camraderie scenes, with average troops. To be fair, those roles weren't filled by great thespians--they were just bit players. But the director didn't step in and prevent these abominations of film. And anytime a viewer gets that feeling, as I did, it's just bad moviemaking.<br /><br />On to the positive. As mentioned earlier, Peck and a few others were excellent. But where I thought the film shines was in some of the more intimate, serious scenes. One example was the scene where, after MacArthur returns to the Philippines (\\"I have returned\\"), and visits the survivors of the Bataan Death March. It was a powerful, well done scene. So was the escape from Corregidor to Australia early in the movie, and the Korean War scenes near the end were quite good.<br /><br />While bad acting does sometimes stick out like a sore thumb, it's not the only thing I judge a film by. So what else was good? Well, the photography was first rate. It's difficult to view a period piece and get the real feeling of actually being there. This film allows for that feeling. Overall the DVD quality was good, too.<br /><br />Back to criticism. There were factual errors I noticed immediately. When Truman and MacArthur meet on Wake Island to discuss Korean War strategy, MacArthur is shown saluting Truman as the president descends the stairs. The problem? It never happened. It's actually one of the more blatant examples of MacArthur's real life hubris and a relatively well known incident. So why did the filmmakers put it in? Creative license? I think not--it was a glaring omission. Another major error was when the MacArthur character (Peck) was briefing the President (FDR) in Hawaii, in an otherwise good scene portraying his effort to convince FDR not to not bypass the Philippines prior to an invasion in Japan, points to a spot on the map that is actually closer to Manila or Subic in the West, but says \\"Leyte,\\" a place that is actually on the complete opposite side of that country's territory--on the east. Splitting hairs? Possibly, but imagine seeing a movie where someone says \\"here in New York City\\" but points to San Fransisco! So I think this just illustrates my point about the carelessness of the filmmakers and therefore, the B-movie like feeling one often gets.<br /><br />All in all however, I enjoyed the movie, distractions for poor quality notwithstanding. I've recently developed an interest in the Pacific War and MacArthur himself, and for that reason and that reason only, I found it a worthwhile two hours spent watching the movie. I may even watch it again. In other words, I recommend this only for people genuinely interested in the subject matter and who want to watch a dramatic re-enactment of the events. For others, however, perhaps people who want to be entertained by a WWII film, it's difficult to recommend.<br /><br />The bottom line to me is, this is a good but flawed film about a great but flawed man in a very fascinating time in history.a great but flawed man in a very fascinating time in history.
B002ZG98C8|5.0|And none of the action is phoned in either. Machete starts off with a bang, or a slice. Dispatching more drug lord henchmen than most movies have.<br /><br />Machete is ripped from the headlines plot featuring illegal immigration over the U.S. Mexican border. Machete (Danny Trejo) is a former Mexican Federale whose family has been killed by drug lord Torrez (Steven Seagal). Machete is in the U.S. as an illegal day laborer who is hired to kill an unprincipled state Senator (Robert DeNiro) trying to make a name for himself. Machete discovers that he's been set up by Booth (Jeff Fahey) who is playing both sides of the immigration issue. As Machete careens from one side to another falls in with Jessica Alba as an ICE agent, and Michelle Rodriguez as a leader of a Mexican underground railroad. But don't let the issue fool you. It's there just to set all the characters in motion and there's no \\"hidden\\" message or agenda to either side of the argument. Characters on both sides are creepy and don't even manage to do the right thing for the wrong reason.<br /><br />All the performances are matched for the actor. There is no great range or nuance to the characters but there doesn't need to be. All the action is over the top and all the characters have to do is deliver, and deliver they do. Danny Trejo as Machete, the always stoic hero who never flinches when faced with gun, sword, bomb, or girl. Steven Seagal's usual one note performance and shoe polish hairline are still visible, but it's the right note for the character. Don Johnson as a vigilante, killing people crossing the border is a combination of Marlon Brando and Robert Duvall's characters from Apocalypse Now. DeNiro's character is the only one I thought a little subdued and I thought there would be more to the character. But DeNiro is a smart enough actor to be able to match his performance to the material. Jessica Alba as ICE agent Sartana, able to fight and make arrests in the highest of heels.<br /><br />Robert Rodriquez turns in another of his hands on productions. Rodriguez did everything from writing and directing the movie, to editing, to the soundtrack. It's clear that Rodriguez has studied the exploitation genre. He has the camera movements down, the jump cuts, he acknowledges and uses every clich&eacute;, but they're used smartly and some times have a little snap or twist on them. Such as in a show of trust when Machete turns over a gun to Jessica Alba's ICE agent but she knows he took the clip out. Rodriguez's tongue is planted firmly in his cheek. The violence is beyond cartoonish and frequently delivered with a humorous twist. It's also good to see a filmmaker willing to bring nudity back into a movie, and not the Kathy Bates type of nudity. In one topless scene with Lindsay Lohan I think we can all say `all is forgiven Lindsay.'<br /><br />Machete is a popcorn munching good time!r of his hands on productions.

0793542049|5.0|Ed Friedland is an excellent instructor and this is another excellent title to his credit. He starts out slow and explains the technique. The CD recording is also helpful.<br /><br />While the book is no substitute for an instructor, it is an excellent reference to learn on your own.<br /><br />Some of the reviewers criticized this book since it does not have TAB.  So maybe this is not for those who don't read music other than tab.<br /><br />Nevertheless, Ed Friedland gives you the essentials for learning walking bass lines in this book.

B003P2WO5E|5.0|I was a long time Wheel of Time fan before I ever heard of Sanderson. I picked up his books the day before they announced he would be finishing the series. I've driven myself insane re-reading The Wheel of Times (9 times). Why am I telling you this? Because after I read this book my reaction was I want Sanderson to stop writing the last 2 books of WoT and finish the second one in this series! No other author creates a politically tense environment in a magically rich world like Brandon does. His originality is beyond comparison. This is the book that will have you shaking with anticipation multiple times! I received the ARC and bought 2 hard cover copies, and the e-book version as well. If you enjoy epic fantasy at all, this book is the future!
0439023513|5.0|This book took me completely by surprise.  It was not the ending I expected, nor wanted.  Yet it worked.  My thoughts and quibbles, in no particular order:    ***Spoilers***  First and foremost this was not a romance novel, although there was romance in it.  To me, who Katniss was going to choose was irrelevant.  But in saying that, it was always Peeta.  And for the record, IMHO, Peeta chose Katniss.  Katniss was in no coherent shape to choose anyone.  I felt that Gale was more an older brother, cousin, or hunting buddy. He liked and cared about her.    The ending was very confusing and not spelled out adequately.  I think we, the readers were to go by our assumptions,   1)  Why was Prim at the Capitol?  How did she get there?  2)  Why did Katniss say \\"Yes\\" to a new Hunger Games for the Capitol's children?  Did she only say Yes so that she could assasinate Snow?  3)  Did Katniss always intend to assassinate Coin instead of Snow or only at the at the last minute?  4)  What was Gale's motivation?  Did he want a prestigious position in the new government during the rebel campaign?  5)  What happened to all the remaining characters?  Joanne, Katniss' Mom, Annie, etc.    To Suzanee:  Thank you for such a compelling, gruesome and beautiful trilogy.  Please consider writing a companion story, (not YA) about the other characters and the changes in Panem.  Perhaps, Gale or Katniss and Peeta's children as the narrator.
1416585710|4.0|Readers who are strictly fans of more formulaic genre stuff like Pet Sematary or self-referential, adolescent tripe like the later Dark Tower books should definitely look elsewhere.  Readers wanting a quirky, sad, and creepily atmospheric love story capable of generating sincere emotional interest could do worse than pick this one up.  I won't waste time with a plot summary, since there are about 200 of them in the other reviews here, but I will say this: don't believe the haters.  Like Insomnia, Lisey's Story is a bit of a misfit.  Also like Insomnia, it ranks among King's most interesting novels to date.
B00005V9IJ|5.0|This is a great Tom Hanks movie.  My favorite of course is Forrest Gump, but this comes in a not so distant second place.  It's about a FedEx Delivery man who's plan get's stranded on an island.  Very good movie.
B003JTHXN6|1.0|i got this book in audio form and could not really believe that it had been hyped so much by Kevin Rose.I am starting to think that Rose will hype anyone he is friends with on his podcast or that is a sponsor of his show. The book was dull and too informal, the guy would have benefited from a ghost writer although he prides himself on his informality. His life is just not very interesting! I didn't make it more than a quarter of the way through the book.
B0000CABBW|5.0|Whale Rider is a great movie, well worth watching, it takes you in a magnificent journey with Paikea, a young Maori girl, as she learn the Maori traditional sacred way to become the next clan leader, a role reserved for men.    Paikea is the descendant of the Whale Rider, in their tribe the chief's first born son becomes the next leader, sadly Paikea twin brother, died during his birth. She now try to become the next tribe leader, a traditionally men role within their tribe, her grand-father (Rawiri Paratene), Koro who's currently the tribe leader, and who lives by the ancient ways does not agree. Koro then decide to open a cultural school in order to form the next tribe leader, and asks all the first born sons of the tribe to attend those lessons and forbid Paikea to participate. Hemi (Mana Taumaunu), a boy sympathetic toward Paikea and the most likely candidate to become next tribe leader, is caught teaching Paikea how to use the Taiaha, at this moment Koro starts to think that Paikea might be the reason for the tribe misfortune. Aware of Koro refusal to teach Paikea the old ways her grand-mother (Vicky Haughton) takes upon Paikea's learning of the old ways. Paikea then ask her uncle Riwiki (Grant Roa) to teach her how to perform the Haka, and how to use the Taiaha, a sacred weapon in the Maori culture. Paikea sneaks into the school to learn the sacred chants taught to the boys by Koro, chants that he will use later to call upon the Whale spirit to help his tribe. Seeing no answer from the spirits Paikea then use the chants to call upon the spirits herself. Getting ready to attend Paikea's school play Koro finds many whales on the beach, he is then convince that Paikea is the reason for the tribe misfortune.  Seeing Paikea riding the biggest whale back to the ocean Koro then realize his mistake and acknowledge Paikea as the next tribe leader.    This movie contains many sacred ways from the Maori people that can also be found in many other indigenous cultures around the world. Such as the animal spirit who is often used as a guide is present in this movie as the whale, the initiation that the young boys must go through to become the next leader, the sacred chants used to pass down knowledge from generation to generation, the prayers to their ancestors and the dances present in many indigenous cultures.    Whale Rider directed by Niki Caro is a movie based on Witi Ihimaera book that will take you into a journey with Paikea (Keisha Castle-Hughes) the latest descendant of Paikea, the whale rider, he who rode the whale spiritual guide of their tribe from Hawaiki. Director Niki Caro did a magnificent job with the cast of this movie; we believe and feel Paikea joy, pain and sadness throughout the movie. He also gives us a glimpse look at the Maori sacred ways.
0439023513|4.0|No Spoilers:    I love this series, each book for a different reason. The conclusion of any series is always controversial as it's the summation of all our wants and hopes for the characters we have come to love, and we always want the best for them, a happy ending, which is not always possible or in line with what the author decided for them. In Mockingjay, Collins gives us a realistic and appropriate conclusion. The characters are where I expect them to be for all that they've been through, eventhough I wished for more happiness for them.     Many reviewers have complained about a lackluster Katniss in this installment. Yes, at times she seems to have lost her \\"fire,\\" choosing to retreat in a morphling haze or simply hiding out. However, this seems appropriate as she has been shoved into a role she had no intention of assuming the day she chose to take her sister's place at the games. Katniss is also trying to function in a world where appearance is not always reality and there always seems to be a puppetmaster dictating and orchestrating one's every move. Imagine the haze and confusion you'd naturally feel when even your most sincere actions are manipulated into a piece of government propaganda? The berries. Rue's song. Every move she makes has dire consequences, so inaction sometimes may seem the better choice. Katniss does not disappoint though when it really matters. The fire is still there; she just acts with more discretion, and the decisions she does make in this novel are crucial. I see this as a realistic development in her character. As for the \\"emptiness\\" or \\"dead inside\\" attitude, well, considering all she's been through, Collins has got it right. I would cringe if Katniss's spirit or morale didn't take a few hits or if she emerged emotionally unscathed. How unrealistic to expect the same girl from The Hunger Games at the conclusion of Mockingjay! Same in regards to the supporting characters.    There are also many complaints about the novel being toofocused on the war and technical/strategic aspects of battle and not enough on the love story. Well, in times of war, isn't that what happens? Soldiers put their personal relationships aside to fight for a greater good. It would be a sloppy work if Collins focused primarily on the love triangle and hastily wrapped up a government coup in the background of the story. Katniss is the mockingjay, the face of the campaign, so the war has to be covered, especially since she refused to simply be a mascot. Gale, Katniss, and Peeta have always wanted a world free of the Capitol and the Hunger Games, so it's natural that this would be their primary concern.    My only complaint is the epilogue. It is a bit rushed. Another 30-50 pages would have been welcomed so that it was clearer to readers how Katniss came to her decision and reconciled her love triangle. Much mending needed to occur, and readers don't get to see this, which is unfortunate when you care about the characters so much.    Overall, this series, from beginning to end, is well worth the time and deserving of an emphatic recommendation.
0439023513|3.0|this is an ok book.i mean its a little too predictable.also it has too much romance.if this were a movie it would be a chick flick.im also a bit dissapointed but im not suprised.i read the gregor the overlander series and the end was not very good.very muchy for a twelve year old.still this book is ok.
B002ZG98CS|4.0|All the praise you're hearing about this film is true, so I won't bother restating that.  It's an insanely enjoyable movie.  The only thing that detracted from the otherwise fantastic experience was the casting of Lindsay Lohan.<br /><br />I'll admit that I'm biased against her, but that's only because she's a horrible human being.  Her performance was mediocre at best, her looks cannot compare to the other leading ladies, and most of all, her character was completely pointless as far as the story goes.  I can't understand why Rodriguez included her, and if someone can explain it to me, please do so in the comments.  He has demonstrated several times how great he is at making this type of film.  So it just baffles me as to why he'd purposely subject himself and his crew to working with her, and his audience to watching her.<br /><br />It disappoints me that she will receive a percentage of the money I spent in the theater tonight, and the money I will spend on the Blu-ray when it's released.  However, I definitely do not regret those expenses, because this was an awesome movie.
B003VANOFY|3.0|These headphones are good for 100 dollars, but I wouldn't pay more than that.  I am returning them.  I am pretty picky when it comes to audio.  Don't get me wrong the sound quality and microphone quality of these is pretty good, just not on par for me.  The voice morphing for the microphone is pretty good, the space squirrel and giant are the best ones.  You have to pay like 20 dollars for software that does that.  Anyways I am going to list the pros and cons and my main reason for returning them.    Pros:  -Sound Quality  -Microphone Quality  -G Buttons  -Volume control on headset is fantastic addition  -Wireless  -Great charging system  -Decent Software  -Folds flat for storage  -Range is pretty accurate  -Look pretty good while your wearing them, not huge airplane headphones    Cons:  -Comfort  -Price  -Range isn't as good as some people say, but on par with 40 feet  -Closed-ear headphones    The main reason I am returning them is the comfort.  I have a larger than normal head, and although these aren't terrible, they do fit too snug for me.  The best comfort headphones I've owned were the Razer Barracuda and Sennheiser HD-555.  I know the HD-555 headphones were open-ear which means you can hear things around you and allows air inside.  These headphones are closed-ear and even after like 20 minutes of wearing them I already feel a little sweat from them.  I had a bad feeling about these headphones but I though I would try them out considering all the good reviews I read.  But if your into watching movies and music I recommend the HD-555 headphones.  They are also good for gaming as well.  I consider myself an audiophile now after using the HD-555 headphones.  These are pretty close to them, but the Sennheiser's are much better quality and make you feel like your there.  Anyways, I can't justifying paying this much for headphones that aren't as good as I expected.  If they were 100 dollars, I would probably keep them, but they're not.
1427210497|4.0|Two things drew me to this book -- the promise that it was a great depiction of 21st century suburban life, and all the hype about Jonathan Franzen in general.  Hype can hinder as well as help a book.  Automatically I was going in to the book with a sort of \\"Prove it!\\" mentality.<br /><br />Another reservation I had going in was the early reviews I had seen saying that we would see ourselves in these characters, but we wouldn't like these characters.  I by no means only read \\"happy tales,\\" but I also don't gravitate towards scathing criticism of the reality of our lives.<br /><br />I was pleasantly surprised with the characters and the plotline.  No, these are not heroic type characters, but they are absolutely real.  Yes, I disliked some of the choices that they made, but they were painted with a broad enough brush, that I didn't end up hating the characters completely.<br /><br />And it IS the kind of book  you want to talk about:  Is this what our society is like?  Are you like this?<br /><br />The theme of FREEDOM comes through loud and clear, but in so many ways other than what you might think:<br /><br />*freedom from dysfunctional friendships and families<br />*freedom that leads to entrapment somewhere else<br />*freedom from selfish desires<br />*freedom to indulge selfish desires<br />*freedom from convention<br />*the responsibilities of freedom<br /><br />Because of a satisfying conclusion, which wrapped up these characters' stories, the strong voice of each character, relevant observations of society today, in a story told with honesty and a good amount of humor, I give this a solid 4+ star rating.  I'm glad I read it.<br /><br />AUDIO NOTES:  I actually listened to it.  An audiobook is a good way to tackle a long book.  These CDs were over 19 hours long, but the narrator David LeDoux did an excellent job nuancing each of the characters' voices.  I think that this is one of the best-read single-narrator novels that I've listened to.  Patty's self-deprecating laugh will stay with me for a long time.  I'm glad I experienced the book in this way.book in this way.
0738711500|5.0|Of the several dozen books I have on how to read the tarot, I would have to recommend this one as the best starters book you could get.<br /><br />Josephine makes the cards so very simple without the unhelpful bland symbol descriptions, so you can actually read them in a spread if your intuition isn't up to par just yet. Her card meanings are fairly standard, but she gives you a few interesting slants on many of the cards, and a great method for interpreting the court cards.<br /><br />At the beginning, she explains how to use a tarot deck, at the end she gives you sample spreads, and in the middle she gives a card by card breakdown of its meaning in a spread.<br /><br />Most helpfully, all the way through and in a chapter at the end, she gives you information of card combinations, which most books lack.  How to read the cards next to each other and in runs of three, and surrounded by well aspected or not well aspected cards.<br /><br />She also includes a great comprehensive spread of her own concoction, which, if you master as one of your first spreads, can give accurate and detailed readings that are a step more advanced than the usual celtic cross.
0394806220|5.0|My three-month-old loves this book. She always gets bored halfway through Cat in the Hat, but this one holds her rapt attention. It perhaps requires a bit of a dramatic flair to get through, but that's probably true of all Dr Seuss's books.
0374158460|3.0|Franzen is a talented writer, and by giving this novel three stars I am by no means making an attack upon him.  In fact, it is my opinion that The Corrections is a sublime piece of literature.  Franzen wrote that novel with a perfect combination of humor and pathos, straddling the line between farce and melodrama while only occasionally going astray.    Chip was a character for the ages.  Funny, flawed, and deeply interesting.  Who can forget the scene in which Chip shoplifts $78.40 worth of Wild Norwegian Salmon?  Chip screws up again and again throughout the novel, but he screws up in ways that the reader can understand.  He is a believable and consistent character, rather than being a slave to the novel's narrative/thematic arc.    There are no characters in Freedom that come close to matching Chip's quality.  I'm sitting here a mere four hours after finishing the novel, and I can't recall any scenes that particularly stand out to me.  Make no mistake, when I complain about the characters in Freedom, I do not complain about them being unlikable - although they are indeed unlikable - rather, I complain about them being uninteresting.    Patty hates her family growing up.  She is good at basketball, is therefore a good competitor, therefore enjoys to win.  She is raped at a party in high school.  She has an attraction to the musician Richard.  She marries Walter instead.  She loves Walter but she doesn't.    This is all that we ever learn about Patty, and it's simply not enough.  Not enough to make her into a fleshed out character, let alone to make her into a character deserving of empathy.  And all the other characters are just the same way.  There is no consistency to them, no meat.    The problem is that the characters function only to serve the theme.  And lord, what a clunky theme it is.  There is such a thing as subtly exploring an idea and then there is the other thing - using a sledgehammer.  Franzen has his sledgehammer out for this novel, and he's goingcrazy with it.  The first half of the novel is not so bad in this regard, but at some point around the halfway mark, the word freedom shows up.  From that point on, freedom is mentioned almost twice or thrice a page, often times in the form of a rather simple, child-like rumination by one of the characters.  Franzen's use of the thematic sledgehammer really slogs down this portion of the book.  As does his penchant for inserting similarly unsubtle - and unoriginal - political rants.    Do I really care what Franzen thinks about freedom or politics?  I have yet to see a particularly nuanced argument coming from him on these subjects.  What I have seen - in The Corrections - is his immense ability to tell a story.    And that's what it comes down to here.  He hasn't told his story well.  The characters are boring.  There's very little humor.  There's not much suspense.  It's all themes, themes, themes.  Blah, blah blah.    Bring on the story, Franzen!  Bring on the humor!  Bring on the emotion!  You're capable of more!
B000NOKAFS|1.0|Just bought Showgirls off Amazon.com. This is obviously a foreign dvd.. It's written in both English and Chinese.. The movie itself plays great. Only problem is you can't remove the subtitles. As crazy as it sounds.. It's true! The dvd automatically started playing with the subtitles already on. I tried to turn them off. I clicked on subtitles and the only options it gives is English, Traditional Chinese, and Simplified Chinese.. There is no option to turn the subtitles off! My best advice for anyone wanting to buy this dvd is don't waste your money and go with buying the original version from another seller.. Probably not Amazons fault in all this. The manufacture is to blame.. The movie itself deserves 5 stars. But, I gave it one because of it being defective!:P Hopefully Amazon will get this problem resolved.. :(
0439023513|5.0|I don't know how to explain Mockingjay. I read it on Wednesday and I am still thinking about parts of it. It is one of those books that you will either love a lot or hate it. Luckily I adore this book and found it to be realistic for the environment that they were in. I loved that the characters developed and some of them became better people and others failed. I felt more connected to Katniss then the previous books, because her emotions felt more real to me. The first two-thirds of the book were close how I imagined it, there was action, politics, and war. While the last third was a bit rushed, I did like the ending. Collins creates an amazing finale for a stunning series that I am sure many people will like and others will hate.
7885142450|4.0|Main reason I bought this DVD was the price (along with not feeling like waiting half a year for the Blu-Ray release...) It's an excellent value for the price. The subtitles are not perfect, as previously mentioned it is mainly just obvious tense issues, and there were a few line that seemed awkward, but it didn't really subtract much at all from the experience. The Visual and Audio quality is EXCELLENT on this release, better than Funimation's Evangelion 1.01 DVD release. It is actually very close in quality to Funimation's Evangelion 1.11 Blu-Ray release. I've added 15 pictures which cover the packaging, the menu system, and a few movie screens. If you liked Funimation's Evangelion 1.11 Blu-Ray Release, you will enjoy this Evangelion 2.22 DVD release. Very much worth the extremely low price, and will work very well until the Blu-Ray is finally released.    EDIT: I'll be knocking down the score one star being it's a bootleg. I ended up getting the official Region 3 DVD release for ~$19 and this reviewed release looks to be a direct copy of it. I'd recommend spending a little extra and going with the Region 3 version, or wait for the Blu-Ray. Or you can buy the Region A Blu-Ray with English Dub/Sub for $37... I can wait for Funimation's Blu-Ray release.
0439023483|5.0|I've read other reviews that have described this book as sick and extremely similar to \\"Battle Royale.\\"  One reviewer on Amazon even stated that this book was depressing for her to read in these troubled economic times.  I don't see it that way.  I thought the book was fantastic, showing humans at their ugliest and while these \\"Hunger Games\\" are government run, hell, it could be worse in our own reality!  The main character was fantastic; smart, capable, merciful, compassionate and resourceful.  All qualities I'd admire in anyone.  She feels; she is surviving not for herself but for her family.  I think it flows well throughout the entire book and straight on till the end.  Highly recommend.
0765326353|4.0|The Way of Kings is the first book in a new Brandon Sanderson series entitled The Stormlight Archive. By most accounts (including Sanderson's), the series will be pretty massive:  10 books perhaps, and with Way of Kings clocking in at right about 1000 pages we aren't talking a bunch of novellas. Add in that Sanderson is finishing up Jordan's Wheel of Time series, has a YA series still going, and has mentioned a follow-up novel to Warbreaker, and a reader can figure on some few years before the Stormlight Archive wraps up.  So right away you'll need to decide which fantasy-reader camp you're going to belong to on this one:  the \\"read each book as it comes out and agonize during those long interludes\\" reader or the \\"wait until a few months before the final book is released and start digging in, assuming reviews have been kind and the author hasn't died so the series is being finished by someone else\\" kind of reader. We reviewers, though, don't have the choice of door number two, and thus here we are.    Sanderson has somewhat come to be known as the \\"cool magic system\\" guy, based on his earlier books, which is certainly accurate in that his magical systems are assuredly and yes, coolly, original. But it does him a disservice as a writer I think, as a \\"cool\\" magic system can really only hold up a short story (maybe a long one), not a full-length novel or series of such. To keep your readers with you for that long, you need to be good at two basic components:  character and plot/pacing. Sanderson showed in both The Mistborn trilogy and Warbreaker, and to a lesser extent, Elantris, that he can handle both with ease, and the same holds true in The Way of Kings, even if it does have its flaws (and yes, it does have some new magic systems)    The plot has multiple strands, told mostly by three points-of-view. One strand involves an ongoing war begun six years ago when the Parshendi assassinated the king of Alethkar at a celebration of their recently signed treaty. The war takes place in a huge area known as the Shattered Plains and is being led by the assassinated king's son, aided by his Uncle Dalinar. Dalinar wears Shardplate and wields a Shardsword--rare armor and weaponry that make their bearers nearly invincible. But Dalinar is having strange visions and has begun to wonder about the war he's fought for so long.  Also on the Shattered Plains is Kaladin; the lowest of the low, he is a slave sold to the army as a \\"bridgeman\\"--highly expendable laborers whose bridges allow the knights to cross the many chasms that split the Shattered Plains. Though he endures the war from the opposite end of the spectrum as Dalinar, he shares with Dalinar the slow reshaping of himself into somebody different from the man who first arrived at the Plains. He shares as well a bit of supernatural oddity, not dreams, but his association with a \\"spren,\\" a type of being that normally has little to no intelligence, memory, or long-lived interest in events. Yet somehow one has attached itself to him and appears to be growing ever more self-aware and intelligent.    The second strand of the plot takes place far away and follows a young woman, Shallan, as she desperately tries to apprentice herself to the famed scholar/heretic Jasnah (the current king's sister), who is seeking (for unknown reasons) old texts buried deep in the famed library of Kharbranth. As one might expect of a 1000-page book, there are many, many subplots as well:  possible attempted assassinations on the current king; Shallan's reasons for being so desperate to get near Jasnah; a rival of Dalinar who may be a traitor, brand Dalinar a traitor, or may just be an honest noble fighting for his king and country; what's going on with the assassin who killed the old king; back-story to fill in how Kaladin became a slave, and more.     With two of the major points of view being on the Shattered Plains, with Dalinar and Kaladin, and with another of the interweaving plotlines being Kaladin's back-story, I sometimes felt we spent too much time away from Shallan. Outside of that small sense of imbalance, though, Sanderson juggles the many plots and subplots pretty smoothly:  movement between them was smooth and effortless and pacing within and among the various storylines was sharp, save perhaps for the first few chapters where a lot of names, places, world-facts, and so on get tossed at us and slow the reading a bit.  But the book pretty much sped by, never feeling as long as it actually is, something I've found pretty typical with Sanderson's work. In fact, The Way of Kings felt much shorter than the fantasy novel I finished just prior, despite WoK being 300 pages longer (no coincidence it took me only two days to finish WoK but nearly 10--an eternity for me--to finish the other). Kaladin's back-story and his time as a bridgeman is by far the strongest and most moving part of the plot, while Dalinar's plotline offers up a good amount of action and suspense. Shallan's storyline isn't as strong--mostly because there's less sense of urgency, less danger, and the stakes aren't as high--but it picks up quite a bit in interest in its latter half (not that the first half is uninteresting, just not particularly gripping).    Characterization, also a usual strength for Sanderson, also shines in WoK. Dalinar and Kaladin are especially complex, compelling characters. Shallan less so, but some of that is probably due to the more narrow nature of her situation and the fewer number of pages we spend with her. She does develop and change somewhat, but in smaller and more predictable fashion than the other two. Many of the side characters are also sharply drawn, including a young Advent who debates Jasnah on religion and also courts Shallan; the assassin who killed the old king, the current king's \\"Wit\\" (a character familiar to those who pay attention to the fact that Sanderson's book all utilize the same universe and background story); Dalinar's rival Shardknight, Kaladin'sfather, and several of Kaladin's fellow bridgemen.  The world-building is solid--with 10 long books to work with Sanderson can afford to take his time with the details, so he avoids major info-dumps and chooses to gradually reveal the workings of the world. For instance, regions are subject to fierce \\"highstorms\\" and so life has evolved to deal with them: for instance, there is no soil, only rock, and trees and plants can retract themselves into shells. We see more and more specific examples of this kind of life as we move through the book, as we do with the various types of \\"spren\\":  painspren or fearspren that appear when people are, well, in pain or feeling fear, and so on. We spend a lot of time with the Alethi, who form their ruling class solely from people with light eyes (nobles are known as lighteyes or brighteyes) and learn some things about the Parshendi, who fight them on the Plains (and who are seemingly related in unknown fashion to parshmen--docile, nearly mute servants of the Alethi.  Other nationalities, lands are mentioned to varying degrees; one assumes we'll see more in other books, but the simple mentioning of them (along with their varied cultures, architectures, religions, etc.) gives the worldbuilding a sense of fullness and depth, as does the slow revealing of legend/myth/religion involving 10 Heralds and 10 orders of \\"Radiant\\" knights who fought with shardblades and armor against the Voidbringers, who came 100 times a 100 times to try and drive humanity out.    There are several magic systems in use or alluded to as well as an interesting mix of technology/magic as \\"engineers\\" try to emulate the shardplate and shardswords and other magical items. The major system we see here involves gemstones. It's nowhere near as delineated as the alomancy in Mistborn, but as with the world building, one assumes we'll get more and more detail as the series continues. There is also the use of \\"stormlight\\" which resides in gems and three \\"lashings\\"--which seem to involve manipulation of gravity. The magic is pervasive in the story, but doesn't feel as central as in Sanderson's other works (not that it isn't; it just doesn't feel as significant a part of the actual storytelling) and not quite as concrete. And I do have questions about some of its use with regard to power, but as mentioned, I don't consider these questions flaws so much as TBAs.    Writing style has been perhaps the area where I've most consistently found Sanderson to fall short of those I'd place in the very top echelon of fantasy writers. He is not by any stretch a bad writer; I never find myself pulled out of the story by a clunky line or horrible metaphor/simile and I've never really noticed those annoying tics you find in some authors (though here his focus on clothing--particularly women's dress--became too noticeable and repetitive). And his writing has an ease and naturalness to it that helps speed you along, one of the reasons his books seem shorter than they are.  So not a bad writer (in fact, I believe his writing style was a clear and noticeable improvement over Robert Jordan's when he picked up the Wheel of Time authorship), but I can't call him a memorably good one either. I don't get pulled out by terrible lines, but I also don't find myself responding purely to the language/style either, as I do say with a China Mieville or Neil Gaiman, authors where one revels as much in the language as in the stories. But that's a pretty high bar so I don't fault Sanderson overmuch for failing to reach it, while hoping for some further movement toward it (the kind of movement one can see comparing Warbreaker to Elantris).    One poor comparison between WoK and earlier Sanderson works unfortunately is a drop-off in humor. Mistborn has a good sense of humor woven throughout it and Warbreaker was filled with wonderfully written comedy. Here, though, the humor feels quite forced, mostly centered around Shallan, who prides herself somewhat on her \\"wit\\" thatalas for us readers as she employs it often, isn't really all that funny or clever. Much better is the more camaraderie-type grunt humor found among Kaladin's bridgmen, though it's much more sparse due to their incredibly grim situation.    So, I can't help you with that decision on whether to start The Stormlight Archive with book one or wait until he's almost done, but I can say that The Way of Kings is well worth spending your time on due to its strong characterization and plotting. Shallan's storyline and character are the weakest areas, but take up the least amount of space and are mostly weak only in comparison:  you'll still be interested in what happens there. But mostly you'll care about what happens to many of these characters and find yourself alternately thrilled, moved, or compelled to keep turning pages, especially in the scenes involving Kaladin and the bridgmen, which are especially strongly written. Highly recommended.
B003O85W3A|5.0|This is a great album---don't buy a few songs and think you've got it.  Like Green Day, you need the entire album.  Unlike most new albums, multiple singers, multiple sounds,something new every time you listen.  Almost like an old Beatles album with everybody doing more than expected.  Don't miss this one, it is more than it seems, much more.
B003LXM1RS|5.0|I can't recall that many artists who have created such an amazing time period piece as Scissor Sister just did with Night Work.  A concept album like Donna Summer's \\"I remember yesterday\\" or \\"Four Seasons of Love\\". \\"Night Work\\" A story about a guy or a woman going through life in the early 80s working in the club scene and everything it has to offer like sex, drugs, and of course dancing.  Every song is amazing and builds upon each other.  Everything on here will sound like its from the early 80s, even \\"Any Which Way\\" which has a funky Town and Slyvester \\"Do You Wanna Funk\\" feel, songs that were part of Hi-NRG movement that were popular in gay community after disco was dead. As many reviewers have said this has a 70's feel, it doesn't, it's pure early 80's dance.<br /><br />Most artists are now shooting for the fast sing songy stuff with a Hip Hop jargon sound and Scissor Sister don't and it's very refreshing to see a dance record like this going against the norm.  Pick up this album, this is their best work to date for sure.
0439023513|3.0|I give this a \\"B.\\" I truly loved and enjoyed The Hunger Games and Catching Fire. They are amazing books, but to be honest, this one fell a little flat. I dont leave a lot of reviews but I felt I needed to this time.    I get it, we all get it, the book is about the Games. But I also thought it was really about Katniss and her survivability throughout the Games. And of course, with Katniss, comes Peeta. If Mockingjay wasnt going to be about the two of them as much as it was in the first two books, then why not let one or the other die in one of the first two books? Katniss's wavering over her feelings for Peeta have always felt like a true, genuine struggle for her. But in the third book, she cries and blacks out and vows to kill in the name of Peeta, then he shows up and she pratically dismisses him and could care less. Even after all they went through, she was ready to write him off when his condition wasnt his fault. This detail of the story really threw things off for me.     Like another reviewer said- we get it, its about war and trauma and surviving. But we spent 2 books getting to know Katniss as the ultimate suvivor, and she spends most of the third book drugged beyond conprehension(again, mostly over Peeta) or freaking out and hiding in closets. This \\"broken\\" Katniss is treated like a Pheonix, shes strong-she falls apart-repeat.     *spoiler*  I, agreeing with other reviewers, dont understand the need to kill off Prim or Finnick. Finnick, like Katniss, is a survivor. And yet he too is a weeping mess almost all of the book. I DONT GET IT. Then he dies. Just like that. Like he was some nobody-important-character. Then there is Prims death- I guess using it to divide her from Gale would be one way to do it. But it seemed cruel and needless and removed the reason Katniss even joined the games to begin with. As for the end, it felt...well...it kinda left me feeling empty. Like I went through all of this and ended up with nothing. You get to see that Peeta and Katniss end up together, but the love and the unity is totally missing, and thats a shame. They are two very beautiful characters and their story just ends in this awkward, bland, and wanting way.     I loved this series for the most part, and I really hope the movie turns out awesome and not some D-lister. But I have to admit this last book disappointed, eventhough it was good.
B002ZG98C8|5.0|Do me a favor and look outside your window right now.  See all of those brown people slaughtering your white neighbors?  That can only mean that Machete is now in theaters and Alex Jone's Helter Skelter prediction has come true.  That's right: this film is so damn cool that the trailer alone convinced a right-wing media maniac cursed with the power to constantly (and hysterically) predict things that never ever actually come to pass that racial Armageddon was upon us and that our gardeners and housekeepers were plotting against us all along.  This movie was to be the signal.  Be afraid, my Caucasian friends.  Be very afraid.  Oh, wait.  Sorry.  Turns out it's just a cheesy summer action film and everybody who saw it had a great time.  My bad.<br /><br />Machete began it's life as a spoof trailer presented in between films during the massive box office failure that was Robert Rodriguez/Quentin Tarantino's \\"Grindhouse\\" double-feature.  If you'd told me that the 70's exploitation homage starring Danny Trejo would spawn it's own feature film, I'd have said \\"I wish\\".  Wish granted.  And then some.  While the finished product is probably too slick to be properly considered grindhouse material, it is almost certainly the baddest, bloodiest, sexiest, most hardcore, and most controversial film of the summer.  I hear this this other little star-studded action film homage thing out this summer.  Well, said film is likely to have expended it's popularity a matter of months from now, while Machete looks to be a cult classic shoe-in that will be enjoyed for years to come.  This movie is phenomenally entertaining at every level.<br /><br />Let's start with the cast.  Imagine an action film with Robert DeNiro, Steven Seagal, and Tom Savini.  That is three very different shades of awesome right off the bat.  And those are just the villains.  Topping the incredible cast is man-god Danny Trejo (FINALLY headlining) with Cheech Marin playing his brother, but that is still not all.  Man cannot live on sausage alone so we get Michelle Rodriguez in her hottest role to date and the unconscionably sexy Jessica Alba to boot.  Also Lindsay Lohan, looking much less gaunt and strung out than in recent years and much more like the sweet thing she used to be.  In fact, this is probably the sexiest female cast ever assembled on top of the killer selection of leading men and they are taking full advantage. Yeah, I'm going to rain on some parades and call this the best cast in an action film yet.  Deal.<br /><br />Also in the win column (which is a loooong column) is the tone of the film itself.  Rodriguez is simply the best action director in the business, but he also has one of the best sense of humors out there.  Machete comes off not only as a modern 70's exploitation homage and a BOLD statement against the media-fueled hatred and bigotry that persistently plagues non-white immigrants; it's also very funny.  Whenever the hero is about to get his groove on, the audience is treated a porntastic funk flourish while the rest of the film is peppered with an agreeably seamless combination of hard rock and traditional Mexican music.  Rodriguez scores are always fabulous.  And while the immigration issue is handled with all of the subtlety and nuance of a weedwhacker, the satire and celebration of Mexican culture is sure to raise a lot of smiles in certain communities.  Trejo leading a brigade of gaudy lowriders bumping hydraulics or taking on armed guards with an assortment of gardening tools is just too funny any way you look at it.  Let's not forget that this movie is not aiming to be an intellectual assessment of the current political climate in America (although it does a surprising job of summing it up and some of this stuff is not entirely fiction); it's just a rollicking good action flick deliberately extending it's middle finger to people who are frankly too stupid to even deserve to see a film this fun.  There's always that other movie for those people.<br /><br />Machete is a character that combines everything you love about heroes like Shaft, El Mariachi, Rambo, and Dirty Harry and cranks it up to levels previously unheard of.  He gets the girl.  He gets all the girls.  He kills the bad guys.  All of them too.  And most of all, Machete don't text.  Because texting is for losers.  Want more onscreen sex and violence than the other flicks will give you?  Bam!  It gives you every ridiculous thing you saw in the Grindhouse trailer and much, much more.  I'm talking about intestine-swinging, decapitating, seppuku-tastic, eye-shooting, machine-gun motorcycling, pure goddamn cinematic badness through and through.  All that and harsh political commentary from a director who is not afraid to stick up for the little guy in the biggest possible way.  This is likely the best thing I'll see on the big screen all year.  And it didn't even start a race war.  That's what I call a win-win, baby.character that combines everything you love about heroes like Shaft, El Mariachi, Rambo, and Dirty Harry and cranks it up to levels previously unheard of.

B0000AE7CC|4.0|Rabbit-Proof Fence is moving beyond words. The title refers to an actual 1,500-mile fence separating outback desert from the farmlands of Western Australia. In 1931, three aboriginal girls were taken from their mothers. Gracie, Daisy, and Molly were racially mixed sisters, known as half-castes. The Australian government had a policy that allowed them to forcibly move all half-caste Aboriginal children to special training schools. They belonged to what is referred to as Australia's \\"stolen generations\\". The training school was more like a prison. The girls were forbidden to speak their own language, they had to attend a Christian church, and were taught the ways of the white Australian culture. The three Aboriginal girls fled a state-run native settlement in Western Australia and walked more than twelve hundred miles to their home village. The film was about their three (3) month journey back home as they followed this fence. The girls showed great courage and determination on their journey by constantly staying ahead of the trackers who were hired to return them to the training school. The girls showed bravery and resolve in some scary situations. The film highlighted the negative side of white Australian's who truly believed they were doing justice to the girls by `saving' them from their primitive ways. There were also white Australians who helped the girls on their journey who knew they were fugitives. The girls never lost or forgot their indigenous ways. They believe in the power of nature and the ancestor spirits that nature possesses. A bird on this journey inspired Molly to continue forward. Rabbit-Proof Fence was based on a true story; one that should be told for generations to come. Although it was dark period in a country's history, the film could inspire and encourage people today not to make the same mistakes.
145283668X|4.0|This story is such a part of our culture that so many people \\"know\\" it without reading it.  I did not realize how short this book is, yet this does not take away from its impact.  Yes, this could be a story about split personalities, but it's more than that.  It's a book on morality and what would happen if we gave in to every evil thought we ever had.  The theme is timeless and so this book will remain a classic.  Thanks for presenting the book without the \\"fluff\\" of scholarly introductions that sometimes get in the way of the reader forming their own opinion of what the book means.  I also appreciate the symbolism of the cover.
1416955070|4.0|Ok, so I see that some people hated this series, but I really liked it. Is it perfect? No. Could some things be more consistant and smooth? Sure.     But I like the characters, though Clary, as the lead character, is not my favorite, she seems to not know who she is AT ALL. Which gives me a headache. I mean, self discovery is great and all but she thinks and says one thing and does the opposite. Theres nothing worse than wanting to yell at your main character all the time. The rest of it is entertaining and following up with the second and third book make it worht while. I did struggle at times to care about Clary or Simon, but I seemed to always care for Jace, Isabel, and even that turd, Alec.    Im giving this an \\"A-\\" and thats being generous for not wanting to give it a \\"B\\" because its right in between.
0439023513|4.0|Have to echo the other reviewers' sentiments that the book 1 was the best, book 2 not as good and book 3 is just plodding along, with several nonsensical plot elements.  Still, Collins knows how to spin a good story and I've no regrets about reading the book.  Beginning is weak, middle is weaker still but it gains strength towards the end and ultimately doesn't disappoint all that much.
B00007GZR5|2.0|I bought this movie because I read the back of the box which belonged to my fiance's roommate. The summary got me hooked; I opened the case and it was empty, so I decided to get the movie here off of Amazon. I was really looking forward to watching it. It did have many good points in it, however it was missing the things that really connect the audience to what's happening in the movie. The most emotional part of the movie is when each of the characters loses a loved one, mainly the character played by Robin Williams . This is constructed well, but it comes too soon for the viewers to really have a connection to the loss; you don't learn more about each of the characters until later, after their death.   The characters were also unrelatable. They had likes, dislikes, jobs, wishes that were separated from the audience. They were generally good characters, but they didn't help the audience bond with them, which is a key element in any movie.  Overall, the movie was also really depressing. It had some high points, but those were too whimsical to make up for the low points. I wouldn't recommend it.  Though my fiance was crying at the end, so that's got to make up for something.
B001QITO52|5.0|the first time i heard this cd i love the songs on this cd,anybody who knows pink floyd must be a lover of the band.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Does this author not know that a story can't be any good without  paranormal critters running around trying to mate with gullible tweens?  :)  I for one am glad she doesn't.      The Hunger Games and it's sequels are 3 of the best books I've read in along time.  They truely are addicting and very hard to put down.  It's been a long time since I felt the urge to read 3 books in 4 days but this is what happened with this series.    If you're a fan of books like \\"The Postman\\" or \\"Earth Abides\\", you'll probablly  love this trilogy as well.    V^^^^V
B00275EGWY|1.0|Don't watch this movie.  Don't rent it.  Don't buy it.  Give this movie one star.      This movie is terrible.  It's not worth purchasing, either on DVD, Bluray, video on demand, iTunes, or even on bit torrent.  It's not worth it.  It simply isn't.  I know this isn't much of a review, but it's all I'm offering.  Nothing to see here folks.  Move along.  YOU!  Keep your eyes forward.  Don't look at the train wreck.  It's too Gruesome.  YOU!  Cover those ears.  Don't listen to it.  It's awful.  You should rather go deep in the wilderness and listen to the screeching of hoot owls and bagpipes.  YOU THERE!  Don't hit that button.  You'll never get back the money or time you wasted on this movie.  If you download it you'll just wear a bump in your hardrive.  If you play the DVD it will burn out the laser.  It's awful...    I'm not kidding folks.  It will burn both your screen and your retina.  You'll be seeing terrible blurry images when you close your eyes.  You'll see white ghost like images that will either annoy you or make you cry.  You'll be blind.  Your blood will run blue on the floor and vampires will barf at the prospect of drinking your blood.  You'll experience Rigor Mortis while still alive!  It will be like having lockjaw but you'll be totally aware of your predicament.  Yikes.  You looked.  You'll soon experience searing, burning pain due to your rank disobedience.      You were warned.

B00127RAJY|1.0|i don't care for this work out at all!  i felt jillian michaels was completely half assing the whole thing and was really mean.  i know that she's goign for the whole drill sergeant effect blah blah blah but i don't think it's a very good work out.  i go to the gym 4-5 times a week but was looking for something to do in between.  i feel like i should do this work out 3 more times in a row to feel tired, there isn't even any kind of lower body workout, it's all abs and weights.  jackie warner's power circuit dvd is sooo much better!  it kicks my butt, i wake up in the morning so sore it feels great!  this jillian work out was so blase that i had to do a jackie workout right after to feel anything.  jillian really rubs me the wrong way.
0765326353|5.0|I've been a fan of Brandon's work since his first release. I'd been looking for something of this scope from him(set in his own universe and not the Wheel of Time) for a while and am extremely glad he got around to writing it. There is such a huge amount of world building that was put in to it and you can tell the series will definitely be epic in scope. I'm not going to go in to a whole overview of the book, but I will say that it was wonderful and I wish the next book was coming out sooner. I can tell that the stories started in this book will definitely be able to fill the expected 10 books of this series... and possibly more.
0143039431|5.0|I firstly started this novel as a schoolwork, but when I finished it, I knew that I was living with the Joad family with my heart. The Grapes of Wrath by Steinback depicts the life of Joad family as a microcosm of the immigrant workers during the Depression era, and Steinback ingeniously describes the workers' plights and ensuing 'wraths'. The novel was so impressive toward the end; Steinback imbues great metaphors such as the baby, rising rain, vineyard, and so forth, and he powerfully portrays the scenes, especially the final one. I, as a student fond of reading, have to say that the novel was one of the few living novels that I have read.
B00004CXWR|4.0|\\"Spy Games\\" is  full of danger and demands quick thinking on the part of the stars.  It is a story about CIA operative Nathan Muir (Robert Redford) who is mentoring Tom Bishop (Brad Pitt) on the challenges and uncertainty of spy games.  The games are real and deadly as they travel the world from Vietnam to Berlin to Beirut to China.  They are respectful of each other and although they have their differences, there is a deep moral friendship developed as they spent years working together.  It has not always been smooth, and sometimes there has been resentment and hurt feelings, but they have been through much together and they are soul brothers.<br /><br />Nathan Muir is ready to retire, in fact, it is his last day and he has packed his office belongings.  His superiors want to know information about Tom Bishop and all of a sudden all of Muir's \\"feelers\\" go up.  He learns that Bishop has gone rogue and is trying to rescue his lost love in a Chinese prison.  Bishop was arrested and jailed in Beijing on espionage charges attempting to break in and save his true love.<br /><br />All of a sudden the last 24 hours of Muir's career are full of heart throbbing suspense, sacrifice and fast thinking.<br /><br />The movie is well done, although some of the chase and rescue scenes were far-fetched.
B003EV6DBM|5.0|After David Tennant had more or less made The Doctor his own, how would the new cast and crew carrying the franchise forward?  In a word: brilliantly.<br /><br />Transitions are always tricky to pull off.  Russell T Davis took a big gamble when Tennant took over from Ecclestone - a gamble that was almost too clever. To contrast the new Doctor against Ecclestone's dark, almost manic energy, RTD placed the newly regenerated Doctor into a coma, so that Tennant's doctor slept much of the way through the opening scenes. It was intellectually clever but left many viewers feeling a bit over-teased. So the big question was always: how would Moffat handle his turn at the segue?<br /><br />The answer turned out to be far more satisfying than RTD's approach. The opening scenes move fast and furious, mixing humor with undertones of darkness and throwing in subtle, clever little hints (WHERE did that apple come from...?) to the viewer along the way. My family and I were prepared to hate this new Doctor because the trailers had been so very bad, but the first episode swept us up, carried us along, and by the end of the first fifteen minutes we were totally convinced that Series Five wouldn't be a disappointment after all.  Matt Smith's performance is very good indeed, but the real praise is for the script writing, which is of the very highest order.<br /><br />As the series progresses, Moffatt plays with the viewer's expectations, setting things in a direction where we all think, \\"oh, I know where this is leading\\" and then turning it around 180 degrees to head off in an entirely new direction. The most obvious example of this intentional misleading is with the relationship between The Doctor and Amy. There's probably no viewer on the planet who doesn't have The Doctor and Rose firmly embedded in their consciousness, and for a while it really does look as if we're heading for a reprise. But Moffatt is good, very good. We get the most overtly sexual references ever present in a Doctor Who episode and yet... well, as River Song would say, \\"spoilers...\\" You'll have to see it for yourself.<br /><br />Best of all, Moffatt embraces the apparent contradiction of a very young actor playing a very old man - and carries it off perfectly. Smith is at his very best when he looks out of his too-old eyes embedded in a young and oddly angular face.<br /><br />While there are moments here & there throughout the series where the pace drops a bit, for the most part this is compulsive viewing. It continues the tradition of optimism and kindness that has been a core element of the series almost since the very beginning but it returns to the darkness that was part of Series One with Ecclestone. In my opinion Doctor Who needs this counterpoint of darkness in order to work really well, and it seems Moffatt is able to supply it.<br /><br />All in all this is a great series and we must hope fervently that the cast and crew can keep up - or even improve on - the very high standard they've set as they go forward into the Christmas Special and the Sixth Series.... well, as River Song would say, \\"spoilers...\\" You'll have to see it for yourself.    Best of all, Moffatt embraces the apparent contradiction of a very young actor playing a very old man - and carries it off perfectly.

0439023513|5.0|After turning the last page in Mockingjay I just sat there, going over every chapter, page, paragraph, sentence, word, in my head. The Hunger Games and Catching Fire are two of my all time favorite books and I was terrified that I was going to be disappointed in Mockingjay. Luckily, it was just the opposite. Mockingjay was an intense and amazing conclusion to the trilogy and it left me immensely satisfied.<br /><br />To start off, all of my favorite characters returned and had a chance to really show what they were made of. Not only did Katniss and Peeta have a chance to shine, but also Gale, Finnick, even Prim.<br /><br />The plot was engaging and emotional- I had a hard time putting it down, but at times I just had to. It was so intense and just... wow. Every page was filled with a new plot twist and there was endless fighting, violence, death. Of course it's war, so what do you expect? Suzanne Collins didn't hold anything back. She described everything in vivid detail and the reader isn't spared from imaging anything. The pain and suffering the characters have to endure tugged at my heart, and by the last few chapters I was holding my breathe, needing to know how everything would end.<br /><br />There is still some hope and romance that shines through the fighting and darkness, but do not go into this book expecting to be smiling. I know a lot of people were disappointed with Mockingjay, but I have to say it is one of my all time favorite books and an intense, emotional, and gripping conclusion to the trilogy.<br /><br />I didn't go into too much detail above because I didn't want to spoil anything, but if you've read the first two books in the series and haven't read Mockingjay what are you waiting for? And if you haven't started this series yet- you need to. It was fantastically written and will draw you in from the start- I've already gotten a bunch of people hooked on this series (including my parents).<br /><br />Overall: 5 out of 5 stars
0765326353|4.0|In order for my review of \\"The Way of Kings\\" to be accurate, you first have to understand what I consider to be a five-star book.  In my mind, a five-star book is one that EVERYONE should read, regardless of your personal feelings towards the genre.  I've only read a handful of these kinds of books, and so I'm not too surprised that \\"The Way of Kings\\" didn't rate what I consider five star material.      That said, you should read this book.  The fact that you're reading the reviews means that you are at least mildly interested in epic fantasy.  If you haven't been reading Brandon Sanderson, you've been missing out.  \\"The Way of Kings\\", in particular, sets up a vivid world, and gives us a tantalizing glimpse into the wider universe of Brandon's books (all of his adult fantasy, with the exception of The Wheel of Time, is set in the same universe--think Marvel comics, but awesome).  While it is setting up a ten-volume epic, Sanderson manages to create a fulfilling storyline, leaving enough hooks to continue where he left off.  There's enough left unresolved to keep you interested, but not enough to make the book seem incomplete.
B001FB5634|1.0|The book was a mind blower - horrible to read about, but excellent reading.<br /><br />The movie?  Couldn't see a darn thing!  I HATE movies that MUST be filmed in the dark.<br />Let us see it!!!!!<br /><br />If it hadn't been for the book, I wouldn't have known what the heck it was about!
B000SEGQNS|5.0|If you are stretched for time but still want to avoid the worst mistakes in web-usability then this is the book for your. Steve Krug writes in a highly engaging and useful manner about how to improve your web site, its navigation, colors and organization. The book is short, but still deep enough to give you some feel for the subject, without drowning in academic studies about eye movement or cultural preferences for color choices. A highly recommended book and easily the single most helpful resource on usability I have ever read (be sure to also pick up the authors latest book on usability testing: [[ASIN:0321657292 Rocket Surgery Made Easy]]).

B000LB7G00|5.0|This is a great little navigation device. It does take a little learning but it is very intuitive and can be used in conjunction with your regular mouse. I'm using it for SketchUp but it works in Photoshop too. I'm relatively new to SketchUp so I've yet to learn all the things this toy can do. It definitely moves smoother than a scroll wheel on a mouse. I'd say it's a must to have.<br /><br />Rob
0393075966|3.0|Stiglitz call it the Great Recession. His aim is to give us some advices about the context of the aftermath of the recession in the world economy. The new constitution of our economy and the changes those are unbearable for the growth that lies ahead. He sees a new relationship between the market economy and the regulatory state. It is a mixture with nonmarket and nongovernmental institutions. His tradition is John Maynard Keynes. The core problem of the current crises is the risk taking behaviour in the banking world. Most of the time a CDO/CDS was the better investment than to lend a credit to a small to medium-sized businesses. In the first year after the great downturn the bank bonuses turn back to normal. Nothing had changed in the behaviour of the managers. I think the separation of money based businesses and economic based businesses leads us to the basic of the crises.   He fixes the problem right. It begins with the housing market. Low interest rates and a lax regulation fed the bubble. Mortgages increased and risky products got a triple a rating. The banks and security markets had failed in allocating capital in the highest and productive level. They fed a short term profit run which ends in a disaster. The separation from ownership and control leads to a principle agent problem. The short term focus and the securitization of assets lead to imperfect information in the markets. If you buy these products you can't see the assets that are backed behind it. The externalities from the banking sector spread around the world and comes to an end as the investors wants their money back. The real economy is in the focus. What will take us back to prosperity and global growth? He describes the step that takes us out of the recession. It is a flawed respond to his introduction. He described the past to long. The new allocating measures are to short discussed. Half of the book is about a brief history of the mortgage scam, the banking and incentive problems. We all have seen this in the books of the last two years. There is nothing new on the theme. In the second part of the book he responds to the economic order.  The heart of the Keynesian economics is the government spending programs and the labour market. He focuses on the Bush/Obama spending programs. The short sighted programs are a muddling through. In his view the government had spent to less to stimulate the economy and makes them strong for future growth. His reforming economics describes the change in the economic literature. Some hints are about the role of the state, the change in the leading role of the American economy and the uprising of the Asian economies. I think he had write more about these sections and how Keynesian economics can be applied in the current situation.
0307463745|4.0|I suppose a book shouldn't be judged by its suitability for reading in small chunks on a small screen at random intervals, but I will do it anyway. There is a lot of stating the obvious in the book, but it is done in a straightforward and interesting way.<br /><br />In business, of course, stating the obvious can sometimes be counter intuitive, so I hand it to these guys for taking the time to spell out common sense 21st century business practices in an easily digestible form.
030745455X|4.0|Once again the main character, Salandar, is a victim. But while she's a victim, she has an amazing ability to take charge of her life and pay back anyone who has offended her. In short, she's just a few notches below a superhero.  Not only can she break into almost any computer system around, she's also a math wizard, and a talented chameleon who can become someone else when she's in danger. But her ability to do what is necessary to pay back someone who has hurt or offended her is something most people dream about but are never able to carry off. And Salander does it over and over again.<br /><br />This book is another winner. The only thing missing, which the previous book had, are a few passionate affairs to breathe a little more excitement into the novel. I always like a romantic subplot.<br />[[ASIN:0982410514 Night Glitter]]
B003P2WO5E|4.0|I really enjoyed this book.  The world building - great, the characters - great, the plot - great so far, but we'll see what he does with it.  I can't imagine what he's going to do with 10 books, to be honest, but I have faith.    I liked the main character Kaladin, but his special attributes seemed a bit Deus Ex Machina at times.  Brandon needs to dial back his superlativeness a bit ... or make it less relevant, so the character has staying power.  I want to make sure Kaladin stays around for all(more?) of the books.    Even the cast of secondary characters was strong.  Jasnah/Shallan were interesting, but it took until  nearly the end of the book to understand why the sub-plot mattered, and that (along with the last chunk of the book) really opened up the potentially for the rest of the series, giving the series a good chance to stay strong...    For those who say it takes a while to get into, well ... they're right.  But the commitment is worth it; trust me.

B003MWHVLY|4.0|This time around, Sia leaves behind her talent for writing ballads, and goes for fun, sassy, dance-pop tunes. There is one ballad here, with the rest being upbeat, fun songs. The songs have great melodies and arrangements, and there are some that you will be singing over and over again in your head or out loud. Sia is a great talent, and this album is sure to please not only her fans, but also newcomers. If you don't like this album, you're just plain crazy.

0596805888|5.0|I recently obtained a copy of Jeff Potter's Cooking for Geeks: Real Science, Great Hacks, and Good Food.  This isn't like any other cookbook in your collection.  It combines food science with easy to follow recipes interspersed.  I made the Pizza Dough - No Knead Method this past weekend.  It was the easiest pizza dough recipe I have ever made...and it was delicious, too!  The crust baked up slightly crispy on the outside and chewy on the inside - perfect!  \\"You can mix the ingredients together at breakfast time (for example, before running off to that day job at Initech or wherever) and the dough will be ready by the time you get home.\\"  The Office Space reference in the recipe was priceless.  That is one of my all time favorite movies.   The cookbook is fantastic and reminds me of one of my favorite Food Network shows...Alton Brown's Good Eats.  There are many more recipes that I cannot wait to try.  I'd highly recommend this book for all you self-proclaimed Geeks out there.
B003JR1JV0|4.0|Now I am an 18 year old huge fan, but there are some decent songs, especially stay and my heart beats for love. She tries too hard sometimes to be who she isn't, when she raps and her pronunciation of some words in some songs, but overall she sings well and makes each song her own. But in some songs, it's easy to see she could be a great country singer (which you don't need much talent for anyway, :P). The majority of songs have great melodies, since she worked with John Shanks, and they can serve many purposes (party music, workout, relax, etc.) Overall, a great album that will surely please her fans and fans of good pop music.

B000O8OTNC|5.0|This is perfect for people who don't have the time to sit down and work with a stone to sharpen knives.    I use this on my Leathermans, Swiss Army Knives, and CRKT folders, and it makes them razor sharp in around 5 mins. For the really dull blades, a few swipes with the carbides gets them back into shape, then a few swipes with the ceramics gets the blade razor sharp.     For the price, this is unbeatable. It is also really small, so it is very convenient to bring everywhere
0385732554|5.0|Each age has its own idea of the good life - and of its opposite. Lowry has done an exceptional job with the latter. This owes a lot to [[ASIN:0060850523 Brave New World]], with it peaceful people drugged into passivity, but throws in the abolition of sexuality that others, like [[ASIN:0452284236 1984]], have advanced. (I have to wonder whether this book's loss of color influenced later dystopias, like that in [[ASIN:B00005JLWN Equilibrium]].) Then, Lowry throws in aggressive feel-goodism and praise of mediocre that have become so entrenched in the current education establishment - and a core of hypocrisy and casual brutality that chill even more than overt aggression.<br /><br />The central character is scapegoat-in-training, the child who will become the conscience of the community - the one who feels the horror so that others don't have to. If you want a clearly happy ending, well, you're not going to love it. That's your problem. This book's value lies much deeper.<br /><br />-- wiredweird
B002VPE1WK|4.0|I am a little bit biased because I switched from a Lowepro to this one since I ran out of room for my lenses. This bag serves its purpose to hold my Canon 50D, 3 lenses, and a flash.

B003R7L1CE|5.0|This brief review is really a focus on how well the book works with the Kindle.  I've given if five stars for having a linked table of contents, clear pictures, and a linked index of exercises.  As far as a Kindle book goes, I think formatting which allows easy navigation of the work vital, and \\"You Are Your Own Gym\\" delivers.  If a Kindle owner is considering buying print or Kindle version, I would recommend the Kindle version...for all the reasons one owns a Kindle in the first place.   I don't want to comment too much on what the book offers as far as a training program because I've only just started it.  I bought this book because I'll be away from the gym for the next month and I need a way to stay in shape; I'm hoping that this work will meet this expectation.  I will try and remember to update this review in 35 days with my results.  UPDATE:  I didn't think to return to this review until today and I wanted to report on the effectiveness I experienced while following the program and dietary advice found in this book.  I lost twenty pounds in a little over a month with almost no changes to the program Mark Lauren outlines; I ran a little while following the routine but not much and don't believe it was a major contributor.  As far as the exercises, they are challenging and can help a person become stronger and more flexible.  Some things must be kept in mind - weight loss is almost all diet and gaining strength will ultimately entail a caloric surplus.  This book can take a person, regardless of fitness level, and offer new exercises or routines to help that person achieve their goal; however a beginner or novice to body weight training would benefit the most.  Again, I want to stress that while following the Basic program outlined here in this book I met my weight loss and strength goals for the 35 days I was away from the gym.
B003P2VBIK|4.0|I read the book after having watched the first season of this show (which should not have been canceled). Unlike the TV show, the major characters in the book are all physicists, not FBI agents, but this does not lessen the excitement of the story. The discussion around and description of CERN are very good. Sawyer has a way of incorporating current science into his science fiction that will have the curious reader eager to learn more about whatever subject Sawyer is writing about. For those less interested in science, these parts of the book might drag. The characters were developed very well and the story moved at a quick pace for the most part. However, the story did get bogged down in several places with discussions between the characters about free will, although the more philosophical reader will probably like this. Without giving anything away, in some ways the ending is disappointing, although the book is still worth reading.
B002SSUQFG|1.0|I recently received this Seiko SNK809. The back of the case is inscribed \\"WATER RESISTANT\\". The instruction manual (p. 12) states, 'If \\"WATER RESISTANT\\" is inscribed on the case back, your watch is designed and manufactured to withstand up to 3 bar, such as accidental contact with splashes of water or rain, but is not designed for wearing while swimming or diving.' The next paragraph states, 'If \\"WATER RESISTANT 5 BAR\\" is inscribed on the case back, your watch is designed and manufactured to withstand up to 5 bar and is suitable for wearing while swimming, yachting and taking a shower.' There is no mention of water depth. However, the small tag that is attached by string to the watch band states \\"Water Resist 30M\\".    It's questionable whether this watch should even be listed as water resistant to 30 meters. The manufacturer's instructions included in the box clearly state the watch \\"is not designed for wearing while swimming or diving.\\" I have returned this watch because I require a watch that I can wear while swimming and taking a shower. Amazon needs to remove references of water resistance to 30 or 100 meters.

B00005JLR2|4.0|Whether you've read Stevenson's original [[ASIN:144140841X Treasure Island]] or not, this animated sf version of it should have plenty to offer you.  Jim Hawkins (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) is a far-future slacker who unexpectedly falls heir to a high-tech treasure map when its dying alien owner, Billy Bones (Patrick McGoohan), crash-lands on the dock of his mother's (Laurie Metcalf) inn, warning with his last gasp to \\"beware the cyborg!\\"  When Bones's pursuers attack the place, the Hawkinses' boarder Doctor Doppler (David Hyde-Pierce) manages to get them away, then arranges for a ship to take them in search of what may be the legendary horde of a famous space pirate.  The felinoid Captain Amelia (Emma Thompson) and her faithful mate Mr. Arrow (Roscoe Lee Browne), however, don't realize that the cook they've hired, John Silver (Brian Murray), is the very cyborg Bones was talking about, and has recruited a crew of scoundrels with mutiny in mind.  The greatest attractions of this version of the classic tale are the solar-sail ships, CGI backgrounds, and a cast of alien spacefarers that beats anything seen since the Mos Eisley cantina.  (There are also some scary bits, particularly Scroop (Michael Wincott), one of Silver's band, who looks very spidery and acts even nastier than he looks.)  After your kids have seen it, try reading the book aloud to them (or offering it for them to read on their own if they're old enough to cope with the more mature vocabulary and grammar typical of late-19th-century writing).
0920236162|5.0|The best Munsch books are morality tales with the moral cleverly disguised and/or delivered with a comedic punch.  In this medieval tale turned on its head, a ravenous dragon burns down a castle and kidnaps the prince, leaving the princess behind to come to her betrothed's rescue.  Displaying courage and wits, the Princess- one of many strong and clever female heroes in the Munsch canon- brings the dragon to his exhausted, collapsed knees and saves her imprisoned prince.  It as it this point, when the prince sees who his rescuer is and the condition she is in, that the concluding moral is deftly delivered with a witty repartee from our paper bag hero.<br />  The book is funny, suspenseful, illustrated perfectly by Munsch's decades long partner Michael Martchenko, and stands as one of the best children's books of the last 30 years.

044656740X|1.0|this sums up the book:     1. Don't buy stuff you don't need it's a waste of money, and wasting money makes you poor, and makes the credit card company richer.     2.

Spend all the time you need to increase your financial IQ. You'll make great deals than when you're financially clever and become rich.       This book is good for one thing though, for those who are thinking that taking loans to buy boats and luxurious cars and big houses would make them rich.   It reminds you over and over that buying stuff for yourself and your house can leave you with deep economic issues, and only make you SEEM rich. So you must avoid that. but hey, that's what we see on Oprah or Dr. Phil every day or whatever.     If you need a book to remind you how bad it is to spend money you don't have, buy it.     If you need a book to teach you about finance, please remember, this books only tells you how important it is to know about finance but doesn't really teaches anything.
B000PMLFRA|1.0|Well, here we go again. It looks like Lucas is still refusing to give us the true versions of the original trilogy in an acceptable presentation. His excuse is that restoring the original versions would be \\"too expensive,\\" which is ironic considering that he would make at least ten times the amount he will make by only releasing these butchered versions. Lucas isn't stupid, all he has to do is look at these Amazon reviews to see that 99% of the fanbase are demanding the original versions. The true reason he is refusing is because of ego and vanity. He refuses to admit that his special editions are highly inferior to the originals, and he knows that he would be admitting defeat by releasing the originals as well, because the originals would be the only versions that 99% of people would watch. Other, less egotistical directors don't care which version of their films you prefer which is why movies like Close Encounters, Blade Runner, and Alien give you the option to watch whichever version you want. Sorry, George, but we will never accept these cgi-ridden travesties, and that includes the terrible prequels as well, as the true Star Wars films. Give us what we want, or continue to sell products to the few thousand people who will buy whatever you dump out, and have fun losing money in the process.

Lisbeth has had no contact with Mikael after the successful conclusion of their first investigation together. She has been traveling while he has been working on a new explosive book and article for his magazine Millennium. Soon she is caught up in murder and he has to hunt her down.<br /><br />Thoughts: Again abuse toward women is a prominent theme. This time there is more of Lisbeth's history and an expose of human traffickers in Sweden. It was terribly depressing to read how the system skipped over these vulnerable women and ignored them. In this case though Millennium is getting involved which ties Lisbeth and Blomkvist back together again.<br /><br />In the book, they don't really meet although they communicate through Lisbeth's favorite way (computers!) However they are both trying to puzzle out the same thing. One of my favorite things about this book and the previous is how they both solve the mystery despite the fact that they are coming at it from completely different angles and with different knowledge and biases.<br /><br />I would also classify this more as a mixture of thriller and mystery. Mystery because in thrillers the reader is supposed to know more than characters which was not always the case but definitely still thriller because it was absolutely page-turning. It did take me longer to read (4 days to Tattoo's 2) but that was because I had to work and because it's longer. I don't want to spoil much of the plot<br /><br />I did not like the end, mostly because it ended with a cliffhanger! I would have liked it more if I had the third book with me and could have started it although who knows if it would have picked up right afterward.<br /><br />I was just as bothered by the casual attitude toward sexual relationships in this book and possibly even more so because it felt like there was more in the beginning.<br /><br />Mostly cheers to translator Reg Keeland who had a mammoth task in translating these tomes. One thing I didn't like was, in both books, the usage of variations of \\"You'll have to seduce me.\\" That makes me think a. of The Graduate and b. what awkward phrasing. I don't think it works in American English although perhaps it's okay in Britain.<br /><br />Overall: Another gripping thriller from Larsson that ends on a cliffhanger!<br /><br />Cover: I think I like this cover more with the golden hair shimmering although I don't think Lisbeth's hair is supposed to be that color or length so it may be irrelevant.xual relationships in this book and possibly even more so because it felt like there was more in the beginning.

B002ZG980U|5.0|I admit it - I wanted this movie to be awesome.  As a whole, I have been unimpressed with movies lately, and I saw this as almost a last-gasp effort to be truly impressed with cinema again.  Then, Inception came along.<br /><br />As a film major in college, this was the type of movie that we all wanted (and still want) to achieve someday - a truly fascinating movie that is as much a feast for the eyes as much as it is a puzzle for the mind.  The story revolves around Cobb (excellently articulated by Leonardo DiCaprio), and his team of unusual characters who make a living by extracting the secrets of high-powered people, which they they are usually tasked to do by a competitor.  Until now, they have focused primarily on extracting secrets.  But then, a client has a tall order - can they actually plant an idea into another's mind?  The story unfolds brilliantly from then on, twisting and turning and throwing in loopholes left and right, forcing you to do mental acrobatics.<br /><br />Any review of Inception would be incomplete if it didn't also mention the visuals of the film.  In short, they are nothing less than breathtaking.  For me, I am often drawn out of the moment of a film by wondering \\"how did they do that?\\" or thinking \\"wow, this CGI is horrible.\\"  There was little to no moments for me like that in this movie - I was completely engrossed the entire time, and the computer graphics (what there is of them) blend seamlessly into the rest of the film.<br /><br />While I know that The Dark Knight made a bigger box office draw (thus far), I believe that this will be known as Christopher Nolan's masterpiece.  He truly creates a different world for the viewer.  Plus, if the last five to ten seconds of the film aren't a conversation starter, then I don't know what is.  Highly recommended.
0307474712|4.0|One Day by David Nicholls<br />Vintage Contemporaries, 2009<br />435 pages<br />Contemporary; Romantic<br />4/5 stars<br /><br />Summary: Tracing the relationship of Emma and Dexter over a period of twenty years, checking in on them on July 15 of every year.  Following their various relationships, falling-outs, making-ups, and everything in-between.  A huge hit in England, where it came out last year before crossing the pond to us this year.<br /><br />Thoughts: I had basically only heard raves of this book; then I saw some negative feedback but by then I had already gotten the book so I decided that I would take it with me on a trip where I had ample reading time.  I ended up finishing it while I was waiting at the airport to go home which meant I had nothing to read on the plane :-(<br /><br />I was conflicted about this as it has some of the things I don't like in books: casual sexual relationships, smoking (seriously Europe why do you smoke so much? OK that's really only based on this book and Larsson's books but still), and a lot of drinking.  I also went through periods where I really didn't like the characters.  First I didn't like Dex who's a womanizing alcoholic for much of the book.  I understood how Emma could like him because he had this charm and I totally get it but I don't like it.  In many ways, they're absolutely awful people, which is understandable as we're just getting snapshots of their life and people have bad days.<br /><br />I liked the \\"hook\\"-it worked pretty well and while sometimes there were huge changes in between years, it was not difficult to follow those changes.  Nicholls is a very good writer and created a pretty believable story for these two characters.<br /><br />I hated the end.  Don't want to spoil it but if you know what I generally like in books, you will understand when you read it for yourself.  Also note that it is being turned in to a film starring Anne Hathaway (love her! although why not an English actress-I love Emily Blunt personally) and Jim Sturgess.  My advice is to read the book first so you can tell everyone about it once the film arrives.<br /><br />Overall: An intriguing love story with a lot of things I don't like in books.<br /><br />Cover: I really love that it's kind of like that optical illusion so I think it's quite cool; my friend liked that the title is raised.d the book first so you can tell everyone about it once the film arrives.

B00000IWVS|5.0|One of the most powerful pianists I've ever heard. I have a few other recordings of the Sonata and the polonaise but none of them hold a candle to this one. The recording quality isn't great by todays standards but I think EMI did a pretty good job cleaning it up considering its from 1965. The sound quality won't wow you on a nice stereo system but the performance certainly will. If you have any interest in Chopin, you want this recording.<br /><br />Goes great with a St. Bernardus Abt. 12/Westvleteren 12.

Along the way to figuring these out, Blomkvist meets Lisbeth Salander, a decidedly unusual girl who also happens to be the best private investigator he's ever meet.<br /><br />Thoughts: I didn't know much about this beyond the critical acclaim it's received and the fact that my sister liked it, which is also impressive because she's pretty picky.<br /><br />Plots: There are three main plots: Blomkvist's life after libel, Lisbeth's history, and the Vangers of whom there are many. They tie together well although it takes a while for that to happen. Some of the Vangers had ties to the Nazis which enabled me to learn a bit about Swedish Nazism; I didn't know much about Nazism outside of Germany/Austria so that was really interesting.<br /><br />Characters: I mostly liked Lisbeth, except for her vigilante approach to justice although I understand how she formed that opinion. Blomkvist is a bit of a sorry creature who didn't even fight back in his libel suit. The other characters are pretty interesting and two in particular are really terrifying (let's just say they do/have done awful things to Lisbeth and Harriet).<br /><br />Mystery of Harriet: I was feeling so proud of myself, that I might have come up with some solutions but I was wrong; I think I was trying to be too tricky and instead missed a candidate hiding in plain sight.<br /><br />Length: Despite the length, this book moves really quickly. I did think it was a little long and there were some details that could have been cut out but overall I was impressed with how quickly I could read this tome.<br /><br />Quibbles that bothered me but might not bother you: They smoked...a lot; I find that incredibly disgusting. The very casual attitudes toward sexual relationships (Yeah, puritanical American here!); Some language.<br /><br />You may also have heard that there is a lot of violence toward women, both described in the book and referenced to. I can confirm that that is a big thread throughout the book although I think it's mostly meant to be educative rather than gratuitous. I did however blanch a bit at some scenes because I mostly read and watch lighter fare and am unused to such violence.<br /><br />Overall: Page-turning thriller; Recommended for adults.<br /><br />Cover: I quite like this cover; I'm not actually a fan of the covers that show a girl's back with a dragon tattoo-it's too literal.bothered me but might not bother you: They smoked...a lot; I find that incredibly disgusting.

030726999X|4.0|The Girl Who Kicked the Hornet's Nest by Stieg Larsson<br />Translated Reg Keeland<br />Alfred A. Knopf, 2010<br />Originally published 2007<br />563 pages<br />Thriller; Mystery<br />Third book in Millennium Trilogy<br />4.5/5 stars<br /><br />Summary: Lisbeth Salander is finally found and will be going on trial shortly.  Mikael Blomkvist, a journalist and her loyal friend, is out to clear her name and uncover a scandal that will rock Sweden's government.  These are the two main threads of Larsson's massive tome, the conclusion to the Millennium trilogy.<br /><br />Thoughts: I was super excited to get this because I thought I would have to wait until it was in paperback.  But once my mom started reading the books, she bought the third one.  My sister read it first (very slowly because she wanted to spite me!) and then I got it.  Like the previous books, it had a slowish start but picked up toward the end.  This time the end is centered around Lisbeth's trial, where she is being examined over multiple counts. I won't go too much in detail because I want you to read it for yourself.<br /><br />There is also a good short summary of what the books are about: women who are abused and the men who enable that.  I was frequently brought up short by the awful things done by men toward women, specifically because the abusers were men and the victims were women and how the system which should have protected them looked the other way or actively worked to cover it up.<br /><br />I actually thought this book had a lot less of the content I found distasteful in the first two books: the drinking, swearing, and sexual content all stood out much less.<br /><br />Overall: A good conclusion to the Millennium trilogy.<br /><br />Cover: I do like the silver a lot but the hornets freak me out.
B0024RI72U|5.0|\\"Heresy, I say!\\"....it's what I'm sure some of my fellow Blind Guardian fans may shout after reading my take on \\"Nightfall In Middle Earth\\".  Yes, I gave it 5 stars, but while others may laud it as the \\"definitive\\" Blind Guardian album, this is a case where the parts are greater than the whole, unlike its predecessor, \\"Imaginations From the Other Side\\" (yeah, I know, Forgotten Tales was in between the two, but let's not split hairs.....).  Although credit must be given to the band for taking a bit of a risk with the ultimate nerd-metal gamble of trying to create a full fledged concept album around part of \\"The Silmarillion\\" (essentially a back-story/biblical analogue for J.R.R. Tolkien's Middle Earth), some questionable decisions were made that were only overcome by the band's sheer songwriting and performing talent.    Prior to \\"Nightfall\\", Blind Guardian had been making a steady progression in incorporating huge harmonies and melodies into the bedrock of their original thrash/speed metal roots.  \\"Tales From The Twilight World\\" was their first confident leap into a sound that emphasized melody as much as agression, although, to be fair, songs like \\"Valhalla\\" had flirted with this approach earlier.  \\"Somewhere Far Beyond\\" saw the band shedding the remaining clumsiness in their approach, and delivered an epic experience, albeit not as heavy as it could've been.  As stated above, \\"Imaginations From the Other Side\\" was probably their defining moment, as the band retooled the aggression of their earliest releases to incorporate their newer power metal melodicism.  Perhaps the band felt that it would be fruitless to try to top \\"Imaginations\\" by continuing down that road, but in any case, \\"Nightfall In Middle Earth\\" was certainly not the insane, aggressive Blind Guardian we saw on \\"Imaginations\\".    Instead, the band emphasized vocal and guitar melodies and harmonies, while shunting the rhythm guitar and drums to the background.  The production, while certainly not deprived of \\"metal elements\\", was, shall we say, softer, more spongey, and layered with synthesized orchestration.  The songs were more deliberate and measured in terms of both performance and structure; in fact, they were so much so, that Hansi Kursch relinquished bass duties to \\"perma-session\\" bassist Oliver Holzwarth due to what he saw as a necessary concession to the increasingly complex nature of the band's music (a division of labor that continues to this day).    Perhaps the worst aspect of \\"Nightfall\\" is simply how it functions as an album.  The album is riddled with short interludes, such as spoken word sections and miniscule musical intros, that only serve to disrupt the flow of music.  True, Queensryche's \\"Operation Mindcrime\\" had them, and succeeded as an album, but they were more naturally and elegantly integrated into the album.  In this case, they feel more cringeworthy than not, and I skip them without hesitation.  They may appeal greatly to the Tolkien superfans (and I do enjoy Lord of the Rings myself!), but they simply do not work when they trip up the song-to-song flow.  And the songs are simply just that damn strong enough to stand on their own, without unnecessary expository bits.      While \\"Into the Storm\\" isn't what I'd consider the best opener, songs such as the waltzy \\"Nightfall\\", the powerful mid-tempo \\"Curse of Feanor\\", and the dynamic \\"Time Stands Still (At the Iron Hill)\\" all boast stunning guitar harmonies and massed vocal hooks that other bands would kill to just have a fraction of.  \\"Blood Tears\\" uses a slightly psychadelic approach to create an unbridled sense of isolation.  \\"Mirror Mirror\\" was the obvious choice for a single, and is so over-the-top, ridiculously catchy that it was destined to become a signature show-closer for the band.  My belief that there's probably only 5% of the album that isn't multi-tracked and harmonized up the whazoo seems to be born out by a track such as \\"A Dark Passage\\", where a middle instrumental section manages to channel both Queen and Thin Lizzy via a stupendous cascade of harmonized guitar and syncopated rhythm.  Oh, and let's not forget that song's nod to Eastern European/gypsy influences in the second verse!  It's a shame, then, that this collection of outstanding, lyrically unified individual songs is loaded down with no less than 11 intrusive segue pieces.    So there's my \\"heresy\\"; while this is a great piece of music that no metal fan should miss out on, I feel the \\"album\\" aspect has been hamstrung by overambition in terms of hammering the \\"concept\\" aspect home.  It's a five star album with a bit of a caveat.  So now that we've established that NIME is musically worthwhile in a major way, what does the remastered version bring to the table, as opposed to the original 1998 release?  In terms of actual sound quality, the difference is there, but is more subtle than, say, the remastered version of \\"Battalions of Fear\\".  The bottom end is more solid, there's some more separation and clarity present for background instrumentation, and both the bass and rhythm guitar seem to have more bite and presence.      The other reason to own the remastered version is the inclusion of \\"Harvest of Sorrow\\", a gentle, beautiful ballad that's become a mainstay of the band's performances.  Previously, the English version was only available on the single \\"And Then There Was Silence\\", even though most of the basic track had been completed during the \\"Nightfall\\" sessions.  A delicate and quiet, yet sweeping, song of tragic romance (also drawn from the Silmarillion), it is fittingly included here as the last track, the calm after the storm, if you will.  Though it may seem I've dwelt inordinately on the negative aspects of the album, it's only because they stand out in contrast to the memorable and classic music that is on display here, and which I highly recommend to the listener.

Minor spoilers in thoughts (generalities, no specifics; ex. I would say there were a lot of deaths in HP7 but I wouldn't write their names).<br /><br />Summary: The highly anticipated conclusion to Suzanne Collins's Hunger Games trilogy.  Katniss has twice survived the Hunger Games and is now in the hidden District 13 where she must decide if she'll be the mockingjay, the figurehead of revolution against the Capitol.  More violent than its predecessors (yes, seriously!), this book will put you through the wringer.<br /><br />Thoughts: Well, Collins is definitely in the Rowling camp when it comes to who and how many of your favorite characters will die (in comparison to the Meyer camp where it is my understanding that nobody had to sacrifice anything and it was very anticlimactic; note: I haven't read it because I don't hate myself but that's what I've heard).  The consequence is that the characters who do survive along with the reader end up emotionally devastated (well, at least I did).  I didn't cry because I was speeding through but when I reread it, I think I will.<br /><br />It is also very violent because there's a full on revolution/war going on.  Inevitably there are survivors and there are the dead.  And of course those who die are either already beloved characters or have enough of a presence that we miss them.  There are also some secrets about the early days of Panem revealed and very few authority figures we can trust.  The other books were pushing the YA label but I would definitely say this is older YA if not basically an adult book.<br /><br />Teams: Now I'm not going to say if she picks anyone but the reason I'm listing for being on each team is the justification for why she chooses that option.

B000059T1V|5.0|If you're blues fan, this is a no-brainer; one of the best blues singers of all times, caught live, at peak of his powers, well recorded, in great company (Otis Spann, James Cotton...).<br />And yes, he mostly sings and lets the playing to others;<br />there's also an Otis Spann vocal on the Farewell Newport Blues.<br /><br />Energetic, rough but very tasty (although some would say macho) blues of Muddy in Newport will haunt you if you're not familiar with the artist; if you are, this is at the same time a fine performance and a best of album.<br />Also, I believe the rock fans might like it too (and I'm primarily a jazz fan and I also love the blues).<br /><br />\\"Got my mojo workin'\\", sings Muddy, \\"but it don't work on you\\"... Well, it worked on me just fine!
0375842209|3.0|The Book Thief by Markus Zusak<br />Alfred A. Knopf, 2005<br />550 pages<br />YA; Historical<br />3.5/5 stars<br /><br />Summary: (from goodreads)<br />  \\"It's just a small story really, about among other things: a girl, some words, an accordionist, some fanatical Germans, a Jewish fist-fighter, and quite a lot of thievery. . . Set during World War II in Germany, Markus Zusak's groundbreaking new novel is the story of Liesel Meminger, a foster girl living outside of Munich. Liesel scratches out a meager existence for herself by stealing when she encounters something she can't resist-books. With the help of her accordion-playing foster father, she learns to read and shares her stolen books with her neighbors during bombing raids as well as with the Jewish man hidden in her basement before he is marched to Dachau.  This is an unforgettable story about the ability of books to feed the soul. \\"<br /><br />Thoughts: I saw many rave reviews of this before I started reading it so I had high hopes.  Alas I must be an exception for while I can see the strengths of it, it didn't work for me.<br /><br />I liked the idea of Death as narrator but Zusack's Death isn't as good as Terry Pratchett's Death.  I liked the idea of a young girl in Nazi Germany.  Despite the popularity of WWII in film and fiction, I still feel as if there isn't as much in YA (in general I feel like there isn't much historical fiction in YA at all).  Another problem was that despite the little moments in the book, the overwhelming feeling I got from it was depression especially as Hitler and the Holocaust are referenced frequently.  I know the Holocaust was an awful event and I do not want anything of that kind to ever happen again but I personally had trouble handling that aspect. I also didn't like the use of German, followed by a rough translation of what was said-I found it annoying, perhaps because I have studied German and didn't always need the translation so it was like having something repeated to me.<br /><br />My favorite part was the descriptions of books and the joyful experience of reading.  Liesel certainly needed some good in her life and I think book bloggers will appreciate those passages.  The ending did make me cry.  The death all around was too much and practically everyone dies.<br /><br />Overall: While I recognize this as a book that is kind of book that wins awards, I didn't particularly like it.<br /><br />Cover: The dominoes are a good choice for the cover.ns of books and the joyful experience of reading.

B00008OLIO|4.0|None of that nonsense here! Which is probably why this album of lets face it, not exactly uniformly brilliant 80's hard rock/hair metal works such a treat. You are only this young once. Only this dishevelled once. Only capable of the brilliance born of utter self conviction mixed with a hearty slug of ignorance (and arrogance) once. Luckily for us Motley Crue just happened to be passing by a studio at that point of their lives and left us this debut. Now to tell the truth I kinda figured Dr Feelgood was the better album in terms of welding a tiny amount of maturity and arrangement to the whole Crue ethos but it's hard to hear tunes like the title track, Live Wire and Public Enemy #1 peel outta your speakers and not crack a grin from ear to ear. Such is the punk ethic infused bent of these tunes your gut and your fists just clench in celebration.<br /><br />The songs on this album - one that became somewhat of a blueprint for how bands wanted to act, if not sound, for much of the rest of the decade are ultimately simple cartoonish numbers designed to be played in bars and clubs at high volume. They pretty much all scurry by and leave the listener hungry for more, this is an album that doesn't outstay it's welcome and while some of the numbers come off as somewhat twee the heads down nature of the hard rock on offer along with the passion with which it's all played masks these weaker tunes to an extent.<br /><br />Of course the Crue went on to sell a gazillion copies of their catalogue and despite the improvements in production, arrangement and an ever expanding chutzpah there is part of me that probably rates this and Shout At The Devil as albums that cannot really be topped for youthful zest.<br /><br />As to this enhanced edition, it's been so long since I listened to the original version that I can't put my finger on exactly how much better this thing sounds with an updated knob job. But what I do like is how the original well paced album isn't bogged down by the addition of extra tracks. They very much blend in with the original and the live version of Merry Go Round does too, after all the album was initially done in three days so the difference between studio and live shouldn't be expected to be a yawning chasm! The inclusion of the Live Wire video was a nice touch though it's available on later VHS/DVD releases..

0691142165|5.0|This book is one of the most complete reviews of financial crises over the last 800 years that I have seen.    After the Crash of 2008, some of the Lessons Learned from past crises would seem to apply today.  For example, how do countries stay out of country related financial crises?    The secret to keeping your country out of trouble is to first live below your means, meaning running a surplus each year. Second is to borrow as little as possible and to fund the debt with maturities over 10 years. Third is to have no hidden off-the-balance sheet guaranties.    How to get your country into trouble is to run a deficit every year, borrow short term to fund the debt, and have a lot of hidden off-the-balance sheet guaranties.    The authors divide past financial crises into many categories including inflation, currency crashes, debasement, serial default, this time is different, banking crises, and external/domestic defaults.    Some of the summary statistics from past financial crises include:    Average house price decline of 36% with 2008 sub-prime being 30% and 1929 of 12%.    Average time for home prices to recover of 6 years.    Average stock market decline of 56% with 3.4 years to recover.    Unemployment usually rises by an average of 7%. In the U.S., before 2008 was 4% and it is now at 10%.  The 1929 Great Depression increase was 20% over the base rate.    Average GDP declines of 9.3% and peak to trough of 1.9 years.    The authors point out that bubbles are much more dangerous when they are fueled by debt (2008 Sub-prime crises) than not funded by debt (2000 Tech Wreck).    There has been 5 big bank crises since 1945 plus the 2008 Sub-Prime fiasco.  This means a major banking crisis every 11 years (6 crises in 65 years). The once every 11 year banking crisis is the same order of magnitude as stock market crashes in the U.S. with 8 Bear markets since 1945 or once every 8 years (8 Bears in 65 years).    The authors found that a banking crisis is the worst kind of crash. They found that real housing price bubbles were the best predictors of banking crises.  Annual deficits and stock markets were not good predictors of banking crises because they give too many false alarms.    One astounding finding to me was that government debt usually almost doubles (86% increase) after a banking crisis. It seems like the U.S. is on track to exceed the historical average in this category.    Why have banks managed to create their own crisis about once every 11 years? The authors theorize it is because of the inherently unstable design of banks.     Fractional reserve banking is based upon taking in deposits (that can be redeemed in a minutes notice) and then lending the money long term (where it is illiquid and can not be redeemed quickly).  As soon as the depositors lose confidence in the bank, they create a run on the bank. Since the banks keep very little cash on hand, and they can't liquidate the loans quickly.........they become insolvent and close their doors.    Listening to Bernanke testify at the Financial Crisis Commission, his biggest worry back in September 2008 was a national run on all banks by the depositors.  This came very close to occurring when a money market mutual fund \\"broke the buck\\" on its money market accounts. If all investors had withdrawn their money from money market mutual fund accounts, the system would have shut down.    In summary, this book opens up your eyes to how common banking failures are with an average crisis period of once every 11 years.  As an investor who purchased some bank stocks in 2006 and watched them start to decline in 2008, I would recommend never buying bank stocks.    With an average U.S. stock market Bear market occurring on average every 8 years and a banking crisis every 11 years, I would suggest a low-cost broadly diversified portfolio in global investments.    I guess the recent bank reform law included a provision for the biggest banks to provide a \\"living will\\" telling how theycould be broken apart and easily sold when they fail.  It will be interesting to see if this helps the \\"too big to fail problem\\" the next time the banks screw up.    For students of financial markets, this book belongs on your bookshelf.
B001D84NKQ|4.0|Soundtracks have a distinct advantage in that if you buy them you probably already have good vibes towards the tunes already. And as the album unfolds before your ears you'll get bombarded with audio signatures that remind you of a movie that you liked - otherwise it's pretty certain you wouldn't be buying the disc in the first place. And given that, the release doesn't really have to hold together as an entity overmuch and as in the case of this CD, it can be all over the place in terms of genre and feel and still work.<br /><br />This soundtrack to the Guy Ritchie flick is quite definitely all over the place in terms of wattage enclosed. We get prototype pop punkers The Clash, we get Lou Reed, Wanda Jackson and rock bands like 22-20's, The Scientists, The Subways and waaaaay left of field stuff like the Russian language tune Dopilsya by Ex-Sektor Gaza. While much of the music here may not appeal to the average punter who digs Guy Ritchie films the ability to pick up a range of cool tunes that will bring back pleasant memories in one fell swoop is a handy thing.<br /><br />Of course I have to mention the snippets of movie dialogue as per the soundtrack to Good Morning Vietnam and others. They do help to break up the album and provide another way of anchoring this album in memories of the film from whence it came.<br /><br />If you loved this film and want to find a bunch of these numbers all in one place you could do a lot worse than slot this into your shopping cart.

0765326353|5.0|This book is simply amazing with an incredibly detailed world and excellent character development and I felt compelled to write a review so others could get excited and take the plunge into this 1000 page book 1 of 10 adventure!  Here's why I couldn't put this book down:<br /><br />I've always enjoyed reading Brandon Sanderson's books because he does such a wonderful job of creating believable and interesting characters filled with emotion that connect me as a reader to their stories.  Although this book has several character arcs going on at the same time, they are each interesting and I never felt upset about leaving one arc and going to the other arc.  Also the pacing between arcs kept me excited and I never felt bored with any of the stories.  Each also had a bit of mystery and intrigue and not all the arcs get completely resolved at the end, leaving a few mysteries for the next book as a tie-in.  I also thought it really cool that the end of the book brought closure to the prelude and opened up a whole 'Oh Dear' wellspring of thought for the next book.<br /><br />To accompany character development, Brandon has also created a very rich and diverse magic system, multiple religions, ancient artifacts, and current mechanical-magical inventions to add to the mix.  Couple this with murder-mystery intrigue, political maneuvering, fighting, philosophy, romance, laughing, crying, and unexpected twists and you get everything you could possibly want in a fantasy epic.<br /><br />The other incredible feature about a Brandon Sanderson book is the care he takes to develop the world and this book tops his others.  I've read other books that had incredible storms or made up creatures but this is the first one I've ever read that had such widespread flora and fauna adapted to the world in such an integral way.  The world feels very oceanic-based but without the water - most animals are crustaceans and tree leaves and grass act like a sea anemone and withdraws when endangered.I got great enjoyment during one of the interludes where a woman visiting a rare Earth-like region where the grass and trees didn't react compares this to a \\"man who was born without all his brains, one who didn't know when to protect himself, but instead just stared at the wall drooling.\\"  The Shattered Plains is a also a very interesting geographical feature which provides a unique twist as arrmies struggle to get across numerous chasms to engage the enemy quickly.<br /><br />The artwork adds a very special element to the book and really helps bring this world to life.  Drawings of plants, animals, buildings, and unique geographical features allows the reader a detailed glimpse into the author's visions and really adds to the enjoyment of this world.  I hope we get more art in future books!  I'd actually recommend buying the hard back just for the art.<br /><br />This is a really great beginning for an epic saga.  I'm definitely excited about seeing the rest of the series and truly hope Brandon Sanderson can keep the momentum and excitement going throughout (and the art!).
B0000024Z7|5.0|Ever since this album was released - way back in the mid 70's - I've been hooked on it's twist from traditional \\"Santana latin rock-and-roll\\" to a new version of Carlos Santana's style that displaced itself with a beautiful new form of latin flavored fusion of rock-and-roll and jazz.<br /><br />So excellent.  Refreshing.  A different taste of Santana!  I love to listen to this album while at the day job, entertaining friends, or driving on the road.  It's perfect anywhere.  Timeless.  Perfect for all musical tastes.  Delicious instrumentals.  Your money is very well spent here - in my opinion.
B002RSDW80|5.0|I'm gonna make a confession right up front--I LOVE anything that Meryl Streep is in because she is one of the most underrated actresses in cinematic history. Her genius is an uncanny ability to dive so completely into a character that you can't help but see the person she's playing rather than the actress.  That's the sign of an incredibly talented person and Streep hits on all cylinders in JULIE & JULIA like she did in THE DEVIL WEARS PRADA.<br /><br />For those of us who didn't know how Julia Child became such a world-renowned household name, this film gives you the back story about how her husband moving from city to city as a disgruntled government employee gave her time to pursue things that interested her.  While she tried her hand at a variety of subjects while living in Paris, France, she eventually came to the realization that cooking was her real passion and began pursuing it.  From high-level training in a prestigious cooking school to being approached by a couple of flaky potential cookbook authors to collaborate on an English cookbook with French recipes, Julia constantly went after the dream--bringing French cooking to Americans who didn't have servants to cook for them.  Thus was borne what would become one of the most significant culinary figures of our time whose impact is still felt today.<br /><br />JULIE & JULIA simultaneously runs the story of a 9/11 government group employee named Julie who got inspired to do something with her life in 2002 when she set her sights on cooking her way through all of Julia Child's 500+ recipes in the span of one year--and blogging about it!

0143118420|4.0|This book not only keeps you entertained throughout but is very thought provoking as well.  She writes with a quick wit and sense of humor that, although the subject matter is sometimes rather deep and serious, you can't help but chuckle all the way through it.  It leaves you thinking about what you've read long after you've closed the book for that day.  I found myself thinking, \\"I'll just finish this chapter and then go do ............\\" whatever, but before I knew it, I'd be in the middle of the next chapter and completely forgot to close the book and go \\"do whatever\\"!  Well worth the read!  Can't wait to see if the movie lives up to the book.<br />[[ASIN:0143118420 Eat, Pray, Love: One Woman's Search for Everything Across Italy, India and Indonesia]]
B0036EH3X4|5.0|I had not seen any of season six until I recieved the DVD collection in the mail.  It was an amazing journey that left me saddened and thoughtful at the end.  Very well thought out with an ending that moves you.
B000002U88|4.0|This CD is not readily available in stores.  I'm glad I was able to find it through Amazon.  The service and speed that I go the CD was excellent.
B003UYUR10|4.0|The movie is your typical blockbuster movie which relies a lot on action and comedy, but at least it does that really well. The story and effects are good but dont expect it to very something like the games.<br /><br />Its still a good movie which i recommend getting, perhaps when it lowers its price below the $20.
B002SR2PKG|5.0|I first read \\"It\\" when i was 14.  Since then i have read it more times than i can count.  From the first page, the reader is immersed in a fear induced trance, that doesn't end until the book concludes.  A very long book, with very few 'slow' areas, but be warned, i am now 33, and since my mid teens, i've been petrified by clowns.  This is a prime example of why Stephen King is soo highly regarded.  The reader can identify in the heros all of their own shoertcomings, and all of their weaknesses.  The charcters' fear is transferred to the reader.  If you love being scared, this is a must have.
0439023513|4.0|One month after Quarter Quell and Katniss is still healing.  Katniss returns to the ashes of her home District 12 to see the devastation with her own eyes.  Katniss is still trying to put the pieces and players together to figure out what's true and what's not.  She feels guilty for the deaths of District 12 for her actions in the Quarter Quell ~ upsetting the Capitol to make them do this to her home district.    In Katniss's state of mind and distress over what has happened with the games she can't decide if she wants to join up with the Rebels and be the image they need her to be... the Mockingjay, to give hope to the other districts while fighting.  Yet the help with clothes, speeches and such all sound just like the position Katniss played before each game.    This book starts off slowly with learning who and how the rescued ones are.  You learn there are great worries for the ones who were captured by the Capitol, and you see how devastating it is to the ones who are alive and... well alive.  Here in District 13 you start to see there are rumors about the place and you wonder slightly on it while learning interesting details of the place, but the people are safe and accepted here.      I was aware from the previous two books that President Snow and the games really affected these kids' minds, but it really shows in this conclusion as to how badly it really was/is.  The clouded view and instability of Katniss from the previous and even current happenings really comes into focus here.  This is also what makes this book so heart wrenching for me.  Suzanne definitely does NOT take the easy road for her characters.  She is very bold in taking this great stand with them, which makes them that much more real to me.    I was wanting to see more of the government and the views of what might have been \\"wrong,\\" \\"right,\\" or where they \\"went from here\\".  But again, these books are from Katniss's view so we are a little short on these explanations.  These books are of Katniss as she grows in the role here.  You do get your conclusion to the story.  But the idea implanted from this world and the reaction of these characters keeps you thinking.    As much as I loved the book and was drawn into these characters once more, I felt left wanting more in the end.  This can be a good thing and a bad thing.  Maybe the frantic pacing in parts of the book once it got rolling and then slower in others might be why.  I'm not sure.  Maybe the trauma periods for Katniss, when she is sedated, is what I felt as I'm missing things, I wasn't sure I was getting all the information or even the right information.  But I was seeing Katniss's view on everything to understand her even more.  It might be that I don't really get my closure with what happens in the government and politics.  But the book left a huge impact on me.  The thought to do what is right and needed in the bigger picture.    Is this the perfect ending to the trilogy?  I don't know.  I do know I was drawn right to the characters and the destructive world they live in.  Drawn so much I was heart broken in the end.  But there is a short ray of hope given after it all.  For me this book is about more than how Katniss chooses to be with, it is about what you choose in life to fight for and what you will do for it, but keep your eyes and ears open to not be tricked to do for others.
0439023513|1.0|The first book in the series was great.  The second was pretty good.  This one was rotten.    Suzanne Collins' considerable writing talent was wasted in this book.  She did a great job of helping the reader explore gore, paranoia, sadness, manipulation, violence and many other negative experiences that cause mental instability.  Who wants to become intimately familiar with so many depressing topics?  Not me.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|i will repeat myself SPOILER ALERT!         i am a young hunger games fan and the book at times was a bit difficult to read but i am a happy with the ending and the epilouge. *spoiler alet* i am a peeta fan so the ending for me was the cherry on top!  At times I feel that some parts like prim and finnick dying were a bit not right. I have loved Prim since the first book and for her to die created a uneasy feel for me, same for Finnick. this was a roller coaster of a book and i will read this series for many years to come! i absoluetly loved this book!
0618680004|5.0|Buy it, buy it, buy it, buy it, buy it.    \\"The God Delusion\\" has it all:  history, science and blistering rhetoric (in the real sense of the term).  Some complain that this book is a bit hard to read in places, but Dawkins writes for an educated audience.  Others have chided Dawkins for being too scathing.  All I can say about this accusation is that those reviewers must never have tried to live openly on this planet as an atheist, or they'd know precisely where he's coming from.    I recommend this book without reservation.
B0021L8V1Q|3.0|The picture aspect of 2:35:1 is too narrow for acceptable viewing on a normal tv set , particularly if you have below average eyesight. If you zoom it in you miss too much of the peripheral action. It would be great if they could release 2 versions, one in 2.35:1 for those who like this format and one in 1.77:1 or 1.85:1 for those who prefer that format.
B000BYCAJE|5.0|This is an album that should be in everyone's collection. The music, while it has some references to the time period (late nineteen sixties), is truly timeless. Crosby, Stills, & Nash was the perfect storm of musical collaboration. Three singer/ song writers from three different bands coming together at the most opportune time. Everything aligned to make this happen at Mama Cass Elliott's house. Their history is well documented. The music speaks for itself.
B00005B36H|5.0|There's 99.99% of rock bands that all sound the same, and then there's Tool.  They don't just play rock music, they play rock operas.  The cryptic yet meaningful lyrics and the layered music make them the greatest band of all time.  No others come close.  You don't just listen to Tool, you experience Tool.
B003ZSIS6C|5.0|The previous reviewers have done great job summarizing the contents, and I'd simply like to add that one of the key messages of this book is \\"Don't waste your precious time for doing something you don't love or enjoy\\". He values his time - \\"4,440 minutes to fill with things you like to do every week\\" (from Chapter 9: Radical Exclusion and the Quest for Abundance\\"). Naturally, he doesn't want to waste your time either, if this book is not for you. On page 7, he has a list of characteristics he wants his readers to have, which I recite here:    1.You Must Be Open to New Ideas  2.You Must Be Dissatisfied with Status Quo  3.You Must Be Willing to Take Personal Responsibility  4.You Must Be Willing to Work Hard    If you read these four points and think \\"I am not that person\\", then this book probably isn't for you. For the rest of us, it's a must read. I am a mother of two young children, have my own business and plan to relocate the entire family within a year so our kids can have the experience of growing up in a culture so different from the United States. I encounter lots of questions or sometimes objections when I tell others about my goal, such as \\"What about your husband's job?\\" \\"Why would you leave this (wonderful/comfortable) life here in the U.S.?\\" \\"Isn't it risky?\\" \\"Aren't you worried?\\" At times I do think that I might be \\"crazy\\" for wanting this, but reading his book gave me a renewed sense of commitment towards my goal. Lastly, it's an enjoyable read as his writing style is very personal, yet direct. He doesn't sugar-code the truth but he also backs up the truth with his own experience and examples. If you have read this review this far, I highly recommend you give it a try.
B000003TA4|5.0|There are 2 bands who in my eyes can do no wrong.  The first is Tool, and the second is Nirvana.  Neither of these bands have made a bad or uninspired song.  In Nirvana's case, they changed rock music forever.  They spit in the faces of the '80s hair and makeup bands that didn't make music with a purpose, but rather to make money.  Nirvana can be called Grunge, but they're so much more than that, they are passion rock.  Just watch a video of a live performance by Nirvana or simply listen to Kurt's passionate screams.  People can complain about Kurt's vocals all they want, but it's his imperfections as a singer that add to the flavor of the band as a whole.  Love it love it love it.
B0036EH3XE|2.0|I really enjoyed the first few seasons of Lost but then had gotten away from it.  I was excited to get season 6 as a gift.  They didn't even try. I would have rather gotten an explanation that I didn't like, rather than them not try at all. Instead we got a incredibly boring season that spun its wheels until the finale, where through some fancy misdirection from the writers, we were told it was always about love and the characters and all that nonsense you can find on any other average tv drama. How silly of us fans to even think it was about mysteries and dialoge and clues? I can't imagine recommending this dvd. It would be painful to rewatch this season I would just like to forget. I loved seasons one and two. . I cut them a lot of slack because I always assumed the story was going somewhere in the end. Felt like it had to be a masterpiece in the making with all the plot components at work. The writers must have a grand plan. The sixth season merely reveals that the whole series was just a bunch of mysteries for mystery sake and they never had a clue what they were doing as writers. The season was really disappointing, they must of needed new writing talent.
B001AQR3IU|5.0|Picture Princess Bride ala Neil Gaiman. This guy has a twisted, original and highly entertaining style. I'd love to peek into this guy's dreamscape.  Probably a mix of Lovecraft and Disney.<br /><br />This movie is just plain cool. And fun. DeNiro as a swishbuckling  (yes, swish) sky pirate, Pfeiffer was fun and evil-sexy, the sfx were great.<br /><br />Like adventure?  SfiFi/fantasy? Hey, it's even a couples movie.
B000G1ALRK|5.0|If you know where Eric Church got his start, you'll be amazed at how far he's come so far.  A great mix that won't bore you in the least.  Listen on.
B001R0KH3M|2.0|Lots of other great reviews on the content and song selection.  But if you are a fan of great sound and concert videos, think twice before purchasing or consider a rental.  The audio is highly highly compressed and just doesn't sound that great. I give the show 4 stars and the audio, 0 stars.  Will make your super duper home theater sound like TV speakers.
0439023513|5.0|MockingJay was exactly what it needed to be. The Hunger Games was never about some fantasy world where the characters have a supernatural grace that grants a happy ending. It is dark, gritty, real, and I for one would have been very disappointed by \\"Happily Ever After\\". That was never in the cards for Katniss, Peeta, Gale or anyone in the districts for that matter. It was always about self sacrifice. Not because of  some great nobility but because at the time it seemed like the best chance at survival. Not just physically but mentally.<br /><br />I see some of the negative reviews and I wonder if the negativity is based on the quality of the series or just the fact that you didn't get your fairytale ending. If you look past the personal tragedy the fairytale ending is in fact there. Generation after Penam generation will reep the benefit of it even if the ones who made the sacrifice don't get to enjoy it. Isn't that what self sacrifice is all about? This series is outstanding for YA because it teaches us that all the wonderful things we have in the capitol are not without sacrifice. And maybe, just maybe some will learn to appreciate the sacrifices of so many before us and so many who suffer now so we can have our capitalistic lifestyle.<br /><br />Just saying...
B000BQ4N74|1.0|I purchased the 2004 limited edition remaster from 'Hip-O Select' expecting it to be superior to the previous CD release I own. However I was stunned by the DROP in audio fidelity when I popped it in my CD player.     'Hip-O' is a Universal music group subsidiary label, usually known for their high quality repackaging and remastering of older titles, and the 'Hip-O Select' titles are limited releases of albums that are perhaps not popular enough for the expense of a wide release. Judging from previous 'Hip-O' issues I've purchased, I expected this re-release to be the ultimate mastering of this classic album, but alas I was wrong. While the bass response is fine, all of the high end frequencies are compressed, giving the CD a muddy sound, more appropriate from an old, well played cassette tape.    At first I thought it might have been the CD player I was using, but I tried it on another, and it sounded the same. I then pulled out the previous import CD release I have and played the first track for comparison; The sound was bright clean and clear with great bass and crisp highs. This from a CD released in 1992!    I cannot adequately express how deeply disappointed I am in this remastering, especially since it cost me more for this version than the first one I bought. Giorgio's album deserved better than this. I am truly amazed that 'Hip-O' allowed this shoddy a product to be released under their name.    If you truly want the best version of this album, there are two previous releases available. While I cannot vouch for the version on the 'Repertoire' label ( having never heard it ) I can wholeheartedly recommend the 1992 release on the 'Castle Records' label from Germany, as it is the other copy I own and is definitely superior to the American 'Hip-O Select' release.    Disappointing, to say the least.
B002JVWRAO|3.0|The CW series \\"Supernatural\\" just keeps going and growing and growing. Season 5 was originally planned to be the final season for the series, but things, thankfully, changed. I have been a fan of this show from the very first episode. The series has continued to develop and deepen with each passing season. I certainly have my favorites, but there is no denying the richness and depth that each new year contains. That being said, season 5 would come in fifth place for me if I was to rank my favorite seasons. But first things first....    At the end of the wonderful season 4(which many believe to be the show's best season), the devil, Lucifer, was set free. The season 5 season premiere, \\"Lucifer Rising\\", picks up where we left off. Sam and Dean(Jared Padalecki, Jensen Ackles) prepare for the devil, learn shocking news about Castiel(Misha Collins), and Lucifer finds himself a host body. From here on out, the 22 episode season has the boys trying to find a way to stop Lucifer from bringing about the apocalypse. Those apocalypses are always pains! Like seasons past, there are fun, more stand alone episodes. \\"Fallen Idols\\" have certain objects of the past(like the car James Dean was killed in)killing people of the present. It's a fun idea, and it features a brief cameo by Paris Hilton. Yes, I said Paris Hilton. It's not as bad as you think. If you loathe Ms.Hilton, you should still be happy. Elsewhere, there is the absolutely hysterical \\"Changing Channels\\". Sam and Dean find themselves trapped in different kinds of TV shows - sitcom, hospital drama, CSI-type show, etc. It's a fun episode playing on the cliches of these shows, and gets a chance to take some digs on the overwhelming abundance of procedural and medical shows. It put a huge smile on my face. \\"The Real Ghostbusters\\" was a lot of fun as well. The boys go to a Supernatural convention, where people are dressed up like them, when they encounter a very real haunting. Another hysterical episode. After that, it's nota lot of fun and games. We are in Lucifer/Apocalypse territory, and it is the core focus of the season, even though you don't see a whole lot of Lucifer. \\"Abandon All Hope\\" is a massive episode that features a shocking demise; \\"My Bloody Valentine\\" is a pretty cool episode about a murderous Cupid; \\"The Song Remains The Same\\" is a sequel to season 4's \\"In The Beginning\\", when the boys travel back to the 70s to see their young parents. The finale, \\"Swan Song\\", is a little subdued and understated given we are dealing with the apocalypse. Still, the last several minutes had me on the edge of my seat contemplating the future of several characters.    Even though there is a lot of good in season 5, it is my least favorite. The whole storyline didn't seem to be as big as it should of been(probably thanks to budgetary reasons), and the second half of the season focused heavily on it and a number of the episodes all kind of ran together. This was the first season of the show where it was hard for me to differentiate some episodes. That being said, Ackles and Padalecki continue to do great work, and the direction of the show remains top notch. There was just a 'spark' that was missing from this season, that was apparent in all past seasons. A certain sense of fun just wasn't quite there. Maybe it was deliberate, given the dour situation of season 5's story arc, but it was a little hard going and boring in many places.    In the end, season 5 of \\"Supernatural\\", given it's shortcomings to me, still remained good TV, and will most definitley find it's way on my shelf next to the last 4 seasons, despite it not being quite as satisfying. However, the very end of the season finale sets up some very interesting questions for season 6. From what I have heard, season 6 will be a return to form. I am excited.

B003VJTGLQ|5.0|I loved this movie since the first time I saw in on dvd in 1999.  It is one of those movies that I consider to be a classic like Pulp Fiction.  If you haven't seen this movie, please do.  Emotional movies like this make a deep impact with me.  When Wes Bentley is talking during the bag floating scene makes me wanna cry.  Sometimes there's so much beauty in the world.
B003JTHESA|5.0|Thank heaven for maiden, Steve Harris says this is the last but I say don't quit while your ahead. This album contains a little bit of everything they've done over a 30 year career. I myself a maiden fan would'nt say anything bad about maiden anyway. The Final Frontier is classic maiden if you like the old stuff you'll love this album. Bruce Dickinsons vocals are amazing, the guitar work unreal, drums wonderful. Stop reading and buy it now !! Maiden never fails !
B003ZUTVJS|5.0|I've not been a big fan of Claire Danes, my exposure to her work being inadequate vehicles such as Terminator 3. Therefore I was prepared to be underwhelmed by this movie but instead was completely blown away. The story of Temple Grandin is an interesting one to be sure but Claire's representation was sheer genius. Put the two together and this is one exceptional movie. I was also surprised to discover this was an HBO made for tv movie. It was easily better than any cinematic release I've seen in a long, long time. At the end of this movie I found myself shedding tears of joy. I'm not sure if they were for the incredible accomplishment of Temple Grandin or that of Claire Danes. Perhaps the correct answer is both. The average rating of this movie is five stars out of five. Critics were similarly generous. I can't think of another movie I could recommend so highly. Don't miss it. Then, after you've seen it, share it with all your friends.
0312330537|4.0|I really enjoyed this book. It is like a roman, but based on a true story. Great read.
B002PMV9FG|1.0|i received this movie last week. tried to watch it last night. the acting is crummy and the movie was so dark you could not make out what was happening. i have read all the harry potter books and think they are terrific. i also have all the other movies and they are very good. why would they release such a crummy movie?
0756405890|5.0|This was a great book that was fun to read. It's actually a tragedy closer to the vein of the Odyssey than your standard fantasy. Kvothe, the main character is developed incredibly well and it's a real treat reading a book that cleverly sends you off track and doesn't allude too much.
1400052173|5.0|Author writes lucidly and brings to life Henrietta Lacks, the source of HeLa cells. Rebecca Skloot's first book is a winner. I couldn't put it down. She explains the science of tissue culture and weaves into it the story of a black family and their trials and the injustices they suffered.

1429252553|1.0|The product is titled as Inorganic Chemistry, and the presented authors for this product are Shriver & Atkins.  However, it is the Solutions Manual that accompanies the Shriver and Atkins Inorganic Chemistry book, and Amazon does nothing to clarify the difference between the two.  The way Shriver & Atkins are referred to as the author of this product is very misleading.  The Manual itself seems decent enough, has full descriptions of the solutions to each problem, covering both in chapter and end of chapter problems.
1594202559|5.0|This is a good book and well worth reading. For myself, there was only one reason to read this book and that was to obtain more information on the Medallion methodology. The author does provide information that hitherto was not public. For this I am grateful, but I would have liked, even more, a really deep interview with the various individuals involved in the development of Medallion.<br /><br />For example, Berlekamp presents himself, on his website, as the creator of Medallion and the solver of its trading problems. He kicks himself for selling his share of this cash-generating marvel to the ruthless Medallion Pool Operator Owner for only six times the amount he had invested. I guess his intense need to play Dots and Boxes just overwhelmed his common sense.<br /><br />An interview with the two Russians who thumbed their noses at the Pool Operator Owner would have been most interesting especially since they claim that there are illegal trading activities taking place.<br /><br />Henry Laufer is stated to be the discoverer of the critical trading strategy currently used by Medallion but there was no interview with him. Were these professionals too terrified of retribution by the Pool Operator Owner to speak their mind?<br /><br />Why did Nick Patterson quit and leave Medallion? His reasons would have been illuminating. Why did Peter Weinberger up and quit after holding the position of Chief Technology Officer? Why has Robert Frey pulled the pin?<br /><br />The author discloses the disgusting hypocritical behavior of a famous eConomist (accent on the Con) who teaches his students to follow Fama's ridiculous Efficient Market Hypothesis during the day while secretly investing in Warren Buffett's Berkshire at night.<br /><br />The book reveals the interviews the author has had with the various members of the hedge fund menagerie, such as 2-Door, Davy Unicorn, Soros and his Reflexivity thing, James Robertson, Bruce Kovner and others. An entertaining tome, to be sure.
B00005221M|5.0|\\"They are a breed apart and make no sense\\" That is my favorite line from this great<br />action film. I saw it on the big screen and was riveted. Just lately I saw it on TV and it still held me transfixed. Besides great acting from all, the movie captured time , place and realistic horror of war. The directing and pacing was excellent.
B002BU0DPE|1.0|I bought them and used them on my ps3. everything is fine. i connect it to my xbox360 and the dang wire that came with the headset that connect to you controller for voice chat is defective. they sold me a broken piece of c!!!i saw a video on the internet were a kid was showing how to set it up and his came broken too. they of course have replacements that they will gladly SELL you! but if im paying 80 for a pair of headphones then they should work!!!!!! bottom line is dont buy from turtle beach. get another brand.
B002ZG995E|5.0|With all of the re-makes that have been made of older TV series, this is about as close as they have come to the real series. Great cast with a mixture of drama, comedy and adventure. If this was to become a TV series using  this cast of main characters, I would enjoy it as much as I did the original.
B0036EH3U2|4.0|I wish in the DVDs and BluRays, the deleted scenes were reinserted as an optional other version so we could see the 'whole' vision not just the 44 min version. Also the commentaries were pretty lame. I want to hear about the making of the episode not what RDM's wife is doing, or the dog, or the garbage trucks. More actor summariries would be  nice what they were thinking of the storyline or the episode.
B003HARV3Y|2.0|I didn't like this movie because of the negative aspects in it. It could have been much better if they would have stuck with the book. The affects are good but the story lines is a little choppy. I wonder if any of this directors even read the books! The supporting actor gave the movie its worst features. I don't recommend this movie to anyone.
B002N5N5M0|4.0|I am a huge fan of Dexter, I love the first novel and I have adored the first three seasons. But the fourth year of Dexter starts to fall short in the great acclaim the series is known for. I kept hearing rave reviews and I found numerous articles giving honor to Lithgow, so this led me to believe the fourth season of Dexter was going to be superior to others before it. This is far from the truth, and honestly this is the weakest season for the series.  What kills the rush and intensity of this year is the love story between LaGuerta and Balista. The writing for this subplot was poor and rushed. It definitely feels like filler so episodes would fit the time frame to be shown on Showtime. Frankly it is not important at all, and it reminds me of the stupid, pointless office romances and office altercations that writers put in 24 as filler. Only die hard fans of the LaGuerta and Balista will enjoy it. For the majority of Dexter fans, they will be thinking \\"Who cares, give me more with Trinity and Dexter!\\" The romance slows down the show and it easily could be edited out of the season to make this year a none stop thrill ride.   Debra also is a major drag. One would think she would be a lot more mature as the series has progressed over four years, but Morgan still has a lot of growing up to do. Debra is still very selfish, makes really stupid actions, and is very judgmental of those who are different from herself. These character traits personally have left me very annoyed with Debra and I could a really use a break from subplots dealing with her screwed up love life. It was entertaining in season one but after season three, I could care less.   With those criticisms for season four out of the way, I will say that the rest of the show is fantastic. Everything with Dexter and Trinity is heart pounding. The details of Dexter adjusting to being a husband, father, and a resident in suburbia is very captivating and I wish there had been more of that instead of the LaGuerta and Balista subplot. Writers should have dealt with Rita getting very close to discovering Dexter's tools, trophies, and learning what he does late at night, but that doesn't really occur.  Next season, writers should start the story right after Dexter finds Rita murdered. The cops need to immediately place Dexter as a suspect (he doesn't have an alibi because Rita was the only one who thought she knew where he was), Trinity should have left planted evidence to frame Dexter for the murder, have the grandparents take the kids under their care, then have Dexter on the run as he tries and figure out how to prove his innocence, and Debra can spend her entire time working to discover who really killed Rita or she can even help Dexter run. Dexter could discover a new killer to stop and frame for the murder of Rita. That would be a good story for season five.   So if the writers avoid the flaws from season four which were pointless love stories that were given way too much screen time, season five should be good. Dexter and events relating to Dexter's story need to be the sole things taking screen time. Keep the soundtrack because the salsa music is wonderful and I personally look forward to another soundtrack to be released. Debra needs to be more mature and more of a character who purposely helps Dexter and the police solve crimes right from the start instead of making stupid mistakes which unwittingly aid the police in their investigation. Give the fans more details of Quinn and his antics (He's not killing people on the side too is he? Because that means he and Dexter would have to square off.). If these guidelines had been followed in season four, I would have given it five stars instead of four. If they aren't followed, Dexter is going to continue to teeter in its quality of intensity and the first season will remain to be the superior within the series.
B002ZG9968|1.0|HOpe you have a back up movie to watch if you rent this one. It was a disappointment from the beginning. The story line was okay not moral but okay. The acting was slow and hard to watch. Some scenes and dialog I would not recommend to my 13 year old. Can't recommend this movie.
1594481784|4.0|I finally got around to reading this book after hearing my music geek friends rave about it for years and seeing part of the movie version with John Cusack which transported the story to the U.S. - still effective, as breakups and record geekery happen here too, but also somewhat removed from the essential Englishness of the original story.  After wombling around as to whether this book deserved three or four stars, I settled on four, because the writing skills of Nick Hornby succeed in humanizing a basically unlikeable protagonist.    The story is set in 1995 London, showing its age a bit to the extent it talks about Walkmans and mixtapes and other relics of the pre-digital music era.  The main character, Rob, is a thirtysomething owner of a small struggling record shop that caters to vinyl collectors (and by the present time would almost certainly be out of business) whose life revolves around his own huge record collection, nights out with fellow music geeks the \\"Musical Moron Twins\\" who work in his shop, and his efforts to come to terms with his relationships with women.  At the beginning of the story, Rob's longterm live-in girlfriend, Laura, has just dumped him in favor of moving in with their former neighbor.  Rob reminisces on the most devastating breakups of his life, most of which turn out to have happened when he was a very young man,and one of which caused him to flunk school, stalk his ex and eventually end up running a failing record shop.  Despite Rob's constant attempts to justify his feelings and behavior by suggesting that he's a sort of Everyman, and men in general think the same way he does about women and relationships (this is, sadly, true to some extent), it's also clear that Rob's problems largely stem from his maturity clock getting stopped somewhere short of his actual age.  As the story moves along and Rob vacillates between trying to cajole Laura back to him (and find out if she's having s-e-x with the neighbor and is he better than Rob in bed, etc. - how schoolboyish can a 35-year-old get?) and capitalize on his single state by boffing other women, my biggest question became what pretty Laura, with her professional career that was paying both of their bills, ever saw in this broke immature loser in the first place.  A possible clue lies in a suggestion that Laura is attracted to \\"lost little boy\\" types who she feels she can help, or maybe despite her professional image she relates to the insecurities they feel.  The ending is somewhat happy in that Rob seems to be finally getting on with the business of growing up, but I still doubted (as Laura apparently also does) Rob's ability to keep up the good work and turn into an actual man rather than some kid worried about proving his attractiveness/ sexual prowess, or just looking for some continuous new spark of romance.    Rob's supposed devotion to music also comes off a little weird.  Here is a guy in mid-90s London who presumably has been exposed to all sorts of exciting punk, post-punk, rave, Britpop and who knows what, yet his favorite records are old pedantic yuppie-rock classics like the Beatles and Motown.  The author sneaks in the occasional obscure collector's reference, and maybe a love of Motown in mid-90s London really made people stand out from the pack (I wouldn't know, being American) but it seems more likely that Rob's musical taste is stuck along with his emotional maturity somewhere back in the pre-Bowie era. Either that or the author didn't want to include too many off-the-wall bands for fear of alienating the larger reading audience.  Rob's pals and store employees, the \\"Musical Moron Twins\\", are much better drafted as realistic portrayals of music snobs/ record geeks and their antics carry a lot of the book (as they also did in the movie).  If this were just a story about some middle-aged guy having a relationship crisis and listening to old Motown, it would fall much more flat.      This book made me really glad I've been marriedfor a long time and don't have to \\"date\\" anymore, because sadly there are a lot of Robs in this world.  I'm sure that's a big reason for the book's popularity, just as there are a lot of women who think and act like Bridget Jones.  Nevertheless, it's a fast read and has some fun parts mostly revolving around the record-shop doings.  I'd have liked more of that and less of Rob navelgazing about his girlfriends.
0312945973|5.0|**Warning-Possible Spoilers**<br /><br />I recently re-read Wilber Smith's epic River God and noticed a serious flaw in the logic of the story.<br /><br />Upon the Egyptian's first encounter with the Hyksos, they are treated to a military encounter of ancient \\"shock & awe\\" as they are roundly defeated by the Hyksos use of chariots and horses in battle. It is explained that the Egyptians, having never before seen or encountered horses in their land, quickly denounce them as being supernatural creatures of the underworld, and they promptly proceed to slaughter the \\"evil monsters\\" upon encountering them a second time. Tanus never overcomes his enmity of horses, steadfastly refusing to ride like Taita, although he does come to value their military advantage.<br /><br />All perfectly logical, except...<br /><br />In the earlier part of the novel Taita, on one of his spy missions to investigate the bandits (Shrikes) attacking Egyptian trade and villages, clearly encounters a merchant and his very pregnant wife \\"riding on a burro/donkey/ass.\\"<br /><br />Granted, horses of the type employed by the Hyksos (likely small steppe horses or Przewalski's Horse) are larger and faster than burros. However, it would be clear to anyone, and especially someone as intelligent as Taita, that a burro/donkey/ass looks and acts an awfully a lot like a horse! If the Egyptians were already utilizing burros/asses as beasts of burden, the introduction of the Hyksos horses should not have been such a complete and utter revelation!<br /><br />Sorry, but it just bothered me. I still loved this novel though. It is, without a doubt, one of Smith's best adventures, and Taita is one of the best characters (literally-LOL!) ever.

1845761502|5.0|I am an aspiring video game/special effects/creature character design student and am I glad I purchased this book. The content is unbelievably inspirational as it explains how Stan Winston came to become one of the, if not \\"thee\\" greatest special effects pioneer/master ever. It reveals Stan's mentality of curiousity and desire to push creative bounderies, and how he went from award winning make-up artist to puppetry, taking from Jim Henson's muppet wizardry to another level by creating realistic and monster \\"puppets\\" for movies, to todays CGI. In the book Winston explains his thought process and problems and solutions for many of my favorite movies as well as steps in designing/creating many of my favorite movie creatures like The Thing, Alien, Terminator, Predator and countless more. The pictures are spectacular and there are many of them including behind the scene pics, various awesome artist Art & paintings & Character/Creature designs from Crash McCreery and Aaron Sims. Basically the book is a:<br />-Winston biography.<br />-History of Special Effects.<br />-\\"The Art of the Film\\" for a sh*tload of top movies.<br />-Behind the scenes pics and personal stories for a sh*tload of top movies.<br />-An incredibly interesting motivating & captivating read.<br />All of this for $[...] (which I paid thru Amazon) is a complete steal and definitely a must have if you aspire to study or simply enjoy the special effects process.
069111966X|5.0|Joseph R. Dell'Aquila, Ph.D.<br />My first exposure to this book was probably as a young college student. When I started teaching physics and mathematics at the college and university level, I recommended this book to all of my students. Why? The table-like pages xvi - xvii are an excellent reminder of fruitful ways to understand, think about, attack and solve problems. Although I am a PhD in theoretical physics, I still dip into it occasionally when I need some insight or want to recall what I knew about approaching a problem. Is the book at that high a level? Of course not. It is a basic introduction to the fundamentals of problem solving. But remember that Michael Jordan, in \\"I Can't Accept Not Trying,\\" always thanked Dean Smith, his famous college coach - who would bench Jordan if he got sloppy - for teaching him the fundamentals and Jordan said within a page of that: \\"fundamentals, that's what made Larry Bird such a great player.\\" That is all this book is trying to give, fundamentals, and it does so brilliantly. To those whose reviews said it was not helpful and wanted to know where was the graduate level analysis, if you want to stick with Polya try \\"Inequalities\\" by G. H. Hardy, J. E. Littlewood, G. P&oacute;lya, all great to exceptional mathematicians with plenty of analysis to share and, for more specialized work, Isoperimetric Inequalities in Mathematical Physics by Polya and Szego. Note that one computer scientist/programmer disliked the book but another lauded it. I would never want to restrict dialogue on review but please check out the appropriateness and level of any book you buy. I have rarely written negative reviews on Amazon or elsewhere because I do my homework: using the Internet to find information on the work and even going to a library to see whether I like what their copy offers (I'm phrasing it this way because different editions, perhaps the library's edition vs. the one you're considering purchasing, can be quite different). Buy and use Polya if it is appropriate to your needs.
B002ZG974M|5.0|I watched this documentary recently in whilst on holidays in Europe. There was no spoken commentary and that was a bonus for a film like this.    If you are interested in human development - here it all is before you in the first year of life of four healthy babies growing up in caring environments. All the milestones from a Child health and development point of view and interesting observations of baby caregiver interactions are here to see in 4 different cultural environments.    This documentary also brings home the vast differences in the two more western environments -US and Japan, and the contrast of the Mongolian environment and the baby growing up in a very different environment in Namibia.    What we can learn from this documentary is that normal healthy human babies growing up in loving families and stable environments develop physically and emotionally in much the same ways despite all the things that we tend to think are essential in our western culture.    We see a vast contrast in the cultural environment in which the Namibian baby lives, for example, and our western culture where we tend to feel we need to have a vast array of purchased toys for each stage of development, lots of fashionable clothing, and often we are so isolated we really do need to attend mothers groups for contact with other mothers and to and learn from each other, and then there are baby gym classes to attend.     We can see from the other environments how all this tends to happen quite naturally in the Namibian group and in the Mongolian family it is different again due to the family's need to survive in their environment.    As a bonus, there are also the beautiful scenic backdrops of the locations.    Whilst this documentary is delightful to watch for anyone who adores babies, the important message here could be that healthy babies who are born into caring families who interact with them and give provide opportunities for learning end up developing normally in much the same ways, in these vastly different cultural environments.

B002JCSWV6|5.0|Morgan Freeman is one of my favorite actors.  Which is why I had to watch this movie.  Pretty much anything with him in it is fair game.  And I gotta say, this was a fantastic movie.<br /><br />Freeman plays Nelson Mandela who has recently been elected President after Apartheid ends in South Africa.  Its a time of turmoil however as for the first time black people are given freedoms they haven't had and it makes those who held power for a long time very nervous. Mandela seeks to calm these fears and bring about peace and understanding.  And he chooses to do it a very unique way; Rugby.<br /><br />A violent sport to be sure but also very near and dear to South Africans.  Francois Pienaar (Matt Damon) is the captain of the Springboks, South Africa's rugby team.  The World Cup is coming to South Africa and the Bokkes have not been playing the best.  Mandela meets with Pienaar and lets him know that he has great expectations for the team, and gives him some inspiration as well.  He also mandates that the Springboks start holding practices with some of the poorer children of the country for greater public appreciation of the team. In between this and their harsh training, its a very long chance that they will be able to win the cup.<br /><br />The characters for the most part in this movie are very believable.  Considering that apartheid was not too long before Mandel meets with these players though, I was amazed that the movie showed them all giving him the greatest respect.  I would have though a few team members might have been less than respectful in reality.<br /><br />The best thing about this movie was the soundtrack.  Great music and singing and it seemed very true to Africa.  I'm a big fan of World music and the soundtrack did not disappoint in this aspect.<br /><br />Overall the message was one of triumph and overcoming adversity.  I'm always a big fan of feel-good movies and this one didn't disappoint.  When you find yourself unconsciously smiling through the second half of the movie, you know its good.  I also shed a few tears as well.  Clint Eastwood did a marvelous job with this movie and the love and hard work in it truly shows.ood.  I also shed a few tears as well.

B0015OKWL2|1.0|Deniro & Pacino were awesome together 15 years ago in \\"Heat\\" directed by Michael Mann, but they are equally awfull together in this film. They are both too old and too fat to be believeable as 'bad-ass cops' here in a movie with a plot that is both dull & dumb. In the special features they keep referring to Deniro and Pacino as 'icons' of acting--and they are and deservedly so. But great actors can't do anything about a bad script and being cast in parts they should no longer take on. Deniro has crossed over into comedy (Analyze This) and has been hilarious. Pacino hasn't done anything memorable to me for quite awhile--but he's still great. But this movie is a total turkey and not worth your time.

B002RWKSII|5.0|\\"How do you review a genius, much less two? The simple answer is... you don't. In the musical arena, you just sit back, listen and enjoy. Of course there will be the professional critics who can't resist mentioning that some 45 years later, Brian's voice isn't what it used to be. (Gee, what a revelation!!) There will be those who will say that this isn't the Brian Wilson that they know and love. Finally, there will be the unspoken majority who just marvel that at age 68, Brian Wilson continues to prove why he is one of the major musical geniuses of the 20th century. Brian, just keep singing. Your music speaks for itself.\\" (Customer review)     Right, right! But I'll give it a try all the same.     OUR RHAPSODY (INTRO):  Brian sang his own Prayer with the Band, but for George's Prayer (the \\"Love Theme\\" from Rhapsody In Blue) it is a Stack o' Brians. Right: this is his childhood music, a very private thing. He says that he is a good harmony singer - and he is.     I was very disappointed when I knew that one of my favourite music pieces would be present only as snippets, but I am reconciled with that now. There are so many great orchestral takes around, that one more was not really needed, and doing the whole piece with vocals would have been an epic endeavour - with boring result, maybe. Maybe.     GEE... THE LIKE IN I LOVE YOU?  The first collaboration. Gershwin, Wilson, Bennett, with a sparkle of stardust.     I did not like this song at first listen(s): too sugary sweet for me, with an obscure title. I had not noticed the sparkle. It's a grower, and works surprisingly well in the context of the album.  Could become another classic for nostalgic audiences. Good lyrics by Scott except for that \\"duplicate the Universe\\" - I wish that line could be changed. But \\"the pain in painting\\", \\"the great in grateful\\" and, of course, \\"the like in I love you\\" (I got it at last) make up for it.    WIND CHIMES IN SUMMERTIME:  What do you do with this all-too-known \\"number\\" if you aren't Ella Fitzgerald? Go to the other end of the spectrum. Sing it with a gruff, tired voice, and arrange it as creepy as possible: heavy blues shuffle, muted horns, eerie choirs and strings, menacing orchestral crescendo in the end.     I was almost dreading this. Never thought that Brian's would become my favourite take on this song.      I LOVES YOU, BRIAN:  Why does Brian love this song so much, besides the obvious - that it's great? He has good reasons to relate to it: both musical (the clear \\"Ol' Man River\\" overtones in the choruses) and lyrical (\\"Don't let him handle me...\\").     Whoever but Brian could carry this off so gracefully? Come on, name one... He couldn't care less that he is singing a love song to a man: he puts all his heart in it. A proof of courage and openness of mind that many listeners, as could well be expected, \\"don't get\\".     I GOT PLENTY O' BARNYARD:  This was not really composed by Gershwin. It is the original instrumental track for \\"Barnyard\\", recovered from the Lost Mammoth SMiLE Sessions Cave Complex, where the 2-hours versions of Good Vibrations, H & V, Surf's Up and The Elements are hidden and the tunnels resonate with echoes of \\"With Me Tonight\\" takes.     Fantastic fun piece: as the Barn Hillbilly Orchestra, the Band shines.    FAV MOMENT 1: As someone said in a comment, at 1:10 you experience synesthesia and clearly see \\"a pigeon flying from the barnyard up to the roof of the barn\\".  FAV MOMENT 2: At the end, rhythm slows and strings (with a delightful cello at the lead) play the \\"Tag Theme\\" from Rhapsody In Blue (that WAS composed by Gerhwin).      IT AIN'T NECESSARILY SHORTENIN' BREAD, MAN:  Even heavier blues shuffle: Brian sounds like he has real fun with this. Good gruff lead, grunting and roaring horns, great touches in the backing vocals. The tag, with eerie strings, returns unexpectedly (but powerfully) to the almost-sinister atmosphere of \\"Summertime\\".    A worthy close to the excellent \\"Porgy and Bess\\" sub-suite.    'S WONDERFUL (?):  Breezil...  Silly songlet with silly lyrics: I shudder at the thought of the flack Scott would get if he had written them.     I knew I wouldn't like this and I don't. My least favourite song in the album: maybe fine enough if you can stand Bossa Nova. Love the flute, but in other contexts. \\"Wonderful\\" is surely incomparably better, but then even \\"Mexican Girl\\" is better. Well, adds to the number of musical styles represented here.     Miraculously, the flow of the album is NOT interrupted anyway. And, thankfully, another highlight now...    THEY CAN'T TAKE SURF AWAY FROM ME:  \\"On my way to sunny California...\\": time for some good ole Beach Boy surf stomp.    Boogity Boogity Boogity Boogity Shoo! Call me a child. I love the \\"scat\\" Brian, perhaps, better than any other, and here we are. Pure bliss.    FAV MOMENT 3: all the scat moments, of course!    YOU WERE MY SUNSHINE, BUT LOVE IS HERE TO STAY:  Wow. Brian sounds almost like Frank Sinatra here. Didn't expect he could do that! Good vibes, in more than one sense... including theremin at the end. Didn't expect that either...    I knew I wouldn't like this. I DO instead. Excellent lead vocals. And so relaxing! If I had any doubt, the theremin dissolved it.     FAV MOMENT 4: the theremin tag.    LOOK, I'VE GOT A CRUSH ON YOU:  Doo-wop they say. Silly, tongue-in-cheek song. Rather delightful, with outstanding slide guitar sometimes combined with a sax.     But wait, a crush on her isn't the only thing Brian has got...     I GOT RHYTHM, I GOT MUSIC, I GOT CALIFORNIA GIRLS:  \\"On my way to sunny California...\\" Brian and Band do it again. They start rocking with the Rhapsody \\"Stride Theme\\", and never stop.       Brian's take on \\"I Got Rhythm\\" has been variously criticised, but I couldn't care less. It's pure bliss for me, in a way other versions of the song can't approach. I love the \\"American in Paris\\" movie and love the scene where Gene Kelly sings and dances it, but I am enchanted by the dance rather than the song, good as it is. But redone as a mid-sixties Beach Boys hit, full of sun and joy, it's simply exhilarating. And at the same time, it's not nostalgia, it is here and now.    FAV MOMENT 5: the whole song! I start singing it at odd moments.    CAROLINE, NO... SOMEONE HAS TO WATCH OVER ME:  Starts with the \\"Shuffle Theme\\" from Rhapsody, played by a string quartet. The rest must be an unused song from the \\"Pet Sounds\\" sessions - strange that they did not include it in the album at the time. Harpsichord, cello, clopping percussion, great bass line, the harmonies... the works.    Seriously now, would not be out of place in \\"Pet Sounds\\". Enough said.      FAV MOMENT 6: again, the whole song!    NOTHING BUT LOVE, IN BLUE HAWAII:  The second collaboration. Though undoubtedly Gershwin has a big say in it too, sounds tremendously like current Brian (a better \\"Message Man\\"). Cool baritone sax riffs by Paul. It has two tags, like Vegetables in the Good Vibrations box set. The first one is quintessential Beach Boys scat singing plus sax, then the second one starts with an angelic \\"Nothing but love\\" (Scott, I think) followed by the \\"Gates of Heaven\\" Blue Hawaii tag (yes!), introducing the Rhapsody \\"Stride Theme\\" in the strings.     Would be a great, happy fun song on its own merits. But the tags... Goosebumps!    FAV MOMENT 7: the tags - and this is, possibly, my favourite moment in the whole album.    OUR RHAPSODY (REPRISE):  Perfect tonal resolution. Wall o' Brians again. Like the final \\"extra\\" track in TLOS.     And, just like it, far too short. Only remedy is starting again from the beginning.      WRAPUP:  Brian did not sing so well since... when? And when did he learn jazz phrasing?    What can we say about the Band? Vocally, they aren't the Beach Boys. Nobody is. But they are good enough, and some. Instrumentally, they are just near perfect. Somebody says that Paul Mertens, with his fabulous arrangement work, is the \\"unsung hero\\" of this album. Let's hope that this will not prove true and his praises will be sung like he deserves.    I am amazed at how well BWRG flows together. Was not betting on that. Like Pet Sounds, SMiLE and TLOS, to really appreciate it should not be listened at like a collection of songs, but a 39 minutes suite. \\"Variations in Blue\\".    Not for all tastes. The cynic and the trendy will never get it. Nor many purists, either of George Gershwin or of Brian Wilson.     Let's not forget the Gershwins, by the way. They wrote (almost) all you are hearing tonight... Now, where did I hear this before?    Fun. Upbeat. Emotional. Schmaltzy. Amazing. Five stars.

0780622553|1.0|I should have read the reviews before I purchased this but this was my first blu-ray disc and I was a little too hasty. When you first put it in you hear something - then as the movie progresses you hear more... what is that?

DO NOT PURCHASE if you expect to play the sound via HDMI into a TV like I did.

B000001A3H|2.0|I have a very large metal collection and constantly am trying new bands, and old ones. This album is far from groundbreaking for its time. First of all, it's more closely aligned to grunge sound than metal. Boring riffs, some pretty lame lyrics (no shoes I wear thongs - seriously?) and delivery. For its time, I'd pick Soundgarden any day, at least Chris can sing.<br /><br />Now I know why this genre is called stoner rock, because you'd have to be smoking something to give this album the praise it's been given. If you want crunchy hard riffs, there are better ways to spend your money, if you want musicianship, look elsewhere, if you want a great metal album, this isn't it. I just started getting into Corrosion of Conformity, a band from that era, and the album Deliverance showed the same day as this one. It's not even a contest which album is better, heavier, more epic, better produced. I'll sadly add this album and the other Kyuss album I ordered to my collection but after several critical listenings I think it's gonna collect a whole lot of dust. Really disappointed actually, I wanted to like this.<br /><br />Highly, highly overrated.

And although I had high expections going in, it exceeded them so completely that I'm almost at a loss for words.<br /><br />This series is everything that's good about British TV - brilliantly sharp writing, fantastic acting, perfect casting, stunningly filmed, full of humor and wit and tension and even a touch of the surreal. And downright scary at times too.<br /><br />To Sherlock Holmes fans, you will be delighted at how well he translates into the 21st century - complete with shooting at the walls and debating about the merits of knowing that the earth revolves around the sun. Watson is a bit different than he is in the original, but it's only an improvement - he is our eyes and our emotions, and he could not possibly be a more perfect character, or played by a more perfect actor, to carry the moral and emotional weight of the series. And Sherlock himself - disturbed, possibly damaged, clearly self-destructive, but utterly charming - is one of the greatest reinventions I have ever seen. In fact, probably the greatest ever.<br /><br />I honestly never thought any TV series could surpass Life on Mars as my favorite. And while we're only three episodes in (because there HAS to be more), I can honestly say that Sherlock is better.
B000R7GKQE|5.0|Supernatural: The Complete Season 2 is a great addition to any collection. I have really enjoyed experiencing my favorite episodes all over again and getting a chance to watch it with my sisters. I love watching Jensen and Jared portray Dean and Sam in this awesome TV show. I can't wait to see what's coming for Season 6! I would recommend Supernatural to anyone.

B000ION23A|4.0|Talking insects make for good computer generated animation.  Pixar knew this (A Bug's Life), Dreamworks knew it (Antz and the Bee Movie), and it hasn't escaped the attention of Tom Hanks either.<br /><br />Boasting an 83-minute runtime, the Ant Bully wastes very little time setting up its plot.<br /><br />This is essentially the story of a ten-year-old boy named Lucas Nickle, who, because of his small stature, finds himself the target for the local bully and his cronies.<br /><br />When he discovers that his parents are leaving for a honeymoon in Puerto Vallarta, Lucas finds himself under the supervision of his techno-happy older sister and their UFO-obsessed grandmother.<br /><br />Because he is powerless to stand up for himself, Lucas finds himself taking out his frustration on an anthill in his front yard; water guns, hoses, firecrackers, Lucas' tormenting means doom for the terrified ants occupying the hill.<br /><br />It turns out the anthill's resident wizard Zoc has devised a risky plan that could potentially shrink \\"The Destroyer\\" down to the size of the ants so that he could be tried properly for his crimes against the colony.<br /><br />The adventure really begins when rather than sentence the now pint-sized human boy to prison; the ant counsel decides he is to experience the difficulties of daily life as an ant.  In the process, Lucas discovers that the things he wants most out of life: friendship, companionship, and the courage to stand up for himself have been at his disposal all along.  And more important still, that size is no measurement of strength.<br /><br />Naturally it's quite impossible to even encounter this film without being mentally drawn back to the early days of computer-animated blockbusters like A Bug's Life and Antz.  And indeed nearly a decade of advancements in technology separating this film from the former two doesn't seem to have been as kind to the Ant Bully as it has been to some of the projects coming out of Pixar or Dreamworks.  However, what the Ant Bully does have going for it is a decent story that adults can enjoy while the kids marvel at the spectacle of life as seen from the perspective of a human no bigger than an ant.<br /><br />While calling it gut-busting humorous would certainly be giving the writing a bit too much credit, there are no shortage of sequences that manage to generate a genuine chuckle from viewers of all ages (my own personal giggle-heavy moment arrives when Lucas detonates a firecracker that to him is the size of a school bus).<br /><br />Though it's not made overly known in the marketing material, the film is actually the result of Tom Hanks' adoration for the children's book of the same name by John Nickel.<br /><br />Voice work is especially genuine throughout with Julia Roberts giving a very uncharacteristic (natural) performance and Nicolas Cage walking the thin line between a character you either despise or sort of don't hate.<br /><br />In all there's little doubt that the Ant Bully failed to generate the type of spark for Warner Brothers that would make Disney/ Pixar, Dreamworks, or Blue Sky stutter but the blame can hardly be placed on the film itself for that.  This is 89-minutes worth of fun family-oriented entertainment with some solid morals about life forming the foundation of the whimsy at hand.  The fact that the DVD contains 7 additional animated shorts, some of which are truly pretty humorous, is the icing on the cake.is a decent story that adults can enjoy while the kids marvel at the spectacle of life as seen from the perspective of a human no bigger than an ant.

I thought this book started out a little slowly, but as I read along I saw Ms Shaffer was building her cast of characters and she did her job so well I was never lost as to who was writting who.  I read my copy on my Kindle, but liked it so well I bought a copy for a gift.

B002ZG97RE|3.0|As a former US Army Infantry Officer, I thought this film would be especially interesting, and it was. However, it confirms my opinion of liberal hollywood people: that they're simply not very smart. That's why they become actors and actresses - because 98% of them weren't smart enough to become doctors or lawyers or businessmen. Most of them never even went to college. Because of this lack of education, most hollywood types lack any real talent for critical thinking.<br /><br />This whole movie was a propaganda message, trying to convince the viewer that there never were any WMDs (Weapons of Mass Destruction) in Iraq. First of all, too many people don't know what weapons qualify as a \\"WMD\\". As a US Army NBC (nuclear, biological, chemical) school graduate, I can tell you that a WMD is any weapon - nuclear, biological, or chemical - that, if delivered by the proper delivery system, can or will cause massive casualties. So, if our hollywood leftists had any knowledge or critical thinking capabilities, they would not be so cynical of the claims of WMDs made by many governments. Why? Simple...because in the 1980s Iran - Iraq war, Saddam used chemical weapons (WMDs) against the Iranians. After the first Gulf war (Desert Storm), Saddam again used chemical weapons (WMDs) against his OWN people - the Kurds in northern Iraq. There is little dispute about these events, there's too much evidence for even Saddam to deny with a straight face. So, with his history of actually using WMDs, why does Hollywood find it so hard to believe? I think it's because they don't understand that chemical weapons ARE WMDs. I don't say any of this because I want to defend the US Government; I still think most of what we did was wrong, and I friggin' hate G.W. Bush the Idiot...I'm a Libertarian, not a liberal democrat nor a conservative Republican.<br /><br />As far as the movie itself, the acting was excellent all around. Damon was incredible. Kinnear was surprisingly good, though I hated his character. I just think hollywood would serve us better if they spent more energy trying to create entertainment without injecting their biased and factually incorrect ideology into everything.

B002BU0DPE|5.0|These headphones are a must have for any serious gamer, and I mean a must have. It's a necessity. This is such a great quality product. Lightweight but durable. Works well with my PS3. I destroy in Hardcore Search and Destroy with these things. I get about 10-15 kills average with these things on. You can hear everything with these on, and I mean everything. You hear people walking, setting up claymores, planting bombs, reloading, etc. Works better with Search and destory than team deathmatch because in td the sound and bass just go off the roof. Still, these things are beasty and really a necessity if you even consider yourself a gamer.

0439023483|5.0|My 11 year old daughter had been pestering me for months to read Hunger Games. Since most of her books are young adult magical fantasies I resisted. When I finally picked it up I couldn't put it down.    The marks of a good book in my mind are: does it make you think? Do the characters seem like real people? Would you read it again? Can you put it down to eat? The Hunger Games struck me hard on all of these points.    Katniss seems like a real heroine. She is a survivor, she's had to be. This has left her scarred and somewhat withdrawn emotionally. She doesn't really trust anyone but her sister Prim and her hunting partner Gale. At 16 she is still completely oblivious to romance but is sure that she will never get married nor have children that may be forced to participate in the games. Her education is lacking, which explains much of the grammar as the book is written completely in first person from her point of view. This book is as much a coming out story for Katniss as anything else.    I read all three at one go and I have a desire for more that won't be satisfied. Read Hunger Games, as unless you are unusual in your tastes you will love it, and I am 47.
B003INBOEC|2.0|Basically, this is a bad period film in the guise of a martial arts film.  Has some decent fights, though there is too much wire work (although by that, i'm kinda of saying that there shouldn't be any wire work). The fights at the beginning are a lot better then the ones in the middle and end of the movie. The most interesting thing about the film is the great Fan Sui Wong is the role of the bandit Jin.  He's clearly the most interesting fighter / actor to watch in the film.  Otherwise, this movie starts out decent, but by the end of the film, you find yourself saying that the film is pretty bad.   If you're looking for a great old-scholl martial arts movie, then this ain't it.

B002QEXN2K|5.0|When I saw online the music video for \\"who says\\" I really wasn't impressed that John Mayer was making a song about getting high. It has been done before by plenty of artists, and I don't think we need another one. I pre-judged this album before purchasing it, assuming the content was going to be a product of a new attitude. John Mayer has a terrible reputation of being cocky, which one should understand we really can't trust what the press puts out about him, everything is altered. When I heard this album, the content of the lyrics were consistent with John Mayer's previous albums, showing depth into the subtle experiences of love and giving insights into the emotional experiences of hardships, breakups, and the stuff of relationships.<br /><br />Musically, I love it. He's so great at making music that just makes you want to grove. If you can get past the Who Says song, if you have any bias about getting stoned, then I think you'll enjoy this album for its authentic expression.

I saw one review stating the best album since powerslave and i must agrea it ranks in the powerslave no prayer for the dieing erea.  the songs show briliance of both older maiden and new maiden combined.

Definately the best album since no prayer for the dieing a must for die hard fans and a great choice for intersted new fans.

I didn't find the introduction of narrative by Cole and Isabel to be a problem like some people.  Overall I found the story a bit predictable and I was disappointed with the ending, but it was a great set up for Forever.
030726999X|3.0|I agree with one other reviewer....you need to read all the books in order and you need to read book 3, but book 3 was simply too long. It was if the author had died and no one wanted to clean up his work. The book could have easily been a tight 400 pages instead of a loose 600 pages. It will not effect the sales or the sale of book 4 as there will not be one. It just made me appreciate the first two in the series that much more.
0545123275|4.0|This book is GOOD.  I really enjoyed the style of writing, very descriptive.  You feel as if you live in the town and know the characters personally.  I read it in 48 hours because I couldn't put it down.  I only gave it 4 stars because I wish it were longer.
0385341008|5.0|This book brought two firsts for me: 1) This is the first book I've actually progressed from the inkling that I should write a review to actually DOING it and 2) is the first book that when I came to the absolutely delightful, joyous, making me grin from the inside out ending, that I went back to the beginning and started again. While by the end of my first reading I had the numerous characters sorted out, they were rapidly introduced, and as the reader must keep track of who they are by referring to whom the letters are to and from, I wanted to go back and reread each character's introduction. Then I found I just wanted to keep rereading to again experience the development of the relationships between these quirky and wonderful characters. Plus there were so many parts worth rereading: playing Dead Bride, marching bejeweled to Pomp and Circumstance, the character reference Juliet had her fellow Fire Warden write, John Booker's review of Seneca, the incredible comeuppance of Billee Bee, and Isola's bumbling as Miss Marple leading to the very satisfying conclusion, to name a few. I am not just recommending this book to friends, but buying four more copies to give away. Need I say more?
0802798225|3.0|This book wasn't very good.  The ending is rushed.  So many details are left out.  It concludes like a sappy after school special.  I found it hard to accept.

B000VNMMQG|5.0|It is rare to find a film so hopeful and inspirational. In today's world, where the rage is about horror, vulgarity, and brokenness; there is something spiritually uplifting about a film that breaks from the norm.<br /><br />Everything from Cinematography to Cast makes for enjoyable entertainment. I can hardly call a film of this magnitude \\"entertainment.\\" By the end, one may feel impassioned to better the world. My only complaint is that there are too few films to share good company with this one.

1416589473|4.0|I gave this book 4 stars because I'm a big fan of Guild Wars from ArenaNet and this is a must read if you are a fan.   With that said, I do not suggest it to people who have no idea what Guild Wars is about, I can imagien it must be very confusing for them.    As always Arena Net have managed to keep a clean and strong storyline, as in the game(s) there is nothing in the book that seems farfetched. The storyline from the game continues in the book.    I'm looking forward to the next book.

0060922583|5.0|For years I have watched shows like \\"Psychic Investigators\\" and \\"Psychic Kids\\", not to mention \\"Medium\\" and \\"The Ghost Whisperer\\". I was a total skeptic, but after seeing so many cops, who were also skeptics, and even some cops who were psychics, do the impossible, I had to acknowledge something unexplainable was happening. I needed a new set of scientific ideas. I felt like Pasteur discovering that yeast was a creature. I don't know if the holograph is the complete answer, but it's a start. If you have any interest in psychics at all, you must read this book. It brings together many psychic events with the best scientific evidence available to get your brain going. It's a sensible, well written book that presents what evidence there is (well annotated), in a readable, interesting easy to follow structure. It's a great jumping off point to try to figure out how people do things that they shouldn't be able to do. That used to keep me up at night scratching my head. And there is no hostility to religion here, either, which I really appreciated. I'm so tired of science and religion acting like they are mutually exclusive disciplines.

B002ZG98C8|4.0|** Couple of SPOILERS (shouldn't matter, but I warned ya) ahead **<br /><br />The fake trailer to MACHETE was probably the highlight for me of GRINDHOUSE (2007) the intermittently entertaining Robert Rodriguez/Quentin Tarantino homage to 1970s exploitation cinema. Heck, all the trailers were cool and I'm glad to have HOBO WITH A SHOTGUN (best title of all time) to look forward to as well. Kind of weird though that anything more came out of that film, which received mixed critical response and generally poor box office. Well, I'm glad that Rodriguez said damn the critics and the public and went ahead with this, because MACHETE - though not exactly a masterpiece - easily beats out either of the two original GRINDHOUSE features, and helps to show, if there were any real doubt, that though QT may talk the exploitation talk (and talk, and talk...), it's his Texan buddy who walks the walk.<br /><br />The opening could not be any better: a splatter and nudity-filled prologue to the film proper, as federale Machete (Danny Trejo channelling DEATH WISH 3-era Charles Bronson with pretty near total success) wipes out a dozen henchmen of drug kingpin Torrez (Steven Seagal), mostly with his weapon of choice but also with anything that comes in handy including an automatic with chopped-off hand still attached - but doesn't manage, at the end to save his wife from the same kind of fate that befalls most of his adversaries. Somehow he manages to escape a serious-looking cut to his groin area and the burning of the house; like a Bronson character, he doesn't need to vow revenge, we know he'll get it somehow.<br /><br />Cut to several years later, as ex-cop Machete is now earning a living as a day laborer in Texas. A far right-wing state Senator (Robert DeNiro) is in collusion with a group of Minutemen-type vigilantes led by Don Johnson, and greasy Jeff Fahey hires Machete to kill him for loads of cash, which the taciturn tough guy instead gives to Luz (Michelle Rodriguez), owner of a taco stand and....<br /><br />oh the heck with it. What's the point of going on about the plot?  A complex, involving story is not why you are watching this movie!  Suffice it to say that rough-looking, heavily tattooed and deep-voiced Machete spends most of the time cutting people up and blowing them away; we get to see him cut a guy open, pull out the intestine (a couple of minutes after a helpful lecture by a doctor) and then swing out a window with the unfortunate dude's organ as a rope; we get to see weedwhackers in action, a motorcycle-mounted gatling gun, a double-machete vs double-katana duel, a long soliloquy by a dying villain before he deliberately twists the blade imbedded in him all around his insides - you get the picture. And we get plenty of nudity and just-about, in the eye-candy form of Ms. Rodriguez, Jessica Alba, and Lindsay Lohan - among others. And a plot with some pretense of seriousness (the corruption of immigration/border issues) that is essentially jettisoned for action 75% of the time - in the best exploitation style.<br /><br />MACHETE does run out of steam a bit, though it's mostly because Rodriguez and codirector Ethan Maniquis just want to pack too much in I think - a couple too many characters (we've also got Cheech Marin as Machete's shotgun-toting priest brother, Tom Savini as a hitman hired to stop Machete, lots of comic bits involving Fahey's henchmen and a few of Machete's allies, etc) and a last act that's just too drawn out and inevitable, even if we do get some excellent death scenes out of it. The acting isn't really \\"good\\", but should you expect it to be? No, not really. Fahey really seems to get his role and seems like he could fit right in as a slimeball in a 1973 blaxploitation film with Pam Grier or Jim Kelly; Cheech is good as well though he's not onscreen enough. And Seagal plays his villainous overlord exactly the same way he plays half the cop characters he's done - with arrogance and disdain - but it seems to workbetter in this kind of role I think. I wish more had been made of the 60something, not exactly handsome Machete getting to make it with every hot babe in the film - but maybe it's just as funny that it's not overdone; after all, we're used to stuff like this in every other action movie, Trejo happens to be just a bit more obviously outside of the male model category than Sean Connery or Clint Eastwood.<br /><br />All in all, it's pretty damn fun. The tilt here is more towards action than satire, as opposed to last year's [[ASIN:B002BWP3W0 Black Dynamite]] which is drawing some comparisons. That film was one of my favorites of 2009, and though this might not make my top 10 for 2010, I'm glad there are a few people around who still know how to do something like old-school action - even if they do have to resort to parody to get it done.  Now I just need to get ahold of some Mexploitation flicks.<br /><br />Long live Danny Trejo!wish more had been made of the 60something, not exactly handsome Machete getting to make it with every hot babe in the film - but maybe it's just as funny that it's not overdone; after all, we're used to stuff like this in every other action movie, Trejo happens to be just a bit more obviously outside of the male model category than Sean Connery or Clint Eastwood.

0143118420|3.0|Four months of languae study in Rome.  Four months of yoga study in an Ashram in India.  Four months of hanging out on the beach at Bali.  Elizabeth Gilbert's journey in \\"Eat Pray Love\\" is a glorified gap year, and indeed there's something extremely juvenile and lame about the entire journey.    Don't get me wrong.  I would love to be paid by a publisher to study and gorge myself in Rome, then chill with other wealthy, enlightened expatriates in India, before just hanging out in Bali.  But if my travel companion were a manic depressive, self-obsessed, and neurotic successful writer I would very quickly need to hop on the next plane home.  This book was very hard to get through because the writer is more annoying than sympathetic, and the writing from this professional writer can sometimes be just silly and mediocre:  \\"The next morning in meditation, all my caustic old hateful thoughts come up again.  I'm starting to think of them as irritating telemarketers, always calling at the most inopportune moments.\\"      There are some honestly funny moments in the book, and because I love to eat and I practice yoga the first two-thirds of the book were bearable for me (the idea of hanging out at an island resort with a bunch of drunk expatriates had no appeal for me so I flipped through the last third), but what really sells and saves the book is that there are actually a lot of neurotic women out there (who, for whaver reason, all decide to congregate in New York) who also wish that a publisher would pay a trip around the world for them to meet beautiful Italian men, find enlightenment and transcedence in India, and fall madly in love with a Brazilian in Bali.  In other words, this book is a marketing gimmick, and it's a very annoying one at that.    Because this book is marketing gimmick, the entire journey is cheapened.  The author says that she's escaping a broken life in New York.  Yes, she's going through a messy divorce, but it's because she's decided she's bored withher husband.  Yes, she's stuck in a co-dependent relationship with a lover, but it's because she's a depressive and is looking for this sort of self-destruction.  So she says that she's going to go on a journey of self-discovery.  But it'll be one year, in three different places, will be paid by someone else, and there'll be a book at the end of the journey.  This contradicts everything she says is good, noble, and beautiful:  living for living's sake, being always present, finding comfort and beauty in the moment.  Would an Italian or an Indian or a Balinese find himself in such a lame contradiction?  Only a self-obsessed ambitious New Yorker.  Enlightenment is good, but only if it's from 5-6pm Monday to Thursday, right before spinning class.      Here's a book about a New Yorker who has everything, goes on a journey to learn that everything is nothing, and decides she wants everything and nothing at the same time.

I made it through the first story which I found inordinately depressing and then quit.  Most people seem to think that it was brilliant, so it's probably just a matter of me not being able to appreciate \\"literature\\".
B00275EHJG|5.0|Disney Pixar has never failed once in making great movies that attract parents and children of all ages in falling in love with the story and characters that Pixar movies create. Toy Story was the first movie Pixar has ever done back in 1995, and it was an instant classic. A sequel was made in 1999 that actually surpassed the original Toy Story in every aspect, in story, humor, action and acting. Toy Story 2 was one of the rare disney sequels that actually works. As said before, all Pixar movies were masterpieces (exception to the movie \\"Cars\\" which was the only pixar movie that was mediocre) and Toy Story 3 is no different.<br /><br />Toy Story 3 begins with Andy in his bedroom about to leave college thinking about where to put his beloved toys he had for years. The future of Woody, Buzz and everyone else is in jepordy when Andy doesn't know whether to put the toys in the attic or to give them away. The toys decide to donate themeselves to a Day Care in which they can be played with for many more years to come, however it doesn't go exactly how they imagined it would be. The story of Toy Story 3 is incredibly told, through all the usual humor and acting that the previous 2 movies were famous for. This movie although very funny, is much darker then its predecessors thanks to the main antagonist Lotso who makes the Toys life a living hell. The back story of Lotso the bear is actually very believable to the point where you can sort of feel his pain and sense of abandonment from his original owner. While the story is awsome, the graphics of this movie are visually impressive. You can tell right away how much the technology has improved since the previous Toy Stories were made. The texture and feel of the movie is down right scary real and you can only imgaine how it would look on Blu-Ray.<br /><br />This movie is now my new favorite pixar movie of all time and it is possibly one of the greatest animated films ever made. It is a fitting end to the Toy Story trilogy and the endinf could even make the most masculine of men break down to tears. The feeling of nostalgia  when watching this movie is incredible for the people (such as myself) who have grown up watching Toy Story. I highly recommend this film to people of all ages and even if you haven't watched the previous Toy Story movies, you can still enjoy this movie as much as the people who are familiar with the characters. Toy Story 3 FTW!!!!even make the most masculine of men break down to tears.

0439023513|3.0|Spoiler alert...<br />! Ok...I have been waiting & waiting for this book for such a long time. I read it in two days.....I still can't believe the series is over.... and in such a disappointing way! It's like having gourmet Hors d'aeuvres only to be served frozen pizza as the main course! Peeta's barely in it & when he is, he is nothing like his character in the past 2 books. Katniss is a total mess and is flat out mean to Peeta. Gale wants to kill everything & everyone. Finnick finally gets some depth only to die in five seconds with barely a backwards glance. Prim gets killed...PRIM!!!! The whole reason Katniss entered The Hunger Games was to prevent her death!!!!!!! Other characters that I wondered about were barely mentioned: Effie shows up at the end, where was she? Cinna (was obviously killed but there was no closure!), Madge & her family & of course Haymitch (we find out they killed everyone he ever loved) President Snow's death & Darius and the other Avox girl (all the other Avoxs too) Johanna & not to mention the addition of so many ''red shirt'' type of characters!!!!!!Finally we resolve the \\"love triangle\\" as what feels like an afterthought!! It felt rushed and almost like someone had \\"hijacked\\" Suzanne Collins & forced her to write the book as quickly as possible, regardless of the quality!!!
B002ZG983M|5.0|If you like action, root for the heros type of movie with lots and lots of killing then you will love this one.  The gun and weapons handling is superb. It was a little disturbing to watch a 10 year old little girl decapatate, kill and maim all the villains but in the same breath I must say that she was great.  I want a daughter just like her.  Alot of fun to watch.

B0030Y11XS|4.0|This is a harsh examination of a doctrine that has gone unchallenged and unquestioned for far too long.  The principles of Capitalism have indoctrinated every aspect of American life: from education (elementary school through college) to economic principles (virtually every economic activity) to our very way of life (our lives are driven by consumerism and prosperity).    By examining the details and real-life consequences of Capitalism, this movie puts a spotlight on how utterly ridiculous, unfair and unsustainable this doctrine is.  Capitalism inevitably leads to the concentration of power and wealth in a select few (a different group of \\"select few\\" than the royalty of medieval times or the rulers of Roman and Greek times) at the expense of the rest of humanity.

0596806027|4.0|This is a great book for developers who want a book that explains the HTML5 standard. It takes the time to explain and demonstrate the features and changes in HTML5. It also shows how you can take current code and make use of HTML5 tags. It is a very useful book to have now for HTML5 as there are only a few books on HTML5 that are as comprehensive. However, the book may seem to be dragging its feet and come across more as a reference book.     I will tell beginners to stay away from this book until you have your foundation done. This book is to get you up and running only on the HTML5 standard, not beginner HTML. You could have it sitting on your shelf while you start on a beginner HTML course.     Do not be bogged down by the first chapter on the history of HTML as it is really heavy reading. I feel that it should be placed at the back of the book as optional reading rather than an introduction chapter. Its too much history that is not needed to get you up and running on HTML5. Don't feel that you are missing out too much if you don't read into the first chapter, you can always go back some other time.
B000KX0IOA|5.0|As Gandhi's life unfolds before us, we see the single-minded grasp that he had on all of life: from the simplest parts (spinning his own clothes) to the most complex (leading millions of impoverished Indians out of the colonial bondage of a few hundred-thousand British).  He led a purposeful life that was devoted to simple truths.  This has inspired and challenged me to question my own life: What is my purpose?  What are my truths?    This movie also demonstrates the timelessness of the human condition:  power and wealth are held by a very few and varying degrees of poverty and inequity are distributed to the many ... still, this is true.
B001676320|4.0|This was a concert i was waiting to see. two Legendary bands what more do you need?
B003HLM2QO|4.0|Brand new album from the godfather of Heavy Metal, one bearing major changes since the previous studio offering `Black Rain' of 2007. From the previous line up only bass player Blasko remains as guitarist Zakk Wylde parted ways with Ozzy after a 22 year partnership while drummer Mike Bordin also exited the line up to rejoin `Faith no More'. The new drummer was found in the face of Tommy Clufetos who played with Blasko in `Rob zombie', a truly remarkable player `notorious' for outrageous live performances who does bring back the 80's big drumming. Last came in the new axeman, the latest guitar hero heavy metal has produced Gus G. (\\"Firewind\\"). I have to say that the choice of Gus G. as the new axe man was a stretch of the imagination as Ozzy's known for choosing amongst newcomer guitarists while Gus had recorded over ten albums by 2009, having served as a full time member in five bands.<br /><br />A year past the formation of this latest line-up finds Ozzy with the brand new album `Scream'. The material is arguably more diverse than on the previous album `Black Rain', the guitar leads/solos come in plenty, the drumming is much heavier/intense and Ozzy is louder than one would expect;  all under the best ever production-courtesy of Kevin Churko (being also the main songwriter of `Scream').<br /><br />It is true that while the album holds some exceptional songs in `Let it die', `Let me hear you scream', `Life won't wait' and `Diggin' me down' the rest of the material is not as consistent in terms of quality to those standout tracks. Beyond that, I feel that the `Ozzy Osbourne band' sounds as dangerous and unpredictable as it did in the early-mid 80s.<br /><br />It is probably true that \\"Scream\\" is far from a perfect release yet it is capable of engaging the listener for a good amount of time; and, if nothing else, carries a new Ozzy classic  in `Let me hear you scream'.<br /><br />\\"Classic rock\\" UK magazine (issue 147) marks this album with 8/10 commenting: \\"An album sizzling with energy and renewed vitality\\"<br /><br /> \\"Metal Hammer\\" Greek magazine (issue 307) marks this album with 8/10 commenting: \\"A meaningful, focused and powerful album\\"<br /><br />\\"Rock Hard\\" Greek magazine (issue 54) marks this album with 6,5/10 commenting: \\"Clearly superior to Down to earth and Black Rain\\"enewed vitality\\"       \\"Metal Hammer\\" Greek magazine (issue 307) marks this album with 8/10 commenting: \\"A meaningful, focused and powerful album\\"    \\"Rock Hard\\" Greek magazine (issue 54) marks this album with 6,5/10 commenting: \\"Clearly superior to Down to earth and Black Rain\\"
0553805371|5.0|The Grand Design is a short and well-written book aiming for a broad audience, with no equations, even though you might need some basic background in physics or at least be familiar with Hawking's previous popular writings to fully grasp some of the explanations, particularly those regarding relativity and quantum theory, which are essential for the book's main argument: Modern cosmology, and M-theory in particular, allows an explanation for the creation of the universe without the need for the God hypothesis, as Laplace remarkably replied to Napoleon.<br /><br />This work is not a follow-up or update of Hawking's previous popular bestsellers (from [[ASIN:055305340X A Brief History of Time]] to [[ASIN:055380202X The Universe in a Nutshell]]) , but this time he joints the group of renown scientist who recently have decided to come out of the closet to publicly argue that there is no need of God to explain the origins of the universe, and as Richard Dawkings argued in his famous 2006 book [[ASIN:0618918248 The God Delusion]], this conclusion is based on the existence of multiple or parallel universes (multiverse), created spontaneously, which allows for different laws of physics to exist in each universe, and therefore, there is nothing special about ours, we just live in an universe that has the right conditions for us to exist.<br /><br />This position is in contrast with several scientists, philosophers, theologians and laymen who have argued that the delicate fine tuning discovered in most of the fundamental constants through modern cosmology and physics points to the existence of a Grand Designer, because if these constants were slightly different, the universe and our planet in particular would not be suitable for the development of life. This interpretation has been fully explored by Paul Davies (see [[ASIN:0671797182 The Mind of God: The Scientific Basis for a Rational World]], [[ASIN:0671528068 God and the New Physics]], and [[ASIN:B003R4ZJBG Cosmic Jackpot: Why Our Universe Is Just Right for Life]] or under its new title [[ASIN:0547053584 The Goldilocks Enigma: Why Is the Universe Just Right for Life?]]), and more recently by Francis S. Collins in his 2007 book [[ASIN:1416542744 The Language of God: A Scientist Presents Evidence for Belief]]. Even Hawking himself in the final chapter of his bestseller  \\"The Brief History of Time\\" toyed with the role of God in creation. He closed the book saying that \\"...if we find the answer to that (referring to the discovery a unified Theory of Everything), it would be the ultimate triumph of human reason - for then we would know the mind of God.\\" (and this was actually the inspiration for the title of Paul Davies' 1992 book \\"The Mind of God\\"). No wonder so many people are annoyed by Hawking's latest conclusion.<br /><br />Despite the authors opening claim that philosophy is dead, the book is actually a brilliant piece of philosophy based on cosmology and the latest advances in astrophysics, as it embarks in the quest for answering the following three questions: Why is there something rather than nothing? Why do we exist? Why this particular set of laws and not some other? There is no question those interested in philosophy would be among the main audience of the book.<br /><br />Regardless if you are theist, deist, agnostic or atheist, if you have an open mind this book is a must read, and for those who already read The God Delusion and/or Victor Stenger's [[ASIN:1591026520 God: The Failed Hypothesis. How Science Shows That God Does Not Exist]], The Grand Design is the natural follow-up, as Hawking and Mlodinow built their arguments in a very detailed way, from the origins of astronomy to the complex concepts of relativity and quantum theory up to string theories, and they openly discuss the \\"fine tuning\\" interpretation as proof of God's hand in the selection of the laws of physics as opposed to the M-theory interpretation.<br /><br />My only complaint is that the authors should have been more explicit in the book regarding the limitations of  M-theory, because as some critics have pointed out, as of today it is only a mathematical construct in theoretical physics, it lacks predictive power and so far it is untestable. And also, as it happened with its predecessor string theories, it would not be surprising if contradictions or incompleteness are found in the near future, so for me the search for a Unified Theory of Everything is still wide open. I did fully enjoy this book but contrary to Mr. Hawking thesis, I still continue to share Einstein believe that God does not play dice. It is hard to accept that there were so many lucky coincidences in a row and so much created out of nothing.e been more explicit in the book regarding the limitations of  M-theory, because as some critics have pointed out, as of today it is only a mathematical construct in theoretical physics, it lacks predictive power and so far it is untestable.

0553582461|2.0|**Spoiler alert**    This amazing series was flawed by its conclusion. At the end the main character (the Fool) believes the one he loves the most (Fitz) to be dead. From this the reader will come to the conclusion that the Fool will be unhappy for the rest of his very long life. Some reward for saving the world! In the epilogue Fitz explains that he is not happy with the resolution either. Why then, dear reader, should you be expected to be happy? Also, a few important things are left unresolved. What is the significance of Others Island and what are the monsters hiding in the forest there? Also what happens to the other stone dragon on Aslevjal Island, the dragon that holds captive so many forged ones' spirits? Perhaps the author should be the one to say \\"I have never been wise\\".

B002SSUQFG|5.0|I'm not a watch geek, so I'm not even going to begin to address the technical points that other reviewers have covered. I was looking for a watch that was somewhere between casual and dressy and this watch filled the bill. If you are looking for a watch that is stylishly large (a grandfather clock on your wrist), then this is not a watch for you. I like a watch that slides easily under the cuff of a dress shirt and is not so large that it screams \\"look at me, look at me!\\". I am not a small person (6'1\\" and 215 pounds) and I find the size of this watch just about ideal. It is also dressier looking than I expected, and I have worn it with a suit and tie and have felt very comfortable. I have no problem with its accuracy - it seems to be as accurate as my Citizen Eco-Drives. As far as the clear back goes, I don't really care because it's against my wrist, and no one sees it. I am very satisfied with this purchase and will probably buy another one in a different color.

B00005JKG9|5.0|Glengarry Glen Ross is the reason I still go to movies. Despite the constant trash that is constantly and perpetually produced, Glengarry Glen Ross represents a true cinematic master piece. Based off the award winning Broadway production, this movie has it all; amazing direction, acting and writing. I will say one thing, this movie is a little long and a little slow compared to many current movies, but its content is so fulfilling and its dialog is so natural that it is well worth the 'lack of car chases'; you might not want to watch this if you're a kid, it will sail right over your head. Beautiful is what this movie is, beautiful. And Alec Baldwin, wonderful. So if you truly respect and love a great film like I do, then this is the movie for you.

B002ZG993Q|5.0|I find 'The American' a hard sell as a film. It's not an action-thriller like the trailers make it out to be, nor would I call it a character drama or art house piece. I can't see either of these audiences appreciating this film on the level it wants you to. I think that's why I like it so much, there's nothing else like it in theaters (at least not right now).<br /><br />'The American' is about cold-blooded professional \\"Jack\\" who, after being attacked in Sweden with his girlfriend (which ends violently but not the way you think) is directed by his associate to hide out in a small town in Italy. He ends up friending a priest and a prostitute and takes a job building/modifying a weapon for an assassin. Of course his old enemies catch up to him but the movie chooses more to focus on the main character's slow change from cold-professional to 'maybe' redeemable human being. There's some (very good) action and sex but the story's told in a very leisurely fashion with little dialogue. It's more about what's NOT said between and by characters that gives this movie it's weight and suspense.<br /><br />The camera work in this film is stunning, and that's a good thing. With the action and  unrevealing dialogue taking a back-seat the movies' long, beautiful shots of Italy really set the movie's mood well and gives the sense of isolation and seeming solitude for it's main character. The slow moving scenes of repetition involving the main character constructing a weapon and the brief word exchanges between the main character and another assassin (a terrific Thekla Reuten) perfectly reflects the mindset the film is in.<br /><br />George Clooney took a big risk being cast in this film. It's unconventional and will easily put off his usual fans. I can even understand his performance of such a cold-hearted character being written off as one dimensional. I can only say I found Clooney perfectly convincing the entire way through and I hope he gets the recognition he deserves. The rest of the cast is non-americans with Violante Placido a stand-out (in more ways than one) as the prostitute whom Clooney befriends and eventually seems to fall for.<br /><br />The DVD release of 'The American' looks very slick (even on my crappy tube-television) and comes with an insightful making-of that sheds light on the ideas the directors and producers put into the film. While there are some great cast interviews sadly there's not one with George Clooney. I would've loved to know his take on his character but there is some fun 'behind the camera' footage of him chatting and playing around with the rest of the crew so it's obvious he had fun making this movie.<br /><br />As I said 'The American' is not for everyone and is very much NOT the movie it's advertised as. It's a slow-moving, adult thriller that manages to be engaging and unpredictable without non-stop action and dialogue. For the right audience this film's a winner!ns with Violante Placido a stand-out (in more ways than one) as the prostitute whom Clooney befriends and eventually seems to fall for.

B00005JLD4|4.0|Rabbit-Proof Fence is the story of an aboriginal girl of mixed-racial heritage named Molly that is taken from her family by the Australian government and sent to be educated and indoctrinated into Australian society.  She is part of what is now called the stolen generation of aboriginal children that were intended to be integrated into Australian society as servants and workers.  The government's ultimate goal was to eliminate all traces of their heritage and homogenize Australian culture.  Molly leads her sister and another girl in an escape attempt over the Australian desert that spans almost a thousand miles.  This is a story about survival and extraordinary determination.    The film does a great job of portraying the characters as real people and not just stereotypes.  The antagonist, Kenneth Branagh's Mr. Neville, is shown to have great compassion for these children but is hopelessly misguided in his treatment of them.  It would have been very easy for them to cast him as a one-dimensional villain but they took great pains to show his actual motivations and intent.  The same treatment is given to the aboriginals, they are all portrayed as humans with flaws instead of perfect victims.  This film is a great example of what happens when indigenous cultures come into conflict with mainstream culture.  It shows the aboriginal people's struggle to keep their traditional way of life and culture despite the ever encroaching industrial world.
B000AYEL1A|1.0|Barbra Streisand is an Icon - very much an American Treasure - and she knows it. Her success in the Recording Industry is amazing, but her film work is much more spotty. Her best film performances have been when she has had a strong Director and a capable Leading Man, but in this film she has neither. Add to that the fact that her then-boyfriend Jon Peters serves as Executive Producer and you have a recipe for a mess - which is exactly what the third version of \\"A Star is Born\\" is. Even allowing for the dated mid 1970's production, this 145-minute film sinks into creative quicksand, painfully similar to a 1990's Lifetime movie.  Certainly \\"Evergreen\\" is one of Streisand's best-ever songs, but her attempt at a more rock-oriented image in this film is a disaster. And her choice of Kris Kristofferson as a Leading Man seems calculated to make Ms. Streisand look good. It is widely known that Elvis Presley was Streisand's first choice, but even in his twilight years of drug abuse, Presley had the good sense to turn the part down, reportedly saying that he refused to Co-Star with Streisand and her Ego, in that order. Kristofferson, who croaks his  musical numbers and parades shirtless through much of the film, looks like a bad Jim Morrison. Streisand looks ridiculous chasing after Kristofferson on his motorcycle and riding horseback in outfits that look like Stevie Nicks' rejects. She is photographed in such a way to make the most of flattering lighting and camera angles and in some scenes it appears she actually has a halo around her. And Streisand's big scenes are often laughable: the infamous \\"I hate you/I love you/I hate you/I love you\\" scene is so embarrassing that you wonder how Streisand let Pussycat Director Frank Pierson get away with it.  And the scene in the studio when she records \\"Evergreen,\\" complete with Kristofferson holding her hand and mouthing \\"I love you\\" is unconvincing and actually creepy. In a way, you feel for Streisand in such a lousy role, but given the fact that she demands such complete control over her film projects, she is actually to blame for this train wreck of a film. But alas, the Soundtrack became a huge Hit, which guaranteed the film's success.

B003EYVXXW|5.0|This movie impressed me -- It explores the conflict between science and fanaticism and takes the theme that we are all more similar than different yet our differences in perspective lead us to hate each other. There's action and violence, but unlike so many other Roman Empire films, the violence is an expression of the issues, rather than the point of the movie. Romance is present too, as unfulfilled longings that drives several characters. It's refreshing to see life in the ancient world presented with accuracy and enough detail to really feel yourself there.    It makes unobtrusive use of cgi to recreate a sense of gritty street life in ancient Alexandria and also some cosmic metaphors. My two favorites are the zoom in from space that contrasts the vast calm of cosmos with the tiny, intense conflict between the Alexandrians and the view of the dome that shows how an \\"imperfect\\" ellipse is really just a perfect circle from a different perspective.     The story is satisfying, sad, and thought provoking. Put it on your \\"must see\\" list!

Readers will see how the actions of mortgage originators, banks, rating agencies and Wall Street all contributed to the debacle.  Well worth the read.
B001IAOEXU|5.0|They work! Easy application and I have had no problems with this product. Worth the money. Now, if you abuse your controller your going to have problems, if you drop your controller (which I have not) I can see where they might pop off assuming they will just snap on again. They have certainly improved my gaming experience. Much greater control/precision of the R2/L2 buttons, very comfortable. Sony should have designed the controller like this to begin with. Use product every day and yes I would recommend.
B00127RAJY|5.0|So, I have never liked Jillian Michaels. I have issues with The Biggest Loser and how they approach weight loss. Needless to say, this review is NOT coming from a huge Jillian Michaels fan.<br /><br />However, she became my BFF this past month! I decided that my workout plan wasn't cutting it. I was kind of getting wishy-washy so after hearing all the great reviews, I decided to give the Shred a try. I have 2 days left of the Shred, but I looked at a comparison shot of myself yesterday and it inspired me to post. I've only lost about 8 pounds so far, but the changes are amazing! The toning and muscles it's created... amazing. I get so many complements and people ask how I do it. I just say, \\"Easy, the 30 Day Shred!\\" And this is coming from an obese person. If I can do it, ANYONE can! I've become more flexible, more energetic, and definitely more toned. All of the toning looks easily like a 15-20 pound loss! I amazed even myself.<br /><br />If you're looking for something that gets results, this is. It required commitment, but if you commit you DO get the results. I also follow a healthy lifestyle and incorporated yoga, walking and healthy eating.
B003KUSUG8|5.0|My daughter asked for this for her birthday. I was a little skeptical but it actually is not so bad. Some of the songs even I like at 35yr. There are a couple songs I think may be a little inappropriate for young teens. It is not terrible though.

This book ranks for me with Mandela, Gandhi and Martin Luther King in its strong and honest look at one's self.

030745455X|4.0|The story starts out hooking you into the world of a young, highly intelligent woman of whom those claiming to know her actually find out how little they really do know about this quirky, aloof heroine.<br /><br />An engaging plot with characters that keep the interest level high.
0061743526|5.0|From this story's beginning, we walk right into 1930s Southern life, visualizing the characters in this small town through the eyes of one of its children, Scout Finch, who narrates this wonderful tale.<br /><br />With her older brother Jem and their summer friend Dill, these children explore the small world within two blocks of their home, imagining and fantasizing and sometimes obsessing over a mysterious man named Albert (Boo) Radley.  The stories about him reveal a troubled young man contained in his home by his punitive father.  But long after the father's death, Boo stays out of sight.<br /><br />Meanwhile, the town begins stirring over a controversial happening--Atticus Finch, a lawyer and the father of Jem and Scout has taken on the case of defending a black man against charges that he raped a white woman.  Never mind that there is no physical evidence, nor are the \\"witnesses\\" even slightly credible.  Finch pokes holes in the prosecution's case, and Jem, Scout, and Dill, watching from the balcony, feel sure of an acquittal.<br /><br />What these children learn from this case and the subsequent aftermath is that life is often unjust. But their father tries to help them see that understanding another person can only happen when you \\"walk in his shoes.\\"<br /><br />Empathy, integrity, compassion, and yes, life's injustices--all of these are brought home to these children growing up in a Southern small town during the 30s.  When a surprising rescuer saves Jem and Scout from the evil of one bitter man, they also learn that things are not always the way they seem.<br /><br />The ending of [[ASIN:0061205699 To Kill a Mockingbird (slipcased edition)]] was just a beginning, in a sense, as Scout, our narrator, comes to understand what Atticus has been saying all along...most people are \\"nice,\\" too, \\"when you finally see them.\\"

B000TEUSJU|5.0|If you expect to be intellectually edified and historically informed after viewing Bob Guccione's film Caligula, you will be enraged upon viewing this gargantuan, Preminger-esque porn extravaganza.       Caligula (the film) has many things going for it; notably viable dialogue, largely contributed by Gore Vidal who, I believe, disowned this film once he got wind of the direction the film script was going in the hands of the producers, and wildly imaginative set pieces that are probably not too far off the mark in regards to what Rome looked like in 40 A.D.    It also boasts an impressive cast of stars who seem to have believed in the project by forcing themselves to pretend they were making a movie for Lindsay Anderson (O Lucky Man) or Stanley Kubrick (Clockwork Orange).  In fact, the ever-splendid Peter O'Toole gives a chilling, scary performance as Tiberius Caesar, Caligula's grandfather.  His dying emperor reminds me of Willem Dafoe's character in David Lynch's Wild at Heart, very dangerous and very insane.  Tiberius, like all the historical individuals in most films about Rome, is completely bogus here, but O'Toole falls into the spirit of the cartoony nature of this flick and has a grand old time going WAY over the top as he would love to have done in every movie he's made.  He is at his best in these kinds of roles, see The Ruling Class and The Lion in Winter.      The English are nothing if not mercenary in a very practical sense, so the producers of Caligula were able to entice the great John Gielgud to give them one of his programmed performances for a, no doubt, very high fee for 10 minutes of film time.  And I expect he enjoyed all the naked people running around in his scenes on the isle of Capri.  Good work if you can get it.    The historic person, Gaius Caligula, was a huge man according to the historians, who was hairy, bald and brawny.  We have quite a different impression of this man stemming from the really off-base character in I Claudius, playedby the otherwise great John Hurt, and this version here, played by a similarly wan and blonde, English, naughty choirboy type.  Malcolm MacDowell has stated that he now knew what it was like to be a whore.  Well, I expect he had a pretty good idea of that before this project, but having said that, he certainly seems to be enjoying himself enormously as this fantasy anti-hero, Caligula Caesar, who spends his days and nights fornicating with girls and fisting the boys.      Helen Mirren seems game for anything and it isn't all that surprising to see her flailing her enormous breasts about in priapic rituals in old Roma.  Mirren was always a superb actress who has shown over the years how versatile and adventurous she is when choosing roles, and she does them all brilliantly.  After Caligula was made she went on, years later, to star in Peter Greenaway's shocking, often disgusting film The Cook, the thief, his wife and her lover, finally making her way to Buckingham Palace as Queen Elizabeth II.   An amazing career when you look at her curriculum vitae.    These four stars make for engaging viewing between orgies and atrocities, which are, in themselves, interesting to watch, if you have the stomach for it.    Caligula is a movie for people who appreciate the beauty of the human body and are not averse to seeing it on display in a wide array of positions and activities.  The dialogue is not nauseatingly inane because Guccione opted to concentrate on the sex stuff so few words were needed to add on to Vidal's work.  What a con!  The man was a genius.    The film is made slightly cheesy, in an appropriate manner for a porn flick, by the use of 'classical' music by Aram Khachaturian and Serge Prokofiev, recorded in Mantovani-like ffffFrequency sound; lots of swooning violins in an indoor pool environment, sort of thing, alternating with blaring Ben Hur-like brass fanfares and bombast.    The sets, as I stated, are first class, no expense was spared on the production andis in many ways beautiful to behold.  Guccione was the Preminger porn kings.    You've been warned, but for those of you still interested, get it.
B0026P3G12|3.0|I really enjoy Susan's voice. It is lovely. However, I was a little disapointed in the contents. There appeared to be a lot of different types of songs, including ones that you usually only hear during holidays. I assume they are perhaps her favorites, and ones that she is used to singing. I would have put those together on a different album with similar music.

0316096199|5.0|I had read Alice Sebold's The Lovely Bones, years ago when it first came out, never knowing that she personally was a rape survivor.  I accidently discovered that fact while reading reviews of her books.  She is quite candid and detailed about her horrific experience in this book.  The violence she went through chilled me to the bone.  She really brought me literally into the time frame of when this all happened and how rape survivors were treated and \\"handled\\" back in \\"those days\\".  I could vividly picture all of it.  Also, complicating matters is the dynamics of her family and her relationship with her mother. What is so impressive is how strong a woman she is and what she has overcome and accomplished. I don't know that if this nightmare had happened to me back in that time period that I would have been quite as brave as she was.

0439023513|4.0|Kid yourself not, this is a series about war, politics, and the power of media - about not only the power of the people, but the responsibility of the people. More than ever, young adults need to be educated on their political responsibility. They need to be educated on how to see through the circuses, and I have a feeling that's what Collins set out to do.     One of my favorite moments of Mockingjay is when Katniss realizes she can survive without either Gale or Peeta. I want to thank Collins for adding that line. For every teenage girl growing up in the age of Edward versus Jacob, I thank her.    I also thank her for the perfect ending. It feels real and natural, sad but beautifully comforting. All too often the ending of a book feels contrived, too happy, too tidy. But Collins keeps Katniss true to herself to the end - surviving. And lest you think that word is cold, like Katniss fears when she hears herself described by Gale, resiliency is the trait most rewarded by nature.
B002VECMAE|4.0|This flick falls into the love it or hate it category.  Personally, I liked it alot but I recognize the scattershot nature of some of it's humor.  If I could nutshell it imagine if the Dude from the \\"Big Lebowski\\" trains a unit of psychic warriors for the military.  May sound implausible but I'll have to ask my brother who's retired from the Army's Intelligence Corps for his opinion.  In an economic running time the makers get as much out of the gag as they possibly can and leave you satisfied.  The talented cast is game and engaging and the aforementioned Jeff Bridges is a standout here.  When this came out it got a mixed reception from the critics and the reviewer from \\"Entertainment Weekly\\" gave it an F.  Maybe home video is the best place to view this flick but I would recommend this audacious film to the most ambitious cineastes.

B001GQSY5K|2.0|I, like many other Star Wars faithful went and saw this movie in the theater.  At first it seems ok, it not slightly interesting.  Mid way thru you realize you are watching a vehicle for something else.  The story is uninteresting and the climax is anti without resolve.  I left the theater wondering whyt he hell I just paid to watch a short story with no revealations.  It was in truth a intro to the Cartoon Network series which you can pick any episode and expand it to create this movie.  Simply its just an episode and not really a movie.  It just takes a long time to watch.  The animation is substandard.  Worth buying to add to the collection...nothing more.  Series is better.
0312370849|5.0|This is a fascinating book.  I could not put it down.  There are several suspense filled happenings.  You are just as involved in the search for Sarah as the author.  In the face of horror, a little girl preservered.  This is an easy read of a deep subject. Excellent book, a must read.
0060557818|1.0|After two weeks I cannot stop thinking about how disappointed I was with \\"Neverwhere\\".<br />I am honestly mystified by how this book is so highly reviewed and popular.<br />I can understand two audiences enjoying this book:  people who live in or around London, or children of the age 12 and under.  If you live in London, of course it would probably be neat to read about a sort of Twilight Zone version of the various places in the city you've seen or traveled through.  Charming, I suppose.  If you're a child, then just about any fiction could be a magical journey, no matter how badly the plot is developed or how flimsy the characters are.<br />However, if you are an adult who has read any mainstream fantasy fiction authors, I strongly recommend you avoid this book.  The characters have no depth, the parallel London universe has no real consistency or apparent framework or bounds to its magic.  Characters will suddenly posses the power or ability to accomplish something, and then after that plot device is used, the power or ability is never explained or addressed again.  Personally, and I think many other avid sci-fi & fantasy fans will agree, a fictional universe is much more satisfying when there seems to be some logic or rules that define how the magic works, and what is possible and what is not.  This author does nothing to define the scope of his universe.<br />I never saw the original TV series so perhaps I don't have a bias that some of the more generous reviewers here have.  I cannot recommend this book to anyone.  I regret buying it.<br />I don't know exactly how I would classify this Gaiman book: fantasy adventure or parallel worlds or dark fantasy.  I am not sure because the novel is just so marginal in each resepect. However, if you enjoy fantasy adventure, I recommend: Sara Douglass, R A Salvatore, Raymond E Feist, Patrick Rothfuss, Elizabeth Haydon.<br />If you like dark fantasy, or more gritty, grown up fantasy, I recommend:  George R R Martin, Jacqueline Carey, Joe Abercrombie.<br />If you like any of the above authors' work, you probably will be disappointed with Gaiman's Neverwhere.ne Carey, Joe Abercrombie.<br />If you like any of the above authors' work, you probably will be disappointed with Gaiman's Neverwhere.
B001GZ6QC4|2.0|Let me start off by saying that I was not impressed by the dullness of Batman Begins. The Dark Knight, despite it's deperate attempt to have meaning, come off as far too self-important. The only thing has seemed to improve between the two films is the action and the characterizations still remain limp.    The opening action sequence reflects this workman-like character of the Joker. What is a fine opening for a Micheal Mann action thriller, and bearing very simular photography, just reflects the films un-remarkable nature. The Joker, Batman's greatest foe because he is the antithesis of rational thought in all aspects of life, is a very conservative terrorist for \\"chaos\\" in Nolan's interpretation. Going back to this bank heist, he murders his accomplises by having them kill each-other or shooting them personally. This is a very efficient villian but not the Joker. His murders like these thugs and liquidating the mob's power with deceit and explosives is boring for such an off-the-wall maniac who's most famous episodes in comic books included selling poisoned fish and running for Govenor. Joker spouts his prententious messages constantly as the bringer of chaos but in a not so chaotic matter. He seems to be operating for the sake of nothing in this film, it's not chaos but more like who he dosen't want to see running Gotham. Joker claims Batman completes him but there interaction in this film is almost nil. They have a few breif personal, and painful, encounters but why would Joker be fascinated by Batman in particular ? True he did foil of his encounters at one point but it was a loud, noisy, chase, through-out the streets of Gotham, the intimacy wasn't present; Cleary the writers took advantage of the fact that Batman and The Joker have been enemies in the comics for decades so why bother to establish their relationship.     Another thing is Joker seems none too interested in being a serial killer or even a public harm. He scares them and kills one civilian dressedup as Batman but it all relates to the forces between \\"good\\" and \\"evil\\", it's not the common man. The finale was the only time he was after people but he still came off as a common and un-remarkable terrorist and more of the writer's desperate attempt to hammer in post-9/11 themes; We all know people can be sick and cruel, etc. so to try and sell this tripe to an audience of living adults is fruitless. The Joker should have committed, real random acts of crime for the sake of his own pleasure, a perverted \\"clown\\" who decided that has his fun with the public and the Batman. Heath Ledger comes off as a living, breathing, psycho and a feeling uncomfort does crawl on one's skin but his part is written so un-remarkably; A fine preformance that derserved better writing.    The secound villian introduced here is Harvey Dent who becomes the villian Two-Face at the climax of the film. He is pratically a non-entity in this film who, like everyone else in this film, LOVES spouting the obvious like \\"You thought we could be decent men in an indecent time. But you were wrong. The world is cruel, and the only morality in a cruel world is chance.\\"Haven't we had enough of that from The Joker who also was hammering that theme already ? As the crusading DA he is as robotic as the Bale Batman, not too concerned about being torn between his loved ones and just out for justice. Hollywood needs to see that just because a handsome man is with a beautiful woman, that is enough to call it a \\"relationship\\". I also can't believe how he evolved during the course of this film. Sure there was foreshadowing to his turn to evil by privately interrogating and nearly killing a man but why would he attack Batman and Gordon ? His beef was with the mob. Yes, I know it's all about how he blamed himself and others but that dosen't make much sense when he believed it was Sal Maroni who maimed him and killed Rachel Dawes.   I would liked to have seen Dent transform much earlier in the film so he could attack the mobsters without consequence; The role the writers decided, incorrectly, the Joker should occupy.    There is not much to cover with Dawes or Alfred. I mean they really layed on the prentention for both of them. Everytime Alfred speaks it's only something corny about Batman doing good in the world even when, I think, he was suppose to be consuling Bruce Wayne when Harvey Dent is killed and Rachel Dawes died. Dawes herself is still just a talking head but now shes conflicted between having Harvey or Bruce and I can't say I have any sypathy when these characters are so robotic.    Overall, the film improves on the action which was pretty badly done in the previous Nolan effort. However Batman himself is just as bland and brooding as ever, scarficing himself at the end but not for much reason. It's clear how much this film borrows from Jeph Loeb's brilliant graphic novels The Long Holloween and Dark Victory but they got everything mixed up for this film. It was Dent who should have been the main villian and Joker his accomplice who should have eventually fractured him, that would have been perfect. Above all, the ending was idiotic. Batman was suppose to be the symbol of Gotham's hope. True he seems a bit more human here trying to possibly retire from the role as Gotham's savior and have Harvey Dent as DA taking the responsibility. However, Dent became a killer and died and now the Batman must scarifice himself to look like a villian ? A dead matyr can only last for so long so essentially Batman's actions at the conclusion of this film were obtuse. A fine action film with some spectacular stunts, some of the most creative years, but a very shallow film that tries to be a lot more than it is.
B000065AU2|3.0|1986 would be known for two trends in hard rock music. Thrash metal would hit the mainstream as Metallica and Slayer would release two of the classics of the genre, Master of Puppets and Reign in Blood, respectively. Megadeth would also breakthrough with their excellent release, Peace Sells...But Who's Buying. It would also be the year where European metal bands really started to streamline their sound to find success in America. This was often met with disappointing results as evidenced by Judas Priest's poppy and mediocre Turbo release and Saxon's weak Rock the Nations album. Accept would follow a somewhat similar path with Russian Roulette.  They tried to keep their heavy sound while softening things up a bit on a few songs. The result revealed a once strong band that had passed their creative peak. The quasi-thrash of &#34;T.V. War&#34;, the galloping &#34;Another Second To Be&#34;, the melodic &#34;Man Enough To Cry&#34;, and the title track were all good but not great. &#34;It's Hard to Find A Way&#34; was an attempt at the big power ballad and while the song isn't bad, it's just not Accept. Further tracks like &#34;Monsterman&#34;, &#34;Aiming High&#34;, and the Balls to the Wall rewrite &#34;Heaven is Hell&#34; all leave the same feeling; they've done songs like these before but better. After this album, Udo Dirkschneider would leave the band and while the original lineup would reunite in the `90s, their early to mid-80's magic never quite returned. Well, until Blood of the Nations that is.

B002ZG996I|3.0|Every contemporary actor has to do at least one of these formula predictable comedies.  These movies are Hollywood machine cranked out of the factory to placate the proletariat. Keep people happy, keep the economy going, and distract us with the same formulas. I am one of those people that do not mind watching these movies yet I think of how many hours were wasted saying \\"stay in the car\\" or \\"don't do that\\". It is possible that, someone familiar with that sort of the genre may be able to discern between a three-star in a five-star version depending on the type of acting in the subtleness of the story. However, for me this just looks like another of a long chain the situation comedies with boy and girl misunderstanding each other until they understand each other and would have been better off misunderstanding each other.<br /><br />However, sit back and enjoy the twists and turns as Stan and Zoe (Alex O'Loughlin and Jennifer Lopez) anticipate and observe parenthood.<br /><br />The background is sound is more like a musical review:<br />\\"Bottles\\"<br />\\"A Beautiful Day\\"<br />\\"Chrystal Rain\\"<br />\\"Disco Lies\\"<br />\\"Say Hay (I Love You)\\"<br />\\"You Me & The Bourgeoisie\\"<br />\\"Let's Finish (Sinden Remax)\\"<br />\\"Fallin' For You\\"<br />\\"Key to My Heart\\"<br />\\"Daisy Belle\\"<br />\\"Golden Slippers\\"<br />\\"Mool Mantra\\"<br />\\"Crabuckit\\"<br />\\"Sweet Calypso Woman\\"<br />\\"Pizzicato Waltz From Sylvie\\"<br />\\"Trumpet Voluntary\\"<br />\\"What a Wonderful World\\"<br />\\"She Drives Me Crazy\\"<br />\\"What is Love?\\"<br /><br />I have only seen the Blu-ray version of this presentation so I cannot comment o others.

B001V7UXG2|5.0|PG Wodehouse is a great writer with vivid prose. This film adaptation of some of the adventures of Bertie Wooster and his superb valet Jeeves is fairly faithful to the books. Stephen Fry and Hugh Laurie expertly portray Jeeves and Wooster. Because this was a TV series, the female roles are covered by a wide variety of actresses, some better than others.
B003405MF6|4.0|Great easy listening - very thoughtfully done, and there's no doubt of Beck's guitar mastery;  Orchestra addition not overly done, but female vocalists are a bit much and distract from the overall message.  Would have preferred a full instrumental album.
B002N5N5LG|5.0|I adore this show. I originally started watching it because of Joel Mchale. But once I kept watching it, I fell in love with the whole thing. It's smart, witty, and endearing show. The entire cast is amazing. Modern Warfare (paintball episode)is classic.  It's a shame that this show doesn't get the recognition it deserves, but if you watch you will not be sorry. The special features on the DVD sound awesome! Cast commentaries on every episode?! Bloopers will be hilarious.
B003J27WFW|5.0|This documentary provides rare views into the personalities and interaction of Alex Lifeson, Geddy Lee and Neil Peart, while giving the viewer a unique perspective of the making of a 70's rock and roll band and the evolution that has made RUSH! such a success and joy for fans nearly 40 years later.  I'm a dedicated RUSH! fan since first hearing \\"2112\\" blister my ears while working in a record store.  Every new album is much anticipated, and never dissappointing.  However, I'm not insanely fanatic - about anyone (unlike some of the fans interviewed in the film who hit multiple shows each tour).  I'd have to say the RUSH! has been my favorite band because they are always there, always intriguingly creative and fresh.  I've always had a connection with them and felt that they were MY band.  This film showed me that I'm not the only fan that feels this way.  It is definately a film for all RUSH! fans, but most importantly it is a film for all Rock and Roll fans from the 70's - this will take you back to argueably one of the most dominant eras in Rock and Roll history.  Rock on guys, eh!!!

B0018PH3L0|5.0|First we saw a collection of photographs of the principal actors and scenes from the miniseries at a museum in Fort Worth, than the long article in Texas Monthly.  A wave of nostalgia prompted us to order the 2-disc set.  What pure enjoyment to see Larry McMurtry's novel portrayed in such epic proportions.  Robert Duval's Augustus McCrae and Tommy Lee Jones' Captain Woodrow McCall are true tour de force performances.  The supporting cast were amazing as well.  The young Diane Lane is a case in point.  Now a mature woman some 25 years later, one could see her potential in her appealing portrayal of the young prostitute who ignited such passions.  The tender affection and immense respect between Gus and Woodrow were subtly revealed as the series unfolded.  We're looking forward to viewing it a again year after year.
030745455X|5.0|Difficult the first 100 pages as the author sets up the family tree and not being familiar with Swedish names, it was hard to keep the characters straight initially, but the diagram of the family tree in the front of the book helped.  Once that all got in place the book moved along rapidly even though written in great detail.  Immediately started the second one in the series after finishing this one.  Highly recommend this book.

I enjoyed this very well written novel immensely.
0143105566|4.0|This is one of Graham Greene's later books, and though some of the elements now seem dated (apartheid, the Cold War), the essence of the story is timeless because it concerns human foibles and emotions. Other reviewers have commented on the \\"anti-hero\\" spy--which was perfected by John Le Carre in the character of George Smiley, but  Greene's Castle surely comes close (and may even be \\"better\\"). I first read this book in the late 1970s/early 1980s, and in rediscovering it recently, was struck by the timelessness of the story. The main characters are wonderfully fleshed out and the sheer amateurishness of the British security service is at once charming and appalling. A wonderful read to (re)discover.
B002ZG997M|5.0|I liked the movie a lot great actors, story and everything I would watch it again.

B00009W0U4|4.0|Dark, nasty, dirty and at times very hard to watch. However, inside the nightmare that runs through the movie is a theme that we can all relate to: How did we get where we are and if you could do it over would we?<br /><br /> The acting is top notch, even if you have to read some sub-titles. I have never found subtitles to be distracting, but if they were it is hard to pull your eyes from the screen. Even when you should because what you are seeing is one of the most heinous acts on film that I have ever seen, you simply can not. Irreversible draws you in from the very first scene, or the last scene if you want to be cute.<br /><br />  From a film making aspect there is nothing else like Irreversible;a  film that runs backwards. Saying it and reading about it is one thing, but to get the full affect you have to watch the movie. It's not like Quentin Tarantino's played out \\"Let's jumble the movie scenes around.\\" The director,Gaspar No&eacute;, had a reason to show the film backwards. This is not to say that Tarantino didn't when he shot Reservoir Dogs and Pulp Fiction chop suey style. However, Tarantino has gone to that well one to many times and it has just gotten old over time. By showing the film backwards No&eacute; has given a bow to the title, but the themes are stressed even more than if he had shot a straight, chronological movie. A straight forward movie would not have had the same impact on the viewer. As it, you can't help to be a little shaken at the end of the film. It definitely stays with you.<br /><br />  Over all, it's brilliant film making. One watching is probably enough for anyone.

B002N5N5M0|5.0|I watched the previous three seasons on dvd and am now totally hooked on the show. The fourth season is the best season so far. I wasn't a big fan of the romance arcs, but the main story lines were so thrilling that I was able to overlook that. Jonn Lithgow's character was brilliant. If you are a fan of Dexter, I strongly recommend this dvd.
B00000DUE7|4.0|I love the Disk title \\" Salve Regina / Cantatas & Motets \\"by James Bowman.  So I bought these Disks.  It's very nice number of 6 , because STABAT MATER is wonderful.  and this is nice price at US amazon, because US$150 in Japan!
0321525655|5.0|The author provides good, applicable information. He quotes other authors in the field liberally. I highly recommend this book.<br /><br />On the downside, the design of the book seemed strange. Some slides were shown quite small and in a zig-zag order that I found tough to follow. He might have been better to leave some out and enlarge the rest.
B001NLL93W|5.0|this book is a great ending to the series. I love this book series because it has so many layers, it is oneof my favorite books
B002VPE1AW|5.0|Not since Silent Running with Bruce Dern has my environmental activist side been so inspired by a science fiction film, I highly recommend this to anyone who loves the Earth and would enjoy a film that implies how destructive mankind has become to its \\"Mother\\" and is encouraged to protect our environment and climate.
0385737955|5.0|This is a kind of alternate reality \\"Lord of the Flies,\\" containing the much more hopeful idea that if you put a bunch of boys on a deserted island who had been selected for their intelligence, that they would create a single goal-oriented mutually supportive community rather than a group of killers.  This is great dystopian science-fiction but the idea that there would be a technological basis to establish this community given the assertions about the surrounding environment is unbelievable.  The best I can hope for is that the sequel will contain a twist that will explain things.

B003LXM1RS|3.0|Night Work is, in my opinion, the least good of Scissor Sisters´ albums so far. The best was Ta-Dah! and the second best was their eponymously titled first album. Unfortunately there was not a single track on Night Work which had as much \\"swing\\" as the fantastic I Don´t Feel Like Dancin´. I would say that Night Work is good, but not great.
0380977788|5.0|Wow. This book will stay with you. I loved the movie, but the book is quite different, and in a good way. Really spooked me, and that doesn't happen very often. I loved this book and will be reading it again and again.  Children take warning, though. It is pretty frightening and will likely scare kids. Adults however are sure to love it....if you love a good scare!
B00140PK6O|5.0|I really enjoyed the BBC series [[ASIN:B000AYEIWC Upstairs, Downstairs - Collector's Edition Megaset (The Complete Series plus Thomas and Sarah)]] and was looking for something similar to carry on my \\"life\\" among delightful families of characters.  I found this series while browsing and decided to try it.  While Upstairs Downstairs lives are conducted against a background of early 20th century transitions, including class discord, woman's rights, World War I and technological changes like the radio, telephone, automobile, and weapons of mass destruction, those of the Cranford characters are lived against one of equal change and social disruption.<br /><br />Here again massive differences in the well being of the different social classes, the acceptable behavior of women, the introduction of new techniques in medicine, the introduction of mass transport in the form of the railroads, all challenge the status quo, making the everyday events of the lives of these characters--at least from our own perspective--a drama of considerable proportion.  The fact that every generation, including our own, is faced with such changes allows us to understand the sense of threat felt by the elders in the series and the sense of expectation and hope felt by the younger people.<br /><br />That the fear of the older generation is not necessarily justified as much as they think it is is also apparent, as again it is in Upstairs Downstairs, with each episode.  Just as is the unwarranted expectation by the younger members of society that change will necessarily improve everything.  The episodes show us, in fact, that the more things change, the more they stay the same.  Mostly it's just the technology that changes.  This is an important bit of knowledge for us and should moderate our own expectations, as we rush into an even more technology driven age in the 21st century and to globalization.<br /><br />For those to whom this type of fiction is unfamiliar, the period is roughly that of the American Civil War in the United States and midway through the long Reign of Queen Victoria in England.  The elderly ladies would have been the Miss Dashwoods ([[ASIN:1440469563 Sense And Sensibility]][[ASIN:0800141660 Sense & Sensibility (Special Edition)]]) and Miss Bennets ([[ASIN:1453693319 Pride And Prejudice]] and [[ASIN:B00005MP58 Pride and Prejudice - The Special Edition (A&E, 1996)]]), those of Jane Austin's pen, in their own neighborhood in earlier days and whose fortunes had landed them in the various social and financial positions we find them at the beginning of the series.  Society, just as in earlier times, rigidly enforces its expectations and no one is left untouched by it.  The elder generation especially, having paid its dues, perpetuates and enforces the code with ferocity. Lady Ludlow angrily refuses a lower class girl looking to enter her service for being educated \\"above her station\\" and insists that these orders of society need no education because it gives them \\"dangerous ideas\\" and results in the violence of the French revolution.  Just as assuredly that change is in the air is reflected by the activities and attitudes of her land agent Edmund Carter who encourages the boy Harry Greigson, who has become the defacto head of his houseold by virtue of an inconstant father.<br /><br />The cinematography of the work is lovely, as it usually is in a BBC series.  The village and the housing in it are very realistically presented and thematically evocative.  The character of each home clearly reflects the social status and financial wherewithal of the people living in them. There is no doubt, for instance, that the widowed doctor's wife has enjoyed some degree of comfort and social standing in the past, but that she has fallen on hard times since her husband died.  The walls are dark with peeling paint, the woodwork is also in need of repair, and little of the gracious life is left except a few pieces of good furniture looking marooned in the large rooms.  The presence of affluence but the absence of a woman's influence, reflected in the fine house and furnishings with noticeable dust of farmer Thomas Holbrook, tells of an elderly bachelor whose disappointment in love left him with nothing but money to keep him company.  The respectable, well kept household of the Jenkyns sisters reflects their status as spinsters left with the last of a family's fortune and their own respectable characters with which to live out their lives.  While the meager lodgings of Captain Brown and his family reveals their status of dependency on the good will of Major Gordon.<br /><br />The costumes are quite intriguing.  Unlike the more loosely fitting and occasionally provocative empire-waist dresses of the earlier part of the century enjoyed by the Jane Austin characters--and Empress Josephine--the gowns of the period are more confining, figure disguising, and \\"proper.\\"  Their yards and yards of material mean that few but the more affluent can afford them--thus making a less financially well endowed individual more conspicuous and avoidable in the marriage market.  More importantly they reflect a society less sure of itself and more inclined to harken back to the grandure of the 18th century than to the youthful enthusiasm of the earlier part of the 19th.<br /><br />Though the series is definitely a drama, it has frequent comedic events that are quite funny.  The social climbing Mrs. Jameison in her little sedan chair being run about by over worked footmen in pursuit of the most recent gossip is quite amusing as is the outrageous tale of \\"the fate of the vintage lace.\\"  Although she drops out early in the series, my favorite character is Deborah Jenkyns, played with great skill by Eileen Atkins.  She is a wonderful blend of rigidly upright elder with a heart of gold and a will of iron.  Her sister Matilda, played by Judi Dench, has less to say for herself until almost half way through the first series, when it becomes apparent that she, like the younger character of Miss Brown, had given up her chance of happiness in marriage out of a sense of duty to her family.  The d&eacute;nouement of the final act of her lovestory, while very predictable, was none the less poignant in its impact and very meaningful in the context of Miss Brown's more recent and ill-considered sacrifice.  The viewer is left in no doubt as to the likely fate of Miss Brown.<br /><br />A lovely series.luence but the absence of a woman's influence, reflected in the fine house and furnishings with noticeable dust of farmer Thomas Holbrook, tells of an elderly bachelor whose disappointment in love left him with nothing but money to keep him company.

0439023513|3.0|Where do I even begin with Mockingjay? I have to say I was pretty disappointed in this book. The first half of the book is really great; but then it goes downhill, fast. This book has a much different approach than the other books, and the characters that you have learned to love slip away before your eyes. I feel like the 2nd half of this book and especially the ending don't do justice to what was built up in the first two books. The plots set up in the first two books are totally epic and awesome: then, there's the ending which seems like it was thrown together really fast and is pretty flat. Don't even get me started on the characters. So much work has gone into developing them, yet towards the end it just kind of goes out the window and in the end you're told how they end up without any of the details or information you want to know from reading the other books. The ending just seems kind thrown-together. Also very depressing. But, I do have to give it credit that it at least ends the series and answers most questions; just not in the way you would imagine from the first two books. Almost seems like a waste of how beautiful and great the first two books are.
B0038QGXHW|5.0|this is a stunning, easy album, Charlie has calmed the waters and the result is like sitting an a cozy piano bar at closing in the 60's.  I wish they had continued together all these years...   buy it, you won't be disappointed....
B000FC11JW|5.0|This book is a must read for anyone looking to take their career and/or organization to the next level.  Peter Drucker clearly and concisely walks you through how to turn management and leadership theory into practice.  Whether you are looking to structure your management, or fine-tune your management style, this book will help produce results.  It is a book that can be read over and over with different lessons coming each time.

B0039TD7PY|5.0|This recording is fantastic, especially for us aging baby boomers who started listening to James Taylor and Carol King since we were in junior high.  It is also incredible to see people in their late 60's rocking it out, and if anything, both voices are stronger than ever.  Highly recommended.
B001ECQ6YW|5.0|A funny tale of misfit adventure showing Po who is torn between the family responsibility of doing the right thing by his adopted father who owns a meager noodle shop and his dream of wanting to be a real Kung Fu warrior.

B003EYVXTQ|5.0|This is the best movie I've seen this year. I love independent films, and this ranks among the best in terms of writing and acting.  An unexpected, suspense-filled movie although one may not acknowledge it until the movie ends.  Who knew rural kinfolk could be so cruel, yet kind at the same time.  It comes down to the law of the land and customs.  When a father disappears, his eldest daughter risks all to find him and keep the family together.  Hard to forget this movie, unlike so many others that outsold it by multiples.  Grab the dvd upon release.
B003LL3NOK|4.0|I have watched all of the dead movies so far and this is the only one that truly kept me interested through the whole thing.  Granted I was young when I first became attracted to the Dead series and the blood and gore left little to the imagination. I am impressed with the storyline of this one.
B003ITZBVI|5.0|Five years ago, The Joker (Voiced by John Dimaggio) left Batman's second Robin known as Jason to die. Now a new avenger has come to town named Red-Hood (Voiced by Jensen Ackles) that has been killing off criminals and thugs in various ways, Batman (Voiced by Bruce Greenwood) needs the aid of the first boy-wonder turned solo hero named Nightwing (Neil Patrick Harris) to help find out who is this mysterious killer before he kills BlackMask (Voiced by Wade Williams) and Joker.<br /><br />An excellent Batman story inspired by \\"Death in The Family\\", this is the best Batman animated movie since \\"Mask of the Phantasm\\". The animation in this movie is just flawless that merges some CGI mainly for the batmobile and good old fashioned traditonal 2D animation with excellent voice acting by an talented cast even by Kelly Hu. The film is surprisingly violent for a Batman animated movie but still can be viewed by older kids and adults alike even by fans of Batman such as myself who's always been a Batman fan since i was a kid, i also like how it has surprise appearences by Riddler and Ra's Al Ghul (Jason Issacs) to make the fans happy. I must say that DC animation has done it again!<br /><br />This Blu-Ray gives viewers flawless picture and sound perfection like ever plus Blu-Ray exclusive such as Robin's Requiem: The Tale of Jason Todd feature with the usual features like featurette, an amusing short based on Jonah Hex, a sneek previe at Superman/Batman Apocalypse coming this fall, trailers and 4 episodes of Batman the animated series.
B002VPE1AW|5.0|The two main characters are well chiseled into their own lives and thrust upon one another purely by accident. In the circle of life shown in this movie we see how the Navi care for Gaia or Mother Earth and this love dwells within their hearts and how they try to share this Sacred knowledge with outsiders only to find their homes destroyed by the greed of environmental progress. I loved it so much I want to be a Navi for Halloween this year!
0439023513|1.0|Mockingjay was a terrible dissappointment for me!  I found it necessary to force myself to continue reading it.  I loved the first two books and was anticipating this final one with great eagerness. What happened?!
B000AL5OZK|5.0|This album, being the first she released out of ABBA, is a good album. Although, in my personal opinion, not as good as \\"Eyes of a woman\\" or \\"I stand alone\\" the album has several good songs like \\"Once burned, twice shy\\", \\"Stand by my side\\" or both versions of \\"Never again/Ya nunca más\\". But it is my personal opinion. To resume, is highly recommended to those who liked Agnetha voice.
B0036EH3WK|5.0|I only have two questions, are there french subtitles on every seasons and are the blu-rays Zoned (can be watched only on the US)... thanks for an answer...
B002ZG98C8|3.0|There's no question that Robert Rodriguez's MACHETE is a lot of \\"guilty pleasure\\" fun.  There's a visceral pleasure to be had from a guy as outstandingly scary looking as Danny Trejo wielding a machete and severing heads and limbs, disemboweling bad guys and general leaving a trail of carnage in his wake.      All of these things were promised in the fake trailer for MACHETE which was presented prior to the start of GRINDHOUSE, the wonderfully crazy experience crafted by Rodriguez and his buddy, Quentin Tarantino.  Both men are drawn to the cheap thrill, to the idea of going just a little too far and over-the-top.  But Tarantino (PULP FICTION, KILL BILL, etc.) is extremely talented, a full tool box of skills at his disposal.  Rodriguez, on the other hand, mostly wields a hammer.  It's a stylish hammer, to be sure (see DESPERADO)...but his films don't feel like cheap and tawdry thrills delivered by a mad genius...they feel like exploitation flicks.  Often very fun...but also empty.    Trejo plays the titular Machete (a Mexican federale in hiding in the US after his family is slaughtered by a horrible drug kingpin, played by Steven Seagal) with about two expressions.  He's a wonder to look at and has a crazy charisma.  He's not much of an actor, but he's riveting nonetheless.  His scarred and pock-marked face is real, and he carries himself like a guy who earned those scars.  Thank goodness he IS so much fun to watch, because if his role were a failure, there would be little else to enjoy.  Machete is drawn back into the spotlight when he's framed by Jeff Fahey in an assassination attempt upon Robert DeNiro, who plays a Texas state senator who campaigns purely on the idea of driving out illegal immigrants and then putting up an electrified fence.  You will not be surprised to know that Fahey, DeNiro and Don Johnson as a border vigilante, are all actually teaming up with Seagal to control the flow of illegals, and to profit from their misery.    Machete is joined in his quest for vengeance by an immigration officer (Jessica Alba, once again proving unable to create a remotely believable portrayal of a human being), his brother who is also a priest (Cheech Marin, earning solid but obvious laughs) and a tough underground immigration supporter (Michele Rodriguez...looking mightily convincing wielding weapons).  Mayhem ensues, all of it bloody and noisy.  The film is gleefully violent, and usually only takes a break from the violence for some gratuitous nudity.  Lindsey Lohan shows up as Fahey's drugged-out daughter, and we get some body double nudity from her, in case you're interested.      The movie is pretty much what you'd expect.  The audience of mostly younger men and their seemingly reluctant dates (those who had dates) whooped and hollered and had a great time.  For myself, I kept wishing for wit that was a bit funnier, for visual flair that was more dazzling.  Rodriguez stages plenty of violence, but much of it is surprisingly clumsy and unclever.  In one scene, he takes a long close-up of a corkscrew.  Why?  So that you remember it when two scenes later, it is plunging into the eye socket of a bad guy.  The foreshadowing of weapons of destruction is this obvious throughout.  And the best action sequences occur in the prologue and in a relatively early scene in a hospital, where Machete uses a truly unusual method of escape.  As the film wears on, the scenes get bigger but they become less satisfying.    And imagine, if you will, 66 year old Trejo taking on a bloated and barely ambulatory Seagal in a climactic scene.  Yep, it was about as climactic as packing a lunch in the morning.  Tarantino is a master of finding great old stars and reinvigorating them in his masterpieces of mayhem (David Carradine in KILL BILL, Robert Forster in JACKIE BROWN).  Rodriguez seemingly wants to do the same with Seagal, but Steven Seagal was never a good actor even in his heyday.  DeNiro has minor amounts of fun in his role...but even the thrill of seeing him in such junk wears thin.  Fahey is generic.  Don Johnson has a bit of fun for awhile...but as with DeNiro, the fun wears off.  Only Michelle Rodriguez makes a real impression...she looks like a girl who would take no nonsense from anyone, and would handle herself well in a gunfight.  She is suitable support for the formidable Trejo.    I enjoyed myself for most of the film, but by the end, I had stopped laughing and smiling.  In many ways, that fake trailer from GRINDHOUSE packed all the entertainment of MACHETE into a 3 minute package.  I remembered it so fondly, and that helped me enjoy this film...but in the end, MACHETE just couldn't cut it for a feature lengthy film.
B001684L0A|5.0|Someone wrote that history is a pack of tricks we play on the dead. It doesn't apply to this production. Fascinating study of the great men who sacrificed much to found our nation.
0439023513|1.0|The first two books were amazing!  I could not wait for this one to come out so I could find out which guy Katniss would end up with.<br /><br />Sadly, this book did not touch my heart like the other two.  This one was predictable and dull.  The ending was incredibly unsatisfying.  It's as if all that I invested emotionally in the characters through the entire trilogy was wasted so that the author could preach to me about the evils of war.  While it was a technically \\"happy ending\\" there was no romance and passion in the book at all.
B002JVWR4A|5.0|Such an amazing show.   I am not a tv watcher, But I LOVE this show.  I have watched it since it started, And I have loved every episode.  Each season it gets better.

B002RI9BB2|5.0|I loved this book and its sequel, Charlie and the Great Glass Elevator, and have read them several times.  I'd like to share them with my 8-year-old nephew so tried to download them on my Kindle but apparently they are not available in the USA yet!  PLEASE add Roald Dahl to the USA Kindle Store!
0451228375|5.0|As always, Follett's story is filled with such detail one feels as if there.  The 14th century was not a pleasant century; it contained a harsh societal hierarchy, was devasted by plague which lead to economic disasters and enobling of truly unqualified individuals, as we see in Ralph for one, and people were cruel to our 21st century ethos.  The bright light of Caris and her long-time lover dim at times but is not thoroughly doused.  The writing is riviting--I cared for the main characters from the first page--and read the book straight to the end.  I had just finished \\"Timetravellers Guide to the 14th Century\\" and was in the middle of \\"A Distant Mirror\\" as I began \\"World Without End,\\" making my immersion to the times total.  I highly recommend this book for students/lovers of history.
159448385X|5.0|This is really a great book on two entirely different levels: (1) a gripping novel that will keep you turning the pages and staying up late to finish, and (2) a window into contemporary Afghanistan.  I disagree with previous reviewers who said the book left no lasting impression: it certainly did for me!  I don't think I'll soon forget the depictions of life in Afghanistan over the last half-century, especially for women.  Basically, the book follows the interrelated tales of two Afghan women from the early 1960s to the American invasion.  This book should be required reading for those involved in shaping American policy towards Afghanistan: it gives you a real feeling for daily life there and the context for all the terrible things that have happened.  Although I can't claim enough independent knowledge of Afghanistan to be able to corroborate the book's accuracy, the characters rang true to me on a human level.  Can't recommend this book highly enough.
B002ZG997C|5.0|Love this move, I watch it again yesterday for the second time I enjoyed more than the first time:)
B002ZG9846|5.0|WOW!!! what a movie at first when my son rented it a BB I told him it's a cartoon but he said I had to see it. Thank you son I was put back by what a child of ten can do. Can.t say much about it, you have to see it without knowing what it's about to understand and injoy it. I order one from Amazon as soon as I could. Must see.
B003JLA4KS|5.0|The movie is fabulous. Nice interviews with big names from the rock scene. Neil opens his heart and Alex steals the show. It also has amazing footage from the early years, including videos (yes: videos!) from Alex's and Neil's pre-Rush youth. Non-fans may also like it, since the three guys are really funny - specially when they get together. I definitely recommend it.

B003XF1XOQ|3.0|For this book, Mockingjay, one might think that it would follow the other two in that it has tons of killing, scary moments, and fake public love for the tv....not only does this book not have that....it is also kinda boring.  Well first of all whats her face became so not memorable i literally cannot remember her name and Peeta is her every other thought even after he tries to kill her.  I mean seriously if somebody tried to kill me I wouldn't forgive them.  But back to the book it was mediocre I personally thought that it should have been more like the other two and have an actual Hunger Games to it and not just talk about how some situations remind her of the Games...booorrrriinnnnggg!
B001GCUO5M|4.0|Good movie, surpring ending I enjoy it! Keep you on the want to know what would happen next.

B003O85W3A|5.0|Arcade Fire's albums just get progressively better! I first heard their music on the trailer of \\"Where the Wild Things Are\\" and i really liked the song (\\"Wake Up\\") so i bought their album that had that song (Funeral). I hadnt been much into Indie before but I really loved and appreciated the brilliance and sincerety in this album, so then I got their next album Neon Bible. This album blew my mind and i couldnt stop listening to it! It was so different from anything i'd heard, and no matter how often i hear it i never get bored. They use choirs and organs and orchestras... Awesome. It pretty much solidified them as my fav band. Now the Suburbs! Another hit! I wouldnt say it tops Neon Bible, but it definitely doesnt disappoint. I love it equally. They've gotten more refined and tighter (which i like. Their first recordings as a band were very raw and not so much to my taste). I particularly love tracks 3,9,10,13 and 15. This band is very exciting and satisfying and I highly recommend this album!
B003XU02QG|3.0|Story was trite and predictable; characters were not well developed, at least, other than a single scene in a cave where the survivors talk about their past; the action scenes were fair, but that's not saying much, is it, in an action film; if I'd paid $10 or $12, to see this in a theater I'd be pretty upset; as it is, I'm only mildly disappointed.

0439023513|4.0|Okay, I'm a Hunger Games fan... but I have to admit I'm quite sad to see it end. Now I'm scrambling to find something to fill the void.<br /><br />This book is superbly written, as are The Hunger Games and Catching Fire. The first chapters grab your interest and hold you until it finally lets you go. Not for the young one's though, much of the book has graphic violence and I would think it would frighten those under thirteen. I read through the book slowly as to savor it, but once the chase was on I couldn't put it down. I only wish the epilogue would have been a fourth book - I would have loved to learn more about the (happy?) days together and rebuilding of society.
0439023513|2.0|Given the depth of the first two books, this was a disappointing read. It lacked the character development, the meaningful interactions and mostly the opportunity to relate and bond with key characters. The ending was typical and expected when the first two books where full of the unexpected and thoughtful. The author/editors appeared to lose their focus in the finally. I would have been happy to wait another year and finished with a book worthy of the first two....

Though written as a farce, it has an element of the truth, for many of the members of the Reich were puffed up with their own importance.  That one point was a major one in their ultimate downfall.    I was pleased to add it to my small collections of DVDs of dad's films.

B0000CABBW|3.0|Whale rider is an interesting movie that takes a glimpse into the world of the Maori people. The Maori are an indigenous people that live in New Zealand. Whale Rider centers on a chief (Koro) that is filled with disappointment because his son Porourangi doesn't want to follow in his footsteps and become the next chief of the tribe.  Hope is found when Porourangi's wife becomes pregnant with twins, a boy and a girl. The boy and the mother die during child birth, but the girl lives and is named Piakea by her father. This is a sacred name to Koro and in his anger shortens the child's name to Pai. Porourangi is in grief and goes to Europe leaving Pai to be raised by her grandparents.  Pai knows about her grandfather's disappointment as she grows up but in time they do form a bond.  Nanny Flowers who is Pai's grandmother adores the child and raises her as her on.    Porourangi returns home and refuses to take his place as the next chief and offers to take Pai back to Germany with him, she goes but soon turns around to go back.  In an attempt to find the next chief Koro rounds up all the 12 year old boys and starts to teach them the sacred ways of the tribe. His hope is through all the chants and lessons the next chief will emerge from the group. When Koro finds out Pai has been listening in on the lessons he is enraged. Nanny Flowers then tells Pai that Koro's other son was a fighting stick champion; Pai is intrigued and starts taking lessons from him. After a battle with another boy that Pai wins Koro explodes with anger causing a rift between himself and Pai. Koro drops a whale tooth in the water in hopes that the future chief will retrieve it; after everybody fails Koro loses hope.   In an attempt to help their relationship Pai invites Koro to a play at the school, Pai has something special planned for Koro. Running late Koro notices a number of beached whales on the way to the school. The village attempts to coax the whales back into the ocean with no luck. Pai is then yelled at by Koro for touching the largest whale and tells her she had done enough damage. After Koro walks away Pai climbs on the back of the largest whale and gets him back into the ocean. The other whales follow but in the process Pai nearly drowns.  Koro sees this and is handed the lost whale tooth that Pai had retrieved, Koro breaks down.  At the hospital Koro declares Pai the future chief of the village which is the first for a female. The movie finishes with the entire village pushing a newly finished waka into the ocean to celebrate the new chief.  This movie was intriguing as it showed the daily culture of the Maori people and the struggle that comes with an ingenious tribe. Starting off the movie really gets you involved with the struggles of Pai and her father over the death of Pai's mother and her twin brother. This is where the movie becomes a clash between modern times and ancient traditions. With the grandfather so persistent to find his next replacement, Pai seems to be overlooked and despised because she lived instead of her brother, who would have been the first born grandson. Even when Pai showed excitement and willingness to learn the chiefly ways she was cast aside because she was a girl. This all changed when Pai who never gave up, rode the biggest whale back into the ocean and nearly drowned. This action saved the ways of the tribe and helps the tribe move in the right direction by making Pai the new chief.  This movie showed me the power of being persistent and never giving up, that one child can in fact change the world.

0452273331|3.0|The Fountainhead tells the story of architect Howard Roark, the quintessential \\"ideal man\\" according to Ayn Rand's Objectivist philosophy. Roark is ideal because he never settles for mediocrity, never compromises his artistic vision and never fears to break from tradition to forge his own path. These qualities bring difficulties to his career in architecture; his untraditional ideas and stoic nature are found unacceptable by architects and the general public alike. Roark's work is mostly panned, although a handful of people recognize his genius. Most of the novel deals with how the man and his work are perceived by others, with the main focus on his refusal to concede to the ideas or desires of other people or groups.    Rand aids the reader in understanding Roark by giving him several foils, each of which is a reflection and/or corruption of the \\"ideal man,\\" and most of the novel's action revolves around each foil's connection to the protagonist. Roark's architecture classmate, Peter Keating, is the polar opposite of Roark: he has no passion, he adheres to tradition and he seeks the respect and acknowledgement of others. The art critic and journalist Ellsworth M. Toohey, cognizant of Roark's greatness (and perhaps his own lack of it), subtly manipulates the public through his articles and news connections to attempt to destroy Roark. Gail Wynand is the owner of the largest news organizations in the country. Like Roark, he is passionate and highly competent, but instead of creating great works, Wynand only strives to amass power and influence by pandering to the whims of a vile and fickle public. A quality that unites Roark's foils is their connection to public opinion: Keating relies on the whims and judgments of others (having no opinions of his own), Toohey tells people what their opinions should be and Wynand gives the public the sleazy tabloid pulp they want instead of the real news that they need.    The novel opens with Roark being expelled from architectureschool as Keating is being offered a coveted job at a prestigious architecture firm. Keating thrives in his new position at first, even winning awards for his designs (designs which he could not have completed without Roark's secret aid). Meanwhile, Roark works at a lowly firm and is ridiculed by the public for his strange designs (though beloved by those living in and using his structures). As Roark's fortunes begin to rise and Keating's fortunes fall, Toohey becomes aware of Roark and, recognizing the architect's individualistic spirit, plans his downfall. He convinces a businessman to hire Roark to design a temple, knowing the businessman will be appalled by Roark's design. Toohey nudges the businessman further, creating a public outcry and a well-publicized civic trial.    Despite being forced to pay a settlement that bankrupts his business, Roark works on occasional commissions and eventually comes to the attention of Gail Wynand (who had been a great fan of Roark's designs for many years without knowing the identity of the architect). They strike up a friendship and Wynand feels, for the first time, that he has found a kindred spirit. Roark helps Keating with yet another design, this time for a housing project, on the condition of anonymity and strict adherence to his blueprints. After a committee of architects alters his designs, Rourke blows up the housing project before it can be finished. Wynand is glad for the opportunity to use his power to help his friend and attempts to wield his influence as a newspaper mogul to sway public opinion in Roark's favor. At this point, though, Toohey has managed to insinuate himself into many different levels of society, including Wynand's main newspaper, various journals and several artistic circles and worker's unions, revealing a level of influence no one suspected him of having. With public opinion heavily against him, Roark is brought to trial. He defends himself, making an impassioned speech about the necessity of ego and the glory of the individual, the creator-and the evil of second-handers, who create nothing except altruism, as a method to control the collective and impede the individual. The jury finds him not guilty.    In addition to presenting the realized ideal man, the novel is also an examination of those who fall short and those who are diametrically opposite. Dominique Francon appears to be presented as an example of female greatness; being Roark's lover, there is an implication that she is an ideal woman. And yet, before meeting Roark, she lived the vapid lifestyle of a socialite: attending social functions, dressing up and generally being bored and critical of the world around her. But at least early in the story, she seems to be the cleverest person in the room; encountering Roark changes everything for Dominique. After being raped by Roark, and seemingly enjoying the experience, her independence and power are lost and she succumbs to typical female stereotypes: she falls hopelessly in love with Roark and subsumes her own desires into his. Then, the character takes a strange turn: Dominique, in perhaps her last insightful moment in the story, recognizes that the world will try to destroy Roark's greatness-and aids those forces by doing everything in her power to sabotage his commissions! In her confounding sexual deviance, Dominique desires Roark to physically/sexually overpower her, but only allows herself this pleasure after she has thwarted one of his commissions. And Roark seems perfectly content to allow her to do this! With the damage she does to Roark's works, she resembles the antagonistic Toohey much more than the ideal Roark.    Although Dominique is personally responsible for withholding some of Roark's work from the world, she soon grows disenchanted with the world for not recognizing his greatness. She decides she wants no pleasure in a world like this and ends her trysts with Roark. Dominique's perplexing, self-destructive behavior doesn't end there; she seeks to make herself miserable by marrying someone who is the opposite of Roark, someone she despises: Peter Keating. When the opportunity arises to make herself more miserable by marrying someone even worse, she divorces Keating and marries the powerful and ruthless Gail Wynand. The mogul ends up being more similar to Roark than anyone could have guessed but it's her intention to punish herself that makes Dominique's actions so difficult to comprehend. She doesn't seem very much like an ideal person, let alone Roark's ideal mate.    Ellsworth M. Toohey, in a quite obvious and heavy-handed way, is Rand's explanation for why altruism is evil. Toohey is a critic and lover of the arts, hero to and supporter of the common man, selfless, generous, religious and intelligent. He is a man known, respected and loved by the public. He preaches the suppression of the self in service to others and almost always presents himself in this way to others: he lives and dresses modestly, organizes meetings of artists and unions (never accepting pay for this work) and writes articles appealing to the traditional values of the public. But he is the villain of the story! As his aunt describes him, he is a maggot. He thrives on the despair of others and takes particular delight in crushing the spirits of those who have greatness in them. In his heart, Toohey is really a cynic. He doesn't believe in anything he preaches, only that his machinations will give him power. He sees the edifices of mankind: government, religion, civilization-as structures of control. And he wants to be the one to pull the lever that makes the gears of the world turn. In essence, Toohey aims to be a secret ruler of men and has realized that the easiest men to control are those who have no individuality; those who have suppressed the self and have submitted to a form of societal control.    Though Rand's method of denouncing altruism is unsubtle and perhaps even sophomoric, it is certainly entertaining andprovocative, especially in the example of Toohey's extended rant to Peter Keating about his vision of a subservient society. In one of the most memorable passages of the novel, Toohey describes the way to destroy greatness:    \\"Don't set out to raze all shrines-you'll frighten men. Enshrine mediocrity-and the shrines are razed.\\"    In other words, men can't be convinced that there aren't great things in the world, but if they can be fooled into believing that the banal is the ideal, they will lose the ability to create or even recognize greatness. One can't help but find an eerie analogue of this in today's media-saturated society: reality stars trump truly talented actors in popularity and recognition, consumer goods are sold based on endorsements instead of quality manufacturing and books and movies are judged more on sales figures than critical reception. A similar observation can be made about the apathy and indifference of the general population concerning politics, poverty, hunger, war, etc. Being inundated with these concerns from so many sources, it's no surprise that images of needless death and destruction don't horrify people as much as they should. Perhaps Rand had it right, from a certain perspective...    On the whole, The Fountainhead isn't particularly well-written (it reads like a romance novel in some places) and the characters and situations aren't very realistic. However, this is a book of examples, of ideas in motion; each character is a representative for one of two ideas: a variant of the ideal spirit or a collectivist/second-hander. Rand's Objectivist ideas about the greatness of the individual are, admittedly, seductive; everyone believes on some level that their integrity and vision should never be compromised. Roark is an attractive exemplar because his work is described as being genuinely better than the work of the architects who cling to outdated tradition. One flaw that materializes, however, is that the \\"ideal man,\\" even in the worldof the novel, appears to be an infrequent occurrence. Henry Cameron, for example, is crushed, physically and spiritually, for clinging to his own ideas on architecture, as is Stephen Mallory (until Roark comes along and gives the young sculptor purpose). Gail Wynand misuses his ego to acquire power. Dominique Francon has masochistic tendencies. Only the seemingly inhuman Roark is able to make his ego work for him.    This brings up a larger question: if, in the context of a fictional novel, individuals cannot successfully maintain their integrity and do great things, what hope do people in the real world have? What about untalented people? How does a janitor or a cab driver or a waiter act with integrity? Taking Wynand as an example from the novel, it is not clear how he could have used his ideal nature to run his newspaper differently. Perhaps he could have published real news instead of tabloid fodder, but this most likely would have caused his newspaper to go bankrupt (in one passage, he describes an early experiment in trying to publish both kinds of news, with sales and profits favoring sleazy tabloid news). Sticking to his guns would have resulted in falling into obscurity like Cameron. Similarly, what could Dominique have done differently? She already spoke her mind in her art criticism and social interactions, yet she was miserable, inflicting new kinds of pain on herself to forget the troubles of the world. Cameron is perhaps the most interesting character to consider: he is just as stubbornly insistent on maintaining his integrity as Roark. His personality is similarly abrasive. In all the ways that count for Rand, Cameron is virtually identical to Roark, from talent to attitude to intelligence. However, Roark gains some semblance of public acceptance and personal fulfillment by the end of the novel while Cameron does not, and the novel does not explain why Roark succeeded and Cameron died dejected and bitter. If characters so similar to Roark cannot succeed in the same world he did, how much harder would it be for real people in our non-fictional world? These questions are not adequately addressed by Rand in The Fountainhead.    Perhaps it is asking too much to have a book work well as a piece of literature and a philosophical treatise that applies to the real world. It's sometimes difficult to separate the Objectivist Philosophy from the content of the book, but Rand's case for the individual as being the prime mover of progress and the collective being the destroyer of progress is too simplistic. Wasn't it men coming together to form tribes in ancient times that allowed everyone to survive against savage beasts and hunt large game? Rand's attacks on altruism fall apart when applied to any place that isn't democratic: could Roark have achieved his greatness if he was born into a low caste in India? In a poor village in Uganda? In medieval England? Ancient Egypt? Living in a democracy provides initial conditions and opportunities to those living there and democracy is the product of a form of collectivism.    Despite its inconsistencies and simplicity, The Fountainhead makes for a thought-provoking read; I spent a few months thinking about it before putting my thoughts down in this review. It's easy to see why so many young, impressionable teens latch onto this book, falling in love with the notions of breaking from tradition and walking your own path, as these ideas are so much a part of the teenage experience in the West. But it's also pretty clear why most (but not all) twenty-somethings discard and dismiss this book; it takes a certain level of maturity and distance from puberty to understand that ego is not always great and altruism does not always entail a loss of self to the collective.

1416955070|3.0|I was on a vacation with my friends and had finished two of my books fairly quickly. I went to Wal-Mart to buy another book to keep me interested. I stumbled upon this one. I picked it up and decided to give it a shot--the plot seemed interesting enough: Clary Fray and her best friend Simon are thrust into the world of Shadowhutners (Nephilim, a race of human/angels) and Downworlders (vampires, werewolves, faeries, etc.) I read it quickly and finished it after a few hours.    ***This review contains minor and major SPOILERS***    I will admit that Cassandra Clare was one of the better YA writers and her book City of Bones (and series) were better than average (certainly better than the House of Night series), but that's not really saying much. Ms. Clare had lots of room to improve. Like most reviewers have mentioned, the plot is everything but original. But, honestly, what is *truly* original? I do not fault Ms. Clare for using an unoriginal plotline that's been done to death (Big Bad needs big bad thing to do big bad deeds), but I fault her for what she does with the plot. It's important for me as a reviewer to let people know that nothing is truly original, especially when you read a lot of books in the \\"fantasy\\" genre, but Cassandra Clare fails to do anything to her unoriginal plot that makes it truly, \\"hers\\".     For one, the characters are lacking. Like many reviewers have mentioned, Clarissa \\"Clary\\" Fray is, at her core, a Mary Sue. A Mary Sue is someone who is unrealistically perfect, someone who gets everything yet gives back nothing. For example: Bella Swan is a Mary Sue. Zoey Redbird is a Mary Sue. Anita Blake is a Mary Sue. Ever Bloom...okay, well she's not exactly a Mary Sue, but she sure as hell is a dumbass. Jace, while intriguing, was nothing short of your generic anti-hero. Isabelle was your typical badass bitch who is actually has more depth than you think.     The plot twist at the end with ***IF YOU IGNORED MY EARLIER WARNING AND ARE STILL READING, THIS IS A SPOILER*** Jace and Clary supposedly being related to one another, felt cheap as if a cop-out. Ms. Clare's writing was average, chunky at times, but not nearly as bad as some people are making it out to be.     Yet, I still gave this book 3 out of 5 stars. Why? Because I enjoyed it. My advice for anyone who is thinking about reading it is: give it a try, but read with an open mind. From merely a critique standpoint, this book would have gotten a 2 out of 5 if I had not included that I *enjoyed* it. This book can only be as good as you want it, too. If you are a picky reader and is looking for a more thought provoking novel, then put this book down and run away. However, if you're looking for a fairly quick read that's fun and entertaining, I would recommend this book.    So overall, this book is nothing special, but it is enjoyable as long as you let yourself enjoy it. That being said, I did stick with the series and can, with a clear conscious in mind say that the next two books are better than this one and it is obvious how much Ms. Clare has improved on. If you liked this book, then read the next two because you will not be disappointed. If you were on the fence, I would suggest reading the next book. If you absolutely hated this book then there is no need to pick up the next two.     Overall Grade: A-/B+   3 out of five stars.     Other recommended books: City of Ashes (Book 2), City of Glass (Book 3), Clockwork Angel (prequel), Gemma Doyle Trilogy, Harry Potter series, Darkest Powers series by Kelley Armstrong.

B001H7SJLC|4.0|I like this fan. The only trouble with it, is that it seems to have sleeve bearings, so i doubt it will last very long.    Otherwise, it's has a really low profile, compared to a Thermaltake i have, conduction heat transfer, has a system board connector, and proper size mounting screws.    My case is really hot. In an 24 C room, it keeps my 7200rpm drives about 40-41C, which is about 7-8 degrees C lower than it was without the fan.     (The Thermaltake i have on a second drive give almost exactly the same numbers, and is a little cheaper, but doesn't have conduction heat transfer, a board connector, or the right size mount screws for the bottom mount.)    I would buy another Scythe fan one, when i need it.

B00007J4SI|3.0|Michael Ponti's Scriabin survey is one of the great lost opportunities in the history of recorded classical music. Several other reviewers have already pointed out the main pros and cons of this 5-disc box set--above all that Ponti is an accomplished Scriabin pianist, that his playing is often unfinished here, that the Vox sonics are absolutely horrific, and that the billed 'complete' collection only becomes so together with the [[ASIN:B00007J4SK Complete Sonatas]] twofer.<br /><br />What I would like to add is the following: Concerning the disastrous sound, which belongs to amongst the worst I have heard in stereo, I fear that Eurisko Lontano may well be accurate in his remarkable remarks posted under Dace Gisclard's review of the Sonatas--'the pianist was forced to use an UPRIGHT piano, and often slept on the floor between recording session[s]'. Indeed, the sound is just too awful to have originated from a proper grand piano, which is why the upright piano explanation makes a great deal of sense. Nonetheless, even when disregarding the often sloppy execution and the near-unlistenable sound, Ponti's Scriabin playing is at best frustratingly variable.<br /><br />In a world where Scriabin's music remains largely neglected and misunderstood, Ponti filled a vast gap for several decades. Gordon Fergus-Thompson started a rival survey on ASV in 1993; he recorded the complete Etudes, Preludes, Mazurkas and six Sonatas before ASV was bought by Sanctuary Classics and eventually eaten up by Universal, which pulled the plug on the project (although it can still be read on the Sanctuary website that 'Gordon Fergus-Thompson will soon complete his recording of the complete works of Scriabin for ASV'). However, considering the overall poor quality of the playing--sluggish, unidiomatic and virtually deprived of intensity--it was not until two years ago that Ponti was rivalled and surpassed by Maria Lettberg. Indeed, it is fair to say that on all grounds, Ponti's Scriabin survey is now eclipsed by Lettberg's meticulously prepared, admirably executed and well-recorded 9-disc box set on Austrian Capriccio.<br /><br />I believe Ponti's most successful contribution is the Etudes on the second disc. Granted, there are several moments of rather unpolished, even harsh, playing. On the other hand, the erratic quality, at least partly originating from the recording conditions, adds a nervous dimension that actually suits this music quite well. Regrettably, the very same quality suits the Preludes, Mazurkas and Morceaux less well--too often sounding rushed, unprepared and generic. What is so frustrating, though, is that there are a number of really good performances intermingled with rather awful ones. For instance, the forth disc opens with at the same time fiery and subtle performances of the Op 21 Polonaise and the Op 22 Preludes; then comes the Op 25 Mazurkas which more often than not sounds as though being sight-read; the Op 27 Preludes sound loud and hesitant, respectively; and the masterly Op 28 B-minor Fantaisie gets an outright brutal reading, about as harsh as approximate; as from around track 20 the piano goes out of tune--and so does Ponti in his grand volatility.<br /><br />All the same, there are a number of throughout great performances that deserve special mention together with the above-noted Etudes: a truly passionately done Op 4 Allegro Appassionato, a most exquisite rendition of the Op 9 Prelude & Nocturne for the left hand, some darkly beautiful versions of the two greatest Impromptus, Opp 12/2 & 14/2, and a blazing Op 18 Allegro de concert.<br /><br />REFERENCE: [[ASIN:B000W4E3OS Lettberg]]Lettberg's meticulously prepared, admirably executed and well-recorded 9-disc box set on Austrian Capriccio.

B0025UHKNS|5.0|I read both the good and bad reviews for this watch and realized that all of the gps watches 'appeared' to have shortcomings here or there. Shortcomings supposedly included accuracy, problems with the touch bezel and how long the battery lasted. But I went ahead and purchased this watch about a month ago, and couldn't be happier. I work out before work 4-5 times a week in the morning, and also follow up with a recreational walk/jog in the afternoon a couple of times a week. I found this watch very easy to set up, both using the menu on the watch as well as the software included with the watch. Measurement of distance and heart rate monitoring were very accurate. And after completing a 45 minute jog, the battery life was only down 7-8% consistently.   Another benefit of this watch is the software included with the watch. When I finish with my workout, and set the watch on my desk next to my computer, it will automatically upload the session data and display the workout summary. You can also see a history of your workout, which includes your minute-by-minute heart rate, pace and distance traveled. You can also upload the info to connect.[...]with the push of button and share the info with your friends.  I really love this watch and feel it is well worth the price. I works great and is feature rich in options. Garmin has done a great job with this watch!

0439023513|5.0|I've never thrown a book before. I've never stared at a book that's laying across the room and viscerally hated it.     Then I read \\"Mockingjay.\\" And now I've done both.    After hearing \\"The Hunger Games\\" series being heralded as \\"The new 'Twilight'\\" I made every effort to steer clear of it. Only after I had a friend whose opinion I trust implicitly tell me that they were nothing like \\"Twilight\\" did I go out and get a copy of \\"The Hunger Games. Then I immediately went out and got \\"Catching Fire.\\" Then I immediately went out and got \\"Mockingjay.\\"    And then I started throwing.    (Note: There are spoilers below).    I know many, many other reviewers have touched on the disappointments that are obvious in this book: The death of characters you come to love being tossed away without ceremony (I have to admit, when I finally let go of hope that Cinna would show up midway through the book, it was one of the things that hit me the hardest), the needless drawing out of the embarrassing \\"love triangle,\\" the way none of the characters acted the way they should, the lack of a romantic flourish to leave us with a neatly wrapped relationship.    When I first read the ending, I have to admit that I skimmed along, skipping entire paragraphs in a frantic search for Peeta's name, inwardly counting down, \\"Okay, only seven pages left, SURELY she's going to have him pop up now and sweep Katniss off her feet and it will be business as usual.\\"    And then five pages. And then three. And then the final page and the epilogue, and then the dramatic toss of my book into the wall.    Then I left it. I made myself not think about it, because for the first time ever I read a book and wished immediately not to have done so. I was so upset with the way the ending seemed tacked on, as if Suzanne Collins got to the end, realized that a decision hadn't been made, and said, \\"Okay aaaaaand.... Peeta! That's it! The end!\\"    But, against my best judgement, I went back to it. I turned to the ending and re-read it. And, although I'm not a sap, and although even as a nineteen year old I stayed dry-eyed through \\"The Notebook,\\" I wept. The ending as it is is perfect. It's unbearably painful to not get the happy ever after epilogue that you want for characters that you've invested yourself in. You want to hear the romantic lines, the thrill of the proposal, the tears that dot eyes at the wedding.     But Suzanne Collins gave us those: We had their first kiss. We had their stories. We had the proposal (as anticlimactic as it might be). We had Katniss in her wedding dress and Peeta in a tuxedo. We even had their first child.    What was lacking was authenticity. And in that page in a half, in the return of the sweetness that was lacking for the entire book (and this was, really, a hard book, especially since the character that I looked to for empathy, for compassion, was missing for ninety-nine percent of it), we see what Katniss has become: that she has needed to become the girl on fire metaphorically, then symbolically, and finally literally, to become the pearl that Effie famously predicted she would be, that the layers she shielded herself with would burn off and what would be left would be the essence of her core that recognized her weaknesses and, more importantly, turned elsewhere for her strengths. At last we have a girl who is acting not out of need to provide for her family, or to keep a promise, or in return for something else. We have a girl who has lost most everything she holds dear and in her we find our heroine, in her we find an unbelievable character, and in her, we at last find the romance.    So don't take this book as is, because it is painful to lose character after character after character, it is painful, like I said, to lose the sweetness that Peeta brings, it is painful to see the devastating impact that the war has on every person we've come to love.    But in the pain is beauty. And the beauty is unforgettable.
B002ZG98C8|4.0|After seeing the first two Grind House features and the \\"fake\\" Machete trailer in the begining, I knew that there was no way that Rodriguez wasn't going to make it into a film.Well,this film does not dissapoint, full on action from start to finish starting with nudity buckets of blood and gartuitus violence,everything I wanted and expected Machete to be.     Fallow Machete as he hacks his way back to vengence while leading a revoloution. Hot women with guns and in skin tight leather pants.Who could possibly resist seeing Michelle Rodriguez or Jessica Alba in that?Plenty of laughs throughout,lots of inside jokes,puns and great cameos. Some of the funniest scenes were watching Steven Segal portray a Mexican drug lord and well...Lindsy Lohan not reallying portraying more than herself.A spoiled rich effed up crack whore.I wonder if she did that intentionally or had no clue  her character was the butt of the joke?     You really have to hand it to Robert Rodriguez, considering that the first to Grind House features were commercially unsuccessful, he went ahead and made another one.It just goes to show that he isn't in this just for the money, he truely loves film, creating fantastic over the top characters and telling great stories with style.This none is definately worth paying the big dollars to see in the late evening,and I'd even pay to see it again.Don't cheat yourself, you'll regret missing this one on the big screen.

0792107683|5.0|\\"Shane\\" was indeed the best western ever for various reasons. The cinematography was splendid and rightly award-winning. The score begins by waxing serenely to reflect the beautiful scenery, but as Shane later rides toward the necessary conflict resolution showdown, the score thunders vigorously (like a heart pounding) and menacingly.    Any movie depends on casting...they first planned to have the moody, remote Montgomery Clift play Shane and William Holden play the Van Heflin part. Though Clift was a better actor than Alan Ladd, once you have seen the finished product, it is clear that this was the role of his life for Ladd, brought out by George Stevens' fine, demanding and meticulous direction (there were months of careful retakes to get it just right). William Holden was not near the actor that Van Heflin was and would not have fit so well...Starrett needed to be less physically attractive to Marian and Joey, though he was not less courageous than Shane...he had the heart of a lion.     Alan Ladd, despite his slight stature, with his deep voice could at least pull off the tough, mythical western hero, even if they did have to use the typical camera angle tricks to make him seem taller. The brawl scene in the bar was excellent, and the final showdown was perfect-- an immediate legend. Think of the dog slinking out smelling danger...and the petrified look of the bartender. And since the story was also a coming of age story for Joey, he had to be there to witness his new-found hero to finish off the bad guys-- \\"And Joey, tell them there are no more guns in the valley.\\" There were a few too-wooden Alan Ladd lines, as when he tells Marian-- \\"A gun is a tool--only as good or as bad as the man using it--remember that, Marian.\\" But overall, Stevens drew out the best that Alan Ladd had on screen.     The other actors also fit so well. Jean Arthur, back from retirement for this one role, served well as Marian...she must fight her attraction to the mysterious, handsome Shane...he is like the bad boy that women are so often attracted to. And she knows that Shane is wistfully attracted to the life that she represents-- home cooking and serenity. The viewer has no choice but to dislike the Ryker brothers. Ben Johnson was born to play a western character. Can a villain get any nastier than Jack Palance...he won the Oscar decades later for reprising essentially the same tough guy, except also with humor, in \\"City Slickers.\\"    Edgar Buchanan plays the great weasel, enviously mocking the truly courageous Shane early on. And in that portrayal of the mythical gunslinger hero, Alan Ladd does indeed excel, if only this one time. You simply know that he has killed before, but you also know that he sides with the good people...perhaps he killed to avenge his father's death, but you know instinctively that he knows right from wrong and he will be there when it counts on the side of right.     What some miss is that Joe Starrett (allegorical for \\"Start\\") is no less tough and courageous, but as Shane says to him as Shane girds himself to go defeat the bad guys-- \\"This is not your kind of fight, Joe.\\" In the real world, there were perhaps no stand-up, quick draw shootouts in the old west, BUT as myth it is as real and valued as Achilles facing Hector. And I agree with another reviewer noting that \\"the final climactic shoot-out has been described by many western film scholars as the best that was ever put to film.\\" Note that Shane allows Wilson to go for his gun first...and watch Shane swallow hard as he stands erect for the final test of someone's life...life cannot get more dramatic and serious.    Watch the very last scene of the movie again...in the moonlight, Shane rides slowly through the cemetery featured prominently earlier with his wounded side stiff above the saddle...is he going off to die? Regardless, he rides off into movie legend-- the brave, loner American hero having sacrificed himself for the common good.    In real life, Alan Ladd's life was tragic-- he saw his alcoholic mother commit suicide, and he himself would die at just 50 due to drug and alcohol abuse. His career was limited--only about 10 truly good years...but he was voted the most popular male star after \\"Shane\\" because it and he were truly special, if only once. He will be forever Shane...and that is a good legacy.    I liked \\"The Searchers\\" and \\"High Noon\\" (Gary Cooper was always fine) well enough, but \\"Shane\\" stands out as the best of the genre.
0307454541|3.0|Not sure what the big deal is about this book - its just ok.  Note that the main topic of the book is a series a gruesome murders of young women spanning 60 years. The author also throws in a brutal rape scene, torture, etc.  The original title was something like \\"the man who hated women.\\"  The secondary female character was sort of interesting, but she is another one of these autistic rain man types with various super powers to make up for her social shortcomings.  Can't really recommend it.  Why do all paperbacks have to be over 600 pages these days - could have been done in 250 easily.
B002NUULNG|3.0|First and foremost,  I want to mention I saw the original version when it was released in 1995/96.<br />It was a landmark narrative in terms of production and story line.  Not since Akira did an animated feature<br />go beyond its boundries and become a solid classic sci-fi masterpiece.  My jaw dropped during the opening<br />title sequence ( those green cascading numbers turning into letters have long since been ripped off (borrowed/homaged)  by<br />the Matrix trilogy).<br /><br /> Now skip forward 14 years later to V2.0<br /><br />Cons:<br /><br />1.Not sure what the revision was about,  It certainly doesn't add to the power of the original.<br />They added in modern CG to replace the most memorable shots.  Transition is like going<br />from salt water to fresh water,  a bit jarring.  I suggest a V3.0 and fully render the entire<br />narrative.  With the technology in full swing and past rendered features such as Appleseed<br />and Final Fantasy,  its a shame that a full rendered treatment wasn't applied to the entire feature.<br /><br />2.The overall color of the feature has gone from that greenish/blue tint to a yellowish golden<br />tint to better match the new CG.<br /><br />3. The iconic title/credit sequences with the cascading numbers turning into letters has<br />been replaced with some modern bio/morphing sequences,  to me this is near blasphemy.<br /><br />Pros:<br />1. This BR disc has the original version for viewing the old classic. BT image itself is clean/crisp.<br /><br />2.  6.1 DTS ES discrete sound (fantastic audio created with the help of Skywalker Sound)<br /><br />3.  some extras like The making of the GITS, production report.<br /><br />I would recommend that whomever buys this BR disc view the original version ( If they've not experienced GITS before ) first.

B002KKCWP4|5.0|I have a hard time finding a good-fitting shoe of any kind--I have wide, flat feet and a spine that lets me know when things aren't right.    I have been enormously surprised and pleased how well these Teva sandals work for me.  Their arch has more than I do, but it's supportive.  The footbed is forgiving enough that weight is well-distributed.  And I can wear them comfortably all day.  Great traction too.    Amazing.  A sandal worth trying for others who have a hard time finding _any_ well-fitting footwear.

B001HN694K|3.0|Most of the many attempts at filming Alice In Wonderland haven't been particularly successful, for two reasons. First, directors seem to feel that the movie must have a strong male character. Lewis Carroll didn't give them one (all the male characters in the books are rather spineless and feeble) so they invent their own, usually, for some reason, the Mad Hatter. Second, they misread the character of Alice. In the book she is headstrong, inquisitive and feisty; she dominates the other characters even as she takes part in their fantastic world. She is not a spectator, watching what they do, but a full participant, accepting. or more often rejecting, their view of life. She's not, nor is she meant to be, a nice girl meekly accepting what befalls her.    Unfortunately, Tim Burton's 'Alice' falls into both these traps. Instead of being a passing character Alice meets along the way, the Mad Hatter becomes central to the film and in doing so destroys much of the point of the tale. Alice herself, though she has her moments of rebellion, is played far too passively; she's more often merely watching what goes on in  Wonderland. In making her character too detached, Burton loses the involvement that the audience should feel and which has made the books so successful for so long.    On the plus side, Wonderland itself is marvelously realized. I love the bright colors, the ever-more-convincing computer graphics and the strange flora and fauna which inhabit this suitably dream-like place. Everything looks as it's supposed to- distorted versions of reality, only possible in the imagination. The story meanders far from the original tales, but I have no problem with that, as long as it holds together. Tim Burton is the master at making a fantasy world come to life.    It's a fun movie to watch. It just doesn't make the audience feel involved.

0596805888|5.0|I was a food columnist for two years and worked in the restaurant industry for six years before moving to academia.  My family and I are notoriously blas&eacute; about food and approaches to food.  &#34;Not a damn thing I haven't eaten before...&#34; is a familiar refrain upon open a menu.  In other words, I'm a skeptic (some would say a jerk) - especially when it comes to the trendy and overhyped.  So, upon receiving Jeff Potter's Cooking for Geeks, I opened and started reading it with a (chocolate) chip on my shoulder.<br />What I wanted to make was Regan's Orange Bitters No. 5 (pg. 296), but I soon realized I would need at least two weeks to gather all the ingredients and let it age.  But I really wanted to try one of these recipes out as soon as possible.  Fortuitously, my mother called and said that she was hosting my brother's family, in from Syracuse, for a dinner.  Knowing that Mom loathes cooking, I asked what she was making.  &#34;A steak,&#34; she replied.  &#34;A steak for eight people?&#34; I said kidding her.  &#34;Well, it's a big steak and I don't really feel like cooking.&#34;  Deciding to flesh out the evening's menu, I offered to bring some food.  Having Potter's book in hand, I decide to take a look at what he had to say about this summertime staple at my house, Tomato Basil Mozzarella Salad (pg. 124)<br />I had tomatoes and basil on hand, from my garden.  But following Potter's comments, I started thinking about variables - in this case the ingredients.  So, I ended up making the salad several times - a &#34;control&#34; salad made according to Potter's recipe and then one with grocery store tomatoes (disgusting), one with farm stand tomatoes (nice, less watery than my own, but not as explosive in smell we decided), one with chunked ingredients rather than slices I usually use and most interesting - basil grown hydroponically vs. basil grown in my garden (garden hands down, much more flavor and intense color).  But Cooking for Geeks makes me think about even more - ok, it tastes better, but why does it taste better?  Why does my compost grown basil taste better than the supermarket hydro version?<br />What does all this prove?  Well nothing really - not about tomato mozzarella salad at least.  Instead, looking at food the way Potter suggests in his book helps to move me out of my &#34;expert&#34; ennui.  Cooking for Geeks makes one see recipes as experiments.  Do I still dislike the sous vide cooking?  Yup (but mostly because of the personality of the people I know who are gung ho for it...  Potter excepted.)  But I've already started jotting down ideas about taking Potter's concept and applying it to his own recipes (Would Oaxacan Drinking Chocolate (pg 17) taste better made with cocoa nibs and rice milk?  You can bet I'm going to find out and then discover why...)<br />There's a lot in this book - both in case of number of recipes, but more importantly in ideas.  Fall and winter will be here soon in Western Pennsylvania, and I think this book is going to keep occupied through the short days when cooking becomes a recreational indoor sport.<br /> If I had to do it over again, I would have pushed it further and made my own mozzarella for the salad (pg 288).  Heck, if I really had my druthers, I'd park a water buffalo at the old man's farm and run comparison contrast exercises with different milk types!re - ok, it tastes better, but why does it taste better?

However, it gives you breathtaking digital image for those who really want to evaluate what actually the Bluray technology can deliver.  Although I´ve seen other movies in HD Bluray disc, this one is undoubtly a ground breaking on image quality, mainly if got a good screen. I mean, a larger than 40inch fullHD screen will do the job nicely. For those who couldn´t enjoy the IMAX experience of Avatar on the theaters, this BD delivers a comparable sensation.  Ideal for bluray equipment setup tests!

0061251305|5.0|According to Dave Logan, in the work place, there are 5 tribal stages. Stage One's theme is \\"Life sucks\\"; Stage Two \\"My life sucks\\"; Stage Three \\"I am great and you are not\\"; Stage Four \\"we are great and they are not\\" and Stage Five \\"Life is great\\".    Stage Three represents 49% of workplace. That means while people often preach the need for teams, their behavior shows that they discourage teaming - unless it is a situation where they can be the star. The performance review system makes the culture more individualistic. People attempt to outperform each other. The language they use expresses \\"I am great\\" and in the background unstated  is \\"and you are not\\".  They hoard information to keep power.  They rely on gossip and spies for political information. They are hungry for tips, tools and techniques  that will keep them ahead of their competition. They talk about values and focus on \\"my values\\". The cost is that they have many blind spots, don't have enough time and don't get enough support. They can't get to the next level.     The purpose of the book is to build great companies, and this means getting you and your tribe to Stage Four - 22% of the workplace. They walk in values and want to collaborate. They are happy, inspired, genuine and identify with each other. They work less and produce more. They communicate more information, more often and with transparency.
0439023513|1.0|No character development, instead we have an author who seems torn between satisfying her fans (aka a tacked-on \\"fairy tale ending\\") and making an over-used, highly contrived, and predictable statement on war and society. Brave New World, 1984, Fahrenheit 451 - they've all been done before, to much more thought-provoking conclusions. Collins seems to forget the resilience of the human mind and spirit, even against insurmountable odds. She didn't even care to give her characters enough depth to have coping mechanisms - such as dark humor or addictions. They were just empty and lacking motivation. Overall, that's about how I felt reading the whole book. Like Katniss, it's a wonder I got to the last page at all.

0439023513|4.0|With Mockingjay being one of the most highly anticipated books released in 2010, expectations ran high. So high, that I don't think Suzanne Collins could have possibly satisfied all Hunger Games fans no matter how she decided to end the trilogy. I'll admit, I expected this book to be monumental. After two books that were some of the most amazing I had ever read, only epic greatness would have ended the trilogy in a manner it deserved.<br /><br />I'll start with the bad first. I feel that Collins too the easy way out. Sure, things happen - important things at that, but everything has a hint of predictability. Those jaw-dropping, tear-inducing, completely rip-your-heart-out moments that made the previous books were surprisingly absent in Mockingjay. There was no instances of the big, ugly cry. Never once did I have to stop and think \\"Wow, she really just did that.\\"<br /><br />My other complaint about Mockingjay is the pacing. The book is SLOW and doesn't pick up until the third part, about halfway through the book. We see a lot of thought and internal issues with Katniss and planning by the rebels, but no real action. A book that should have kept me glued to its pages, took me three days to finish reading because the first 200 pages weren't all that enthralling. I put the book down to do other things constantly. This was a huge change from the first two books where nothing in the world could have dragged me away from word one.<br /><br />Now, the good. We get answers. Absolutely nothing is left unanswered. Too many series end without tying up loose plot points, so the fact that we know everything in the end is very important.<br /><br />The story is complete. Along with answers along the way, we get answers to what we may have wondered about the future. An epilogue, a la Harry Potter, allows us a quick look into the future and we know for certain how things continue to play out after the book ends.<br /><br />The romance aspect of the story will be interpreted by readers depending on what team (Peeta or Gale) they've been on throughout the series. Looking at it as unbiasedly as I can, I'll say it was good in that I really didn't know which way it was going to go until late in the book. It felt at times that each guy had a chance. I don't like the reason the book romance worked out the way it did. For such a strong character, Katniss has always been way too wishy-washy about her love life. I feel there should have been a firm decision made by her as to why she ends up with the guy she does, instead of kind of just accepting the situation that presents itself.<br /><br />As always, Suzanne Collins as given fans a good story. It's no where near the emotional roller coaster it should have been, but it ends the trilogy in decent, acceptable way. I feel let down by the book, which is partly due to my personal expectations, the huge hype and the lack of shocking moments I loved in the previous books. Mockingjay will definitely be debated by fans for years to come.le) they've been on throughout the series.

0385504225|2.0|There's no simpler way to put this - The Lost Symbol is a book that should be literally lost for all time.  The Da Vinci Code (DVC), and the much more fun and interesting Angels and Demons (AD), left me wanting more as i turned page by page to get to the plot climax.  With The Lost Symbol, I kept waiting for myself to be put out of agony.  While DVC and AD provided a great reward for listening to the musings of Robert Langdon as he went into deep intellectual diatribes on religion and symbolism, there was no such gratification here.  Without giving away too much, the revelation of The Lost Symbol itself was more of a \\"Captain Obvious\\" moment in which the revealed symbol ended up being something that is really nothing new to readers.<br /><br />This was such a disappointment, and I can't even fathom how they will make this exciting enough to be a film.  This book was painful.  Do not expect much enjoyment out of it.
B001VNB54A|5.0|The Pacific is a much more artistic and fuller told story than Band of Brothers. The acting, writing, photography and direction of The Pacific are all superior. The difference is in the details. For example, the view of one of the main characters lying dead on Iwo Jima slowly pans back to show the many other Marines also lying dead or wounded there. When another scene shows another one of the main characters getting off a train, it also shows another Marine with his right arm missing walking close behind him. Perhaps the acting is better partly because the story focuses on only a few Marines during and after the war whereas you never really get to know any of the characters in depth in Band of Brothers. Everything really comes together in the tenth and last episode showing how various Marines adapted differently to civilian life after they return home. One vows to never wear his uniform again while another wears his to impress (and later marry) the girl across the street. The creators of The Pacific take their time to finish their story in this last episode and accordingly they leave a fine lasting impression of this masterpiece.
B003REEPJS|1.0|Of course shes tamed. Miley is a corporate automaton and shill for The Disney Corporation. Every thing is calculated (including this move to make her appear rebellious).

0385504225|5.0|This book arrived promptly and in great shape.  I have not completed reading it, but like all Dan Brown's books, it is intriguing!  Anyway, I couldn't wait for this one to come out in paperback and the price was reasonable at Amazon and it qualified for free shipping.
B0029LHW68|5.0|I don't understand why there are people that do not like this CD. Yes it is very different from the previous 2 CD's but it's still rather catchy. Hurricane is downright beautiful, and the Stranger In A Strange Land is like their early dark stuff, but there are no bad songs on here. It's catchy and very anthem-like. Each album is different. No one should expect anything less from this one. I just recently heard of this band, and they definitely have a fan for life. Listening to the samples don't do the CD justice. Night of the Hunter and the remix is really addictive too. I like that they can do different stuff. The drums on this CD are amazing. All in all I think this is very good. I just hope they don't wait almost 5 years before releasing another album!
B002ZG9788|5.0|Lots of action a little different from the older Hollywood version. Animation was well done.
0670021652|4.0|I admire Ms Gilbert's approach to the subject. This book is a carefully considered confessional-    And I guess I should stop right there: anyone who saw 'Eat, Love, Pray' as 'self-indulgent' or 'crap on every level', keep moving. There's really nothing for you here.    So this book is about the author approaching her second marriage, and while she does, while she's mired in all the post-9/11 complications of marrying a 'foreigner', she provides some pretty fascinating insight into the history of marriage, how it's perceived in various parts of the world, while throwing into the mix the specifics of her own experiences (and those of her parents, specifically). The result is an satisfying read...for those open to the examination. (And I do have to add that if you like her writing style...because she's written for so many men's magazines, I suppose you could put it under that banner...then the subject matter will be received well by you. While if you're not a fan of how she writes, then once again, keep moving.)    I was especially touched by how she was able to relate some of the more personal elements of her investigation. For example, this:    \\"She was happy because she had a partner, and because they were building something together, and because she believed deeply in what they were building and because it amazed her to be included in such an undertaking.\\"    This is not a groundbreaking book. It is, in its own way, a 'beach book'; not too much substance, not too much fluff...but stirring enough to have you gazing out at the water, having been sent off on your own examinations.

B002ZG9788|1.0|Remake is bad, the fact everyone knows.  But this one is bad beyond belief.  How can someone create a motion picture of this low quality working with brilliant actors such as Liam Neeson and Sam Worthington?  I sincerely hope this trash will not damage reputations and future career of these gentlemen; especially a young and promising talent   like Mr. Worthington.  It is sad and horrifying to completely waste two hours of precious time of everyone.
B001OQCV6K|3.0|For me, the negatives outweigh the positives of this movie, and I found it dull overall.<br /><br />To start with the positives, (a) I always enjoy historical British settings and (b) Holmes' powers of hyperperception and hyperinference (as much inductive as deductive) made me wonder if I couldn't do better myself if I tried harder.<br /><br />But on the negative side, (a) I found the portrayal of Holmes as slovenly and borderline disfunctional to be hard to swallow, (b) I literally found it difficult to understand what Holme's was saying much of the time, due to his rapid yet quiet mumbling, (c) the plot is fairly childish and somewhat disjointed, and (d) the pace is slow, to the extent that it felt like it took foreover to finish the movie.<br /><br />The bottom line is that I can't recommend this movie and I wish I had watched something else, though I recognize that some people may be able to focus on the positives enough to enjoy the movie.
B003YP0BI4|5.0|I'm a long time Maiden fan, and by long time I mean I bought Somewhere in Time on the day it was released.  So to say I rate this five stars is truly saying something (5 stars meaning I love it, not that it's their best album ever).  This album is simply phenomenal, and not just compared to post 2000 Maiden albums, I comfortably put this in the same league as Seventh Son of a Seventh Son and Somewhere In Time.  Not better, or equal to, but in the same league.  I won't go track for track, because honestly this album isn't about that, and that's where some of the problems arise.  This album is dense, almost too dense to fully appreciate.  I listened to it eight times over about 4 days before it clicked for me.  During those 4 days I went from \\"meh\\", to \\"hmm\\" to \\"I love a few of these songs\\" to \\"this album is amazing!\\".  Now I listened to it probably 15 times, and it sits above Dance of Death and AMoLaD comfortably.  So put aside about 5 spins before you make a judgement...it grows on you until it just suddenly clicks.<br /><br />There is no filler here...each track sways and winds into the next in seemingly endless waves of melody.  The guitar work is tops, and Bruce is in vintage form (even if his voice isn't quite as dominant as 20 years ago).  Interestingly, when I first heard El Dorado on its own when Iron Maiden released it early, I thought it was incredibly boring.  However, in the context of the album, it's great and fits perfectly.  And that's one of the pluses for this album; the sequencing is spot on.  I can't imagine any song being slotted differently than it is on the album.  What this means of course is shuffling this album is a no-no until you've fully absorbed it.<br /><br />Favorite track: When The Wild Winds Blow, The Isle of Avalon, Satellite 15/The Final Frontier<br /><br />Least favorite: None
030745455X|3.0|I found the first book to be interesting but very cluttered.  So much time was spent trying to keep track of the Vanger family that it became a distraction.  The payoffs at the end were somewhat redeeming, but one senses this author needed a better editor.<br /><br />This book, like the first one, could be about 200 pages shorter.  As many have complained, often the author goes into needless irrelevant detail trying to set a scene--do we really need to know what somebody ordered at McDonald's?<br /><br />This book, as well, churns along slowly for about the first 200 pages or so.  If you liked the first one you certainly won't be disappointed by this, in that obviously the main characters are there, picking up where Dragon left off.<br /><br />But when the action gets going here it REALLY gets going, to the point where I read the final 250 pages in one sitting.  The big reveal here--who is Zala?--was done nicely and never telegraphed; far more satisfying than the Silence of the Lambs-ish twist at the end of Dragon.<br /><br />So yes--a slog in the beginning but the slam-bang ending made up for it.  A solid three stars.  A good summer read, but not something I'd read again.

B002ZG98C8|5.0|For those of you who enjoy Grindhouse films, there is no real need to read much further than this first sentence.  Just drop me a helpful on your way out the door, because you need to watch Machete NOW.  For those who need convincing...<br /><br />Machete is a brilliant display of exploitation, actually a subgenre of grindhouse films called Mexploitation that celebrates Mexican life while dealing with drugs, crime, sex, and money.  Initially just a humorous teaser between [[ASIN:B001F0TM5S Planet Terror]] and [[ASIN:B001F0TM5I Death Proof]], a combo from Robert Rodriguez and Quentin Tarantino, the story of an ex-Federale nicknamed \\"Machete\\" seeking revenge just had to be made as an homage film.  The result is undeniably entertaining.  The combination of incredible action without the dreaded shaky-cam, off the charts sexploitation, several humorous bits that heavy-handedly lampoon the incessant political hyperbole, ingenious use of everything within hand's reach for weapons, nudity or partial nudity from all just about all female cast-members (Rodriguez has never looked sexier and Alba is en fuego)...what's the point, this review could reach Moby Dick proportions if I listed everything I liked.  Needless to say, credits caused audible crowd celebration<br /><br />For gorehounds, this movie will definitely, unequivocally not disappoint.  Ignoring the obvious plethora of decapitations and double-taps that produce enough blood to fill Seaworld, let me just say there is one brilliant scene in which someone gets eviscerated and his intestines are used for urban repelling.<br /><br />The cast is unreal.  If someone had told me before this film that DeNiro, Seagal, Don Johnson, and Jeff Fahey were all bad guys, I would have been floored.  Believe it people, because Danny Trejo holds down the other side just fine with his low-rider Army headed by executive officers Jessica Alba and Michelle Rodriguez (Alba is an ICE agent and Rodriguez is a resistance leader).  The cherry on top is the combo of shotgun wielding priest played by Cheech Marin and hitman for hire played by Tom Savini.<br /><br />Robert Rodriguez is responsible for just about everything awesome in this film, and it's pretty clear he enjoyed making it.  Several portions of the script are hilarious, and I'm still singing the chorus to the titular named song that accompanied Trejo through one of his carnage sprees.  The over-the-top nature of this film is pure gold that comes off as a cross between a Mexican version [[ASIN:0790743752 Shaft]], a low-rider car show, a more violent version of Bronson's [[ASIN:B0000541AN Death Wish]], and Cinemax softcore fun (except the leading man is a 60+ year old ex-con covered in jailhouse tats and coarse, scarred skin).  The only flaw is the political discourse which, contrary to what some other reviewers have mentioned, is far from forgotten or dismissed.  Nonetheless, one speedbump can't stop an avalanche of awesome.<br /><br />I hope the fact that this started as a tongue-in-cheek teaser is inspiration enough to create at least one of the tongue-in-cheek sequels mentioned at the end of the movie.  We should all be so lucky.<br /><br />Jason Elinotgun wielding priest played by Cheech Marin and hitman for hire played by Tom Savini.

0307454541|5.0|Shopping for books to read during a lull, I happened to see this book and it immediately caught my attention. So I purchased the book with the intent on reading it immediately, but found myself continuing to put it off for other things.<br /><br />Finally, I cracked it open and was unable to put the book down- read it during breakfast, lunch and supper and anytime there was time to spare. Immersion was an understatement.<br /><br />Stieg Larsson created characters that you can believe are real- even Lisbeth. Tough, to the point and meaner than a rattlesnake when backed into a corner, she is the anti-hero of this masterful trilogy. Sure, she does things the reader doesn't like, somehow though, I couldn't help but become thoroughly and utterly immersed in her story. I cheered for her, cried for her, laughed at her, and wanted everything to magically be better for her at the end.<br /><br />[[ASIN:030745455X The Girl Who Played with Fire (Vintage)]], the second in the trilogy, is equally adictive. I purchased the Kindle versions of these books and dreaded having to recharge my iTouch to continue reading. Am so glad that these books came into my life- some parts are hard to read and difficult to get through, however, it is one of the best Noir type books ever written.<br /><br />Every character in the book is someone you love completely or hate with a purple passion- but each character is 100% believable and completely developed.  The plot is certainly well thought out and stays on track despite the subplots and everything comes full circle in the final book, [[ASIN:030726999X The Girl Who Kicked the Hornet's Nest]].<br /><br />Each book was more difficult to put down than the last and I wish there was a whole bookcase full of these Stieg Larsson books! Now that I am through, I don't know what else to read.<br /><br />I can't believe Stieg Larsson is gone, never to write another wonderful trilogy such as these.
1572704497|5.0|Just to add my 2-cents' worth, Hugh Fraser does a fantastic job of reading this book for audio CD presentation.  When the roles are convincingly distinguished, and the voice work is more than carefully managed, one sees the theatrical art in the reading.  This was not only a classic whodunit, besides, but one with sufficient clues to mine one's way into the morass - before the epilogue-like confession.<br /><br />Thoroughly enjoyable, and my favorite of all the Christie audio titles (. . . with special fondness for the story of the Blue Train.)

9889979942|5.0|Upon reading and viewing the images of Tiziana & Gianni Baldizzone's \\"Esprit Nomad\\" on Le Figaro, a photo exhibition in Jardin du Luxembourg earlier this year in Paris, one name came immediately to my mind--Tom Carter.      It's neither your highly publicized new Modern China of concrete jungle, the new wave of gold (money) rush and the 2nd world economic power, nor it is your romanticized China in Zhang-yimou's  gold-glazing extravaganza  and seductive women loosely wrapped in lavishing and silky dresses. This is the other side of the China story, the story that you've not yet been told.    Tom Carter takes you to the alley of Beijing Hutong  to meet the young women working in the pre-Beijing Olympic pink-light district; the high-rise building (completely beyond the realm of aestheticism) juxtaposed to the ravished old lanes houses of shattered beauty and buried stories; the daily Salah prayer in a 15th century Id Kah Mosque, a Tibetan Buddhist embarking on a long and painstaking journey to the holy capital Lhasa with nothing but a leap of faith.     It's the portrait of a rapidly developing China, the fragility of a new-born national and cultural identity in the making, the colorful and vibrant landscape of multiculturalism, the shocking contrast of old and new, modernization and the remains of their past, ancient wisdom and certain painful memories. It is a portrait of a people in all its complicity and simplicity.     Tom is very proud of his book. When I spoke to Tom 2 years ago, he told me that his book could be used as educational material, even for school kids. Carter opens your eyes and invites you to witness, even just in a few glimpse of the modern China and its minority cultures from its everyday life to hidden and unusual scenes, from the modernization of Shanghai, Beijing to the remotest corners of Yunn, Kashgar and Qinghai, untainted and still seem to be frozen in time.     Indeed, it's the smile of a Al Ha minority woman (a smile not yet \\"contaminated\\" by modernization, materialism and economic growth?), the luminous eyes of a Uyghur girl that made us realize that it's a culture not lost but found and thanks to Carter, captured by his lenses in this two-year journey across 33 provinces and +800 images.     Under the immense sky, there lies the jaded-green Yamdrok-tso Lake, if you are willing to stay still for a while, maybe you will also hear the rest of the China story and the Portrait of a People.
0765326353|4.0|The Way of Kings is what happens when Brandon Sanderson gives a book everything he's got. He delivers spectacularly on everything he's known for:    The world-building is very imaginative. This world is visually stunning, and it's not just a pretty paint job. The nature of Sanderson's world is different enough from our own to be intriguing, while not so strange that it ventures into sci-fi genre complexity.    The magic system is unique and and well-used. It's rule-based but doesn't require the reader to learn the rules to enjoy the ride. Like Sanderson's Mistborn series, he puts a lot of thought into the various ways that his characters might manipulate such a system.    On the whole, the plot flows very well. There's a lot of forward momentum to it, driving the reader to turn page after page, and it all comes together at the end for a satisfying conclusion (albeit not a complete one... it's a series, after all). Although it ends on a note of intrigue, I wouldn't characterize the ending as a cliffhanger.    Surprisingly, the prose is very well written at times. I consider prose (and dialog in particular) to be one of Sanderson's weak points, as I feel his characters sometimes slip into using the author's voice rather than their own, but there were occasions when the prose was eloquent and almost poetic.    Unfortunately, the novel isn't without its flaws (in my opinion):    Sometimes it took a character weeks to come to a realization that I think more realistically would have taken hours. This is especially aggravating when the character is otherwise very intelligent and has been brooding constantly over this problem. I think this is a case of an author handicapping his characters to suit his own motives.    Sanderson can be verbose at times... unnecessarily so. I wish he did more showing, less telling when it came to his characters' internal conflicts. I also didn't need to know every little detail about this foreign world and its uses of magic (I appreciated about 80-90% of the magic system & world building, with some of the more boring aspects of it being a minor buzz kill). In a shorter novel, this would have been fine, but with epic fantasy novels like this, I think it really helps the readers if the author keeps the novel as lean as possible.    Sanderson seems to have a thing for \\"witty\\" (the quotations means \\"no, not really\\") female characters... Just a matter of taste, but I don't relate to his notion of wit and I wish his women were as diverse in personality, demeanor, and intelligence as his men.    There's also a point in a novel--usually around the halfway mark--where I don't want to be introduced to new characters anymore. I'm comfortable with the ones I'm following, I finally have a good grip on the whole cast, and new ones are no longer welcome. I don't think I'm alone on this... I've heard people make similar complaints with some of George R.R. Martin's books. Not only does Sanderson introduce a few new characters late in the story, their story lines don't go anywhere. Apparently he felt like interspersing some of the next book's threads toward the end of this one rather than waiting 'til the next one. It's an interesting idea, but I felt like those chapters were distractions from the story lines that were already in motion.    Despite my qualms, the strengths far outweigh the weaknesses, and I'd recommend The Way of Kings to any fan of epic fantasy. I'd probably recommend it over Robert Jordan to newcomers (I'm not a fan of Jordan, for what it's worth). While I feel that George R.R. Martin is still the best developed writer the genre has, Sanderson's offerings are very different (more imaginative, less dark), and he's close on Martin's heels, improving with every book.    I'm ready for book two.

I couldn't wait to read the final one.  It was anticlimaxtic at best, and depressing to see good characters go to waste, including the surviors.  I had hoped for so much more. Editors should have seen through this one! I had recommended this series to my 12 year old daughter to read, but I plan now to retrieve the book before she starts, to save her the time and save her dreams! Very disappointing!

The Shield was also an amazing show, but I think SOA just has it pegged with this twisting story....Watch Season 1, and then 2, and you will see why this show is so incredible: I am not a biker, nor know the culture, but this show makes me get absorbed in their world.This season is harrowing, but worth the discomfort to get to the end!

0312370849|5.0|This book was so interesting and written in a way that takes you back in history but then brings you to the present and goes back and forth between the old and current lives. Some of the history is painful, however, it is so well presented!
0439023513|1.0|It became apparent in the second book that this author didn't know how to write a series.  The second book being entirely a filler book.  Major events occur over and over in mere sentences.  Open ended events occur left and right.  Objects that lack meaning are spoken about with no end.  Pointless deaths are described in great detail.  We watch character whine like 15 year olds for the entire book.  Personally I hated the main characters within the first few chapters.  People don't want to read about some self-loathing 15 year old going through puberty.  It's one of those things in life parents hate watching and everybody hates reading.  Don't worry though, it's not just the first few chapters, it's the entire book.    The first book was the highlight of this series and it rocketed down afterwards.  Don't waste your money buying the book.  It's one of the most demented, poorly written books I've ever read.

0739370642|5.0|As everbody knows by now this series is compelling /unputdownable. I got this abridged version and it is brilliantly read. The characters were really well delineated. However going on to to book 2 i wanted the unabridged version because i had enjoyed the first so much. It's a different reader and he's not so good. Some of his accents are patronizingly appauling. I got the unabridged version of the third book with yet another reader and he's also not so good. Why didn't they stick with the first reader, Martin weenier, for the unabridged versions. He was easily the best reader and it is incredibly frustrating that the unabridged readings diminish in quality as the story progresses.

0753801728|5.0|Hopefully, if you are reading this review, under this book (and not under the \\"movie edition tie-in\\" link), you have not seen the movie nor- hopefully- know what the movie is about.  The surprise- the twist- the unexpected dimension that this book takes half way through the story is one of the most rewarding and thought-provoking turns a novel has taken in many years.<br />  It starts off as a typical Older Woman/Younger Man (15 years old), December/May, reads like a male fantasy, memoir. Lots of questions- Why was she like this? what did she do during the day? Why must I ask all these questions?- that have been written by young male characters before.  It is nothing new, but it is well written and the conection between the two characters is alive and believable.<br />  Then, halfway through the book, information is revealed that casts the relationship in an entirely new light.  In the hopes that you do not know what that information is, no spoiler alert here.  It is not contrived or stretching the boundaries of coinicidence, just so you know, and gives the novel an entirely new tone and importance.<br />  Simple, straightforward, brilliantly executed- an amazing love story and an amazing morality tale.
0439023513|3.0|First of all, and in all fairness, I must say that writing a conclusion to such a juggernaut as the HUNGER GAMES series is a thankless task.  And I must also credit Collins with giving this book new and different directions to explore.  For that, I was thankful.  What made MOCKINGJAY good but not great for me was the narrative pacing, especially during the climactic moments.  I also had a few quibbles with characterizations and the way the many scores were settled at the end of the book.  I'll avoid spoilers by speaking in general terms if you haven't read the book -- and I certainly endorse reading the book!  Three stars ain't just gravy!<br /><br />This book focuses not on any \\"games\\" but on the real thing -- a Civil War between the 13 Districts and the Capitol of Panem with President Snow at the helm.  It draws interesting parallels with modern wars and the United States in the sense that it shows the role of propaganda and how the media can be manipulated to froth your constituency up.  Thus, the character Plutarch is asked to exploit Katniss so that the Capitol's propaganda can be usurped by the Rebel's propaganda.  For anyone watching the nightly news, it should give you pause.<br /><br />The reader is patiently carried along as Katniss tries to work her way to the singular goal of personally killing President Snow.  Unfortunately, she must also deal with the leader of her own cause, President Coin, a woman from District 13 (a nuclear state, like the Capitol) who has visions of grandeur or her own (and who knows a valuable chess piece -- namely, Katniss -- when she sees one).<br /><br />The book both takes off and sputters with the climactic attack on the Capitol.  Among the obstacles for Collins are what I call \\"suspension bridges of disbelief.\\"  That is, the reader must be willing to go along (or \\"suspend disbelief\\") with plot developments and I, for one, was not so willing in the methods she used with Peeta, Katniss's love interest.  To put it simply, his whereabouts first and his personality changes second occur a bit too conveniently.  Also disturbing was the narrative pacing.  There are beautiful and realistic stretches where Collins takes us door-to-door and block-to-block as Katniss & Company fight and claw their ways to the center of the Capitol.  But then the intense and realistic necessity of such description seems to be forgotten.  Gaps in time occur.  Major events happen offstage.  Anti-climactic resolutions happen too quickly to resolve plot issues that have been central to the entire book.  And finally, Katniss's last dramatic act is not unforeseen, but rather foreshadowed in a hamfisted way.<br /><br />This is why the book lost a few stars in my estimation, but as I said in the opening, bringing this beautiful series to a conclusion is no easy bear to wrestle.  I recommend the book and the entire series, but believe that some readers may be disappointed in the climax and in the characterization decisions made by Collins -- especially regarding Peeta vs. Gale.  A little more subtlety might have helped on that front.<br /><br />Oh.  And one final word.  When you reach the two-page Epilogue, you may wish Collins had skipped it altogether.  The gimmick here is sadly cliched and done in too many books and movies in the past.  Nevertheless, HUNGER GAMES fans, keep your eyes on the prize!  Three solid stars here!personality changes second occur a bit too conveniently.  Also disturbing was the narrative pacing.

B003V4AK8E|3.0|Been using this for a couple days now and I'm massively disappointed. First let me say, I absolutely love the size and shape of the Pro Elite - in fact it makes my 360 controller feel a little too small now! I'm not interested in starting a flame war about the PS3 controller, but it's simply too small for adult hands, at least mine, to be comfortable for a long gaming session.    Let me say this about the textured grip: while I love the size and shape of the controller, after playing for a few hours the grip starts to chafe and hurt. This may be down to me gripping the controller too tight while gaming(!), so your mileage may vary.     Anyways, the real reason I can't endorse the Pro Elite is because the quality is so cheap. For this price tag I expect good/high quality, but that's not what you get, IMO. The left analogue stick, for example, sticks at places before snapping back to center position, and sometimes remains stuck and doesn't snap back at all. Also, while I like the feel of the trigger buttons compared to the PS3's, the pressure needed to apply is too much and your fingers will hurt after playing for a few hours. While I did not have any performance issues with the controller, overall the buttons, especially the d-pad, face buttons, and trigger buttons, feel cheaply made. Though I will say I like the shoulder buttons on this more than either the 360 or the PS3.    I really wanted to love this controller because the controller on the PS3 is the main reason why if given a choice I usually buy games for the 360. I'll keep giving this a go to see if my experience changes as time goes on, but right now I'm very disappointed.
B000NIWI9K|5.0|I have been familiar with Cosi ever since I can remember. From an aria or two on my dad's 78RPM records to the beautiful Otto Klemperer recording on vinyl and later on to many VHS tapes and then the Gardiner version, although good, started appearing a little jaded thanks to average acting and dramatization.<br />So when I felt I should have a fresh new DVD (sans Eurotrash), I thought I would look up the views of the reviewing proletariat - and thought I would risk buying this one.<br /><br />THANKS GUYS.... Whatever you have stated in all the previous 15 reviews to this is almost absolutely correct. This is the nearest thing that is akin to an un-putdownable book that I have seen. I did not even leave my seat for a snack or a leak... So fresh, and so vibrant in acting and absolutely precise sublime singing and interpretation. I think I will measure any other Cosi by the standard set by this one.<br /><br />Not just period costumes, but sets that are minimal, but bright (and not jungle-jims or abstract pillars and stuff that do not distract,) and bring out the essence of the interpretation. I am also overjoyed that it has been performed by artistes thus far not known to me... maybe they are doing well these days, must look that up now.<br /><br />I would unhesitatingly recommend this DVD to anyone irrespective of whether it is the first ever DVD of Cosi or even if one has all the other recordings of it.
B002RVZV9K|5.0|What I really liked best about this documentary was that its maker really probed these three musicians endlessly about their creativity.  He was dogged about finding their inspirations and their stories from the earliest days.  He unearthed little known facts, which might strike one as trivia at first, but then you realize that without those idiosyncratic tics, they might not be the people they are today.<br /><br />For example, Page went to art school in addition to everything else he's done.  He just couldn't live if he didn't try painting, drawing, graphic design, etc., in addition to everything else he was doing in music. White grew up in a lower class section of Detroit, where he was one of the few whites, in a family of ten kids.  Very few people wanted to play musical instruments in that area.  They all wanted to perform rap.  Yet he had so much musical equipment in his very small bedroom that he had to sleep on a foam rubber mat at an angle on the floor.  The Edge is the only politically motivated one but he is in such a band, U2, with the kids he met in grade school.  He takes us back to his school.<br /><br />The above is just a very small sampling of what the director manages to unearth about these three musicians.  I found it utterly fascinating. One other thing the director did is drop entirely the personal lives of these three as far as wives, ex-wives, girlfriends, children, etc.,  For all we know by the end, all three are single and childless. (I know this isn't true but from other sources.)  This omission was great as there was never the temptation to veer into tabloid fodder with this material.<br /><br />Visit my blog with link given on my profile page here or use this phonetically given URL (livingasseniors dot blogspot dot com).

0439023513|3.0|I loved the first 2 Hunger Games books, but am not as thrilled with Mockingjay.  Much too choppy & strange toward the end.  Doesn't flow like the others.  Some things just glanced over when I feel they could've used more attention.  Definitely a must read if you've read the first 2, but just know it's not as good.
0143038583|5.0|Well written book about the food we eat. Should we eat only organic food? Should we all be vegetarians? The author answers these questions by visiting the slaughter houses and organic farms. It is food for thought and don't expect a pro vegetarian essay. It is anti commercial farming who focuses on the cost the consumer pays at the supermarket and not the costs we all pay for the environmental and health costs attributed to the \\"chemicals\\" and other \\"short cuts\\" used to produce cheap eats. Sometimes shortcuts are the longest way around    And I love the part that corn has played in obesity and in the economy. Corn is everywhere. And did you know that in the early nineteenth century that alcohol consumption was at its highest here in America? So read on and find out more things about the food we eat and how our eating patterns opinions have evolved.

0671434004|5.0|Another great book by Carl Sagan. I expected a great book by the Pulitzer Prize winner author of Cosmos... Carl Sagan ( see my review 5 stars) and I was not disappointed.<br /><br />As an amateur astronomer of 40 years I knew of the famous distinguished astronomer Carl Sagan. All of the basic astronomy used in this great Sci Fi I knew about but I know very little of Radio Astronomy. By reading this book I learned a few tidbits about Radio Astronomy. To me this book was fascinating.<br /><br />We see the central character Ellie Arroway growing up and eventually getting a PHD and becoming a world class astronomer in charge of a huge radio telescope... project Argus. Dr. Arroway leads a team and finds an ET signal originating from near the star Vega beaming to Earth. Project Argus receives a signal of prime numbers and then the The ETs beam back a radio signal received from us of Hitler and the Olympic games in the late 30s. Embedded in the signal is a message of instructions for us to build a 2 trillion dollar machine but there is problems getting the \\"primer\\" message to understand it. Eventually we get the \\"primer\\" and build the machine in the US, Russia and Japan. 5 people are selected to go into the machine ( Dr. Arroway is one of them) and using wormhole technology on double black holes are.....that's enough I wont ruin the book for you. Just to say the famous 5 are threatened to not say what they discovered and let the world think the machine did not work. But it did....! At the end of the book we learn the final message.<br /><br />Carl Sagan was a world class astronomer and scientist that also worked as part of the Viking Mars spacecraft team. One of the things I liked about Carl was his seemingly effortless way of making complex problems in astronomy and science understandable to the general public. That is a rare gift. Many times brilliant men/women can not write to the average laymen complex thoughts in a way for the less educated to understand. Carl was a master at this.<br /><br />This is excellent Sci Fi. Also some real Astronomy and some Radio Astronomy is used. The book reads very well. A fast read. The characters are well established and there is good interaction. As a novice to Radio Astronomy it was great learning a few very, very basic tidbits of Radio Astronomy.<br /><br />Also Contact was a major motion picture from Warner Brothers. I remember seeing the movie and liked it too. The book was just as good.5 stars for a very enjoyable book.<br /><br />Sadly Carl Sagan passed away in 1996. The world misses a great astronomer, scientist and a great man. Even though he never knew of me I considered Carl Sagan a friend who I respected very much.s excellent Sci Fi.

1449389627|5.0|Scott Berkun is a talented communicator. Take a look at his material on Youtube if you'd like some confirmation. A 40 minute talk he gave at Carnegie Mellon is available there for a summary of his views on the subject.    In this updated version of his book on innovation, with four new chapters, he continues his discussion of innovation, what it is, where it comes from, how can it be captured and implemented (or can it)? The book is laced with many examples of people who were considered innovators, who are in some way responsible for what we call the \\"modern world.\\"    The book is written as if it is to be given as a talk, and maybe it came out of his talks on the subject. Since Scott comes from a business background (a history of being a product leader at Microsoft), he tends to focus more on business innovation, on the stories of products that made it into production and were successful. It may have more relevance for people who are working in the business world, in fact many of his talks are to business \\"leaders.\\"     There is nothing here that hasn't been expressed before, but Scott is entertaining, and if you'd like an overview of current thinking and literature on innovation, this is a good place to start. If you'd just like the kernel of truth contained in the book, remember the words of Edison, \\"genius is 1% inspiration and 99% perspiration\\" or of John Ruskin, \\"I know of no genius but the genius of hard work.\\"
B0001WTVUW|3.0|Not bad for a tv movie, back then didnt have movies like this and when it came out it was the talk of the town. The movie was boring to tears though, and beware do not try to talk your kids into watching this,  after them seeing todays technology with all these current disaster films they will laugh at you and simply say it sucks.  So for a sole purpose of watching it for old time sake, its good, anything else, it stinks
0812973992|4.0|I have a lot of friends who read and suggest books to me.  This book was suggested by a number of people and reviewed glowingly here on Amazon and on other websites.  It sat on my shelf for a long while but I finally read it and finished it recently.<br /><br />McCann takes a real-life event--Philippe Petit's 1974 tightrope walk between the twin towers (World Trade Center) in New York--and then weaves a number of different tales about people who saw the walk or crossed paths with the walker (or each other) in some way.  The characters are in the book are from different age groups, races and economic levels, even different countries--a support group of mothers who who have lost sons in the war, a group of hookers and the Irish monk who lives among them and tries to save them from themselves, and the judge who hears the case of the tightrope walker (since he did the walk on the sly, without any permission from the city, it was considered public endangerment at the very least).  Family relationships are often at the core of the stories--the Irish monk and his brother, mother and daughter hookers, mothers who lost sons in the war, and one of the mothers in the support group is the wife of the judge who heard the walker's case.  Like Kate Atkinson's Case Histories, McCann takes seemingly unrelated people and knits their stories together, sometimes having them show up in the same place in the same time (such as the mother & daughter hookers who happened to be in the same courtroom when the walker's case was presented).<br /><br />Unfortunately, I am not a person who sits down and reads for hours at a time and finishes a book in a few days.  I read perhaps 15-30 minutes each night at bedtime, and always have at least 2 books going at the same time, so it takes me a good while to finish each book.  Also unfortunately, this is the kind of book that suffers from a long read.  I think I would have liked it much more if I had read the entire book in 3 or 4 days.  As it was, it felt a little fractured to me...like I was reading a book of short stories instead of a single cohesive story with multiple characters.<br /><br />That is the only reason I'm giving the book 4 stars vs. 5, because there is no doubt that the writing is good.  The writing is, in fact, exquisite.  This, too, slowed down my reading, because I'd hit a passage that just sang out to me and I'd have to stop and let it roll around in my brain a few times, like savoring a fine wine or an expensive piece of chocolate.  As an amateur writer myself, finding passages like that is part of the wonderful gift of reading, and I don't like to rush past them.felt a little fractured to me...like I was reading a book of short stories instead of a single cohesive story with multiple characters.<br /><br />That is the only reason I'm giving the book 4 stars vs. 5, because there is no doubt that the writing is good.

0439023483|5.0|Collins created characters we can root for and care about. She made the reader even care and feel (some) empathy for the villin characters! The action kept you turning the pages to find out what happened next. A very good read!
0440178002|5.0|At over 1100 pages, Shogun is a \\"big book\\" that intimidated me from my bathroom shelf for years, almost daring me to read it. I have learned that the key to reading these large volumes is to take them one page, one chapter, and one section at a time. Remember that Shogun was written for people just like you to read and enjoy, and you will be fine. I took Shogun slowly, generally reading 15-30 pages a night, digesting all of the plots, counter plots, alliances, secret alliances, and outstanding characters as I went. Yes it took me most of this summer to finish, but it is a summer, my Shogun Summer, that I will never forget.<br /><br />An interesting aside here for the historically minded. Toranaga in the novel is based upon the actual Tokugawa Ieyasu, and Blackthorne is loosely based on the actual exploits of sailor William Adams, believed to be the first British subject ever to reach Japan. The events of Shogun lead up to the actual Battle of Sekigahara, a pivital battle in Japanese history.<br /><br />The thing that struck me most about Shogun is the way that it changes ones thinking. Many in the western world are Eurocentric (viewing the world from a European perspective), thinking the Europe of 1600, the Europe of William Shakespeare, to be the pinnacle of civilization at that time. Certainly Blackthorne thinks so when he is shipwrecked in Japan during an attempted circumnavigation. At first he sees the Japanese as \\"barbarians,\\" but as time goes on and as he gains a deeper appreciation for the Japanese and for their culture, Blackthorne begins to think of himself as the \\"barbarian.\\" Compared to Japan, he realizes that the Europe of 1600 is a dirty, often corrupt place with a very different sense of values. Blackthorne learns about honor and the code of Bushido, and eventually becomes a Samurai himself. When he is finally reunited with his men, he is shocked at how unsanitary and ill-mannered they are.<br /><br />Church politics play a big part in the novel.  The Jesuits are the first foreigners to gain a foothold in Japan and use their position to their advantage by controlling trade negotiations between Japan and China, making a fortune for themselves and for the Church in the process. The book brings to light many shocking revelations about the Church and how its work converting the populace in many areas around the world actually contributed to the downfall of many native cultures. It also points out that even though differences between various Christian factions seem large from the inside, when viewed from the outside the differences really are not that great.<br /><br />Great books make you think, and by this or by any other measure Shogun is a great book - truly one of the very best. Do yourself a favor - take the plunge and read Shogun. It is an amazing adventure, will really open your eyes, and will be something you can think about and treasure for the rest of your life.oreigners to gain a foothold in Japan and use their position to their advantage by controlling trade negotiations between Japan and China, making a fortune for themselves and for the Church in the process.

Still with the awesome infusion of supernatural/paranormal elements into the realistic world we all know.  Still with the fantastically angsty, against all odds love story of Grace and Sam.  Only this time....changes are a foot with the wolf pack.<br /><br />BIG time.<br /><br />First, we have the addition of uber sexy, rock-star cool Cole to the pack.  Stiefvater, herself,  recently blogged to say Cole sounds like \\"sex on a stick\\" in the audio version.  Hmmmm....yum yum gimme some!  Cole is one of the Canada wolves created by Beck as part of Shiver's plot. As lost as most, he is looking to escape his fame-laden and drug amplified life in the most dramatic and overstated way.  Man, the layers on this guy.  It'll have you weeping like you're peeling an onion to get to the heart of it all.<br /><br />Of course, his presence immediately means he and Isabel, resident human bitch on wheels, are completely destined for each other. **sings**  loving it!  Can see it splintering off into it's own set of books.<br /><br />The differences between the two relationships Linger focuses on are compelling.  Sam and Grace are still deeply in love, connected on an almost etherial plane.  Where, Cole and Isabel have an amazing push and pull, a will they or won't they, dynamic.  They have chemistry and sexual tension to spare, I tell ya.  But, romance isn't the only thing in the air.  Cole and Sam are almost immediately at odds, each bringing the other's past to the forefront in a profound and and almost tragic way.  They learn from each other but not before ripping some hard earned bandaids away.<br /><br />So remember my comments in my review of Shiver about how I thought it a good idea to have more parental involvement by Grace's mom and dad?  Yea?  Well we get it tenfold in Linger.  Mamma and Pappa Brisbane are making up for lost time by putting their feet down twice as hard.  Overcompensation, thy name is mammy and pappy.  Seriously, think of Grace as being on foot in a cell people.  It's not pretty.<br /><br />I'm hopeful that we get to see some resolution to Olivia's becoming a wolf at the end of Shiver in the final book.  Her presence wasn't entirely missing from Linger, but the references that were provided made me wonder why we didn't get more of that particular story.  I'm sure it's by design and I have full faith in Steifvater's storytelling to know that we'll get an excellent resolution.  It's one of the many reasons I'm already eagerly anticipating the final book in the series.<br /><br />The other reason?<br /><br />The awesome ending to this story.  As was the case with Shiver, I wasn't surprised by the outcome of Linger.  Despite having already heard rumors of the end result we were clearly lead down that path in how the story was told.  By design, I believe we were supposed to know.  I think more than anything it was the how we got there than what the event itself was.<br /><br />So, do I really need to say it?  Like really?  Because I totally will.  I'll totally tell you to run out and get this book.  I'll definitely tell you that it's worth reading right away.  I'll even let you in on the secret that it's (in my estimation) better than the first.  Do I need to say more?we get it tenfold in Linger.

0545123275|5.0|I admit, I was a bit hesitant going in to this book.  I picked it up right about the time the blogosphere was buzzing with the news that this was a book about a girl having an inappropriate relationship (read: sex) with an animal.  There was talk of bestiality and all sorts of things that tend to turn a reader off.  But when several trusted friends blogged about it to clarify the real scoop I rushed right out to pick it up.<br /><br />So.glad.I.did.<br /><br />I loved it.  Sure it had it's pitfalls (as most stories do) but for the most part it was a fantastically angsty love story.  The kind where everyone is fighting desperately to overcome adversity that isn't so plausible in the real world (given Sam's werewolvery) but so fabulous in an otherworldly way.<br /><br />So let me start with the \\"bad\\", and let me clarify that I say \\"bad\\" because it wasn't bad in the \\"oh my god you should never read this schlock of a story because it's so horribly written and plotted\\" way.  Perhaps, even, I should say that this particular element (that I've also seen much discussion of on the blogosphere) wasn't how I would have preferred it to be.  Yup, you guessed it, parental involvement.  Part of me didn't like that Grace's parents were never around, that Sam was free to come and go from her bedroom with so much ease.  I would have liked for them to have at least had somewhat of a clue.  BUT, I also think that there are those kind of parents out there.  The kind that have a high level of trust and faith in their kids, the kind that are so wrapped up in their own lives (work, work, work) that a child is of much lower concern.<br /><br />All this to say, I don't think it was implausible that Grace was left to fend for herself so much.<br /><br />See, that wasn't so bad was it?<br /><br />On with the show.<br /><br />As far as the supernatural/paranormal plot goes I adored how it was all so understated and rooted in what we all know as real life.  The infusion of Sam's history, the geneticism of werewolvery, and how it all infused into how humans live their lives made it feel like there could actually be wolves by winter humans by summer.  I also enjoyed the pack mentality and the dynamics of Sam's relationship with the other wolves.  He was torn between his family and wanting to be with (and protect) Grace.<br /><br />There was definitely a strong rootability factor in the way Shiver was plotted and told.<br /><br />The ending was not entirely unexpected given the journey Sam and Grace experienced but that didn't detract from the book.  In fact, I believe it ended at just the right point to set expectations for the next book in the series.  Further, I think it went a long way towards instilling the ultimate \\"gotta have it now\\" feeling.<br /><br />Steifvater's writing is phenomenal -- she is the very best combination of both shower and a teller.  There was some fantastically lyrical prose in Shiver.  The kind that makes your heart drop into your stomach and tears jump to your eyes.  So very palpable in the way that I could feel so much of what Sam and Grace were going through.  This alone should make you want to grab it and read from cover to cover.<br /><br />In case you were wondering, I loved this book.  I recommend this book for readers young (though not too young -- might be a tad too much for the younger middle grade set) and old.  If you haven't read it yet, go out and get yourself the paperback, it's just released.  I doubt you'll be sorry.humans live their lives made it feel like there could actually be wolves by winter humans by summer.

B000EHSN9Y|5.0|I bought this on Amazon because it was under $10 with shipping, which is half of what it goes for at the Apple store. There was a mix-up in the shipping method and it was sent back to Tech for Less, but the customer service reps were on top of it and shipped it back free of charge. Product looks brand new and works fine. Would buy from Tech for Less again.
0465011047|5.0|I purchased this book nearly two years ago and found the story so compelling and so moving that I've recommended it to many friends and coworkers.  The fact that this story is true and that these types of atrocities continue make the book unforgettable.  You don't have to have an interest in communism, human rights, or even North Korea to connect to this book and to its author.  It's simply a story of incredible sorrow and survival - but it will definitely open your eyes to the lives of North Koreans.  It's a book that will stay with you long after the last page has been read.
0385341008|5.0|The format of the story is told in a series of letters, making it a different and easy read.  In addition, we learn a piece of history about WWII that seemed never to have reached us--about the occupation of the Channel Islands by Germany.  A heartwarming story with delightful characters.

B000IJ79WU|5.0|This is the definite version of the 1980's superman II - Richard Donner Cut. The dialogue is more authentic (Shakespearean). The Best scene was with Reeve and Brando. That was a defining moment of the movie. It was the climax.
030745455X|5.0|The books arrived in the time promised and were in good condition.  I would use this site again.  The price was also very good compared to purchase at a bookstore.
B002ZG977Y|3.0|Did not follow the original movie as I thought it would. I was not expecting a masterpiece, so I was not as disappointed as others. I found it slightly entertaining, but I would rather watch the original. They are both cheesy, but the first one has nostalgia.
0143038419|4.0|The book arrived at the time promised and was in good condition.  After reading this book, I would not recommend it because of how slowly it reads.  However, the site I purchased the book from was very reliable and I would deal with them again.
B0000CDLA7|5.0|Is it DT's best album? No, but there can be only one best, right? Yes it's heavy, but all DT albums are heavy. There is absolutely nothing to complain about with this record. I was actually expecting to hate it after reading all the reviews that complained it wasn't progressive enough, too heavy, sloppily written, etc. So wrong on all counts, in fact, it's clearly one of their more technical and progressive albums. I'm having the sneaking suspicion that critics of Train of Thought stopped listening after \\"As I Am,\\" which admittedly is a pretty straightforward heavy metal song, but does little to foreshadow what follows. Love this album (MUCH better than subsequent release, Octavarium).
030726999X|5.0|This book arrived in a timely fashion and was in excellent condition.  The price was very competitive, so I would definitely use this site again.
B0007TKNIS|5.0|This is one of the best movies I have EVER seen. I immediately purchased the soundtrack right after seeing it. I HIGHLY recommend this movie!
0143058525|4.0|The book was very good in general, some parts better than others though.  But I encountered the same problem as with other audio books. Some of the CDs were corrupted and I had to return the product.

0440236738|2.0|I'm not a book snob.  I'm not above reading garbage books if they keep me entertained...but this book was simply terrible.  I liked other Harlan Coben books such as the Myron Bolitar series, but this was just plain horrible.    First and foremost, the writing is simply terrible.  About halfway through the book, I finally had to stop and check to see if this was his first book.  Quite honestly, it was like something that a college student could have written for his/her first novel.  Didn't this guy have an editor to review this? Everything is melodramatic and simply overblown.  Yes, the hero was in love.  Yes, the hero had his feelings hurt.  Yes, everything the hero thought was true, wasn't.  We got that.  We didn't need a detailed description of his feelings every time there was a plot twist (which happens about every 20 pages).    Next, were the incessant plot twists.  A plot twist or two works well, but when you throw a bunch of ridiculous twists together, it simply makes the story unbelievable.  Why not end the story like this, \\"the family hugged and then a cow fell from the sky and killed them all.\\"  That's pretty much what we got from this author..he just decided to make anything up and throw it in there.  By the time I finished the book, I knew he would throw one completely unbelievable plot twist in at the end (which he did).    Lastly, were the terrible characters. A former neo-nazi that is a millionaire, yoga guru that saves teenagers from becoming prostitutes btw..this former neo-nazi has a black girlfriend.  Ummmm....Really?!?  A wimpy non-profit director/employee that doesn't seem to really have a knack for his job, is completely self-absorbed, rarely goes to work (he doesn't even know about a large donation made to his non-profit) but is loved by all of the people that his non-profit helps? I don't even want to go into the girlfriend...who, by the end of the book is nothing but a saint.    I wouldn't tell anyone not to read this book, its kind of watching a bad accident.  You know you shouldn't look but you keep watching to see if it gets any worse...and it does.  Just watch out for cows falling from the sky.
0307266303|5.0|This was an excellent book, full of tales of both great humor and profound stories.  I finished it in about three days - once you get sucked in, it's tough to get back out.  If you are a runner, it will inspire you to keep running, if you're not a runner, it might just inspire you to start.
B003EYVXYG|3.0|All the critical savagery is unjust.  In this day and age, it's hard to get a decent horror movie and, keeping that in mind, this film is above average.  But I guess the problem is Romero has unwittingly set the bar too high for himself and the \\"experts\\" won't let him forget it.  Come on, give the guy a break.
B00364K6YW|5.0|I purchased this for my son to help him in his Advanced Placement English class in high school.  It helped not only to give him a better idea of what was being covered in the book, but, also helped him develop an appreciation of the story itself.
B002A9OJ0Q|5.0|Very nice CD from A-ha. All songs are very good, you can play the CD from beginning to end.
0789723107|4.0|Like many common sense approaches, the content should have been \\"intuitively obvious to the casual observer.\\" However, I found the content has been overlooked by other approaches to common sense development. There are no earth shattering revelations in the book. However, it made me think about some of the approaches I have taken to web development. This was definitely worthwhile reading!
B003KUSUG8|4.0|I'm one of the biggest Eminem fan and this is one of his best cd.
B00364K6YW|5.0|Loved every minute of it and have watched it over and over again. Best adaptation ever of my favorite Jane Austen book. The acting is superb, the scenery is spectacular and the costumes are beautiful. You will not be disappointed, except when the last DVD ends.
B003TOMAPC|5.0|At long last a movie that lives up to it's name. I watched it back to back two times... stop reading and go watch this fun movie.
0307577589|5.0|I do NOT want these people to leave my world. PLEASE have mercy on us readers and publish the 4th book!!! A total page turner. And what a genius Larsson is! He writes about horrible stuff in a palatable way without watering it down.

B002VECLVO|1.0|Derived from Christopher Isherwood's book, A Single Man (2009), was taken to film by Tom Ford. I am not sure if he read the book, fell in love with it, and decided to spend all his money on a crap movie. Honestly Mr. Ford, please stick with fashion design. The wardrobe, makeup, and hair of course made the actors look incredible, but it feel like the entire film lacks substance. It's like the whole course of the film was a day dream with no real plot, poor dialogue, and no climax. I thought the film was going to get better after the opening. The opening scene was fine, but then the film got progressively slower, and slower. It was depressing. George is a professor who recounts the loss of his lover. During the time he meets a few other men who can't replace, or take George's mind off of his deceased lover. If the goal was to make me depressed, then mission accomplished. The back of the cover says, \\"The story is a romantic tale of love interrupted...and, ultimately, the importance of the seemingly smaller moments in life\\". Smaller moments? You got that right. So much time was spent on presenting pointless scenes: the character staring at something, or someone, or poor dialogue. I felt like I never understood the characters or got to know them. Besides Colin Firth and Julianne Moore, I cannot recall the purpose of the other actors. They were pointless. Colin Firth is extremely boring in this film. His best acting was in the lecture hall, but even that scene didn't do it for me. Julianne Moore played a similar role in Savage Grace, but that film having to do with homosexuality was a lot more interesting than this one. The only interesting part for me of the entire film is the scene where George (Colin Firth) started talking about fear in his lecture, but his analogies were off to me. There are other movies that can capture the hardships of love loss and complexities of homosexual relationships a lot more intriguing than this.
