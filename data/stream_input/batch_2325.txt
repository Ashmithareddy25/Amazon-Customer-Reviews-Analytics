B00B8WXFWE|5.0|As usual, NKOTB does not disappoint. I've been a fan since 1988 when I was 8 years old. When they broke up years ago, I never gave up. I was giddy when they came back in 2008. I love their music and love this new album. Even my NKOTB hating husband likes it ;)
B008C20TDG|5.0|This book changed my life! I've always been a very active person and ate very well. But with a few changes to my diet, I have seen the most amazing changes! I've never had so much energy! love it!!!
B00B6QXN56|5.0|This cd is a must for the Bonamassa fan, it is so wonderful and his talent shines through in his acoustic performances
B007HACDLK|5.0|I was leary about reading a local author but had heard very good things about Vince Flynn and have been wanting to read one of his novels for awhile now.  I found it entertaining, engaging and would definitely read more of this series of books.  Very good book.
0399156577|4.0|I really liked this book, lots of mystery, kept you thinking.  made me think about if I left patterns someone could follow.
B00AFEXRME|5.0|This is a great movie.<br />Denzel is a great actor in this movie.<br />Yes I would recommend this move to anyone.
B0055MBQOM|5.0|If you work in the multimedia field this is a must buy. This tool will give you accurate color rendition this is really helpful if you work in Illustrator/Photoshop and want to send your work out for print etc.<br /><br />Highly Recommend !!!
1582701709|5.0|Love it. Especially the first couple of chapters. Do not watch the movie, it's awful and ruins the book. The beauty of the book is that it's captivating and persuasive.
B008B3GP2A|3.0|A number of the songs sound too similar. It sounds like you are listening to the same song all the way through the album.
B005DI9HPI|5.0|Her adventures are a bit hard to believe but are inspiring at the same time. It's hilarious, and reminded me of the beauty and potential in New York City. If you're a girl in your 20's living or visiting NYC it's a must read.
0316017930|3.0|The best thing i loved about this book was the idea of the 10,000 hours. That part made so much sense and I have seen it said over and over again by successful people.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|I love my little pony but the game wasn`t working right, I had to delete it.  I don`t think it right I had to start all over again. I put a lot of hard work in it. About 3 months.
0671646788|5.0|It makes you really think outside the box and to pay attention to even the smallest things in your life. I have a couple of things in it that I have memorized and use everyday. It has definitely changed my values and priorities in life. I'm more focused on what helps me get closer to achieving my goals each day
B004EPZ08O|5.0|Final Destination 5 was a lot of fun. It had a great beginning. I thought it was better than the first. The Final Destination franchise movies have all been pretty good in my opinion. I saw this in theaters and I found it to be very suspenseful. I think if you are a fan of the series you won't be let down. I think this Final Destination was about the same as the three previous sequels with Final Destination 2 maybe the better one. The acting was decent and I found it to have some parts that were scary. I never found the movie to be boring. The movie was exciting and moved along at a good pace. I found the characters to be well developed. There was a blend of good and bad characters which is good. The two leads were likable and that is important in a horror film. I recommend to any new horror movie fan and true horror movie fan. Cheers.
B009KEN87O|4.0|it brings me back to the good old arcade games that I used to play. would recommend it anyone thar likes arcade. games
B007HC3LHS|4.0|Good read, took me a sec to realize what was going on at first (author keeps switching back from past and present events the whole book) but it was very entertaining, and would recommend. Not to mention I only paid $3!!
B0000TB01Y|5.0|I have always been a fan of musicals.  This sound track is now one of my new favorites.  I saw the play a year ago and still enjoy listening to the sound track.
0316056898|4.0|This book is very humorous.  There were several parts that I was literally laughing out loud.  This is the perfect book or someone who is looking for a light interesting read.
B002N44XSG|5.0|It is a great book. It really made me think about the best series. It will remind me of Percy Jackson.
B0019M068O|5.0|on this one...competition closed for all time, the mold was broken and destroyed.<br /><br />As soon go kindle fire with snow, as seek to quench the fire of love with words.<br />William Shakespeare
B00BLGZDVS|3.0|All the parts of a great movie were there - acting, writing, messaging, cinematography....but it added up to a series of brilliant scenes without a consistent storyline. The characters were interesting, but they did not evolve in any way, and their backstories were not explored, so it was hard to understand why they related with each other as they did, and even harder to care.  Still, it had moments of excellence that hinted at the movie it could have been.
0205632645|5.0|Indispensable reference.<br /><br />Words without thoughts never to heaven go.<br />William Shakespeare<br /><br />Better a witty fool than a foolish wit.<br />William Shakespeare
B007ZGBZHE|3.0|I generally appreciate the writing. However, there's only so many times a rabbit can be magically pulled out of a hat before it gets tiresome. Pendergast's miraculous survivals and winning against all odds after all these years become less and less believable.<br /><br />I did appreciate the detail of this book which were based on reality. For example there is a brazillian town with a similar name which was settle by Germans that has a very high incedence of twins.
B00AMBK0X4|2.0|Overall this movie had a very interested premise that was at least partly a new idea. This in combination with a decent cast and the rave reviews of those I know who have seen it had my expectations high. However I was let down by a poorly executed slow moving storyline that in the end did not payoff.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Loved this sequel. The characters get less extreme with every sequel to 50 shades. Worth sticking with the series to the end
B00APUQRPC|3.0|It was a ok movie.  Glad I rented it and not paid theater prices to see it.  Justin Timberlake is pretty good in it.
B00571F26Y|2.0|I'm not sure this book is factually correct.  He blames everything on wheat and even other grains. The last half of the book is just rote diet book.
B0084AXZK0|5.0|First of all, it was free.  That's already awesome. It was a great read; an easier classic than many.  It definitely made me a fan of Oscar Wilde.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|love the way my brain starts to see the patterns. this is better than most games i have played while recovering from survery.
B0013LL2Z2|3.0|It is dated now and the set looks like a shopping mall, it was I guess. But it is OK to see once in a while. Funny clothes and hair, well it was the 80's..
B00AIUUXHC|4.0|I like the game but sharks cost to much money!!!!!!! I'm stuck on the hammer head shark trying to buy the great white shark!!!!!!<br /><br />PLUS My dad got to the great white shark it's just not fair!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br />Why not make the sharks cheaper?????????<br /><br />So like I said you might like it and you might like it OK
B007L24T52|5.0|Another great Baldacci read to get lost in. Yoicks, it seems Amazon want verbosity instead of a simple truthful observation.
B004I2K4DY|5.0|Amazing cast....spectacular production!!!  I believe the music surpasses that of the movie...I have recommended it to several friends.....very enjoyable..thanks  R.B.O.
B009YP9L7U|3.0|Typical romance Mills & Boon type read. Yada yada yada got ten more words to go in this review - bye.
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|I can't start playing this unless I have nothing else to do or I tune out and play forever, sigh!.
B00BESM14U|5.0|It was a very sentimental kind of movie. There were some twists that were never expected. I actually watched it twice within 24 hours. I really appreciated this movie and the message behind it.
B008JMKN4Y|4.0|After reading the reviews for this book I was a little hesitant to read it with everyone going on about \\"abuse\\" of this and that; I was waiting for Travis to be a bastard and hit her here and there...well I think I may have read a different book than all of you because the \\"abuse\\" that I read was Travis basically standing up and protecting Abby.  Travis is a WAY Alpha male and doesn't like people talking, looking at wrong or hurting what he see as his.  Abby is his - he's said it, she's said it, America's said it and so did Shepley!  I enjoyed this book with its strong characters - the best friends were awesome - and all that sexual tension!! Wow!  I look forward to reading Walking Disaster and \\"seeing\\" the way it all went down from Travis' POV because really WOW who wouldn't want to know what goes through his head!
B00AF6MF9I|5.0|This is an excellent free app that I would recommend to my friends in a heartbeat. It has decent graphics and addictive gameplay. The best part about it though is it doesn't beg for your money. You can earn everything yourself, unlike other games similar to this one. It is definitely worth the free download.
B007VUCAVO|5.0|Provides lots of information and so easy to use.  Check out the graphics.  Love this app. Try it out  I think you will be paying for prp version  It is that good.
B000U6BT40|5.0|Anyone that enjoys a great comedy, strong characters and absolutely phenomenal gadgets will thoroughly embrace this new series on syfy.
B00BI5IXL4|5.0|Les miss is one of the greatest movies I have ever seen.  Saw it multiple times in theatres and it's just as good at home
B009IEXKXI|5.0|Just a great, great story. The author really knows his tech. I have been reading science fiction for over 40 years and I tell you that this is an amazing read. Please take my word for it.
B0052CK5PQ|5.0|Finally someone speaking some sense! I am so glad Caitlin Moran wrote this. I can't remember the last time I laughed so much over a book.
B002GHHHL0|5.0|THIS MOVIE GIVES YOU,TERROR,ACTION,EATING, AND THE FEAR OF EVER STEPPING NEAR THE WATER AGAIN! This movie takes place in a giant aquatic Alcatraz, housing sharks SMARTER THAN PEOPLE! This movie is filled to the top of the tank with underwater terror, flooding tunnels, and shrinking the survivor list, one by one! This is definite like, at the TOP of all shark movies!!
B0084U0IEG|3.0|I read the whole book but to me it was just not what I expected.  I read lots but I found myself having to go back and reread to see where I was.  That lets you know that it just could not keeping  my attention.  Too many things going on that just did not tie together quickly enough for me.
B0055PGUYU|5.0|Well written, informative, and filled with practical information about the habit cycle. Great use of interesting examples. Useful for personal, business, and leadership applications.
B0084B5TK8|5.0|In this time, in which you can find a vampire book at the drop of the hat, it is clear that Stoker's Dracula is still the cream of the crop.
B00C1BU7V8|4.0|Enjoyed the movie's take on the insider politics leading up to Lincoln's legacy.  Some facts, some speculation... just wonder what things will be like another 150 years down the road and what they'll have to say about this era's wars and the politics which led to them.
B000N2HBSO|5.0|Excellent and a great read for those who have see the movie. I would recommend the book to all who love history.
B005G4TJUC|5.0|Excellent shipping, price and enjoyed watching this on movie night with my family.  Look forward to the next movie to come out.
B004J4WNL2|5.0|Being an introvert I fin ally found a book that affirms me.  I always thought introverts were &#34;less&#34; than extroverts.  This book is worth the read for all those introverts out there.
B001HN6918|3.0|This is fun but not as amusing as the first one.  Even my grandsons,age 2 and 5 don't ask for it often.
B00AZL3PBK|5.0|I love this game!! U can't play mario on kindle so this is a perfect change its just like mario only a bit different...there's only one thing I don't like...if you hold down the buttons to long they let go and Lep will not be contorable unless you hit the button again and same with the up button it can sometimes mix with the pinecone button if you understand what I'm saying..anyway the overall is I love this game and just keep adding more updates!! Thanks!!
B00BSBY38A|3.0|It is beautiful visually but the story is kind of ho-hum. So if you want to watch something pretty, go for it.
B00BP29SAA|5.0|I absolutely love this game but i wish you could punch in how much each item is  anyways keep on updating..thanks!!
B001ANSSDC|3.0|It just seemed rather shallow. I was disappointed because it was a nominee for an Oscar and the 2 leads make really good movies but it didn't quite pack the punch i had expected
B003Q6CUAI|5.0|Well worth it, with lot of good info.  Love this diet and it works. Once you start, sticking to it is easy
B009KS4XRO|5.0|Like the Bingo Blitz , I used to play Big Fish but it is gone as we used to know it
B004SBS8LA|2.0|I do not care for a game that you cannot play without having to keep spending money just to finish the game!
B0094BB4TW|5.0|Facebook seems to be the top game on the web at this time and I love playing it and seeing what others are up to.
B0018QQQK8|4.0|Good book really enjoyed the reading of this book. The ending was a surprise so I enjoyed that also. Yay
B002D0L0R2|5.0|John Travolta is a stitch.  My husband and I saw the play on Broadway; the movie is NOT a disappointment.
B009X01FJS|5.0|The color is great .When I have it in my bag it is easy to find.I also like the sleep mode feature.the price was great .
B008FYZIVY|5.0|Can't get enough it.  One of the most brilliantly written and acted series I have ever seen.  Love all the characters.  All of them are so important to the show.  Can't wait for season 4.
B00846WWVM|4.0|I like it it's fun little people and stuff put out fires which by the way my name means Fire but yeah it is fun u should try it
B005Q1W10A|5.0|I borrowed my sister's DVDs and broke the Christmas edition of Season 2.  I bought her this one as a replacement and then decicided I wanted my own!  Ordered all 3 seasons.  love it.  Can't say enough about it.
B00ABGEFWC|5.0|Oh I can't help myself I've LOVed LPS all my life there so cute I still have a lot I can't help myself
B0009UC810|3.0|It was entertaining, but would not have bought it had I rented it first.  Loved the duo; I just thought I would like it more.
B008QTV3X0|5.0|Great actors, acting, and story. I was glad I could pause it and ask my viewing partner a couple of questions at the beginning to get oriented; it moves very fast and there was some terminology I wasn't famliar with. But it was worth it. The show lives up to the hype.
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|Yes, yes, yes.  LOVE Downton.  So glad I waited for the 3 to be released together.  And by opening a credit card with Amazon, I saved a bundle.  I have introduced DA to SEVERAL of my friends and they all love it too.  Can't wait for Season 4 in January 2014.
B000FBFMZ2|1.0|I rarely stop reading books part way through, but I couldn't continue with Altered Carbon.  The writing is a dreadful imitation of the noir style, with sentences that clunk and burp, filled with superficial and unsatisfying details.  The central character is a juvenile's sketch of an action hero: utterly without personality, banal and psychotic.  The minor characters are so unconvincing I wonder how much life experience the author had before putting them to paper.  I recommend well-read adults avoid this in favor of all the much better science fiction out there.
B004J4WNL2|5.0|A great read for any leaders or anyone in a management position. Also just a good look into ourselves as well as our peers.
B00BHMETKC|4.0|In an ensemble cast, it's easy to confuse characters, let alone the actors portraying them. I was impressed with the acting of the ensemble as a unit. They each brought another point of view to the table, and the film is better for this cast. The suspenseful moments make me recall similar ones in &#34;Midnight Express&#34;.
B0032CVAQQ|4.0|I enjoyed the laid back text and style. Should be a must read for all engaged couples in the church. This info could transform so many different types of relationships...even pastor to flock relationships. If you are ever in Alabama, we will be there to hear you speak, Gary.
B001QOGYBI|5.0|It's great for the kids, Clooney's voice is perfect as Mr Fox and that crazy animation - cracks me up! This is a great addition to my library and I like to watch it when I want some soothing amusement.
B0049P1VHS|5.0|Just throwing in my two cents here, so to be brief. I'm not the kind of person who usually sits down and watches a series unless it's one of the best things I've ever seen. What would it be like if there was a zombie apocalypse? The Walking Dead in my opinion is the best representation thus far. If you haven't seen it.. Rent it, buy it, or watch episodes here  (  Watch32.com ) Season 1. This is something you don't want to miss! Like I said the only other type of shows I watch are DBZ, Samurai Champloo, Trigun, basically anime, but this is the first live actor series that caught my attention and has been more than a pleasure to watch. Plus it contain moral situations and scripture (not degrading stuff found in most horror films) for any Christians out there. Also the profanity is minimum which is another thing I liked.
B005ES0YA4|2.0|I should begin by saying I'm a crocs lover.<br />I bought the same size I always get (with crocs),  these seem to be a half size to small.<br />The only way I can wear them is to flip the strap forward so it does not hold my heel in.
B004KSQN7C|5.0|just being my usual biased self as a britney stan, lol.<br /><br />she's releasing a new album this year so watch out for it!! it's supposedly gonna be blackout 2.0.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|The books in this series get better and better. There is tons of action and the pace moves you right along. The characters each have unique personalities. I love all the humor and wit in this book!  I love reading these books!!
B00BCZU8WM|5.0|all twelve songs are wonderful (and longer than usual, which is great), there isn't any mediocre track that makes you go 'meh'.<br />however, the diverse range of styles present here is only suitable for true music lovers.<br />you won't really like the entire album if you are a person who only listens to a limited few music genres.<br /><br />i love the bonus tracks. the deluxe version is better and more worthwhile than the normal one. buy that instead.<br />i'm also eagerly anticipating for part two of the album in november. can't wait!<br /><br />welcome back, justin timberlake. you have been sorely missed.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I watched seasons 1 and 2 on Netflix and season 3 on Amazon (all in 3 days).  I can' wait for season 4.
B00B99KJR0|4.0|This game is good for about 6-8 hours of entertainment.  The story is laughable, but the game play is solid.  It can be frustrating to try and beat every level with three stars and will definitely extend the lifespan.  I will say that after beating the game with every star I was incredibly disappointed at the lack of anything to congratulate me.  Yes, I need achievements to feel better about myself.  There is no replayability and will be deleted to make room.
B00AFEY354|5.0|The Perks of Being A Wallflower is a wonderful example of the struggles of teens in today's world, and it also depicts friendships, good memories, and love that comes with those struggles in High School. The Perks of Being A Wallflower truly delivers the drama and heartfelt stories of high school and pulls you into the act as if you were there
B009IAIC5I|1.0|The album is six stars, let's just get that out of the way. However, these albums sound terrible as all picture discs do.  I was really hoping their habit of releasing everything on picture disc would be limited to newer releases however, this is not the case.  I listened to one these at a local record store (they were playing one to marvel at how bad it was) and was not suprised at how bad it sounded.<br /><br />Nothing else needs to be said, do not buy these if you prefer reasonably priced, high quaulity vinyl.  Sadly, they will probably never release a decent, new set of these albums on black, 180G vinyl.  Enjoy hanging these on your walls, that is all they're good for in my opinion.
B00AJLHUA8|5.0|After watching Sinister for the first time I new that this was one of the most scariest films next to Paranormal Activity, and Mr. Boogie Definatley keeps you on your toes through the whole movie. If you love horror films with lots of suspense, this movie if for you! I give Sinister a five out of five and recommend it for anyone who loves this film. I would recommend renting first before buying as with every movie, unless you know you'll love it before you even watch it.
B004HWYTP4|5.0|A fun movie, totally entertaining.  A good laugh, lots of fun.<br />Made me feel good and happy after watching it.
B006CHML4I|5.0|Nice watch, my friend wanted a watch with a fabric band and this was the perfict solution, I love<br />Seiko anyway and find they offer very good quality for a fair price.
B0060MYM3S|5.0|I've watched this season several times.  The presentation of the books is so wonderful.<br />It is one of my most favorite shows.
B00992CF6W|5.0|thus app is so awesome I played it so much it is so much fun all the bad stuff that people are saying is wrong I play it so much it use up my whole battery became I play it so much my family always says to get off of it
B001JI72AI|5.0|Enjoyed very much.  A good way to view history, fact and fiction.<br />It was well done the actors well chosen.
B00B2DSK06|4.0|I'd never seen this before I bought it, but my daughter insisted that she wanted to watch it. I usually pre-screen the movies she watches in order to make sure I know what's in them, their messages, and so forth, but with the fit she threw for this one I decided to just watch it with her and it was really good. It was a unique story and well worth the purchase.
B0095P29EG|4.0|I didn't go watch it in the inseam thinking it was going to be boring. Not so. Much better than expected and now hat part two is coming out may just well check it out.
B00258SS72|5.0|I absolutely love this movie! I also love that I don't have to have a disc and can just watch it from the Amazon App for the Wii! That's really awesome ha ha
0061950726|5.0|This book was absolutely amazing! How she got into the minds of what it is like to be an orphan is amazing. I know, because I was one, a lucky one. This is a book you will not want to put down until you are done with it....I read it the first day and will read it again, and probably again after that!
B00BGZ8TVA|5.0|I hadn't even heard of this movie when I purchased it. I was honestly just buying it to see how the Amazon video streaming app on my Wii worked, and it turned out to be a really great movie. I really enjoyed it and the views it shows in regards to religion, but it's not necessarily a religious movie. Definitely recommend watching it!
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I received the dvd in a timely manner and in great condition. Would definately buy from this seller again. Fast Shipping. I really loved this series. I wish they could have continued the show. One of the best shows I've seen in awhile.
B00BMVTTJ4|5.0|I'm pretty sure everyone who liked the Lord of the Rings will have already seen and loved this addition, but for those who haven't seen it: Just buy it! lol It's a great movie and it's got a ton of action, creativity and much more to offer anyone who will see it. It definitely keeps you wanting to watch more. It is a very very very long movie though, so be prepared.
B0070Y46UY|4.0|An unusual and fascinating book - a little hard to get into at first - but intrigueing, leaving you not knowing what really happened - which story was correct?? It was worth reading.
B007FEZQF8|5.0|It is way better than the show. Reading is always the best! Only thing is I wish they would combine the books more like chapters(:
B004WGIXX4|5.0|for low budget movie an excellent movie !  Natalie portman is adorable !  ASHTON KUTCHER CAN  ALMOST ACT and well done movie
B006AZZPCM|5.0|Best Youtube downloader for Android.<br />Smooth running in background.<br />Comes with choices of download formats.<br />Turn around and play it.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|Fun game!  Great graphics and intriguing storyline.  Mini games were good.  Not hard but some fun challenges.  Probably too morbid for the little ones.  Well worth the dollar.
B008CPZNL6|5.0|Best, I read it every day. With all the sections you are interested. News from all over different sources like BBC, NY Times, etc.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I love the streaming of TV it mades watching TV sooo much easier, and a wonderful way to spend the weekend... Additionally I have no problem streaming
B0022F1XW0|5.0|I have always enjoyed Genesis music. Listening to this album brought back the 80's. Phil Collins's voice is distinctive on the songs. This album is great!
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Free flow is a simple, fun and challenging game that will entertain both kids and adults. I highly recommend it!
B007HC3LHS|4.0|If you like psychological thrillers, you'll enjoy this chilling page-turner. The main character, Catherine Bailey, thought she fell in love with the perfect man, but Lee hid a dark past and an even darker personality. After nearly dying from the abuse she suffered at Lee's hands, Catherine tries to rebuild her life in a new town. She fears the day Lee is released from prison, and when that day comes Catherine's precarious new life is threatened. She knows if Lee finds her he will kill her.<br /><br />This novel includes a fascinating glimpse of a person who lives with OCD. This story is graphic and violent, but very well-written. Not normally my cup of tea, this genre, but I couldn't put it down. The narrative toggles between Catherine's past and her present. The profile of a controlling abuser is believable and real; it helped me understand how some people are drawn into dangerous relationships and stay even as their lives and individuality are chipped away bit by bit.
B00BGIC2J2|5.0|This movie was great could relate to it very well. I do hope that they make a sequel Because I definitely watch it.
B0095ZQ36G|5.0|Reminds us all of the values we should strive for. It really opens your eyes as to what WWII pilots went through. I loved this book.
B0097EWK3A|5.0|Graphics were great, story was clear but still held twists, nice to have audible dialogue along with script for play in different environments.  Let's see enigmatis II
B000J3OTSM|5.0|Channing Tatum...enough said!  I ordered it because I just like looking at Channing Tatum and he seems to be a realistic actor also.
B00873GRU4|4.0|A very enjoyable read and just how possible is this? Great characters and unexpected twists for the reader who likes to escape reality.
B0084TWN9K|5.0|Alice Munro's stories, set in Canada but universal, are the kind of fiction we read and think, &#34;I could do that.&#34;  But of course, no one but Alice Munro can.  The surfaces of the stories are deceptively quiet; there is no movement toward some clear revelation.  It's the mesh of character and setting that is so totally convincing that we enter the world of the fiction and stay there long after we have finished the story.  Most short stories are closed, tidy, small (short!) affairs.  Munro's are open and whatever the page length seem huge and expansive.  If I could explain her power, I'd be writing something else right now!<br /><br />In this collection, &#34;Amundsen,&#34; &#34;Pride,&#34; and &#34;Train&#34; may be my favorites.<br /><br />Only Chekhov and Flannery O'Connor come close to Munro's achievement, and her body of work far exceeds theirs.  Explore her other collections from a long career.  At 81, she is one of the world's greatest living writers.
B004H1V5RU|5.0|Addicting!  Ended up getting 3-4 of the Epic and the Original Perplexus for friends and family for Christmas - everyone loved them.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This app is one of the best apps for the Kindle. I loved it so much...it was money well spent.
B00AJER3SE|5.0|The 1080p remastered picture works well for this science fiction classic. James Cameron, Titan of science fiction brings a lot of variety to the genre, & Arnold Schwarzenegger carries the journey with ease..
B004UA8D2S|5.0|I have heard a lot of negative reviews on this movie, but I cannot say enough good about it. The cinematography was excellent and the underwater scenes spectacular. Without giving away the story I can say that I was able to get something from it each time I watched. If you think you have a strong spirit and personality, you should see this movie; it might change the way you look at life. Richard Roxburgh did a stunning job in his role; you knew what his character was feeling even though he did not let on to it. It takes an exceptionally strong leader to do what must be done, even if it goes against your very nature. Well written, a spot or two where the acting was a little rough (not Roxburgh or the actor who played his son) but all in all a great movie. I would not recommend for children under 13 and even then be prepared to explain why some things have to happen the way they do, especially during extreme and life and death circumstances, but also because of some extreme peril and violence.
0811879542|5.0|The children in my class love this book. We could read it over and over. I loved it so much that I also ordered it for my grandchildren.
B002U5HKZ6|5.0|This is my favorite kind of book - it just picks you up and takes you on an amazing journey.
B004R6JG7Q|5.0|Back during the cultural 60's, three of Hollywood's biggest stars made high-budget racing films:  James Garner, Grand Prix, 1966, Formula 1; Paul Newman, Winning, 1969, Indy cars; and Steve McQeen, Le Mans, 1971, sports prototypes.  As a young man I saw the all of them at the theater and have seen them many times since.  In my opinion, Le Mans is the best of these three great films and the best racing movie ever made.  I also think it survives better than its competition in terms of appeal to modern viewers.<br /><br />The plotlines of all three were criticized as being thin, even as it was acknowledged that any plot at all was just there to distinguish the film from a pure documentary.  The plotline of Le Mans is the thinest of all, but the most tastefully done.  Perhaps because it was the last made, McQeen had gained insight from the other two when he went to make his.  There is a poignancy to it that renders a perfect compliment to the main component, the incredibly realistic and exciting racing action.  Elga Anderson as the love interest is breathtakingly beautiful.  McQueen is at his best, and all the rest of the players are more than competent in their limited roles.<br /><br />I would point out that Garner, Newman, and McQueen were, by all accounts, accomplished racing drivers in real-life.  That said, no actor could have nailed it like the \\"King of Cool,\\" Steve McQueen.  And that's saying something up against the likes of Jim and Paul, no slouches themselves when it came to cool.<br /><br />My only regret is that Steve didn't get this movie done a few years before so that my beloved Ford GT40 could have co-starred with him.  That would have been the ulitimate!<br /><br />If you're a race fan and/or have a home entertainment center worthy of it, Le Mans is a must-have for your collection . . .
B004SBS8LA|4.0|Good little popular game to pass the time. Doesn't do the fling and kill thing the best of any game, but it's hard to argue with it's popularity and wide theme appeal.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|If you love zombies and drama, you need look no further.  The best part of this show is you can never predict what is going to happen.  I own every show to-date and enjoy watching them over and over again.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|All the hype about this trilogy is true! I am NOT a reader. At all. But on a whim bought this trilogy on sale... And finished all three withing about 4- 5 days. Which is saying a lot for someone who never reads and has 2 jobs! So awesome!!
B004SJ3AXI|5.0|If you love angry birds you will love this one too.  Love the holidays being incorporated in the scenes. Just as addictive as the other versions.
B0067Q42BY|4.0|Really enjoy playing the game. Like the fact that the tile icons change with the geographic location change. It makes it sometimes challenging.
B000ICXQS8|3.0|Not what I had expected in the plot. Some radio station's Dj here in town had made a referance to the movie &#34;BrokeBack Mountain&#34;. And I  had remember the name of this movie so I rented it,  This movies message was clear all threw out , just not what I thought this movie was going to be about.  I just recomend  caution with some views.
B00A757EFW|4.0|Game is realistic, similar to arcade Pacman. Easy to zoom around and doesn't bog down. Of course, I'm not the greatest Pacman player but, I had fun. Ordered it for a Kindle Fire HD, and it had excellent resolution.<br />.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love it but I don't like that we loose energy quick and everything with gems cost so much love this game still and the horse reminds me of my horse got love it
B00BHMETKC|5.0|I very much enjoyed this movie and found myself cheering towards the end eventhough I knew how the story ended.
6305311463|2.0|The movie is what it is.<br />The DVD releases of this film are in the 4:3 Letterbox format. That includes the original 1999 DVD release and the Criterion re-release. Both are in the 4:3 Letterbox format. I suspect the only way to get a 16:9 format is to purchase the Blu-Ray release. Cheers.
1470879085|1.0|When I received item I assumed the audiobook was a playable CD as all others have been.  But when I was unable to play it on my CD player, I read the cover only to discover that it had to be converted to play on an MP3 player.  Since I am  Senior and do not know that technology, I will not be ordering any more audiobooks from Amazon
B00B7FWWNA|5.0|John Hawkes gives a wonderful performance, and what can you say about Helen Hunt, she is my favorite actress, and is also great in her character as Cheryl
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I love this app. It has so many reading plans and devotionals.it also has reminders and you check off completed tasks.I really enjoy it.
B00AYQNOU8|5.0|Visually stunning, Samsara takes the viewer through the sights and sounds of major religions and modern cultures.  The use of time lapse photography brings what we consider &#34;inanimate&#34; things-  (ancient statues,  rocks, trees) to life.  The alienation of modern man through modern technologies in surprising displayed as it raises the question of man's place in the world, and whether we have made progress in comparison to primitive cultures.  Not fast moving, but intellectually engaging and wonderful to watch.
B0013HYLT0|5.0|Great quality.<br />Wonderful music!<br />Our four little boys love listening to Mary on our car rides!<br />Would definitely reccomend this CD!
B00AFOS9I6|1.0|All 21 customer reviews are for the DVD format and not a single review<br /> for this bluray format.<br />I think that costomer reviews from 2001 for a product that was released<br /> on 2013 is absurd
B0060MYM3S|5.0|I love this program. I MEAN LOVE IT!!  I had to have my HBO channels taken off for money reasons & missed all the rest of it!!  I WILL buy the next season. BUY IT. It came in on time and well packaged.
B007ZXK08C|5.0|The book was published in Norwegian recently and got very good reviews,so i ordered it from You to read it in The original language
B008CLI4N4|5.0|I received this on time or before (can't remember at the moment).  I started watching season one and only saw a few episodes.  I had some $ problems so I didn't get HBO anymore due to my having to cut back on expenses!!  I'm totally hooked on this!! I LOVE LOVE LOVE IT!!!! I hope it never ends, but alas, all things due. I will get the 3rd season when/if it comes out too.
B009LMTDL0|5.0|All women need to sit at the table and encourage those who need support to come to the table!  Be there for each other!
B001EC2ISA|5.0|I love this movie but was unaware I was buying it to view on the computer. I need to pay attention.
B0088W6IMQ|4.0|I've always liked the &#34;Stargate Atlantis&#34; series. Now that I can watch it in HD, brings the scenes into clarity that the DVD's or streaming on Netflix did not bring. I hope Amazon will keep having this show free to those of us who are &#34;Amazon Prime&#34; members.
B00111YM5G|3.0|It was an alright movie but for ME, it got kinda boring & half way through I fell asleep. It's okay though.
B009KEN87O|5.0|New spin on old game, very well executed. Tons of fun, great user interface. Fun for kids and adults. Great fun
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|This story is an inspiration.  With VR now an afordable reality (see Oculus Rift) everything in this book could be coded into an accurate virtual reality.  This is an exciting time.  This is one of the best books I've read this year.
B008220C38|2.0|I was so looking forward to seeing this movie.  I love period drama and the story of Anna Kerenina is haunting.  However, this adaptation was quite disappointing; if you had no idea what the movie/book is about you certainly would be lost in avante garde approach to this story.  I had no sympathy for any of the characters.  It was more \\"style\\" than \\"substance\\"...and the style was questionable at best.  There should be a rule of thumb...if you can't make it better than the previous version, don't make it at all!
B005RYF5JA|5.0|I loved this dvd.  Celtic Woman is a fantastic singing group, I listen to their music with my son on the way to work and whenever I'm travelling.
B0057R5XRG|5.0|When I think of the word film, I see Spielberg's face next to it in the dictionary. I saw this film in the movie theatre when I was in middle school, and I was just in awe, amazing special effects, perhaps not on par with all the CG stuff we have today, but you have to keep in mind that much of the animatronics were waaaayyyyy ahead of its time. A great family adventure, no less. Thank you uncle Morty for another great film!!!!
B0091REZMW|4.0|It being free and all its not bad but it seemed to me anyway to be a bit easy. And of course there's always some extra money needed to do certain things.
6301647734|5.0|Jimmy Stewarts favorite movie. I wish I had noticed that it was on tape and not DVD, but it's just as good.
B0070Y46UY|5.0|The Greatest book I have read in a long time.  The story line was so powerful, I could get 'lost' in it, I hated to put it down.  I saw the movie & thought it was so good, I bought he book, after seeing the movie.  The book was even better then the movie
B00BHMETKC|3.0|I was sad to discover that there wasn't much to this movie aside from the true story it was inspired by.  It's a great premise and offers a lot of natural tension and drama, and for that I appreciate them making a narrative from it.  But then on top of that, they chose to make it in this understated way with that shoestring budget aesthetic and it becomes a little bit like, &#34;maybe this should've just been a lifetime movie.&#34;  It didn't help that I wasn't quite sure why I was supposed to have sympathy for the six &#34;protagonists&#34; who were whiny and inexplicably mistrusting of their only option.  And to see the actual performances after their nominations I was sort of like, &#34;eh?&#34;  This was a classic case of overhype as a result of an indie film winning awards by far exceeding its wildly low expectations.
1419702238|5.0|Another exciting book in the world of reading.  A very good book for the First Grade and my son loves it.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is a great game, Its my favorite game for my kindle fire!I recommend that you would like it if you had it.
0810983915|5.0|A very interesting book, my kid loved it and is reading much better now.  Durable with the hard cover, and the pictures make the story very<br /><br />A perfect gift for a First Grader.
B001AQO3QA|5.0|Beautiful transfers. Beautiful collection. I believe that there is another collection available with more memorabilia but this is just fine for those who love the films more than just collecting. The the box itself is lovely.<br /><br />While I'm not a fan of the last film, it was actually cheaper to get the anthology than to buy the three films that I do enjoy. So, I'm happy.
B00004YYDI|5.0|The Netflix version sucks- the longer movie is great.<br /><br />Hey, Jean Reno, what can ya say.<br />Natalie Portman as a sexy 12 year old- Well, what else can ya say.
B00B4VXQC8|4.0|Ok, so I downloaded this album from iTunes, let me state off the bat that I don't own this physical copy, but I want to buy one. I have been a Bon Jovi fan literally since in the womb. They were my mothers favorite, & subsequently became mine. I'm 26, & own every album including the box set 100,000 fans can't be wrong. I adore this band. Adore. I cry every time I see them in concert. Now for honesty. Personally, I think one of their best albums was Lost Highway. it was a departure from their older stuff but I love it. bounce has a few tracks I love, but I don't listen all the way through. Have a Nice Day is their worst. There are two songs on that album I like & still hate it to this day. Not even on my iPod. The Circle I hated at first but now I like it a lot. This one I hated too. It felt like the same formula, positive political driven tracks. Which it is. But now that I've listened a few times, I love it. Give it a chance, is all I'm saying. I love Thick As Thieves, makes me think of my husband, & Beautiful World is catchy. Forgive me, I don't know all the names of th ones I like yet, it's in my car & I don't see the track names. I even think I like it better than Circle. Yes the boys have been following the same formula for awhile now, but don't give up-they still rock & the fact that they haven't left my world yet is enough to be thankful for :-) best band ever!!!
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Could not put these down - moved on to 6-8 and cannot wait for dust to wrap it all up.  Highly recommend.
030758836X|2.0|I loved the beginning of the book.  It was a real page turner and I couldn't put it down.  I was anxious to see how it would all end.  The ending was horrible! I feel like I wasted my life reading this book, just because of the ending. 2 stars because I really loved the book up until the end.
B00AU15HPC|5.0|I Love music, I love the lyrics. I like the alternative version of &#34;Out there Somewhere&#34; Some of the songs pick up where &#34;The View from the Hill&#34; left off. I think it is some of Justin's best work.
B004SBS8LA|1.0|Haven't been able to open it and have uninstalled and reinstalled it numerous times. If any special Kindle instructions are needed they should be supplied.
B005XN2ZUC|4.0|I really enjoyed this series due to the superb acting.  And the complexity of the characters makes them more believable.  I have rarely seen a combo of good and evil characters where all were performed so well and there were so many complex relationships among them.  Rumpelstiltskin is my favorite - he is actually repulsive and appealing almost simultaneously - a very skillful portrayal. I was a little disappointed in a plot turn of last season 1 episode - I won't give it away - but other than that, found it hard to not keep going to the next episode.
B00A757EFW|1.0|this game seriously sucks on my kindle fire so I honestly DO NOT recommend this to somebody with a kindle fire it freezes, keeps for closing, ect so all I have to say is do not get it but it is your choice!!!!!!
B00AEFYX4U|5.0|HD TV display will rip off your face. Awesome. This is one of the most visually stunning animations currently available.
B00785P2QC|4.0|this game is good i like it its ok its fine its wonderful its extrodinary its like a free sim city game i like it i have fun playing it
B0063GORYU|5.0|I like how it's fully automated as compared to a pc version. It's simple and easy. I have no problems with it or against it.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|this is a good game for me  not a lot of heavy mind power involved<br />just some good visual effects
034580404X|5.0|Awesome quality books. They were also wonderful to read and share with friends and re-read. I would recommend these to anyone.
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|I received Seasons 1 and 2 for Christmas from my daughter and after watching I had to have Season 3.  It was so sad but absolutely wonderful.  I can't wait for the new Season to begin.  Even if I watch on TV I will buy it on DVD to have at home.  Worth the money.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|I am loving this book so far! Can't wait to finish it and move on to the next two books
B00ABGEFWC|5.0|it is better than puppies,unicorns. I love this app brand or the creator. I also have the ice age one too.
B0018QQQK8|4.0|I enjoyed this book, especially the last few chapters when I found that I could not put it down.  Worth the read.
B009KEN87O|5.0|great. Lot's of fun and a good time waster. recommend it highly if you want a fun brainless game to spend some extra time. five stars.
B00BFUUMO8|4.0|Like the title says this basically farmville but no crops just dinosaurs. I will say it was pretty crummy of them to make the T Rex only availible if you spend real life money on dinosaur bucks.
B008GJV4F2|4.0|This was rented for my girlfriend, so this is a second hand review as I didn't watch it. She wouldn't tell me how she liked it specifically other than that it was very good, though she wished it had more naughty scenes with Johnny Depp. That's all I know...hope it helps someone. :p
B007OWRBJK|5.0|So worried when I started reading because I have idolized Pete since 1973 and was afraid that he would turn out to be a complete jackass. Although he certainly was at times, the fact that he has a good heart and did not commit the evil deed that made him infamous is clear to any objective reader. Thanks for the memories Pete!
B00BSBY38A|2.0|Really cool computer graphics. But the story and point were like listening to a drunk philosophy undergraduate explain everything. I should know by now to not watch Ang Lee movies.
B004LWZWGA|4.0|I have all the batman movies! This one is totally different. I liked the Batman Begins and The Dark Knight better! Thank you.
B0009P42V4|5.0|this is for a 2 year old that gets bored easy she loves it but i think her mom has watched it more
B00BWJARHO|5.0|People complain it could have been made in 1 movie, but the level of detail<br />is so amazing, it cant be.  Great even if you read everything.
B000V5Y1SQ|5.0|i am suprised at the selection of free episodes with my prime membership its cheaper and faster than netflix and most of it is in hd
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|It does exactly what I need it to and is real handy.  I couldn't ask for more.  Keep up the good work!<br /><br />Thanks.
B001NLKXK2|4.0|Very much enjoyed this heartbreaking story of early-onset Alzheimer's disease and the family it has affected. I don't know if anyone can get inside a person's head once this horrible disease manifests itself, but I found this tale believable and well-done. Kudos to the author.
B004WKH516|5.0|It reflected how a single woman, tries to raise two daughters and give them everything she didn't have. Unfortunately, she gave Veda too much, and she never appreciated her mother, just her money. The ending was a total shock. Veda and Monte used her for what they could get from her. I don't think she cared as much for Kay, as she did Veda.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|I bought this novel to satisfy my curiosity... To find what all the hubbub was about. Figured it would be none stop sex from start to finish... However I was incorrect. The love story is captivating and while there is a lot of hot sex... The love between Christian and Anastasia makes me root for them to win... On to book 2!!!
B00A80SHFM|5.0|A couple of main songs are missing from this CD, but then again... it is the &#34;highlights&#34; so ... if you dont want to buy the whole score (like 40 songs on it think) then this will fit your Les Mes needs.
6300184080|4.0|I really Love this movie, I sent for it and received it quickly and without any problems..  I'm a happy camper
B005LAIIGC|5.0|I love this movie. It tells the tales we've been listening since I was a kid but with a diffrent angle. Love it!
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Great acting, great costumes, great story.  The very first episode is a little slow but once you start, you can not stop watching!
B003VANOFY|4.0|I was looking for a good headset so I could play MMOs on line. The sound quality is very good, and you can adjust it using an equalizer that comes with the Gaming Software you can download from Logitech. Also the customizable keys in the headset are very helpfull. The range is great and the battery can last up to 7 ours. And if you ran out of battery just hook it up the USB stand that comes with it to recharge while you continue using it.<br /><br />If you are looking for a high quality sound to pump that bass out of your DJ Tiesto song... maybe this is not the right product for you. In my case I like the bass the way it sounds :D. I highly recommend this product for games and music enthusiasts.
B000W93CHC|5.0|As the sequel to Pillars of the Earth it was excellent.  Enjoyed reading about my homeland as it was in the 15th century.  Wonderful research.  Thank you Ken Follett.
B005S9EKCW|5.0|This is a great musical made movie. And a great movie it is. You do know they were singing the songs live while they were filming it.. right?
B00BHMEOP2|4.0|I had no idea this actually occurred. All the talk back then was about the hostages. Of course I was stationed in Germany at the time, so there was not that much stateside news. Good movie, well directed supspense thriller.
B004NEY9EW|4.0|Exciting, fun, riveting. All the stuff I like from a Bond movie. I am surprised, Craig is a good Bond.
B003JBI2KM|5.0|I still have not finished reading it, but it is a great book.  I am really looking into homebrewing all grain beer, the bad thing is that I can´t find all the types of hops that they mention.
B00BWJ7LYG|4.0|Great movie and great effects. Not up to the quality of the Ring Trilogy however. Very glad I watched it.
B0070Y46UY|4.0|I really enjoyed the book it was pretty interesting the ending was pretty good. I got lost on some parts but the ending explains it all.
0062200909|5.0|I absolutely love the books, & now the latest movie!! Very nice pictures straight out of the movie! Definitely a nice addition to my collection!
B006R4H5FG|4.0|And that's what I like the best.<br />Powerpoint? Prezi? doesn't matter, this advice is universal to make you presentations and presentation skills better. You'll be able to apply them even in &#34;pen and paper&#34; presentations.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|This series is not only interesting, but educational as to the history of the time and the culture of the English, the beauty of the country, the clothing, the actors all playing the part is outstanding, I enjoyed Seasons 1 and 2 and now am enjoying Season 3 looking forward to Season 4..well done PBS
B0017SWPXY|5.0|Wow, what a great book. I see my dog in a new light. She gets filet mignon every night now.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|As in Season 1 this continues the saga and is so interesting to watch, not only for a historical view but to see<br />the culture of the English people.
B002QBS9KE|5.0|I have had a Plantronics Voyager for about 4 yrs now. I just bought a new Voyager Pro and got these because it's the only part that wears out or breaks! Kind of a no-brainer! Haven't used them yet but will have them when needed!! The shipping was good they showed up a couple days before expected!
B0018QQQK8|4.0|I really enjoyed this book. It's romantic in every level yet kept real. The story in the book is one that can easily happen to someone. Logan is a man that Im sure any women would want. Great read!
B002MQYOFW|3.0|First book was good, kept wanting to read just one more page. Books 2-3 were ok, not as good and left on bad note I thought. Need more information at the end.
B003JTHXOK|4.0|What a book, full of suspense, love, romance and drama. Lots of drama. Kept me on my toes not wanting to put the book down. Love the ending. Wished it provided a little more at the end but it was great.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I needed to catch up on a few missed episodes - great idea to be able to pop on Amazon and get caught up!!
B003O86FMW|5.0|This book picks up perfectly where The Hunger Games story left off. It's a very compelling story and I could hardly put it down. I can hardly wait to  start reading the next book in this series. Very very good book!
B002HWRYJE|5.0|I need to preface this review by saying that I have never seen anything Star Trek related before this movie.  And also, I am a J.J. Abrams fan girl.  I love everything that he has done and this movie is no exception.  Buy/rent this one, you won't regret it!
B002QE3CTY|4.0|This book was truly captivating in all of its in depth description and vivid imagery. The author really took you to a different world. At first I thoughtless book was a little young for my taste. But then as  it went on and the storyline progressed I think the book was geared toward an older audience. All in all this was a great read and really gets your mind going. I can't wait to read the next book in the series.
B00BHMETKC|5.0|We really enjoy this movie. We thought that it was very  well done. The actors played very well as well.
B005KPDAN4|5.0|All the superlatives you may have heard of this show are accurate.  It is irreverent, sardonic, witty, sad, and on and on.  Truly a fine TV experience.
B00A7OIXW6|5.0|Wreck-It Ralph (Two-Disc Blu-ray/DVD Combo) is a great kids and family movie.It's a must see for the kids, they'll love it.
B002JCSWV6|5.0|Well packaged...excellent shape. Fantastic data<br />This movie presents great life situations....packed with brilliant discussion points and is a sensitive approach to difficult life issue.
B000S81MHY|4.0|I had got it in my head this think was bigger than it is.  When it arrived in a tiny light box I very surprised.  My two hands can cover the entire table.<br /><br />Build quality seems decent and I have been enjoying doing some really light milling on the drill press. Cut some holes in a aluminum bar I could have never done otherwise.  Way too light for steel even aluminum seems to be pushing it a bit.
B007712XAU|5.0|Bought Season 1 as a gift for a friend. Currently catching up on Season 2 myself.<br />Enjoying every minute, it's interesting to see this aspect of life in the 1900's. Bought this set based on price and version, I was not disappointed.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I could not put this book down.  The story is so real and fascinating.  I can't wait to start the new one.  Love, sex, possession and revenge and he is filthy rich, you can't get a better story line.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|This is a simply written story but is engaging and lovely.  Easy to read and certainly enjoyable.  Worth your time to read.
B004H8GLXQ|4.0|I stumbled upon this book while looking for a 'Fiction Fix' after having read a few sociological monographs. I am firmly convinced that these two very different genres engage different parts of the brain and thus feed different parts of the reader's psyche. Anyway, I was looking for a classic tale that would invite me in and introduce me to interesting characters. And added bonus would be an interesting plot that propelled me to a startling conclusion.<br />This book achieved all of that. Without leaking spoilers, allow me to say the author created real and believable characters who operate in a somewhat unbelievable realm. But, the suspension of disbelief is easily achieved and paves way for an engrossing and satisfying read. One reviewer stated that once the reader puts this book down, he can not wait to return to it. True. I look forward to the author's next work.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|somehow I missed several episodes and just had to go back and see them.  They were just as good as the rest of the series.
B005FOF3D0|5.0|I suppose tastes in reading are exactly like tastes in clothing or music. Opinions differ. For me, I found reviews that panned this book to be well off the mark. While it is certainly true that not all characters are 'likeable', I can't recall having likeable characters ever to be a requirement for great writing. Franzen's perspective is fresh and his story-telling prowess is highly tuned. I place him in high regard along with John Updike, for example.<br />Of course, that's just my opinion. I urge you to read this book and form your own opinion.
B005XN31LY|5.0|I got into this show late and had to get the early episodes so I understood more of what was happening.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|Awesome books and a great price. Buying it this way saved a lot. I can't wait for the movies now.
B001KDQ4KQ|5.0|A great read!  Well written and captivating.  My first Jodi Picoult and can't wait to start the next.  A perfect \\"quick pick up\\" for the busy lady.

B000068QZK|4.0|1988's \\"No Rest For The Wicked\\" marked a changing of the guard for John Michael Osbourne, and his eponymous solo project. This release might be Ozzy's fifth full-length effort from the studio, but it is his first ever with Zakk Wylde handling all guitar duties. And this was a very wise move on Ozzy's behalf, because no offense intended for axeman Jake E. Lee, who handled lead guitar for Ozzy from 1983 to '86, but if there is one guitarist who is worthy of taking over for original six-string virtuoso Randy Rhodes (who died in a freak airplane crash in 1982), it is Zakk Wylde. His guitar licks are delicious, and his solos are just plain dazzling.<br /><br />\\"No Rest...\\" might feature three fairly popular singles in \\"Miracle Man,\\" \\"Crazy Babies,\\" and \\"Breakin' All The Rules,\\" but it does not have any real, genuine classics. Regardless, it does have many a song that is well worth your time and attention if you are a hard rock or heavy metal fan. They are songs that are easy to see becoming staples in Osbourne's live set.<br /><br />\\"Miracle Man\\" is a strong and propulsive set opener backed by chunky, industrial-strength, and at times almost chainsaw-fast riffing. But the tune's really catchy vocal patterns, including the use of some robotic-sounding vocals, and totally ripping guitar solo cannot go unmentioned, either. \\"Devil's Daughter (Holy War)\\" follows this up by marrying propulsive, tasty, chugging guitar hooks and wailing soloing (fro m Zakk) with an ominously grumbling bass line and more really memorable vocals (including ending with some of Ozzy's trademark maniacal laughter). But track three, \\"Crazy Babies,\\" is perhaps even catchier than any of the above, seeing how it is a hit single, and does feature a catchy, lurching beat, sludgy, distorted bass lines, and a chorus that will rattle around your head for a nice, long while. And the next song, \\"Breakin' All The Rules,\\" is the last of the album's singles. Therefore, it, naturally, is also a big standout. It features terrifically rhythmic, toe-tappable rhythms, and a smart use of the wah-pedal, including uncorking shredding, air-guitar-worthy solos that fly all over the place.<br /><br />Next up, after a rather disturbing and unsettling intro, \\"Bloodbath In Paradise\\" settles into a propulsive groove tattooed by fiery, deft, crunchy riffing. But this song is immediately overshadowed by what comes next: \\"Fire In The Sky\\" is an excellent album centerpiece with a fairly epic scope. Its verses are fairly docile and restrained, with low, humming bass lines, acoustic guitar flourishes, and even (what sounds like) a keyboard or two; but its choruses, which find Zakk storming onto the scene with his commanding electric guitars that lumber their way out of your speakers, are much louder. As such, a terrific contrast is established, here. But then, the subsequent \\"Tattooed Dancer\\" works differently, as it is a completely heavy and ripping song propelled forward by blistering, nimble-fingered, and borderline thrash-inspired riffage.<br /><br />Moving right along, \\"Demon Alcohol\\" is a catchy, driving, and muscularly chugging song with irresistible vocals and choruses. It unleashes another killer and towering guitar solo, too. The proper end of \\"No Rest...\\" comes with the next song, \\"Hero,\\" which is a near ballad, although it is one with crunchy guitar hooks and wild -- ahem, Wylde -- soloing from Zakk. But if you buy the 2002 reissue of the album -- and you definitely should! -- you will be treated to two bonus tracks. The first of which is entitled \\"The Liar,\\" a somber and moody, piano/melodic strings `n' all power ballad that is very decent, even if it is somewhat predictable and familiar for the Ozzman. And the second track is a blazing-fast live rendition of \\"Miracle Man.\\" It does not make for quite the touching ending that \\"The Liar\\" did, but it does kind of wrap things up nicely, as it closes the record by going back to the same track that opened the album.<br /><br />\\"No Rest For The Wicked\\" is a very solid album, and a consistent front-to-back listen. Also, it is a record that very few fans will have issues with. It is not, however, a classic that ranks up there with, say, \\"Blizzard Of Ozz,\\" \\"No More Tears,\\" and/or \\"Down To Earth.\\" It is a good Ozzy Osbourne album, just not a great (or even upper-tier) one. But does that mean it is not worth buying if you are a fan? Absolutely friggin' not!r The Wicked\\" is a very solid album, and a consistent front-to-back listen.

B00BC0JI6O|4.0|Almost a decade after releasing their first effort without Neal Morse singing vocals, the Beard is back, breaking in a new vocalist (and a new drummer) to fill in for the departed Nick D'Virgilio.<br /><br />Stepping up behind the microphone is Ted Leonard, who has a vocal style that is very different from either Nick or Neal, but who has a fair amount of \\"prog\\" cred from his tenure with Enchant, as well as on various side projects (Xen, Thought Chamber and most recently, Affector).<br /><br />I love Enchant, so when I heard Ted Leonard named as Nick's replacement, I was hopeful that this would provide a chemistry that would click. Jimmy Keegan, who had been their drummer on tour for years, was a no-brainer.<br /><br />But could the band weather another change in lead vocalist?<br /><br />More importantly, would the band be able to write songs and craft an album that would hold together with their back catalogue?<br /><br />Yes on both counts.<br /><br />I thought the previous album, X, was the band's best effort since V.<br /><br />The fact that the new CD, [[ASIN:B00BC0JI6O Brief Nocturnes & Dreamless Sleep]] was not titled with a Roman numeral left me a little concerned, but while I would still rank it below both of those titles, that does not keep the album from being a fine slice of prog and a worthy addition to their canon.<br /><br />This album is an excellent effort, with well-written songs and creative arrangements. The band are tight, with Jimmy and Ted sounding like they've been in the mix for years.<br /><br />The songs do a good job of taking influences from each of the band's two prior eras, and are full of progression 'twists' and big endings.<br /><br />The second CD (with one bonus cut if you ordered from the band's pre-order campaign) is short, but the songs are good, and overall, this is a quite solid effort.<br /><br />Recommended.

0062014536|5.0|Warning!  This review will contain spoilers for Delirium, Hana, and Pandemonium.  Please proceed with caution if you have not read the listed books.<br /><br />It's actually been awhile since I've read the last book in a series.  In fact, I've consciously put off reading 2 books that I own because they are the last books in their respective series.  It's always hard to say goodbye to a series that you love, but unfortunately all good things much come to an end.<br /><br />Requiem is the third and final book in the Delirium trilogy.  This series captured my heart from the very beginning with the first book.  I guess it's kind of ironic that a book with a premise about a world where love is illegal caused me to fall desperately in love with it.  I was impatiently waiting for Requiem to come out, and fortunately for me it lived up to my expectations.<br /><br />Pandemonium had chapters from different points in time, there were the \\"now\\" chapters, and the \\"then\\" chapters.  Requiem also has alternate chapters, but they are alternate point of views.  As a reader, we not only get Lena's point of view, but we get Hana's point of view as well.  I admit that I when I read Delirium, I wasn't the biggest fan of Hana.  And when I read the novella, \\"Hana\\" I was angered to learn that she was the one who exposed Lena and Alex.<br /><br />In Requiem, Hana has had the procedure for the cure.  She was paired with Fred Hargrove who is soon to be the new Mayor, and they are to be wed in just a few short weeks.  From Hana's first chapter you can just feel her guilt.  In the beginning, I was very happy to see her struggle.  There were times where I found myself saying, \\"Ha!  You got what you deserved.\\"  But as I kept reading, I began to really understand Hana.  I still don't like her, but I did feel for situation.  Hana is definitely your prime example of the popular saying, \\"The grass isn't always greener on the other side.\\"  Lena always saw her as this wealthy, pretty girl who pretty much had it made for her, and that definitely was not the case.<br /><br />It's been amazing to see the growth in Lena in each of these books.  She's definitely a role model to teens.  And in this book you really got to see her emotions.  She definitely has a lot on her plate.  In the previous book she finds out that not only is her mother alive, but she's a top member in the Resistance.  Plus at the end of the last book, she finds out that her first love Alex is also alive.  Just imagine the pain of losing someone, grieving them, and them having them thrust back into your life.  I truly believe that towards the end of Pandemonium, Lena was ready to say goodbye to Alex and be with Julian.  But now she is dealing with having both of them in her life at the same time.  That's definitely a tough situation having to choose between your first love, and your current love.<br /><br />This basis of the story is still the Resistance.  The people who are fighting for love, and those who believe in the cure.  Because the book is from both Hana and Lena's point of view, you get to see both sides.  I absolutely loved that.  And it wasn't confusing at all, and I actually did feel like I was reading the same story just from different points of views.  And while reading, you do wonder if Lena and Hana will cross paths again.<br /><br />Before I read Requiem, I read a few reviews from bloggers who had received ARCs, and a lot of them complained about the ending.  I personally really liked the ending.  I feel that there are just so many things that are in this series, and there is no possible way you can just wrap it up and throw a bow on it in an epilogue.  This is a series about the minority going against the majority.  The characters are fighting for love.  There is no emotion more powerful than love.  Some may argue that hatred is stronger than love, but most hatred stems from love.  These characters aren't going to take this laying down.  I think the series ended with hope, and itsort of gives the reader the option to pick their own ending.<br /><br />Reviewed by Sana @ Step Into Fictionsort of gives the reader the option to pick their own ending.<br /><br />Reviewed by Sana @ Step Into Fiction

B007FDE4Y8|2.0|I didn't have much trouble balancing my cameras on this product. It seems to be a sturdy, well built product, but either my package was missing some parts or the screw that came with it was defective. The screw that connects the camera to the base plate is too long and it does not screw far enough into the screw hole on the bottom of the camera, so it is impossible to tighten it. I used two thick washers to help tighten the screw and it is a bit of an annoyance as I always have to make sure that I catch the washers while removing my camera, so they don't fall off the screw and get lost. I decided to return it.

B000057DON|5.0|Guns N' Roses debut blew up the rock world with it's fierceness and recklessness. Almost every track is a classic excluding, &#34;Think About You&#34; which seems lost on the album. This album has everything you'd want from an 80's rock/metal band, ballz out vocals, blistering solos and dirty hooks. The lyrics on this songs are desperate, insulting and really are an open book. The songs range from sweet and troubled to outright thrash if this was the only G N' R  album to ever come out it would be insane but also in some ways better.<br />Key Tracks: Welcome To The Jungle, Sweet Child O' Mine, Paradise City, My Michelle, Mr. Brownstone, Rocket Queen, Night Train<br />Vinyl Factor: It sounds very good. This album was one of the last analog recordings of the time so it's not crazy digital quality. It doesn't really make a difference but I needed it.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I was late coming into this series. As an almost 50 year old woman, i didn't think I would enjoy the story line.  Boy, was I wrong!  It is a great series and each episode kept me on edge and wanting more.  It's  hard to wait for the next season.<br /><br />Worth watching!  Watch it from Season 1! You won't be disappointed!
B003OJBWGA|5.0|Some of these songs sound like 60's girl group covered by a stark trio of bass, guitar, guitar and a lot of echo. The vocals are clear and the lyrics are clear. The music is a bit sloppy but work really well. For the most part the songs are midtempo but the band makes it work. &#34;When I'm With You&#34; is not on the this record though it should be.<br />Key Tracks: Boyfriend, Crazy For you, Each and Every Day<br />Vinyl Quality: It works here, sounds old anyway.
B0000VAFO0|2.0|The extent of my ignorance of this genre, is illustrated by the fact that it wasn't until I read the Amazon explanation that I knew the film was not about a confusing mix of two kinds of vampire (with human beings playing some unidentified background role). Just how that reviewer gained insight into the murky situation I can't guess, but, not from the movie, I should think.  At any rate, you can see from this fact why my brief comment is directed only at others who do not hold a doctorate in Vampire-Werewolf studies.<br />So what about this battle between werewolves (for some reason the bad guys) and the vampires (for an equally obscure reason, the good guys, with one gal particularly prominent). It is about as interesting as a game of stickball between eight year olds. The Big Scene, at the very beginning, is a battle between two unidentified groups, in which we have no idea for whom to root, until Big Mama comes  along with her sleek ankle length coat and a pistol in each hand (which seems to fire more shots per second much more effectively than the guys could with their bigger weapons). From there it is all downhill,with the denouement being launched by resurrecting to life a dead old leader of the vampires, who is angry at the fact since it is a few days before his scheduled time (or did I misunderstand that?)<br />Well, that is my take on the going-ons, such as they were, but-naturally- I do not expect any  vampirologist to agree nor, yet, any werewolfen. I didn't recognize any of the players but assume they did the best they could with what they were given to work with.
B001GJ30S8|4.0|The infamous Motley Crue's first record is in some ways the best record they did until Dr. Feelgood three albums down the line. They write metal with pop hooks. While some of the record sounds like a young band that hasn't quite learned their instruments other parts are kickass!<br />Key Tracks: Live Wire, Too Fast For Love<br />Vinyl Factor: It's probably better to get this one on CD or just download the songs you like
B007Z9QP3K|5.0|If you are only into feel good movies you will not enjoy this movie. If you thought this was the one with Mathew M.'s dreamy blue eyes staring into the Atlantic, wrong movie, that is U51 you are thinking about. No. This is a movie about war. This is a movie about hell and those who go through it. If booger flinging makes you queasy you will hate a scene. If your sensibilities are offended easily you will not like this movie. Generally, if your mind is closed you will hate this movie. If sailors and there ways shock you, you will hate this movie.<br />If you like incredible acting, incredible historical recreation, and a movie that will give you an idea of what it's like to go insane in an iron coffin, and oh yeah the futility of war in general, there is no equal.

B009AMANH4|4.0|First of all, Daniel Day Lewis's Abraham Lincoln is probably the closest any of us will ever get to seeing the 16th President in the flesh. He is totally believable and his performance is subtle and endearing. When he walks the halls of the White House to leave for Ford's Theater, you truly do not want him to go --so kudos to Daniel Day Lewis and to Mr. Spielberg for providing the &#34;stage&#34; for this performance.<br /><br />Overall, the movie is good, not great. What was missing for me was not so much the context for passage of the 13th Amendment, to the contrary there was almost too much exposition explaining how hard the bill would be to pass and how difficult it would be for the President to move forward with that decision. What is missing is the context for why it was Abraham Lincoln who led this fight, why he was there at that time in history and how he obtained the skills (both personal and political) that helped him lead this fight. We are shown and told repeatedly what a great leader the President is but we are never shown why he is a great leader. His amazing life story, the choices he made, and his evolution from shopkeeper in New Salem to President of the United States all contributed to his leadership during the Civil War.<br /><br />Obviously telling that story would require a larger scope and longer movie (or multiple movies), and I get that the purpose of this movie was to show the passage of the 13th Amendment but the net effect is that, despite the great performance, Steven Spielberg's Lincoln doesn't quite get past the mythological Lincoln of history. He is still a bit of a mystery, and perhaps he should remain a mystery.<br /><br />Unfortunately, there are other actors in this movie that, while good, were ultimately distracting. Tommy Lee Jones, for example, is ALWAYS Tommy Lee Jones. One surprise was James Spader who was nearly unrecognizable. Sally Field also gives a subtle performance as the First Lady (a role that could have been played over-the-top and wasn't) but in the end, she did not blend into her role as well as Daniel Day Lewis did. I wish they would have just cast unknowns for these key parts, but thats a minor quibble. Overall, it's a good movie and definitely worth your time/money to watch but still I can't help but feel Daniel Day Lewis's performance was wasted here.ver-the-top and wasn't) but in the end, she did not blend into her role as well as Daniel Day Lewis did.

B00AFEYUVG|5.0|After hearing a lot about this film, I decided to pick it up on rental. After renting I had to buy it. You can feel the emotions that go through the main character as he goes through his first year in high school. Since the author of the book was directly involved with the film, he was able to make the movie how he wanted, and it turned out great.

B00BCZU8WM|5.0|This album in my opinion pays tribute to some of the greatest artists during my lifetime. I am a huge fan of Purple Rain era Prince and I feel this album is a direct descendant although more modern beats a bump and pop sound this album is more like the telling of a full length movie. Possibly influenced by his success as an actor each song is a scene in that movie and I have 20/20 vision. This is not a RiRi, Chris Brown, or other mainstream artist album it is one for a true listener. The lyrics are some of the best I have heard in awhile and contribute to my firm belief that todays artist arent really artist but puppets singing what the label tells them to and half dont even contribute to 50% of their album songwriting wise. Where as JT is the first name on every track for writing followed by T Mosley (Timberland) and J. Harmon. This album threw me for a loop at first but after 3-4 days of continuous play from my Ipod to my Iphone to the CD in my car it has shown me its depth, story telling and sensual upbeat songs. I suggest this album to everyone I did like FutureSex/LoveSounds but I mostly liked the preludes or interludes on that album more than the actual track. Every track on 20/20 transforms flawlessly sometimes I find myself scrubbing ahead to hear the second part to the song because I love it so much. Id say the filler tracks are Let the Groove Get In, Tunnel Vision, and Blue Ocean Floor although Blue Ocean is starting to warm up I still think the rest are better and I suggest purchasing those to give you a hint of the full album. Its hard for me to put this album into words but its up there with Thriller and Purple Rain 2 of my favorites of all time. Just listen trust me worst comes to worst go to Grooveshark.com and stream it. Hope this helps anyone who is on the fence.

B00C4Q4Q4O|5.0|Vikings is such a great show! I love how the show includes scenes not only of fighting and raiding but also of Viking families, religion, and community life.  I like how the show gives credit to the Vikings for being brave adventurers, expert shipbuilders, and skilled (though fierce) warriors. The cast is perfect, especially with Travis Fimmel playing the lead character Ragnar.  I am so glad that the History Channel is actually finally doing a scripted show! The characters are complex, and the plots are exciting. I look forward to watching the rest of the first season and many more seasons.
B00BGIC2J2|1.0|This film was absolutely a waste of our money. I disliked it for two reasons. First of all, it has no point whatsoever. There was no moral of the story, no climax, no theme, nothing! Second of all, the foul language was absolutely repulsive. Every sentence has a least one curse world - even the children in the movie cursed a lot! This movies was nothing but foul language, sexual content, and a family that fights all the time.

B00992CF6W|5.0|I bought this version for my tablet that has android. My son and I love to. It really is a good version for fans of this game, though it has all the characteristic of the game for PC. We recommend it.
B00AMBH70S|5.0|was looking for this to add to my collection I still have more to collect but it will help me
B00BKTWBMA|2.0|It looks like 'ol slowhand is following McCartney's lead from &#34;Kisses on the bottom&#34;.  Old music for old guys.  A disappointment....but I only paid $3.99, thank goodness.
B005HSL626|5.0|this is awesome!!!!! I love how realistic it is and how you can use a disco blade and stay away from the bombs
B00AHTYI5M|2.0|I did not like all the bad language in this presentation and decided that I did not want my family to be exposed to it.  I saw just a part of it and gave it away to a neiighbor who was a former Marine.
B001BR5NN0|5.0|was looking for this to add to my collection I still have more to collect but it will help me
B00AEK9BKQ|5.0|A great story and well presented by John Hawkes and Helen Hunt.  It arriveed in fine shape, well packaged and on time.  I learned that it was a true story as I learned later and I thought that it really should have been awarded an Oscar for all of the participants.
B000FCK8ZK|3.0|Dexter is my favorite TV show ever!  That's why I got the book.  I didn't finish it.  It's good if you want something a bit lighter than the show.
B00992CF6W|5.0|It's a good game but they need to add a few things enderman,slenderman,Spiderman,batman,diamonds, gold,all stuff needs to be updated but besides that it is awsome game I  love this game though I think this cool this is no scam buy or tournament out on the fun travel around the world
B00BESCUKK|3.0|i am typically a huge fan of Quentin Tarantino, but this was not his absolute best work. i did enjoy the movie, and the price was a good value. i feel happy to have not gone to the theater to watch this. it is great for a rental!
B0065GC0BA|5.0|Innitialy I had no idea what the novel was about and was doubtful that it was one of those \\"just can't put down' type of books. Wow... Was I so so so engaged from start to end. Probably worst decision troughout the journey of reading this novel, was reading it on the aeroplane! Couldn't hold back the tears and felt embarrased when passengers walked by my seat... Oops. Please do read this novel, its beautifully written and really exposes the true love between two people. It explores deecision making and the ability for one to be resilient. Go on, buy it, read it, enjoy it and fall in love with a beautiful novel.
B00BCOGM78|5.0|we were able to see these guys in concert prior to the release of this record. they played a number of new songs off this one, and i must say i was pretty excited about its release 10 days later. i bought it the day it came out, which, for me, means i really, really like something. if you are new to Clutch or a lifelong fan, this is a fantastic purchase. you probably won't feel disappointed.
0393317552|5.0|I really enjoyed reading professor Diamond's views on the way our world has formed with regards to humans and continental differences. Some of his theories might not be mainstream, or even correct, but the effort he puts into research and writing is clearly evident in Guns, Germs and Steel. I found it to be a fascinating read and I believe that if you read this book you will look at our cultural differences in a whole new light.
B0054SMIH6|3.0|This movie was very slow, but the plot was a good one, my husband and I enjoyed it however would probably not watch again.
B000IZ7YK6|5.0|i had to watch this movie for film class and loved every minute of it. Lots of twist and turns that all get solve by the end of the film.I recommend this movie.
B0067R0APK|3.0|With the number of weather apps out there this one is pretty average. Not good/not bad. One of at least three that I check against each other each day.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|I am so addicted! Absolutely love it! It is better than having a pet. The dragons are very well done!
B009JZWO3I|5.0|The end of each episode is such a let down. Can't wait for the next to roll around. Keep up the good writing and production.
B007IQX9ZW|3.0|My girlfriend and I enjoyed it. Took an awkward twist but made sense... Lessons learned and great humor. Would recommend for a nice in house date movie for older couples... In the late twenties
0307454568|3.0|I get the impression that this isn't really a work of fiction at all, but that this is a true story and that the author didn't reveal who it was about.  There are just too many pieces which wouldn't fit if it were just a work of fiction.
B00AZL3PBK|3.0|It started good, however, as I played higher levels, it started to get stuck. It didn't jump the way it should had. I think that there are some glitches on this game; maybe it is my Kindle Fire.  Very frustrating.  I am getting tired of it, so I might disconnect.
B0095P29EG|3.0|wanted to c this movie for a while now am happy it came out so clear and the sound was great i watched it as i cooked and really enjoyed the quality
B00AREIAI8|4.0|I can't believe how much fun this actually is.  Get this game today.  Its more than you think it is.
B009KEN87O|5.0|Awesome game, this game was done perfectly to the galaga concept. There should be more developers that know what they're doing like these guys
B005LAIGQ4|4.0|Better than expected.  Bought it because my grandson is an extra in the film.  Good production values and a good cast.
B0095P33IW|5.0|We love the super hero movies and this one did not disappoint.  Choosing the candidate to be Captain American because he was a good person not just a good soldier helps to reinforce that we all need to be good Americans is fantastic.
B001H4NXCK|5.0|This movie has always been one of my favorites.  Mel Gibson is great in it.  Very funny and very entertaining.
B007REV4T8|5.0|Terrific movie. Best Bond movie since Goldfinger. Has all the Bond elements: great villian, great soundtrack, Bond girl. Craig IS the new James Bond.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|This book is really great. I found no flaws with creativity and historical accuracy. Overall it was an enjoyable book
B002RI9ZRC|5.0|I have really enjoyed reading the book. I am educated as a theoretical physicist and I have done some scientific work in quantum physics. However, after many years that I am not doing science any more, this book brought back happy memories on why I have chosen to study physics in the first place. It is now my favourite book both on the history of discovery of quantum mechanics and on the question of interpretation. The lives nad works of famous scientists are given in vivid detail that greatly helps to understand the scientific developments, and at the same time makes this book a great read!
0307887960|5.0|My son went on this diet and lost a lot of weight.  I am now currently on it with my husband and daughter and hope to also loose a lot of weight.

B008XG1X18|5.0|LOVE, LOVE  IT.  VERY ADDICTIVE.  SO MANY GREAT IDEAS ON ANYTHING AND EVERYTHING.  MAKES ME WANT TO BLOG ABOUT ALL MY ENDEAVORS.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|OMG this was a VERY good book. Its one of those books you need a few days off to read, because once you get started its hard to even go to bed. You just wanna finish it as fast as possible because the suspense kills you. I loved this book now I have to wait til mid May to watch the movie, but cant wait I wanna compare the movie facts with the book facts. Now I need to find another good book Nicholas Sparks wrote. Any suggestions?
B0084U0IEG|3.0|The story was decent but the real treat was the possible reading list created by following what the characters of the book were reading.  Some of it is real and some of it was made of up stories written by the main characters within the novel.  It felt like a gift of stories to this novel's dedicated reader.  I enjoyed that aspect immensely even if the main story itself was not that ambitious.
0446572985|2.0|This is the first Baldacci book I've read and I had to force myself to finish it.  The story seemed to drag on and there wasn't that much action or suspense.  Cool pairing of a contract killer with a 14 year old kid, but the plot just didn't intrigue me. I didn't think there was enough substance for that many pages. I was amazed the author used the word \\"hubby\\" in dialogue, not only by the female FBI agent, but also Wil Robie.  Would either an FBI agent or a contract killer use that word?The word \\"hubby\\" is also used in narration. So I felt the author didn't pay careful attention to staying true to the characters and this jolted me out of the story.  Obviously this author is a national bestseller, but I'm not inclined to pick up another book by him.
B004I4M0A2|3.0|I downloaded this app last year and was disappointed like everyone to find it was not fully functioning,all I can say to all disappointed IT WORKING !!!
0061122416|5.0|I really enjoyed this book more than I thought I would. It is simple but full of spiritual truths. Every time I read this book it offers me something new to ponder and to discover about myself and what my purpose is, and what I believe in. I would highly recommend it!
B001FB4W0W|1.0|First I got my wife these books to read b/c she like storys about vampires. Well last week her friend let her see the first season of True Blood and let me tell you that the acting sucks. I mean the writeing for this  T.V. Show is really bad, its like the people who made this show just graduated High School. The show dose not follow the books at all, they have taken a little here and a little there. For the price that HBO has on this show is crazy. I would not buy this show for anybody at all. If you want to buy a good show from HBO I would say take your money and buy a great show..mmm..lets see Oh how about The Game Of Thrones.
B00BSBT8M6|5.0|Should of won best picture !! (oscar) Great family movie !! Good life lesson movie. Five stars did not let me regret i rented !!
B007IXWL2C|5.0|You will like the ending to this trilogy. It is much more than the kinky book that has been all the controversy. Read for yourself to see how great Grey can be. Last parts of the book made me cry. Hope E L James writes more of Ana and Christian.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is so cool and so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so addicting :D
0920236251|5.0|Very cute story of a princess who loses everything. She puts on a paper bag since she has no clothes. She goes to find the prince she was to marry, but he doesn't like her anymore.  Great lesson on standing up for whomyou are & not worrying about superficial things.
B001NEK2GE|5.0|Me gusto bastante, totalmente programable y fácil.<br /><br />Lo utilizo bastante para jugar WOW, y me ha parecido increible . .
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Finally I can balance my check book easily. It shows me what my previous numbers were, so I can check right then to see if I put the right numbers in.  I almost always have, because the numbers are very big and so easy to touch.
030758836X|5.0|This book was the most original story I've read in a long time! It kept me guessing right down to the last twist!
0385504225|3.0|Book was okay. Kinda had some water stain or somthing making the pages of the book a bit puffy. Took forever to ship to me also
B00BQBNK04|3.0|Again, as with the Highlights, the songs are cut back, not as long as they were in the film. The orchestrations are wonderful but, as many have noted, the voices are not as strong as in the 10th Anniversary or Complete Symphonic recordings. But if you think that they are walking and acting and singing live, you can forgive them their trespasses.  Just can't forgive the producers who cut the music short on the recordings.
B008LG6SXS|5.0|Nice app. I have just booked a hotel with no problems. All you have to do is create an account and that's it
B004QZ9PLU|5.0|Nicholas Sparks is a great romantic writer and the story line of this book is riveting and has a great finish
B007J4T2G8|5.0|What a great companion for a lonely housewife! I felt myself wanting to know more about Christian, but I am sure that will come soon enough in book two......
B001ANSSDC|5.0|The author had a very good sense of how the mentally ill think and react in their daily lives, also the heartbreak the rest of the family goes through.
0756407125|5.0|Oh my goodness what a marvelous book to own! Very cheap and in newly bought bookstore type quality as well!
0385349947|3.0|As a women in Christian Leadership (in the pentecostal/evangelical space), I pastor a church and hold a Doctorate of Ministry in female leadership. National  seminaries like Fuller and Gordon-Conwell have been offering doctorates for years in female leadership. It's good to see that MBA's are following that lead.<br /><br />I am also glad to see that the business community is now acknowledging that women can be in executive roles. As I wish there were more in churches.  As a lead pastor I oversee budgets, lead people, counsel lives and engage in weekly thought leadership from my pulpit. I would LOVE to have more female MBA's on my board. Let's not be surprised if this book makes into a sermon or two. Thank You Sheryl.
0756405890|5.0|Marvelous. This was a steal at a low price, and it was good quality. Truly, an excellent book. Thank you.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I don't know what I was expecting when I read thus book, but it is in my top ten favorites now.  The love story, the twists and turns, and the emotional rollercoaster I experienced while reading this book made me love this book.  It was well-written, and I look forward ti reading more by Colleen Hoover.
B0027MJU00|5.0|Dark but thrilling...hard to put this one down, especially as the plot thickens and details emerge. Unlikable characters turn into the underdogs everyone is rooting for.
B003O86FMW|4.0|Thought the Hunger games was better however enjoyed Catching Fire, looking forward to the next in the series that I have just started.
B00BGIBVP8|1.0|This movie dragged onnnnn and onnnn forever with very little redeeming qualities.  It seemed like a vanity project with too many inside jokes.  I want my 4 bucks back, please.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I especially like the quickness of playing the cards.  Also the different types you can play. Its a boon for sleepless nights.
B00AYDC5HY|5.0|Loved this movie.  The animation was very cool and unique.  Definitely got what I expected from a Tim Burton film.
B008IJTFYW|5.0|This app is great in designing a place to sleep. I love being able to choose what I hear to create an image. One night I'll be sleeping with the cats I miss greatly, the next with Bilbo and the Dwarves on an Adventure in the forest, and then a nice relaxing night at 221b Baker Street.<br />I love how imaginative I can be with this. :)
B00AREIAI8|2.0|This game has fantastic potential however its glitchy and there are popular adds literally every 30 seconds. Very frustrating grrr booo.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I have enjoyed all of the Sparks' books that I have read.  This one involves not only romance, but mystery as well.  It was a great book.  I hope to see the movie one of these days.
B009VMN3RA|4.0|This was a very insightful and interesting read.  It is a wonder that this child has any relationship with her mother.
B00BWI3NIU|5.0|Dido is back better then ever. I just love love this CD. I have not listened to Dido since her CD No Angel which was another great accomplishment. I also purchased Life for Rent which has some good songs but on Girl Who Got Away every song is awesome. Looking forward to her next album.
B009GQ57ES|5.0|Great songs all around if you like thrift shop pick this up a lot of the songs have great meanings behind them listen to wings and see if you can understand the meaning behind it
B007VUA7VO|5.0|Absolutely perfect as im terrible when controlling my battery this really helps i find the display and colours very nice and gives it a good view. I cannot fault it.
B005BRS8Z6|4.0|Very uplifting book. I purchased for my Kindle and sent a hard copy to my mom. We both really enjoyed reading. This is a small sized book. I felt inspired after reading.
B00AYXNKIC|4.0|This game is the best dirtbike game out there yet!!! Especially with multiplayer to test your skills with other people.
B00AB0Z88S|4.0|The only thing I would say is that at times the directing took precedence over the story and detracted from the story.  I also think that it could have been shorter.  I still enjoyed it very much.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is soooo addictive and fun. You really need to download this. Really great game to kill some time.
B00BWJARHO|3.0|Disappointing as it wasnt like the book AT ALL.<br />Somewhat boring in the beginning...<br />I wouldnt rent it agsin not would I want to add it to my collection of LOTR.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Temple run 2 is waaaaaay better than the first. No freezing issues, or crashing issues for me at all. Love the graphics, cool fun game to pass the time by when your on the train, a passenger in traffic, waiting at the docs office, lunch break, etc. Love, love, love it! Plus no ads for me at all. Kindle Fire HD. LOVE IT AMAZON!

B0095VPAVE|4.0|this is a great budget chip and it has very good performance,particularly if teamed with a decent video card for gaming purposes.<br /><br />the onboard video does a great job but a little weak at 1920 by 1080 resolution,on the other hand it is really decent at 1280 by 1024 on a smaller monitor like a 17\\" job.<br /><br />the stock Cooler however is a complete joke as i have set the temperature warning at 70 degrees Celsius and under a full load it trips the alarm quite frequently,i highly suggest a good aftermarket cooler,especially if you plan to overclock.<br /><br />my review is based on stock speeds and the cooler is not even good for that with a Max Turbo at 3.9 Ghz.<br /><br />it really shines on Windows Xp 32 bit and Windows 7 64 bit and i dual boot these two operating systems.<br /><br />i have this in a Thermaltake A30 case,G skill 4 GB Ripjaws Memory @ 1600 speed and a Gigabyte GA-F2A75M-D3H,presently a Evga Geforce 560 Ti 448 core Classified i had laying around but i plan to use a Geforce Ti 660 in the future.<br /><br />with a tight build with great memory and a decent motherboard it is a very good chip but not perfect and the on board graphics blows away a Intel I3 which is what this is designed to compete with. AMD has always been about Bang for the Buck!<br /><br />Update 4-9-13:i swapped the Power supply out in the rig this is in and it now seems to run cooler than it did not tripping the 70 degrees Celsius alarm like it was but i still strongly suggest getting a better cooler than this.<br /><br />i think the improved cooling was because of better cable management as this is in a Micro Atx case and the power supply is a Modular one unlike the one it replaced.<br /><br />get a good cooler and a decent motherboard with good quality memory and it is a nice snappy little chip,it holds up well compared to a older Intel Q9400 on a Asus Striker 2 motherboard in certain applications and in others it blows it out of the water if there is AES instructions inthe program being ran.<br /><br />it does well,even if the Q9400 is overclocked to 3.3 Ghz but keep in mind that this Chip here still has weaknesses in single thread apps.<br /><br />if running Windows 7 i strongly recommend getting the 2 Bulldozer patches as it does help quite a bit.<br /><br />if on a Gigabyte Motherboard you can enable One Compute Unit in the Bios and it shows up as a dual core then in Task Manager inside windows,it helps with the weak single thread performance.<br /><br />this has the Piledriver cores which is a improved version of the Bulldozer and is what the Bulldozer should had been in the first place.
B0041SGYVQ|3.0|I wanted to like this, was jazzed to have another Emma to view, and also enjoyed the reviews of obviously sincere and discerning folks who liked it so much.  Unfortunately, there was a lot I personally found distracting.  Spoilers follow.  As other critics pointed out, Emma's facial expressions read so modern, and so smack of spoiled teen drama queen, that I found it off-putting.  I noticed she often has her mouth hanging open, which struck me as something someone of that era, at least a cultured young woman, would not likely evince.  She reminded me of a rebellious teen in the style of a young Hayley Mills- all that was missing was a wad of bubble gum.  Also, in a couple of scenes her hair was teased and tousled looking, not in keeping with the period.<br /><br />The flouncing around on furniture that other critics mentioned didn't bother me that much, though.  And I must say I admired much of the direction, the enlarged view of the grounds, the surroundings, the rooms, very well done and provided a sense of being there, a vivid sense of time and place.  Great locale shots of people walking, riding horses, etc.  I also liked the script's and Gambon's characterization of Mr. Woodhouse, probably the best I've seen, he's more complex and sympathetic, less of a caricature than in other versions.  Ditto with Miss Bates.  Similarly, I liked the script's opening focus on young Jane and Frank being taken from their homes, while little Emma stayed with her father.<br /><br />I also liked Miss Smith.  But the other characters, not so much.  I felt most of them were lacking, pale, insipid in comparison to other characterizations.  Jane Fairfax a great beauty and talent?  Hardly.  Mr. Churchill a charismatic hunk?  NOT.  The governess, far too young.  Mr. Weston wimpy, for some reason.  And Jonny Lee Miller, interesting, engaging, yes, commanding, no, not dashing leading man material, not here, not for me, anyway.  I've liked all of these actors elsewhere, I'm not sure why they suffered here, likely a combination of the script and the direction.  For example, I thought the \\"Badly done!\\" scene was decidedly ho-hum.  But I liked the picnic scene before it, thought it well-done, dramatic.  And Romola Garai was certainly charismatic, able to cultivate viewers' interest and sympathy- just so out of keeping with JA most of the time I had trouble getting past it.  In some scenes she is truer to JA, for example, in the carriage scene in which she rebuffs Mr. Elton, her demeanor more befitted a young woman of her station.<br /><br />Anyway, I give this three stars because I thought, as a standalone film, not compared to the book and other films, it was entertaining and engaging, due to JA's plot and its accessibility, allowing viewers to immerse themselves in the time and place.  Also, Garai is charismatic, commands the screen.  And even though I think the production suffers in comparison to others, I think it's definitely worth seeing, to round out one's Emma experience.<br /><br />Though I think the Paltrow/Northam version is light years better, for my money the Beckinsale/Strong production is the quintessential Emma, by far the best version yet made, both in terms of being true to the book and in being the most romantic, dramatic, with the best-drawn characterizations  (in that version, for example, Frank really IS an impudent dog and Jane is competition indeed for jealous Emma.  And Samantha Morton is great, as always).  If you haven't seen it, do.<br /><br />And BTW, if you haven't seen the 2004 BBC production of North and South, I thought it FANTASTIC, so poignant, romantic, both heroine and hero WONDERFUL and complex (I just saw it, watched it for free on Prime and immediately ordered the DVD).  It's not frothy, no comedy of manners, it's a drama, slower-moving but portent with meaning, existential, life or death issues, the tension between values in southern and northern England, and those of the moneyed vs the working class.  Also aboutthe love within families, between friends, within our human family, just wonderful.  I loved it SO much I downloaded the kindle version of the book (published 1854) by Elizabeth Gaskell, which I also adored.  Sort of like Jane Austen (less scathing wit, more vision and heart) plus the Industrial Revolution and a social consciousness.  And SO romantic- \\"every age is the same, it's only love that makes ANY of them bearable...\\" (to borrow a line from Malcolm McDowell in Time After Time).

B00B0VI1XQ|5.0|This past year has been a series of let-downs as artists I previously liked and was very excited to hear new music from disappointed by shunning the qualities that made them successful in the first place. Fear not - Bonobo delivers, big time. This is an artist who is able to shift and expand his sound from album to album without losing his best qualities. In a way, Bonobo has gone back to his roots in The North Borders, almost completely eliminating the jazz-influenced sounds of Days To Come (which, admittedly, I will miss) while reintroducing many of the quirky instruments from his first two albums (xylophones for instance) combined with the synth and club beats he introduced in Black Sands. The result is by far his most textured and layered album to date, with so many sounds and instruments and clips in the background it almost sounds like IDM music, only far more sweeping with a much richer sound.<br /><br />There are a few downsides. The album is bracketed by the two worst tracks on it (the first and the last). Do not let these songs dictate the sound of the album, as is immediately obvious with the second track, Emkay, one of the album's best. Other stand-outs are Cirrus (though the radio edit is the better version), Know You, and especially Ten Tigers and Transits, the best two tracks by far. Ten Tigers starts like a night at the club and morphs seamlessly into one of the most beautiful tracks Bonobo has ever crafted. Transits is what I'd call the best \\"single\\" from the album featuring gorgeous vocals to a moody effervescent flow. Overall, this album is on par with Black Sands and nearly on par with my favorite, Days To Come, which is to say it's a masterful album that demonstrates how well Bonobo can adapt and expand his sounds without losing anything in the process. I have full confidence in Bonobo now and eagerly await anything he will come out with in the future.<br /><br />Fans of this album might also like: Emancipator (Safe In The Steep Cliffs), Berry Weight (Music For Imaginary Movies), Trebles and Blues (Self-titled), Michita (One)

B000063TS9|5.0|After suitable hemming and hawing, and appropriate hand-wringing, my vote would go to Dmitri Shostakovich 1906-1975). I would have to concede that he was an isolated musical conservative, a late Romanticist whose use of atonalilty and chromaticism was purely decorative, whose work had little influence on younger composers outside Russia. I would need to acknowledge Shostakovich's own deference to Stravinsky. But then I'd turn my ears to his fifteen symphonies and six concerti, and especially to his fifteen string quartets, a vast body of work of both intellectual and emotional power unmatched by any of his contemporaries. Then there are his works for piano, and his two finished operas, one of which, Lady Macbeth of the Mtsensk District, resulted in his \\"denunciation\\" in 1936, at the onslaught of the Stalinist Terror.<br /><br />The two \\"Jazz Suites\\" and the ballet The Bolt are not compositions of finest inspiration. They're caustically schmaltzy vaudeville/BigTop music, intended to amuse and excite an unsophisticated audience and to pass therefore as \\"music of the Soviet People\\" rather than elitist/ bourgeoise formalism. That was the standard charge brought against any composer whose music didn't delight Comrade Stalin, and Shostakovich's career was a roller-coaster of denunciations and appreciations from the Man of Steel. There's no reason to suppose that Shostakovich was naive about Stalin or the Soviet bureaucracy. He was humiliated, harassed, and sidetracked time and again. It's worth noting, however, that none of the despicable treatment Shostakovich suffered in Russia was a whit more disgraceful than the unjust harassment of the scientist Robert Oppenheimer by J. Edgar Hoover, Harry Truman, Lewis Strauss, Joseph McCarthy, the HUAC and the FBI. Their stories are remarkably parallel, except that Shostakovich survived with his music intact while Oppenheimer was destroyed. If you doubt my judgment, read: [[ASIN:0375726268 American Prometheus: The Triumph and Tragedy of J. Robert Oppenheimer]]<br /><br />Shostakovich stayed the course as an idealistic communist and a Russian. Following Stalin's death, his stature was somewhat vindicated. He joined the Communist Party in 1960, though some biographers suggest that he was bullied to do so. And he composed brilliantly \\"on demand\\" for patriotic and communistic occasions. Was his musical communism sincere? That doesn't matter so much now, does it? Shostakovich also composed film scores and \\"propagandistic\\" ballets that were seemingly relished by his audiences, works like those on this CD. My guess is that an American audience would \\"hear\\" these works as brashly, blatantly modernist ... shocking perhaps ... and exactly what they were not meant to be. There's nothing of \\"jazz\\" in the Jazz Suites except some racy tempi and razzmatazz orchestrations. In fact, the \\"Jazz Suite No. 2\\" has been misidentified; it was titled originally \\"Suite for Variety Stage Orchestra\\" an that's precisely what it sounds like. What other composer, after Beethoven, has ever brought the same musical genius to bear on the sublimity of string quartets and the bumptiousness of \\"Tahiti Trot\\"?<br /><br />Let's take a little risk here and imagine a time a few hundred years in the future, when the calamities of Climate Change and the inexorable turmoil of religious warfare have thinned out \\"our\\" preconceptions of the oddly-named Cold War era. Music has survived, as it damned well better! And thus we have the few iconic composers of the USSR and the USA: Shostakovich and Prokofiev for the former, George Gershwin and Elliot Carter for the latter. Is my point already obvious? Which side, the Communists or the Capitalists, came closest to an integrated, popularly appreciated musical culture?dy of J.

B00753MBHA|5.0|Who would of thought that two of the better Metal/Rock albums of the last 15 years would come from Accept. Metallica, Megadeth, Anthrax where are you ? This is great music, unpretentious, driving ,quality and recorded really well. \\"nuff said\\".
B0025UHKNS|5.0|Had older model, love the changes.  The download is simple, charging device is more effective, rotating screens are great, heart rate band picks up heart beat immediately...lightweight, fairly easy to familiarize yourself with...have to say I do love it.
B003SWNRU2|5.0|How many 80s bands are still making music? How many are any good ? This came out of no where. Along with the new Van Halen, GnR, and four of the last Iron Maidens this and the follow up are all you'll need for quality Metal. I got tired or reading all the five star reviews on Amazon and bought this and I'm glad I did.
B00AESN8XY|5.0|It may be off putting to some but i find this game to be engaging and enjoyable. Bought it on sunday and have played it a dozen times already. Bio engineer a plague to wipe out humanity by using genes and dna points to effect transmission, lethality, drug resistance and more while trying to stay ahead of attempts to find a cure and destroy your very own global pandemic. What's not to love?

B002GHHHPQ|5.0|An excellent true story of A B-17 bomber crew soon to complete their required 25 missions.It shows what they went threw on their last day and how scared they were.
B0076DCT2G|5.0|Nelson DeMille is, in my opinion, one of the best writers out there - and almost as good as John LeCarre. But he has produced a talent that is unusual and that is the ability to write in the first person that is rare. John Corey - and the wit he puts on the character is at times really funny and it adds to a serious plot as well. Nelson is a rare author and this book is up to his normal high standard. My only complaint is that he needs to write and produce more of his super books. Why? Because I have read them all and want more!!!
B008IYSMLY|3.0|This season sucks. The bad guys are some doomsday religious weirdos, the killings are pretty weak and lame, and the overall quality thus far (9 episodes in) is poor and just outright disappointing...
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Can't wait for the next book to come out. If you like Fifty SHades you will love this one I promise!
B005D643PO|5.0|Dexter grew a lot this season and Harry's impact on his life is more prevalent. I am impressed with the acting and very content with the results.
B000FBFN1U|5.0|I can't put this book down.  It's a way better read than the first two.  I don't have HBO but I can't wait to finish this bood and look forward to purchasing the third season when it comes out.

B005LAIHZY|5.0|I really enjoyed this dvd, especially in Blu-Ray editdion.  The story is well done, color is excellent and I'm going to have a tough time hanging on to my copy because many grandchildren and great-grandchildren are  going to want it!  DF
B0064MPXFA|5.0|I love this show. Quality network television is hard to come by these days. Great writing, characters and story lines.
B0064X7FVE|4.0|Great app with a lot of information, but not quite a flashy or appealing as the app for the ipad.
B00957T6X6|5.0|Amazing. Can't wait for winds of winter! George rr Martin is a genius. A series that everyone must read. The North remembers!!!!!
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This book hit me in all the areas where a good book should. I've laughed, yelled, cheered, wept and grieved as I got lost in the pages of this book. This is seriously a must read!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|im really glad i have this game because it inspired me to keep it instead of delete it because of its fun updates
B000QCS8TW|4.0|This series is great and I recommend everyone to read it... well not everyone.... but people who like fantasies and medieval stuff.
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|Great graphics and puzzles can be quite hard, good hints and interesting storyline really enjoyed it and will be buying more.
B000FC1HBY|4.0|I like fantasy and series' .... so naturally I started this series and it really is great. I enjoy it very much and having it on my kindle is really convenient.
B001W2I9Y4|5.0|This album is awesome I heard the czar on this album and had to buy it the rest of the album is just as good.
B00ABXA1HI|4.0|These developers put a lot of effort into making their product high quality. I'm pleased with most of the features.
B0091REZMW|4.0|Fun fun game. Great way to pass time when you are bored. Also addictive. Love that it's free!!!! Great way to pass time
B007N5YIUS|5.0|grandkids really enjoy playing with the game.  They are having a lot of fun with the game every time over
B008K6HN8I|5.0|What can I say? Without this app, you cannot fully utilize your Kindle. Too many things are difficult to find and impossible to manage without this slick, little file manager. Just use care; it does give you a lot of control which makes it easier to mess stuff up as well as to make it better.
B006LSZECO|2.0|Read this book for my book club and was thrilled when I finished it!  A sad commentary on some marriages.
B00AFYZDL2|5.0|They started in 1979, 34 years later, \\"Sacrifice\\" is released and still delivers great riffs, power and metal. We must take advantage of the fact that great Rock bands like Saxon are still on and creating music, and buy the album that is so valuable. As an extra we have some re-recording of Saxon classic that is also interesting to explore. Keep on, because SAXON KNOWS HOW TO ROCK!!!
B001DTPZNY|5.0|Got this for my husband to complete his set! Even if you don't really care for this one, it's nice to have to make the set complete!
B00A0MJ9ZA|2.0|the only thing is that the bluray box was broken on the inside, and it does not hold the discs properly.
0393061310|4.0|The novel itself was pretty interesting despite some of my peers viewing it as boring, but the novel was filled with detailed facts while constantly including new, exciting facts so as not to appear droll. The sheer amount of factual information in the novel is astounding, but the novel itself is a pretty easy read and shouldn't inflict too much pain upon the brain.
B00499K9E0|5.0|Really, British TV is so much better than American. This show is just the best! I just wish there were more episodes per season. Can't wait for Season 3!!
B00BP3DPJY|4.0|Great Album and a very good price. Love the music and I like to download stuff as well. Have a nice day.
B00008BLB8|4.0|GRAND FUNK-CAUGHT IN THE ACT: The mid seventies was prime time for overblown double live albums, providing breakthroughs for acts like KISS and PETER FRAMPTON and encapsulating careers for others. Detroit groove-masters GRAND FUNK are in fine form here, appropriately kicking things off with FOOT STOMPIN' MUSIC and ROCK & ROLL SOUL, which pretty much sums up their \\"boogie till it hurts\\" credo. Obligatory drum solos and audience-baiting call and response sections, classic earmarks of every concert stage back then, propell MARK, DON & MEL (and keyboardist CRAIG FROST) through funky fan faves T.N.U.C., BLACK LICORICE and celebratory jam band covers of ERIC BURDON's INSIDE LOOKING OUT and THE STONES' GIMME SHELTER. Axe ace FARNER and gritty timekeeper BREWER keep a tight rein on things, their blue eyed soul vocals ably abetted by the female \\"FUNKETTES\\", who lend a gospel air to \\"party down\\" anthem WE'RE AN AMERICAN BAND, imaginative BRILL BUILDING regurgitation THE LOCO-MOTION and pumped up singalong SOME KIND OF WONDERFUL. Some fans took a bit longer than others to get hip to GRAND FUNK, but CAUGHT IN THE ACT is an ultimately satisfying coda for their long, explosive career.<br /><br />RATING: FOUR FUNKS
B0060MYM7O|5.0|This one of my favorite shows on television. There are so many interesting characters and story lines going on in each episode. I could easily go back and watch it again.
B00AW28HF6|4.0|This is one of those books that introduces someone to a writer who is probably going to go far in his career (as a writer). The story was solid, the characters believable, and the locations well done. It felt a lot like an earlier James Bond story, if the hero was female, Israeli and had actual feelings.<br /><br />The only thing that held me back during the reading was the dialogue. Mostly, it was done well, but there were times where I found myself wondering if people would actually speak that way. The trick to dialogue is to write as people talk, not just to get the grammar and English right. There were a few times where the back and forth of the dialogue caused me to stop and think, would people in this relationship actually talk like this on a constant basis, and there were a couple of times where I had to say no. If this was fixed, there's no reason in the world I wouldn't give this book 5 stars.<br /><br />But I don't want to detract from the story itself, which I found to be well worth reading. There are a lot of books that get released these days that just go through the motions, and this one definitely didn't do that.<br /><br />I highly recommend it.
B00992CF6W|4.0|I wish it was more like the computer version so it would be a whole lot more fun.... otherwise 5 star
B000XWJQF0|4.0|My son loves the new TMNT cartoon on NICK and remember watching this years ago so I decided to download it to keep us occupied for a few hours.  He and I enjoyed it very much.  Great Pick!
B00B22IJXK|5.0|This is a good app to have if you like trying new thing like me if you like drawing you will love it .
B00ABMZRVO|4.0|Great story about real life and subtle hints about enabling the addictions and how hard it is to distance yourself from someone you love when you know that may be the only solution.
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|I always wanted to play this game because I see my older sister playing and I think it was a fun game to have I love drawing any one can play this game .
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|I was recommended to this book by a friend and had put it off. I started reading it last night and am so glad I finished it the day the sequel came out! It is hard not to fall in love with the characters, especially Travis. It is filled with lots of ups and downs, and definitely pulls at your heart strings. It's definitely worth the read and I am anxious to read walking disaster!
1567184855|1.0|I was excited about reading the book, because it had alot of good reviews. But after about the fourth chapter, it starting sounding to much like going back to school. Then he said somthing about the soul sitting with another soul and eating lunch or somthing to that effect. If you are a soul why do you need to eat? And one of the spirit guides put on a scary mask, cmon this is to far out there for me. I believe in reincarnation, there are some other good books out there, this writer just wants to put money in his pocket.
B005J3IEZQ|5.0|As an IT professional I'd read lots of articles on Steve Jobs to the point where I thought a book about his life would be a waste of time. However I was pleasantly surprised to read this account as it helped me realize the true extent of his genius and the fuller extent of his flaws.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|I liked following the characters from the first book.  The historical events were more disturbing since I lived during that time period, unlike the period of the first book.
B00BP4Z8XY|4.0|A lot of films today are same old story line, but this was a fun and inventive movie.  My 5 son found it hilarious.  I'm glad I rented it.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Just make sure you have everything you need, because once you start watching you won't be able to stop watching
B00C1BU7V8|5.0|I am not an american citizen, but have always been fond of american history.  This movie was most captivating from start to finish.  I would watch it a dozen times again!!!
B00BHHIWQO|2.0|I love the game but it keeps freezing, and often.  I had to connect to fb just to keep my standings.  then I have to uninstall and then download again.  obviously there is something that has me hooked but it sure is an annoyance!
B00428LIXO|5.0|totally cute, and helps my grandson with his hand-eye coordination. This toy is gentle, yet adorable, fun for the little ones. Even older siblings get a charge out of this toy.
B005GFPZYK|3.0|I am at 70% of this book and I am still having a hard time with the author grasp on the misery of war?
B002OSY2T6|5.0|This toy is adorable, and my grandson got quite a big kick out of it. A nice feature is that it has a mirror, so when he is a little less mobile he is still entertained by his reflection. Clever idea
B0095ZQ36G|5.0|I went into the book with a bit a prejudgement like the author , but came out with a brand new view of the events of thart era.
B001AQR3JY|5.0|How can any person not rate this move anything but wonderful. Disney cartoons really put the magic into the children's eyes!
B008MG1E4A|5.0|I saw the movie and decided to read the book, I was doing it backward but it was worth it.
B00A9T1HUO|5.0|I have all of his music.  His voice is amazing.  I love all of it from classical to jazz to modern.
B00BWGISB4|5.0|I have followed the New kids on the block from day one, I love every song that I have heard on this album 10. My favorite is the remix and back to life, they have really grown up and have got better with age and the years. I watched them this morning on the view. I recommend this if you are a new kids fan!
0470474874|5.0|This is for someone that needs to learn Excel, but is unable to attend or afford the cost of attending an educational class.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|this app is very fun but whenever you play in wifi tons of stupid adds pop up and mess up the game
B008XG1X18|5.0|This is the perfect app to save all the wonderful recipes and decorating ideas I find on the Internet! My favorite!
B00BP4Z8XY|4.0|The main message of this movie is that we all have value, regardless of how others may devalue us. The move contains a good amount of retro humor for parents as well.
B002K0WBXW|5.0|Funny, good story line, and Sandra Bullock is always terrific. He makes a great foil. Scenery is delightful, even if not filmed in Alaska.
B0071XO8RA|4.0|A fun read with lots of drama and a good story that will continue. I crosses age lines so many in the family can enjoy it.
B00AF6B22E|5.0|Great Movie! Denzel really out did himself on this one!!!! After seeing this movie makes me not want to fly anymore lol!!!!!!!!!!!
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|I have this on my kindle fire & my phone. Its alot of fun makes time from boring to challenging!  So get it!
0061992860|5.0|Lest you should ever get your ass kicked by a girl (Mother Nature); go ahead and toss one of these in your trunk, bug-out bag, backseat of your truck, or keep it in your back pocket for all I care...It isn't the best read for going to sleep at night, but I'll tell you this with utmost certainty:<br /><br />The day you NEED it, you are going to be awefully darn happy you have it with you...
B0027MJU00|4.0|Wow!!  Flynn always leaves me surprised and stripped of the feelings that I started the novel with.  Hopelessness and sadness reverberate throughout this novel, but like a train wreck you just can't turn away.
B007SGLZP8|3.0|Maybe I am just getting burned out on murder mysteries but this book was just a typical who done it. It is an easy read, a simple beach book, ie simple to read while hanging out on the beach
B0064X7FVE|4.0|Like all Kindle Apps, it works great as long as you have wi-fi.  Again, this app is a known quantity.  You know what to expect, and it delivers it.
B009FZFONO|5.0|Again the show is FANTASTIC but the Amazon VOD service is still not very good.  I bought the HD but it is no better than SD streaming so as a service to all VOD customers Amazon should just say everything is HD and leave it at that.  Charging more for HD is, IMHO fraudulent.  Also the VOD service itself is very spotty. There were a few times when my Walking Dead episode would not play, the longest I have had to wait was a couple of days to finally view the episode.<br /><br />WALKING DEAD SEASON 3 FIVE STARS<br /><br />AMAZON VOD SERVICE 1 STARS
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Pretty  fun, I love horses and this game is pretty realistic I must say. You get to feed them and bath them and compete.
B00AN0KBJC|5.0|One of the best television series ever. It would be nearly impossible to portray everything in the books in the series, but the directors have done an excellent job of capturing the essence of George R. R. Martin`s work.
B008V59AFW|5.0|NOT ONLY BY THE CASE AND PRESENTATION. BUT NOT FOR A VERY HIGH PRICE. TENES solo album THE BEST OF PETER GABRIEL POP remastered in digipack with outstanding sound, BUT A FULL CONCERT TOUR THAT WAS ONE OF THE MOST SUCCESSFUL OF THE PLAYING THIS CD Conciones CLASSIC AND PREVIOUS highly recommended for a person who liked PETER GABRIEL CDs of the 80 -
B00A9T1HUO|3.0|I am a Josh Groban fan and no matter what he sings, he sings well.  However, I was not turned on by his choice of songs on this particular CD.
0316069434|4.0|Good gripping book. Very much like any other Harry Bosch novel. Kept the reader wondering as to the actual motive.
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|This game is loads more fun than jewel quest, the action is faster the rewards are better. It's just all in all a way better game. Loads of levels . No bugs that I could find. Runs really smooth
B004SIIBGU|5.0|Love this app I can check prices and follow my bids anywhere even at work when im not supposed to
0316069884|4.0|I had a difficult time reading this book for a multitude of reasons. First, I thought JSF was a bit too negative toward the humane farms who helped out in the process of writing this book. Second, JSF is preachy as hell. However, it's been about a year since I read this book and I have completely changed my diet. I can no longer look at the meat at restaurants in the same light and quite honestly, food has become a little less exciting. I didn't become a full fledged vegetarian like JSF wanted (that argument was a little weak), but I always critically review every farm that I eat meat from. At the end of the day, I still think about the humanity behind what I am eating so I guess this book did what it set out to do. Don't get me wrong, I love Pollan, but he didn't convince me to change my diet.
B007Y56JDQ|3.0|But... I ordered this cd and didn't have time to listen to it for several weeks.  When I did, I discovered the 2nd cd had a problem...  I did not report it because it had been so long since I purchased it, I felt like no one would believe I had taken so long to listen to it.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Beware! This understated and utterly proper British drama series will become an addiction before you know it. I did not know I would like it so much.  Most likely I will buy season four as well.
B004FRX0MY|4.0|For now all I can say that it works.  I got it installed and tried it out once, but haven't had a chance to play with it any further.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Some are easy. Some are hard but not impossible. Keep trying. You'll get it. Sometimes you have to think outside the box because the answer is not obvious. Can't stop playing it!
B00A2LFXVI|5.0|To see his work come to life in these cartoons.  This story is more action packed then all of the older batman cartoons combined.  Fantastic.
B008N9AASC|5.0|Wonderful movie, we watched it several times and always see new things to talk about.  i've given it as a gift to my family.
B0093ICOJ0|5.0|Loved the books, heard this was on par w/ them.  Scooped it up immediately and was not let down.  It was like watching the comics come to life.  Amazing
B00BSBT8M6|5.0|This movie is simply amazing. Beautiful, touching, engrossing... and with a wonderful twist at the end that makes you want to watch it all over again!  Not to be missed!
B00785P2QC|3.0|As with all games from this developer it is great quality and does not pressure you to spend money as badly as some other well known brands.<br /><br />I would love to simply purchase the game to play how I choose instead of posting to Facebook for credit.<br /><br />All in all a good game if you have time on your hands.
B000FCKGPC|4.0|Another great volume in the Game of Thrones Series.  Really enjoyed this one.  I'm looking forward to reading Book 5.
B0044C3RB4|5.0|One of the few shows that doesn't fall into the multiple season grind or get formulaic. Will Peter stay in this world or the other one? How will Faux-Olivia handle the pregnancy? Can't wait to find out.
B00BWJ7LYG|2.0|I have been a huge fan of these books for a very long time.  Tolkien took classic northern myth and fairy tails and re-spun them into a literary fantasy masterpiece.  Unfortunately many years after they were written a man named Peter Jackson came along and decided that the source material was not good enough and that he could somehow change it all for the better.  There are a few qualities about this film I liked such as the actors who portray Thorin, Gandalf and Bilbo.  I also enjoyed the oh so important songs actually portrayed in the film.  These things however are not enough to save this franchise in my eyes however.  The orcs are magically able to fight in open daylight in several scenes (this would completely negate the need for Uruk-hai in the later stories if this were true).  Bilbo tackles a full grown orc off his feet and gains the upper ground in a wrestling match before stabbing him to death.  These small details I can ignore but the blatant use of cartoon physics (domino trees as one example), silly cartoon voices (the trolls for one) and terrible dialogue (&#34;that'll about do it&#34; as the goblin king dies) make the whole movie feel like a Saturday morning cartoon.  I realize that The Hobbit is a slightly more childish and light hearted tale than the rest of the ring saga but it was never downright ridiculous.  And while I am talking about silly, what is up with the strange dwarven hairstyles.  They look more like something out of a Disney cartoon than a Tolkien movie.  And who decided that dwarves are Scottish?  It would also be nice to hear the worgs and eagles speak as they did in the book.  Taking council with the king of eagles would have been a really beautiful thing to see brought to life.  Lastly Radaghast the brown (don't know if I spelled that right) was one living Disney/wb cartoon all rolled into one.  And why bird crap on his head?<br /><br />Beyond all that the movie is fairly polished other than a bit overuse of CG.  Many breathtaking scenes as we have come to expect from Peter.  There is a great deal of powerful acting but some of the best scenes are marred with silly visuals.  Soundtrack is fantastic and I was pleasantly surprised to find that they did not just recycle the previous music for this film.  There is a lot to be praised but at the end of the day I would rather have a well written story as close to the source material as possible than a beautiful film hollow and empty of the magic the books captured.scenes as we have come to expect from Peter.

B004YAS9N2|5.0|Very relaxing, excellent composer! I first heard of this cd from the British film, &#34;This is England&#34;. Purchased it for the one track, but it is a great cd in its entirety!
B00B2064IY|5.0|I am an huge Jimi fan and have all of his albums but this one may take the cake. It has some amazing instrumental tracks and some tracks redone in studio (you can tell) that are even better. Highly recommended!
B009CWWFD2|4.0|I sensed a bit of Cain and Able in this book, but, as always I liked it very much. Great character development again, although a bit lengthy in places. i would recommend this story to all of Archers readers as well as to those not yet acquainted with his writings. i have always believed that Jeffery Archer is indeed the best story teller around, and this book confirms my impression yet again.
B00881VLCE|1.0|I was a huge fan of this game, addicted really, but since the last update I can only work one puzzle before I have to uninstall then reinstall the app only to be able to work one puzzle again.  Terribly disappointed because it was the best puzzle app out there.
B003O86FMW|4.0|That was a great book. It further develops the storyline and characters with in all of the district's. It brings you into their life and their daily struggles.
6301792734|5.0|The most epic movie(s) ever made. I do not regret buying these tapes, especially since they cost much less than the BlueRay package
0385341008|5.0|I love this book. Although a fictional tale, it gives a true picture of the occupation of the Channel Islands by the Germans during WWII. By telling the tale through letters, the writer invites the reader to embrace (or dislike) each character in the book, and certainly makes one care about the outcome! I actually researched information on the Isle of Guernsey after reading it - and found that much of the &#34;local color&#34; was, indeed, based on truth.  Read this!
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|When I first purchased this book last week, I read it in less than 24 hrs...I loved it so much I quickly pre-ordered the second book Walking Disaster and in the meantime read Beautiful disaster for a second time!
B005K17RU0|4.0|Very complete and easy to navigate. Will be a great help as I travel to other locations during coming months.
B002BU0DPE|5.0|pros: the sound is dynamic and the is good not too cheap not expensive just right  cons: long ass wire and it hurts your ears after a couple of hours
B009FZHYKU|5.0|It's so much more than a show about zombies. Walking Dead asks the difficult &#34;what if&#34; questions that force us to see who we are as flawed, struggling beings.
B00992CF6W|1.0|there isnt enough gold and i hate the new update where sand and gravel collapses<br />other than that it is ok
1426308469|4.0|My son loved this book! The pictures were great and the information was ideal. I would definitely recommend it for any child.
B004GUSG4M|5.0|I love happening upon a book that was not recommended to me. This book was such a thrill to read. It kept me reading through the night and on into the next day. This was page turning suspense at its best!
B0095P33IW|5.0|This movie is part of the Avenger series of stories. I love that the writers are tying all the Marvel characters together in multiple films. If you enjoyed the Ironman movies, you should enjoy this somewhat of a prequel of the Avengers.
B005PK1G76|5.0|We use this on our Bumbleride jogging stroller and we love it! It is secure and holds two bottles of water (even the large refillable containers), two iPhones and even my large wallet. There is a small zippered section that one can put their keys (or something small) in, but we don't use it as our stroller has a great clip for keys.
B007N31YFW|5.0|If you are a drummer/percussionist, you will likely really enjoy this movie. I am, and it is great fun to watch. Excellent comedic moments and a wonderfully woven tale. I believe all drummers sense the rhythmic pulses both in man-made constructs and in nature. This film is a tribute to the driving beat within us all.
B006WZLCZ4|5.0|Hape is a brand we trust and this set does not disappoint.<br /><br />Some sets are too large, made of metal, or the paint comes off onto a wooden kitchen you spend hundreds on (the Melissa and Doug set). We've had experience with quite a few and this one is perfect for our 15 month old, even though she has played with it since she was 12 months.<br /><br />Our daughter can put veggies, fruits, small dolls, whatever - into the pots and \\"stir\\" them around. They fit on the burners an are small enough for small hands.<br /><br />If your kiddo is older, these might be too small, but ours just love them.<br /><br />Oh and because your kid, like ours, might use the knives as nun chucks, you might plan on putting them up for a little while. :)
B008LSVLZG|5.0|Steven Wilson (founder of Porcupine Tree) is a wonder, and perhaps the most gifted progressive rock composer of this era. He surrounds himself with superb musicians, as he always does, on his projects. The integration of great musicians to construct, interpret and unfold his musical vision is part of his creative genius. Steven Wilson always finds a way to clearly express what is on his mind and in his heart. This 2012 live concert from Mexico City is outstanding. For Porcupine Tree fans, you will notice &#34;new&#34; players, but you will quickly embrace their talent. If you are a Steven Wilson fan, this a MUST own!
B007SGLZP8|4.0|It was a good book but not really his best one.  Sometimes it was confusing but it still held  your interest and kept you reading.
B00BEJ5O6Q|5.0|I sent this to my girlfriend, and she absolutely loves this album very, very much. Thank you very much for doing such quality work...
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|The Downton Abbey series is fabulous.  The costumes and acting are 5 star.  The computer program, flashplayer, used to watch on my computer is horrible though.  Downton Abbey is worth the complete reboot after each episode required to reset flashplayer to watch the next episode.  I highly recommend getting involved with this series but would recommend watching off a cd rather than a computer.
B00B3HJMLM|5.0|I gave it as a gift to my girlfriend, and she really loves this album very, very much. Thank you...
B007GCY8FS|3.0|At this point in the Reacher timeline, his stories have mostly eschewed large surprises. Every novel is minorly surprising in its own way, but also reassuringly predictable. Readers follow Reacher for clever action, smart dialogue, sparse prose, and an archetypical, though immensely likable, protagonist. The latest novel naturally meets the requisites, but some plot twists end in disappointingly predictable or simplified ways. Child does offer a slight departure that is novel, but leads to a slow midsection that cramps the pacing. A Wanted Man also showcases more wit than usual, which is a welcome addition. The story follows the Reacher formula faithfully enough to mostly satiate any Reacher-itches, but fans of the series are more than ready for him to get to Virginia. An larger plotline encompassing reoccurring characters and multiple novels would be welcome too.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I really like this game. A lot like temple run but with it's own quirks. Much easier for children to play. Our family is addicted to this game!
B00AMBH70S|5.0|I was worried that this one would not be as good, without Matt Damon, but it was fantastic!  Maybe even better than the others.
B007Q0OUNA|5.0|I ordered this for my 8 year old grandson for Christmas.  He loves anything Lego, and the fact that it was Lord of the Rings made it super special.  The smile on his face and the hug that I got when he opened it said it all!!!
B00BGIC2J2|1.0|Didn't notice that this movie was not rated or I would not have rented it.  Language and vulgarity abounded.  Never again.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I absolutely loved this book! It was a great read from beginning to end. It was like just when you thought you knew how it was going to end something new happens then you realize you won't know until you're done.
B008Y73940|4.0|Very enjoyable with lots of twists & turns to keep you interested. Acting is very good too! I highly recommend it for all you mystery buffs.
0385349947|4.0|This was a very well written and thought out book.  I also thought the length of the book was appropriate.  My favorite part of the book was that she told personal anecdotes to 1. support her perspective; and 2. for the reader to better understand the context.<br /><br />I think every woman should read this book.  A man will also benefit from it so good luck trying to get your male friends to read.  But all in all, highly recommend this book.
B009H7SCMA|5.0|Alan Hardy's bawdy take on the upper class versus the working class is gloriously, unashamedly and rudely exposed or in this case overexposed. The story is centred around a cricket match for boys and one girl. The focus of attention is Gabriella a real ball-breaker and every boy's wet dream as she creates havoc on and off the pitch. She is an ice-cold blond and proud of it, using her beauty like a sword to slice boys' hearts in two. But then she meets Jim, a lowly working class good-for-nothing bowler. We get to meet Gabriella's parents as they lay waste to the lower classes, Jim's mindless parents as they waste their lives away on nothing and Chivers a real treat as the chauffeur come all-rounder who dispenses all that is needed to keep Gabriella looking her best. But it's the clever use of cricket which sets this great book above its rivals. And as the match progresses so lowly trollops are defrocked, gardeners drained, balls beaten senseless, rude awakenings exposed, in fact everything that life has to offer is wickedly lampooned. But most of all it's a poor boy meets rich girl and let the battle of the sexes commence. 5* entertainment in one match. How's that!
B004EPZ08O|4.0|Well I was really looking forward to seeing what I thought was the final &#34;Final Destination.&#34;  I was somewhat disappointed seeing that it was  similar to the first, except that it was more bloody and in your face. I had hoped it would somehow explain the movie more and possibly beat the odds in the end. Glad I got it now my set is complete, but I wish it had more action and less blood.
1400069807|5.0|If food has salt, sugar, and fat - I have pretty much loved it at one point or another. I have battled my food addictions for about 20 years now. Lost most of those battles.<br /><br />Reading this book has made me feel like my food struggles were completely understandable. Bliss points? Food designed to taste perfect without being too satisfying? Companies determined to increase their &#34;stomach share&#34;? Tobacco companies owning food companies and sharing their research about making addictive products? No wonder I struggle.<br /><br />Lately, I have been trying to eat healthy, and in many ways I have switched my meals over to healthy eating with lots of fruits and veggies and little a meat and dairy. However, my snacks have still been a processed food free-for-all. I just couldn't give up my snacks. I wish I could say that I have given up processed food completely and am no longer interested in my favorite snacks (chips and dip or Oreos and milk). I can say that they have so much less allure to me now than they used to. I still indulge from time to time, but nothing like I used to. This book really has changed how I see them. They don't have the same &#34;comfort food appeal&#34; that they used to have.<br /><br />Learning about Lunchables and Coke and Cheetos from Michael Moss helped me to see these foods as simply products pushed and marketed at any cost by people desperate to win every edge over any competitor that they can get and to see us as simply walking mouths with wallets.<br /><br />It sounds like a dry, boring book and a strange conspiracy theory topic. It wasn't. It was one of the most interesting books I have read so far this year, and it really has changed how I look at processed food now.
0790729369|5.0|I bought this copy the first time and it never played well, being that it was used previously. I did love the movie so much though that I bought it again only it was a new copy. So now I'm happy.
B002RSDW80|5.0|OK, straight up, the movie isn't perfect. Especially if you know anything of the real person behind it, well, its not entirely convincing (for a movie based on real people.)<br /><br />That said, it has a delightful and always beautiful Amy Adams, and impeccable Stanley Tucci at his finest, and ...<br /><br />Meryl Streep.<br /><br />She is more than a scene stealer, she steals the whole movie. Her Julia Child is fantastic, utterly believable, full of emotion and vitality (and a touch of pathos.) If you love superb acting and Meryl Streep (the two go together hand in hand) you will not be disappointed.
B009FZFONO|5.0|The season finale did not disappoint! Great episode! Also, the quality of the picture was very good. Would definitely recommend.
B0087EACJK|4.0|Pretty cool game. It's an original concept. Well executed. I looked at all the game photos and was pleasantly surprised that I the actual b game looked much better.
B0099G3I96|4.0|I don't listen to radio so I'm not sure if this album got any airplay or how sales did but it is a solid No Doubt album.  It definitely has the No Doubt sound with something extra added.  There are at least 4 very strong tracks on the album and the rest really fit in and support the overall effort.  I subscribe to a streaming service so don't buy as many albums as I used to BUT I DID buy this album.  Worth It.
B004SCN2F6|5.0|I don't usually buy apps, but after playing the free version, it seemed cool enough. As an child, I grew up playing retro video games. This game combines a turned based  game with spaceships! LOL, I'm going to go play it. Cool game.
B007QNRMUU|5.0|This is the new sensitive long-hair artistic side of Jason Mraz but the song writing is great and the songs are emotional and very good.  As with all albums, there are tracks that stand above the rest but overall it is a strong release.<br /><br />You should check out his appearance on Daryl Hall's web show (now on Palladia) Live from Daryl's House.
B004HWYTP4|4.0|funny movie. Good amount of action. Acting was Great!! All Star cast! Good Story. Cannot wait till the sequel comes out this summer.
B00BETX5PS|2.0|No Bond girl, No cars accept an antique bond car, No bond gadgets, No villain taking over the world, Only some disgruntled X-agent out for revenge  A poor excuse for a bond movie.
B00571F26Y|5.0|After reading this book and understanding what wheat does to my body, I am in the process of illuminating wheat completely from my food consumption. In a short period of time (2-3 days), I've  notice that my joints do not hurt, I am not craving something to eat all the time, I sleep better, I do not have the morning sinus drainage, etc.  Thank you Dr. Davis for writing this book to make us aware of the issues our bodies have with wheat and how we can improve our lives by taking it out of our diets. I think everyone should read Wheat Belly by William Davis, MD.
B0090CVJZ4|5.0|Im very happy with these banana plugs, they look to be well made and were a great value. These Banana plugs make for a cleaner, easier and better quality installation of speakers. I couldn't be happier with my choice and would highly reccomend these to anyone looking for quality and value all wrapped up in one!
B00846REIS|5.0|Another page turner! I can't not wait for the next book! The passion and tension between Gideon & Eva is simply addictive!
B002361MLA|1.0|started the few first pages and realized it is not my thing.. you need to be into that spiritual mindset to enjoy it.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|I love this book! It is the first one in the series and sucks you in on the 1st page! I could not put it down! I love the characters Gideon & Eva! The fact they are both &#34;messed&#34; up is very appealing!
1400067820|5.0|His authentic thinking is a joy, sometimes really lol. (Wishing someone his personal doctor!) His terminology; skin in the game, via negative, non-linear convex, the green lumber fallacy, the Lindy effect and many others are suddenly recognizable in the world around me. I'm reading it for the third time because it is so much fun and because every time it is more informative and useful. I wished I could have read it 35 years ago. Never has a book been so exhilarating, confirming in its devastating clearness.
B0095ZQ36G|5.0|I bought this book after reading newspaper article about the passing of the English soilder Charlie. It mentioned his story and the book that was written about what happen between him and the German soider Franz. As a huge WWII buff it caught my attention and I immeaditly went to my kindle and down loaded the book. I am very happy to say it was worth it. The story of these two men, how the survived a war on opposite sides and then found each other years later is truelly amazing. If you want a good read I suggest this book weither a history buff or not you will enjoy it!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|101 in 1 games is fun. I like how you have a variety of a lot of mini games.some are ferry easy but you also have the ones that are harder to do and sometimes hard to pass the game.
B0096DZKZC|3.0|The game is pretty much okay. The graphic are pretty nice and it can get entertaining. But it takes up so much space on my Kindle fire that I couldn't install other games. Only buy it if you have a 16 GB device or more.
B00AKEMHCA|5.0|You guys shude get this game it has beast NEW characters and way better maps.This game has no crashes.So piece guys I'm out.
B00AW0KHMY|5.0|The romance, dedicated loyalty Bella has for her daughter, husband, in-laws and the wolf pack. The incredible twist at the end, that could of been disastrous was extraordinary. ( the greatest trilogy ever )
B002ZM74Y6|2.0|Left 2/3 way through before the melodrama got heavier.<br />Trivial subject and story, stock characters, well-enough executed for that. .
B0041KVW2K|5.0|Even after reading all the harsh reviews i still bought it because i love the beatles. Arrived sooner than expected and it is worth every single penny. The box set came in perfect shape, no tears and the records themselves are in perfect shape with no warping or cracking what so ever. Played every single record that you get and all of them played flawlessly and of course they sound very beautiful. The booklet that comes with it was perfect and it gives great insight of the albums and it includes beautiful pictures of the band themselves. So yes, buy this box set and you will not regret it, worth every single penny!
B002KEZ96Y|5.0|Unique and special commentary on us as a country and our values.  Lots to think about afterwards.  What is life all about?
B0067Q04AM|5.0|Black Radio<br />Robert Glasper Experiment<br /> Great CD for those who appreciate great lyrics.  Great collaborations with other artist, including Erykah Badu.
B00985E3UG|5.0|We all really need to know the information that Michael Moss presents in this very thorough expose.  As all the lifestyle medicine physicians are telling us about the U.S. obesity epidemic and its tragic associated health problems, &#34;It's the food!&#34;.
B00BJ9VBLI|4.0|It's fun, but I have other games that catch my attention better. My 8 year old  and my 43 year old hubby both play it. This makes me feel that the game is fun for kids of all ages.
B00A9X9TIW|3.0|Wow, what a weird rollercoaster ride this movie is. I almost gave up on it after 30 minutes I grew so bored. The start is not good given it starts off with the whole voiceover narration explaining what a \\"looper\\" is. That's usually the kiss of death when you have to explain the premise of the movie before it even really gets started but once Bruce Willis shows up the story does take off. Sadly, it's only in quite spectacular spurts.<br /><br />There are some huge flaws with this like why in this badass future are the guns so 18th century-like? They even call them blunderbusses. Is this some inside joke because I did not get that at all? Then we get the whole odd makeup they put J. Gordon Levitt in to make him look like a younger version of Willis. Sorry, but it did not work at all. I just found it a total distraction especially wondering if those Noel Gallagher Oasis eyebrows were going to lift off and make a movie of their own in many scenes.<br /><br />Throw in an excellent Emily Blunt (oddly playing a Kansas farm girl because apparently in the entire acting community in the U.S. there is not a single American actress who could have possibly played this Midwestern role) with the scariest kid since Damien in The Omen and this movie does have some get up and go. Where it went and ends up is pure sci-fi mumbo jumbo at times. Basically, cut through all the nonsense and it's Terminator--guy goes back in time to kill off the kid before he can become the powerful evil guy in the future.<br /><br />The extras help explain the connection Levitt has with the writer-director of this so now I understand why friends should not let friends act in their movies. Levitt's a very good actor, but his attempt to be a younger Willis just did not fly for me at all.
B0091REZMW|4.0|I have played this for months through Facebook and was happy to see a kindle version, it's very similar. I haven't figured out the friend thing yet, but I think  it will be even better!  I never have paid for playing.  Just wait and energy is restored.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I actually ended up listening to all of the books from Overdrive.  I found the story very entertaining, with lots of intrigue.  A very enjoyable listen!
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|My grandkids and myself love playing this on my kindle! We try to beat each others scores. They always win though!
B00B2V66VS|2.0|Not what I was expecting.  Game to complicated to play and not fun.  Rather play angry birds.  Oh well, better luck next time.
B007MC8YLQ|5.0|This seems a little more dificult than the computer version.  However, it's justas addictive and takes up way too much of my time.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|My son loves this crazy game, as do I.  It kept him busy on a three hour air plane ride.
B001O37WTY|4.0|The movie is just way too interesting to pass up. There are so many cringe-worthy moments infused in the humor and oddity of the film. After finishing the movie, it was on repeat so I started watching scenes from the beginning again and everything just ties in so perfectly! Definitely worth watching at least once! And I recommend watching it twice.
B007IK44CK|4.0|The movie was action packed. The high up shots took my breath away. But all in all a good movie.
B00BWGISB4|5.0|my first ever NKOTB album and I Love it! the vocals are great and each song has amazing production quality.
B00APJLFEG|5.0|this movie was totally adorable and youll love it forever and eternity... well maybe until the sun comes up. ok
B005LAIHZY|4.0|Well written story with good characters.  I rank this one pretty highly in Disney's catalog, but not as highly in the Pixar specific catalog.
B000LB7G00|5.0|Wish these spacenavigators had a little more grip on the bottom.  They tend to slide around the desk top rather easily.
B0042FZOFU|5.0|Still the best Pixar Disney's to date, probably best Disney to date.  All three movies in Blu-Ray, in a box set.  Not much more to be said.
B00BEZTMFY|5.0|Really enjoyed the Hobbit.  It has pretty much stayed with the book.  My only regret is that I have to wait to see the two other parts.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I love this app. It is great I read it daily when I can. I use this app in church instead of my paper Bible.
B0060MYM3S|5.0|I have really enjoyed both the first and second season.  So far the series has stayed on track with the books  Acting and locations have been excellent.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Was so excited to read #2.....Now on to book #3.....Just love reading on my Kindle Fire and am looking FWD to the next movie....Thank you Ms Collins
B009JZWO3I|5.0|This show has a good balance of drama and humor, and I have been a fan from the first.  I am very glad of the option to view via amazon when I was unable to see the regular-time airing of an episode.  I hope it lasts for years.
B00019074O|5.0|This film epitomizes what true fun is!  It is a great time. This film does what a film should:  you should escape into the world played in front of you.  You shouldn't even be aware of you environment. This film is funny,  should I say F U N N Y!

B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game it now my new addition. Try it I'm sure you'll find it to as fun as I have.
B00BHHIWQO|1.0|I initially liked the game, but what I did not like was the need to purchase more lives(hearts) to play.  In addition, I was not really clear on what I was actually buying.  For instance, if for $1.99, I receive seven bars of gold, I am expecting to have 35 lives (hearts).  However, that was not the case.  It seemed to me, that I only received 5 hearts and that was a big draw back for me, because I like to know what I am paying for and I could not get an answer from Amazon customer service.I feel, that even if a game is free, additional purchases for that game should be clear.  No gimmicks!
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Just simply loved it always had me guessing what was next for Christian and Anna. Can't wait for more of what Christian thought.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Ok, ok, ok.....if you have never seen this show before it is not all about killing zombies. This is not a horror show. It is about the survival of this group of people in a world consumed with zombies. They are not trying to find a cure or figure out the source of the zombie infection, they are just trying to survive. They deal with multitudes of problems including ethical decisions and personal choices. Season 3 ending was not what any fan of the series expected and were severely disappointed with, but it leads them to a pseudo-plotline for Season 4.
B005L38QK2|5.0|Very easy to use the mouse，Respiration lamp is very beautiful，Size is also suitable for hand。But the function keys on the right is not too good

B005K17RU0|5.0|A clean, efficient interface reduces clicks in favor of swipes.  Easily and quickly view weather for multiple cities.  Loads fast, and hasn't crashed after dozens of uses.
B000FA675C|5.0|Good book. Great read . Can not wait for my son to read it . He will like it too.
B001HNE3NO|2.0|Fascinating events, certainly nothing I knew of from the U.S., and to the extent we can learn of them, through this book or other means, then great.  But, as a book, the writing is weak, predictable, and not particularly satisfying.  Perhaps the translation is the problem, but I doubt it.

B000IZA9PI|2.0|Because vampires, apparently. I just wasn't buying what was being sold. New enemies, old enemies too easily defeated. Lacked strength.
B001GCUER0|5.0|one of my favorite new shows! i wish i had AMC so i could watch the new seasons as they air, but SO GLAD i have the option to order them from amazon for a descent price! worth it!!!!
B001LOPYHI|4.0|CLassic sci fi. I'm sure some of the effects were very difficult to do back in the day. Don't expect too much though, can be Plant of the Apes-ish at times
0783225482|5.0|i havent watched it since i received it. dont know if it is scratched yet but the packaging looked great. ive seen the film before, excellant movie. will have to write a new review once i know what condition the disc is in.
B007SYWFRM|4.0|After the update recently with the addition of the underground dino world, there are some bugs/glitches where the loss of animals/dinosaurs occurred where they were irretrievable and now need to be repurchased. Money has been spent and repurchasing animals is wrong. I fired off an email to see about retrieving the lost animals and have heard nothing. It's been weeks since that email.<br /><br />Overall, the game has been entertaining.
B000YABIQ6|5.0|one of my favorite new shows! i wish i had AMC so i could watch the new seasons as they air, but SO GLAD i have the option to order them from amazon for a descent price! worth it!!!!
B004SBULWE|5.0|This is a really recommended product. Really great for making sure that you don't leave apps open and use data.
B004ODLUF8|5.0|This is one of the best movies! I originally saw it in an IMAX dome theater, and was left in complete awe! The dvd came in perfect condition, and if you have blue ray, this is definitely one i would recommend for a high quality player! Also very educational for children!
B004SD5GZ4|5.0|I use PDF files for work, so I tend to use them at home as well. This lets me use those files on my Kindle as well.  Now if i could only fget their Flash Player to install.
B007BVOEPI|5.0|I was skeptical that any show with this much hype could be worth watching.  I was quickly drawn in, though.  I rarely watch anything twice and I've watched the entire first season 3x already.
B005HSL626|5.0|Another in the long list of time killing apps I have for waiting.  This is a fun game that I can use and quit with no worry about my long term score.  Just a fun time killer.
0812984412|2.0|I did not like this book at all, I was confused at ever twist and turn and the book was total nonsense.
B003YL4LYI|5.0|I have been too busy reading these fantastic tales and now looking for more.  Can not get enough of his writing.  I think his next book is Winds of Winter and should be out soon.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|The game is great, so many levels and continuous fun. Four days and still continuously playing it. I would suggest it to everyone
1608871452|5.0|I love it. It's a giant book with EVERYTHING I'd ever want to know, full of GORGEOUS pictures and posters and stickers and-- god, it's perfect. I love it.
B0030ZOYHC|3.0|Its a great movie. The problem is when you check the back of the package you notice you are suppose to get a 20-page guidebook. Well.. you don't get it. The problem doesn't end there. The package overall looks cheap. As for the artwork on it. It looks like a bootleg to be completely honest. It suppose to be glossy and reflective. It like a foil card would be best way to describe it. The one that you actually get looks like someone put the actual item's cover on copy machine and glued it on the one you received. So bottom line you get the movie you want which is great but the package is...bad and misleading.
B00633W614|5.0|The 2 Clifton books are both outstanding.  Wonderful characters and great story.  Really looking forward to the 3rd one later in the month.
B00AIUUXHC|4.0|I love to win. This game is challenging and I love getting to new levels. Just wish there were more jewels available.
B00AFCEIB0|4.0|I just like Google as my main search engine.  This app makes it easy to get to Google on the internet.
B00008BXJG|5.0|It had been many years since I had this on vinyl & having bought it again recently has reminded what a great album this is even today. I have to say the Bon Scott era was definitely far superior.
B0055SWM08|4.0|Still learning the ropes, but this app is pretty entertaining.  Affordable and worth a try if you enjoy logic problems.
B00BBQXQFI|5.0|It works, what more could I ask for. It works, what more could I ask for. It works, what more could I ask for.
B00571F26Y|4.0|Interesting book and giving it a Go was feeling very down and suffering from all the symptoms of wheat belly. Going to try it for 2 months and see if it makes a difference with how I feel.<br />Never heard of 7 whole grains a day but 5_7 serves of vegetables a day.<br />Vegetables are in as are nuts raw nuts which is no problem to get where I am now
B00BM1AJIO|5.0|Best game I have played in a while.  I play lots of games like this one ans this is by far the best.  It's not a short game like some of them.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|It helps in math and other school work I am so excited about it and other school work I am so happy
B007MC8YLQ|5.0|I play this to get my brain going in the morning. It is a good logical exercise and requires that you plan ahead to solve the puzzle.
B00BEZTMQ8|4.0|The picture quality is very good. Only the sound mix is sub-optimal in my opinion. The music and sound effects are very loud and the dialog too soft.
B006LSZECO|4.0|Now that's just crazy talk! Great book.  Really keeps you guessing and surprised. Looking forward to digging into sharp objects next.
B0060QM09M|5.0|Read these first as a child and it had an impression on me, reading it again 35 years later still loved it.
B00AEFY6ZQ|4.0|I love this movie but there was at least a half hour cut out that was in the original and the VHS version.  Took a lot away from the enjoyment.  If one had never seen this movie you wouldn't miss the parts cut out but for those of us who have seen it before it is disappointing.
1878424319|4.0|I love:<br />- The easy-to-digest language.<br />- The simple clarity of the four agreements.<br />- The concept that most people are asleep/dreaming.<br />- The idea that a dreaming parent benevolently passes this trait on to his/her children.<br />- The explanation of an irrational world and path for easier living for readers who are already awake.<br /><br />However, I am sad that this book, like most books really, is unlikely to wake the sleepers/dreamers up. What an amazing world we would have if it did.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Really look forward to watching the next episodes.  Wish I had more time to watch shows.  I can't wait to see what happens next.  I love Mr. Bates.
B004R13U6Y|3.0|I am still trying to figure out how to get to the home page of the book I downloaded on here. I can't find the instructions for this PDF reader. I have managed to read the book but I can't figure out the extra features. It's pretty good but confusing.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Thank you so much for having this Bible free to download. I take my kindle everywhere and this is perfect.
B004XQYBA2|5.0|I am pretty new to Sudoku.  I decided to try it out using this new app.  I love it.  Easy to use.  No issues at all.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|It's a lot of fun and I look forward to purchasing other varieties of this game and many other games.
8866130931|5.0|I love this planner - for me, it has plenty of space, and that's saying a lot since my handwriting is on the larger size.  I can see how people feel that the paper is a little thin, but I this is the first Moleskine product I've ever had so I have nothing to compare it to.  I've had issues with pages tearing out of different planners I've owned, but I definitely think the quality of this planner will keep up with me for the rest of the year!
B000OT8GCQ|5.0|Another Nicholas Sparks great book! Couldn't put it down and now on to more of his to read!!! Must buy
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|I have always liked this games. This one is a little different then I am use to. Once i figured it out I love this one too.
B0050IY61G|5.0|This book is exactly what it says it is, a complete guide to Asperger's Syndrome.  Whether you are recently diagnosed yourself, have a child or family member who is, or you just want to learn more about AS, this is a must-read book.  Tony Attwood does an excellent job of explaining things in a very easy to understand manner which emphasizes hope and acceptance.  I have read many books on this subject, and I consider this to be the definitive resource, the most helpful piece of literature I have found thus far.
B0095ZQ36G|5.0|This was an amazing story and one of the best WWII books I've read! It was neat how it was told from two different perspectives, one being the American bomber pilot and the other the German fighter pilot.
B0091REZMW|3.0|i really like the game but i cannot stand games that make you require energy. I would play it so much more if i didnt have to wait a few hours for my energy to load
0843178442|5.0|Such a fun book to use your best snobby impersonation! READ TO EVERY CHILD THAT CROSSES YOUR PATH. Enjoy it.
B004LROUNG|4.0|Great insight into the world of class action lawsuits, the cascading greed of our legal system, how our government benefits from this greed, and the need for tort reform.
B006LSZECO|3.0|I did not like the ending. It was as if the writer just didn't know what else to do.  The other explanation might be that she is planning to continue in a second book.  I have read Gillian Flynn's other mysteries and found this to be the weakest in regard to plot.
B000JIJPZY|5.0|I have a son who is now 4 months old who absolutely loves this toy, even my two year old daughter tries to steal it from him when ever possible.  What I love is that it doesn't annoy me when they play with it, so I don't feel like I have to hide or get rid of it to save my sanity.  Plus I love playing with them in it!
B00AE2J5HI|5.0|This was one of the BEST movies I have seen in a long time. My husband and I really enjoyed this! We reccomend it to anyone who wants to see a good movie! :)
1933865474|5.0|i love the way bruce draw,and paint .all of his character feel real but they cartoons.he should print the superheros one.
B007BVOEPI|5.0|I love this series. I cannot get enough! I got my husband to watch it with me and we are both enjoying it!
B003ODIZL6|4.0|It helps my daughter a lot when she does not know a word and I make her look it up in a dictionary.
B00BSBT8M6|5.0|Epic, timeless, life-inspiring, spiritual, dazzling visual effects, beautiful music, heart-touching protagonist, deserving of its many awards, truly one of the best movies of the past year
1558908455|1.0|This movie was very inappropriate and I would not reccomend it at all.  Save your money and spend it else where.
B00B1ME3DQ|5.0|I haven't been this pumped on a Clutch album since they released Robot Hive/Exodus! This is certainly the most straight forward rock album they've put out since Blast Tyrant, and if you like that album you're going to love this one. From start to finish it just slays everything in it's path! It's not too long and it certainly leaves you wanting more.<br /><br />The best part? If you're a new Clutch fan this might actually be the best spot to start! It's not their absolute best album (but it's certainly in my Top 3), so you'll still be totally pumped when you go further back in their catalog.<br /><br />Bottom line: If you like hard, full bore, guitar driven rock 'n roll you're going to love this record.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|This is an excellent alarm clock.  I had originally purchased one that was $1.99, but it only worked one day.  This one works each and every day....I actually use it as a back up to my regular alarm clock just in case there is a power loss.  (So much for paid applications when free ones actually do a better job!)<br /><br />No one should be without this app as it even works when the kindle is off.  (You can conserve on the battery at the same time!)<br /><br />Recommend to anyone!
B0036BK6MW|5.0|I haven't received this dvd,Blind Side yet.  I have seen this movie.  I think it's super great! Everyone needs to see this film.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|So long post-it notes....Evernote is here to stay!  This app is absolutely great!  I love the convenience of using this.....I just contacted the developer the other day with a few questions that I had, and they got right back to me....which was super.  I would recommend this app to anyone--whether they are taking notes for a High School or College Class, or they are writing reminder items for themselves, keeping track of contributions, or just recording everyday information.<br /><br />I deleted this program in favor of another note program (which now ceases to exist), but before they packed up, I re-installed Evernote.  This program was used to help me teach, and it is installed on both my computer and on my kindle.  Having looked at each program in the Evernote family, I'm now decided that this is the program that I need to have.  I can't believe how often it gets used, too....<br /><br />This is great!
1250027624|5.0|I am enjohying this book. I like the photographs and details about life at that time. The book is beautifully executed.

B0034DGPEU|4.0|I really enjoyed reading this book - it addressed alot of issues and how they were dealt with in the early 1800s:  mental illness, slavery, treatment of women.  This book was well-written with characters vividly portrayed, it was at times sad and disturbing.
B00000J7JO|5.0|I love this group as well as Nirvana. This album brings back memories because I remember when MTV used to play the video for scar tissue (back when they actually played music). A must have for any RHCP fan.
185984054X|1.0|As an admirer of Christopher Hitchens generally, this is one of the most disappointing of his works. Hitchens clearly has a wonderful way with words, its just a shame he didn't use them for more worthy projects.  He argues that the money received could have built first class hospitals and offered healthcare that we in Western countries take for granted. He any many like him obviously have no appreciation for the breathtaking levels of poverty that the Missionaries of Charity attempt to alleviate (and improve where possible). He's intellectually dishonest in presenting quotes out of context and seems to think that the real crime here is being a Catholic. His well documented anti-religious views have obviously muddied the waters between potential grains of truth and propaganda.
B00BCZU8WM|4.0|JT picked up where he left off 6 years ago with a more mature sound, but never losing touch of the feel good charisma he instilled in his music. If you want the blink and miss it pop music stick to your Beiber and Gaga, Justin's the read deal transcending multiple genres and always remaining relevant when you think he's gone.
B0095P31L6|2.0|The story line and movie overall did not come across as a kid friendly movie.  I would not recommend this movie for girls under 10 years of age.
B00AIUUXHC|2.0|When I first got the app it was great. But then, one day, the app crashed. After that it never saved my progress and each time I play I have to start from the beginning. Which sucks, because I was pretty far into the game.
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|It's a very fun and addicting game. It has okay graphics and is user friendly. Five more words! Got it.
B005IFWXWU|5.0|This is a great album full of tasty songs.  I was a fan of House, and always liked the music at the end of each show.  I thought that Hugh Laurie's taste in music might  mirror mine.  I knew he played piano from the show, but had no idea that he sang.  This is a refreshing collection of bluesy, well-performed songs; It has become one of my most-listened to. Really nice collection from a talented musician ...Who new?
B004FRX0MY|3.0|I didn't like the player. But since my Google Play sync doesn't work, I use this app to download and play the music with Google Play Music.
B0091REZMW|5.0|Easy to use. Nice graphics, and fun. Very pretty and keeps my attention,  which is hard to do...nice going. I would definitely recommend this app if you love hidden object games. Its also free which doesn't hurt. Has achievements and relaxing music...didn't make you want to cry. I'm pleasantly surprised.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|Very fun for a free app. It is kind of like Cityville or Empires and Allies. I like the multiplayer too.
B00AXVIHBU|5.0|I am so hooked on this show.  The third season was the best.  This show caught my emotions like no other story has in a long while.  I feel like I am a member of not only the family but also of the servant staff.  I would highly recommend this series to anyone and can't wait until the new season starts!  A must see!
B00B23O96A|4.0|Clapton's return is an interesting conundrum: gone is the fiery bluesman from the 60's and 70's heading down to the crossroads to confront the ghosts of the blues legends who have preceded him.  Instaed, we get Clapton in a new incarnation--a content, secure, free and musically wandering musician.  On Old Sock Clapton moves from pop to rock to reggae to even some standards.  If \\"Layla\\" is here, she's part of the \\"couple living on the hill\\" contemplating if \\"our love is here to stay.\\" Clapton is exploring music he grew up with as filtered through his days as a rock star.  Even strange bedfellows as \\"Gotta Get Over\\" and \\"Your Only Man\\" belong together, if only because Clapton has put his own spin on them.  Honestly, this isn't my favorite Clapton album (that distinction belongs to Layla and Other Assorted Love Songs), but it's enjoyable.  Clapton can still play.  It's nice to hear him unencumbered from expectation or reputation.  Play on, Eric!
B003TH14H4|5.0|Starrted on Season 1 on the advice of a friend and season 2 was just as good, the more episodes the better. Looking forward to season 3.
B0063M22QO|4.0|I have always wanted to play this game but never had done so until now. I would have given a 5 star rating but since I don't have any experience with which to compare, I think that the 5 star rating should be reserved for actually having the tiles in your hands, and having to physically shuffle and form the towers.<br />Lacking that element, I am very pleased with having the Kindle version and rate it as 4 star. Thanks for making this available to Kindle users!
B0043WDK2G|5.0|Working my way through the seasons and I still love it.  The chemistry between the characters is great and the 3 story arcs all completment each other.
B008JGSM6G|3.0|Maybe it's just me but I don't get the point of this game at all except that it's another way to make money by charging for hints.
B008K6HN8I|4.0|I find myself installing this on all my own android devices - and any systems I support for friends and clients. The network share browsing option is essential to my daily operations - this is just a better file browser
B0063IH60K|5.0|A very good, well laid out electronic version. It's almost like having the actual cards in your hands. Thanks for making it available to Kindle users!
B00B2JSRAS|5.0|All these experiments work! Once I started the book I couldn't put it down. Pam is a great writer and I look forward to reading more of her books
B00BHMETKC|5.0|Even though you know the story, and might have remembered the whole incident and the edginess it brought to the world at the time, still kept you on the edge of your seat! Affleck as a director is superb!
B001ANSSDC|5.0|I think works of fiction grip us best when we are uncomfortable--when we are on the protagonists side and we don't want them to continue what they are doing because they will get hurt and their actions may result in a downward spiral. And this is precisely what Silver Linings Playbook did for me. This novel was excellent!
B003VWU2WA|3.0|I've had my Powermate for years (since they first came out) and I love it. I only use it for volume control, but it's great having this well-made fairly large knob to reach for. However, while I still have it working under Win 7 Pro, I suspect it's days are numbered.<br /><br />Back in the XP days, when you turned the knob a visual indicator would appear so that you saw the current level and could see it changed as you rotated the knob. That visual display disappeared with Vista.<br /><br />Though mine is holding up beautifully, I wonder how much longer it will work, in terms of OS support. I hear that OS X Snow Leopard was the last release it'll work under on the Mac, and who knows when it'll stop in Windows.<br /><br />It's been years since Griffin has touched the drivers, and you have to search to find the product on their website. I've been tempted to buy another one to put aside, but it may never get used given the lack of driver development.
B005HSL626|3.0|Its fun, kids like it but I prefer the xbox kinnect version. _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _
B004SIP9U6|5.0|This movie is very much a classic, timeless piece.  The great writing, excellent photography and actor portrayals are most enjoyable.
B0089LOKHG|4.0|I like this book/series except for the occasional swear words. Being a young adult book, I was hoping to get away from that.<br /><br />It is a book in the Delirium series. It is a dystopian series since it is a government-controlled society that says that love is a disease that must be eradicated.
B00BWI3NIU|3.0|I'm a huge Dido fan. But Girl Who got Away did sadly not live up the my expectations. There are some good songs, but most of them are rather dull. And this is not so much the fault of the song writing as of the production. And the production is not very good, especially the very boring/simple/dated drum/rhythm programming. And then we have an unfathomable mixing error that started on Safe Trip Home, but is even worse here, that Dido's vocals are way too loud in the mix. I love Dido's voice, but on this album, especially on most verses and softer parts in general, the loud vocals completely overpowers the music, which is why many of the songs and melodies sound the same.<br /><br />In country music it is customary to mix the vocals a bit louder than in pop music. But this is much louder than even the loudest country albums. And that says quite a lot. Unfortunately the loud vocals ruin many of the songs also because it makes it impossible to turn up the volume to the point where you can feel the music. The vocals are always louder, and this is truly a shame. I'm an audio engineer myself which is why I find this mistake so incredible.<br /><br />I think the major problem here is that Dido and Rollo have to much confidence in their production abilities and then have too much influence over the final mix and the production. This is quite evident when the production on the two songs produced by Greg Kurstin, are not very good either. In my opinion, Greg Kurstin is a genius and his productions always sound amazing. So I'm pretty sure he didn't have the final word here. She should have let Greg produce the whole album and let him have the last word on everything. Dido can sing beautifully and write incredible songs. But she's no producer. Maybe next time she can give full control to Greg. And that, my friends, could be her best album yet!
B00B2V66VS|4.0|I loved it . Right when I get comfortable with the game something new happened to blow me away !The giant Monkey and the scenes were better than Temple run 1..
0738711500|5.0|Usually when cards have a sheet with them they are less than impressive..this is not the case with these..I love the pictures.and the feel of them ..the sheet to practice with is a plus..this also is a great value....very colorful and insightful...B.W.
B00AHTYI5M|5.0|The movie was as good as advertised!  Without a doubt I will watch it again and I'll share it with family.
B00BJA2VFW|4.0|I had enjoyed playing this game. it is a very relaxing game. I even liked that some of the levelhad to be played a couple of times to get thrum them
B005GFPZYK|5.0|5 stars hands down! This shows the true backbone of successful wartime and elaborates on how all branches of the military work together. Chris Kyle was a true American warrior!
B000PKX2KA|5.0|The GPS receiver works fine, so happy. Just having some trouble getting the plotter software to recognize the right USB port GPS device is connected to. Another program recognizes it just fine. Not had time to fully troubleshoot the problem.
B008XG1X18|1.0|love!!!! unfortunately since having to reload and reinstall a few weeks ago, when I had to replace my kindle. Since reloading the app, it continuously runs slowly.  Most annoyingly, now everytime i select an item to pin, click &lt;like&gt;, click &lt;repin&gt;, try to update a description, or any othrr single action, I get pop up errors where I have to choose between &quot;force close&quot; and &quot;wait&quot;.  I have restarted several times. I'm going to uninstall and reinstall, but please look into this &amp; fix!
B000WYCF6Q|4.0|The mirror is good, adjusts easily, and provides a good view of other bikes coming up from behind. I only wish it was a little bigger.
B00C28J2VQ|1.0|This movie was pointless, and it made no sense! The only redeeming quality it has is the fact they got rid of the lips on Snakeyes mask. But that was literally the only thing this movie got right. Everything else in this movie is a waste of time and money. And to think they delayed this movie by almost a year, I shudder to think of the pile that first cut was. Save your money, the first flick was way better. And if that doesn't tell you everything you need to know about the quality of this film, I can't help you. Fork over your hard earned money sit back with a nice bowl of popcorn and get ready for a giant heaping bowl of disappointment!!!
B00ADQCBEY|5.0|My husband and I love this show.  The characters are easy to follow and the acting is great!  The stories are very real and something that I don't see every day and hopefully never will but that's what makes it intriguing.  It is different from other police shows because it follows politics in the precinct, two beat cops, a strike force, two detectives, and the captain, along with their personal lives.  I recommend this to anyone who wants to watch a different type of police series.
B007B6VOG0|4.0|Fun is a great band to listen to if you're in the mood for something upbeat and well, fun.  However, I do sometimes find Nate Ruess' voice a bit annoying, and the amount of auto-tune used is frustrating.
B000O599ZS|5.0|An epic classic in color. John Wayne & Jeffery Hunter at their best. A must have for collectors of westerns. Highly recommend.
B007M45PMU|4.0|The Lumineers are great to listen to if you're in the mood for something a bit more mellow.  This is generally my favorite genre of music, an I really enjoy the CD.  Mostly I enjoy the addition of their songs to my playlist.  I have a hard time listening to their CD by itself because the music starts to sound somewhat repetitive and boring.
0783110871|5.0|.Another plane ride with only one difference. Among the regular passengers it will be carrying two very special passengers-an armed robber and a seductive serial killer (Ray Liotta) both handcuffed and shackled and escorted by top security agents heading into a severe storm on Christmas Eve. The danger from outside is almost as deadly as the danger within. Fasten your seatbelts because this trip is gonna be a killer. This will definitly keep you on the edge of your seat. Yes I would recommend this.
B002DOSBMK|4.0|Well written and a good start to a hopefully good series. Will defiantly read the next books. Good book yeah
B009P5S11G|5.0|Rihanna is awesome. I loved this entire cd. It was delivered very fast and in great shape meeting all expectations. Many people will be able to relate to the words in the songs that Rihanna has put on this cd. Love her!
0425252868|5.0|My Mom's boyfriend purchased this for his grandson, and was dying to read it himself, but wanted to keep it in pristine condition as it was a gift.  I ordered it so he'd have his own copy.
B006OOHYIC|5.0|Great game, good controls and easy game play. Keeps you occupied for a few minutes or a few hours. Light on replay-ability but still challenging!
B007L6VR6M|5.0|I watched this with my wife. We laughed a lot. The humor is different and a love story between the 12 year-old couple can get a little uncomfortable to watch. I don't really know how to review this but it screams Wes Anderson. Watch it twice, or three times. Tons of detail to pick up on if you want.
B00BWJARHO|5.0|This movie holds to the high standard of the first three, and does not disappoint.  The characters were amazing and it held my attention to the end!  If you loved the Lord of the Rings, or if you loved the book, The Hobbit, you will love this.  I was pleased that they used the same actor for Gandalf as the previous movies, and I truly enjoyed Bilbo.  There was humor, and adventure and lots of fun characters.  I plan to own this movie and I highly recommend it!

B003JTHXOK|5.0|I loved this book. I saw the movie first which was pretty different so I suggest reading it first. Nicholas Sparks is an amazing writer and  I will try to read more of his books! MUST READ &#34;SAFE HAVEN&#34;!!!

1416955070|3.0|After seeing the preview for the film \\"City of Bones,\\" coming out this August, I decided to read the book and start myself on a new series.  I should have read the endorsement from Stephanie Meyer on the front of the book before reading so I knew what I was in for.<br /><br />The story revolves around a teenage girl, Clary, who witnesses a supernatural murder.  After a series of events, she finds herself thrust into a world of angels and demons in which her role is far more important than everyone (except the reader) foresees.  Clary discovers she is a Shadowhunter, or, a half-human, half-angel demon-killing machine.  Being the first book in a trilogy, City of Bones sets itself up for its sequels nicely, but ends in an anticlimactic and abrupt fashion.<br /><br />The first couple chapters sparked my interest, but it was mostly downhill from there.  The sentence structure was juvenile, which makes sense based on the target audience (teen girls who are normally not voracious readers).  The characters were thinly portrayed and leave a lot open to reader interpretation.  This quality might actually help the film version, as the director and actors can use creative license to really mold their own characters to whatever they wish.  About the only thing Cassandra Clare does well is end each chapter with a cliffhanger, enticing the reader to continue on their path to mindless entertainment.

B007VUA7VO|5.0|even though it doesn't make your battery life better, it tracks the amount of energy left in the battery and tells u how many minutes u have left to browse the web or play on apps or read. very useful and overall well put together app. plus, it is free, so don't buy the .99 cent version.
B00BJA2VFW|5.0|One of my favorite games. The graphics and quality are great. Very addictive and a lot of fun.<br />I would recommend this game for anyone.
B006GWO5NE|5.0|My kindle was down for a few days and I needed help. Got me up and running quickly. Thanks to great service
B00AREIAI8|4.0|This is a fun app with lots of features. My only complaint is the pop up ads the appear all the time, even when you are in the middle of competing.
B001BANK32|4.0|Wonderful story, especially fun to read when you're going to visit the Stanley Hotel in Estes Park!<br /><br />There were a few typos here and there in the Kindle edition, but only small errors that you could easily figure out what was intended.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|So well written and suspenseful with interesting twists! My new favorite author! The pacing of the book was really nice. Not rushed but not dragging.
B004OR199G|5.0|Ladies, you will not find a book out there that is so full of valuable information about truly changing your life and empowering change. It is funny, insightful and daringly true. I recommended to to every woman who wants to take back her life, power and beauty.
B0034DGPEU|5.0|Although the subject of slavery is difficult to read about, the author did a wonderful job of telling this story, alternating between two different viewpoints.  It is a well-written book with well-developed characters. The book draws you into the story so that you don't want to put it down and wait to find out what happens next.  You want to keep reading.

B00BSBY38A|3.0|Not a fabulous film, but good eye candy. Did not see how the experience could make someone believe in God.
B00BB8RKH6|4.0|This movie had a great message and was enjoyable from beginning to end. Loved Denzel and John Goodman - both of them were AMAZING in this.
B000GH2YL0|4.0|I enjoy reading exciting true-life stories and this does not disappoint. They might have made a movie out of it.
B00AE2LJVS|5.0|This was a unique true story that takes place during prohibition and focuses primarily on the three Bondurant brothers and their bootlegging business. The acting is incredible and the relationships between characters are convincing.  There is a good deal of blood and violence which truly warrants the &#34;R&#34; rating. Not a movie for the feint, but an excellent representation of history during that time period as well as loyalty between brothers.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|This is an amazing account of what took place in the bin Laden compound as well as the sacrifices our soldiers make every day. I couldn't put this book down.
B00BGZ8OLA|5.0|I was a little worried at the beginning of Pi (first 5 minutes or so) as I thought the dialogue was a little slow. Then, Pi began his journey and I was entranced. At the end of the movie, I felt that it was one of the best movies I had ever seen and I realized the dialogue was, in fact, necessary and an important part of the tale.  This is an extremely unique movie with incredible characters, humor, sadness, and thought provoking moments all rolled into one.  The Life of Pi is a fantastic escape from the violent, floor shaking movies we have grown used to. Instead, The Life of Pi takes us on a life journey of self preservation and, does it so beautifully and with such entertaining script that, in the end, we don't even know we've been on a journey. A tale that I am certain will become a classic.
B007W1BLN0|4.0|I've always thought this movie was captivating from start to finish. A little disappointed that the result romanticized the young man's journey to &#60;spoiler left out&#62;, and inspired copycat trips; but luckily, to my knowledge, did not result in the same fate.  The book is an excellent read and will fill in what blanks can be filled by this story which is told from the standpoint mainly of what an investigator could piece together.<br />I recommend it for adults, and for teenagers with adult supervision.
1572814349|5.0|This deck was even better then I thought it would be!!! I was not expecting such attention to detail and the beautiful cards. I am very pleased with this purchase and would recommend this to all my friends..
B00571F26Y|5.0|The author (Doctor) presents a good case for why we are so fat in our bellies. My friends told me about this book and after listening to their stories over the past few months, decided to read this one myself.<br />It is great how the author backs up her information with related studies. She takes you through how our foods have changed over the past century and how it is affecting our health. The truth was hard to swallow at first, but now after seeing my friends lives change to the healthy by following the diet structure, I am now a believer.<br />I am so glad there is a companion cook book to go with this one. I intend on purchasing that one next.
B009UNGYHG|5.0|This case is perfect., I charge my earbud in it, then toss it in my purse until I'm ready to use my earbud.<br />Great product that I think everyone should have.  This is the first time I've actually had a worry free ear bud and I always know where it is.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This story grabbed me from the beginning. The first part of the book seemed a little familiar (similar to the Fifty Shades of Gray attraction), but that soon changed. The author throws curve balls and shocks you throughout the story. I couldn't guess what was coming next and how the characters would respond. It was extremely well written, in my opinion.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|in my opinion is this game I like because it is not like tempel run were you half to lean it.
B007IXWKUK|4.0|I thought this book was a very good story, and I cannot wait for the next one. The only reason I gave four stars is because it is poorly written. I'm not usually a stickler on that sort of thing, but I found many mistakes...so it had to be said
030758836X|2.0|I just read 469 pages of Gone Girl in two days because i couldn't put it down. But now that I've finished I am so disappointed in Gillian Flynn for making us read this whole book to get to that ending. It was like she had written herself into a corner and didn't know how to get out. Although, i could see several ways that she could've ended the story. i seriously think that she just wanted to seem so clever, but it just came off as so unbelievable. Even more than the last few chapters were poorly written compared to the rest of the book. Its hard to really write a review without some spoiler alerts and I wouldn't want to ruin it for anyone else out there. Just a warning, this book is really not a thriller. it is suspenseful at first but becomes long and drawn out to an incredibly unsatisfying ending, alot of things/details are repeated over and over. i hope that when they make the movie, I read that she is writing the screeplay too, that the producers make her change the ending, although i could definitely see this more as a movie (the ending) than as an end to a written story.
0547848412|5.0|I was looking for a great adventure story when I bought Life of Pi; and that's exactly what I got! This book had it all, wonder, spirituality, action, worry, etc. You really felt like you were a part of the story. So if you're thirsty for a change in direction like I was, you'll be smart to let this be the book be the one that quenches it!
B006LSZECO|3.0|I started slow, then it sucked me in. I kept thinking, why did he do it?  Then the story turned and I couldn't put it down...then the ending.  I would have rated higher but the characters got too weird at the end.

0240815807|5.0|I will just start out by saying you can't go wrong buying this book.  Unless you have been grandfathered in by someone who REALLY knows what they are doing, or went to school and spent countless dollars then there is a possibility you know everything in this book.  Even still, the vets could learn something here.  All of the advice is clear and helpful.  I have had the book for a while now and have read a good majority of it.  I will find myself just turning to a page or skipping ahead and just reading little tidbits and those little tidbits are gold.  Mike Senior is a very smart man and has a pretty strong portfolio.  All you have to do is google him, read his column in sound on sound magazine, or check him out on the soundonsound.com forums.  He is legit and learning from him is a privilege.  This book is really for anyone who has not already recorded a gold or platinum album.  Hope this helps!
B006VFLIYK|5.0|As with almost all of his books, this opens with an improbable scenario then adds yet another unlikely situation.<br /><br />He marries these two situations into an unbelievably intense story/mystery that has the reader turning pages as fast as they can.<br /><br />I highly recommend this book.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Hugh Howey has written a classic.  Once in a while, an author hits one out of the park, transcending their genre, appealing to the masses on the deepest level of our shared humanity.  Howey is one of those authors, and in his book Wool, he's given us more than just the story of a group of people living in a giant silo in order to preserve the human race from the mysterious disaster that has befallen Earth.<br /><br />Multigenerational families occupy a 140+ story, cement silo, hidden underground from the poisonous winds that howl outside, killing instantly anyone unfortunate enough to breathe them.  The story starts off with the gripping story of Holston, the honorable sheriff of the silo, who for some unfathomable reason, volunteers to go outside the silo to 'clean' the lenses that give the populace a view of the black clouds that roll through the dark, polluted sky.  It's a one-way trip, one Holston's wife took 3 years ago for saying the forbidden words, \\"I want out\\".<br /><br />Made up of 5 sections, Wool tells the story of Silo 18, and the people who live in it.  Gripping doesn't begin to convey what happens in this novel of what might happen to us in the future.  Told by a master-story teller, Wool is one of those books grabs you and doesn't let go, which I unfortunately found out while on vacation.  But then, who needs sleep when you can be whisked away into a future world so realistic that you start checking the news to see it we're getting close to the same scenario.<br /><br />I loved the characters.  Howey gives us both honorable men, like the Sheriff, and despicable men, though as a I read, I started to see that it's a fine line between doing what's right, and doing what is best.  I loved the character of Juliette.  She's strong, hiding a secret hurt under layers of competence until she's called on to save the silo.  And then we have to ask, is the silo worth saving?  Is it worth saving the human race if they have to live underground for untold generations?<br /><br />Howey doesn't shy away from the hard questions as he entertains his audience with the lives of compelling characters who live and breath in our minds, but he doesn't hit you over the head with them.  There's a message in Wool, in fact, there are layered messages depending on how much you want to get out of his fine book.  More than anything, Wool reminds me of the Tolkien series with its flawed heroes, and  sympathetic villains.  It's man against nature-man against machine-and mostly man against himself, as we watch the story unfold.<br /><br />This is book you'll never forget, and if it's not been optioned for a movie yet, someone is not paying attention.<br /><br />I'm now reading the prequel to Wool, First Shift-Legacy part 6 of the Wool series which tells why the silos came into being in the first place.  I can foresee myself reading everything Howey has ever written.  I love finding great new authors.s?<br /><br />Howey doesn't shy away from the hard questions as he entertains his audience with the lives of compelling characters who live and breath in our minds, but he doesn't hit you over the head with them.

B008VVT51U|5.0|British talent interacting in some of the best scenes ever, the movie centers on retirees who are attempting to stretch their incomes by escaping the high prices in England and moving to the &#34;Best Exotic Marigold Hotel,&#34; located in India.  Imagine their surprise in finding a run-down, ramshackle, not-really inhabitable building run by a young dreamer who has little, if any business experience or talent.<br /><br />The story centers on how each of the retirees,the dreamer, his girlfriend, and their families cope with the circumstances that crop up as they try or refuse to try and make the situation work.  Funny, charming, and filled with scenes from the colorful streets of India, this film was enchanting and delightful.<br /><br />With Dames Judi Dench and Maggie Smith paired with Tom Wilkinson, Bill Nighy, and Penelope Wilton, one could not expect less than stellar performances and magical chemistry.  That is exactly what the viewer gets.  Add Ronald Pickup, Celia Imrie, and Dev Patel to round out the cast, and the cast just gets better and better.  Patel is charming as the inept hotel owner/manger/boyfriend, and he is perfectly cast along with his screen family.  The balance of personalities in this film could not be better.<br /><br />if you have not yet seen this film, go now and either rent or buy it.  It is absolutely delightful.

B00BHMETKC|4.0|I did enjoy this film, but perhaps because we saw it after the awards season and the considerable hype surrounding it, I didn't find it to be nearly as powerful as I had expected. It's an incredible story, certainly very dramatic, but the telling of it lacked the emotional tug I thought it would have. I'm not sure that Ben Affleck should have been the one to play the key role...he's a talented director and did a fine job with a complicated story, but I found his understated performance left a bit to be desired. Too low key maybe?  I may give it another viewing, though, as the first was a late, late show.
B0070Y46UY|5.0|It was a good read. I wanted to read it before seeing the movie. I liked the way it was written and the sound of the authors voice..

B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|At first, the book just seems to hop on the latest bandwagon of socially acceptable &#34;smut,&#34; as I like to call romance novels.  But after it delves more into the backstory, it gets better and is less fluffy than you expect.<br /><br />For some easy, light reading, I recommend this book.

B00BJO5SXK|5.0|This has to be Tyler's best work since Bastard. He's matured a lot and on this album it feels like he changed his style, but it also feels like it's the same Tyler. He doesn't have all the rape and satanic lyrics, but it's still dark. This album has way more meaning and was more lyrical than Goblin. For the most part, the album has a more serious tone and the stories he tells throughout the album is amazing. This is the best album I've heard so far this year and I advise anyone who thought Tyler's old lyrics were too much for them to try out this album.
B008476HBM|5.0|I love reading, and this book is one of my favorites! It is so descriptive that while reading you may find your imagination drifting of in the time the story is written and for moments you live in middle of all the traditional (ridiculous) rules.

B009IEXKXI|5.0|Very entertaining book. I can well imagine many of the events taking place in real life. The author seems to have followed NASA closely.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Cute game.  Grandkids love it!  As far as games goes it rates as good and any other games that are available.
B005BRS8Z6|5.0|I read this book many years ago when it was first published.  I have gifted several loved ones with this special book, suggesting they read it with an open, nonjudgmental mind.  The real beauty of The  Four Agreements lies in the simplicity of the lessons within. I have read it more than once because adopting these agreements requires practice and support. Most of us over think everything, which leaves us anxious and unsure.  Honoring these agreements has changed my life for the better, which is simply the highest recommendation I can give for any book.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|This book was hands down the wost book I have ever read.  Ignoring the story line that lacks any originality, and the flat, bland characters, the redundancy and raw immaturity of the writing makes the book nearly unreadable. I often finish books or a series of books that I do not like, just to see where the story goes or if it will get better.  With this book, I did not care, and did not purchase the next two books. Well whaddya know - growth.  I guess I got something out of this horribly written slop after all.
B002WV5A9G|5.0|How could you not love this film?  It captured the humor and relationships in the original series -- and this Spock looks so much like a young Leonard Nimoy!  Suspense, great special effects, good plot.  Just fabulous!
B006IYG5HE|5.0|Multi-faceted and intertwined; a Jo Nesbo classic. A great window into the political arena of Norway.  I highly recommed it.
B00821PCJS|4.0|When I found this series from TNT on Amazon Prime, I was somewhat skeptical. I hadn't heard of an original series on TNT, and generally don't make it a first stop when channel scanning.<br /><br />What a pleasant surprise to find a well written, well-acted story with lots of edge-of-your-seat thrills and action.<br /><br />Sci-fi lovers will definitely want to check this one out.
B00011CZRE|5.0|A great cast, great plot and terrifying ending.  Who doesn't like to be scared out of their wits??  I don't watch movies twice; I watched this one twice.
B008BO61BE|5.0|All the Metal planets aligned when Judas Priest released SFV.  This album contains some of the tastiest, bone crushing metal ever recorded and at the same time contained the mega radio hit the Priest were always striving for with \\"You Got another Thing Coming.\\"  That single anchored, for better or worse, Priest firmly into the mainstream spotlight and made them a household name.  Over all, the album is brilliant and is another must have for any metal fan.  Unfortunately, it's massive success would eventually pull Judas Priest off-course into an even more mainstream direction.
B004IY6API|5.0|Stained Class was my introduction to Judas Priest and the music sent shivers down my spine the first time I heard it on 8 track (Yes, I'm old!).  Decades later the album holds up to anything coming out today.  \\"Stained Class\\"  defines what modern Heavy Metal would become and where it was headed.  This is a must have album for anyone into heavy metal.  One side note, Unfortunately, most of this album was never featured in live shows over the years with the exception of Exciter and Beyond The Realms Of Death which is a real shame for such a landmark album.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|After reading the first book and this one, I just wanted to get the part 3 of this book. It's so interesting I can't put it down. Will recommend this book any time.
B007SGM084|5.0|This is one book that I can never forget in a hurry. The writer is the best writer ever. Love the story line. I will recommend this book to my friends
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I leave very few reviews, but this book was excellent.  I loved the slammed series, and loved all the real in it.  This one is no different.  I loves this book from the beginning and couldn't put it down.  i laughed and cried and fell absolutely in love with the characters.  This book is worth the purchase and will have anyone lost in it till the end!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Subway surf is a very phone game. Me, my brothers,cousins,and friend all enjoy it. We can play it all day long. we love to challenge each other. You would really enjoy it too.
B0091REZMW|5.0|it a fun game to play and would recommend the game to anyone who likes brain teasers go play the game
B000IZAHB4|4.0|this movie put a smile on my face becuse i loved action very creative and fun to see on my laptop
0988262592|4.0|Nice read.  And recommended it to my colleagues and staff.  I doubt I would've gotten it unless it was offered for free.  Kudos to the author for a nicely written book.
8866130931|5.0|I can't live without my old school moleskin.  Yep, it's back up for my iphone calendar.  I use it mostly to jot down notes and keep up with work notes.  Perfect size!
B000HZD168|5.0|I will avenge thee!!! Khan!!! Love it...Never gets old or out of date. Poor Bones with Spock lodged in his head!
B000VFGSI2|1.0|These recordings have always been controversial. I hated them and needed to listen to Rubenstein to cleanse my auditory palate
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Author Howey did a great job. The story moves along and except for a couple times, needing to really suspend disbelief, it was engaging. The central idea  around the Silos is all too possible.
B004J4WLB4|5.0|I thought the author did a great job with this story.  It captured me and I thought it was very well written.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|different ones told me about this book and how good it was and it was as good as I was told
B00BJ9VBLI|3.0|This is a fun game mostly just match-three type.<br />You try to build houses but they are hard to see even on my new Fire HD 8.9.<br />Pretty quickly I used all the free trial and it wouldn't play any further unless I purchased it for $1.99<br />Not really too bad, I probably will buy it .
B007IXWKUK|5.0|this one is as good as the first one I didn't want to put it down once I started reading
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I could not put this book down. Well crafted and thought out. If you are looking for something new get this.
B001MTENOC|3.0|Gets a little repetitive...haven't finished it yet.  Maybe it will improve but not compelled to really finish it at one sitting.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|I absolutely loved this book. When I got done reading it, I freaked out. I cried when he had his depression moments, and I laughed at his funny moments. This book spoke to me. I'm not a wallflower, but it just spoke to me...
B006MW3UZW|5.0|IT has been a long time since I've watched such smart television. It's a great series for all fans of UK shows.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|This show is great, though we're at the end of the second season and the third isn't available on Prime yet.
B001QJUX24|5.0|probably the best western ever, based on a true story, with artistic license, great scenery, suspense, showcases the good and bad in peopel
B0083DJWGO|5.0|A great follow up to Black Swan with further examples and a deeper dive into randomness. A must read for any citizen of the world.
B00338QENI|3.0|I read this because I am interesting in good science writing. This book blends the science story with the personal and familial  story of Henrietta Lacks.  The book is a case history of questionable medical and legal ethics which the author delineates clearly without too much bias. She also covers the history of the growing of cancer cells in vitro in an understandable way. My one criticism about the book is that Henrietta and her family is a study in poverty stricken  underclass dysfunction which starts to read like a script for the Jerry Springer show, and  ironically, the story instantiates many of the stereo typical archetypes of these benighted folks.
B00C1E8E7E|3.0|The Creator Tyler is a good rapper.  He's actually quite amazing.<br /><br />However, the content just isn't to my taste these days.  Hit me up in my early 20s when I was looking for influence - then yes.  But now a days, I don't want to know about how much cocaine you do and sell.  Your an idiot man.  Just - not positive, but hate is what this guy is pushing.
B003YL4L0W|3.0|I read this after The Storyteller hoping that I had missed an excellent story.  I felt Picoult was trying to find an audience too hard and she missed the opportunity to tell an important story.  It was just hard to accept the fertilization difficulties, the alcoholism, and the lesbian couple in one book.  Maybe if one character was somewhat boring and normal that would have provided a link.
B009GQ57ES|5.0|Sings about gay rights, sings about childhood experiences, and just good things.  He's a smart man and I'm glad he's doing well; he deserves it.  His voice needs to be heard more.  These radio stations need to stop silencing those who don't sell out to mainstream record labels.  The underground has so much more to offer than what you hear on the radio daily.<br /><br />Mackelmore is an artist who is positive, thinks poetically, and sings in ways that don't promote hate, violence, drugs, or any of the crap all these other &#34;rappers&#34; do.  It's funny - I wish I would've had someone like him to grow up to.  Instead, I had Eminem, Jay Z, The Game, and a lot of other negative - I wanna sell drugs/kill this/hate that group.<br /><br />Granted they are good - just selling hate.  If you want to see a good rapper who doesn't have to promote that - Mackelmore & Ryan Lewis is your artist.  I love these guys!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|My eleven year old granddaughter and her seven year old brother really enjoy this.  I do try to convey that defacing public property is indeed illegal.
B004EPZ084|4.0|It was quirky and funny and I enjoyed the movie.  A little bit of cussing but not bad and  very entertaining.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|What a delightful book full of insight in the lives of teenage cancer victims.  John Green really was spot on with the lingo and lifestyles of the young and sick.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Author gets right to the meat,no repetitive catch phrases,pits the reader in at the first chapter,very fun mystery,well thought out
B00BHMETKC|4.0|This story needed to be told.  Thank goodness Ben Affleck brought it to the American Public.  I highly recommend watching it.
B00ABGEFWC|3.0|the pets are hard to level up, its SUPER hard to earn gems and the quests are as hard as butts! its a little fun if you have a credit card.
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|This, by far is the best hungry shark ever, really enjoyable m give it a try, it won't hurt plus, you won't regret it.

B0064MGU98|5.0|This is a great show and hard to stop watching! So glad amazon prime added it to its offerings. Must watch!
B00846WWVM|1.0|I got this as a FAOTD &amp; glad I did not pay for it.  I played a couple of games &amp; just can't bring myself to open it again.  I found no entertainment whatsoever.  I was frustrated by the controls since they're important &amp; make a difference in how well you score at the end.  I don't understand how the fireballs work &amp; relight themselves to come up with a good game plan.  It's now taking up space on my phone so time to delete it.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|The kind of book that gives you little information in the beginning and fills in the gaps as it goes along.  Great ending and you really fall in love with the characters.
B007MCTTHY|4.0|I got this as a FAOTD &amp; wasn't expecting it to be all that good since this type of game has been done thousands of times.  It was a lot better than I expected BUT it still was ruined by the years of other games like this.  This was one of the first games &amp; there wasn't that many available at first so it was that  or minesweeper.  This version is like most others but you have to change the colors, create colors, change colors back, &amp; have multiple starting &amp; ending points.  I am not sure how to make this game any better without changing it entirely but the dev did pretty well.  This is a keeper that I will play when I am super bored &amp; tired of my other games.  Unfortunately, I get stuck on the harder levels &amp; have to come back to them sometimes
B005HQ5S3G|5.0|But when I do, I try to support freedom loving Americans that speak truthfully and honestly, not many like that these days.
B00BL5EQLC|3.0|I got this as the FAOTD &amp; was actually very disappointed once I started playing it.  The controls didn't always react correctly.  I kept getting frfrustrated playing the same easy level over &amp; over again because the game didn't react the way it was suppose to.  The scenes are not that creative &amp; the game play is quite repetitive.  I can't bring myself to play it again.  It's just not for me.  There's a lot more of these types of games on the market that are much more creative &amp; that work properly.  Also, they're free!  This might be good for a young kid but I can see them getting angry with the controls as well.  I do like that you can reverse your direction to go back &amp; get something you missed.
B0030Y11XS|5.0|I love Michael Moore. His movies are so interesting. He asks questions I would ask. He wants to know answers to questions just like I do. How could this have happened? Where did capitalism go wrong? If unchecked, it can bring our country down. Excellent movie!
B007N6NGYG|2.0|I got this as the FAOTD.  I was excited to see a different try on plumber.  At first it was fun.  I really was enjoying trying to figure it out BUT the menu buttons cover areas of the screen that I need to be able to see before playing.  The game is too fast, at times, to try figuring everything out when the game begins.  I like to know where the trains start &amp; stop.  The end screen covers up most of the screen so you can't see it then either.  As it progresses the trains start in tunnels so you just don't know, then have to control 4 trains at once.  When they go back into the tunnels you don't know where they're going or where they'll come out.  The game doesn't slowly bring this on either!  That's when I decided to stop playing it.  It was too much going on at once to remember what train started where &amp; which tunnel leads to what.  I know that it's part of the game to work on the spot as issues arise but I don't want to play a level a hundred times just to know the lay out.  I am not dumb or slow in anyway so I can imagine this being a problem for a lot of people.  It really did start out great but then it threw too much on me at once &amp; I lost interest.
B003TSEEDY|4.0|It's a really good read, you can relate to either one or multiple characters and makes you feel you're part of the book
B00AK0X5VQ|5.0|I got this as the FAOTD &amp; really enjoyed playing it this far.  The graphics are beautiful &amp; relaxing.  The sound is pleasurable &amp; relaxing as well but I never keep the sound on my games anyways.  The game starts out pretty easy but does get more difficult.  I can see where people say the game is relaxing but it's still a game where you can die &amp; start over again.  The game is easy to get lost in &amp; take your mind off of things around you so that would be the relaxing part but if you're overly sensitive to dying in games then it may not be so relaxing for you but that doesn't mean it won't be enjoyable.  It's a great idea &amp; great game in my opinion.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|love it keeps me bizy<br />it's fun to<br />I bet you that you will like to<br />I love to play it in the car
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|This is seriously some of the best television I have seen in a long time.  The character have a rich depth to them and the story line is riveting.  Absolutely amazing series!
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|It's Angry Birds, of course it's fun. This game could keep someone occupied for hours. It is almost annoyingly addictive.
B005LAIIQC|3.0|the movie was ok  action scences looked very good renner done a good job but i think damon was born to play bourne. i believe matt's opened the door to come back to play him how dam good would it be if they could team they both up with some of the origanal players well the ones that are left anyway.that would be an big box office hit if ever i'v seen one two men on the run two woman if they got styles to play i'd go twice to see it in cased i missed something the first time. well from aussie willie until next time

B007IXWKUK|5.0|easy to read, obviously you should have rode the previous books. Not a believable history, sure, but a funny and relaxing one.
B00BS4PF0C|5.0|Blake's new album is everything I enjoy about country music.  There are some beautiful ballads and some foot stompin' honky tonk music.  If you don't already love Blake and the music he makes, I'm pretty sure this album will put you over the edge.

B009GQ57ES|5.0|I love this album. I've been listening to it non stop since I bought it. Plus I love everything about macklemore. He's a great artist who didn't sell out to the bug record labels and raps about things that matter.
0439023513|1.0|Without spoiling anything, I dislike books where the plot actions have no meaning or impact, where choices and sacrifices mean nothing, and where love triangles are conveintently decided not by insight or action, but poor chance and coincidence. Choice is the foundation of story telling and is present in all life regardless of circumstance, choice is not a strong element in this book. Just because a book causes you to have an emotional reaction does not make it good. The only reason this book is rated as a 4 is because there are enough defenders of the overhyped train this series has become to negate the initial response of 3-3.5 stars that existed before the movies and promotions began.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|My android phone, my Kindle Fire, My ipad mini and my windows devices all have this app installed.  Seamless syncing through all the devices, encoded notes, and that is just the beginning for this fantastic FREE app.  A must have.

B00884GR0W|1.0|Perhaps cause I have an older Android that couldn't keep up with the graphics. Seemed like it might be cool if the processor would keep up.
B002RKSZWG|5.0|A young woman, dissuaded from marrying a poor sailor by a family friend, crosses his path eight years later.  But by now her self-indulgent family is used to placing demands on her that theaten to ensure she becomes an &#34;old maid.&#34;  And her former suiter, now a prosperous naval officer, is being actively pursued by sweet young things who have at least one advantage over our heroine - they've never disappointed him.<br /><br />Certain themes in the book convince me that it's the most autobiographical of Austen's novels.  For example, the book exposes the faults of nearly every character - sometimes savagely.  But whenever the interfering &#34;family friend&#34; is mentioned, Austen rushes to explain that her guidance came from the best motives. Once would have been enough.  Twice would have been overkill.  But EVERY TIME?  My guess is that young Jane Austen had such an advisor, whose interference she did resent, but whom she felt guilty representing negatively in any way.<br /><br />Both BBC adaptations of this book are worth watching - however I'll warn you that the first one uses celebrated stage actors who may seem slightly miscast for the &#34;small screen.&#34;<br /><br />Paul Race - School of the Rock
B00AAQVSDW|5.0|Roll them windows down and cruz, need I say more. Great album and well worth the price that I got it for.
B004ZJZPXO|5.0|Firefly was more or less a western in space with the addition of a &#34;Foundation and Empire&#34;-sized backstory and deadly government conspiracies.  One thing that made the series work was the well-rounded, interesting characters.<br />Unlike some shows with huge overarching plot arcs, EVERY episode had a real plot, and not the Lost-style meandering where nothing actually happens.  But Whedon WAS building toward a conclusion of sorts, and his overall plans were truncated when the series was cancelled so quickly that they didn't even have funding to write a &#34;wrap-up&#34; episode.  Fans demanded more, and a movie got produced.  As a Firefly fan, I enjoyed seeing a certain percentage of the &#34;plot arcs&#34; come to a satisfactory conclusion.  You see Malcom, who had &#34;lost his religion&#34; before the second scene of Episode 1 regaining a sense of purpose that overrides all other concerns.  At least part of the conspiracy that has unhinged River is exposed.  And the other characters &#34;rise to the occassion,&#34; even the mercenary Jayne, who hesitates to admit that they're all in over their heads.<br /><br />Still, it's far more than JUST a wrap-up two-hour episode of the series.  For one thing, it's a lot bigger.  Bigger emotionally, bigger in scope, and bigger in sheer size.<br /><br />If you like science fiction in general, you'll probably like this movie enough to go back and watch the series, then watch the series again.  If you liked Firefly, you'll love this movie.<br /><br />Paul Race - Faith and Fantasy
B00BSBU4EC|3.0|The twin 5 year olds loved it; they want to buy the movie. It was barely tolerable for the parents....
B004SD5GZ4|3.0|No big deal.  I just downloaded it because I had to and it works as designed.  If you ever want to read a pdf on your handheld, you'll probably need it.

B008NIS2SS|5.0|This is a fabulous collection of Bill Evan's work and the sound quality is excellent. The price couldn't be better-great deal, highly recommended!!
B0081336FO|5.0|I have truly enjoyed wathching the Sherlock Holmes series. The acting is great and I enjoy British television shows. For one thing, unlike Hollywood, the actors are all &#34;normal looking&#34; people, as opposed to the plastic, overly Botoxed look of many American actors. The HD is wonderful.
B00ADQCBEY|1.0|This series is contrived, unbelievable conflict, and the background sounds are really, really irritating. I watched two shows and turned it off halfway through the second one. I give it two thumbs down.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|show still keeps you drawn in. each episodes piles on the zombie charm. It is a must see. start with season 1 and keep chugging along. It is well worth it.
B0020BUWX2|5.0|Great story, wonderfully written. I couldn't put it down. Finished in one day. A friend recommended this book and so glad.  Loved it. Can't wait to read more by this author.

1250027624|5.0|Once I started watching this series, I could not stop.  It is very interesting, the costumes and decor were beautiful and showed another era I was not privy of before.  Highly recommend.

B008ODZEQ0|5.0|Great personality profile of an individual who is always striving for excellence and has an endless capacity for work. Great movie for those exploring the connection between one's work and the meaning of life........
B00APUQT7I|2.0|I have such a soft spot for animation that I'm overly generous with applause if there's even the slightest sign of a work being created with genuine loving care, joy, excitement and inspiration.  This Ice Age has none of those things.<br /><br />We all knew they couldn't keep it fresh and creative forever; this episode signals they're out of ideas, out of story, out of dialogue, out of characters, out of steam and just don't care anymore.  The formula for this one seems to be \\"Let's jam it with a wagonload of uninteresting new animals to make up for being unable to create a single new fresh, fun and funny character.\\"  They also kept the pace at a frenetic speed so viewers have no time to think about how predictable and cliche every action and phrase really is.  They could have not bothered stamping out this assembly-line entry at all, and would have ended up with the same result; a totally unmemorable speed-race through a blur of storyless scenes.<br /><br />Denis Leary's tough-talking tiger character finally gets a girlfriend, but even here, very little effort was put into her graphic design and dialogue to make her the slightest bit special.  Remember the adorable baby in episode #1?  And the fantabulously sparkling British/Aussie jungle guide from another episode?  Of course you do.  This sequel has none of that memorable creativity, being utterly void of charm and delight.  It's only merciful act was being over and done in a flash, relieving the audience quickly of its boring misery.<br /><br />Ice Age is officially extinct.
B000FBJAEG|5.0|I literally cannot stand to put down a novel by Mr. Baldacci.  I've read several twice and enjoy it as well the second time around.  He's a terrific author.<br /><br />Marge Elza
1451695195|5.0|I have read innumerable books on the subject but &#34;Proof of Heaven&#34; is the most realistic and outstanding and fascinating book about the spiritual world.<br />Dr. Alexander doesn't talk about religion (although Jesus, Budha..Khrisna exist) and describes a world that is so real and close to  what the Vedas of ovear 5000 years ago talk about.<br />Thank you Dr. Alexander for such a great book.
B00C1BU7V8|3.0|The acting was fantastic and was a true lesson of what makes a great actor. But the content failed to hold ones interest for 2 1/2 hours. The movie should have been reduced from 2 1/2 hours down to an 1 hour documentary.
B001ANSSDC|3.0|I read this story because of the hype it got at the Oscars.  I found parts of the story hard to follow.
B00946WM6Q|5.0|I really enjoy this movie, one of my favorite Bond films. The HD is great but you have to watch it on select devices, which is not as awesome but it does come with the SD version as well.
B009YBU8CQ|3.0|This is a well written novel which depicts some quite serious issues in African culture. It's a heavy read though and you need to be in the mood for some serious issues to enjoy this book.
B006MW3UZW|4.0|The show is surprisingly enjoyable, despite the subject matter. The character make this show as they are forced to deal with a world that is changing around them. Those that do not fall by the wayside.
B004INHTK4|5.0|I really enjoyed this read. I worked in Asia for a while and it really depicts a lot of Asian moms. But I loved her sense of humour and how she could laugh at herself and some of her techniques. I think it's informative but still down-to-earth. A good one.
B004HXIZVC|1.0|Wont play crashes and keeps signing me out i cant take it i really hoped it would work sheesh ugh
B004XJRQUQ|4.0|While the trilogy is meant for younger readers, older people can certainly enjoy it, as I did.  I can certainly recommend it for all.
1582701709|3.0|THe Secret has been taught by Unity and other new thought religions for over a century. Norman Vincent Peele was better.

B00APJLFEG|1.0|Really wished I had option of selecting zero stars. My movie I ordered came in Spanish. Had been watching amazon all day and my shows were in english, then I ordered hotel transylvania, movie was in Spanish, and I don't understand spanish!!! Pretty mad, me and kids were excited to see movie!
B0095ZQ36G|5.0|Great, true story of flying B -17s and Bf 109s in Worl War II interwoven into an act of great chivalry that brought two foes back together again 50 years later. A great read.
B001NLL8LA|5.0|Having been reading the Reacher series, I found this one to be one of the best in that without the following of the narrative, you second guess incorrectly as to the forthcoming events.  A great read.
B004UPANGM|1.0|Terrible over acting! Not sure some things like the scene with the skeleton was supposed to be scary or funny. Wish there were a way to get a refund on the money spent! (alas but the time is lost for ever!)
B005LAIHY0|5.0|I have seen All the Alien Movies since they came out. this Prequel dose not let you down and even answers a few questions about who, what, where, when, and how.
B009BJAPLK|5.0|I enjoy the show very much. I love the way they play out each mystery... I hope they continue producing
B0063GORYU|4.0|simple but it makes you think through problems. you can just tap without thinking but what does that prove? its fun when you think you are stuck but somehow find a way through.

0671027344|5.0|This book changed my perspective and opened my eyes to a lot of things.  I loved the main character, Charlie, and how much he developed throughout the story despite the troubles he has been through.  I laughed, I cried, I covered my eyes in fear or anxiety for Charlie.  While reading this I truly felt like Charlie and I were friends and I was sad but happy to know he wouldn't be writing me anymore.  I recommend this to young adults everywhere.
B004U8VUUC|2.0|It  seems like they spent about 20 min coming up with the plot of the movie.  Ryan Goslings character was very interesting but they needed to elaborate more.
B004WGGQPQ|4.0|its a great app for drawing the reason i gave it a 4 star is because u cant type i really wish u could because when i use the marker to draw words it isn't clear and u cant read it
B000JMKQX0|2.0|First,not at all what I was expecting. I don't know if it was just the format,but from all the reviews I had read and heard,I was pretty let down by the book. Hopefully the movie does it for me.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is my life I play it in the bus when I get home from school during dinner sometimes at my brothers blaring football games EVERYWHERE!!!!!!!!
B007L3BMGA|3.0|Not the kind of story that I would normally read, however it was somewhat entertaining, but not as good as what I thought it would be with all the publicity that it received.
B00BMUYLSE|3.0|A good album with some strong vocal performances from Bowie. It's certainly not one of his best, but it is a solid, enjoyable record. Bowie fans will like it.
B007J4T2G8|2.0|Everyone I talked to about reading this book said it was very erotic.  I guess it was in a way but it read like a pornographic Harlequin romance to me.  It didn't make me want to read the whole series.
B0060MYM7O|5.0|Cannot say enough good things about it!  AMAZING!  Can't wait to see how the writers will translate the books to screen!
B005HHSXP0|5.0|This was an amazing book. I was glad to see Percy again, and Nico! This series just gets better and better. LOVE YOU RICK RIODAN &#60;3

B008U7ZPHS|5.0|I hate you Rick. I can't believe we had to wait a YEAR for the next to come out, especially on that horrible cliffhanger.
B008JEJPSC|5.0|Where they go to Radio City Music Hall, they watch Camille. First it is show in wide screen, which did not exist, so they cut off the top and bottom of the image. Second, their source material was extremely grainy and the film needs to have a restored version inserted. Watching the blurry, grainy images just takes you out of the film.
B0031Q0XCA|5.0|if one has ever experienced one-side love and wondered if it will always be that way... this movie will give you hope
B004DLPXAO|5.0|who needs to carry a kindlefire or ipad when you can have kindle right on your cell phone?  i just love being able to read a book on my cell phone while waiting in an office or riding on a bus, relaxing at home or elsewhere.  I find my cell screen is just the right size for reading and of course my cell is always with me so no need to carry anything else!
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|I've had this game for not that long..but it's a great/fun game..it's really challenging..I definitely would recommend this app for anyone!!
B0032CVAQQ|5.0|I love this book. It is so helpful and interesting. some may think you have to be married of have relationship problems to read this book, but you dont. It will prevent some problems that could form in the future. It has helped me understand my husbands needs along with my own and others.
B004SIP7AS|5.0|Quick service with ordering and shipping!<br />An entertaining version of this classic story/novel.<br />I had enjoyed this movie out of many which were made throughout the years.
0061438294|5.0|Joe Navarro brings a wealth of experience in the field of non-verbal communications.  He mentions and explains the obvious non-verbal signals to the non-obvious ones that go unnoticed by the untrained individual.  I enjoyed the story telling examples in which Joe uses these experiences to help the reader better understand how these non-verbal signals manifest themselves.  Highly recommend this book.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|This game is fun and challenges your brain. It can be enjoyed by all members of the family from young to old.
B007BVMVDU|5.0|I love to watch this in HD, because the scenery and everything else is so beautiful. Love the story, great mix of the mystical, knights, magic and history. Was hard to stop watching at 2 am.
B009M4KTEM|5.0|I love playing live Grateful Dead albums on long car trips, and I'll be happy to add this 1980 concert of Jerry Garcia and his band to my playlist.  It always strikes me that these guys take pleasure in playing and aim to communicate the pleasure of their music when they play.  They never get too high or too low, and their longer sets especially are so inventive and spontaneous-sounding that it lifts the spirits.  On this disc, with just a drummer a bassist and a keyboardist, the sound is less ample and the feel maybe a bit more jazzy than country-rock-blues-y, but there's still that delight in making the music alive and fresh, with not a hint of routine.  As a kind of bonus, Robert Hunter steps up and provides vocals on a couple of tracks (very nicely), and there are covers of a Beatles tune (\\"Dear Prudence\\") and a Dylan number (\\"Simple Twist of Fate\\" at 16+ minutes), both inventively played with.  Of more familiar material, there's a fine \\"Sugaree\\" to open the first disc (of three) and \\"Deal.\\"  I hadn't heard \\"Catfish John\\" before, but it's a nice ten minutes.  Then there's a haunting tune called \\"Mission in the Rain\\" -- very mellow and lovely.  I've seen attention focussed on Irving Berlin's \\"Russian Lullaby\\" -- a curiosity certainly, but I'm more attuned to \\"Catfish John.\\"  This 3-disc set is labeled Volume 1 -- I'm eager to see what comes next.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love playing thus game my kids live it too we sit around playing it as a family I would get bored with other fame's but thus one hasn't. Yet
B0064QNS62|5.0|This game actually pays homage to some seriously classic early computer based games. Among others, some of these are: Pharoah's Curse, Montezuma's Revenge, Donkey Kong, Boulder Dash and especially Miner 2049er. Look them up then you will realize that this is actually a five star game because it is a well thought out combination of all of these and more. It is a really good tip of the hat to those games, those early classic platformers that helped shape how we play video games today. What I don't see is a close comparison to Mario. it really isn't about that. I think that those comparing it to Mario simply don't know about the other games that I just mentioned, which is not a crime of course. But I highly recommend that you look them up as  they are all classics. My only issue with this game and it is extremely minor is that I wish the controls of this game were just a tiny bit better (I tested it on a 10 inch tegra2 tablet) but the game is still playable and has a learning curve similar to the games that I mentioned. However, I would love external controller support. But that is just wishful thinking on my part. So for that reason, and once that is all taken into account, I still have given it five stars.
B00C1BUYX4|2.0|Like everything with Spielberg's finger prints on it, this movie had great expecations.  In the end, the script was verbose, and the main plot line, limited to the passage of the 13th amendment, didn't strike me as weighty enough to carry a two and a half hour movie.  Day-Lewis performance was superb, but not enough so to make the movie worth watching.
B00BSBY38A|5.0|Loved this movie. Richard Parker was etched in my mind for weeks. Ending made you think about what the story really was.
B00A85EMVK|5.0|Who wouldn't love to see the best movie of all time in 3D?  Okay, maybe not the best of all time, but one of the greatest from its time period.  Wish it could have been even more enhanced but you still get the 3D feel.
B00BEZTMQ8|4.0|The movie is great but I am greatly disappointed that Warner Brothers had decided to forego iTunes downloads with this Blu-Ray+DVD+UV Combo Pack, thus the 4 star rather than 5.  I had hoped that there would be a code for iTunes too but I was sadly mistaken.  I suppose I have to store movies for two apps now.  So much for standards.
B00785P2QC|5.0|I just want my coins and this is the only way to get them.  Fun game good way to waste time in a lobby or at your kids practice.
B005VPRETE|5.0|Daughter loves these more piece sets and sits until she has one finished, even if it takes all day.<br />She loves following the directions herself.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|it is just fun to play around and pass time...wish the sides would stay up longer but other than that cool game
B007IK44CK|5.0|I really liked this.  Jeremy Renner is in it, too, and that was a two-fer.  Interesting gadgets and gizmos.  Another great M:I.  I am a TC fan...as an actor.  He never seems to disappoint.  Good entertainment and great locations.  Of course, the music always brings a modicum of excitement...like 007's theme.
B0070Y46UY|5.0|I have never read a survival story that intrigued me so much that I couldn't put it down! I knew that this book was fiction, but I couldn't help but think that it just might be real, for it was so well written and described. I highly recommend this book!!
B005HED11Y|5.0|Hard to believe this show is almost 50 years old, and still looks good.  What makes it great is the lack of technology available to the producers in the 60's.  They had to have good scripts and a good story to make it work, and they did.  You don't really have to have a brain to watch modern sci-fi, you just go along for the ride, but on the original Trek, you were there.  And the variety was good - comedy, adventure, science, and theology, all represented.  And these shows look great, literally.  The remastered color and imagery are far superior to what most of us saw on the originals, if you have a good HD TV.  One sad note, however: due to the dummies at NBC New York, the final year of production saw a decline in quality of scripts and topics, and on a few programs, the actors depression showed in their onscreen performance.  About half of the original cast are gone now, but to the rest, Thank You.
B00785P2QC|5.0|This app is great especially when you be able to have a whole city and when you can make money on additional trucks doing to same job and over night u can make 200,000 dollars
B009X01C64|4.0|no problems so far.  works well and seems to protect very well. a pocket or pouch for a few papers and a slot for stylus would also make it more user friendly but still a good purchase
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Sweet app. Can read bible anytime anywhere whenever I want. Love the diff versions. Love that I can make bookmarks of fave verses
B005K17RU0|5.0|This is a great app and I think I've tried most of them. Simple and to the point,everything I need and none of the B.S. I don't.

B006LSZECO|4.0|I must admit I did not quite like the way it was written for the first few pages , but then it picked up later and I actually began liking her style of writing. There are a few instances in the book where I was wondering - how much more crazy can it get! And was stunned by the convoluted ideas and actions of the main character. Overall a very different book , but I just felt the ending could have been better.
B009YP9L7U|1.0|Not what I thought....not for this reader....if you don't mind expletives then go for it....I deleted this book from my e reader....Glad it was free.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this game is so fun. where can you find a game with so many mini games in it.love it. I can play for hours. get this game.
0375869026|5.0|Wonder is a book just full of good stuff!  It's a book about courage, friendship, love and generosity.  When I finished  reading Wonder, I marveled at the kindness we humans are capable of showing.  Bookwoman
B0065CCM76|5.0|You just have a hard time beating Bob Seger. I so enjoy listening to him and the band. The songs on the Album are great and very enjoyable to listen to.
B00BP4Z8XY|5.0|A great way to enjoy a quite evening with the family, for the young, teen, and adult a very well rounded and nicely executed movie.  It has witty humor, childish pranks and some very sad and profound moments.  A great movie, I highly recommend it.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|When I first downloaded this game I was just sucking at it but how I am becoming a frickin master at this on the first 2 I played I kept beating my highscore sometimes and I wouldn't exit the app I couldn't help myself!! KEEP UP THE GOOD WORK KILOO
B0052RDHTM|5.0|Ken Follett is a raconteur par excellence, but he's more than that.  With sweeping brush strokes of plot, strong characters, and history, he paints is a masterpiece of the world as it was and what remained after the scourge of World War I.  This epic drama waltzes you through the elegant country life of the rich, the hovels and hard scrapple coal mines of the poor, the rat infested trenches of the Somme, and the blood drenched streets of the Russian Revolution.  Ken Follet takes you there.  You'll both feel and grasp the cataclysmic storms that swept through Europe at the start of the 20th Century.  Read this book for the racing plot and riveting personalities.  Read it for a glimpse into history.  Read it for the human face that emerges.
B009FZFONO|5.0|I have been waiting a long time for a Zombie Show with the excellent quality production as The Walking Dead.<br />I'd like to give it 6 starts, but 5 is the maximum.
B000O8OTNC|5.0|This thing sharpens just about anything and it works pretty damn well. When I was buying this I knew it was not for big knives but for smaller pocket knives. I mainly use it on my leatherman, and it works pretty damn awesome. I use my leatherman almost every day and the knife has to be sharp... This thing does the job VERY WELL ...<br /><br />It is not for bigger knives, I ll tell you that much, and it sharpens shallow. But smaller and thinner knives, works awesome.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I absolutely love this game to the fullest. I wonder what temple run 3 will have to offer. #cantwait pronto
B00BR4QNJ0|5.0|much better then old game not as many glitches fun game play and awesome grafics. I say that anyone should download this game.
B0091V6TF4|5.0|Great songs from great singers. If you enjoy now or have enjoyed &#34;007&#34; movies over the years then this CD is for you. Makes a great gift for the 'bond movie lover in your family or friends))
B0042GIRYE|5.0|great music, entertaining, great traditional sound mixed in with modern country rock. great music for a road trip. you will enjoy.
B00B7FWWNA|4.0|Sweet movie, Helen Hunt is fabulous of course. Beautifully written. would recommend for a nice evening in, won't blow your mind though.
B00BJS7LHC|5.0|Believe it or not, this was my first Quentin Tarantino movie...and I LOVED IT! Django Unchained is an epic &#34;underdog&#34; story about a slave who seeks his revenge in the long run. I don't want to spoil anything, so I'll stop there.<br /><br />Jamie Foxx did an incredible job as Django, and Christoph Waltz deservedly won an Oscar for &#34;Best Supporting Actor&#34; for his role as Dr. Schultz. As much as I loved Django's character, Dr. Schultz was even more fascinating.<br /><br />Every actor did an amazing job, as the story and action scenes were spot on. Pacing was near perfect, the soundtrack fits the time period and theme perfectly, and I now have to go back and watch more Tarantino movies. On to Pulp Fiction...
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is Awesomeness my friends all love it!  I love how they constantly update it so you can keep unlocking characters and hover board's I would definitely recommend those game to a friend
B004E9T0HW|4.0|i liked the book. the second part of the trilogy (although its not really a trilogy) isnt that great but i liked this one. It has as its base, the solid relationship between the two main charactedrs (who are husband and wife), which is very attractive. anyone who has had a long and happy marriage can really relate to it and i think thats what i liked the most about it, apart from the story line.
B00BJ9VBLI|5.0|i love this game cause it sometimes gets harder each leavl i go. but i stops at leavl 14 and have to buy the game.
B009IEXKXI|5.0|wonderful book, a bit old style but with its own charm. The trials and tribulations of the astronaut are very well narrated and it stays within the bounds or possibility.
B00280LYHS|5.0|This was so much fun reading this book. I truly loved this book. It was so funny and the last Olympian why should I spoil the book.
B00BHHIWQO|3.0|I really enjoyed this game however it is hard to play continuously due to having to have lived wish there was a way to have a game play every they search for opponents, overall the game is addicting and fun I guess my only complaint is I wish it would last longer!!!
B007SGLZP8|4.0|I still love John Grisham.  I still love the way he develops his characters and how he develops the plot of his stories.  If you are a fan, you will like this one as well.
B004T4KQJS|5.0|Professor Krauss has done the impossible, he has made the universe understandable to me. Modern theories sound more Zen than science but he put a human face to it. He stretched my mind. I will reread this many times over the next few years or until something better comes along.<br /><br />[[ASIN:B007WFZR3Q Out of the Cradle]]
1400079144|3.0|Not as good as The DaVince Code and Angels and Deamons. It seems to wonder about and the science of Noetics isnt made clear. Seemed just a little too far-fetched. I'm a voracious reader and I usually dont put a book down until I'm done, but I walked away from this one several times and came back later.
B00395ZYVS|5.0|Although not exactly the same circumstances, I can relate to some of the subplots that she wrote.  Very well written.  I did get a little of all the Indian words but I could look them up easily since I read it on Kindle.
0345529057|5.0|So far, I'm only up to book #3, and I cant put them down. Thank God I'm retired and can spend all week reading! There are so many twists and turns, ins and outs, it takes all your concentration. For serious Sci-Fi/Fantasy readers only!
B0066W1AZK|5.0|There are three different levels to this game. I am getting off easy now. Just so much fun and a great way to pass the time and relax. Would recommend.
0786956291|4.0|We bought this boxed set of the Dungeons and Dragons 4th Edition starter set for a specific reason: To introduce our children (and reintroduce ourselves) to D&D.<br /><br />My husband and I haven't played any tabletop RPGs since we stopped playing D&D 2e when we were teenagers. We recently decided we wanted to get back into playing the games, and also to introduce our children to gaming as well. After a bit of research, we bought all 3 core rulebooks from 3.0e because that was what seemed to fit best with how we wanted to play. We also bought a few rulebooks from other rpg systems to play around with.<br /><br />But what we really wanted was a simple way to introduce the concept to our children without having to go into great depth and losing them with too much info all at once. This set is perfect for that.<br /><br />It isn't the same rules that you'll end up using if you get the core rulebooks and make full characters from scratch. It is a very simplified version of the rules that will show you how stats work, and ease you into learning about roleplaying.<br /><br />We have only played through the first 'solo adventure' so far. It's basically a Choose Your Own Adventure that dumbs everything down, assuming that you have zero idea of what you're doing. It doesn't allow for rolling for stats, it gives you a basic set of numbers with modifiers for certain races and classes. I don't know if this is exclusive to this set, or if this is how D&D 4e works, but I certainly hope it's just this set.<br /><br />The adventure is actually pretty confusing, so I wouldn't just hand it to someone and tell them to have at it. Even when you 'choose option a and go to section 25' as instructed, you will inevitably skip over parts (like how many HP your character gets)that are integral to character creation. You'll be confused until you figure out that because you didn't take damage in your first combat encounter, you accidentally skipped the part where it explained how many Hit Points you are allocated.<br /><br />I don't see this as being a complete boxed set that will get you started in D&D. I see this as more of a starter set that will introduce complete newbies to the concept of pen and paper gaming. If that's what you're looking for and you can get this for a good price, I say go for it. It is inexpensive and it will ease you into gaming in a way that can make it easier for some people to understand.<br /><br />This item does have a few glaring flaws, such as the solo adventure being confusing to follow. The writers seem to be aware of them without having fixed them, they tell you at the end of the adventure to 'go back and fill in what you missed'. For that, it loses points.<br /><br />It does have some neat items that allow you to get a feel for the game, such as a dungeon map and little cardboard tokens to use as characters and monsters. They aren't high quality, but they will introduce you to the concepts.<br /><br />If you prefer something that doesn't cater to small children, I would go ahead and buy a used set of the core rulebooks from an earlier edition such as 3.0. You can buy a full set of 3 for under $20 on Amazon, so it isn't a huge investment to start. A lot of people still play with these rules, so you are bound to find some people to play with.<br /><br />If you are aware of exactly what this item is and what it can do, it can be a good buy for you. But don't think that it's something it isn't, and it isn't a full introduction to Dungeons and Dragons.
B00138H876|5.0|Classic Dylan. I Don't remember when this was recorded, but I think it was the 70's. Knowing that, his voice is clearer, his songs truer, than today. Yes it sounds scratchy but it was recorded on vinyl, and that being the case the listener is getting Dylan in his true form, his original sound that made hm so popular then and now. If you want remastered. Then more power to you, but l'll stick with the original all day long.
B0060MYM7O|5.0|Had to open it immediately on arrival, check out all of the pictures, and designs on the DVD case before start watching it.  It was interesting/different that the &#34;Digital Copy&#34; comes on two disks for your computer.
1451695195|2.0|There was not much story about the experience. I had expected more from his television interviews. He does not give a vivid recount but rather hurries through that part of his life.
B007QDNKQA|5.0|I really enjoyed this film.  Great actors, probably happened in our government.  They need a sequel to this movie because it's that good.
B00BFUUMO8|5.0|Awesome game if you like dinosaurs and building your own theme park games you also can do sea creatures of that time period as well after level ten
B0000C0F8W|4.0|Great quality vinyl, securely shipped, and sounds wonderful. A fantastic addition to my growing vinyl collection that I listen to on at least a couple of times  a week. Adds a real depth of sound to an already wonderful album.

B004UPAN6W|5.0|This is an awesome movie. If someone really has to read the reviews here, then they may just want to find another movie because any &#34;true believer&#34; Marvel fans would already know this is an incredible comic to movie take on Wolverine.

B003CBTVNG|4.0|Molly Shannon............great for when you need to watch something utterly ridiculous.  If this doesn't make you laugh you either had a charmed childhood or your funny bone is broken.
B008CJ0KEM|5.0|Lost girl is a fun and sexy show for Sci-Fi fans.  I have loved watching the show since I picked it up mid season 1, and I bought the Blu Ray to catch episodes I missed and to get my friends hooked on it as well
B00BGIBVP8|1.0|This is the very first movie I have rented using my amazon prime account.  It was horrible to watch and eventually my boyfriend and i gave up and turned it off.  It timed out about 3 times the 4th for over 5 minutes and we shut it off.

B00BWJ7LYG|3.0|Was a good movie, a bit cheesier than the LOTR films,  diverged from the book quite a bit at points.
B004UPANGM|2.0|This must have been a blast to make. Bruce Campbell sure looks like he's having fun here.  I'm sure glad the special effects have improved since the 80's.
B000FC1JCQ|5.0|This is the second time I have read this book.  I love the mental pictures that form while getting burried in the story.
B00BLCHYKU|5.0|vikings without the fabricated helmet with horns....gotta love it<br />will watch it religiously for the coming weeks<br />3 more words required
B006BGZJJ4|5.0|I purchased this as a replacement for the cable that was left out of my original purchase.  It works great.  I did not purchase my kindle from Amazon, so they could not send me the cable that was left out.
B001TW68P4|5.0|They were a quite underrated group of the the '60'.  They produced some wonderful tunes and were mostly overshadowed by the British Invasion.  Lots of amazing American bands were, but , it you're a fan, you will love this!
B000N2HBSO|4.0|Made the movie a disappointment. The book made you intemently involved with the characters. Most of them were not heavily handled in the movie
B0041X90D0|5.0|This was my intruduction to Bolan.  The first time I heard &#34;Baby Strange&#34; - well, let's just say that if you were a very repressed 15 to 16 year old suburban girl living on the outskirts of New Olreans, there is no better explanation.  He had it all.  Sadly, taken too soon.  I can only thank God above that I never got within touching distance.
B009A9EPLM|5.0|Made your movie more interesting. there is no better composer than John Williasms<br />He is brillliant in wverything he does.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|This game is lots of fun. I loved doing the challenges. I love that it changes locations of the subway. The graphics on the Kindle Fire for this game is awesome.
B001ANSS5K|4.0|Really liked this story. Not as moving as the faults in our stars but still a good read! Also if you liked the perks of being a wallflower you will like this book.
B0040I09RM|5.0|I LOVE THIS SHOW AND RECOMMEND IT TO ANYONE...JAX AND THE GUYS ARE GREAT AND KEEP YOU ON YOUR TOES...
B007TNS6JI|4.0|very good for a free app. the developers did a great job at making an rpg. especially for kindle fire and all
B006MW3V6U|5.0|The show is very well done. Great acting. It feels like the story keeps moving along without warring the viewers time.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|I really enjoyed this book and have recommended to several others.  Would make a good choice for a book club!  It kept me guessing on the 'who-done-it' until the very end.  A very good read.
B00ABKGG0C|5.0|Amazing book! I have read many fantasy books in my time , but this has been one of the best I have ever read! I hope the second one comes out soon.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|American Sniper gives you an insight not only on Chris's life but also some things he went through being a SEAL. Just from how he writes you can tell he is southern Texas man! This book is easy to read and I'm delaying reading the last 25% just because I don't want to finish it, I like it to much.
