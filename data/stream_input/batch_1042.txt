B0026P3G12|5.0|Susan Boyle's CD, 'I Dreamed a Dream' is great.  Playing it in the car a lot.  The song selection is outstanding.  Would highly recommend it.
0143034901|4.0|So I had to read this for bookclub. I almost vomitted at having to read a well rated, modern, new-ish author. Especially a translated book at that. Having read the disaster than was \\"The Alchemist\\" (also translated from Spanish) I was a little worried that this book might fall to the same fate of being a bit of kindly to add to the fire on a cold winter's evening. Amazingly that was not the case at all. From the moment I began reading, the language and story-telling expertise that Zafon (and the translator) have managed to put down on paper is intriguing, compelling and irresistible. You will feel as though you are running around Barcelona exploring a Gaudi inspired labyrinth of alcoves and cobbled backstreets. Unfortunately for me, the main character becomes less interesting as they struggle to evolve throughout the story despite aging considerably, however luckily another character is introduced that is much more interesting and gets you over the line. The last 200 pages will be read in a whirlwind blur as you are sucked in to see how everything pans out. Highly recommended.
B00006LFGD|5.0|The Duets CD is awesome. It gives you a 'through the years' look at what Barbra has accomplished with other talented names. I was blown away at how much I have enjoyed this CD.
B000268QB2|4.0|Just really good music. I love it. I find myself going back to this music again and again, great mix of sound, love the piano, really good.
B002B0NAV8|5.0|First heard the song ROOT in 95 at a friends house and was blown away. I went from bush and nirvana to something far greater and mind opening. (The tool aenima psychedelic experience came at the same time haha)   Around the Fur and Adrenaline still take me back to the day. I still put in those albums and they take me back to those summer's of living life and having new experiences to the sounds of deftones. I still put in these albums on a summer day and it brings a smile. I wish I could go back to those days,the style of music. Hacky sacks and hemp, skateboarding before and after school, Riding my bike across town to sneak into girls houses and run out the back door when their parents got home. Sneaking out at night to go on rodie's and parties. What a life. I miss it!!!     Any of you out there around 25 yrs old that remember the good ol days??? Please reply with comment.     Adrenaline and Around the Fur and White Pony are my fav. along with tool's aenima and lateralus   Anyhow White pony is amazing. Had plenty of good memories with that album driving summer nights, drinking partying. Self titled is good but not as good as previous 3. I still had good times. I am hardcore fan but still won't buy Saturday Night Wrist. I only like a few songs. Very rushed album!! I don't think Chino was in the right mindset for that album nor was the rest of the band. Trust me im hardcore fan but that album just isn't the same...Diamond Eyes is a ton better than Saturday Night Wrist. Diamond Eyes has those few moments where I feel like im in the around the fur days. Also those douchebags that think deftones are nu-metal (which they aren't) don't have any musical talent to not atleast say deftones are a talented unique distinct sounding band. No one and i mean no one sounds like them. Not like todays metal music where half the bands sound like Killswitch Engage had babies. Sorry, had to get that in there, those nu-metal people piss me off. The greatest bands of all time are the hardest to define in a genre.     I know this review was more about memories rather than detailed review. But I just was thinking today how I wish I could go back and relive the mid and late 90's all over again. Take me to 98 please.
0312600844|2.0|How is the world can anyone consider this to be a high quality novel? Here is a great passage: \\"As she humped his bare leg through her under-pants, grunting a little with every thrust, he felt himself flying centrifugally, a satellite breaking free of gravity, mentally farther and farther away from the woman whose tongue was in his mouth and whose gratifyingly nontrivial tits were smashed into his chest. She fooled around more brutally,less pliantly, than Connie did- that was part of it. But he also couldn't see her face in the dark, and when he couldn't see it he had only the memory, the idea of its beauty. He kept telling himself that he was finally getting Jenna Jenna Jenna. But in the absence of visual confirmation all he had in his arms was a random sweating attacking female.\\" What a bunch of slop! The author's treatment of women throughout the book is demeaning.
0345505387|5.0|As a huge fan of Gabaldon's and someone who would probably read her tax return every year and still be enthralled simply because she wrote it, I gotta say that I truly loved this book. Yes, some of the panels are a bit hastily drawn, but the ones that are good, are DAMN GOOD! My favorite was the wedding kiss drawing...::sigh::.    I also enjoyed the added story line with Kenneth and seeing just how much Murtagh may know about what Claire really is. Also, we get another little peek into Geillis Duncan's conniving ways...    I know some of you didn't like this book, and you're entitled to your opinion. But I don't see how you can be upset that it is essentially a comic book when the term \\"GRAPHIC NOVEL\\" is in the title.    All in all, if you're a fan of the writer, and have the Lord John books, too, you MUST ADD THIS TO YOUR COLLECTION!!!
044656740X|4.0|Great read. Not very helpful other than to provide motivation for taking control of your financial situation. Make sure you research everything before you just jump into a financial situation.
B00003CXB4|4.0|Recieved this video as ordered but I was disappointed at the score. The title song was no longer by Elton John. This was a great disappoint! Otherwise the disk was in excellent condition.
B003XQRZ7E|4.0|This is unquestionably one of the best rock releases of the year.  Most of all, it's really consistent and has a real live feel throughout.  Sound quality is excellent (not as squashed in the mastering phase as are many new releases).  Songwriting is very good, and there seems to be a real rapport between Glenn Hughes and Joe Bonamassa.  I come to the album as a fan of Glenn Hughes, but like others here I prefer when he eases of the gas a little and screams less.  There are a couple of songs where it is a bit much, which explains the 4-star rather than 5-star review.  But then there are other tunes, like the barn-burning \\"Black Country\\" track, where Hughes' aggressive approach works well.  Overall, I put this up with \\"Music For the Divine\\" and \\"Building the Machine\\" and the first HTP as one of Hughes' best projects post-recovery.
B003DZX44I|5.0|I love this movie too and would like to buy this. However, I can't tell from the product description if I can play the 3 versions of the film on a DVD player? Any ideas?

B002RWKSII|5.0|Gershwin is wonderful, and Brian Wilson is wonderful.  What a combination!  It's another vehicle to display their musical talents.  I couldn't be happier that Brian decided to do this tribute to the great George Gershwin.  Thank you Brian and everyone who worked on this CD.
B0021L8V1G|4.0|MAYBE a SPOILER here or there...Lets make this quick..Too much witty talk ...In the comics HAMMER is a power to be feared. Here, He's a bumbling fool. This was not a good write for this charactor. Let's move on Stark's part was great. Black widow good ..Whiplash's part fine but not much screen time...Happy Hogan good...THE problem with this film is ...WHERE's IRON MAN?? For cryin' out loud enough with the goofy comedy and start kickin some you know what! Finally towards the end I was ok Let's get it on....sure after WAR MACHINE and IRON MAN fly around the STARK EXPO a thousand times...a few explosions here and there... 20 minutes later ...oh wow a fight scene!!! a real bang um' up fight scene OK let's go finally yeah...shooting repulsor's that's cool ...WAR MACHINE with all the weapons mounted on his armor that's great yeah....shoot shoot thats great Then I thought wow! Big final brawl! WEll! not really... Because Us IRON MAN fan's all know that IRON MAN isn't just shoot repulsor's guy over and over and over...His ARMOR also gives him SUPER HUMAN STRENGTH!!! ..That's what I wanted to see in this movie BUT! No cars thrown around ...NO boulders Thrown around NO saving people from a out of control bus or whatever.. etc...THis movie could have at least put scenes like that in. We fans like BIG SCRAPPING METAL ON METAL 10 minute throw downs!!!...but no... The court room talks when STARK was ranting on how He is THE Super Hero of the people they could have shown you know IRON MAN flying in saving people from a plane crash or lifting a bus off someone whatever...BUT NO In the comics IRON MAN can LIFT up to 100 tons. In these movies you would never know it!!! it's just fly,fly,shoot fly fly shoot etc...end...............The movie was good overall but Come on next time BRING SOME IRON A** kickin'!!

B0033PSH4U|4.0|Of course, I have seen 'A Bronx Tale' several times on television, which is why I purchased it.  So, I undoubtingly, love the movie!  Which is why I was excited about the opportunity of purchasing same.  The quality is really good.  Yet, advising it as 'Exclusive' is a bit much; especially one with no 'Subtitle'.  How can an 'Exclusive' be a copy?  Too expensive to be a copy!  Feel jacked![[ASIN:B0033PSH4U A Bronx Tale (Amazon.com Exclusive)]]
0671449028|4.0|I was looking for age appropriate and preferably rhyming books to read with my 2 1/2 year old boy-girl twins who didn't understand that bedtime means going to bed and SLEEP! I thought of trying my luck on Amazon to see what I could find that fits the bill. A click here and there brought me to Sandra Boynton's collection of funny rhyming books. After reading raving reviews for most of her books, I decided to start with The Going To Bed Book and [[ASIN:B003LNZ0GW Night-Night, Little Pookie]], which are both about going to bed. I must say I am not disappointed. ( soon after I went out to get more Boynton books to add to the collection! )    The first page of the book featured all the animal characters that are the regulars in the Boynton series. A hippo, a pig, a moose, a dog, an elephant, a hare, a cat, a rhino, a lion and.... Little Pookie! Like any other toddlers, my twins are at the stage where they find all animals super adorable and funny. So they were naturally hooked on the book from page one. The book goes on to show the animals  going down the stairs where Little Pookie is seen hiding under the stairs with his rounded eyes rolled to a corner, as if expecting to be found or even better, not being found so he could jump out and say \\" Boo! \\" to scare his friends. The next pages show the animals scrub, scrub, scrubbing away in a Biggggg tub filled with foam with an over sized toothbrush, hanging their towels, finding pajamas, brushing their teeth  and up again to exercise before going down to bed at last.    Each page has a one-liner sentence or two. The choice of words is simple, age appropriate and rhymes like ago/below/tub/scrub/wall/small/beneath/teeth/rise/exercise/fast/last...you get the gist. The background of each page is in pale pastel colors of pink, blue, yellow and green. Soothing for sleepy eyes. The humor of the story lies in the animals facial expressions and some of their actions, such as the dog who put on his pajama too small looking at the haretrying to stand up in a pair of pants too big :)    Did my twins finally understand the meaning of bedtime after having read the book with me ninety eight times and more to come? No. But the book has definitely become a routine read before I go to sleep each night ( they soon follow normally)    Recommended.     Age 1- 6
B002G1YPH0|5.0|Installing this system was more of a challenge than planned.  Included directions are useless, more than useless, so I did form fit before screwing anything together.  At one point I set it aside and began packing it for return to Amazon.  A short break and finally, after about an hour, managed to make it work.  So far it's done well in keeping the CPU (AMD 555) operating around 94F, without overclocking.  Being able to set CPU fan speed thresholds through Asus and AMD software can reduce the temp much more.  Standard is about 200RPM.  I bumped it to 250 just for safety reasons of my own.<br />Caution, install memory first; this is larger than it looks, depending on your board, it might block access to RAM install.<br />Other cautions: Handle motherboard with ESD procedures, be careful and work slowly.  The board becomes a bit off balance and easily dropped.<br />This works nice, I'm happy to have it working.  I'm still tweaking the fan and adjusting fan for some rattle/buzzing, but it's not enough to annoy, but loud enough to be aware it's happening.  Be prepared for lousy instructions, and some backward ideas in setting this up, though you'll be happy once it's installed and working.
0385342047|2.0|In this newest book Becky Bloomwood has a two-year-old daughter who Luke worries is out of control, so much so that he wants to call the equivalent of a Super Nanny; a part-time job as a personal shopper to feed her clothing addiction; and as much of a spending addiction as she ever did -- worse, in fact, because now she can say she's buying for Minnie.  Add a global recession and her determination to throw the biggest most lavish party she can, and you've got a typical Bloomwood scenario, with the potential to go enormously wrong.  Sophie Kinsella manages to keep it funny, with some lovely poignant moments, and she still manages to work in some surprises, but what was humorous and charming in book one is becoming a little stale.  And where readers could sympathize with the early Becky, it's hard to feel for someone who spends too much when she has a wealthy husband.  Not to mention that at this point the reader has to wonder:  Is she ever going to learn?    So, in short, still enjoyable -- but I'd love to see something new!
0385474547|1.0|The higher the expectation, the more bitter the disappointment can be.  This book proves it.  Supposedly, \\"Things Fall Apart\\" is one of the three or four classic, must-read books of African literature.  If this is a classic, I don't want to see the B-list.  Minimal character development; no explanation for bizarre, cruel, impulsive behavior of the protagonist or others.  I had no idea what made these characters tick.  And so the story didn't grab me because I didn't have empathy or understanding for or of the people who were in it.  The title is great; unfortunately, \\"things fell apart\\" after I opened the book.  STEVE MEISTER
0374158460|1.0|If I didnt know better I would have thought this book ws written by David Rockafeller.  Its all about making you feel guilty for being alive.  It figures that this would be an Oprah pick.  She is a dangerous woman.  Do yourself a favor and buy \\"End The Fed\\" by Ron Paul.
B002ZG983M|5.0|I expected this to be like \\"what if seth rogen made a superhero movie?\\" But it was more like \\"what if Quentin Tarantino made a superhero movie?\\" It was filled with comedy, drama, and ACTION! The characters were awesome and it doesn't hold back. Funny thing is that Kick#ss is the least likable superhero of this movie, in my opinion. Hit-girl could have her own movie!Way better than that piece of garbage Watchmen...
0553584537|3.0|Police sniper Bobby Dodge is called to a domestic disturbance, where he sees a man brandishing a gun at a frightened woman and child with a gun. It ends badly, with Dodge compelled to shoot him for the threat he poses. Dodge knows he'll have to deal with the emotional consequences of killing someone, but he's knocked for a loop when he learns that the man's father, a corrupt, power mongering judge who wants Bobby charged with murder. Against his better judgment, Bobby responds when the new widow contacts him with a request for help, because the judge is going after custody of the little boy. This one dramatic night unleashes a trail of violence in which no one is certain who the bad guys are.<br /><br />This is a fairly strong plotline, strong enough to carry the reader through to the end, but it's undermined by its characters, which are two dimensional and unoriginal. There's the cop who went into crime prevention because of his unhappy childhood, and can't sustain a relationship. He's assigned to see the police therapist, a wise, kindly woman who can fix him up in less than two months.  The widow is a psychologically damaged victim of kidnapping and sex abuse, who now has difficulty with the simplest tasks of mothering, but with her stunning beauty can seduce any man.  The antagonists are an unscrupulous judge, a spoiled rich kid, and a sex offender. There are a few interesting surprises toward the end, however, and, to the author's credit, not all the loose ends are neatly tied together.
B001QERPDO|4.0|music on cd is wonderful. Was very disappointed when it arrived with a big crack in the case, though. Other than that, can't complain.
0385342047|2.0|I have read all the previous Shopaholic books and liked them. Laughed out loud funny at times, the characters are predictable, and endearing, and I like that. BUT, this newest book gets only 2 stars. It delivered what I was expecting, and not looking for a highly intelligent novel I got exactly what I wanted, a fun read, with a little humor, and some touching moments... The problem is that now Becky is a mother and her attitude toward shopping and the other people in her life don't mesh quite so well with the picture of a caring, loving, thoughtful mother. I think there is a fine line being walked between liking Becky as a mother and thinking she's completely clueless as to raising a child. It's cute and funny when it's just her and the other adults, not as funny when a child is involved. It's just not that cute to see a child be that spoiled and crazy. Lastly, why in the world is there so much cursing in this book? I just don't remember that in the other books. An occasional well-placed curse word to emphasize a point is fine, but every other page has the F word on it. And, again, the characters are often cursing in front of the child... just kind of makes them seem trashy, and made me cringe.

0345505387|2.0|I did know that I was purchasing a graphic novel, and I was still hugely disappointed.  I was expecting to learn more about Jamie as a character, but it seems that everyone is rushing around pretty thoughtlessly (perhaps as a consequence of the picture-driven format, there is hardly any thoughtful conversation, let alone thoughtfulness).  To me, what was magical about the Outlander books is the conversations so perhaps I am not the best person to judge a graphic novel.  Objectively, though, I do believe that if this book is going to retell the Outlander story, it ought to at least get that story correct.  But at several points in this book--two that I noticed right away are the walk to the church for the wedding and when Jamie takes Claire back to the standing stones--the story is just plain not the same story as it was in the original.  Retell the story, if you must, but please do not make it a different story.  I am giving this book two stars instead of one because the pictures are lovely.

0786955570|5.0|After reading many positive comments about this game and watching the \\"unboxing\\" video on the WotC web site [...] I decided that this would be the perfect introduction to DnD for my daughters (ages 11 and 12).  The general consensus that I got from reading up on the game was that it plays very much like DnD 4th Edition with the role of the GM played by the careful, but brief rule system.  The box contains a rule booklet (available as a PDF download from the game site), and an adventure booklet that contains several 1-page adventures, each of which customizes the rules of the game towards a specific scenario.  Additionally, WotC provides a couple of supplemental adventures as downloads from the Castle Ravenloft site.    the only drawback to the game is that it requires a LOT of table space.  Depending on the adventure you choose, and the direction that your players choose to explore throughout the randomly generated dungeon, you can quickly create a large, unwieldy dungeon that stretches to the very edges of your table surface (and beyond).  This leads to making decisions about which directions to move based not on where you want to go, but where there is room on your table to expand.    In addition to the ever growing dungeon, each player also has to deal with the many cards required to play.  Every player gets a \\"hero card\\" which is a heavy stock cardboard card that measures about 6x6 and features the essential stats for their chosen hero (cleric, rogue, ranger, fighter, or mage).  Each player also gets 5-6 power cards that describe their at-will, utility, and daily powers.  As players defeat monsters they acquire treasure cards, and as the game progresses they may acquire any number of monster or encounter cards.  There are also 40 plastic figurines for monsters and players, and decks for treasure, encounters, and monsters that must be accessible to all players.  With a game featuring 3 or more players, things can quickly devolve into a chaotic mess if you're notcareful.  In our second game, which featured a villain that could cause the dungeon to randomly expand) we were forced to move the dungeon and our cards several times to make room for the expansions and keep track of the monsters that were spawning on every turn.    Despite the apparent complexity with so many game items to keep track of, both of my daughters were able to quickly pick up the basics of the d20 system and, by the mid point of our second game, were quickly and easily calculating the necessary rolls with specific attack bonuses to hit the armor class of the monsters that they had targeted.  It made this father very proud to hear my 11-year-old say: \\"OK, so my tide of iron has a +8 to attack, and that skeleton has an armor class of 16.  But I'm on the same tile as the level 2 mage, so I get a +1 bonus to my attack roll.  I need to roll a 7 or higher to hit him.\\"   As an educational tool it definitely teaches kids to quickly do simple mental arithmetic, and keep track of lots of variables (treasure, traps, encounters, hit points, and bonuses).      Overall, it's a fantastic game that's fun for everyone, and is a great on-ramp to more open ended DnD sets in the future.  I'm very satisfied!

B002RKSZKI|5.0|Emma Woodhouse is priviledged.  Very priviledged.  She comes from the richest, most important family in her small town.  Everyone looks up to her, including her indulgent governess and even more indulgent papa.  The theme of her life, from the time she was small, has always been \\"Emma knows best\\".   Emma takes this to heart when she takes an interest in young Harriet Smith, the beautiful, empty-headed daughter of, well, someone.  The book follows Emma's misadventures as she tries to marry Harriet off to the local parson and meddles in the lives of her friends and neighbors, eventually learning that perhaps she doesn't always know best.      This is, I think, one of Jane Austen's less popular works, perhaps because there isn't a great deal of romance in it.  It is, as I titled the review, more of a character study, as well as a study of society at that time.  On first reading, I didn't care for the book or for Emma's self-centered goodness.  After reading it again, I grew to enjoy the book as much if not more than her more popular works, like Pride and Prejudice.  The wit is sharp as usual (and maybe slightly more ascerbic), and more thought seems to have been put into the secondary characters.  Definitely worth a read.
B001FB0WBK|5.0|Tommy Emmanuel is one of the best artists I have ever seen play a guitar. I tried to see him in concert, but he was sold out. This DVD is the next best thing. Turn around the surround sound, turn down the lights and experience the magic.
B0009X7664|5.0|I was 8 years old when \\"To Kill A Mockingbird\\" was 1st published, and each year, for my birthday, I reread the book. My gift to myself, this year, was to actually OWN the movie, rather than wait for it to end up on TV, which I haven't seen in years. Now, I can read the book each year, followed up by the on-screen antics of Scout, Jem, Atticus and ultimately, Boo. LOVED the extra features, which is why I bought this version...to see the actors beyond the characters.
B0000AC8LR|4.0|Even after watching this movie twice, you'll still wonder what it's really about.<br /><br />But even given this frustration, there is so much that is good about this movie that a little bit of incomprehensibility can be forgiven.<br /><br />Donnie Darko, the character, is, undoubtedly, a very special young man.  But he's also a troubled young man, and in this respect, he's actually *not* special.  The nature of his unhappiness with the world in general is probably what most adolescents go through.  Donnie's actions, however, are not ordinary in the least.<br /><br />The question is, what is it that ultimately motivates Donnie?  Is he just schizophrenic, or is something deeper going on?  Is Donnie just a suburban hoodlum, or is he a hero, or is he a pawn?<br /><br />It's a good story, extremely well acted, directed and shot.
B003TML0VO|4.0|With the thought of another collaboration album coming from Santana, I was ready to dismiss it to dead horse territory but this is a pleasant and fun surprise. I've followed this music for decades and can tell you  I can make a solid objective opinion unlike say the first uninformed review.    Guitar Heaven has to be put in perspective of the 2000's and the series of records Carlos has made closely with Clive Davis who brought the emphasis on feature vocalists. I think after \\"Shaman\\" this idea was taken too far with the stale retread \\"All That I Am\\".     Fearing for the worst when I saw some of the pre-publicity, after now hearing it in entirety, I know this was a good move. This record is just fun! It can be debated that this or that is not exactly right, but this is the first time in decades you have heard Carlos solo like this. There are a ton of new little morsels intertwined in his playing. There is a lot going on here in production and it's very well balanced.    The songs.  \\"Back in Black\\", \\"Whole Lotta Love\\", \\"Can't You Hear Me knock'n\\",  \\"I Ain't Superstitious\\", these four alone are worth the ten bucks. Personally, this is a fun and welcome change from the message songs,   but I do think that the collaboration thing is now officially worn out.

0307454541|5.0|I realize there is no relation, but I haven't read a series of books like the Millenium Trilogy in, like, forever. Granted, the third book doesn't have enough Lisbeth, but, the tension and excitement makes up for it. I only wish I was Swedish so I could have read it in original form, and so I could keep track of the names and places a little better.<br />Seriously, these books have not been on the top of the bestseller lists forever for nothing. Such a tragedy that we will never again get more from this incredible author.

0345505387|5.0|Many of the negative comments are because people thought they were buying another novel, but the title says The Exile An Outlandish Graphic Novel. So you thought you were buying a book not a graphic novel? I don't understand you people.     Anyway, the comic book is great, I learned more about Jamie and Murtagh, and you even get a sub plot that is not in the original Outlander. Very Exciting. I also liked the illustrations, it's Jamie and Claire in a graphic novel form, they conform to the genre. They look fantastic, I love their cartoon forms. I'm not sure if people who don't read comic books will realize that this is not an illustrated Outlander, it's a comic book, different expression of the story. Like a movie is different than a book which is different than a comic book. As for the rest of us who either like comic books or just like Jamie and Claire, in any form, we love it!!!
0345505387|3.0|As a diehard fan of Diana Gabaldon, and also being a fan of the comic book and graphic novels industry (ElfQuest is my other obsession) I was really looking forward to this book.  I enjoyed the new twists on the storyline, such as the odd introduction of Kenneth, that was interesting- if pointless, due to death in the end.  However, the art; while gorgeous; was just not consistent enough.  I like Hoang's work, but his ability to keep redrawing the same face really needs some practice.  For instance, Jamie's face and hair were completely different at the end of the book, when he and Claire were at Craigh na Dun, than they were when he was introduced with the nice sharp face.  By the end, he'd lost the slanted eyes, lost the stubborn chin, lost the swoopy hair, lost the long nose, his hair had lightened by 3 shades and his eyes as well. He'd gained a much skinnier face and a narrower mouth. Claire stayed somewhat consistent, tho never as much as could be liked (and yes, as Diana says, the boobage got out of control a few times.  I've noticed that comic book boobs are growing at an exponential rate, rather like The Blob in that old movie.... this is observable in action throughout.  They grow and shrink like the wet-nurse they mistook her for.)        Murtagh fell prey to the mutating drawings, as well.  Dougal not as badly, but he appeared in fewer scenes.      The other problem I had with the art were the eyes.  In many pages, the eyes were just not symmetrical with the face at all.  Several times Claire had one big eye and one small eye (in a full frontal shot) or Jamie had one slanted and one not slanted.  Colouring is hit or miss, too, as Claire's eyes change from green to root beer brown and are never the whiskey-colour mentioned in the books.  Nitpick, nitpick.  I also found myself wondering why she had so much eyeshadow on at the bar whilst getting drunk before marrying Jamie.    I also can't help but wonder what happened with Claire seeing the smallpox scar onGeilie; as the GN left that out, which is a pretty significantly important plot point.     I will say, I loved the portrait of Ellen.  And Ned is amazing. :)    I'm not concerned about the art matching my mental images of the characters; I'm perfectly fine with Diana and Hoang having a different mental vision than my unimportant one.  But I AM concerned about the art matching itself!  And, since half the fun of reading a graphic novel is the, well, graphics; I'd like them to show consistency and reliability.    I agree with the other reviewers who stated that you'd really need to have a working knowledge of the book Outlander to really comprehend what's going on in this book, as it's jampacked with action and mutating faces, making it difficult to keep up with what's what.    Overall, it was a fun read, but I'm glad I didn't pay full price for it.  It could have used another few months in nitpick hell on the art, it just feels rushed.
0439023483|5.0|I admit when I picked up this book it was just for my book club and I didn't even care that there were two other books in the series.  A quarter into the book and it became really good and I enjoyed reading.  After about half way, I could read the book while on the elliptical and not even notice I was working out.  The last night I read it, I read almost 4 hours straight just to finish it and once I was done i dropped it on the ground.  I was upset because now I needed to get the other two books!<br /><br />A good story that is very suspenseful and makes you look at our society a litte different.  It definately has characters you can connect to and shows some morals and values.<br /><br />I thought it was a great book, I heard a rumor of a movie, and I am ordering the 2nd book tonight so I can't wait for all of it!
B00168OINK|2.0|I had heard that this was a hilarious movie.  I found the funny parts to be few and far between.  My kids also laughed, but thought it was kind of slow.
B002N57KG2|5.0|Enjoyed the movie.  No problems, played like brand new.  Received timely, no problems.
B003YCI1PM|3.0|I like Selena Gomez (despite admittedly being far too old to be part of her target audience) and I think that she is a very talented young woman. I bought her first album when it was released last year and really loved it, I still listen to it all the time. So yesterday when the new album was released I had to get it too. Honestly though it was a bit of a disappointment. There are a couple songs I love, but overall it's just ok to me. It's much more pop/dance than I expected from Selena. I just thought she would have a bit more of a rock edge to her music... but, perhaps in the future. This is just generic, \\"been done a thousand times before\\" music. I expected something more original. I was also disappointed to see none of the songs were written by Selena. She wrote the song \\"I Won't Apologize\\" from her debut album and it is my favorite song from that album. It shows such great potential in her as a song writer. I wish she would have at least written one or two songs on the new album. But again, perhaps in the future. What I do like about the album, however, is that the rest of the band has a more vocal presence than they did in the first album. I'd like to see the guys more in the videos as well. My favorite songs from this album are the two singles released thus far, Round & Round and A Year Without Rain. The other track I like quite a bit is Live Like There's No Tomorrow. Ghost Of You isn't too bad. The rest are just \\"eh\\". The worst song from the album, in my opinion, is Summer's Not Hot.     I can turn this on and have the album playing just as \\"background noise\\", not really paying attention to it or truly listening to it. But it just is not an album that I'm going to listen to frequently, and with the exception of a couple songs most of them are not songs I'd sing along with or anything. It's just something so that there is some noise in the house to keep things from being too quiet. It's good upbeat music at least, even if the lyrics are not necessarily that great.
0783229372|3.0|The seller was fine. The actual movie only so so,   but the dvd was as promised.
0374158460|1.0|This book goes against everything this great country was founded on. It seems like the author is trying to say that freedom is bad. What happened to our Constitution? Men fought and DIED for our freedoms and this book is a disgrace! I wish I could give it a 0 because I feel a 1 is too good for it.

B000244FDW|2.0|For a dedicated Austinphile who can't bear not to own every version they can get their hands on, not much will stop them from ordering this version of Pride and Prejudice.  After all, bad reviews certainly didn't stop me.  My intent is to add my voice to the clamor so that not quite so dedicated collectors won't mistake this for anything approaching a quality adaptation.    The costuming, locations, and pacing of the film are actually quite good.  I wish all Austin books would be adapted to film at well over the two hour mark.  I love the much slower pace of life in that time, and you don't at all feel the need to go rushing about from one crisis to the next.    What is woefully missing is any interest whatsoever in the characters themselves.  Jane's goodness fails to shine in any sort of tangible way.  Mary's priggishness was badly scripted enough to actually have her sound quite sensible on several subjects.  Kitty is mere wallpaper, and Lydia registers, but somehow leaves no impression, which isn't good for a character meant to inspire a major family crisis.  Mr. Bennet is completely disconnected from his family, and the gentle and exasperated affection his book self feels for his family is portrayed in a manner that feels critical; you have no sense he even likes his daughters.    And Lizzie - oh my word.  What makes Lizzie so engaging in print and most other screen versions is her sense of the absurd and her ability to share that twinkle in her eye.  This Lizzie is annoying and whiny.  When Mr. Darcy is overheard calling her \\"tolerable\\", she immediately gathers her skirts and runs across the room to tattle in her mother's ear.  She engages in mean spirited gossip for no apparent reason, and for the life of me I cannot find any singular trait in this version that would spark a proud and shy Darcy to be captivated despite himself.  Austin's Lizzie adores laughter, and has a complete sense of the world run mad.  This Lizzie is humorless, dull, and rather dislikable.      Don't waste your money - Lizzie doesn't live here.
B0041YSBKC|5.0|Really love this record.  This record answers the question of \\"What if, instead of doing \\"Darkness on the Edge of Town\\" Bruce Springsteen covered himself in glitter and feathers and decided to write a song cycle about Los Vegas.\\"  A brilliant album, by an ever evolving songwriter.  Well done.
B003MZ0I84|5.0|This was a good cd!! It wasn't as strong as Songs About Jane but I really liked it, I don't listen to it as much but I'll love Maroon 5 forever so for me they can never make anything sound bad!!Okay now I'm disappointed that I bought this deluxe edition and my favorite song isn't even on it, now i have to buy the single of \\"Moves like Jaggar\\" so disapppointed! Now I'm skeptical about buying the deluxe edition of Overexposed because I want it to have all the songs.
B003RUZKC8|3.0|The Losers was a pretty good movie.  A little predictable but acted fairly well and the casting was pretty good.  Not a waste to rent on a Friday Night.
0345505387|1.0|I love the series and was a bit disappointed with the last book she wrote.That one did not get interesting until the last 100 pages and then there were too many lose ends that needed to be tied up. Anyway, I got this at the bookstore and what a bloody waste of $25.00 (list price) that was. Did not like the art  -the characters looked like Asian elf people. The strategically covered cleavages looked more appropriate in a \\"men's magazine\\". Perhaps a  woman artist would not have exaggerated so much. I am not a prude but would have been embarrassed to have anyone see it reading.  Also, only about 1/3 of the book was covered.  Save your $ and get from a library if you must.
B003NX6ZDC|4.0|As the lead singer and key songwriter of The Killers, it's not surprising to find similar and frequent references to Brandon Flowers' hometown of Las Vegas on his first solo record. From the album's title, named after the famous Vegas casino, to the opening track \\"Welcome to the Fabulous Las Vegas,\\" these references are also far from hidden. Although The Killers' second record, Sam's Town, drew many comparisons to Bruce Springsteen, Flamingo plays as if each call came straight from The Boss' playbook.<br /><br />Daniel Lanois, known for his longstanding production relationships with both U2 and Bob Dylan, lends his hand to Flamingo in a very characteristic fashion.<br /><br />The delay effects heard on the album's lead single, \\"Crossfire\\" offer an airy effect reminiscent of nearly every U2 album while the added presence and clarity of the vocals within the mix puts the importance of the lyrics in focus. This is actually what sets Flowers' solo venture apart from the three existing Killers records.<br /><br />Under The Killers' umbrella, guitar solos and more elaborate instrumental sections provide the driving force of the music, but Lanois' mixes keep all of the instrumentation ever so slightly in the distance.<br /><br />Fans of The Killers will not be disappointed with Flowers' solo outing. There are less standout singles, but as a whole, Flamingo is an enjoyable side-step from the grandiose anthems The Killers have provided us for the better part of a decade.<br /><br />Similar Artists: The Killers, Bruce Springsteen<br /><br />Track Suggestion: \\"Crossfire\\"
1590200918|4.0|I have always enjoyed Susan Hill's ghost stories. She never strikes me as having a strong voice of her own as a writer, but she is superb at emulating others. In the case of her ghost/horror stories, she puts the reader firmly down in the tradition of the Victorian and Edwardian tales, and with a firm nod to the works of the likes of M.R. James. The university lecturer, the cosy fire in his lodgings, a glass of whisky, the terrible tale of a haunting that has blighted his life. All the cliches are there, and they are part of why I read these books. The Man in the Picture is more of a long short story. I got through it in a couple of lunch break reading sessions. While it doesn't have the resonance of The Woman in Black and is a much slighter tale, I was entertained and I will certainly look forward to any more such stories that Susan Hill may write. A collection of ghost stories would be good...
B003DT19F0|3.0|Tinker Bell and the Great Fairy Rescue is a cute movie, very 'short and sweet' for little kids.  However - speaking from my personal opinion here - it falls far short when compared to the first two movies in this series.  This story is certainly entertaining, but<br />also seems incomplete and generic, and the colors in the film seem somewhat muted.  None of the majesty and vibrancy from the previous<br />dvds is related in this latest entry.  The interaction also leaves much to be desired - I can easily see many young children being frightened by the thought of Lizzie's professor dad wanting to 'hurt' the fairies.  Having a villain really doesn't make sense.  The other fairies are either involved in silly gags or unnecessary arguing.  And, \\"fairy summer camp\\"?  Really?<br /><br />To make matters worse, this movie barely clocks in at 70 minutes!  This latest Disney Fairies dvd just seems out of place in the series, as if it was rushed through production.  Really hope the next installment is up to the same high level of quality as Tinker Bell & TB and the Lost Treasure.
0345505387|1.0|Having anticipated the release of this novel for quite some time, I cannot even begin to explain how disappointed I am.  Being a HUGE fan of the Outlander Saga, I had very high hopes for this \\"graphic novel\\" and expected it to be something great.  I found the artwork and dialog to be cheesy, and almost laughable.  Since when does Claire have DD's?  Maybe if a female artist would have done this COMIC BOOK, things would have been better.  I thought that I was going to be hearing Jamie's side of the story, and instead I got a picture book.  If you are at all a Jamie & Claire fan, you are guaranteed to be disappointed.
B003TML0VO|4.0|It becomes obvious that some people just cannot like anything done to classics like these and while I have every one of these in the original I love all of these renditions (with the possible exception of Dance the Night Away which I question it's existence on this CD at all).  I seldom like artists redoing others well known songs but this is a whole nother ball game with Santana, you will be impressed.<br /><br />These are classic cuts that will never be replaced BUT with todays equipment you cannot get some of them in a real high quality sounds and this is the best release of some of them I have heard and Santana makes them all the more great with his personal flair.<br /><br />Bottom line:  If you liked the original of these songs and you like Santana's guitar playing you are gonna love this.  I am not replacing my originals but I am adding most of these to my favorite play lists.  Since I liked most of them in a 5 star manner the 2 I liked the least were Dancing the Night Away and Back in Black (a different vocalist would have made this better)<br /><br />PS -  To the guy who said he was never impressed with Santana's playing ?????  WTF are you smokin?
B003PIUBZS|2.0|I had no idea this show was going to be as bad as it is. After reading all of the Amazon.com reviews, it sounds like it's up there with Sopranos, Dexter, Six Feet Under, The Shield and all the other truly engrossing, intelligent series.<br /><br />This is like watching a very bad cartoon come to life. It's extremely tedious also. Cavemen and cavewomen are mad - they seek vengeance. That sums it up.<br /><br />Over and over. And over. Guess what the first episode's about?<br /><br />Guess what the second episode's about? Guess what the 12th episode's about? Now, maybe if you're as cerebrally challenged as these folks, you may forget, after each episode, the basic crux of the show.<br />So it may not bother you that the same b.s. happens, over and over.<br /><br />I need more to entertain me. And the bodies, as great as they are, aren't enough to sustain my interest. I have porn (with similarly lousy plots) to watch instead.<br /><br />My biggest gripe with this series is the cgi. I always disliked soap operas, especially when they would go 'outdoors.' Here, it's the same thing. The lighting is painful. It looks unreal and it's unbelievably distracting.<br /><br />I warned you.
B003NWS5AO|4.0|Before Robert Plant had even met Jimmy Page and formed Led Zeppelin, Plant was in a group named Band of Joy. By titling his newest solo release after his former band, Plant hints at a return to his roots; bringing his fans back to where he got his start and pulling from his earliest of influences.<br /><br />With the exception of needing to drop the keys down a few half steps, Robert Plant sounds exactly the same as he did during the golden years of Led Zeppelin.<br /><br />Picking up where he left off with Alison Krauss and Raising Sand, Band of Joy opens with Los Lobos' \\"Angel Dance,\\" transformed into an Americana folk melody. The following track, Richard Thompson's \\"House of Cards,\\" slows the tempo and introduces Patty Griffin's harmonization while maintaining enough similarities in style to blend perfectly with the surrounding songs on the album.<br /><br />Band of Joy may be a collection of covers with only one exception, but every song feels uniquely Plant's.<br /><br />Produced alongside Buddy Miller, slow ballads like \\"Silver Rider\\" cleverly find common ground with the upbeat rock style of \\"You Can't Buy My Love.\\" While Plant's work with Alison Krauss broke new ground, Band of Joy re-tills classic tracks, turning his roots into a beautiful new garden.<br /><br />Similar Artists: Joni Mitchell, Neil Young<br /><br />Track Suggestion: \\"Angel Dance\\"
B002XTBEDI|5.0|A great BBC production that helps tie up loose ends of The Cranford Chronicles.  Both my husband and I found this a delightful movie to watch.
B000KIPT30|5.0|this is surprisingly tough, all metal enclosure and solid knobs.  it is a very simple thing, great for a home studio.  if you don't want to spend much money and want a headphone splitter/amp that works, this is the thing to get.  only complaint is that it's not very mountable and can get tossed around, but the solid construction keeps it all together.
0765326353|5.0|It's always good to read a major new series that is sure to be one of the greats.  \\"Way of Kings\\" by Sanderson is a taut, well paced introduction to a 10 book cycle.<br /><br />Page one, scene one, assassin walks in in plain sight (and battle) to assassinate the king (hours after a recent treaty).  Wow!  Sanderson captures the scene with brilliant literary sparkling prose.  Action is not at a shortage.<br /><br />The various concepts he introduces are remarkable.  Stormlight, Shardbearer, and shardplate re interesting.  3-D imagery is interesting in the book.<br /><br />The rest of the book (900 pages plus) is filled with deep characters, Kaladin, Shallan, and Dalinar.  The Parashendi line themselves up as worthy opponents, and with their past (and potential), drive the main characters admirably.<br /><br />Stephen King can write a 1000 page book, and Sanderson can write one, and I will take Sanderson anyday!<br /><br />Great cover and interior art.<br /><br />This is a book not to be missed!

B001USHRCK|5.0|My son got this for his 9th birthday. He is a huge lego fan and this is the biggest set I have purchased for him so far. It took him about 6 hours to build this one and he is really proud of it. He says it has the best accessories ever, he is really into all of the special little pieces always included with the lego sets. Definitely a good purchase for the money and it arrived just in time.
B0041YSBKC|5.0|It's safe to say that it appears Brandon Flowers purposely avoided creating something that would be held to the standards of a Killers release.  It's a very wide array of styling and vocal presentation, and if you got the deluxe 14-song version, there are some quirky, yet catchy tunes added.  It's hard for me to compare Brandon's style to anything current (aside from The Killers), especially being a member of the \\"I hate what's on the radio right now\\" crowd, and I think that's what draws me into it.<br /><br />Opening with \\"Welcome to Fabulous Las Vegas\\" certainly sets the stage for the album, just like its city namesake, you never know what to expect, but there's a good bet it's going to be amazing!  Tracks like \\"Jilted Lovers & Broken Hearts\\", \\"Magdalena\\", and \\"Crossfire\\" really anchor the album well, and the slower \\"Playing With Fire\\" & \\"Only The Young\\" make it a wide-reaching collection.  I don't find any of these tracks boring, and being a Killers fan, I found \\"Everything Will Be Alright\\" from Hot Fuss, and \\"Goodnight, Travel Well\\" from Day & Age to be relentlessly boring.  Overall, I think Brandon did a great job of showing what he can do with his \\"solo legs\\" and for compiling a pleasantly addicting listen.  This one is definitely getting a lot of play on my iPod!
B002MQYOFW|4.0|i love this book. it's one of those books that will make you turn each page and wonder how it's going to turn out for our Katniss. Great read. Never boring.
0596004966|4.0|In all honesty I expected way too much out of this product. I was looking for a full reference book and tried to take the less pricey alternative and my plan failed miserably. Though the pocket reference has all the basics, it lacks anything of the in-depth nature. Most likely if learning C++ from a book, than there would be little need for this seeing as how the text would most likely define everything it uses as well as everything found in this book. This reference would be useful for anyone just starting who would like more (although few in number) examples of what you're learning. This makes a nice accompaniment text but is not a useful primary source. I would also recommend this as a book to carry around in order to study the language and review both concepts and syntax.    All in all not a bad secondary source of learning C++. This makes a great study-aid or review source for beginning levels but hat's just about it. If you've made it through two books already, than I would recommend investing in a real reference, though this is good for on the go.
B003TML0VO|5.0|First of all, this needs to be prefaced by pointing out that this project was not originally Carlos' idea. It is my understanding that \\"Guitar Heaven: The Greatest Guitar Classics of All Time\\" was in fact, Clive Davis' suggestion/assignment (challenge?) for Carlos to deliver an album of time-tested and proven guitar-heavy hits of the past by other artists. With that task at hand, the great Santana assembled his band and augmented it with some notable and popular vocalists, and chose some of what presumably were his \\"favorites\\" that could work, or fit into what is unmistakably a \\"concept album\\". Make no mistake about it, that is precisely what this album is. Make no mistake either, that this is as much a Clive Davis album as much as it is a Santana album. The choice of which songs to go with were equally split between Carlos and Clive. I'm not so sure that from a commercial point of view, this is a bad idea, since the two have collaborated and succeeded in bringing Carlos back to the radio several times; not to mention a ride to the Grammy awards.<br /><br />Having said all of that, for my money, this album succeeds on many levels. For today's Guitar Hero/Air Guitar playing youth, it should serve well to expose some of said youth to some classics which they may not otherwise have been made aware of. While every guitar-toting and aspiring kid of today has not only heard, but can likely already play (very well, I might add) Led Zeppelin's \\"Whole Lotta Love\\", AC-DC's \\"Back In Black\\", and Deep Purple's \\"Smoke On the Water\\" riffs, I doubt that many of them know Jeff Beck's version of \\"Ain't Superstitious\\" or The Rolling Stones' \\"Can't You Hear Me Knocking\\", for example. The album also drives home the point that Carlos *IS* indeed one bad mofo on electric guitar, and someone whom they would do good to listen to and study from a strictly shredding and technique point of view. There is a LOT of fierce guitar playing on this album, which is something that I for one, welcome with open heart and mind. I can't even remember the last time I heard a guitar solo on the radio that captured my attention, or even a guitar solo at all, for that matter. Forgive my biased opinion there, as not only have I been a huge fan of Carlos and his playing from day one, I am also a guitarist. Kudos to Carlos and Clive, because for that reason more than any other, not only is \\"Guitar Heaven\\" (hmm, \\"GH\\"... coincidence?) a great album, but does in fact hold up to repeated listening.<br /><br />Not even out one full day, and of course, all of the critics are already panning and dismissing the effort as nothing more than a sell-out, a calculated commercial attempt, or worse, as sacrilegious blasphemy that anyone would dare attempt to even touch these revered and holy classics which they grew up on. They miss the entire point that first and foremost, this album is for guitar players and lovers of good guitar playing; something we have been deprived of for some time now, due to bad-old radio playlisting and payola. Anything other than that, such as having been made also for fans of the great singers featured here, Today's production values, and more, including, well, *FUN* is icing on the cake.<br /><br />From the first strains of the classic riff of Led Zeppelin's \\"Whole Lotta Love\\", it is blatantly obvious that this project is about kick-ass rocking and paying tribute to some great music. Chris Cornell of Soundgarden and Audioslave does such a good job here that he (dare I say it?) makes Robert Plant's original performance sound like Mickey Mouse on steroids. The choice of Cornell's strong vocals is more than appropriate here. While he does not stray from the original in melody and phrasing, (probably for fear that if the opening track were to sound too different or foreign, listeners might not give the rest of the album a chance) Cornell succeeds in updating this old chestnut, no doubt. The underlying trademark Santana percussion section here is the only hint here so far, that this is indeed Santana you are listening to. It is still far too early to do that yet.<br /><br />The second track, \\"Can't You Hear Me Knocking\\" also opens with an unmistakable and instantly recognizable guitar riff. Scott Weiland of Stone Temple Pilots and Velvet Revolver fame does a great job here as well by not straying too far from Mick Jagger's original delivery. Already, I am getting the feeling that Carlos, in his infinite wisdom, is well aware that SOME things are best left unchanged. Even though gone is any alluding of Bobby Keys' brilliant saxophone solo, it is not missed one bit as Carlos' signature playing slips in to replace it. Interesting side note here: on the day of the release of \\"Sticky Fingers\\", a guitar-playing friend of mine played a trick on me. He put on the original record, cued exactly at the spot where Mick Taylor's beautiful guitar solo comes in, and asked who I thought I was listening to. I immediately responded with: \\"Santana\\". My friend laughed and replied: \\"Guess again\\". As I listened intently not only to that solo, but also to the rhythm section bubbling underneath it, I repeated: \\"Santana\\", afterall, who else could it be? Boy, was I surprised when my friend produced the album cover, declaring: \\"The Rolling Stones!\\", with a childish grin on his face. That was 1971, and already Santana was exerting an influence on the landscape of popular music, including the greatest Rock N Roll band that ever lived. I think that here, Carlos is doing more than just paying tribute to a great song, but is re-paying homage as well.<br /><br />By the third song, it is slowly but surely becoming apparent that this is Santana of the old days. I am reminded that Carlos has always paid tribute by doing covers of others' works. From the first album, \\"Jingo\\" (Olatunji) through \\"Oye Como Va\\" (Tito Puente), \\"She's Not There\\" (The Zombies), and others, Santana has always been mindful of his roots. Let's not forget here that the original name of the group was \\"The Santana Blues Band\\". Rob Thomas (Matchbox Twenty), no stranger to Santana fans, returns to lend his soulful and passionate vocal skills to the mix. \\"Sunshine Of Your Love\\", the classic Cream song is re-worked here with more fire and balls than the original thanks again to the Santana percussion ensemble playing. The updated and modernized production techniques and values of the present day give this old gem a new life, in my opinion. I can't help but wonder what Carlos' good friend Eric Clapton, and Jack Bruce make of this take. I also can't help but wonder if this means that we will see Eric guesting on sporadic dates if this album is commercially successful enough to tour. I certainly hope so.<br /><br />\\"While My Guitar Gently Weeps\\", the next tune, is where I have mixed feelings. Having had a week to listen to this one, as Carlos has had it up on his website for the world to preview, I have to say that on the overall, it is good. That is probably due to the \\"growing on me\\" factor. First of all, being the huge George Harrison fan that I am, I am always protective of George's compositions and my feelings on said compositions and the original versions as well. Harrison's works simply cannot be improved for my money, leave them alone, please. However, as I have listened to this one over and over, I can finally say that I \\"get it\\". Not only do the title and lyrics of this brilliant song alone manage to convey what I think this entire album is trying to get across, it's inclusion here and the arrangement make it such that it is almost a whole different song. It serves well to separate this collection by nature of being a soft and sentimental ballad, and gives the entire album an all-inclusive cohesion that would otherwise would not have been present had it all been wailing, blasting, and shredding. Kudos to India Arie for her beautiful singing on this one. Being a guitarist and multi-instrumentalist herself, she brings a warm sensibility to the project which a song such as this one begs. My only complaint on this song, and in fact, the entire album, is the shameless waste of the truly masterful  chops of the one and only Yo-Yo Ma. It's as if he was rushed in on the strength of his name alone, and was given as simple and basic a part to play which most any good High School cellist could have provided. Then on top of that, the part is mixed so low that it is hardly noticeable at times. Clive would have done better to rename this one \\"While My Cello Gently Weeps\\", then let Yo-Yo Ma shred all over the top of it. Then again, I am certain that something like that would have been considered sacrilege by the stuffy old purists.<br /><br />Def Leppard's 80's hit \\"Photograph\\", to my ears, and my opinion, is the weakest track on the album. To include Chris Daughtry as the vocalist may at first wreak of what appears to be nothing more than someone's greedy desire to cash in on the American Idol craze. As with most anything, however, with enough listening, it too will probably grow on you if for no other reason than 80's nostalgia, even if this project was never about nostalgia. Although the song was probably Def Leppard's biggest hit, it never did anything for me; it still doesn't, as a song. Def Leppard was a much better band than that tune implied at the time. I skipped it then, and to be honest, I will likely find myself skipping it on subsequent listenings of this album. Maybe had Clive or Carlos pushed to at least have Joe Elliott, the original singer of the song appear, things would have been different. However, that would probably have also pushed the budget beyond what was deemed (pre-ordained?) appropriate for the project or \\"artistically\\" in step with what Carlos and Clive were trying to achieve. Were it not due to my penchant for Carlos' guitar playing, I don't think that I would have even sat through the entire song on first listening.<br /><br />Oh boy, \\"Back In Black\\", AC/DC. Myself, I love it, but what do I know? I can see the purists up in arms already, much as they did with Run DMC's version of Aerosmith's \\"Walk This Way\\". I can't help but laugh at something like that kind of mentality. \\"What? Rapping on an AC/DC song?? How DARE they??? What the????\\" On and on, ad nauseum. This is the track to most likely turn off the purists and critics and slam the album as they have already begun to do. In my opinion, Nas' inclusion here keeps the album contemporary and his performance is strong. The entire track is a pure example of Santana's ever-present knack for fusion and bringing together different genre of music and more importantly, people of vastly different cultural backgrounds. If Arista knows what's good for it, they will quickly issue this one as a single. It is probably the most radio-ready track on the album by today's standards and trends. While Mashups have yet to really catch on over here, it's a different story on a global scale. Not only that, but let us also remember that Run DMC single-handedly resurrected Aerosmith's career, which was pretty much in the toilet prior to that one being all over the radio, MTV, and in your face that year.<br /><br />\\"Riders On the Storm\\", the old classic from The Doors gets the Santana treatment with good effect. Chester Bennington of Linkin Park does an admirable job of crooning this lyric in a way that Jim Morrison could never have done. Although I am a fan of The Doors and of Jim Morrison's singing, Morrison's voice was simply too harsh for this lyric, and Bennington brings his Depeche Mode influence to the mix, allowing these lyrics to breahte nicely. Bonus points for including Ray Manzarek here. Ray is well accustomed and more than adept at embracing the modern scene as both musician and producer. Hey, they had to include something in this collection to appease and assuage however many California hippies might be left out there, they buy product too. Better this than oh, say, Jefferson Airplane or Grateful Dead, for example.<br /><br />\\"Smoke On The Water\\" originally done by Deep Purple is up next. I happen to teach guitar, and I can tell you that this is the riff most often played by beginning students when I first ask them to: \\"Just play a little and show me some of the things you know\\". It is not only a timeless melody, but it is also so easy to play, that even a kid starting out can practically pick it out by ear unless someone showed them how to do it. Jacoby Shaddix of Papa Roach handles the vocal chores here and delivers a solid performance. Carlos' playing is all over the track to good effect, and to my ears, is not as identifiable in some spots as is usually the case. He is playing with abandon here and having fun at the same time. That is another feeling that this album leaves me with, that everyone involved was enjoying themselves and having fun with these old classics, just like we did when we were kids in a garage, the high school shows, or some block party, or a community center somewhere. Again, my own bias rears it's head here, because I will never be able to resist any version of a song that contains the lyric \\"Frank Zappa And The Mothers were at the best place around\\".<br />Shut Up 'N Play Yer Guitar, indeed; which Carlos is a master at, since he hardly ever does a lead vocal himself, content to let someone else sing, as he wails away and makes faces in the background, which is primarily, a \\"Lead Guitar\\" player's job.<br /><br />The next tune, \\"Dance The Night Away\\" (Van Halen) features Pat Monahan, from the band Train. It is here that it hits me like a ton of bricks that the vast majority of singers on this album are all good songwriters themselves, in their own right. That fact alone, ensured that more than anything else, the song being recorded was being served by people who understand what a good song is, from under the hood, much like a good mechanic understands an automobile in a way that a consumer does not. I highly doubt that was an accident. Monahan does an awesome job here as do all of the others, and this is the one that most ALMOST sounds like the original singer. No offense to David Lee Roth, but he is often imitated by many to some degree of success. Pat comes closer than anyone I have heard on this one. I have to admit at this point, that I am a classic rock fantatic, and that I am a sucker for most any old great song done by anyone by preference over most of what passes for popular music these days. I also can't help but feel targeted. You hit your mark, Mr. Davis.<br /><br />Track Ten, \\"Bang A Gong\\" (T. Rex) features Gavin Rossdale of the British band, Bush. This version goes to show how a great song is a great song is a great song, and there is not much anyone can do to truly ruin it. Blondie, Joe Perry, Ministry, Power Station, and countless others have released versions with success. In every single case, any time I hear any version of this song, it immediately makes me miss Marc Bolan first, more than any other thought before I even have a chance to listen. Witness Prince's song \\"Cream\\" if you need further proof that this is indeed a classic song worthy of covering or paying tribute to. It is fitting that a Brit was chosen for this track, as Marc Bolan was British. Rossdale does a commendable job here of not over-powering the song, or injecting too much of his particular style into it. This entire album, in fact, makes me think that someone was \\"policing\\" it during the entire recording in order that it not sound too much like the bands of the artists doing the singing. For my money (again) this is a good thing. I can hear someone repeating: \\"this IS, Carlos and Clive here, boys\\". It goes without saying that Carlos' inimitable guitar playing is the only other \\"star\\" here, other than the songs. His playing is in top form, if you ask me. Anyone who is sick of Carlos' riffs, sound, or choice of notes, go elsewhere, because THAT is what you are getting here, more than anything else. It is really what you are paying for.<br /><br />Jimi Henrix, Joe Cocker, and Carlos Santana; now how can you go wrong with a collaboration like that? \\"Little Wing\\", Jimi's tender ballad is given the Santana treatment here and still manages to come across as beautiful as ever. This is perhaps the principal song of the collection that sounds like something the featured singer, could have released on one of his own albums. My only disappointment here is that Carlos did not make the effort to tackle Jimi's original intro to the song, which to me, is an integral part of the piece. I would never dream of playing this song without that intro, which I first learned as a kid when the original was first released, in order to impress a girl in school who loved it and always wished that someone would play it for her on the guitar. Just like Santana's guitar voice, Joe Cocker's voice is undeniably all his own, and can not be replicated faithfully by anyone else. Spare me the John Belushi parody or send-up comparison, don't even go there, okay?<br /><br />The ancient blues standard, \\"I ain't superstitious\\", written in 1961 by the great Willie Dixon, and first recorded by Dixon with the equally great Howlin' Wolf is the oldest song of the collection.<br />It was later introduced to a generation of blues-rock fans by one Mr. Jeff Beck on his debut album, sung by Rod Stewart. This is a song that has been covered by countless artists, and will probably continue to be done forever. It is honestly that good of a song, and was an instant classic the moment it was composed. The amazing Johnny Lang provides the vocals on this one, and going by his performance here, it is as if the tune was tailor-made for him. Carlos manages to find an impeccable sense of balance here between remaining true to the song, as to his own vision equally.<br /><br />I have to interject here that the album is available in two configurations. There is the 12-track CD as I have reviewed here, and a deluxe edition. The deluxe version includes two bonus songs and an almost thirty-minute dvd which is comprised of a documentary on the making of the album, and an intimate interview with Carlos and Clive sitting side-by-side, discussing the project. The first of the two bonus tracks is \\"Fortunate Son\\" (originally recorded by Creedence Clearwater Revival) featuring Scott Stapp of Creed on vocals. The second bonus track is The Red Hot Chili Peppers song,\\"Under the Bridge\\" featuring Andy Vargas on lead vocals. Andy has been Santana's lead singer since the \\"Supernatural\\" Tour. Just like the other songs on the regular edition, these tunes are \\"Santana-ized\\" (to quote Clive from the dvd) with great success. That is to say, they are made to sound (in Carlos' own words, also from the dvd) \\"as completely new/totally familiar\\". There was never any doubt in my mind that purchasing the deluxe edition is the way to go. It helps a great deal to know and see the background and artistic development involved if one is to fully grasp and appreciate this very special project, and not see it as a carefully crafted, contrived, and blatant attempt to cash in on any trend or pattern.<br /><br />I have now spent the past twelve hours listening to, absorbing, and dissecting \\"Guitar Heaven: The Greatest Guitar Classics Of All Time\\". My verdict is that given a chance, you may find this to be one of the best albums to come down the pike in a long time. Should you buy it? The answer is don't listen to the critics, read reviews, or allow yourself to be persuaded by expectations or pre-conceived notions, and buy it, play it a few times, and decide for yourself. For me, like for Clive Davis, it is the album I have been waiting for Santana to make for years. As a final note, I would like to add a special mention to, and believe that kudos are in order for Santana's band, especially to drummer Dennis Chambers for giving of themselves precisely what this project called for, and then some.<br /><br />Eddie \\"brontis\\"Goicuria<br />September 21, 2010.

030726999X|5.0|The whole series was a Can't Put Down, Stay up late joy to read.  Couldn't wait to read how it turned out and then was sorry it was over.
B0036EH40Q|5.0|This was delivered a day or so earlier than scheduled. A great price for this.
6304712944|4.0|Was there ever a more congenial spot, or a more endearing spot, than Camelot? Was there ever a more exciting spot than Camelot? This outstanding production, a must-see, will allow anyone to know that in any case there was not.  The acting was well-done, each part fitting each person the way a hand and a glove fit each other. A more suitable actor to play King Arthur could not be found than Richard Harris. Vanessa Redgrave was the most charming Guenevere who could be found. Franco Nero, with his boyish good looks, charm, French accent, and unsurpassed vanity was patented for the part of Sir Lancelot. The color was beautiful, the love scenes were warm and romantic, the jousting was exciting, and the landscape was breath-taking. The movie was in a few places a tiny bit boring, but only a very tiny bit, and the places were very few. The beautiful songs so well sung with rich voices will always be adhesive to the mind. Again, there was a good mele of excitement and love. I'm glad I've seen it more than once.
B003TML0VO|4.0|Ok this is not the greatest Cd of Carlos Santana's carear but really...Why are people who DO NOT even really like his music submitting reviews of this CD???  If you are not crazy about his style then why did you buy it???  This CD is rather good...Excellent in places such as Whole Lotta Love, Can You Hear Me Knockin' and Sunshine of your Love to name a few...Now a few of the tracks puzzle me...Photograph...Really??? This song does not really sound that great...Like they are trying to immitate the Drum sound of Def Leppard...and there are far more valid songs that could have taken it's place.  I am also not crazy about the use of electronic drums in While My Guitar Gently Weeps.  On the most part, Carlos takes these classic songs and makes them his own...If you like Santana you will like this CD.
B000AMJC2K|5.0|Build quality and ease of installation are very good.  I type pretty hard (a lot of banging on the keys), so the monitor does shake a little bit; I wonder if I changed the angle of the arm if it would be steadier.  Not a real problem but was mentioned in another review.  Lost one VESA mount screw b/c the baggie it was in had a rip.  Otherwise, 15 minutes to being much happier with my ergonomics.
030745455X|5.0|This book was a terrific read. It follows seamlessly from where book one ended. It is fast paced, and tightly constructed. I hearily recommend this book to all who enjoy a well-plotted novel. This book is part of my permanent collection.
B0029LX2LC|5.0|The Roots have done it again with their latest album \\"How I Got Over\\".  The lyrics are deep accompanied by the beats which seperates The Roots from other wannabe Hip Hop Artists.  With their songs being full of emotion and soul, any person Roots Fan or not can appreciate this Album or any of their earlier albums for that matter.
B0007939NO|5.0|When I first saw the M-G-M movie BRIGADOON, I was greatly touched. Though I'm going backwards, I will have to say that the touching ending almost made me cry tears of happiness. Gene Kelly played so very well Tommy, a kind American so much in love with Fiona, the prettiest lady in Brigadoon. And as it has been proven in other movies, Kelly was so unusually talented at dancing. Van Johnson was very adept at making the viewing public laugh at the \\"pleasant\\" drunk. And the beautiful Cyd Charisse! Why wouldn't the love-sick Tommy want to return to Brigadoon?!Cyd Charisse was at the pinnacle of success in her acting career in this movie: none of her other parts ever even approached her charm and acting ability as did the part of the lovely Scottish lady. The capabilities of Lerner and Lowe were heard loud and clear. All in all, it was an enchanting movie.
1400052173|2.0|Maybe it just wasn't my cup of tea, but I found this book really boring. Don't get me wrong, the author is an excellent writer and I actually would love to read her second book (this was her first). Specifically, I really didn't enjoy all the details surrounding her investigation of the subject's past. I mean, who wants to read about the author driving around town and eating BBQ and going into structures and just generally hanging out and talking to people? Not me! The story has some good elements but overall it's just not strong enough to carry this off.     I would say that this was a valiant attempt to write a biography on a limited subject by an obviously talented writer, but the subject matter just wasn't compelling enough. I honestly can't wait until Rebecca Skloot gets her hands on a more complex, interesting story (perhaps with some science intermingled in the storyline since her background is in scientific writing). But for now, sadly, I can't recommend this book.
B001FB4W0C|5.0|Supernatural has been one of my favorite shows since it first aired. And this season's \\"In the Beginning\\" has been my favorite episode to date - the writing never gets old. So thrilled for the season premiere of season 6 this week!
1439181780|5.0|With all my heart, I believe Rhonda did a magnificent job in both of her books, first The Secret and then The Power.    Both of them are based on the two a hundred year old books:  The Science of Getting Rich and The Master Key System.    I believe that with out Rhonda incredible introduction, there are no human being to understand the previous books.  Everything is linked.   If  yesterday the \\"church\\" censored both of them, today they can't.   Here is the magic of it.   I serioiusly recomend anyone to read either books, and they will be great. besides, the law of atraction will follow only those who understand it.   If you are in the search for it,  you will get it.          It happened to me:  I have been all my life in constant search for \\"the truth\\".   It is really up to  you if  you find it.         Love, Daniel E. Martinez.
B0034G4OVS|3.0|Three young skiers (Kevin Zegers, Shawn Ashmore and Emma Bell) are trapped on a chairlift, halfway up the mountain. The ski resort will be closed for the next five days, so chances are they have to remain where they are, out in the cold, until the next weekend, by which time they will have been frozen to death; or they have to do something to avoid the fate.    Like \\"Open Water,\\" a film about two hapless swimmers left alone in the sea, \\"Frozen\\" is based on a premise that is not exactly implausible. Writer/director Adam Green attempts to create a character-driven, suspense-filled movie based on the premise that I think is too simple for a feature film. In short the story goes nowhere.     For it is obvious that the three stranded skiers have few options to choose, and anyway they take one of them. Occasional gore and grotesque descriptions are not enough to sustain tension for 90 minutes. The three characters' back stories are not very interesting as, after all, we want to know more about what they will do, than what they are.    One great thing about \\"Frozen\\" is that the filmmakers actually shot the film among the snowy mountains (in Utah). No green screen or soundstage is used, and the on-location shots give the film an authentic look and feel. Otherwise, the film is average with its scenario that heavily depends on coincidences and wrong decision making on the part of the characters.
0374158460|2.0|I ordered this book immediately when it became available.  Now, I remember really liking the Corrections, so I figured I'd like this one too.  No.  Not really.  I'm slogging through it and find it incredibly tedious.  Some of his charactors seem unrealistic and it's fair to say I am disappointed.  I read the article about him in Time magazine and couldn't wait to get the book.  Yikes.  I'm not too sure I'll finish this one.  I wonder if the President will, too.  He picked his advance copy up in Martha's Vineyard and I think everyone wanted a copy after that.  Too bad about this.
0345505387|4.0|I really enjoyed reading The Exile. I have not read a lot of Graphic Novels, but this one is really well done. The pictures are beautiful. I love seeing a \\"picture\\" of Jamie, Claire, and Murtaugh. It was fun seeing Mrs. Fitz's reaction to Claire's undergarments and generally stuff we never saw in the actual Outlander novel.     I did not have any problem with the abrvieated story line, it is a GN and only so much can be fit into the story. I think if you have not read Outlander, a reader might get confused with the story line. and I did notice at the beginning of the novel, when we see Jamie's backside, there are no scars.     I am surprised by all the negative reviews, and I am glad I have this book to add to my Outlander collection.
B002C6K7NU|4.0|Not only is the music solid - sound, style and message - it is fun to suport a band willing to stand up and speak out against what is going on in Washington DC.  Great music for any flag waving American that would love to see the return of leadership like Ronald Reagan.
0374158460|4.0|The number of one-star reviews of this book based on the fact that the reviewers are finding some kind of Communist plot encased in the novel is completely bizarre. There must be some sort of Glenn Beck/Tea Party conspiracy here...and it seems to me that most of the one-star people haven't even read the book. This book isn't about how \\"freedom is bad.\\" It's about how the self-absorption and obsession with being \\"free\\" (in a Janis Joplin kind of way) can be a debilitating trap for the Baby Boom generation.     I also take issue with those who dismiss the book because the characters aren't \\"likeable.\\" The characters - particularly Patty - are honest, flawed, compelling, and representative of our times - and most of all, REAL. If you've read Franzen's previous novel, \\"The Corrections,\\" you know to expect a realistic portrayal of a dysfunctional family trying to navigate through the challenges and pitfalls of our times. \\"Freedom\\" does this just as movingly and effectively.     I only dock this book one star, because it did feel a tiny bit bloated to me. But overall, it was a great read - an artifact that future generations will turn to when they want to know more about living in America at the turn of the 21st century.

B002VPE1B6|5.0|AVATAR is a great movie if not the greatest so far. Images, colors,  originality, tension and suspense makes it a most entertaining movie. Cameron has surpassed himself with this movie. Too bad this movie did not get the Academy Awards. The message is clear in the movie, preserve your planet, or mother earth, or perish! We should take warning that we are borrowing energy from our planet and not returning it. I watch this movie, almost, every other day. Can't get enough of it!<br /><br />The movie was delivered on time and I'm very pleased with my purchase.

0385504209|2.0|Generally, I try very hard to tread carefully when I write a negative review of an international bestseller.  I'm not going to bother this time.  I'm sorry if I offend Dan Brown's fans, but this book deserves a lashing.<br /><br />First, I'll explain the two stars.  I thought about giving it one.  But it got two, since I made it to the end of the book.  Also, Dan Brown's \\"facts\\" stirred me enough to do my own research, so I did learn things I didn't know before.<br /><br />Beyond that, however, there was nothing in this book I hadn't already experienced in Angels and Demons.  Naked old man found dead in a strange position -- check.  Token female scientist (who also happens to be hot) -- check. Poems written in iambic pentameter -- check.  Clues that could only make sense to our reluctant (and boring) hero, Robert Langdon -- check.  Factually incorrect information -- check, check, and double check.  Honestly, the plot \\"twists\\" at the end weren't even a surprise to me, because I knew how Angels and Demons ended, and Da Vinci ended the same way.  If anyone other than Dan Brown had written this book, it would have been considered plagiarism.<br /><br />Additionally, for a book that flaunts \\"the sacred feminine\\" on every page, why is it that Brown's one female protagonist (Sophie) is an idiot?  She can't figure anything out on her own, and she needs a male baby-sitter to coax her into solving this mystery?  Maybe the author should have given her a copy of Angels and Demons before sending her on her quest.  Da Vinci Code would have been much shorter.<br /><br />And finally, I echo what countless others have already stated: There are so many factual errors in this book that it can drive an educated person crazy.  I took a *basic* humanities course in college, about six years ago, and I still recognized many of the errors in Langdon's lectures.  I can only imagine that true art historians must be pulling their hair out.
B0002S947K|5.0|Trouble is Ray Lamontagne's first album and when I heard the first track from it, I knew I was in love. Since that moment, I have listened religiously and waited impatiently for new music to be released. Every song is well thought out and sang with so much feeling. Ray's lamentations on Jolene tug at the heart and bring my soul to the edge. Truly worth purchasing, and then make sure you buy the other 3 as well.
B003TML0VO|2.0|In short, I had to delete this album from my mp3 player because I simply dislike listening to it. Santana is a respectable guitarist, but he really shouldn't delve into other classic songs with his style because his interpretation and the history behind each song are on different worlds. For instance, his rendition of CCR's Fortunate Son completely eliminates the whole Vietnam feel of the song, which I had grown to love, appreciate, and respect. Another example is his rendition of Led Zeppelin's Whole Lotta Love; the lack of strongly-paced rhythm really takes away from the song's true meaning and substance.    I loved Santana's earlier works, but I'm sorry, this album just blows.

0810997827|1.0|These books are not appropriate for little kids.  The main character is a lying, cheating, self-absorbed brat.  My 7 year-old received the first book as a birthday present and we started reading it together before bedtime.  It wasn't long before I was appalled at the actions of Greg, the main character.  He is a rotten person.  He is manipulative toward parents, teachers, and his poor \\"friend\\" Rowley. I cannot understand how these books are well-received by critics and the public.  Greg does the most outrageous things to get out of work, to fool people, to take-advantage of others; and when it doesn't turn out well for him - there is no lesson learned!  He totally misses the point.  Luckily, my son thinks Greg is mean and we use his actions in the book to discuss what a person should do instead to be a good friend, classmate, brother, etc.     I will not be purchasing any more Wimpy Kid books and I have put out the word to family and friends that these books are a terrible read for the younger set.
B003NWS5AO|1.0|This cd is HORRID! Just like the  new Cd's by Heart, Tom Petty, even Ozzy. They all decide to change their sound and put out lame CRAP! Bottom line is Plants Rocking days are OVER! Now he's just rocking in a chair. Clapton has a new one coming out soon. I wont WASTE my money.
B0001DI0FI|5.0|Holy cow is this ever a great movie. One of the best of the decade in all honesty. It's just an incredibly enthralling adventure. It's long yes but it's so freaking lean. Not one second of it is anything less than mesmerizing. I would kill for this to have been a success and become a franchise.
B000ZNRBK4|5.0|This is just what I expected it to be.  I was mildly disappointed that my 18-55 kit lens didn't come with a hood so I purchased this separately.  It is made of the same material and shares the same quality as the other hoods that came with my other Nikkor lenses.  Easy to use.  Pleasant to look at.

0061876747|4.0|I enjoyed this well written novel.  The characters are well drawn and elicit sympathy.  Though the ending might not ring true, it's been great fun along the way.  The author brings London and its less glamorous side vividly to life.  The themes--corporate corruption and greed and the individuals victimized by them--are hardly new, but neither are they tiresome.  I enjoyed the author's novel, Restless, a bit more, but felt I had wasted neither time or money reading this one.
006107327X|3.0|This book is alright but it wasn't quite what I was expecting, so far I've only read about 75% of it and it does have a few notable flaws. There are loads of pictures which is great! but it seems a bit short on written info for its size and some of its content is little more than character descriptions with a few little titbits thrown in so if you've already watched the series and are already familiar with its characters some pages will seem a little pointless. Do not make the mistake of thinking this is a comprehensive \\"making of\\" book it collects a number of turnarounds, character art, and storyboards with some interesting facts but it reads more like an artbook with commentary more than anything. As far as design is concerned I was quite disappointed: there are whole pages dedicated to a single Image of a toy that in turn is mostly obscured by darkness and it's not uncommon for text to be lost in samples of background art or just made difficult to read for one reason or another, it also contains pages that fold out to A3 where an extra page would have worked just as well and the cover on my copy \\"slipped\\" out of place quite easily without any amount of rough handling at all.
B001DF68MA|5.0|I was a little hesitant to buy this after seeing some of the reviews saying that it is uncomfortable to ride with.  I disagree.  You're not going to do the tour de'france with this seat on your bike, but for short jaunts around town it should be fine.  It does take a little getting used to as you will have to bend your knees outward, but not overly much.  I have ridden up to ten miles with this thing attached and not felt uncomfortable after getting off.  For your comparison I am 6 feet tall and have long legs for my height.    Additionally it didn't really slow me down much.  I normally average about 15 mph during a trip on my bike, with this on I slowed down to about 12 mph.  My son absolutely loves it, we have ridden for up to 2 hours off and on and he never even falls asleep.      Only major downside, it's small.  Don't expect it to last as long as they advertise because your child will outgrow it quickly.  I estimate no more than 3 years old will be comfortable, and that may be pushing it.    Overall I would definitely recommend this seat.
B000V86OKG|5.0|This Season was exhilarating and suspenseful.  Dexter finds himself in a bind and you never know what will happen next!  This is arguably the best season so far.
B000AYEL1A|5.0|I've been looking for this film for years and finally found it on Amazon! It's just as good as the first time I saw it when it was released way back in the 70's. It's a great movie with brilliant performances from Barbra Streisand and Kris Kristofferson. Highly recommended!
B003EV6DBW|5.0|It's interesting how this show has managed to keep itself fresh and invigorated through 40+ year run(s).    From Hartnell to Tennant, it has always exhibited an ability to recreate itself and stand apart from what has come before without straying too far away from the familiar. For better or worse, Doctor Who has always found a way to carry on and each new iteration of The Doctor feels unique from those that came before, while still remaining that same lovable character that so many people from so many generations have grown up watching.    Now, even though my first experience with this show was back with Christopher Eccleston's 9th Doctor, I've gone as far back as I have been able to in order to immerse myself completely into the rich history of this show. I particularly love Patrick Troughton's cosmic hobo, Tom Baker's madcap spaceman and Peter Davison's adventurous cricketeer, though each of the performers that gave life to the character at one time or another have garnered my interest with their stories and their individual takes on such a fantastic and wildly imaginative character.    So, as I saw the Series 5 premiere earlier this year, I was ready to see what new twists and turns the show was going to take now. I had loved a great a deal of David Tennant's era but I found that most of the stories were very uneven. Tennant had been a great Doctor, but the material rarely matched his intensity, unless Steven Moffat or Paul Cornell happened to be penning the story. And, truth be told, that last year of Specials only truly produced one great story, which was this year's Hugo Award winning The Waters of Mars. Everything else felt like so much fluff. Like they were padding the year with these stories as they built to one last hurrah for Tennant's Ten.    Sadly, it never came.    I found The End of Time to be incredibly disappointing, with The Master's overall plot being borderline ludicrous and the resolution at the end to be highly anti-climactic. Aside from Bernard Cribbins, the Café scene in Part 1 and the last 20 minutes or so of Part 2, there wasn't anything that I liked about the episode. Poor Tennant was handed subpar material and, in the end, his Doctor went out a sad, angry, barely likable shadow of his former selves (which I maintain was contrary to what he was all the way through near the end of Series 4).    So, as I geared up for Series 5, I looked at what we had: new Doctor (Matt Smith), new Companion (Karen Gillan), new Showrunner (Steven Moffat), new TARDIS, new Screwdriver and an overall different tone to the previous two years. And I couldn't wait.    A lot of people have complained that the show hasn't changed much since Moffat took charge. I disagree. Completely.    For instance, whereas Tennant's Doctor became an egotistical mess as the seasons went along (to the point where he became a God, of sorts), Matt Smith's more chaotic rendition of the Time Lord is far more palatable: he can be funny, and I do mean hilarious (as exemplified in The Lodger), scary, powerful and kind at the drop of a hat. His Doctor reminds me of the better traits of late Hartnell (since his early Doctor was even more egotistical than Ten), Troughton, Pertwee and Baker.    He's the good wizard in stories that will always find a way to save us from evil. The magician that will surprise and entertain you in ways you didn't think possible. He's not completely infallible and, on occasion, he might not win every battle but he'll always do his best, because he can. The madman with the bowtie. In his time-traveling box.    Matt Smith's performance is completely electrifying and I can't help but watch in awe as this youngest incarnation of the centuries-old Time Lord, happens to be the best I've seen since the days of Peter Davison, seemingly having a blast with this role.    The same can be said for new Companion, Karen Gillan. As Amy she's every bit the early Rose Tyler and Ace: smart, quick-witted, strong-willed and fun. Her onscreen chemistry with Matt is a joy to watch. Even more so when Arthur Darvill joins them later on as Rory.    Now, that's all well and good. The cast is an incredibly huge part of the Series' success but equally as important, if not more so, is the hand of Steven Moffat running the show from behind the scenes. As writer of most of my favorite Nu-Who episodes during the days of RTD, I had even bigger expectations on what he could achieve as Showrunner.    And, unsurprisingly, he did a terrific job. The opening Post-Regeneration episode, The Eleventh Hour, is the best I've seen since Robot way back in 1974 (sure, Castrovalva was good, but nothing beats Tom Baker in a Viking get-up). The Beast Below was equal parts emotional and zany. The subsequent two-parter, The Time of Angels and Flesh and Stone, not only brought back two of Moffat's best creations, but also added a whole new sea of layers to them. It was a fun, alternately scary, fast-paced thriller that never let up. I hadn't felt that anxiety in Doctor Who since Blink (wink-wink, nudge-nudge).    And then there's the finale: The Pandorica Opens and The Big Bang. Without getting into the specifics of the story, I found that the people that were complaining about it, mostly do so because they feel it negated the events of the season, when it couldn't be more wrong. Sure, Amy brought back The Doctor and Rory, not to mention her parents, but that doesn't mean that whatever had happened before was negated. As Rory mentions, he does remember everything that happened. As does The Doctor, as well as River. For them, it happened and, after being played by whatever The Silence is, I think it's safe to bet that they're more than keen on finding out who or what exactly they are and why they gambled on The Doctor saving the Universe, because, knowing Moffat, I seriously doubt they were really after the destruction of the Universe. But, alas, those are answers to questions best left for Easter.    The finale itself was a grandiose affair with thrills, laughs and shocks. Not to mention a happy ending, of sorts, which has been long overdue in Nu-Who, cause it usually ends in tears. It was fun and highly quotable, and the sole reason why I would ever wear a fez, and that is saying a lot.    The rest of the episodes in the set are, for the most part, very good as well. Aside from Victory of the Daleks (which wasn't bad, just not as good either), The Vampires of Venice (which, actually, had a few good laughs throughout) and Cold Blood (which was simply disappointing after a terrific set-up in the first episode), everything else is gold.    Everything in Amy's Choice, Vincent and The Doctor and The Lodger is terrific (and it's especially true for the former).    So, all in all, you have 10 wonderful episodes, 1 dud and 2 okay episodes in a 13 episode TV season of a show that's, once more, getting off the ground with a brand-spanking new creative team at the helm. And, in the end, that's a truly great thing.    Long live The Doctor! May he survive past 13 incarnations!
0316098337|5.0|I have been a great fan of Emma Donoghue since \\"Slammerkin\\" and \\"The Woman Who Gave Birth To Rabbits\\". As soon as I saw her lastest work on Amazon, I had to own it! \\"Room\\" exhibits Donoghue's versatility and exquisite imagery. I loved Jack. The relationship between mother and child felt so real, I felt as if I were in \\"Room\\" too. The story twists and turns, keeping the reader guessing until the sweet ending. As Jack would say, \\"Another, please!\\"
B002N5N5M0|4.0|My girlfriend introduced me to Dexter, and I'm not complaining! Sure, Dexter's obsession is being a serial killer, but we all have obsessions.  Dexter does a great job of portraying a person and how they balance their life with their addictions.  I have seen every episode of Dexter and it is great.  The great writing and acting is evident. This show has a great cast and you immediately care about the characters.  Michael Hall and Jennifer Carpenter are great and they really hold their own in season four.  It is no wonder they are married in real life.  This season is a little disturbing than the other seasons, which I LOVE.  I am extremely anticipating what season five has to offer.  Let's hope season five is not the last.

0553277472|1.0|When I take an account of the things that were a complete waste of my time in this lifetime, this book will be in the top ten.    What a bunch of self-absorbed gibberish.  In the beginning, when there were some real references to motorcycle parts, I was actually interested, thought there might be some nice analogy and life lessons to be examined.   Nope.  Turned into one long megalomania rant.  I loathed this guy by the end of the book and wished I could have reported him to CPS for his lack of parental skills.   Hiking up a steep grade and NO WATER?   What a moron.   Maybe the incredibly poor nutrition may have been 90% of this guy's problems.       Presently, I live in a university town and the author reminds me of oh so many of the instructors who THINK they really have something to say...and everyone else KNOWS they don't.   And shame on every teacher who assigned this in a sorry attempt to stroke their own ego.    Don't waste your time with this book.
B000W91RUG|5.0|This is a funny show.  The characters are hilarious as well.  The dialogue can be a little complex with the physics/math references, but the plots are entertaining and keep you watching, such as Leonard's secret love for Penny, who lives across the hall.  I can't think of a TV show that is even remotely funny as this.
B001LF347E|5.0|Merlin is a wonderful show which the whole family will enjoy.  The cast was very well chosen as each seems the finest character capable of playing the part.  All are very well played and believable characters.  My family and I could hardly wait to watch each episode. All the episodes very well written and extremely well performed.  We can hardly wait for the second season.
B003V4AK8E|4.0|So I picked this controller up and honestly I'm impressed that this controller has beaten my past ps3 third party controllers and this is why.    Pros:    1) nice comfortable design  2) very responsive buttons  3) Buttons light up  4) Xbox 360 style analog stick placement  5) functional d-pad    Cons:    1) small dead zone but not as big as other third party controllers such as the shadow controller  2) Usb dongle which sucks as the connection is weaker and not stable.    Overall if they got rid of the dead zones they i would of given it 10 stars out of five but to put in a dead zone and a usb dongle thats just not right but still its a decent controller and in my opinion it is 95% worth it.
0553805371|3.0|The Hawking-Mlodinow multiverse explanation for the origin of the Universe in THE GRAND DESIGN is rational and plausible. It is, of course, not a very happy one for us humans since it is all a matter of purposeless and pointless processes. In my books, THE GOD THEORY and THE PURPOSE-GUIDED UNIVERSE: BELIEVING IN EINSTEIN, DARWIN AND GOD, I acknowledge the logic behind the multiverse concept, but elaborate on an equally logical interpretation based on a remark by astrophysicist Sir James Jeans that \\"the Universe begins to look more like a great thought than like a great machine.\\" There is a wealth of anecdotal evidence in the transcendent experiences countless people have had throughout history that a vast intelligence exists that at times can be directly experienced. Even Sir Arthur Eddington, the astrophysicist who proved that Einstein's space-time curvature was correct, wrote about realms beyond the physical in his SCIENCE AND THE UNSEEN WORLD. Interestingly such \\"spiritual\\" notions as other realms is consistent with the other dimensions of M-theory. The point is that the fine-tuning of our Universe could be simply the result of being part of a purposeless multiverse --  I acknowledge that -- or it could be the result of an intelligence whose purpose was a life-friendly Universe and whose thoughts were the cause of the Big Bang and the just right laws of nature. This has nothing to do with biblical creationism or intelligent design. In fact, Darwinian evolution would be an essential component in this interpretation of the origin of the Universe. The Dalai Lama wrote that when hard scientific evidence contradicts spiritual beliefs, science should win out. But it is equally fair to ask that science not reject out of hand the evidence from fine-tuning that the Universe may turn out to be more than an accident.

B003DT19F0|4.0|Just finished watching this little treasure. I swear, the Tinkerbell movies are a guilty pleasure for this college student. With this one I loved how they took a new direction with a certain \\"Queen B\\" Vidia. I really enjoyed her in this movie and warmed up to her character. She's one of the few fairies who tell it straight: Tink creates the mess and then get's praised for FIXING her own mess. Not that I don't like Tink but she's not my favorite character.     The only thing that bothered me with this movie was the ending. It was a rushed wrap-up. I feel they could have done a bit more with it because her father's sudden change of heart isn't really believable. Also, quite honestly, I was flabbergasted at how well the other fairies(not just the Tink group) just decided that it was OKAY to hang with the humans they had been preaching to stay away from. Maybe it's just my adult view. This adult view also sees that the cat was higher than a kite on a windy day. Loved it.     Oh and the lack of Terence was a bit disappointing. Yes, I have developed a small Disney crush. Leave me alone. ; )
B003MZ0I84|5.0|If you are a fan of Maroon 5 you will be happy to have this refreshing album to add to your collection.  They are still evolving, NOT stagnating. You tend to like each song within the first 30 seconds, and sway along with the melodies. Five Stars out of Five Stars.
B003V5PPZG|5.0|I'll make it short and sweet.  I sat down, cranked the stereo up and I had to remind myself to breathe.  This is a masterpiece.    It's rough at times, gentle for a few moments, a touch of punk and lots of rock and roll... perhaps some of it is yet to be defined.    LP is truly at the forefront with this one!
B003R4ZMNQ|5.0|Awesome rendition of the Hawaii Five-O franchise. Wonderfully faithful to the original story with its own unique flavor. Absolutely stunning visual effect and military-style action sequences that nail the Jack Lord vision. For those youngsters that did not grow up watching the Jack Lord episodes, Jack was dictatorily dogmatic in demanding top notch performances from the series' actors. This new show, albeit in its first season, has the potential to go the distance if the writers maintain the highest quality story lines that kept the interest of the original series for eleven seasons. Five stars, hands down. Well done to the production crew. Don't cut the production budget and keep the intro music as the authentic hallmark that it currently is. Kudos to the executive that rejected the first musical score and demanded the iconic Five-O theme music. Jack Lord would be proud. James MacArthur is proud. Oooooh-RAA.

B000006TRV|5.0|Words can't really say how much I love this album, but I will try anyway.<br /><br />I was 9 years old when this album came out in 1979.  I was only familiar with the single \\"Another Brick in the Wall, Part 2\\" at first, and I played the '45 until it cracked (literally).  I remember the radio playing the entire album late one night (beginning at midnight) and I stayed up until 1:30 in the morning just to listen to the whole thing.  Then, my older brother bought the 8 track tape.  As some of you who are familiar with 8 track tapes might remember, if you play the thing too many times, the sound begins to warp.  Well, I warped my brothers 8 track of \\"The Wall\\" pretty quickly.  At that point, I had to resort to going to my friends house to listen to the album (he had the vinyl copy).  I didn't get my own copy of \\"The Wall\\" on vinyl until my birthday in September of 1980.  Hey, I was just a 9 year old kid, I had no money to buy my own copy.<br /><br />I don't really know what it was about \\"The Wall\\" that made me love it so much.  Maybe it was all the cool artwork when you opened the record up (something you won't get if you buy the MP3 version).  Maybe it was the theatrical nature of the album (\\"The Trial\\" was one of the weirdest things I had ever heard).  My young ears were blown away.  To this day, I can still listen to \\"The Wall\\" and never get tired of it.<br /><br />There are numerous classics on this album.  \\"Another Brick in the Wall, Part 2,\\" \\"Mother,\\" \\"Goodbye Blue Sky,\\" \\"Young Lust,\\" \\"Hey You,\\" \\"Comfortably Numb,\\" and \\"Run Like Hell\\" are obvious ones.  For me, it was \\"Side 3\\" of the record that I loved the most.  Starting with \\"Hey You\\", a beautiful, haunting ballad sung by David Gilmour that builds to an emotional climax with Roger shouting \\"Don't tell me there's no hope at all!  Together we stand, divided we fall!\\"  Next up is \\"Is There Anybody Out There?\\" which has one of the most moving, somber acoustic guitar solo I have ever heard.  \\"Nobody Home\\", \\"Vera\\", and \\"Bring the Boys Back Home\\" all flow together beautifully, and you can feel real, deep emotion in Roger's vocals.  \\"Comfortably Numb\\" ended side 3 on the vinyl version, and this song is truly Floyd's masterpeice.  The guitar solo at the end ranks as one of the best ever, by any band.<br /><br />I'll be seeing Roger performing this album later this year.  I was too young in 1980 to catch Pink Floyd's performances of The Wall, but I knew people who did go, and I felt so jealous.  Now, 30 years later, I will finally get my chance.Home\\" all flow together beautifully, and you can feel real, deep emotion in Roger's vocals.  \\"Comfortably Numb\\" ended side 3 on the vinyl version, and this song is truly Floyd's masterpeice.

B0028RXXFC|5.0|I have been very pleased with the quality of the mini-series Rome. Although, I am sure some license of liberty has been exercised, I am very much pleased with the what appears to be the attention to detail. The clothing, the buildings,<br />the busy streets, the contrast between the rich and poor, the social structures (slaves, patricians) and how each one fits or behaves or dresses, the food and the lack of food, and the types (mice, eels) of food which were common<br />at that time (I also understand that hummingbird tongues were a delicacy), the water and sewage systems, public toilets, open nudity and dress, the town crier who was vocally and physically expressive. All of these and more left me<br />very much impressed with the all the behind the scenes work to bring this \\"epic\\" to Blu-Ray. My hats off to the casting director who seems to have done a splendid job in choosing the right actors/actresses to portray their respective<br />characters.

0765326353|5.0|I am an audiobook fan, and have listened through this book in it's entirety - at about 46 hours, it's a long book!  It took me a little time to get used to the world - plants, animals, the highstorms, etc.  At first I wasn't a fan of the jumping back and forth in time for Kaladin, but in the end I believe that was absolutely the right approach for his character - showing how he got where he was.  I found both the characters and the world to be well thought out.  I was bummed to get to the end of the book, and hope Brandon has inspiration to turn more books out quickly! I eagerly await the future volumes and will get them the day they are available.  And for those of you that don't know, the audiobook is narrated by both Michael Kramer and Kate Reading - the ones who have narrated the Robert Jordan 'Wheel of Time' series.  They are my favorite narrators, and do a stellar job at bringing a great book to life!  Write, Brandon, write! :-)
B002Q4TKAY|5.0|AMAZING.  I have been a Killers fan for years as well as introduced dozens of people to the Killers. Yet, I have never been to a concert. I did see Live at Royal Albert Hall in theaters (myself and 4 other people in the theater) =] We all sang. I now own it as well as the soundtrack and if you love the Killers, especially if you've never been to a concert, you need to buy it. It rocks.
B003NX6ZDC|4.0|This review includes \\"The Deluxe Edition\\" additional songs.<br /><br />The Killer's Brandon Flowers has always been one of those frontmen who seem to be specifically built for the limelight.  Often built so well that being backed by a band does not due because of the desire to express himself with his own creativity with his own fenceless boarders.  Flowers has accomplished that with \\"Flamingo,\\" his first solo effort.  The album is made up of The Killers styled ballads, but lacks the grand scale of some of the band's outings.  To put \\"Flamingo\\" in perspective with The Killer's own music...Flowers brings a lot more \\"Human\\" than he does \\"Somebody Told Me.\\"  Which might be a good thing or bad depending on why you enjoy The Killers music.  But it is safe to say that with Flowers, you will enjoy the album if you are a fan of The Killers, but if you are not a fan of the band, you probably will not be a fan of this music.<br /><br />Track to track ratings:<br /><br />1.) Welcome to Fabulous Las Vegas 3/5<br />This track is obviously an introduction to the album.  It seems like it introduces the concept of the album.  Being that Flowers and The Killers's hometown is Las Vegas, this is an ode to the city in some regards.  It comes off a little more of a commercial for the Strip than anything else, but is still a very listen-able track that does not need to be skipped.  However, after a couple of listens, many will.<br /><br />2.) Only the Young 4/5<br />\\"Only the Young\\" will come across to listener's immediately who enjoy some of The Killer's more \\"ballad-like\\" tracks.  It reminds me of \\"Human,\\" but lyrically sets it apart.  It is a very introspective account from Flowers that is touching in its tone and speed.  It is a track that will give the listener a clue as to what is to come throughout the album.  A great track.<br /><br />3.) Hard Enough 3/5<br />This track one that is another slow paced song which is backed by a female vocalist.  This gives it an almost duet like characteristic which will give the song a \\"folk-like\\" tone.  It reminds me of something that Bob Dylan would record in his early days.  This is one song that separates Brandon Flowers from any of The Killers creations.  A good track though.<br /><br />4.) Jilted Lovers & Heartbreaks 3/5<br />On this track Flowers brings his lead singer talents to the forefront with his energy and jilted lyrics.  Many of his songs have longer, but lyrically strong choruses.  This is one of them.  A good track.<br /><br />5.) Playing with Fire - 5/5<br />The introduction to this track is slowly brought in by instruments which give it a very mellow beginning.  It sets the mood perfectly.  Flowers steps up and gives the song a very emotional flare with is lyrics and tone.  One of strongest \\"emotional\\" tracks on the album.  The chorus is excellent and it does a great job at making the song enjoyable to listen to and not such a \\"downer.\\"<br /><br />6.) Was It Something I Said 5/5<br />This is the first track that will remind listeners immediately of The Killers.  It is upbeat and strong.  Lyrically, Flowers once again brings his talents.  It is a feel good track of sorts.  Including the song at this point of the album is a great transition from the more mellow tracks before it.  An excellent song.<br /><br />7.) Magdelena 4/5<br />Another track that feeds off the song before it.  The energy is there and it will once again remind listeners of a song that could have easily been included on a past Killers album.<br /><br />8.) Crossfire 5/5<br />\\"Crossfire\\" has always given me the same feeling as \\"Human\\" did when it was first debuted.  And with \\"Crossfire\\" once again, I love it.  One of the best tracks on the ablum, no doubt.  Lyrically it is as strong as any song created by Flowers (or the Killers) in my opinion.  The chorus and the bridge is one of the best I have heard in recent years.  The obvious first single off the album.<br /><br />9.) On the Floor 4/5<br />This song calms the energy from the three tracks before it.  It is another track that brings an emotional tone that is mixed with mellow instruments and slow spoken words.  It's a mellow track on a large scale.  Towards the end of the song Flowers is backed by a choir which gives the song a different feel at the end as it did from the beginning.  A great track.<br /><br />10.) Swallow It 4/5<br />Lyrically, many can decipher the words and speculate on what Flowers had in mind as far as symbolizing the phrase \\"Swallow It.\\"  But with that regard, the song itself is a solid outing.  It is interesting that he would close the album out with this track, but maybe he wanted to end with a potential single.  Because this could be.<br /><br />DELUXE BONUS SONGS<br />11.) The Clock Was Tickin' 3/5<br />If other songs on the album reminded me of something Bob Dylan would have recorded than this track is a spot on Dylan influenced track.  It has an almost \\"twangy\\" instrumental backing it and the lyrics provide a story straight out of any southern town (but not limited to).  Halfway into it, it transforms into a more traditional Flower's track; which seems to bring it back full circle.<br /><br />12.) Jacksonville 5/5<br />This is my favorite track of the DELUXE edition and one of the my favorites in general.  It has an eclectic feel with a grand chorus that is enjoyable to listen to.  It feels like an inspiration from The Killers debut album \\"Hot Fuss.\\"  It can be a single worthy song, which is confusing to think they would only include it in the deluxe edition.<br /><br />13.) I Came to Get Over You 3/5<br />Some of these songs, as i've said before, will remind you of The Killers more than others and this is one that will once again have you saying, \\"this could have been on any of the Killers albums.\\"  But it wasn't and seems more like a song that would have been included on the \\"Sawdust\\" album (which was a collection of cuts that never made it to any of the official Killer ablbums).  That was a decent album and this is a decent song.<br /><br />14.) Right Behind You 5/5<br />One of my favorite tracks on the ENTIRE album, and once again, it is strange that this one is only included in the DELUXE edition.  It's energy and tone give it an all around grand scale.  The chorus is infectious and will have you singing (even silently) along with it.  The instrumentals set it apart from any other track on the album.  With this track and \\"Jacksonville,\\" the DELUXE edition of the album is more than worth it.<br /><br />All in all, Flowers gives what is expected of him.  As with any album, give it multiple listens to fully grasp its range and impact.  This is easily one of the best Rock Pop albums put out this year.  If you are a fan of The Killers, it is another must have.  But even if you are not, listen to the singles at least.mellow instruments and slow spoken words.  It's a mellow track on a large scale.

B000001Y79|1.0|I hate Gwen's yelling, screeching vocals and all the songs accept for \\"Don't Speak.\\"  The dance/pop band Clueless does a decent cover of \\"Spiderwebs,\\" but it just sounds like a lot of noise by No doubt.
0525478183|5.0|I am a long time watcher of Hank and John Green's Youtube channel \\"Vlogbrothers\\" though I am a first time reader of John's books. This is definitely a good first. Reading it I could hear John's voice and loved the storyline. It's about Quintin \\"Q\\" Jacobsen's long time love for a girl for his neighbor Margo Roth Spiegalman- he helps her on a secret ninja mission only to have her vanish the next morning; but not without leaving \\"Q\\" detailed clues leading to her whereabouts. Q intends on finding Margo and returning her safe and sound all before Prom.  When I was reading it I was excited and trying to figure out Margo's clues along with Q, when I wasn't reading it was all I could think about and when I turned the last page I opened it again. I could read it again and again. The next one on my list is Looking For Alaska.

B003EYVY04|1.0|First of all, the lack of an extended cut takes away any chance of this item being a worthwhile purchase. Now the movie itself also has many flaws. Besides a terrible artistic style, and omitting many important scenes it also suffers from terrible dialogue pacing. Too many conversations happen at a Gilmoresque pace that shouldn't. Harry Potter is not a quick thinking character outside of physical conflict. If he is being told important, complex information he needs to stand there and absorb the information for a moment before responding. This same issue happens on a much lesser scale to most characters in the movie. The only characters who benefit from this pace are the Weasley Twins. The silver tongued quick witted bamboozlers work very well with the pacing of this movie.
B003TML0VO|3.0|While this collection of songs is listenable, I prefer the Santana of old. In preview trailers for this CD, Carlos made a point of saying that the entire Santana band had input and participation in this project. The Latin percussion, which contributes so much to the Santana sound, only appears sporadically. And the rest of the band, all competent musicians, never have a chance to shine.     The guest artist approach worked with Supernatural and, to a lesser extent, Shaman but by the time All That I Am was released it was wearing thin. I'm sure this CD, which follows the Clive Davis guest artist formula, will sell reasonably well and bring in the dinero, but I'm fervently hoping that Carlos isn't following the Rod Stewart, Great American Songbook road and is planning to release five editions of Guitar Heaven. If he does, I'll spend my limited CD budget on lesser known but more deserving groups like The Iguanas, Los Lobos and Alejandro Escovedo.     Sorry Carlos, you're my all-time favorite guitarist, but unless you've lost your mojo and are content to simply play your (and now others) hits in Vegas, I'll have to pass on GH2. Let's hope you find the fire again on your next release.
B00008OLYN|5.0|This is a masterpiece by the masters of progressive Scandinavian metal.  Steven Wilson does a great job producing the guitars and vocals.  Opeth once again shows us their great versatility.  Might not be a favorite of fans who like Opeth only because they are heavy, but Opeth can do it all.  This album is beautiful!
B0038M2AZA|5.0|I viewed this HBO movie with my wife, a speech and language therapist,who has read Dr. Grandin's books and has worked with children in school settings who have aspects of autism. We thoroughly enjoyed the acting of all in the production, but we especially appreciated Temple Grandin's commentary along with the director's and writer's as we watched the movie a second time. Seeing the movie again as she described the scenes, what lead to her behavior, comments as she watched Ms. Danes portray her was truly an insight into Temple Grandin and what an extraordinary person she is. Two nights ago we were fortunate to hear Dr. Grandin lecture a standing room crowd of over 500 people at Colorado State University on her visual learning, on animal behavior and ,basically, on her view of her work and life. The movie is an extraordinary introduction into a life well-lived then and now.
B003TML0VO|3.0|Fans eagerly awaiting this artist's interpretation of classic guitar rock compositions will not be disappointed. All the Santana production values are present. Excellent musicianship from Carlos and company, including a stellar array of contemporary vocalists.  This project is just a slight recalibration of the same music /business model from Santana's last three CD releases starting with 1999's \\"Supernatural \\". Frankly, the format is getting a little stale around the edges. However, who can argue with wide spread commercial success. The past three discs have generated millions in sales and helped fund very successful revenue generating concert tours. Let's not also forget the nine Grammy awards achieved by \\"Supernatural \\"alone.  Clive Davis is the master architect responsible for designing and constructing Santana's global success in the 21st century. It's the same formula, more or less, he applied to Rod Stewart's successful \\"Great American Songbook\\" series. In Fact, Rod is poised to release volume V on Oct. 19. Also, as an aside, Eric Clapton is preparing to release his CD version on American standards next week. I can't wait!  Who can blame Santana, Rod or Eric for pursuing the well worn musical path given the current dismal state of the music industry.  It's nothing more then a somewhat noble attempt to keep their careers alive and relevant.  Personally, I just don't understand reworking these classics. I'd much rather hear the original artists reinterpret their own work. In fact, a lot of that material already exists.   Try \\"Whole Lotta Love \\" by Jimmy Page and the Black Crowes (Live At The Greek CD). How about the reinterpretations of  \\"Sunshine of your Love \\" by Cream( studio and live reunion CDs) as well as solo versions by Eric Clapton as well as Jack Bruce. The list of original artists rearranging and deconstructing their work goes on and on.  If only Carlos had chosen the bold musical step of  producing a CD exploring the rearrangement  of some of his original work.  I wish Santana much commercial success with this current project. Success will surely fuel major future concert tours. It's this venue that one can truly experience the essence and musical rewards of Santana.  Till then, I'm satisfied to continue exploring 40 years of back catalogue. Even with constant listening there still surfaces rewarding musical surprises.
B003A4IFDW|5.0|This cd by Bettye LaVette is a gem.  Her choices of material are wonderful;  something for everyone.  Her voice is beautiful and her styling is relaxed and \\"swinging\\".  Not overstylized, but she knows how to reach out and \\"kick it\\" for her listeners.
0312600844|5.0|I absolutely loved this book.  I loved the time that Mr. Franzen took to develop his characters.  This is not a book for those looking for a fast read and/or lots of action.  However, if you're looking for a book that really delves into what motivates people and examines consequences of one's actions over the course of one's life, then this book won't disappoint.  The premise of this book is not that Freedom is bad, as some reviewers have stated.  Instead, I think the book invites one to examine the consequences of fighting for and winning one's freedom in many difference scenarios - some turn out well, and some not so well.  But overall, I loved this book's positive message that it's never too late to go back and correct mistakes.  I can't say enough good things about this book.
B000002MIF|5.0|Hatful of Hollow is not a studio release by The Smiths, but it may as well be. This album is arguably just as popular and well-known as any of the four studio releases by the band and the album stands on it's own as a great album.     While many of the tracks have been released in previous forms (such as on singles and things of that nature), the tracks that appear here that don't appear on the four studio releases or Louder Than Bombs are What Difference Does It Make?, These Things Take Time, This Charming Man, Handsome Devil, Still Ill, You've Got Everything Now, Accept Yourself, Back to the Old House, and Reel Around the Fountain.    Every song on this album is pure-gold and, even if you own all the studio releases and [[ASIN:B000002LBH Louder Than Bombs]], this is an album that's definitely worth getting. The Smiths are my favorite band and before listening to this album I was already very familiar with all the tracks on here in their previous form, so many of the tracks on here don't sound quite as good as the versions I'm used to (These Things Take Time comes to mind instantly)...But many of them rival the other versions or at least are equal to them.    This album does feature \\"Handsome Devil\\" and \\"Accept Yourself,\\" the former a brilliantly cheeky song, the latter a criminally underrated Smiths classic with amazing lyrics.    While few things on here are technically \\"new,\\" this album is very much a classic example of The Smiths and if you're a fan of the band you'll find much to love here.    GRADE: A
B003R0LBVW|5.0|My friends love Freedom but I think for the price is too high. Dealing with cost analysis I know digital is the way to go to keep green these days but the publisher will profit more if they bring the price down to $9.99. If you get the digital you might as well get the physical. It is a great book and it made us name our new book similar to it which is also a great story. [[ASIN:B004477Z0I Freedom Melody]] Them lowering the price will possibly put it at #1 on amazon's top sellers list for a month or so since the book is so good.<br /><br />Publishing Team<br />Steviesha T.

030726999X|5.0|The best of the trilogy, this author is so refreshing with the complex plot, the extremely well developed characters. Too bad he passed away. I find it interesting that some of the best films and books in demand and sold in America now originate or use actors and characters in and from foreign countries. Our nation may have been getting hardening of the artistic arteries to go along with extremist, backward looking, fixed mindset politics.  So this trilogy and this last book, in terms of demand and quality, is a good sign.
B002VKE1K2|4.0|Seems that today's generation can't appreciate a good old-fashioned style jump-out-your-seat horror film if there's no slash & gore involved as I've seen this movie torn to pieces over on IMDB, enough to make a bad Shymalan review seem glowing by comparison.  But this is a pretty creepy movie regardless of those negative reviews and the Blair Witch-type-\\"filmed on a camcorder\\" faux reality approach to the production. In fact, that production style works better with this film than it did in Blair Witch (which I think is very much over-rated).  Who hasn't at some point in their life felt frightened lying in bed at night and hearing a noise in another room in the house, especially if that noise is coming from downstairs?  This movie excels at exploring that fear and the \\"reality\\"-camcorder style really brings that fear into better focus - it gave me the willies especially in the last 20 minutes or so.  Seeing this movie on DVD and not in the theater I can only imagine how much more scary it would have been on the big screen. I'm looking forward to the sequel.
1439181780|3.0|I loved The Secret so I was very excited to see a sequel. Unfortunately this book just annoyed me. Each page says the same thing! Byrne says over and over that if you are positive then you can't feel negative. This is such an udealistic, Pollyanna way of viewing life. When you feel negative about something it is a warning sign. You need to address what it means not just ignore the feelings and think happy thoughts about what you do want.     Also giving love is far more than thoughts and feelings. I wish Bryne had talked less about what you think and feel (rehashed from The Secret) and made it more practical. Give love by giving money to charity, helping someone in need, or being there for someone. Those are true acts of love. Just sending out thoughts and feelings of love isn't enough. I once attended a church that always said, \\"It's good to pray for the hungry, but it's even better to actually feed them.\\"    What annoyed me the most was what Byrne had to say about relationships. Just give love and your relationship will be everything you want it to be. Nowhere does she talk about how if you are getting abused or mistreated in any way that you should get out of the relationship. And that if you are being mistreated that is NOT love. I felt like she was saying just think happy thoughts and he'll stop beating you.    The part about how Byrne says the only person in the universe that matters is you was written very badly. I know what she was trying to say. That all of us in the world are one. When you want something you need to treat others as you would yourself, but unfortunately the way Byrne worded this section made it sound completely selfish and egotistical.     In fact, the whole book came off as selfish and egotistical. What can the universe give me, me, me? I am sending out love so I should be entitled to whatever I want! I am a magnet of love! Yet what are you DOING for others? I can sit on my couch giving love and imagining my ideal husband, but unless I getoff the couch I'm probably not going to find him. Byrne is trying to convince me that he's going to come knocking at my door just by thinking happy thoughts. The money, career, house, and car I want are just going to appear because I'm so full of love not because I actually worked hard in life while thinking positive thoughts!    One part that I did like which I wish had been expanded was where Byrne talks about loving people that have what you want. When you see someone that has what you want the universe is presenting it to you. Instead of feeling jealous give that person love. However, Bryne never actually addresses being jealous. God forbid she should mention a feeling in the book that isn't positive! But I really liked the idea that by showing that person love instead of jealousy and spite the universe is more likely to reward you with what you desire.    I also liked the quotes by other New Thought Authors. However it was sad that the quotes got the point across in one or two sentences while Byrne was trying to make the same point using three or more pages and still failed. The quotes were always very practical unlike Byrne's prose which is so full of saccharin I still have a toothache.
B001AQO3Z6|5.0|This film should have been one of the first to receive a Bluray release - the amazing Baraka has already but we need Koyaanisqatsi - please hurry this along and if possible, make a damn good job of cleaning up the original negatives, the way Criterion would if they were given the license!    Thank you.
B0031RAOVY|5.0|Hachi is a beautifully done tale of the loyalty of a dog. Adapted from a real life happening in Japan in the early part of the last century it has echos of Greyfriars Bobby a similar demonstration of canine devotion famous in Edinburgh, Scotland a century earlier.  All the more poignant because it is adapted from a true story and set in contemporary America. Well directed and acted by normally 'big buck' actors this is a heartwarming tale. Most people end up crying at it's humanity (doggonity?) and loving it.

067182449X|5.0|This book gives a glimpse into the life of a girl who is isolated from her fun life as a popular and lively adolescent and forced to live in fear and hiding for more than 2 years.  Although few of us will ever experience the horror of hiding in a house during a war with the fear of death looming constantly, many of us can relate to the consequences of isolation, and the relationship dynamics that emerge when fear abounds.  The book also speaks to the creativity and resiliency of the human spirit and proves that even in the worst of circumstances there is still a chance to find bits of joy and to experience love.
0061122416|5.0|'The Alchemist', although written in a simple language, spoke to the core of my soul. I loved the simplicity of the writing, the way the elements were used to portray the struggles and searches of each and everyone's journey here on earth, and how Paulo incorporated spirituality. The innocence of the Sheppard searching, and journeying to find the Alchemist was/is inspiring! I related to the Sheppard in my life, and saw it as a parable for what we are all doing here.

B002PEP4SC|4.0|Richard Castle is a fictional writer of crime fiction, one half (the literary half) of the sleuthing team of Becket and Castle on ABC TV's comedy-drama police procedural [[ASIN:B001XRLWPQ Castle]]. Castle is the \\"real life\\" author of these books. Who actually writes them is thus far a bigger mystery than a season's worth of CASTLE scripts.<br /><br />While lots of movies get book tie-ins, this is the first time a TV character has spawned a book series. (Disclaimer: BONES' Temperance Brennan was invented by author Kathy Reichs, and on the TV show Brennan writes novels in which Kathy Reichs is the heroine, but the BONES books inspired the show, not the other way around as with CASTLE.)<br /><br />You don't need to be a CASTLE fan to enjoy HEAT WAVE (though it doesn't hurt). Nikki Heat is the sexy, no-nonsense cop. Jameson Rook is her wisecracking sidekick.<br /><br />In HEAT WAVE they are investigating the murder of a New York real estate tycoon who fell on both hard times and the pavement of Central Park West (from the sixth floor of his apartment building). The story stands on its own as a good, light quick murder mystery, leavened with humor.<br /><br />The in-joke of Richard Castle having written the book (and having based the suave, attractive, intelligent and heroic Rook on himself) keeps bursting through the fourth wall to add a unique and entertaining dimension to HEAT WAVE. If you've never seen CASTLE, you will watch it after reading HEAT WAVE. And if you weren't aware that Castle's HEAT WAVE is a real book, then be in for a pleasant surprise.<br /><br />Personally, I can't wait for NAKED HEAT to be released!

B003XJDT1W|5.0|Please don't tell these guys how much I like their music, or what a bargain I consider this album (even with buying the Deluxe edition via their fan-club, along with a bunch of other really nice items including the cookbook).  If the record companies learn these facts, they may come back and demand more compensation for the number of times I'm going to be playing these songs ;)  Truthfully, I'd been waiting impatiently for this album from the moment it was announced, frustrated all the more as I got to hear a few of the tunes that were released early getting some radio air play.  While it was nice hearing those tunes, knowing those were just the tip of the iceberg left me wanting to hear the rest of the album all that much more.  Now that it's here, I'm as happy as a pig in slop (to use some ZBB/Southern Ground type terminology).<br /><br />I've had the pleasure of seeing Zac Brown Band live and in person twice so far, and I must say I can see myself catching them again many more times if given the chance to do so.  They just deliver when it comes to entertainment value, and this collection is just the latest demonstration of that fact.<br /><br />I could ramble on about each individual song in this collection but the music speaks for itself.  If you must, play some of the samples and let the tracks pull you in, though it would seem to make more sense to just order your own copy so you can get on with listening to this one yourself.  I might be able to offer up some favorite tracks later, but picking any one song from this collection as a favorite would be an injustice to rest of the fine tracks that are included here.

It's not sleepy like Gwyneth Paltrow's (not to mention having to deal with her horrible fake accent), or lacking chemistry and leaving you wanting more like Kate Beckinsale's.  Johnny Lee Miller plays a fantastic Mr. Knightley as well.  I love Jane Austen, and this is definitely one of my favorite adaptations thus far.
B0027HOBM2|5.0|Pros:  This show is excellent overall.  The dialogue is written thoughtfully, as in a good novel.  A given tidbit of information is sometimes dropped in, left alone, and later on the audience is surprised with a fully developed plot.  The writers are very good.      Cons:  Careful with children.  This is highly adult material.  If you have not watched Season 1, it could be hard to pick up on the story line.  Buy Season 1 first.
0441013597|4.0|Great book, read it when I was a teenager, about 40 years ago!  However, I would not recommend reading the commentary first at the end of the book, by Herbert's son.  It sort of ruined the book for me.  If you're going to read it at all, wait until the end of the book.
B003ZHR6RK|5.0|We all know that this movie is ranked one of the best of all time, so I don't feel it is necessary to go on and on about how wonderful it is.  My only advice in regards to enjoying the plot/storyline/etc is to read the novella by Stephen King first.  This movie adapts the book flawlessly, while keeping almost everything in tact.  When direct quotes from the book were used in the film, I started tearing up every time.<br /><br />Now about the Blu Ray.  Though I have yet to see a BD release that hasn't added a goodly increase in picture and audio quality from a likewise DVD release, you occasionally run across some that don't really improve that much.  With Shawshank, however, the improvement isn't just obvious, but an in-your-face smack of clarity that will even make the snobbiest blu ray fan's jaw drop open.<br /><br />From here I could go on to say how rich the blacks are and how warm the red tones look, but to be honest there aren't enough adjectives to properly describe the perfection of the quality.  \\"Perfect\\" is, I guess, the only one that comes closest.  This release shows exactly how the movie was meant to be seen.  It shows details and colors the way the director wanted them to be shown, it enhances movement, and blasts with glorious uncompressed audio.  It is, ultimately, a new release in that no one has been able to watch this movie at home with this much clarity ever before.  I cannot recommend it enough.<br /><br />Overall, this is a fantastic movie and a top notch blu ray release.  If you've never seen The Shawshank Redemption before, you owe it to yourself to witness a film masterpiece - but, I add, if you have never seen it before, you also owe it to yourself to read what is easily a masterpiece in the literary world as well.  Stephen King's short novella is more than worth reading, and at only a 100 pages you could probably read it in less time than it would take to watch the movie.<br /><br />And, of course, if you've seen it before, are a fan, or even if you already own a DVD copy, let me assure you that it is worth reliving all over again thanks to Blu Ray.opy, let me assure you that it is worth reliving all over again thanks to Blu Ray.
B002BGFUPQ|5.0|The movie is excelent and the BD experience you can enjoy it to the limit with this one. Totally recommended
1439181780|5.0|Such an incredible book. I read from it all the time and each time I do I feel inspired and empowered to create the life of my dreams. I would recommend it to anyone.
B002KKCVQO|4.0|Bought this pair for my husband and he has enjoyed them very much. Good arch support and comfortable ensole. The backstrap caused some irritation until he was use to the sandal, but overall he is very pleased with this sandal. In fact I am going to order some for myself.
0140186409|5.0|The only thing I can say about the purchase that was somewhat negative, was  not realizing that the year of print was different from the copy we had taken out from the library.  We decided to buy, since the book was due and had not been read through.  All the notes taken on particular pages had to be searched for in the new book since the pages were different.  A lesson learned!
B0043CO7WI|5.0|hearing this for the first time still made me wanna get out of my seat and just shake it up! they're still keeping it up from the top of the pop rock genre.
B0041ZQHHA|5.0|I tried to abandon all expectations or preconceived notions I had about Flowers or the Killers. After my first listen I was intrigued, but not totally convinced. By the 4th listen I really loved the album. Flowers lyrics and song-writing are clever, interesting, and even deep and reflective in parts (aka \\"the fountain of youth has been reduced to a drip\\"). It's not the Killers. In fact it's more alt-country than anything the Killers have done. I was surprised how much this song focused on Las Vegas. This albums takes you to Vegas, walks you down the strip and keeps you there. It doesn't have the mass appeal, and I'm kind of glad. If it were too successful, he might not go back to the Killers and that'd be a shame.
0920668364|5.0|This book will bring tears to the eye of parents or grandparents when reading it to children.  It is definitely timeless and I read it to my grandchildren when they were young and are now in college and just purchased it for friends who are having their first great-grandchildren
0199537151|3.0|so yeah this is the ugliest/ creepiest version of frankenstein's monster i've ever seen on the cover of a book. but the plus is it's the 1818 text (the first edition, more \\"raw\\") if you need to read that version. if not, i'd opt for another version (the one from the 1830s) because the cover really bothers me- i had to put a post-it over the face
B003PIUC02|5.0|The Spartacus story is probably very well known to everyone but none had ever produced this level excitement and quality like this production. This show probably depicted very close to what Rome and the Romans were like with respect to blood and sex (it means a lot and lot of them).  The actings, custom, and details are top-notch. Looking forward for season 2 and more.
0545265355|4.0|so i was expecting a fancy box for my box set, but instead pretty much paid $4 for a cheap printed cardboard box( it's like those ones that hold stuff from costco)- it looks okish... i'm not complaining though it keeps the books together, and the books are AMAZING anyway. but if you don't really want a box, just buy the books separately- it'll be cheaper. YAY HUNGER GAMES!!!!
B00005R2IS|5.0|Mel Gibson has made a career of playing Angry Mel--an initially decent man who, having suddenly and violently lost what he holds most dear, gets royally pissed and goes on a vicious, vengeful rampage--in movies from Lethal Weapon to Payback to The Patriot to Braveheart, but it all started with this one.    Mad Max takes place in a dystopic future. Not the postapocalyptic wasteland of the later Mad Max movies, but a decaying, semiliterate society frighteningly close to our own. In this time motorcycle gangs, led by the sadistic, maniacal Toecutter, have taken over the roads of Australia, and the government (or what passes for the government) can barely manage to keep things just shy of anarchy.     Only the Main Force Patrol (MFP), the police force, stands in the way of the gangs. However, they aren't much better, for in their mad pursuit of their quarry, they tend to leave a trail of civilian casualties in their wake, and they seem far more concerned with the thrill of the chase than maintaining the peace.    In this world the only things that matter are speed and quick reflexes. Whoever has those rules the roads. Those who have neither, on the other hand, usually end up as flaming wrecks on the side of the highway.    Into this state of affairs enters Gibson as Max Rockatansky, the top Interceptor on the MFP, who, with his fun-loving partner Goose, daily takes to the roads to pursue the Toecutter's gang. He seems to be a more decent sort than his fellow officers, hence more sensitive to the endless parade of horrors he sees on the job, but manages to hang on to his sanity thanks to his loving wife and young son. Of course this happy (?) situation can't last, otherwise we wouldn't have a movie...and you can guess what happens next.    There are so many things to love about this movie: the brutal, suspenseful car chases (done on a shoestring budget and, even so, more inventive than what you'll see in most Hollywood action movies), the bizarre slangy, gabbly Aussie futurespeak, the crazed gangsters with their scruffy, outlandish punk costumes, and the garish, Wild-West-through-a-funhouse-mirror universe it all takes place in. As for Mel Gibson: if you ever harbored doubts the man could act, this movie should put them to rest forever, because he turns in a superb, fully-rounded performance here. But don't worry, for those who crave Angry Mel, he shows up too.     Highly recommended.
B001DE29SS|5.0|Great movie, it's real cool seeing how the movies were made back then and how hard it is on the family when you're in this business. Great movie overall.
0553805371|4.0|I enjoyed the book a lot.    This was my frist book on Physics and now that I have read this it most certainly won't be my last!
B0019N8P2W|5.0|It really takes me back to watch all these episodes, though I can definitely appreciate them more now being older. All the bonus material, really gives it more bang for your buck, great buy.
0226264211|4.0|Though the text is nearly 50 years old, the author makes valid points. The author describes how political action can effect economics and vice versa. Even back then, the author was displeased with social security on economic grounds.
B003P2WO5E|4.0|***NO SPOILERS***<br /><br />The Way of Kings was an outstanding novel and a great introduction to an intricately crafted world. The story was terrific, the pacing excellent. Even the interludes (which I normally hate in a book) were timed right and added to the story without bogging it down.<br /><br />I cruised through this 1000 page novel actually wanting more to read. As I neared the end I began to realize that I would miss this world and these characters until the release of the next volume.<br /><br />I do have a couple points of contention (which is why no 5 star review).<br /><br />1. Too often Sanderson would incorporate comedy by means of twisted grammar. An example was a joke about insult and \\"in slut\\". While this might read well it tends to ruin immersion and makes the reader focus on the author as if he is nodding and winking at you, \\"see what I did there?\\".<br /><br />2. A character in the story (Wit)told the main character (Kalidan) to do something which seemed pretty important. The issue was never addressed again and it was almost as if Sanderson forgot to include the resolution of that conversation. In a novel this dense I can understand how it may have turned up missing but it was a nagging issue that I couldn't fully get over.<br /><br />All in all amazing book that marks the rise of the new Epic Fantasy master. Bravo Brandon!
0739499963|5.0|Love this book so far, nearly done with it! I just love the way Nicholas Sparks writes!  Accidently bought this book in large print, but not a big deal!
B001UV4XFG|3.0|To be clear from the beginning: I am not a Twilighter or Twi-hard or any of the those other monikers applied to obsessive fans of the series. Also, I found the first movie to be subpar in terms of storytelling, yet better than New Moon in terms of action. (Don't get me wrong, I liked watching Edward get his ass handed to him by Felix as much as the next guy, but a few minutes of vamp smackdown does not a good action sequence make.)    Let us also establish that I have been a member of Team Jacob from the beginning. Why? I believe that the underdog (no pun intended) should have a fair chance at love without having to compete with some pretty boy that can give a woman eternal youth and vitality.    As to the Bella/Edward/Jacob love triangle as it applies to Eclipse, it boils down to Bella's desire to become a vampire, Edward's refusal to change her without fulfilling some derranged marriage fantasy, and Jacob's antagonistic views on anything concerning vampirism. Basically it's--    Bella: \\"Change me, Edward.\\"  Edward: \\"I don't want to, but I will if you marry me first.\\"  Jacob: \\"No, Bella. Stay human and choose me.\\"  Bella: \\"Sorry, Jacob. I only love you as a friend.\\"    Then rinse and repeat as necessary.    I do, however, have good things to say about the director. Given that he has this lousy storyline to work with, at least he brought some action to this installment. Meyer's books have a tendency to build up suspense to a breaking point, then fail to fulfill those promises. At least Slade mananged to give the movie some parts where a genuine sense of danger manages to dissolve the mushy, crappy romance angle when it desperately needed it.    As far as Breaking Dawn goes, my masochistic tendency to follow a story through to the end will not permit me to miss the chance to observe and carefully dissect everything that will be wrong with that train-wreck waiting to happen. Doubt me? Just wait and see....
006621131X|4.0|Patti Smith wrote an account of her relationship and friendship with Robert Mapplethorpe with love and without turning it into a showcase for her own life and career. The book gives a delicate and sweet picture without sugarcoating the reality of their lives. A good book for fans of Patti Smith, Robert Mapplethorpe or the 70s and 80s art and music scene, as well as fans of New York City.
1423113381|5.0|Oh my gosh!  This book is so good.  I'm a 37 year old Mom and I love this one just as much as the Percy Jackson series.  Definitely a good read.  Haven't been able to put it down yet.  Can't wait to read it to my kids.
B000Y7ZHCU|5.0|Great concert! I think I have watched it over four times since I got it, and I still haven't gotten burned out.<br />Very graceful, and well put together. Perfect for a rainy night. Sit back, enjoy to a hot cup of hot chocolate.~Definitely<br />worth purchasing~Great as a gift as well.
B003V5PPZG|1.0|It's always scary when there's not samples of the music at least to check out.  Why isn't there any?  Scared people might freak out.  I'm not buying until I hear something first at least.  Oh well...
193413712X|3.0|I would not have chosen this particular book if it hadn't been for our book club.  It was not an uplifting story....but a lot of life experiences are hardly \\"uplifting\\".  It provided good discussion and added to my reading resume.
0440234743|5.0|Most of John Grisham's novels are interesting because of his sense of humor. Moreover, his insight on human life gives readers different understanding of others behaviors.
B002JVWR9U|1.0|It's an ok series. Nothing special and it would of gotten two stars but was disappointed in delivery.

B003OJBWGK|5.0|Easily the best CD I've listened to in quite a while.  Brilliant all the way thru.  I'm not sure what my favorite song is here - they're so many good ones: \\"When I'm With You\\", \\"Bratty B\\", \\"Our Deal\\", \\"Summary Mood\\", \\"Boyfriend\\", \\"Crazy For You\\", \\"I Want To\\".  Not sure what to compare it to but I do get the good vibe feeling circa mid-sixties Beach Boys era.  Highly recommended!
B000KKPN5C|4.0|I do a lot of indoor shooting and in some larger spaces as good as most people think the onboard flash is for their cameras they usually are limited to about 11-12 feet (give or take based on lens being used). Also you are not able to bounce the flash on your subjects. Hence why I purchased the SB-400 it is extremely portable due to its extremely small size. It has an adjustable flash with 4 different angles along with being able to use 2 - AA batteries. It is iTT-L compatible which means you can CONTROL the strength of the flash via your camera. I am extremely satisfied and think anyone who feels limited with their onboard flash buy this flash! I ordered the Sten-Flo diffuser for this and will post an update upon use.
B003JTHETY|4.0|Yes! Finally...Maiden is back!  It's hard to believe that these guys have rocked for 30 years! Back in fine form and sound, Maiden literally goes to the heavens with this one. As a fan off and on since 1982, I guess I'm one of those fans that Dickenson always jokes about: \\"The grumpy 40 and 50 year olds who aren't satisfied until we play our old classic songs...\\"  I loved seeing their 'reunion' tour in 2000. 'Brave New World' was very good, not great. 'Dance of Death' was a huge letdown, just awful. 'Benjamin Breeg' was also good. If you really listen to 'Final Frontier' you'll notice all kinds of good bits, hooks, and sci-fi lyrics that all pay homage to their classic songs of the 80's. Yes, Maiden's best period-Hands down. The new album is outstanding. Clearly the track that stands out as the best is \\"El Dorado.\\" (The familiar true story of the City of Gold from Spanish Conquistador times) Dickenson, now in his 50's, still has his trademark metal-voice. A bit huskier than days gone by, but that's fine. Nicko is phenomenal as usual. His drumming hasn't slowed with age, either. Harris and the rest of the lads are truly enjoying themselves and their amazing sucess. One of the few Metal bands that have recruited a whole new generation of fans recently with the last 2 albums, especially. The 'Mission Edition' comes in a space-portal window case and the cool cover art featuring an ALIEN-like Eddie. This album is the apology for their 'Dance of Death'. No problem. As for the rumors about this being their last? Bruce has said, \\"I don't know. I don't think any of us know if it will end up being our last. But if it turns out to be, I'm very proud of this one.\\"   It rocks. Old fan or new-it will rock your world!
B0018PH3L0|5.0|Lonesome Dove is one of the greatest and most historically accurate westerns I have ever watched. A grand tour of the old west as it really was. Desolate, forbidden, dangerous and a challenge to  all of your senses , this recreation of history in the late 19th century is  as good as it gets. Superb performances by Duvall and Jones are  nearly topped by those of Diane Lane, Robert Urich and Danny Glover, oh and I shouldn't forget Newt.... I also own Streets of Laredo and Dead Man's Walk and intend to purchase Return To Lonesome Dove in the near future. What a set of videos , what an author to create the atmosphere from which these marvelous films were made. Brush the dust off your chaps , check your sidearms , and walk through the swinging doors into a magnificent piece of our American Heritage...B.D.Griffiths Sr.
B001BNFR6W|1.0|There are definitely problems with the discs. They appear to be perfectly fine and without scratches, but still won't play. My main issues was with the season 1 disc 1. I could only watch the first couple episodes then they would freeze or just not play at all. I tried playing it on my computer and other players, but no such luck. I ordered a replacement and am still having the same problems. I wish that I would have read the reviews beforehand because I never would have bought it. I will be attempting to get my money back.
B00110K62U|5.0|Saw this live years ago.  Couldn't forget it, but this brought it all back in HiDef, up close and personal, with a Dream Cast!!!  Could not have been better!!!  At first I played it every day in the background of my housework.  Also share it with others who love this musical.  THE BEST EVER!!
B002N5N5LG|5.0|Fantastic series and great attention to detail on the DVD set. Four outtake reels are worth the price alone!
B0021L8V0M|5.0|I loved this movie so much! I saw the trailer and was like.. WOW!    I saw that it didn't get good reviews but those people need to rethink those ideas. This is movie is as amazing as any other Angie. Jolie flick.
B00382X4XC|2.0|Black Sabbath \\"Heaven And Hell\\" is a great cd. But this so called remastered version lacks volume. The cd does not play loud enough to be a great remastered cd. I have lots of remastered cds that play two or three times louder than this cd when played at the same volume when doing a comparison test. 24 bit remastering is available. It is unfortunate that record labels don't use the latest technology when it comes to remastering cds. All I wish for is some record label to get it right and remaster all the Black Sabbath cds using 24 bit technology. Is that too much to ask for?
0449000729|5.0|Fantastic novel based Wiltshire England.  It covers prehistoric times up to the 20th century centered around Stone Henge.  An easy,enjoyable read with vivid characters.  I am going to dread the last pages as I want it to go on and on....
B0026P3G12|5.0|Susan Boyle has a beautiful voice and her songs on this CD are very intersting as some are personal.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|This book begin with 6 victors remaining from the Quarter Quell. There is a war between the rebels and the Capitol. It is Katniss Everdeen versus President Snow.    I really like the way this trilogy wrapped up. I am glad that read all 3 books back to back and did not have to wait for the next book. I would highly recommend it for anyone young or young at heart!
B002L5GQGY|5.0|I am totally captivated with Joe. I saw him on PBS special and I am now addicted to him. I have purchased cd's; dvd's and have tickets to an upcoming concert. I have never been a big blues fan until now. This guy is wonderful. I have told all my friends and they are now addicted, too. There is something sweet and boy-next-door about him, yet terribly sultry and sexy.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I really enjoyed this book!  Thankfully, I finished reading The Hunger Games right before this so everything was still fresh in my mind.  The book begins by explaining the duties and formalities of the Victory Tour.  Katniss and Peeta have to adjust to life in Victory Village until the Quarter Quell is introduced.  They both go back to participate in the 75th Hunger Games all over again.  This time the games are different and the alliances that are created don't quite make sense until the end.
B000K4WPCC|5.0|An excelent Industry resource disk if purchased as a matched set of five. The other four disks are:<br />The Ruins,<br />She's the man,<br />Venom,<br />Cruel World.<br />Regards,<br />Burn ( Black Sun.....Metaltrance ).
B0001HLVS2|5.0|There are not many movies that actually enhance the reading of a good book, much less books, but Master and Commander does exactly that.<br /><br />Patrick O'Brian's Aubery-Maturin series is the kind of literature that sucks you in and won't let go.  While telling the story of a charismatic British Naval sea captain and his ships surgeon, O'Brian recreated the whole world of the 19th century British seaman.  But as wonderful as those books are with thier nautical language and exciting stories, you can't imagine what you don't know.<br /><br />In this wonderful movie Peter Weir brings the world of Aubery-Maturin to life.  You see it all--the farm animals, the men covering the ropes, the Marines in their red coats actually seated on deck.  You see the ocean and the fragility of the ship HMS Surprise.  You see the midshipmen, children by our standards, with men's responsibilities, risking their lives.<br /><br />This is a movie to watch, and watch again.  I loved every minute of it, and see something new every time I see it.  Its a long movie and yet, I can't help wishing it were longer.  I don't know if Weir ever considered making a sequel.  I know I would love to see one.
B000KITQK2|5.0|I purchased this to use as a DI box for an electric violin.  Wow.  No disappointment here.  This little deal is great!  Warms up the sound of a piezo pickup & it's a great little DI box too.  Has a level setting switch and a ground lift in addition to the tone, output level, and blend dials.  I would say this must be used with an AC adapter, since it ate up my 9-volt batteries faster than JAWS.  Great product, well worth the price, even at twice the Amazon price!  Get one for your electric violin now!
B000001Y79|5.0|It might seem cliché to say that the first major record a band releases is the best of all of its CD's; however, I believe it not to be completely deranged for me to claim that Tragic Kingdom is No Doubt's greatest compendium of musical talent. I make this claim because Tragic Kingdom fuses all of No Doubt's musical nuances and specialties into one disc. The music is a true sampling of the entire spectrum of No Doubt's musical capabilities. There is a wonderful mixture of ska, pop, rock, and punk influences that when taken together create a spectacular treat for the ears.
B003F3NDWG|5.0|The Castle series is one worth watching for the dialouge and the fatastic acting.  Many have tried and few have succeeded in making a cop show both criminally interesting and witty at the same time.  I love Castle because it breaks the monotony of the procedural cop shows and their almost maniacal aversion to being even the least bit humorous or entertaining.  And Stana Katic is a babe.
B001EN71CW|5.0|This is an amazing show.  Do not pass up the opportunity to purchase.  Great video and audio quality, and the characters are unforgettable.
B001PPLIEG|1.0|Marc Foster created a very nonsensical film that lacks narrative and direction. James Bond is simply not present in this film.  This robotic, and malfuctioning, killing machine that Daniel Craig portrays always does things without the slightest bit of regret or thought. He's respsonible for the death of two members of the british secret service. Bond's personal escapades gets Agents Fields killed, he  tosses a special branch agent off a roof, and kills suspects on a whim. What the hell is wrong with M ? Not only should this guy should NOT be a Double-O agent, he should be imprisioned for life. His motivations make no sense either. Why exactly did he rescue Camille, who tried to kill him moments earlier, that first time ?  How could he have possibly know she was in danger ? Why did he hand a random guy his phony business card ? How could he have known anything was going on at that opera house by simply glancing at bags on a table ? Also seducing Agent Fields was right down there with Steve Urkel seducing Laura Winslow in Family Matters. \\"I can't seem to find the stationery\\", please.    Also in the vein of Licence To Kill it's a matter of not taking a breather just once to enjoy the woman, food, or drink. Hell the writers don't even give Bond enough time to put on his tuxedo. I am not saying you need one in every film but if your going to have one, give him a chance to get one ! He actually steals one at the opera house in a matter of secounds and amazingly, it fits.* That is just too much to buy. They try to shove in some of the old 007 charm pathetically with the clumsy Fields seduction, I reiterate, \\"I can't seem to find the stationery\\".       I really could not care less about Greene's evil scheme of stealing water and lord do they try and make this seem important. Every once and a while the issue of Bolvia's water supply comes up from some random conversation and Greene simply states that water is the most precious resource and for no reason at all, Bolivia's Agua is the priority. There is also a painfully left wing slant in this film, \\"going after the oil is wrong !\\". I don't want to get into politics but all I am going to say is Felix Leiter and M, especially M, should really know better.     Simply put this is a very poor Bond film. Dominique Greene is the most bland antagonist in the series' history, a stupid rap song for a main theme, the cut-a-secound and badly presented action pieces, and an un-charismatic Bond girl.    * To further expose the idiocy of that scene, one doesn't need to look any further than the previous Bond outing. Bond complained to Vesper in Casino Royale how she couldn't replace his own dinner jacket properly without knowing his exact measurements.
B003Y5H4SO|4.0|People trapped in an elevator...with Satan!  Does it get anymore freaky than that?  M. Night Shyamalan conjoured up a suspenseful premise and let Director John Dowdle (Quarantine, Poughkeepsie Tapes) dance with the Devil.  The result is a simple but effective thriller that is sure to horrify.<br /><br />An unsettling suicide in the City of Brotherly Love seems to open the gates (or elevator shaft) for The Dark Lord to impose his will on a group of sinners.  Police are baffled as they watch from the outside, trying to identify the culprit for these brutal crimes as they occur.<br /><br />Is Hollywood finally discovering that less is indeed more?  Don't be expecting lots of action here--it's a slow burner, taking place almost entirely in one confiscated setting.  It's not especially gruesome either, but it's sure to butcher your brain trying to pinpoint the murderer.  Many of the kills happen quickly when the lights conveniently flicker.<br /><br />DEVIL is very well written and acted by a group of up-and-coming actors.  It stops well short of the potential shock factor it could have obtained, but it's no slouch in the scare department either.  Part one of the Night Chronicles trilogy.
B000NU2CY4|1.0|I will not rehash all the explanations on the problems with the Gladiator Blu-ray - please read the other reviews for a technical explanation. Suffice it to say there is a \\"new\\" version that has been cleaned up and looks gorgeous and there is an \\"old\\" version that is junk. The old version was so bad that the studio recognized it and decided it needed to be corrected.<br /><br />But guess what, Amazon insists on clearing out their old stock and selling you the junk version. I ordered this last week and figured there is no way they would be doing this. But guess what, I WAS WRONG.<br /><br />Here's a giveaway - on the cover of the case there is a mail in rebate that expired in JUNE 2010!!!<br /><br />Absolutely pathetic showing by Amazon.
0812416503|4.0|I had known about this book for as long as I can remember, but just recently read it for the first time. What a great read! I thought that because it was written in 1938 it might be good but would be hard to read, etc. Not true. It moves really quickly and the story really grips you from the very beginning. It only took me about 5 days to read. It would have taken less time than that, but as I reached the end I wanted to make it last so I slowed down the pace. There are a few twists that I definitely did not see coming. I loved this book and plan to read some of Du Maurier's others as well. The 1940 Hitchcock film is a nice complement to the book, but just bear in mind that they do make some changes and it's not exactly true to the book, but still entertaining in its own right. I highly recommend the book and the movie!
0345505387|4.0|I was expecting a graphic novel.  Was it as richly rewarding as one of Gabaldon's full 900 page novels?  No, but I didn't expect it to be the same experience as digesting one of the novels.  I found it satisfying on its own as a fresh format for a much loved story.    Artwork:  I agree with some other reviewers who say it can be a little confusing to follow:  there is a lot of action packed into a small package and it moves quickly.  I had to backtrack to keep up with who was who sometimes, and I had to remind myself to start at the top of the panel so I could understand the progression of the conversation.  But the artwork is rich and brilliant overall, if somewhat inconsistent, and I was thrilled that the characters look like Scots for the most part. Didn't really care a whit that they don't exactly match the descriptions in the book.      Story:  This is a good supplement to the Outlander novels, for those who already know the story and can tap into their own knowledge of what isn't shown in the panels, particularly the depth of the character development featured in the novels.  This piece primarily showcases the action, and layers on key events that took place outside of the presence of the novel's first person narrator.  There are interesting new plot twists - the author is great at picking up loose threads and spinning them into new strands.  The book adds new dimensions to the story, while understandably falling short of the novels in terms of emotional sway.     I liked it fine.  It'll be a nice addition to the collection.
B002N5N4M6|5.0|I've heard some people claim that TBBT is slipping a little bit, how could it not when the first two seasons were so good. But for me, the last half of the season redeemed my confidence in the show from guys in hot pink dresses calling Sheldon a crazy person to finally solving the mystery of the blown out elevator shaft, to Penny's new boyfriend thinking the guys are going to blow up the moon, to Sheldon's first major interactions with a female not unlike him...they were able to create some unique situations for the boys. The extras here include a gag reel (they probably had days of material to chose from.), the cast answers some fan questions over Chinese food on the BBT living room set, and a set tour with Simon and Kunal (Howard and Raj). The only downside is now that they've moved to Thursday...I have nothing meaningful to watch on Mondays...I guess I'll be going to bed at 8:30 or curling up with a good book.
1416972242|5.0|I cannot wait for the next one in the series.  If you felt a let down, when the twilight books were over, this will help lift your spirits.  For those that didn't like the twilight series(are there really people like that out there?) It is different and unique enough that you just may find your own thrill here!
B000BO0NMU|4.0|I started reading the \\"Sword of Truth\\" series after watching \\"The Legend of the Seeker\\" on TV.  The series was PG, maybe PG13 for some episodes.  The books are R.  Great story, great characters, easy to pick up and not put down, but very graphic brutality, gore, and rape.  A few cursewords also.  I just wanted to make this clear for any parents ;)
0981951244|5.0|After having listened to dozens of interviews Darren Hardy has done with great, successful leaders who have had proven success, I thought I might purchase the download of his book, The Compound Effect and listen to it in my car while driving the 11 hours to Cleveland on a business trip.  While I enjoy reading different kinds of books, I tend to gravitate toward the ones that help me to be a better me.  The Compound Effect has been a wealth of inspiration and encouragement to me in the past few months.  The reason for this is because although I've been learning from a lot of great people, Darren has a way of sharing his experiences (successes and failures) in a way with which I can relate.  The audio book version is what I purchased, and I like the way Darren goes off book a few times to share these life experiences, or certain details of an interview he has conducted with someone that we weren't privy to before. Now, all the things that Darren is talking about in the book, The core Values Assessment, the Goal setting, the little things each day that we do that add up over time, they're all things that we probably have heard before.  However, the one who says \\"Heard it all before\\" is, in my humble opinion, the one who \\"needs to hear it more\\".  The trip I took to Cleveland was with a friend who was also listening to the book.  This friend of mine, just by doing a little thing each day, has now gone 7 weeks without a cigarette.  Now, people quit smoking all the time, I did, 09/14/2004 to be exact, but the difference here is that my friend had been trying to quit over and over and over again and again.  Yet, nothing seemed to work.  Not even promising himself for his Grandaughters' sake!  But because he picked up a simple set of tools from the Compound Effect, and put them into practice, not only has he quit smoking, he is now on to a few additional endeavors (at 56 years young!) that he is really excited about.  Did The Compound Effect do this for my friend? Who can say for sure.  But I know he is different after having listened to Darren's book a few times.  I know I'm better because of it.  I know that I spend more time caring about my family and the people I want to help rather than what some negetive people in my life think of me.  I believe this book is a great resource for anyone who wants to see a change in their life during the course of any given time period.  As long as the reader takes action and actually puts into practice what they are learning. This book is certainly worth reading at least twice.  And the resources that Darren provides for the reader, free, (even for those who haven't purchased the book) are incredible. The thing is this, Darren Hardy has had much success prior to writing this book.  He was a millionaire at a young age because he chose to listen to what people like him are saying. Find a passion. Do something you love, not for money, but because you're passionate about it.  Help others do the same.  Help others see the potential in themselves.  Darren Hardy doesn't have to sell a book to make a living.  He just wanted to do something on a larger scale to help a lot of people. I never thought that I would want to help others have more success in their lives..  funny, now I can't stop wanting to.  I think tomorrow morning, I am going to review my weekly Rhythm Register, Because I have an appointment with Mo.  Big Mo.
B002ZG98J6|3.0|A fun movie, my daughter who is 13 particularly enjoys this movie. The acting is on par with this type of movie and the storyline moves along at a reasonable pace. Good movie to sit and watch with your kid.
B003XF1XOQ|1.0|I  don't understand how so many people could give this 5 Stars.     At the beginning of the summer I received a recommendation to read The Hunger Games' series. And I dove in and read then both in 4 days. While I felt the novels were dark, I enjoyed the story line. I was impressed with the creativity of the author and I couldn't wait to read the end. I made a HUGE mistake and purchased Mockingjay on Pre-Order. It was awful. By the end I wanted to punch Katniss in the face. Collins failed to advance the plot and she failed to build on the development of the characters that she spent 2 novels working on and that I devoted myself to. As a reader I have to like at least one of the main characters, and I feel it is the author's responsibility to make me understand the other characters. In this last book Katniss was whiny, indecisive and weak. This is not someone who could lead a revolution. Who would be inspired by this character? I felt duped and angry that I was willing to follow her at all, but I still had hopes after the first two novels. I knew early in Mockingjay who Katniss was going to end up with. Gail and Peeta both were great characters until Mockingjay. Peeta could have not even been mentioned and it's like Collins worked overtime to convince the reader that Gail's is a bad person. Except I don't believe it, I felt like I knew Gail from the first two and this change in him doesn't jive. Is it the war, is Gail running around on the front lines. Did Gail get thrown in the Hunger Games himself. Oh wait no it was his love for Katniss that made him a bad person. I just can't grasp it. The Gail in the first two novels had a good heart, bitter but good. This final novel was dark without reason and without realism. War is Dark. I get that and as a member of military I see it everyday. However darkness in this novel wasn't real. There was no light. Hope is the thing that drives the soldiers of war. By the end I didn't care about the characters. I didn't care if therewas an end to the Hunger Games. I didn't care that the districts were destroyed. And it was obvious the author didn't care either. It was like she had a page requirement. Stretch the novel to reach it and then wrapped it up with three paragraphs at the end. If I read a thousand pages, even if you fail to work on a reasonable plot, even if you fail to develop the characters, do me the courtesy of a quality ending. Something that makes those previous pages worth the read. I cannot in good faith recommend any of the Hunger Games, because I wouldn't want some one to feel obligated to finish it.
B003UYUR10|4.0|A few of my friends, die hard Princeo of Persia game fans, advised me not to pick up this movie. With Netflix and my pretty large movie collection I didn't see any reason to own this one, but for reasons I dont even understand (probably cus people kept telling me not to watch it) I picked this up on Blu ray. And all I can say is Im happy that I went against my better judgement and picked this baby up!     First and foremost Im not into the games, being a gamer myself I couldnt get into the games. From my perspective PoP looks like it has alot of high flying parkour and the main hero fighting a billion badguys by himself, and a dagger that shifts time. And guess what? This movie has all of that! The storyline is solid and I feel that the characters were surprisingly fleshed out, from the main character to the villain to all the supporting guys. With recent big budget action/fantasy movies it seemed like the pacing was out of whack (i.e. Clash of the Titans) but this movie got it right for the most part.  Overall the movie greatly exceeded my expectations.      That being said there are a few things I think could have been improved. First being our hero, I know Jake whatchamacallit looks the part but his acting is something else all together.  No matter what he's in you just cant get attached to the character.  Now we all know theres going to be a sequel since Disney is trying to capture more of the younger male audience and it cant ride the Pirates craze forever so hopefully Jake can get it together next time.  Dont get me wrong he didnt drag my movie experience down but looking at how he's a box office letdown the movie could have probably faired alot better without him.  Secondly I know no one else cared but Im tired of all foreign oriented movies made in the U.S. where everyone has British accents.  Last time I checked i dont think Persians had any contact with Britain during their hey day...>_> Also my final gripe is how the characters kept having to explain keyplot points over and over again. I know dastan and tus werent in the same room together when they found out about whatever but WE were so they could have spared us that.      Over all this is a good movie and if youre into action/fantasy with some good acting and killer fight scenes (personal favorite was the knife fight at the end that didnt even have dastan..killer stuff) its definitely worth picking up. Usually the newer movies dont get alot of play time on my blu ray player but this one has, and if that says anything its give this one a go and help disney put something other than Pirates out for their live action stuff (Tron aside...)

B000MV90IU|5.0|Bullitt, starring Steve McQueen is an excellent thriller and one that has one of the gratest car chases in Movie History (McQueen's Mustang Vs the Bad Guys Dodge Charger).  This movie also stars Robert Vaughn and has many twists in the plot but is an ecellent film.  I highly recommend it.
0670034711|5.0|I just read this book and must say I am profoundly grateful to Elizabeth Gilbert for such an inspiring, witty, honest book. I can so relate to much of this book, and it has affected my life positively as well. Her quest for God has inspired my own self-exploration and spirituality, which was far more than I ever imagined happening when I opened the book. Customer comments here laden with judgments are incredibly ironic in that this spirituality she finds is all about non-judgments.
B003TJ4YU6|5.0|Yes it is all in black and white. Ed Sullivan wasn't broadcasting in color yet. The Beatles fantastic as always, especially the very interesting interpretation of \\"Help!\\" in show four. The rest of the acts are a mixed bag. Some are pretty bad \\"borscht belt\\" type comedians, some are performers who were very big in their day and were good. Check out Mitzi Gaynor, hot stuff. Watch that segment and you will see what I mean. Overall, very enjoyable.
0446615641|5.0|Filled with suspense, thriller, and excitement, Stone Cold is everything I expected from a Baldacci's novel. The author grabbed my attention right from the beginning and held it until the very end of the novel.    Oliver Stone is the leader of the mysterious Camel Club. The Camel Club consists of three other men with different personalities and jobs ranging from a librarian, ex-soldier, and a genius with OCD. In the past, members of the Camel Club have band together to carry out esoteric missions that have saved the life of their leader. The Camel Club may be called on again to help their leader and friend. Stone's past life is threatening to catch-up with his present life. Some of Stone's co-workers from the past are turning up dead. Is it possible that these deaths are not coincidental and that the person/persons responsible for the deaths knows about Stone and wants him dead too. Will Stone's secret life be exposed because of this scandal?  Thanks to the former head of the CIA, Carter Gray, Stone might get the opportunity to find out. Gray's connection with a secret ploy to have two of Russia's head of state leaders killed may haunt him and Stone.    I have enticed you enough. You will have to read the book to find out what happens :-)
B001AQO400|5.0|For those people who have reviewed this as boring - you are completely missing the point - but I'm not going to argue with you. This film tells the honest story of a lonely man in a troubled marriage - lost in a big noisy metropolis at the top of a big empty hotel. It's perfect - for the way it accurately tells that story. Sofia Coppola succeeds in pulling you inside the hotel and feeling that unique feeling of being away from home - lost. She has a way of pulling the viewer into the emotion of a scene and not letting go - where others may cut away - she makes sure you see those looks, those glances - those moments that we all understand. That is where the strength of this film lies - in its ability to yearn for its characters. I even liked Ana Faris's performance - although she was characterised as a pinheaded actress - the dialogue was so good when there - but not there if it didn't need to be.     Scarlett johansson & Bill Murray's performances are flawless- it's more like improv really - an uncertain but poignant attraction between them that need not go further - and need not display love-making to make its point. I would imagine that they didn't know each other at all at the start of filming - and so it makes the shyness and the banter between them even more attractive.    The only thing that I don't like is that it doesn't continue - but it has to end.    I'm so glad a friend asked me to see this back in 2004, it's one of my favourite films - totally original, unique and personal to the viewer.    6 stars!!! :)
0307473465|1.0|After reading the description and reviews I thought I would really like this book, but I didn't like it at all! It was very slow and boring and I honestly didn't care what happened by Part 3 of the book!<br /><br />This book is about a young boy (age 15) who gets seduced by a much older women (in her thirtys). This takes place post WWII. Then later he finds the woman (Hannah) awaiting a trial. She was a guard for one of the concentration camps and held responsible for a lot of women's lives.<br /><br />I felt nothing for Hannah or the kid (I can't even remember his name), but she calls him kid throuhout the whole book! I was sick at the fact that this older women seduced this boy and in turn ruined his life! He was never the same and could never have a decent relationship with another women because she screwed him up so bad! When she went to trial I still felt nothing...just like the kid kept saying...I felt the same way. The last few chapters were touching in a way, but in a way they were just sad! This kid devoted his whole life to this women and I found it to be very pathetic! By the end of this book I just wanted it to be over with and thought about just not finishing it at all. I usually love books that relate to the Holocaust, but this book just happened to be set in that time period and really didn't have much to do with it at all.<br /><br />I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone. It was only 200 or so pages and it felt like it was 1000 to me. This book could have been written in 50 pages or less without all the boring details and relayed the same thing I felt when I was done reading it. I felt like I wasted a few hours of my life on some stupid story that I could never get back!!!!<br /><br />Oh and also this remineded me of the reason I steer clear away from Oprah's Book Club Books...they are never worth a flip!
0891419063|5.0|As a spouse of a veteran marine, reading this book gave me a total new perspective of War, and a lot of respect for our servicemen from yesterday and today.  The sacrificed lives, the will to survive, the chaos that war brings to humanity, definitely confirmed that in war there are no winners.  The author describes his experiences in Peleliu and Okinawa to details, chocking at times, amusing at others.  Mr. Sledge was an extraordinary Marine who throughout his experiences in combat related in his book, show us that even in the midst of despair, the spirit of the Marine Corps values and training prevails.
B00005Y228|5.0|I purchased the CD for one song \\"FEVER\\". I LOVE IT!!!  remainder of the songs have close to the same beat. After a while I have to turn it off. I have to admit she has a great voice.
B000AJIF4E|5.0|I own the MDR - 6000 also, and these are definately slightly better, a little more comfy and less heavy too. Anyhoo, if youre going to trouble yourself with getting good headphones, go with one of these. Sony is the best. These headphones are an amazing unit!!!!!!
B003MZ0I84|4.0|I've been to thirty-six concerts to see this band and waiting for the release of Hands All Over, I had extremely high hopes after being disappointed with their follow up to \\"Songs About Jane,\\" \\"It Won't Be Soon Before Long.\\" I remember concert #1 and falling in love with the sound of this band that was lost in their sophomore effort. Yet as I began to listen to their third album via streaming last week, and every day since, I've discovered, that with the help of producer Mutt Lange (AC/DC, Shania Twain), Maroon 5 has recovered much of the style I fell head over heels for in the first place.      Misery (5/5): The song, despite its melancholy message, was tailor made for summer radio. In fact, there's no better way to listen to the song than rolling the windows down in your car and turning up the volume. Maroon 5 was searching for a funkier sound with their last album, It Won't Be Soon Before Long, and that was evident in Makes Me Wonder. However, it appears with Misery, they found the way to do so that highlighted all of their strengths in a way that MMW didn't. With a hook that will stick in your head, it was perfect for their debut single.    Give a Little More (5/5): Already established as their second single, Give a Little More picks up melodically where Misery left off, an improvement on their last album. Less sugary than Misery, and with a far more sexy sound, the track features a really strong pre-chorus and a danceable beat.    Stutter (4.5/5): Despite the fact that I rated the song the way I did, this is actually my favorite song on the album. It definitely has a more power pop feel than the other songs on the album and I liked the bridge immensely. However, the harmonies actually make this song feel weaker, as does the doubling/tripling of Adam's voice. The result is a sound that feels more like the Jonas Brothers than a charged up rock song. However, what makes the song weak on the album, which I chalk up to overproduction of the track, is absent in thelive performances of the song. Perhaps this disappointed me because I know how intense of a stage-stomping track this is live and I was let down by the album version. Still, I liked the song... a lot, which proves just how much potential this track has.    Don't Know Nothing (3/5): This song disappointed me greatly. With the three prior tracks as strong as they are, Don't Know Nothing was a let down. With its Motown feel, it didn't flow with the tone of the album that had been set thus far and just seems out of place once you listen to the rest of it. It sounds like it should be an unreleased track: one that wasn't good enough to make an album, but decent enough to make it popular amongst diehards.    Never Gonna Leave This Bed (3.5/5 for the original, 4.5/5 for the acoustic): It took a few listens before this song really caught on with me. The opening piano/keyboard progression annoyed me slightly. I think it reminded me too much of those mini, high-pitched keyboards that you give to small children. The lyrics were also a little weak to me, but weak lyrics can be saved by a good melody. And they are... just in the acoustic version, which thankfully dropped the toy-like sound and replaced it with intermittent piano and a great percussion beat. It's the stripped down nature of the song that makes it so endearing and much truer to Maroon 5's style.    I Can't Lie (3.5/5): When I heard this song for the first time, it struck me as a cross between Lauryn Hill's \\"Doo Wop (That Thing)\\" and Billy Joel's \\"River of Dreams.\\" Considering the band's love of both, it doesn't surprise me. It's not that the song is bad, because it's very reminiscent of the middle tracks of their first album, \\"Songs About Jane.\\" But that's all this song really is... a middle track. It's pleasant and airy. It's good, but it's not great. Still, enjoyable nonetheless.    Hands All Over (3/5): It's in this song that I can really hear Mutt Lange's touch as a producer. It has eighties rock written all over it... no pun intended. Lyrically, the song is kind of weak and the track reminds me way too much of \\"Pour Some Sugar On Me.\\" Its attempt at a sexy sound is kind of lost on me.    How (4/5): \\"How\\" REALLY surprised me. It brought me back to \\"Songs About Jane\\" in a great way and even though the lyric \\"I'm asking for your help/I am going through hell\\" is not the most profound, something about it worked. Is the bridge predictable? Maybe, but why mess with something that's not broken?    Get Back in My Life (3.5/5): The opening oohs will probably become an annoyance to me when I reach play number 100 on the album, but it's not a bad song. Its overall sound reminds me very much of It Won't Be Soon Before Long, as in it's ALMOST there, but not quite. It's funky, but it doesn't have the poppy appeal of Misery or sexy sound of Give a Little More. At the very least, the melody will be something you can hum.    Just a Feeling (5/5): To me, this song was the biggest surprise of the entire album in the best way possible. It fits right in with \\"She Will Be Loved\\" and \\"Sunday Morning\\" for me and in all honesty, could fit right into the soundtrack of the latest romantic comedy playing in theaters. There's something so easy about the song, but so romantic and touching at the same time. I think that out of all the songs on the album, this has the greatest potential to be the mainstream ballad. It's like a great prom song without the cheesiness. I just LOVE it.    Runaway (4.5/5): When I heard that Sam Farrar of Phantom Planet fame had leant his writing talents to this song, I had high hopes for the track. And they were met 100%. Another song that could fit into a movie, the chorus contrasts the verse in all of the best ways and blends the funky guitar into a piano-driven melody JUST right. It's almost the bridge between the Maroon 5 of 2001 and the Maroon 5 of 2010. The key change in the final chorus is beautifully done, as is the addition of the falsetto.    Out Of Goodbyes (2/5): This song ends the non-deluxe version of the album and it really confuses me. Just a Feeling and Runaway establish a great feel as Hands All Over draws to a close and Out of Goodbyes throws the formula out the window. There's a reason I enjoy Maroon 5's music, but this makes me forget all about it. It seems to ramble and I had a hard time distinguishing the verses from the choruses from the pre-chorus. The only part of the song I enjoyed was the end riff. For a band that ended Songs About Jane with \\"Sweetest Goodbye,\\" this was a let down.     **DELUXE VERSION**    The B-sides of It Won't Be Soon Before Long (Infatuation, Losing My Mind) were FAR better than the B-sides of Hand All Over. But Last Chance (3.5/5) isn't bad and will find a place in the heart of diehard Maroon 5 fans like myself, even if slightly overproduced. No Curtain Call (3.5/5) has much stronger verses than the aforementioned B-side, but its chorus is weaker, so it balances out.    The acoustic version of Never Gonna Leave This Bed is worth the price of the deluxe disc alone (see the joint review with the original album track above).    I have to give the acoustic version of Misery a 5/5. I wasn't sure how Maroon 5 would attack this song, especially for unplugged sets that constantly air on TV and the web. Instead of just taking out the keyboard and changing to acoustic guitars, as many artists do, they REWORKED THE ENTIRE SONG and gave me a new perspective on the lyrics in doing so. It now has a sultry simmer that the original didn't have. It's not better or worse than it's sister track, I'd in fact say it's equal. However the fact that they can do so much with an acoustic version and change the entire feel of Misery is not just impressive, but attests to just how good Maroon 5 really is.    Rounding out the album is the cover of Alicia Keys's \\"If I Ain't Got You,\\" which I had previously heard live. When Adam informed the crowd that they'd be covering this song, I was very worried. But it turnedout to be a great tribute to Alicia and an example of just how versatile Adam has become as a singer, especially when he drives through the chorus. I'd give it a 5/5 hands down.    Overall, the album is definitely an improvement over \\"It Won't Be Soon Before Long\\" and the band seems to be embracing their \\"Songs About Jane\\" roots better than they had before. However, SAJ created shoes that were hard to fill. While it didn't quite live up to Jane's standards, \\"Hands All Over\\" is a solid album with some clear radio darlings and a refreshing sound. Averaging all of the standard tracks' scores, I arrived at a 4/5.

0374158460|5.0|Forget politics, this is a novel about families. That politics, left and right, are a constant subtext tells you that Jonathan Franzen knows his way around the early twenty-first century, but, ultimately, the characters are not the sum of their political inclinations.    Jonathan Franzen must have read both the Bible and Sigmund Freud. Certainly the sins of the parents are visited on several generations of characters. Franzen is very knowing about the ways in which people overcompensate for what they perceive to be the foibles of their forebears. And he's deliberate about letting moral strengths and weaknesses play out in the lives of his characters. A subtext here and a metaphor for all Franzen seems to feel about the fate of the world is the peril of the cerulean warbler, one of a multitude of songbirds under threat from loss of habitat and roving housecats.     Franzen's Patty Emerson Berglund is one of the most nuanced characters in modern fiction. We meet her as a compulsively civic-minded mother of two in a St. Paul neighborhood being rehabilitated. Only when we learn that neither of her affluent Westchester County, NY, parents took her side when she was date-raped as a teenager  do we begin to see what, besides a seemingly inborn streak of competitiveness, drives her. Walter Berglund, Patty's husband, is a stalwart lawyer and nature lover whose almost saint-like even-handedness belies the rage he carries about his father's alcoholism and his mother's passivity. Once you know this, it's easy to see the attraction of both Patty and Walter to Richard Katz, a rock musician and consummate bad-boy, that will create lasting tension in their marriage. Katz,too, has a family history that puts his actions into perspective.    Patty is a good-enough mother to their daughter, Jessica, but she forms an unnerving identification with her son, Joey. When he takes up with Connie Monaghan, the daughter of the working-class single mother next door, Patty is shattered. As in hisearlier novel The Corrections, Franzen is willing to create complex and not totally admirable characters. There are, however, moments when almost every character acts more admirably than the reader might expect. Just as consistently, they often behave horribly as the unintended consequences of their intentions play out. By the time redemption rolls around, there are a lot of bodies on the ground, actually and figuratively.    This is a serious work of fiction that makes demands on the reader, but persistence pays off. After reading some comments posted here, it's understandable to me that Franzen resisted the invitation of Oprah Winfrey to introduce The Corrections to her broad audience. The Corrections, which had elements of satire, escaped the ire of the know-nothings, but Freedom, a more earnest and formidable work, will not.
B002ZG97EC|5.0|I'm definitely over this ridiculous fad for 3D. I'm also over the Pixar-induced infatuation Hollywood seems to have with animated 'kidult\\" movies: predictably enough, even as the digital wizardry has continually popped eyes, story lines have proved ever more derivative, and great films, digital, 3D, or otherwise remain as elusive as ever. Most the recent digital cartoons including (universally feted but, in my contrarian opinion, overrated) Toy story 3 have been duds. So I had no great expectations of Despicable Me, particularly as its tag line (\\"super bad. Super dad\\") promised a dreary couple of hours.<br /><br />The first thing you notice about the film - or perhaps the last, seeing as it is only with the rolling of the credits that you realise what has caused this odd dissonance - is how French it is. Other than the voice actors, virtually every name on the credit roll is French.<br /><br />And that gives it, well, a je ne sais quoi (he says with a \\"pfft\\" and a Gallic shrug). Gru, the master villain, wears the sort of stylish scarf and a snappy zip-up turtle-neck that would simply never occur to a Californian. His house is a decaying Gothic mansion with a dead lawn, but live suburban Californian neighbours (no South Pacific atolls for this major criminal, but his inside space is still cavernous to say the least). Gru drives an ungainly rocket-powered car made of riveted steel that might be of [[ASIN:B0001IM98W Jules Verne's]] devising. And Gru - sardonic, ironic, eastern European Gru - is the hero of the film, not the villain: in tune with the modern world's acknowledgement that there is no good and bad, only 1001 different flavours of turpitude, Gru's quest is nothing more honourable than reclaiming the world's number 1 bad guy spot off some precocious young kid in a tracksuit.<br /><br />So a word about allegories.  I have seen a couple bandied about in cyber space, that this is a thinly disguised biopic about Microsoft and Apple - for said track suited adolescent \\"Vector\\", superimpose Bill Gates. And Vector certainly seems to have outdone the older, more complacent Gru, in every conceivable way (whilst being obsessed with a Squid Gun!). Yet, with Microsoft these days more or less an also-ran in the tech wars, it's difficult to see why this would be an interesting subject to explore. And it might jut as well be about Google versus Microsoft, or even Universal versus Pixar. But you do have a hunch that the Frenchmen are hinting at something darker than the nostalgic slapstick of, say, [[ASIN:B00075H6CS The Incredibles]]. There is something about this film's bearing that leads you (well, it led me, at any rate) to look for buried messages.<br /><br />As is the way of these post-modern comedies, the cultural references are legion, and the story itself is an imaginative (or perhaps random) welding together of [[ASIN:1600105807 Little Orphan Annie]], [[ASIN:0141187565 Moonraker]], the Incredibles and, in its way, [[ASIN:B0000560Y4 Wall Street]]: Gru's problems only start when he is turned down by his bankers for a loan to finance his latest dastardly enterprise. His bank: The Bank of Evil, of course. (Subtitled: \\"Formerly Lehman Brothers\\").<br /><br />What looked like a cheap shot had me thinking allegorically again (sorry: it's a weakness). I wonder whether it isn't technology, but capitalism itself, that is the Frenchmen's target. Something chimes about the parallels between the corporate and banking excesses of recent years which, as we remorsefully rehearse, sorely lacked social utility outside the enrichment of their perpetrators - and a hubristic and egotistical race to do something as pointless (and self-harming, as a poor werewolf discovers, mid-howl) as stealing the moon. The only motivation offered was \\"profit\\", with no explanation given for how any might accrue (which also rings rather true!)<br /><br />Certainly, the speech Gru gives to all his \\"minions\\" (semi-sentient little helpers who look like Advil capsules ingoggles and denim overalls:  he tells them to prepare their CVs) resembles Dick Fuld's supposed speech to his defeated troops after the battle of wall street in 2008, and the minions (half-witted automatons) do rather resemble aspiring investment bankers. The Lehman reference, perhaps, was not coincidental.<br /><br />So much for hubris: Gru's redemption is at the hands of three orphans whom he adopts for nefarious purposes, and in whose hands he makes his moral recovery. This is predictable, yes, and formulaic, yes, but nevertheless is handled deftly, with genuine inventiveness and the same sort of new parent's knowingness which infuses Pixar's output: Gru's irritation at the feebleness of the bedtime story he is required to read was visceral and very, very familiar to the audience, judging by their uproarious response. Brilliant.<br /><br />The 3D is used inventively (why no-one has ever thought to stage a rollercoaster ride in a 3D movie before is beyond me, but it works a treat) without ever being gratuitous. And I liked the incidental music too: other than the opening strains of Lynrd Skynrd (accompanying a stereotypically annoying family of American tourists: again, a deft little Gallic tweak) it is suave and, well, Continental.<br /><br />Others have carped that Despicable Me is saccharine: maybe it caught me on a good day but I didn't think so at all: I enjoyed every minute, and so did my kids (9 through 4), so from me it comes well recommended for all ages.<br /><br />Olly Buxtono prepare their CVs) resembles Dick Fuld's supposed speech to his defeated troops after the battle of wall street in 2008, and the minions (half-witted automatons) do rather resemble aspiring investment bankers.

B000JQUZCI|5.0|I recently read Frankenstein's Monster, and having reviewed that book, I decided to move on to the original.  I wish I had read this first, because it gave me more of a feel for what was happening in the sequel, but still, it was easy to read them out of order.<br /><br />The original book strikes me as more of a cautionary tale for wandering men of the time period!  It's hardly the \\"horror\\" story it turned into due to Hollywood magic.  It was horrific, but not a horror story as it evolved into.  It was a book about losing sight of what is important, about losing yourself to your passions, of redemption, of pain and longing, but really, the \\"horror\\" aspect of it is secondary in my mind.<br /><br />I tried desperately to figure out which character was the \\"bad guy,\\" but it turns out that there really wasn't one.  Frankenstein and his creation were both equally guilty and equally victims of each other.  I felt for both of them, and it was hard for me to think of the creation as a monster.  I was profoundly moved by his plight, but at the same time, I wondered that he could speak so eloquently and be moved by beauty, yet could commit such crimes and feel justified.  He was definitely torn, as was Victor Frankenstein.<br /><br />The style of writing and use of language is superb and I can't recommend it more highly.  If you hesitated because you thought of this as strictly \\"horror,\\" well, don't let Hollywood's butchering of this magnificent story deter you.  There is more here than meets the eye and it's worth the time to read it.

Maybe I need to listen to it a few more times but I feel like I am listening to some old newly released James Taylor songs here.

I love Michael Moore movies he gives the people the opportunity to wake up and see what is really happening around them. I hope he does one on 9/11, so we will know what really happened there, and who really illustrated it.

Great album! LP had the right to make this album!
B003U9V6A6|5.0|this album is better than the first album in so many ways.  The lyrics are deeper and the songs dont feel like filler at all.  Every song is face of the band and every face of the band is amazing.  I don't think i have ever come across a cd as passionate as this one.  You can't write lyrics like that without an experience to match and the experience on this cd is one to be taken!  I was blown away by their first album and this album blows the first album away!

B003Y5H4SO|4.0|The Review:<br /><br />Clocking in at only 80 minutes, the M. Knight Shyamalan produced Devil is a fast moving supernatural horror/suspense film, and one of the better film's baring Mr. Shyamalan's name in quite many years.  Five strangers, a mechanic, a guard, an old woman, a young woman and a salesman, are stuck in an elevator in a high rise office tower in Philadelphia.  Besides having to endure truly awful elevator music, there are intermittent power cuts that leave them all standing absolute darkness.  Oh, yeah, when the lights go out something or someone attacks them.  Their only link to the world outside is the elevator security camera and the people on the other side of that camera, including Philadelphia police detective Bowden.  The people trapped in the elevator can hear their observers, but their observers can only see, but not hear, them.  Each time the lights go out, the attacks get more and more violent.  It starts out as a loud noise and then someone gets cut.  From that point on every flicker of the elevator lights induces panic.  It's a great setup, and Devil's abbreviated length keeps this premise fresh where a longer film might have caused it to overstay its welcome.<br /><br />Any discussion of the plot of Devil treads dangerously close to spoiler territory as most of Devil's enjoyment stems from its who-done-it plot elements.  Discovering how these people come to be stuck in the elevator, how they are all connected and figuring out whom or what is attacking them in the dark encompasses most of the Devil experience.  Imagine if prior to seeing the Sixth Sense, The Usual Suspects or Se7en, someone told you how they ended or what the major plot reveal is, or worse if someone told you what the matrix was before you saw the Matrix?  Now Devil's big reveal or ending probably doesn't rate up there with The Usual Suspects', especially with a more sophisticated movie audience used to shock endings, or unexpected plot twists, but it did manage to keep me guessing until the end.  Based on that alone, I recommend seeing Devil.<br /><br />Strong performances by an ensemble cast, without any big name actors added to the film.  For a bit of the film, there's a sense that it could be any of us stuck in the elevator being terrorized by an unknown force.  As the story goes on though, you may be able to dissociate yourself because one of the plot elements is that ***SPOILER ALERT*** everyone in the elevator is a bad person, or a \\"sinner\\" for lack of a better term.  Who they are and what they did is part of why they find themselves tormented in an elevator dangling 20 stories. ***END SPOILER***<br /><br />In the end Devil succeeds in taking a simple premise, being stuck in an elevator with 4 strangers, and turns it into a great horror movie.  It feeds on the common fear of tight spaces and augments that fear by adding an element of terror that only comes when the lights go out, playing on our fears of the dark.  Devil is a solid horror film that should keep you guessing until the end.  I think I'll be taking the stairs whenever I can from now on.<br /><br />FTC Advisory: We purchased our own tickets.the end.  Based on that alone, I recommend seeing Devil.

B001HN69B8|3.0|You might know Parnassus from Mount Parnassus, a limestone mountain in central Greece in Dephi.  It was sacred to Apollo, the Corycian nymphs, and the home of the Muses. You might know Parnassus as the son of the nymph of Kleodora, the inventor of the art of foretelling the future from a flight of birds.  Or you might know Parnassus as Dr. Parnassus.  In which case half of The Imaginarium of Dr. Parnassus won't make sense at all.<br /><br />See, if you understand the mythological roots of Terry Gilliam's mid-life crisis movie, you understand there's all these birds, why the troupe dresses up as characters from Greek myth, and why the Imaginarium is a place of wonder, inspiration, and death.<br /><br />Doctor Parnassus' (Christopher Plummer) Imaginarium is housed in an anachronistic wagon that trolls through London's seedier districts. He leads a theatre troupe that includes leading man Anton (Andrew Garfield), diminutive advisor Percy (Verne Troyer), and Parnassus' cherubic daughter Valentina (Lily Cole). Their production blurs the line between performance and audience as unruly passersby crash into the stage and the Imaginarium, their souls put to the test of their own imaginations. Unsurprisingly, those of a petty disposition succumb to their worst urges and lose their souls to Mr. Nick (Tom Waits).<br /><br />There's a devil's deal between Parnassus, a sort of white man's Buddha, and Mr. Nick. Parnassus fell in love with a mortal girl and gave up his own immortality so that he may woo her.  Their union created Valentina, but there was a catch - the girl's soul is Nick's when she turns 16, and her birthday is just around the corner. But Nick is willing to cut another deal to free Valentina in a wager over who wins five souls first.<br /><br />Into this traditional tale of wisdom vs. temptation strays the Hanged Man in the awful guise of poor Heath Ledger.  Going by the name of Tony, the Hanged Man is a wild card.  He is a liar, a cheat, a thief, and a cad, but he is far more charming than Mr. Nick and far wiser in the ways of mankind than Parnassus.  He is humanity, given every gift and wasting it all to just for a few more seconds at the end of a rope that has yet to go taut.  The Hanged Man never realizes that the noose was never slack in the first place...until he reaches the end of the rope.<br /><br />Traditional moralistic notions of good and evil are absent here.  The Imaginarium is more Buddhist than Christian, and souls reach enlightenment by reveling in their own selfish natures.  Old Nick is hardly the demonic Satan; he is as much a counterbalance to Parnassus as he is a player in the great game of souls, far more interested in keeping the game's momentum moving forward than actually winning it. Unlike Nick, the Hanged Man keeps cheating death and thereby cheating on the Game, which is the greatest sin in the film's twisty ethos.<br /><br />The irony of Ledger playing a character constantly avoiding (and ultimately succumbing) to the noose is agonizing to watch and lends far more pathos than this self-indulgent film probably deserves.  It's a fine tribute to Ledger's life and death that in the imagination, three muses portray him (Johnny Depp, Jude Law, and Colin Farrell).  They are suave, slick, and vulgar respectively - but all devastatingly handsome in their own way.  Gilliam's film reaches new heights because of these reflections of Ledger, which are in turn reflections of Tony. It's truly a gift no director could ever want..

0307474712|4.0|A few of my best girlfriends and I decided to start a book club, and this was our first choice.  I really liked the idea of following a couple on the same exact day for 20 years.  The great thing about this book is that I think just about everyone can relate to it.  Most of us at one time or another have had a close relationship with someone whom we deeply loved but couldn't quite catch.  That makes the drama and the ups and downs of this relationship both touching and relatable.  Sometimes you want to shake Emma for hanging onto Dexter as he descends deeper into debauchery, but at the same time you know how she feels.  It's difficult to let go, but usually at some point we do.  Letting go is the lesson that both of them seem to learn throughout this 20 year journey.      The one thing keeping me from giving this book 5 stars is that it is a bit of a somber story that sort of sags a tad toward the middle.  There isn't much in the way of a climactic build up.  Also, it is very \\"British,\\" and the subtle humor may be a bit difficult for many Americans to understand.
B003XWEQ1G|4.0|This is yet another telling of the tale of Robin Hood.  However, this tale is one that relates how Robin Hood became an outlaw.  I enjoyed it very much.  But the real theme was the fight against the arrogance of leadership, most particularly that of King Edward of England.  I could not help myself from thinking how it reminded me of the arrogance of our current leadership in Washington with Obama, Reid and Pelosi ignoring the people's wishes because they either think they know better or because they must defeat dissidence by almost any subterfuge if it threatens their power.  The more their power is threatened the more arrogant and deceitful they become.  I am not limiting my observation to only Democrats but Republicans as well.  It just happens that our current leadership is principally Democrat and should bear the brunt of the American people's anger at this time.  Of course, the abuse of power is more sophisticated today than it was in the story of Robin Hood in 12th century England, but the amount of power is much greater today, particularly economic power.  So, what I thought was a very good movie, particularly the Russell Crowe portrayal of Robin Hood, which was similar to his role in Gladiator but without much of the sadness experienced by the character, it was somewhat disheartening because I was reminded that the world politics has not changed that much since the dark ages.  I only wish I could have viewed the film solely for its entertainment value without the reminders of deceit and arrogance of government.  Hopefully others can view the film without comparison to modern times.  Lastly, while this film may not be suitable for younger viewers, the graphic violence was less than what I have seen in films like this which should provide families with older kids with some good entertainment.
0307346609|3.0|After browsing through the 700 odd reviews and seeing so many singing this book's praises, I just had to give it a try.  Unfortunately it let me down a bit.  The idea is fantastic - interviewing survivors of the zombie apocalypse from around the world.  Many of these stories are quite engrossing and really hold your interest, while others fall flat and become repetitive.  The names of the characters are maddeningly foreign - to the point where you have to spend extra time trying to figure out exactly how the names of people and places are pronounced.  This makes the task of connecting with characters and storing them to memory difficult but necessary for when Brooks decides to go back to them later in the book.  I didn't even realize he was doing this until I was three-quarters of the way through and I had to wonder how many of the stories I'd read had been continuations of earlier ones.    Many reviewers have mentioned Brooks' political agenda, but I didn't walk away feeling anything was pushed on the reader.  If anything the book felt more \\"conservative\\" in it's stance than \\"liberal.\\"  The only time I could feel a bit of bias were the excerpts dealing with Pakastan and Israel, but even then it wasn't overblown.    I'm a life long horror fan, and zombies are one of my favorites because they actually manage to scare me.  I was hoping this book would be a fresh take on the subject and might actually give me goosebumps - didn't happen.  This book is more about the survivors than the zombies themselves but I would have prefered more \\"feeling\\" in the descriptions, that might have helped to bring the scare factor.  I enjoyed the idea of the story much more than the execution.  It had some really great moments, but there were also times I had difficulty concentrating which, for me, means...boredom.
B001RTSPVY|5.0|Bryan Cranston continues to revel in his second \\"role of a lifetime\\" - the first being Hal in the comic gem \\"Malcolm in the Middle,\\" and now as America's favorite beleaguered chemistry teacher, Walt White.  \\"Breaking Bad - Season 2\\" continues creator Vince Gilligan's magnificant exploration of how modern man fights back against fate.    A grim sense of foreboding stalks the second season of AMC's surprise hit show.  Each of the thirteen episodes starts with a brief prologue - often without any dialogue - that hints at the trials to come.  By far the creepiest of these scenes are the repeated shots of a jarringly pink teddy bear (the only part of these scenes shot in color - the rest of shots are in black-and-white) with one eye ripped from its socket floating in what looks like Walt's swimming pool, only to be swept up by a criminal investigatory team.  We have no idea whose teddy bear it is or how it got there - but it's clear that this can't be good news for Walt.     In many ways, Season 2 shows how Walt keeps jumping from the frying pan to safety, only to realize that he's landed on another frying pan.  He's still sick with cancer, and now he's coughing blood.  His product is still the best on the market, but the dealer connection he forged at the end of Season One is fraught with danger - Tuco is more than a bit unstable.  His sidekick Jesse continues to skirt just on the responsible side of ruin.  And his wife Skylar is getting both more pregnant and suspicious every day.      Can Walt stay healthy long enough to build a nest egg for his family?  Can he escape the casual, senseless death that takes so many drug dealers?  Can he continue to fly under the radar of his DEA-agent brother-in-law, who is unwittingly hunting for Walt in the guise of Heisenberg?  Can he keep the mounting lies straight?    All these questions provide for riveting, if grim, television.  Season Two is a profane and violent season, but it is one of the most intelligent and emotional seasons of TV we have seen in years.  Cheers to all concerned - this is must-see TV.
B003XQRZ7E|4.0|This is a great first album. The musicianship and song execution deserve a five. The strength of the songs and lyrics varies a lot more and I would give a four on average. Some of the lyrics feel like their really reaching to fill in some blanks (freak flag fly, mojo, etc...) but overall pretty good. The basic tracks were recorded in four days mostly \\"live in studio\\" and I think that adds to the feel in a good way. Unlike the other reviewer I really like Glenn Hughes vocals, especially on the rock-ier stuff as he has an edge that few vocalists get. I'm sure there will be \\"Dio\\" comparisons both favorable and unfavorable but he really has his own voice and they were peers. Joe sings lead on several songs as well. I have to admit I saw Trapeze in the Cotton Bowl in '75 and I thought they were better than the Stones, Eagles and Montrose that day, so you can count me as a long time fan. I also must confess that I have been following Joe since 2003 and I'm a huge fan there as well with all albums and I see him every time he's in Colorado. Jason is an amazing drummer and Derek Sherinian is excellent on keyboards although not as present in all of the mixes as the others, which tends to happen with keys in guitar oriented blues-rock bands.       The opening track \\"Black Country\\" comes out with all guns blazing and could be the hardest rocker. I loved it instantly, which rarely happens. Most of the rest are mid-paced rockers. Stand out tracks to me are \\"One Last Soul\\", \\"Beggarman\\" (which has a very interesting string bending riff), \\"Song of Yesterday\\" and \\"Medusa\\". I have had it a week and listened several times and feel like it has grown on me with each listen. I can easily listen to the album all the way through, which is more than I can say about many album purchases that only have one or two songs that I like.
B001GCUER0|5.0|AMC has come out of nowhere to challenge HBO as the leading producer of quality original programming on TV.  While the roster of hits may not be as deep as HBO's, \\"Breaking Bad\\" and \\"Mad Men\\" belong on the short list of Great TV Series from the last two decades.      With Season Two, \\"Mad Men\\" builds on the stellar foundation laid by Season One.  I'll leave the recapping of the tale to others, but I will say that the deeper exploration of the characters of \\"Mad Men\\" is a worthwhile enterprise.      \\"Mad Men\\" starts and stops with Don Draper - just who the heck is he?  The perfection of the man's profile is only exceeded by his life - gorgeous dutiful wife, the requisite number of kids, the ability to bag almost any woman he sees, and command of his job.  What more can a man in the early 60s ask for?  But it's clear that behind that stoic demeanor and clenched jaw there is a seething mass of rage and uncertainty - Don is not as ice-cold as his icy stare would indicate.    Sure, there's lots of fun to be had with the time period - we get to see \\"new\\" products such as Clearasil and the Kodak slide carousel along with the period-appropriate womanizing, boozing, and fashion.  But \\"Mad Men\\" is far more than an observant time capsule of a bygone era.  It is an exploration of the men and women who lived seemingly perfect lives but were all too flawed and human inside the armor of their movie-star looks and their Manhattan cool.      Season Two wanders pretty far afield as we learn the Story of Don, and it's a fun wandering.  Try to avoid spoilers where you can, and enjoy the ride.
0811870413|3.0|You'll probably never make bread from this...    I know, I won't. It presents one of those complicated methods where you make you own starter, discard parts of it, feed it, etc. I think it takes about five days before you're even able to think about baking a loaf of bread! There are lots of photos (black and white) instructing you how to make the bread but those photos make it an even more dissuading process to me.    The story of the bread is interesting, as are the stories of people whom they followed who attempted to bake the bread. (One of them owns a restaurant, so if you do, the book may be for you.) The highlight of the book are the recipes for what to do with leftover bread. These are accompanied with nice color photos. There are many good ideas here, like Nicoise Pan Bagnat (a pressed sandwich filled with tuna and olives); Banh-Mi, a Vietnamese sandwich with pickled vegetables, green (cilantro) aioli, garlic fish sauce; panade (a savory pie made with root vegetables, smoked meat, cheese, and layers of bread).  There are also more familiar recipes like meatball sandwiches and onion soup.    There are many variations on the basic bread, which you could adapt for your favorite bread recipe, but not the one in this booK!    For my money, and realistic bread baking, I'd chose other books like My Bread by Jim Lahey and 200 Fast and Easy Artisan Breads by Judith Fertig. While both of these books include recipes with longer rising periods (overnight) they are still simple to make, and both books include recipes for bread which you can actually make on the same day.    Before buying this book, I'd look at a copy of it at the library or in a book store first.

1441866868|4.0|The Windup Girl comes on 16 CDs, each of which is divided into 100 tracks.  This makes it easy to keep track of where you are in case you stop listening.      The actor who reads the story has a great voice, as you'd expect given his previous credits.  He manages to give the different main characters different styles of speaking, which makes it easier to keep them straight.  He controls the speed of the narrative very well.  The content is a little adult.  I wouldn't give it to anyone younger than 14, but your mileage may vary.     The story does a great job of conjuring up a not-too-distant future in Thailand, where energy is the new currency.  The good guy has a mysterious backstory and the secondary characters are nicely fleshed out.  I don't want to give away any part of the story (I'm sure others will), since part of the delight of this production is listening to it naively and being sucked into the atmosphere.  Surprisingly, I've enjoyed listening to several disks twice and realized I missed some of the layers of characterization that are in the text.      Why not five stars?  I'm not sure the story is my all-time favorite, and there's an annoying voice that tells you to switch disks.  I did like the few minutes of commentary, although that should not be a major selling point of this set.
0345505387|2.0|I too like the Outlander series, but didn't care for this book. It is a comic book, not a novel. I wish Gabaldon would not have spent time on this when she could have been writing the next Outlander book, but that's just me.
B0030Y10QQ|2.0|to lead or write a full length release.  Then Jon backed off from vocal duties.   I really had hoped that after Hall, the band could continue to rock and get away from the story telling / prog metal, but they can't.  Wake of Mag is the biggest let down and while I do like some of the Live Japan, it still is weak because of the vocal's by Zac.   I still like to listen to Dungeons,  Sirens and Hall.  But after that, the sound / quality goes down.
0316098337|4.0|Imagine being locked in an eleven by eleven garden shed with your mom.  Your captor is a mysterious man who you've nicknamed Old Nick. He appears in the night to rape your mother while you're shut in the closet. You eat whatever canned food and scraps your mom can beg from him. You've never been outside of this room in your life.  Now imagine this scenario through the eyes of a spirited five year old.  And through your mother's fierce love, you only know a packed routine filled with songs and games.  That's the paradox of Emma Donahue's Room.  Through this daring and layered story, we see this bleak life both through the eyes of an imaginative five year old, Jack, and with our perspective.  So we see both the wonder and the horrific situation Jack and his Ma are in.<br /><br />The premise of Room promises to break your heart, which it does--hundreds of times.  But Jack's lively voice is strangely optimistic, and so his story becomes both repulsive and addictive. Donahue has built a scarily believable world for her characters. Room stretches the power of fiction, and it is unlike anything I've ever read.  Room is the most unforgettable book to come along in a decade.
B000002UHG|2.0|I had read an interview with Richard Wright on the internet talking about this album and reading other reviews I was curious to hear it.  I ordered this cd here on Amazon being real excited to hear it.  I pulled out the cd again recently and the album is not as good as I remembered it.  The album is a theme on clinical depression.  Something that Rick's future wife was going through.  Most of this album is slow, dark and moody.  Too me a lot of it is very boring.  The only 2 songs I really liked on this album was Night Of A Thousand Fury Toys and Along The Shorline.  Those 2 are the most upbeat but the rest is slow and draggy.  This does have a Pink Floyd sound to it.  Sounding very similar at times to The Division Bell only not nearly as good.  If you are into slow at times ambient keyboard driven music this might be your thing but if you're looking for something that has a good bite to it stear clear and just pick up The Division Bell instead if you don't have it.  Most of these songs don't really go anywhere on this.  they just sound flat and lifeless.  Also Sinead 'O Conner singing on this really doesen't help the album much.  I have heard years before Richard Wright's death he was working on a 3rd solo album.  Weather that will be released or not I'm not sure but as of right now this is his latest and so far last release not counting his contibutions on the David Gilmour albums.

142314189X|5.0|This set is packaged nicely. I got one for my nephew and my neighbor kid and then for myself. As others have said, it does start off \\"kiddish\\". If this is for a young person who is looking for an adventure story, it's great. I'd say it's somewhere between \\"Lord of the Rings\\" and \\"Harry Potter\\" in style and sentiment. It is not written as well as these other series but it is also not as difficult to read. DO NOT SEE THE MOVIE FIRST! The movie almost nothing like the books and nowhere near as good. Also, this is not a series for the fans of \\"Twilight\\". The romance in this only barely begins to blossom in the fourth (out of five) book. These books do make me laugh aloud. I like that. Lots of icky monsters and some gore.
B0032JTV74|2.0|That Glee is one of the best TV shows ever and will become a classic goes without saying.  Anything that has to do with the show I give five stars and then some. All the more reason for Fox to have exercised significantly greater care in issuing the blu-ray/dvd product.  It is very irritating to come across so poorly designed and executed product.  Here are some points I find irritating:<br /><br />1/ There is no printed episode guide.  Furthermore, episode names or numbers are not listed on the disc covers.  A well designed product would have included a printed episode guide, ideally with the name of the \\"guest\\" star, if any, included.<br />To find out what is included in say, disc 3, one has to play the disc. BAD BAD BAD.<br /><br />2/ Fox has been stingy and the blu-ray image has suffered.  They should have spread the season over FIVE discs to avoid the necessity of super-compression.  As a result, colors are not as vibrant nor detail as fine as one would have expected from a prime show such as this.<br /><br />3/ The sound would have been fine for any other show..... for Glee one expected something spectacular like blu-ray can deliver.  I have a splendid home theatre system.  The box says sound is \\"5.1dts HD Master Audio\\"  .... well, my system would really like to know for it all seems to come from the front...not even a bird tweeting from the sides.<br /><br />So praises to writers, cast, musicians, everyone who has anything to do with the SHOW.  Damnation to all those who produced this sub-par blu-ray.  What will they do about it..... issue some new edition and expect us to dish out more cash for it?<br />Shameful.
B003EYVY0E|1.0|First time I saw the first two movies were the extended ultimate editions.  Waited for next 2 and was extremely disappointed that they will not be extended.  Well I ordered the other 4 movies on regular blu-ray instead of waiting forever to see if next #5 & 6 will be extended.  They screwed up like the evil idiots who won't release Lord of the Rings extended on blu-ray until they rape the consumers with theatrical versions.  Movie itself wasn't to bad, but I've never read or have the time or inclination to read the books, so extended is nice for background info.

B001R6D7I8|5.0|I have not read the book yet but have seen the movie. I anticipate a great story.
038533348X|3.0|Before Cat's Cradle, I had read Slaughterhouse Five and Breakfast of Champions, both of which had a more humorous tone to them, so when I bought this, I thought it was going to be more of the same. In that sense, I was disappointed with the book, since it turned out to have a mostly serious tone to it.<br /><br />Cat's Cradle, in my experience, is Vonnegut's most lauded novel, but I did not enjoy it as much as the other two I've read. It seemed like the story never moved--like every major plot point was just the precursor to something that never happened. It felt like just the opening chapters to a much longer novel.<br /><br />However, with all that said, it is very readable. Any fan of Vonnegut will love this book. Perhaps my assumptions about the book soured the experience for me (and for this reason I will eventually reread it), but in any case, I'd recommend it to any fans of literature.
1416589473|5.0|If you like the Guild Wars storyline or if you just like medieval, sci-fi, you'll like this book. It has a great story and is well written; it is easy to picture the events and places. This is definitely one of the only books I have found interesting enough to read again. I don't want to waste time on this review summarizing the plot-sense its on the back of the book, but I will say the only downside to this book is its length. I wish there was more to read because every time I would open it up I couldn't put it down until I realized how much I was reading; I was trying to space out the book to make it last longer. I recommend this to anyone interested in it, and I can't wait to read the second book in the series when it comes out.

140120841X|5.0|The beginning suggests a unique and possibly unconventional narrative: \\"Good evening, London. It's nine o'clock and this is the Voice of Fate broadcasting on 275 and 285 in the medium wave...it is the fifth of the eleventh, nineteen-ninety-seven.\\" A panel depicting a state-controlled factory, with perhaps one of many security cameras perched high on a lamp pole, immediately follows it. \\"For your protection,\\" it says underneath the camera in stark black mocking letters.     Like in Watchmen, Alan Moore doesn't waste time getting into the universe surrounding the story. And every panel has its purpose here, whether it be seemingly pertinent or not, flavor material or pure narrative motion. He doesn't pass up on a chance to speak about the characters or this `past-future' world with every single crucial detail of art here. When V, as he is called and nothing else, goes about an initially unknown activity that leads to a shock bombing of the Parliament houses punctuated by a great tumult of striking pyrotechnics, we are there with him and in that way Alan brings us into his created world like no other comic writer does.    Evey knows she doesn't have a choice in this world but to provide some services of the lewd kind; approaching a man whom she doesn't take for much of a Fingerman (the equivalent of a policeman in this fascist ruled society) and gets into very hot soup because of it.  After near-death, she has to bear the brunt of being taken in by V, whom we find out very soon to be a rather delicate, if very bizarre caretaker of sorts. The fabric surfaces more, with The Leader running things, coordinating an initiative to take down V for decreed revenge. The underlying system of this graphic novel seems contradictory to the claim that Watchmen was far more elaborate than what lies on the English-comic-strip-styled pages of V for Vendetta. Alan certainly doesn't lose a beat here, cementing the work with poetic prose.     Although terribly organic, an absorbing foray into the bleak nature of some of the more deviant characters, which although juxtaposed against an overt totalitarian form of government, grinds into the nominal truths of human nature. Reverend Anthony Lilliman would be a perfect example of morally pure externals overlapping wicked and sinful internals. After delivering an all-inspiring acclamation, he sees fit to indulge in a little sinful fornication. Alan doesn't tone down on the small, minute allegories.       The most amazing thing, perhaps, is the polished readability of this immensely British story (most prominent in the way women behave in this story for example) in today's modern times. It bears no disappointment as to the degree of quality it precedes as well (Alan was doing Swamp Thing while he was working on V), and it may even be passed off as a work of elaborate literature, albeit in the graphic form, a work surpassed by few graphic novels of its kind.

1601251556|4.0|This mat fulfills all your dry/wet erase marker needs. Its durable , perfectly scaled in 1 inch squares and for a semblance of variety the flip side is more sandy colored. As a long time DM i pulled this mat out to my group of 3 new players and it instantly changed the game for them. Now instead of waiting on me to find a scrap paper to doodle on I whip out the marker and instantly sketch . One player actually noted that the game felt more real now that we were using the flip.     The only complain is that factory folding leaves it slightly bent at the creases but most of this can be combated by leaving several heavy books on it for a while. All in all this is a simple yet well constructed game aid for any role playing game.
B00361DR4Q|4.0|There's no question that this version of La Traviata for the Teatro alla Scala is a quality production on many levels and, available at a budget price, the Blu-ray is nevertheless of a very high standard, but I have a few minor reservations, mainly around the lack of any sense of adventure in the staging.  It's a safe production with a perfectly traditional staging, unimaginatively presented and choreographed, with little to distinguish it from countless other productions of the opera available.    It's harder to be critical of the actual performance on any other level than that of personal taste and Angela Gheorghiu doesn't sit well with me.  There's no doubting her technical ability, the sheer control or the strength of her voice, but personally, I find it a little mannered, and I would say the same about her acting.  As a result, her Violetta never feels as fragile or as vulnerable as she ought to be - at least from what I would expect of the role.  There's no chemistry whatsoever either with the otherwise fine Ramon Vargas as Alfredo, making this production technically strong, but emotionally weak.     By way of comparison, I find the Willy Decker staging of the opera for the [[ASIN:B001MRMRS8 2005 Salzburg Festspiele La Traviata]] much more interesting and innovative.  A rather minimalist staging, there is however great originality in how it makes the story meaningful, vital and contemporary (whereas this version feels a little bit stuffy and practically like a museum piece by comparison), drawing out all the latent passion and violence out of what should indeed be a highly charged opera.  While the question of who is the better singer is certainly debatable, it's one of Anna Netrebko's best performances and her acting seems better fitted to this particular role, blending perfectly and credibly with Rolando Villazón and a superb Thomas Hampson.    This version however is certainly a strong, all-round production, with fine performances and, particularly at thecurrent price, it is an excellent introduction to opera on Blu-ray, as well as appealing to traditionalists and fans of Gheorghiu.  There are however more exciting and daring versions around for anyone a little more adventurous.

B003XQRZ7E|4.0|It seemed like a great idea when Joe first mentioned he was putting together a band with Glenn Hughes, Jason Bonham, and Derek Sherinian.  Glad it paid off six months later!  The music starts off very fast in the first song, but calms down during the rest of the album.  Don't get me wrong though, a lot of the songs are still fast, but if you just listened to the first one, it gives you a false impression of the whole album.  Glenn sings about 75% of the songs here, but the songs with Joe and Glenn are definite standouts, along with the single \\"One Last Soul\\" and \\"The Great Divide.\\"  Speaking of \\"The Great Divide,\\" the DVD portion includes a studio performance of this song, and two soundboard quality videos of the concert in Riverside, CA where he first brought out Glenn Hughes.  The version of \\"Mistreated\\" is amazing, and now replaces my old favorite version of this song from the Rainbow album \\"On Stage.\\"  This release was timed perfectly to coincide with Joe's upcoming tour in November after his European stop.  Hopefully, he will include some songs from this album on his setlist, (and maybe bring Glenn along again as a special guest).  Here's to this band staying together for at least five years.  I know Glenn is up there in age, but most other singers from the 70's really have lost it nowadays, so hopefully this project can round out Glenn's career while helping Joe to another milestone in his amazing career so far at 33 years of age!  Congratulations to everyone involved on this project, but it really could have only worked with people like Bonamassa and Hughes at the helm.  Take any other virtuoso guitarist and most of the other ego-driven singers of yesteryear, and they wouldn't have been able to pull this off.  Joe Bonamassa, Glenn Hughes, Jason Bonham, and Derek Sherinian are all class acts.
006145205X|3.0|Review of \\"The Rational Optimist\\" by Matt Ridley<br /><br />Disclaimer: I am reviewing an advance unproofread copy I received for free through the Vine<br />program.<br /><br />I have enjoyed some of the author's previous books, like \\"The Red Queen\\". And I think I'm someone who's naturally supposed to love this book. I do like it, but I keep feeling some reservations...... Basically the book goes through human history, kind of from an economist's perspective this time, reiterating its support for optimism about progress, supported by lots of statistics (and indeed, evolution is probably best understood through statistics, as traits propagate statistically through populations).<br /><br />One of his key points is that we are making such progress because of specialization -- individually as consumers we receive the services of everyone who came before us, and invented/designed/thought of everything we use, and in return, we just have to produce/provide one thing well, each of us.<br /><br />Also he points out that all this was inevitable once \\"ideas began having sex\\", which is kind of his version of Dawkins' \\"memes\\".<br /><br />Yet I can't help but think of the disclaimer in financial prospectuses, \\"Past performance is no guarantee of future results\\" ...<br /><br />Overall the book is trying to reassure us, we've (humanity) pulled through every crisis in the past, so we're likely to pull through any upcoming ones as well. But I still feel slightly uneasy as if it's going to provide fodder for the \\"why worry?\\" crowd, the climate change deniers etc. as if it's going to be used in arguments against trying to solve any particular problem.<br /><br />So in that respect, although it's a good book full of good intention, the way it's oriented and packaged may be dangerous and counterproductive and end up proving itself wrong, at least in the short run.<br /><br />(yes the human race has always survived all sorts of calamities and severe bottlenecks, but do we really want to go through some of those bottlenecks again, seeing many people die unnecessarily, or seeing mass extinctions of other animals and plants, etc.?)<br /><br />I mean, we avoided some of the worst consequences foretold in \\"Silent Spring\\", but that's largely because Rachel Carson wrote the book and warned us, so we could take actions to course-correct. (same for \\"1984\\", \\"Brave New World\\" etc., we've kind of avoided their dystopian nightmares for the most part, largely because we've read the books and know what to watch out for!). I feel as though if we were to follow Matt Ridley's advice, maybe the future \\"Silent Spring\\"'s won't get written, and we'll go through some unnecessarily bad times -- we'll (humanity) pull through eventually, but at what unnecessary cost?<br /><br />Reading some of the other reviews, I see (but I didn't previously realize) that the author is actually already known as an \\"anti-environmentalist\\", which explains a lot of the things that bother me in the book.<br /><br />So I guess if you can get past the author's anti-environmentalism, then you can get some other good things out of it.e unnecessarily, or seeing mass extinctions of other animals and plants, etc.?)

B001FBSMF8|1.0|I am not really a Soundgarden fan or a big Chris Cornell fan. I liked \\"Badmotorfinger\\" and the first Audioslave record as well as \\"Hunger strike\\". This is about me Not this album! I always though Chris Cornell had a great voice and checked this out to see what he he was up to. He's a talented guy! I was into the party bands as well as the heavy metal 80's style bands at the time of Soundgarden. Now I on to \\"Scream\\", and I go in for the kill! Soundgarden and all Chris Cornell's projects may be good but I feel they are dated. For instance, The music is depressing and droll and had it's time, No fun to it. So it doesn't pass on to other generations looking to bring the fun back to music. However Chris is still a great singer and songwriter not on this album. It's Not all his fault but at least half. Now on to Timberland, who this review is really about and should be about! I think Timberland is an amazing talent! The Work he did with Artists such as; Nelly Furtado, and \\"One Rebublic\\", was outstanding! On this project both Chris and Timberland fall on their butts. Sorry I said it that way but I don't know another way to put it! The songs by Timberland and Chris are well written, as expected. The Music is horrible considering the artist involved and both producer and artists either went in over their heads or threw caution to the wind as well this atrocity of a recording! I am sorry to die hard Soundgarden Chris Cornell fans, this album may seem embarrassing to you guys! This Album called \\"Scream\\" is an R n'B album with Techno flavorings here and there. It's funny at times Chris or the Album sounds as if Timberland was trying to make a Michael Jackson(RIP), album. Chris even sounds like Michael on a few tracks. It doesn't make much sense to me or will it to you. Effort was put into this Chris wanted to escape the Mid-ninety's grunge trappings. However this instant bargain bin stuff from a former Rock artist who took a chance. Fans although you may really want to don't give up on Chris, he'll do better!
B002SSUQFG|4.0|This thing is brilliant. Only complaint is, I had to get a replacement from Amazon, who was extremely nice about it. More about that later...<br /><br />The SNK809 series movement is 7s26b. Yep, it's Seiko's famous fully-mechanical movement, designed to be (1) accurate and (2) dirt-cheap to manufacture. Accuracy-wise, it keeps its own against mechanical watches twenty times the price. How'd they do it? The 7s26b is an in-house Seiko design. It's gems are functional, the gears are unpolished, two of the rarely-used gears are even plastic! That's right, this movement doesn't put up airs. It's gonna do its thing. Absurdly well, for the price! Sorry if I sound flippant, but this is really cool!<br /><br />If you don't like the band, you can get it replaced. Not everyone would like a leather/more expensive band, and it adds to the initial cost. This is dirt-cheap for a mechanical watch-- once its YOUR mechanical watch, you can mix and match! Capitalism is fun!<br /><br />One thing! The mainspring doesn't rotate freely. If you watch the clear back as you move the watch around smoothly, the weight won't move around smoothly. This is important, because the first one I ordered basically wouldn't move. It wouldn't charge. I pissed off no fewer than five strangers who asked for the time. I guess the mainspring was defective, or one of the Seiko robots resented its fleshy human masters. Anyhow, the folks at Amazon were very nice and sent me a replacement, and this one works great.<br /><br />What's in the future? The SNK809 series has been discontinued by Seiko. Its successor is the SNKH63 series, feat. the same movement, with modified cosmetics and 20mm lugs. I like the snk809 better. That's why I bought it! Get it while you can. Unless you don't want to, in which case why did you read my review to the end? Get back to work! :)
B003MZ0I84|5.0|This album is frankly solid from top to bottom, without being any heavy.<br />It's the way Mutt Lange was able to convey all of their nuances into efficaciousness, without compromising their special talent, which is the uncanny ability to create amazing pop melodies that seem easy, while in fact are more timeless.<br />The skill of Adam Levine in singing about love life has reached peaks of vocal expressivity in this record.<br />If one pays attention to each song, you pretty much listen and properly view a unique story of lovers, that doesn't end well, but shows all the colors of a true life.<br /><br />It's their best album to date.<br /><br />Overlooking it may just make you miss the only decent thing that's left in pop-rock currently.
B002N1AEN2|2.0|I believe this disc to be highly overrated. I would classify The xx as chill-pop, or as a previous reviewer has put it, almost easy listening! I am actually finding it difficult to ascertain whether this was intended or merely incidental, to be honest. The best aspect of the record is the production; it is spacious and effectively allows for the interchange of the two vocalists. Unfortunately, however, the lyrics are insipid, cliche and predictable. The choice of making them somewhat central to the band's modus operandi completely ruins what they are trying to achieve, and ultimately makes xx a failure.
030726999X|2.0|I bought this book because it was rated high by other readers.  I, however, could not get into the book because of the many characters with difficult to prounounce names brought in without explanation as to who they are.  I gave up after 67 pages!!
B000O8OTNC|5.0|The compact size definitely drew me to this product. This is an amazing and very very effective sharpener. It's so simple to use and our super dull blades (including serrated) were like new razors. Here's the kicker: it took me less than 10 minutes to work nearly two dozen kitchen, utility, and camping knives. This would have taken me hours with a sharpening stone (and I'd likely ruin them).<br /><br />get this. period.
B00386EZJU|5.0|Out of my whole collection of soundtracks, this is one of my favorites. The music is just incredible. When you listen to it, you can feel the emotion in the music, which makes listening to it a joy.  John Powell did an incredible job matching the music to the spirit of the movie. When you play this CD, you will feel the energetic spirit that we all love, yet rarely hear in music. Tracks like \\"Romantic flight,\\" \\"This is Berk,\\" \\"New Tail,\\" and my personal favorite: \\"Test Drive\\" will leave you with daydreams of soaring. Buy this, you will not be dissapointed.
0061703087|4.0|I read this book this past summer on vacation. I liked it. The content is pure Crichton in it's detailed description of the science and technology behind the story. I found it to be a \\"page turner\\". It was a fast read, I finished it in about a week, and it made for great summer vacation reading.
B003QCCS36|5.0|I've been a fan of Ray lamontagne for a couple of years. Other than the steel guitar, I love this album. Very melow and the vocals are his strongest ever.
B002VECLVO|5.0|Very moving film, had already seen it in theatre.  Loved the story, the whole look of the film, very glamourous, vintage sixties, Colin Firth, great and sexy in the film.
0316017922|4.0|There have been a number of reviews for this book so I think I will just focus on the main long term actionable item I got out of this book. Summing up the book in my words: There are so many variables for \\"success\\". First is your definition of success. There are factors out of your control such as when you were born, where you live and all that entails (culture, geography). The factors you can control such as hard work, the time you decide to dedicate to a certain field. Of course most of these items can be obvious. The main thing I got out of the book was this. Children in grade school, middle school and high school that take summers off lose a little ground each year compared to those that don't. In order to combat that effect you should keep them working on those areas important to you over the summer. I am guessing the same would apply to college students.    Now for my own advice in this area based on my experience. You can have children work on these things in grade school and mostly in middle school but by the time they are in high school if they want to fight you on this \\"extra\\" work over the summer they probably will succeed in thwarting your attempts. Also don't try and cover every subject. Choose 1-3 subjects. That said I choose to focus on math as in my opinion it can be a weak area in public education and is so necessary for many fields. I have seen children that would probably would have been weak in math considered the \\"smart\\" math kids. I also attribute in one case the raising of state exam score by 10 points in 1 year to the extra work was done over the summer. If you decide you want to do this I would recommend the Saxon math books as they are excellent.
0451228375|4.0|This is not Ken Follet at his apex.  While Worlds is a good book, it was not the eye-opener that Pillars of the Earth was.  Pillars taught the reader what a brutal place the world was at that point in time.  Worlds ran more along the lines of a soap opera.  While I did learn some new details by reading it,to much time was devoted to the characters either attempting to live their simple lives despite the interference and cruelty of the Earl, or a few select characters posturing and scheming for a little additional power to wield over the populace.  I enjoy Follett's work more when he enlightens me to how life is lived in another era.
1416511946|5.0|Whether or not you like Nikki Sixx and/or Motley Crue, this book is a must read. It was impossible to put down. It's an inside the scenes glimpse of the life of an addict, a rock star, and the ups and downs that go with each. The book consists of the actual diary entries Nikki made in 1987 during the recording and touring of the Girls Girls Girls album mixed with current responses/thoughts to his entries. This includes not only Nikki's responses but those of the actual people he was writing about (including, but not limited to other Crue members, Vanity, Slash, etc). Nikki is brutally honest in regard his struggles with addiction and what life was like for him in those days. This is a well written book that made me feel that I was right there with him in 1987. Highly recommended!!!
1416972250|5.0|Absolutely wonderful!  Best book in the series, mainly because there are finally answers to the many questions asked in the first 2 books.  And finally, FINALLY, we have Clary and Jace's relationship clarified and resolved. I have to say, the plot twist with their relationship in the first book was very frustrating and I just couldnt bring myself to believe it, so when the truth was finally revealed I was extremely happy.   I don't want to go into too much detail, but I loved everything about this book, all the storylines and twists, the characters were, once again, superb!  I think the epilogue was a great way to end the series, or this half of it anyway.  I am very much looking forward to the sequel trilogy to this series.  I also recommend the first book of the prequel trilogy, Clockwork Angel.  It will leave you hungry for more of the shadowhunter universe, and asking many more questions.
0451228375|4.0|Pros:  *Ken Follett is an AMAZING storyteller  *He pays close attention to detail  *Introduces ideas and later reveals their purposes    Cons:  *Author seems to have an obsession with sex and rape (repeated themes from Pillars of the Earth)  *Author frequently uses vulgar slang to describe the female anatomy  *Author is at times repetitive
1416955070|5.0|I absolutely loved this book and the whole series!  I actually saw an ad for this book when it was first being released but when I read what it was about I thought it sounded too complicated.  Then someone at work, who loves the same books I do was reading it and said it was really good.  I decided to give it a try and boy, am I glad I did. I dont want to give away any spoilers but The stroyline is great, nothing like Ive ever read before.  The characters are awesome.  The only negative thig I have to say is that sometimes the language borders on \\"Dawson's Creek\\" rediculous.  These 16 and 17 yr olds are saying things no teenager would.  But the great story helped me get past the sometimes annoying language.     Awesome beginning to an awesome series : )
0439023513|5.0|Each book continues to build on the last by adding more depth and suspence.  I couldn't imagine how the author could possibly add even more suspence to the last book, but she did.  WOW, did she.  I hated for it to end.
B002ZG97E2|5.0|GREAT GREAT GREA GREAT MOVIE!!! If you ask me waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaay better than ANY pixar movie I've seen!
B003TML0VO|1.0|Just seeing Chris Daughtry included was a major clue.    Using \\"greatest guitar classics\\" in the title and then having Def Leppard and T Rex and Credence!!?!??  Are we just talking about some memorable chord sequences? Gimme a break.    Photograph is just awful [as is anything/everything Daughtry tries to sing].    There are some clever workings with 'guitar weeps' but as a whole this is a colossal failure.    This sounds more like a \\"just OK\\" cover band than anything else, which is really sad because I love Santana.
B0017KIBAI|5.0|I don't play on the wii, so I know nothing about it, but my boys frequently use this controller and enjoy it.
B0021L8V1G|5.0|I don't know why people comment on this with such opinionated reviews, in my personal opinion, it was great. But now let me give a more valid description. If you watched the first one, this is a good sequel explaining the missing details in the first one, and bringing it along, enhancing the underlying plot with Samuel Jackson and the league. It can get slow at times, but when action comes in, it PACKS in. With moderate violence, and other elements, it is not necesseraly a movie for younger kids not in their teens. Although, in certain families, it might be appropriate according to the rules of the house. With the plot, it becomes both a personal vendetta, and a redeeming love for starks father. When the twist comes, and once again as in the first one, the general enemy's of stark turn against each other, it really brings up the climax, peaking with the final chase, and slowly accelerating until the final moments of the movie. Although it comes to a quick conclusion, this is a worthwhile watch, and if it's in your tastes, buy it. If not, then don't. It simply comes to that.
B002ZG98Z0|5.0|In my opinion Sex and the City 2 are for those people who grew up (for lack of better words) watching the non-sanitized version of the Sex and the City series on HBO (as opposed to the squeaky clean edited version seen on other stations - Was Samantha even on the show?). The first movie, in my opinion, was depressing. The second movie, was fun! Take the scene where bathtub time with the children become a wet t-shirt contest? Now that's classic Sex and the City! And while Carrie was characteristically immature in this movie (What husband doesn't want to relax and watch television at home instead of going out to some shindig?), Miranda was fun! In fact, did she not wear the BEST dress in the entire movie(Yes, I'm talking about the dress she wore to Stanford and Anthony's wedding)? Charlotte was realistic! What mother doesn't want some time off from her children? And Samantha was just being Samantha! What theater didn't break out in laughter and applause when Samantha unabashedly confronted the men in the market? Sex and the City 2 is CLASSIC Sex and the City. It gave us everything that was sorely missing in the first movie. The laughter and the fun and the friendship between Carrie and her gal pals! As opposed to Carrie and her assistant Louise (although I love Jennifer Hudson's performance in the movie). And their exit out of the lavish hotel - Did that not remind you of that episode in the series when Samantha pretended to be someone else so they could all (the girls and Stanford)go hang out and get some rays at the rooftop pool of some exclusive club in the city before promptly getting kicked out? Yes, if you love everything about Sex and the City, the good, the bad, and the ugly, you will surely enjoy this movie!
1401310400|4.0|hi -i watch the show castle- and like it -so i tried the book- it was a fun read-it was and smart-sexy  and of course had beckett and rook trying to solve a crime  liked it a lot
0385335997|4.0|Voyager is by far the best book in the Outlander series. It is action packed and full of romance at the same time. The only drawback is the length but this is almost expected from Galbadon.
B003TML0VO|1.0|Total and utter crap. Don;t waste your time or money on this one. I wrote an extended review here: Associated Content[...]<br /><br />I'm a long time Santana fan and had high hopes for this one given its subject of guitar classics but I was actually angry after listening to it.
0060558121|5.0|This novel was absolutely awesome!  What more can I say?  At first I was a little hesitant about reading this because I really didn't love Neverwhere.  I thought it was too Lord of the Ring-y for me.  Fantasy is not my cup of tea.  I decided to get it based on all the great reviews here on amazon.<br /><br />And wow.  I really, really LOVED this book.  Not only was it entertaining, but I feel like I learned something.  About gods and other mythical beings.  I think that's really cool.  The plot:  Shadow, basically a normal guy who just gets out of prison, agrees to work for Wednesday.  They drive around alot, talk about the \\"storm\\" a-brewin' and run into old \\"friends.\\"  There's nice little interludes, or stories about people that you won't exactly meet in the novel, but it goes with the novel.  I hope you know what I mean.  Or you will when you read it.  Cause you gotta read it.  I thought they were interesting.  There were twists and turns and drama.  And in the end everything is tied up nice and tightly.  I read some of the one star reviews and they mention the book is boring?  And there's too much going on?  BORING?!  My GOD!  (Would that be considered a pun?)  I don't have a bad attention span, but it's not the best.  So, I don't know what's up with those people.  There's too much going on?  I don't think so.  It's a fast read for almost 600 pages, I think.<br /><br />I just really, honestly cannot think of one bad thing to say about this book.  It was flippin awesome.  READ.  IT.
044654759X|5.0|I have always enjoyed Nicholas Sparks simply because he is an excellent writer.  I have read some of his interviews in which he responds to those who call him a \\"romance writer\\"; however, as he has said before, he writes stories about \\"life\\" -and that is why I enjoy them.    Saying this, I believe that Nicholas has turned a new corner with this novel. While some of his other books have been fast-paced, I can't recall a previous book which has a \\"thriller\\" aspect to the story as this one does.    I do not like reviews in which too much of the plot is given away, so I will suffice it to say that everyone who reads this should be prepared to become engrossed.  Once you are involved with these characters, you will not want to stop until you get to the end.
0394806220|3.0|The book was not clean and the spine was damaged. Rice was up in the spine so when I held it open to read to the kids it all fell out on the floor. It appeared that the pages were torn from the spine than glue together because they didn't open properly. I needed the book for my lessons or it would have went back.
B003O85W3A|5.0|\\"The Suburbs\\" by Arcade Fire will rank near my list of top album releases for twenty ten for several reasons. First, it simply sounds great--the music is energetic, dense, and layered, and the vocals convey the right tone and emotion. It would have been easy for this recording to tilt toward bombast, but Winn Butler and Arcade Fire finesse sufficient restraint and taste throughout.<br /><br />Second, the album hangs together seamlessly and properly. I often listen to recordings and second guess song selection, order of songs, etc, but none of that here. I know there is an overarching concept about not being able to go back home or to another time, but it does not get in the way or demand too much attention.<br /><br />Third, Arcade Fire addresses modern angst and detachment without getting too lost in the weeds. Taken for what it is, \\"The Suburbs\\" could be a musical rendition of a Walker Percy novel, a slice of life captured effectively that does not require too much overthinking or analysis.<br /><br />I recommend a bit of volume and listening through a real stereo to bring out the best in this recording.
0312330537|5.0|A must read for anyone who has spent time in India. Mesmerizing! I took this book on a trip and found myself walking down the aisle of the plane while still reading it. I just couldn't put it down. It's a very long book but so captivating that the reading time just flies by. The author claims that 'some' of the novel is based on fact and some he made up while in prison. After spending much time in India myself, I suspect that quite a bit of this book is based on fact! I can't wait until the movie comes out!
0316010669|4.0|The author describes the main subject of this book as \\"thin- slicing\\" which is our ability to gauge what is really important. During this we often make better decisions then a well researched decision. He also states that , \\"analysis paralysis\\", or information overload can often times cloud our judgment. People will need to shift their focus to only the most critical information in order to make the best decision. The author also talks about the halo effect, in which people build a perception using one or two traits that \\"overshadow\\" the other traits. In example, if you see someone who is wearing dirty clothes and their hair is messy, you may think of them as being poor, when in reality he could be a wealthy doctor that was just working in his yard.   I never looked at Malcom Gladwells articles in the New Yorker. From reading other reviews it seems like this book is a compilation of different articles and they are criticizing that fact. It doesn't make a difference to someone like me. I find his books to be informative and easy to read. Like any business book though you may find that the author over exaggerates on a certain theory or point they are trying to make. Many business books you will find also that the same famous examples are used over and over again. Just skip over it and continue reading.  My philosophy is read as much as you can, even if you don't agree with the others person or groups point of view, their view just helps you build a basis to better support your own opinion.  This book is good for marketers, business owners, MBA students and people that are interested in building insight on spontaneous decision making.
0307454541|1.0|I began skimming in chapter 3. By chapter 4 I took it back to the library. If this is the kind of trash people find entertaining to read, then our society is in much deeper trouble than I originally thought. I suspect many of the purchases that propelled this garbage to the level of \\"bestseller\\" were done without knowing the true nature of it's content. I'm grateful I didn't waste any of my money on it.
1416550550|5.0|A 4 year old arrives alone on a dock in Australia with only a few belongings in a small white suitcase.  When the man who found and cared for her dies, a 21 year old Nell is given the suitcase.  Within it is a book of fairy tales written by the woman who put her on the boat.  Nell's quest to find her origins takes her (and then her granddaughter) on a journey to England and a cottage on a cliff with a walled garden.<br /><br />Although this book did not immediately grab my attention, within the first 30 pages, I was hooked.  Kate Morton beautifully intermingled the characters as she took us from the 1900s, to the 1970s and 2005.  I enjoyed the fairy tales and was very impressed that she had written those as well...she should consider a book of fairy tales in the future!  There is so much that is intriguing about this book - mystery, suspense, an old mansion with a maze, birth, death, sickness, murder - and it all culminates in an ending that was on my mind for days afterward.<br /><br />I chose this book for our book club and so I read it again to pick up any details that I may have missed.  I was totally engrossed in it for the second time and enjoyed it even more.
B002N5N5M0|5.0|Reading prior reviews of this season did not lead to unrealistic expectations.   I was glued throughout, and while the finale shocked, it did feel right.  Can't wait until season five!

B0037AGASG|4.0|I bought this cd for my kids as a joke because I thought they only talked about \\"the bieb\\" ironically... boy was I wrong.  If it's not playing in the van, it's playing on their ipods, and if not either of those you can guarantee they are humming something from the album.  I think I might even have a hint of the Bieber Fever... which I have been fighting with Echinacea and Metallica.
0765326353|5.0|What can I say?  It's a good read, and extra points for making the book pretty.  The design in previous books haven't been great.  This one has much better graphics to match the excellent plot.    I probably would rate Mistborn higher than this, but this is a very exciting world, and I want to read more.  Now!
1559402652|3.0|Well this movie was made in 1964 at the height of Beatlemania and so it is a slice of history made at that special time-a real phenomenon.  It is good to see the Beatles run around and play their music.  There really was not another time like this for anyone/group ever.  Maybe Elvis came close...but rally this was an amazing time period.    As for the movie/story line, there really is not much.  So buy the movie because this is a time capsule of a rare event and watch it to see the Beatles perform and do not expect any sort of plot-  there is no drama here.
0060558121|1.0|It's an aweful boring story that doesn't make sence at all, I readed the first 100 pages and had to put the book down cause I couldn't handle all the crap.<br />I waisted my money and time.
0374158460|5.0|A big book, tackling big themes, but one that never loses sight of the particular humanity of its characters.  Jonathan Franzen has something to say (I suspect that's what makes it controversial in some people's minds, but come on, if you don't want an author to give you the news, stick to crime thrillers or bodice-ripping romances), and he wants you to think, but he doesn't employ any postmodern devices, he just tells a great story, in beautiful (and quite funny) prose, that is about us as much as it is about the people on the page.  More fiction should be like this!

B003XKPPOU|5.0|I am an old school toy story veteran, having grown up with the series I was so moved by this movie. I was glad that Disney/Pixar didnt let me down by continuing the series in a horrible franchise move. It was well done completely, nostalgic and a true work of art. I recommend anyone who wants to relive childhood memories needs to watch this movie.
B0036EH3X4|5.0|A lot of people complained about how this show wrapped up. I think that's unfair - it was so respectable that they decided to end it before it got too convoluted.<br /><br />Really, my only complaint about this product is the lack of special features. It drives me crazy that the majority of them are only available on the Complete Series Set (which any loyal fan already owns on the separate DVDs...grr!!). But...we should have seen this one coming.

B000FO0AOC|5.0|For those of you that love soul,this is a must have. It was interesting to see that the latest winner of America's Got Talent is a huge Otis Redding fan and that he had an influence on his style of singing. Is it any wonder that he won? By that, I'm guessing there's a lot of us that still love to hear an amazing voice.
B003NHRIVQ|5.0|Loved this story.  A teenage girl lost and confused finds her worth and direction in caring for her ill father.  It was exciting to see the healing take place and maturity to begin.  A wonderful book for teenage and beyond.  Many good principles and lessons to gain.
B0010X8NF0|4.0|The Darjeeling Limited is a quirky dramadey that follows three brothers: Francis, Peter  and Jack as they journey across India on the Darjeeling Limited. The trip is arranged by the eldest  brother, Frances, in what he in hopes that it will begin to heal the rift that developed between the him  and his brothers after their father's death a year earlier. As their journey wears on the brothers find  themselves confronting a large number of issues that causes the youngest Jack to question whether or  not they would actually be friends if they weren't family.         I found the Darjeeling Limited as a whole to be an rewarding viewing experience. The acting of  Owen Wilson, Adrian Brody and Jason Schwartman was solid through out the the movie. Any viewer  who has felt the sting of sibling rivalry will be able to relate to one of these characters, regardless of  gender. The art direction, as is always the case with Wes Anderson's films, is thoughtfully executed to  give the movie a surreal feel, without being unbelievable.         For those who are not familiar with director Wes Anderson's work, let me give a brief  explanation of the director's work. Anderson does his best to confirm the auteur theory of film making.  He has written, directed and had a heavy hand in the the art direction of all his movies, which gives  his movies eccentric nature that has become his trademark. They generally fall far outside the normal  range of story and setting of the average Hollywood film, which for the most part has gained he large  following in the art house segment of film audiences. Anderson's movies are character driven affairs  and the settings the characters inhabit are largely a reflection of their circumstances in life.  In the case of the Darjeeling Limited, the train trip is an excuse to get the characters in the same  room so that they may interact with one another. Francis, the eldest, tries to fulfill the role of mother  and father for his two younger brothers. Themiddle brother Peter, lashes out against his other two  siblings by claiming their dying father's last words claimed Peter as his favorite. And the youngest  brother Jack, a writer, repeatedly fails in his attempts to play peacemaker, the most notable of which  was macing his two older brothers in the dining car. The three brothers set up a chain of action and  reaction which drives the story.         For people who are not used to this type of storytelling, the Darjeeling Limited might seem  boring. In an average Hollywood film, the plot is moved by the events that unfold and characters  largely play a reactionary role to those events. Characters in these types of movies are unchanged by  things that have happened around them. In Anderson's films, the plot is shaped and moved by the force  of the characters personalities and often by the end of the movie, characters have undergone some  major personality shifts. By the end of the Darjeeling Limited all three characters make major life  decisions based on their interactions with each other on their trip. Well known movies that have similar  character driven stories are: One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest, The Usual Suspects, The Bucket List,  As Good as it Gets, Love Actually, Juno and Napoleon Dynamite. If you've seen any of these movies  and for the most part thought they were far too slow and more than a little pointless, you probably will  not like The Darjeeling Limited.         For those who are familiar you who are familiar with Anderson's work, The Darjeeling Limited  is an improvement over his previous film The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou, but fails to live up to  what has been his pinnacle work The Royal Tenenbaums. The art direction does not over whelm the  production as it did in the The Life Aquatic, although the matching Louis Vuitton luggage set was a bit  over the top. The writing has also improved since the last moving and shows a better understanding of  the timing in comedic performance. All of which adds up to a more fulfilling movie and a sign of true  artistic growth on the part of its director.
0439023513|2.0|VAGUE SPOILERS BELOW!!    I just kept wondering what happened to the determined, capable, and disciplined Katniss of The Hunger Games? Collins abandoned the compelling storyline to focus entirely on Katniss' mental instability. One might argue that she is attempting to realistically demonstrate the toll of war, but if a realistic treatment is the focus, why do people keep trusting this unstable girl with weapons? Katniss retains the trust and devotion of other characters while it is obvious to the reader that the virtues that made her a compelling character gradually disappeared.     The narrative is disjointed and hard to follow, the final mission was ludicrously pointless, and all the characters I still cared about were either dead or barely mentioned.

B001LPWGE6|5.0|Really loved every movie in the trilogy.Great action,writing and story line.Matt Damon delivers a solid performance,really makes the character likable and in the end hoping he finds his true identity.I'm hoping for another movie but at the same time almost afraid that if they get the wrong director or writer they could screw up this wonderful franchise

0743289692|5.0|I was amazed by this book. This an auto-biography of Ali Hirshi's life. It begins when she is a young girl growing up in war-torn Somalia. Because her father is a political person her family must move from one Islamic country to another, this gives you differing views of the Islamic faith and how they are interpreted. As a young Muslim girl she tries her best to follow the rules of her religion and in the end she rebels against it, she flees to Holland,a liberal country where she finds many more Muslims have also gone. She finds some Muslims are trying to keep many of the customs of the Islamic faith alive, such as honor killings, this horrifies her and she becomes political,she becomes like a Senator in that country and is eventually labeled an Infidel and has a death threat against her.       There are a few places where it drags a little but on the whole a very interesting book.[[ASIN:0743289692 Infidel]]

0345494768|5.0|The making of star wars book is a great book on the making of the very 1st star wars film. It has lots of photos , storys etc in the book. A great book and J.W. Rinzler again has written another good star wars book here.
B001BPJJ1E|1.0|As others have posted, this was possibly the worst print of the movie they could find - it is full of very noticeable scratches and horrible cuts that cause momentary gaps in the movie at various places. Plus it's a pan & scan. What they did to this great film is an embarrassment to the DVD business.    But, there is now an alternative...    If you have a Region 2 compatible DVD player that can handle PAL (or a computer that can read and play region 2 DVDs - which is more common), then you can buy this version from Amazon.co.uk.  http://www.amazon.co.uk/Melody-DVD-Jack-Wild/dp/B002VD5SA6/    This version (which I ordered and had shipped from the UK) is an absolutely stunning print - not a scratch to be seen. And it's a wide-screen version as well.
B003QNXPUK|1.0|It hasn't passed also weeks as the film has started to come unstuck along the edges. I can't use a guarantee because I have got it on Amazon.com.
0439023491|5.0|I didn't read The Hunger Games until both Catching Fire and Mockingjay were released.<br />I had a sneaking suspicion that once I started the first book, I would need to devour the<br />two other books of the trilogy immediately. And that was, indeed, the case. But because<br />of this, I sometimes don't have a clear picture of Catching Fire in my mind. To me, the<br />three books read as one big story--one big story with awesome characters, who are good,<br />evil, and sometimes ambiguously both; amazing settings, described so that readers can<br />totally get there in their minds; and a plot that will make readers shudder with horror and<br />compel them to keep reading. I love that Collins is continually upping the stakes. Every<br />time I thought the story couldn't get more terrifying or suspenseful, Collins found a way<br />to take it to the next level.
B000KJU182|5.0|This was Terrance Stamp's first starring role, soon to be followed by \\"The Collector,\\" another classic. This particular DVD contains a wonderfully cleaned-up version of the film plus a narrative by Stamp himself, something no other version has. It's a black and white film that will make you hate Robert Ryan and fall in love with Stamp as the personifications of evil and innocence. The heart of the story is what happens when pure evil and pure innocence clash.<br /><br />I warn you, have a hanky or two close by as you will definitely need them. This is one of my all time favorite films and this DVD is the best edition on the market. Get it!<br /><br />P.S. -- Despite the tag, Gregory Peck is not in this film.
B000N4SHOE|4.0|There you have it, \\"Miss Potter\\" is a very good movie. To suggest  to someone to read the books instead is not worth commenting on... any further than that.
B003MZ0I84|5.0|Maroon 5 have quickly became one of the best and most noteworthy bands in music today.  [[ASIN:B003MZ0I84 Hands All Over]], arguably the band's best and most cohesive effort, solidifies Maroon 5's status as pop music's pre-eminent band.  Across Hands All Over, the band encompasses styles of adult contemporary pop, pop-soul, and neo-disco.  The production work by famed rock producer Robert John \\"Mutt\\" Lange is breathtaking while the mixing job by Mike Shipley is more than commendable.  Maroon 5 have made one of the years top albums, easily.<br /><br />\\"Misery\\" opens this affair with great production work that includes crisp sounding guitars and sound, sound drum production work.  The groove is superb and the songwriting is perfect.  Frontman Adam Levine sounds among his best ever here, singing the killer, catchy refrain \\"I am in misery/there ain't nobody who can comfort me, oh ye/why won't you answer me/the silence is slowly killing me...\\"  \\"Misery\\" proves to be a fine first single and great cut.  \\"Give A Little More\\" doesn't concede one iota of greatness, further propelling the momentum established by \\"Misery.\\" The simplicity of \\"Give A Little More\\" couple with the great production work and smart mixing make it sensational, not to mention Levine's channeling of Michael Jackson at the end (the closing vocal nuance).<br /><br />\\"Stutter\\" continues the upswing, returning the band to a more pop-driven setting, though never compromising the soulful vibe.  Here, the band employs gimmickry with \\"stuttered lyrics,\\" which just enhances the cut.  Again, the songwriting is clever and the production work grand.  \\"Don't Know Nothing\\" may not stand out as much as \\"Misery,\\" \\"Give A Little More,\\" or \\"Stutter,\\" but on an album this consistently great, it is hard to fine an objectionable cut.  On \\"Don't Know Nothing,\\" Levine continues to grow vocally with his falsetto become more and more flawless.  \\"Never Gonna Leave This Bed\\" channels 1980s production work with an Sting and the Police adult contemporary sound and well produced 80s hearkening drums.  The refrain is as clever as all others, finding Levine singing so catchily \\"wake you up in the middle of the night, to say I will never away again/I'm never gonna leave this bed...\\" - pop brilliance, in all its majesty.<br /><br />\\"I Can't Lie\\" amps up the soulful side of the band once more (think [[ASIN:B00006879E Songs About Jane]]) with Levine's opening vocal nuances channeling Marvin Gaye  a la \\"Mercy Mercy Me (The Ecology).\\"  Bassist Mickey Madden thickens up the bass line here, contributing to the soulful vibe of \\"I Can't Lie.\\"  On \\"Hands All Over,\\" the band channels a pure pop quality (almost acidic), which includes one of the albums most addictive hooks.  \\"Hands All Over\\"  is one of few title tracks I've heard in recent times that lives up to the hype.<br /><br />\\"How\\" finds the band back in full on adult contemporary mode, while \\"Get Back In My Life\\" returns to the soulful takes of \\"I Can't Lie.\\"  \\"Just A Feeling\\" plays like a Police ballad finding  Levine sounding as inspired as ever; it reminds me of \\"Back At Your Door\\" from [[ASIN:B000P2A256 It Won't Be Soon Before Long]].  \\"Runaway\\" uses a neo-disco groove, which is different from any other cut on this album.  While there is slightly less substance on \\"Runaway\\"  than the best cuts, it is enjoyable as anything else.  Closing track \\"Out of Goodbyes\\" (on the standard edition), ends the album on an `excellent note.'  Levine finds great chemistry singing with Hillary Scott  of Lady Antebellum.  The songwriting is fine here and the production calm, cool, and collected.<br /><br />The Deluxe Edition of the album (5 more tracks) yields some worthwhile cuts.  \\"Last Chance\\" may be the best, as it could've appeared on the standard edition without effecting the flow in the least.  \\"No Curtain Call\\"  is interesting and enjoyable, but doesn't allure me as much as other cuts.  Acoustic versions of \\"Never Gonna Leave This Bed\\" and \\"Misery\\" are both winners, but it is a superb live cover of Alicia Keys's \\"If I Ain't Got You\\" that steals the show.<br /><br />What can I say? This album is nearly perfect - especially by today's standards.  Adam Levine sounds the best he ever has  and I don't think anyone thought that 'Hands All Over' would threaten to be the band's very best album.  But let's face it  - has Maroon 5 made a bad album? (This is rhetorical by the way).  4 1/2 stars.  One of 2010's best.cover of Alicia Keys's \\"If I Ain't Got You\\" that steals the show.     What can I say? This album is nearly perfect - especially by today's standards.  Adam Levine sounds the best he ever has  and I don't think anyone thought that 'Hands All Over' would threaten to be the band's very best album.   But let's face it  - has Maroon 5 made a bad album?

0757302661|1.0|maybe the classes are more helpful, but this book is pretty much too general to be useful at all - there are no real exercises (i guess if you could learn it all from the book then who would shell out a few hundred for the class??)  it's also pretty ridiculous to give women the idea that a painless childbirth is a reachable goal through this method. i think it's much more realistic to think about how to use breathing and hypnosis to MANAGE the pain.    this book makes a lot of promises but definitely doesn't teach you enough about how to actually DO the method!
B003H6KRIE|5.0|This is a great trilogy of movies. Even though they are essentially the HD-DVD transfers they still look amazing. If you own the these on dvd do yourself a favor and upgrade to the bluray. Amazing picture and sound! you can't go wrong.

0765326353|5.0|The Way of Kings is one of the best books I have read in a long time.  Yes, it is a long book and requires you to invest a lot time but I think you will find the effort worthwhile.  The characters are believable, the magic system he introduces is fairly unique, and you really get a feel for the world he is creating.  I just hope we don't have to wait years for the next one!
B003VJTGLQ|3.0|Gladiator suffered from excessive DNR and Edge Enhancement (complete with some smearing in some scenes), The Godfather had excessively grainy picture (even moreso than Robocop!!!), and while Saving Private Ryan had major audio issues in the last 30 minutes of the film. And this... well, one should wonder why Star Trek, Iron Man, and Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen would get great transfers (I liked SW and IM, hated T:ROTF), and not any of the \\"Sapphire Series\\" releases. The daytime scenes look nice, although the whites overpower a tonne (like when Lester dials the friend's number and hangs up), whereas the night scenes were harsh and excessively grainy, not to mention blacks sometimes looked pixilly. Special Features were nothing special and exactly the same as the DVD. Again, for \\"sapphire series\\", if you're even gonna consider it that, you should put some decent stuff for features on there.<br /><br />As for the film. Well, you'd have to be insane not to like it. A fantastic film that will change your life. I was 12 when I saw it, and I had never seen anything like it. It changed how I view movies forever, and repeated viewings have been just as incredible as the first.<br /><br />In short, don't toss your DVD out just yet. Buy this, for sure, but keep your original DVD.
B00000IL67|5.0|My husband has been a long-time fan of Alice Cooper and has all of his cassette tapes from over the years.  Needless to say, cassette tapes are sort of obsolete now so I thought I would try to upgrade him to some CDs.  I read the other reviews and they said if you are a fan of Alice Cooper and don't just like a select few of his songs, this set is for you.  The other reviews are dead-on.  My hubby really, really likes the set and listens to the CDs all the time.  He also said that there are some songs on the CDs that just aren't available anymore so he's thoroughly enjoying his birthday present.
0545310601|2.0|I'm so dissappointed!! I was engulfed by the flames of the girl on fire when reading the first book. The flames started to waver some when I read the second book, and by the third there wasn't even smoke to show that the flames ever existed.... That's honestly how I feel after reading The Hunger Games series. The worst part is this series had so much potential to be GREAT. Why, why, why did Katniss become a shell of a person, sure after going through all that anybody would, but this is a fantasy and Katniss is too strong to just give up. It's yet another reminder that life doesn't always go as perfectly as planned and in the end we just have to deal with what's thrown our way. Make lemonade out of lemons and settle for what we have...ugh....just an easy way to end what should have been a great story. It's as if Katniss went through all of it for nothing, she's still being controlled, she's still not truely happy, and President Snow got what he wanted in the end... He killed the Mockingjay, because a person isn't really alive without their spirit. I will forever be dissappointed by what could have been great....
B002UXRGLG|4.0|this makes a great gift, especially for dads. the filming is just so inspiring and a great series as with all of David Attenborough nature films.
B002ZG977Y|1.0|Another CGI flick for the purpose of using CGI, no need for story or acting or even actors. The plot is an insipid, confused mess, and for no better reason than trying too hard to be \\"fresh\\" and different from the original film (which for all its cheesy effects, is far superior). Instead, we get boring and pointless. I think that is the key word here, Pointless. Lets see, the logic of this remake is: mortals are tired of the GODS petty and ruthless rule over them, so they rebel (sans Hercules TV Series). The GODS demonstrate, repeatedly and unquestionably, their limitless power over the puny humans. In other words, it's made crystal clear that simple mortals CAN NOT WIN against the GODS. So they are being really, really stupid for even trying; and the viewer is left scratching his head almost from the start of the movie, thinking \\"boy, are these people suicidal idiots, or what?\\" Simultaneously, to keep the title relevant (it is 'Clash of the Titans'---not 'Clash of men and gods,' afterall), we have a sub-plot of Hades trying to knock off Zeus and take the top spot on Mt. Olympus. So who do we, the audience, cheer for in this free-for-all. The mortals who can't and never will win, or Zeus, who is made out to be both a villian for fighting poor, enslaved humanity, and a savior, for opposing evil Hades? Which is it? Who is Perseus, the supposed hero, championing, besides himself? Humanity? We're led to think so, but then he also seems to be working for Zeus, who is set up as a tyrant and enemy of us mortals. The movie itself doesn't even know the answer. What a stupid, stupid plot! Even for an action flick! The actors looked as bored and lost in the film as I felt watching it.
0385523912|5.0|This book describes the past 60 years of life inside North Korea from the stories of actual defectors; you will follow their journeys inside the regime up until their eventual defection. This book really is an incredible read, the stories are captivating and Demick does an absolutely fantastic job of re-creating these people's lives on paper.     If you want to know what everyday life is like inside North Korea, read this book. It's not only entertaining and emotional, but also incredibly informative. Despite the fall of the Soviet Union and European Communism, North Korea remains an enigma and it makes for a fascinating study.
B002VPE1Z2|4.0|As others have said, this case is pretty large.  It's a bit more bulky than I'd prefer for carrying around, but it is a nice case.  The exterior is soft, the construction seems solid, and the camera compartment is well padded and lined to prevent scratches.<br /><br />Things that I like about it:<br /> - The soft exterior really is quite nice.  To me, it's a very comfortable item to pick up and hold.<br /> - I have complete confidence that my camera is well protected given the padding and soft lining of the case.<br /> - There is a separate zippered pocket for other items (such as spare batteries, memory cards, ID, keys, whatever).<br /> - The belt loop uses velco, so you can put on and remove the case without taking off your belt.<br /><br />The only thing that I'd change is to replace the belt loop with a belt clip.  Other than that, this is a nice case and good buy at the current ten dollar price.

B003V6L94Q|4.0|I don't know how to begin this really. \\"You Get What You Give\\" is a great country album, but when you have The Nashville Music machine on your side, you literally can't have a bad album.  They've invested in you & they aren't going to see there investment fail.  And that's what you have with this CD.  The soul of \\"The Foundation\\" is gone, the home town feel...gone, & most dissapointedly, The Zac Brown Sound is gone.  What we have is a polished, over produced Rhinestone cowboy of an album.  It \\"sounds\\" alittle like everyone,you've got Jimmy Buffett, James Taylor, Billy Joel (the piano man years), Brad Paisley, Darius Rucker (check out trk#3 it sounds identical to \\"it won't be like this for long\\"), Dave Matthews (all that touring together really shows), & just enough ZBB to put their name on it. Every song feels like I've heard it before.     To sum it up I like this album alot, but I was looking for a ZBB CD not just another country album.  And shoot, even the songs that sound like ZBB just seem like re-tooled versions of songs off \\"The Foundation\\" (I actually started singing along to them with lyrics from that album & they fit the rythem).      As a country album I give this CD 5-Stars, as a ZBB CD I give it 3-Stars.    Like a relative or friend whose passed away, we'll talk about ZBB fondly, but I don't think we'll ever get the magic back.
B003TML0VO|4.0|Overall this is a great album and Carlos plays his ass off! There is something for everyone on here! I love While My Guitar Gently Weeps,Back in Black with Nas is awesome, Whole Lotta Love, Can't You Hear Me Knocking, Sunshine of Your Love just slam out of the gate and Under The bridge with Andy Vargas is great too. This is a great album to drive too, work out too or to get you pumped up and the ballads are Carlos at his best.  The energy is amazing!    One of my favorites of the year!

B0027BOL4G|5.0|I saw this on PBS and also promoted on the Oprah show.  It is extremely well done.  Has a lot of information on following the food on your plate back to the farm.  It has alot of information.....I've watched it at least four times (learn more each time) and plan to show it to a Holistic Health class I'm teaching.  It is very informative and not for the faint of heart (you will see horrible conditions that animals are raised in vs. the organic small farm method).  Seeing animals butchered will bother some, but it is a reality of where food comes from.  It is especially upsetting to see how farming has changed over the decades to HUGE corporations and a government that does't seem to have a shred of concern for the animals or crops, farmers, workers, or the consumer.  The USA has some of the UNHEALTHIEST people in the world due to poor diet and lack of exercise.  This film does encourage us to change the food industry because our food CHOICES drive this industry.  Do we care enough to change it?
B003TML0VO|5.0|This is Santana doing cover tunes his way! Relevant and tactful renderings of some of our favorite tunes with some Latin flavor a la Santana. The singers all bring personal interpretations of these classics. Joe Cocker is on here man! Damn! I can only say; \\"Viva Santana\\"!

B00127RAJY|3.0|Again, I was not really impressed with it.  It seems to me that Jillian is more into telling someone what to do than do it herself, too.  That was a turn off for me.  However, on the other hand, many have lost weight under her direction.  For the money, it does the job.
B000FP2OPY|5.0|What can I say?  The shows are entertaining and everyone should get hooked on this show.  Time to order the next seasons too!
0790729350|5.0|With the addition of 40 minutes which were cut from the theatrical release, the viewer can get a fuller appreciation of the scope and magnitude of the event. I only got to read about the festival since I was serving in the army in August, 1969 (guess where?). So, although I've listened to the music all my life (and played a bunch of it as a touring musician), I had still never seen this complete version of the file of the event until now. I wish I hadn't waited so long!
B003DKJ5ZU|3.0|This review is on the Blu-ray disc's audio track on Tinker Bell's Great Fairy Rescue. Why did Disney force the DTS HD audio track down to PCM (2 channel audio) if you are using Toslink (optical)? All the other Disney Blu-ray's that we own including the previous Tinker Bell and the Lost Treasure all have DTS HD audio track and they output fine to 5.1 channels of sound via Toslink.<br /><br />The movie is great though and my 2 daughter enjoyed the story and the picture quality is awesome.<br /><br />I'm just hoping this is a glitch on production and Disney recall's the Blu-ray. Otherwise this is disappointing.
1439102813|5.0|Everyone is afraid of getting Alzheimer's Disease and with good reason.  This book takes you on a horrific journey into the heart of this tragic condition.  It starts out with the supposedly 'normal' forgetting that 'normal' people do, that we all do, and try to convince ourselves that it doesn't mean anything.  Usually we are right, for a little while, at least, as the Alice of the book is.  But it soon becomes obvious that it's more than simple forgetting.    Every single aspect of Alzheimer's, and its practical implications, is covered here.  It really is a tour into hell.  It was clever of the author to make the victim a woman still in the prime of life because it shows the contrast between what her life was and should have remained, and what it deteriorates into.  I found myself so thankful that the characters were fictional because if they were real then it would have been even more tragic.  But of course they are real---they just have different names and live in another city.  They are all around you.  Maybe they are you, the future you.    This book will change how you look at life, and there are very few books that can truly make that claim and live up to it.
B000001EGE|5.0|Honky Chateau by Elton John, for those not too familar with elton john's work this is a great album with classics like rocket man and honky cat and one of my favorites, mona lisa's and mad hatter's, this is one of the best studio albums by Elton John, and his music partner and lyricist mr. Bernie Taupin, amazing song writer, this release is'nt just for fans of Elton John it's for fans of great songs, and excellent song writing.

B003JTHESA|5.0|Iron Maiden's new 2010 release The Final Frontier, This new release from Iron Maiden just might be the best release since powerslave, coming from a real long time Maiden fan, I take this very serious, in my humble opinion, The song writing on the Final Frontier may be Steve Harris's best in 25 years, What I love about this release is at first listen, your excited and the fact that they Iron Maiden, have never released an album where two tracks run together to create an epic opening track, this really jump start's the cd, very melodic and stellar tracks I believe that the last song on the cd, \\"where the wild wind Blows\\" may be the best song writing since Hallowed be thy name, it's epic and at a whopping 10 minutes and 59 seconds it's not your typical radio hit, especially at all most 11 minutes, and Bruce Dickinson's voice on the new disc is reason enough to celebrate all things MAIDEN, as a fan I just hope that the Final Frontier is'nt the final release from Iron Maiden, this is the 15th studio release from this legendary band, and for you people who arent excited about this release it is Iron Maiden's 1st release that landed at number 4, on the billboard top 200 in the U.S.alone! now do what I did and order your copy of this Master Piece, on Amazon.com BRILLANT

0812550706|4.0|*As a disclaimer, all of my copies of this book are from the 1986 printing, so technically I am reviewing the \\"unrevised\\" edition. But, from what I heard, the revisions are minor enough to be inconsequential*    Ender's Game is an interesting book. For example, it is one of those novels that seems to really polarize people: a large proportion of its readers love it passionately, while a smaller proportion hate it, with equal passion. It really is the ATLAS SHRUGGED of juvenile science fiction literature. And there's another thing: it reads like children's lit, but I never see it classed as such. It is popularly considered something of a \\"gateway drug\\" for science fiction, which, when you think about it, isn't really surprising. The book is thrilling, fast-paced, well-written, supremely engaging, and, best of all (from the hypothetical perspective of someone who wants to get a non sci-fi reader into sci-fi) doesn't drown the reader in complex speculative ideas. Indeed, for many people, including myself, this was the first science-fiction novel that they had ever read, and so it is difficult for people to talk about this without getting nostalgic. But I shall attempt to.    Although I am unaware of the author's intentions while writing this, Ender's Game reads, simultaneously, as both a tribute to and a satire of space opera and military sci-fi. The author has stated that he hadn't read Starship Troopers before writing this, which I find fascinating, as this book reads EXACTLY like what I would imagine a pacifist response to Starship Troopers would look like (in reality, though, such an honor has already been claimed by Haldeman's The Forever War).    The Plot: Aliens, called \\"Buggers\\" in this novel for their insectoid aspect, have attacked Earth, which only escaped destruction by the skin of its nose. In response, humanity has created oribiting Battle Schools which train children to become tacticians and soldiers for the International Fleet through the use of elaborate 'games,' where teams of children compete in what appears to be a kind of futuristic laser tag in a zero-G environment. Ender Wiggin, a small, tormented (bullied at school and by his older brother, and resented for being a Third-- overpopulation is a problem in this future world, you see, and families are allowed to have more than two children only due to the drastic circumstances of an interstellar war), yet superintelligent six-year-old boy is sent to Battle School, unwittingly carrying all of the hopes and dreams of the I.F. on his shoulders, due to his superior breeding (more on that in a moment). We follow him as his superiors throw him into increasingly tougher situations in order to toughen him up for the long-awaited third engagement with the Buggers).    Card is a strong storyteller, and it is this that makes Ender's Game such a joy to read. The themes of violence and its justification (or lack, thereof) are imminently complex and he respects the intelligence of his audience by not simplifying his exploration of them into placid anti-war propaganda (although it is worth noting that all of the themes explored in this novel are explored in MUCH more depth in the much more philosophical sequels). And the characterizations are well-drawn and convincing (some find the very mature child characters to be unconvincing, but I can tell you, from personal experience, that there is a lot of realism to the ways in which these mentally-adult children think). Ender's tortured psychology is extremely well-done.    Card also gets kudos for his prescient model of the internet back in the mid-eighties.    It isn't a perfect novel, however. For one thing, its strength as a gateway drug also make it very, very light reading for any moderately experienced reader of sci-fi. There really isn't a lot of meat here. Moreover, I get the fact that Card is setting up Ender as an almost mythological character,, but he really is too perfect a character. Ender Wiggin comes off as more ofa God than a human (although, admittedly, he is resented by other students in this novel for that very reason). The plot material is also unoriginal and, conceptually, uncompelling. Card's skills at characterization and story-telling are what make this novel: try just reading an outline of the plot sometime, though, and see if it doesn't sound like it should be bad fanfiction. It has been said before that it isn't so much what you do as how you do it, and that truth never shines through more clearly than it does in this novel. And finally, there is a very odd eugenicist undertone to the whole novel. For instance, Ender was basically bred for genius (the reason his parents were allowed to have a third child was because of their superior genes, apparently). Moreover there are several lines in this novel about genes determining behavior. Now, this is true, to an extent, but I have to wonder what Card really thinks about the selective breeding of traits in humans.    All in all, Ender's Game is a gem, and you should read it if you haven't. And if you have, then re-read it. It stays fun and compelling no matter how many times I go through it. Highly recommended.
B0025UHKNS|2.0|I bought this without doing a whole lot of research.  Afterward my friends all told me I was stupid for buying it because there have been so many problems with the 405.  Turns out they're right.  It frequently crashes and has to be reset, and sometimes the \\"hold both buttons down\\" reset method doesn't even work, so you have to wait for the battery to drain.<br /><br />The touch bezel is one of those ideas that seems great to designers, but doesn't work out for real.  It thinks you're touching it when it gets sweaty.<br />I have a small scratch on the bezel now and it doesn't recognize touches in that area.  At least it didn't kill the whole bezel, but I'm afraid a bigger scratch might.<br />The backlight also stopped working, around the same time as the scratch on the bezel.  Don't know if they're related or not.  I'm a trail runner and a mountain biker, need something a little more sturdy that won't break from the inevitable bangs and scratches.<br /><br />Battery life could stand to be longer too.  I'm lucky if I get 9 hours out of it, which doesn't cut it for a lot of my long runs.
B003XWEQ1G|3.0|This is a fantastic film but Ridley Scott has set a pretty high standard with extras on the DVD release of his films.  Robin Hood is disappointing  - no directors commentary and just a superficial making of doco.  The \\"director's notebook\\" is designed in a clunky and intrusive format - would be great to just be able to watch the insert segments without having to keep the film running behind.
B0017SWPXY|4.0|I am going to be reading it For BOOK CLUB and cant wait!         Marcie McAdams
0765348780|4.0|I really love this book. And if you're looking for something completely emersive and challenging, then this is the book for you. This is a fantasy novel for smart people! I have a master's in English lit, and I still wrestle with the series. The author expects a lot from his readers...patients, research, and a willingness to review earlier novels and chapters. But, like I said, if you're up to the challenge, you'll love it. The more I invest in this series, the more attached I become.
B0014QZMU2|4.0|I am stingy with stars or I would give this set five.  It has only been played with twice so far so I'm not sure about durability but it seems good and sturdy in keeping with Legos overall.  This set works well for both my 2-1/2 and 4 year old grandsons.  Filling the diesel engine with gas is a favorite activity (sound effect) but the crane, conveyor belt,and truck provide for loading/unloading play as well.  The sound effects (gas pump and engine only) are not loud or obnoxious and just add an additional sensory element. It is battery-operated but only requires 3- AA and has a simple on/off button on top of the engine. Again, this aspect doesn't detract from play value since the other elements are all hand-operated.  This set would seem appropriate to a fairly wide age range, first to be used after assembly by someone older and then for construction by the child him or herself.
B003PX85GK|3.0|This album does not compare to the first two albums by BOH.  The album is not horrible and you may actually really like it if you have not listened to the prior albums.  BOH is great because of there unique sound and during some of these songs that originality is gone.  It just sounds like a regular rock band instead of the sound we have grown to love from BOH.  I will say this album is worth listening to but I am confident you will come to the conclusion that the first two albums are ten times better.
B003DTMLKM|4.0|Boston fans will be disappointed! No behind the scenes from there(first city she made a concert back in America). I was there and would like to see some footage included!)I also didnt like the songs they included in the middle of the movie (not that I dont like to see Celine singing)its just that I wanted to see as much behind the scenes as possible. The concert Dvd is included in this box set, so I didnt think it was necessary to repeat that on \\"Through the eyes of the world\\" In addition, the pics are TINY, except a FEW that have a good size. You need a magnifying glass to see them! I kid you not!! (very disappointing...)for such expensive item, I was expecting great pictures, I hope that one day they publish a book with descent size photographs!! Otherwise, Celine is just a delight to watch and it was wonderful to see how much hard work she put into it and the tremendous amount of love and respect she has for her fans! I'm a huge fan, and after watching this dvd I love her even more... :)
0817439390|2.0|[[ASIN:0817439390 Understanding Exposure, 3rd Edition: How to Shoot Great Photographs with Any Camera]]    I was disappointed with this book; I was expecting a lot more than a review of all the pictures that the author had taken at various settings. I bought this because of all the 5 star reviews, and thought that I would learn some new ideas, but this is really very basic
1591843065|4.0|The idea of selling an idea using pictures is not new. The challenge is always on how to structure your thoughts. transform thoughts to pictures and at the same time being open for input from others. This book is a practical guide that addresses all of the challenges one may face. The book has contributed greatly my development in this area, and given me direction for further growth. The concept is easy to embrace in your daily life.
1453624910|5.0|SPOILER WARNING: This book itself, plus my review, is a spoiler if you haven't read any of the Nightrunner books by Lynn Flewelling (beginning with [[ASIN:0553575422 Luck in the Shadows (Nightrunner, Vol. 1)]]) or if you've only read Luck in the Shadows.<br /><br />If you have read the Nightrunner series and wished the male/male sex scenes weren't always cut off, this is the short story collection for you. That being said, there's more to it than erotica (and more than just m/m erotica, even). Fitting the title, this collection offers four glimpses into \\"cut scenes\\" from the Nightrunner books, plus a short excerpt from the next book, workingly entitled The Summer Players (title WILL change) and expected to release October 2011. This collection is also peppered with fan art, selected by Lynn herself, depicting scenes from the various short stories. It's a nice touch, as well as a charming homage to her fans.<br /><br />The first short, \\"The Misfit,\\" follows Seregil just after his exile and into his apprenticeship with Nysander. It also details his first sexual encounter in Skala (m/m).<br /><br />The second story, \\"The Wild,\\" covers a short part of Alec's childhood with his father, which includes his father reminiscing about what happened between him and Alec's mother. Warning: hetero sex.<br /><br />The third, \\"By the River,\\" is a previously released short (mostly to fan groups) about how Seregil and Micum met. No erotica (apologies to the Seregil/Micum shippers...ha).<br /><br />\\"The Bond\\" will probably be of the most interest to hardcore Nightrunner fans. No pun intended. (Okay, you got me, pun intended.) Herein lies the details of Seregil and Alec's consummation of their love for one another on that fateful night following the end of Stalking Darkness.<br /><br />Last but not least, \\"The Summer Players (working title),\\" the excerpt from the upcoming Nightrunner book. Some nudity.<br /><br />As always, Flewelling's writing is smooth, enjoyable and easy to follow. If I have one complaint about this collection, it's that it is too short. As far as I'm concerned, all of the glimpses ended too soon. I know these are supposed to be very short snippets--hence the collection title and whatnot--and they had to end somewhere, but I wish each would have gone on just a moment longer. That being said, \\"The Bond\\" was my favorite and the most satisfying glimpse. I also loved \\"The Wild\\" and \\"By the River.\\" I was not as fond of \\"The Misfit,\\" perhaps because I prefer to see Seregil in his more mature and confident state. Not that he doesn't have confidence in this story, but he is also younger and less sure of himself. I will always enjoy the dynamic of Seregil's surety and worldliness to Alec's [seeming] innocence more than I'll enjoy seeing Seregil at one of the worst times in his life (and Alec-less). I think it may also be that while I was curious about everything else that the other glimpses revealed, I guess I wasn't that curious to find out more of what Seregil was like when he was fresh-arrived in Skala. As for the excerpt from the next book, I was already excited but now I really can't wait!<br /><br />I highly recommend this book to any Nightrunner fans; even if you've only finished Luck in the Shadows and [[ASIN:0553575430 Stalking Darkness (Nightrunner, Vol. 2)]], it's a real treat to see behind the curtain and into those scenes that would have made Flewelling's books unpublishable in the mid-90s. And beyond those scenes, it was especially wonderful to sneak a peek at Alec's childhood, plus his parents' and Micum and Seregil's first meetings. If you're a slash fiction fan but haven't read this series, then you will probably enjoy this collection. However, I'd say you'll enjoy it far more if you read the Nightrunner series first (or, again, the first two books).it is too short. As far as I'm concerned, all of the glimpses ended too soon.

B001HN6940|1.0|If your expecting the mostly live action remake to the Disney animated classic, your in for a real let down.<br /><br />I've always loved the animated Alice and it's my favorite of all the Disney classics which is why I'm so disappointed with this version. It's not that the storywriters took liberties to make a mostly original story based on the original Alice, that's fine. It's that the end result is confusing and just plain boring.<br /><br />The movie actually starts off fine seeing Alice from our normal world to Wonderland, but it gets bad from there and I found myself scratching my head so much, you'd have thought I had a dandruff problem or something. We're kind of rudely reminded that this is not a retelling of the original Alice but a pseudo sequel. Alice has appararently returned to Wonderland but then nobody's really sure if she was originally there, even her. The plot is slowly explained over the course of the film but it feels choppy and it never really gets going. I was always in anticipation of meeting all the classic characters and for the fun to begin but it never did. This is a very confusing film because I don't know how to identify it. It's not fun, funny, scary, sad, action packed or intense. It just is. I found myself bored and tired about halfway through. The bleak new Wonderland didn't help as many parts were dark, drab and old characters were all more like older, more serious versions of themselves. I know it's supposed to fit with the new war torn, oppressed Wonderland but what fun is that anyway? It also didn't help that Johnny Depp's Mad Hatter mumbled half his lines throughout the movie and I had no idea what he was talking about. The absolute end for me was the thrown together battle scene and a prophecy fulfillment of Alice to fight a dragon. Uh, what?<br /><br />The audio/video are both excellent, near the best available even, but for me, it seemed as whole movie's selling point. They may have just as well advertised it as, \\"3D everybody, Alice in Wonderland in 3D. Come see our great computer graphics in 3D!\\" I don't really see anything else this movie has to offer other than you can use it to show off your hi def t.v.<br /><br />I'm confident in saying, I'll never watch THIS Alice in Wonderland again as there's really no reason. While it might have had Alice, the only Wonder was as to why the people who made this movie thought that this was a good story. I would've rather they took the easy way out and just do a remake. I'm all for creativity but when you remove everything good about an original story and it's characters, what's left just isn't worth watching.d in 3D.

0316098337|5.0|And I don't say that often.  There are many ways you may interpret this story as it is written.  However, from the standpoint of a mother--or any person wanting to 'mother' a living thing--in spite of obstacles, it couldn't be more perfectly portrayed here. The innate desire for love, or to love for survival is inherent in these pages. I cannot begin to imagine the imagination of the author to produce such a thing, but I would like to know her. My own experiences and my love for my children were so familiar in this, and my family-who never understood, but I love them anyway.  Thank you Emma Donoghue.   Brava!

B003WSFXKY|2.0|Boy, how I hate to have anything negative to say about the work of Carlos Santana, but I just can't give Guitar Heaven: The Greatest Guitar Classics of All Time a passing grade.  I already own most of the tracks in this collection performed by the original artists, so why would I want to purchase a collection of covers?  Good question, but I did, so I don't have a good answer.<br /><br />I have to agree with what some others have had to say.  While the music is acceptable, the individual tracks do lack the passion most of these hits had when first recorded.  Understand that the music is okay, but each of these songs is a classic in their own right and were played nearly perfectly in their original iterations.  Simply put, there is a lack of intensity in some of these performances and that's stunning given the names on the cd.<br /><br />Perhaps I'm just a purist and hard to please and one day twenty years from now this collection will be regarded as a classic.  Anything's possible.  I've always said that I grew up during a time when we had the best music in the world.  From 1964 (maybe earlier) all the way into the `90's, American and British Rock-n-Roll and Blues set the pace.  At the risk of alienating many, pop music is a wasteland now.  Then, of course, I'm showing my age.<br /><br />Peace to all and rock on.
0743455967|2.0|This isn't the worst book on writing that I've read,  but it's not even close to the best (which is John  Gardner's \\"The Art of Fiction.\\") The problems start  with the title, \\"A Memoir of The Craft.\\"  The memoir  section will be of interest only to King fans and of  no interest to anyone else.  There is far too much   content devoted to Tabby (Mrs. King) and to pointless  details that have no bearing on anything, e.g. \\"we were   traveling to a WNBA game between Cleveland and...\\"[who  cares!!]and are quite typical of King's blow-hard style  here and elsewhere.  The writing suggestions are okay  but not new and not particularly insightful. King cites  an editor who called an early story of his \\"too puffy.\\"    That's a bulls-eye review of this book as well:  too  much puff, not enough stuff. (He also mentions TWICE  that he ended his relationship with Viking because of  stupid argument about money. The same point repeated  in IDENTICAL language.  I'm looking at you Mr. or Ms.  Editor!

Season five did well but I kind of knew that since the show would be renewed for a six season that the grand finale was not what Kripke was going to do it felt a little short. One thing I would like to see for either season six or seven is why don't the brother go world wide? Why do they stay on in the states I am sure their are demons in other countries and in other parts of the world. It would be great to see them travel to paris, africa, london and figure how they will get through customs in order to save the world.
0765326353|3.0|This book should be re-edited and reprinted immediately.  It's the first of a presumed 10-book series by one of the most promising authors out there right now, and yet I'm now 40% of the way through the book (going by parts, as I've just finished Part 2 out of 5) and I've already mucked through dozens of typos.  Sometimes a preposition is missing, sometimes a word is misspelled, sometimes the wrong form of a word is used.  I had gotten through a couple of chapters without one and thought maybe it would be clear sailing, but then there were two within three pages of each other.    This is really unacceptable.  I'm glad I got the book from the library rather than purchasing it.  The story itself is strong so far.  Not Sanderson's best, but still good.  To this point, I would have given it four stars, but because of the editing I just can't.  If you can--pardon the pun--weather the storm of stupid errors, there's a good story to be found, but if this kind of thing bothers you, you're going to want to wait until corrections are made or look somewhere else.

B003TML0VO|3.0|I looked forward to this CD so much.  Santana is one of the all time great rock guitarists.  Maybe the best.  Way too much everybody else and nowhere near enough Santana on this CD.  Poorly produced is my first thought...should have got someone who liked the music, like T-Bone Burnett.  Poorly mixed with the guitar placed way behind the vocals and rhythm section, even when taking a guitar break, very often!  All this talent going to waste.  What could have been one of the great rock albums ever, barely (if I was not being generous because I love Santana so much) making three stars.  I think there is poor song selection, too.  Some of the songs on the album, like Back In Black, are painful to listen to.  I thought this might be the great guitar album of all time...but maybe Santana already made it long ago...this sure isn't it!

0345505387|1.0|I have enjoyed the Outlander Series and have it in hardcover as well as audio. This book is not what I expected,very disappointed. I understand it is probably hard to keep the series going for the fans, but if this is the way it will be going, please just end it. I prefer to imagine what Jamie and Claire look like rather than the comic strip take on the characters.
0143118420|5.0|OK, I know I'm the last woman on the planet to read this book.  I heard it was about woman who ditched her family to go find herself in India.  Didn't sound like someone I would respect, so I skipped it.     Was I wrong!  I loved this book!  Why?  Because, this woman who is my exact opposite (\\"social bunny of the Ashram\\"), experienced the exact same God I do.  Ever present.  Wise. Compassionate. Realistic. Universal. How cool is that?      I also thought she was a keen observer of people and described them deliciously.  I loved her sense of humor.  And humility.      I highly recommend listening to it in the author's voice on CD or audio-book.  Her imitations of the characters are hysterical: the Italian guy cheering at the soccer game, the Indian teen tomboy, the medicine man from Bali, Wayan, etc.    I don't want to ruin this spiritual classic with the movie :)
0891419063|5.0|Author E.B. Sledge has written a very compelling account of his experiences as a US Marine during the latter part of WW2. Recounting his time from Recruit training at the US Marine Corps Depot in San Diego and later when he is assigned to the 1st Marine Division and joins them at Pavuvu in the Russell islands group, the story traces his participation in the horrific battles on Peleliu and later Okinawa.<br /><br />The embarkation and move to Peleliu involved travel in hot and uncomfortable troop ships and the author describes this life with a flair for detail and allows the reader to almost feel the discomfort first hand. He describes coming ashore on Peleliu as a form of hell on earth as the defenders met the invading marines at the water's edge. The loss of personnel as the battle progresses inland continues, as the final toll was some 8,769 personnel killed, wounded or missing, with the Japanese experiencing almost 11,000 casualties from the battle. After Peleliu, Sledge returned, with the survivors, to Pavuvu to recover and receive reinforcements before the invasion of Okinawa.<br /><br />I was moved by this book, it is an accompaniment to books such as 'Helmet for My Pillow', by Robert Leckie. This book is the front-line experiences of hitting a beach, engaging in dreary work parties, such as the ones collecting rotting coconuts for disposal away from bivouac areas and also the constant discomfort of living and doing battle in the South Pacific. From burning sun to knee deep mud, plus dealing with various jungle animal nasties to a determined and well-entrenched enemy to whom surrender was not an option. As the story of Peleliu and later, Okinawa, unfold from the author's account, the reader experiences the transformation of a young man who has experienced the mounting savagery of close quarter combat. He describes struggling off an AMTRAC, to sitting in a hole in a dark jungle, with various unnerving night sounds from animals, to a knife-wielding enemy soldier who tries to infiltrate the defensive perimeter of the Marines. Then there are the conditions, they exact a terrible toll on personnel from infections to sickness. Sledge describes removing his socks one day to discover the socks also removing the skin on the soles of his feet and the putrid smell of his socks being so bad he simply buries them to get rid of the stench.<br /><br />In summary, a well written account of one man's experiences in the Pacific during some of the most horrendous battles of the war. While many of these moments are filled with horror and destruction, they should also give a resolution that the world must move forward and not revert to the loss of life described in this book. This book was written from the perspective of a man who survived some of the most savage fighting in World War Two and is book from the front line. Well done, E.B.

B003WSFXKY|3.0|Not surprising to read such a wide array of opinions on this release, but one's appreciation (or apathy) towards it is entirely dependent on what your expectations are.    I have been a stone-cold apostle of Carlos since my early years- the man's music has meant a great deal to me.  Having seem him live countless times over the years,(where he typically shines) I can be the gent's strongest advocate as well as his harshest critic.  Without going into a thesis-like examination of his legacy, my take on this release approaches a somewhat bittersweet perspective.    While I long for the days of experimentation and raw passion that produced records like Abraxas and Caravanserai, I'm deft enough to realize that unless Carlos once again decides to break with the desire for \\"commercial\\" exposure, records like this are going to be the ones to end his recorded legacy.  It's a shame, because it's all the more apparent that what made him so popular in the first place is becoming all the more diluted.  Unlike some, I love Supernatural- it's a record that has integrity- regardless of what demographic it appealed to.  But each subsequent \\"star\\" event has focused less on Carlos and more on some pretty mediocre participants and material.  Which brings us to this new entry:    I like the concept, but I would have went in a completely different direction.  Instead of focusing on singers to tandem with, it should have been....GUITARISTS!  Well, some would say \\"bad idea\\"...why take Carlos away as the focus?  Well, given a healthy attitude by performers and producers alike, it could have been killer.    How about Derek Trucks and Carlos waxing on?  Warren Haynes?  Eric Johnson?  Satch?  Joe Bonamassa?  Jeff Beck?  Steven Wilson?  David Hidalgo?  Jimmy Page?  Gary Moore?  Marc Ford?  No disrespect to Chris Daughtry ( who seems like a very nice guy) but \\"Photograph?  But I digress-    While I had serious misgivings, I have to admit that I enjoyed my listen- in fact, the track I dreaded turned out to be one of my favorites- Back in Black.  It's Carlos simply blazing away on an arrangement that I never could have envisioned. It's the freshest take on any of the songs here- which to my ears makes it quite enjoyable.    All in all, it's an entertaining listen, and I do appreciate the fact that Carlos is given plenty of room to stretch out on his instrument.  Perhaps one day, instead of Clive Davis leading the way, I'll get Bill Laswell- I can still hope!
0312600844|4.0|Someone once told me that the sign of a really good book is one that you continue to think about long after the reading is finished and I think that is the case with \\"Freedom.\\"  The story revolves around four main characters:  Walter and Patty, a married couple with two children, Walter's best friend, Richard; and Joey, Walter and Patty's son.  Walter and Patty also have a daughter, Jessica but she is a secondary character in the story.  The strength of the book is in the character development and how the story of their intertwining lives is told.  The characters are believable with all their strengths and flaws exposed and that is what kept me turning the pages and then to read it a second time, lest I missed something the first time around.
0920668364|3.0|I have two boys, ages 9 and 5.  After reading this book (and crying just a little), I was very anxious to read this story to my 5 year old son at bedtime thinking he would love the story as well.  I could not have been more WRONG.  At the end of the book, I looked over at him and he was crying and continued to cry for another 30 minutes.  He told me how didn't like the story because the song was so sad - \\"I'll love you forever, I'll like you for always, As long as I'm living, My baby you'll be.\\"  After I was able to calm him enough for him to fall asleep, I went to my older son's room (who had been listening to me read the story to his brother) and I told him about what had just happened.  He told me that his brother didn't like the song because it said \\"As long as I'm living\\" and that it made him sad to think that Mommy will die one day.  I did not stop to think of the story from his perspective and the book has been put away for good.      It is a touching story of the love between a mother and child, but I think it was more for my benefit than his.
B000002O7C|4.0|I really love the original \\"hymn to red october\\" in russian, from the movie. so far all ive been able to find is an english version (thats all they have on itunes or amazon mp3). is the version on this cd the russian movie version? thanks!
0143118420|5.0|Grab a box of chocolates and settle in for a wonderful read.      I loved this book and found myself highlighting passages because of the insights. It is more spiritual than religious and delicious in the descriptions of the people and places.  And on top of that, it is funny, sad, joyous and real. I experienced all those and many more emotions as I read the book.  I thoroughly enjoyed it and recommend it to one and all.
0345505387|1.0|Not what I expected at all - tries to be titilating in some graphics and only diminishes the storyline to some kind of cheap dimestore romance novel.  Don't waste your money - buy the real book!
B003XX2PPO|2.0|If you're looking for another Latin Pop CD, this one may be for you.  I have been a fan of Luis Miguel for years, and have always been 'turned off' by his overall Latin Pop style.  I prefer his romantic ballads and beautiful lyrics.  I saw this CD at the store today and almost bought it...the cover and the song titles looked good.  Then I hesitated, put it back, deciding that I should go home and listen online first.  Good decision! Decided NOT to buy it. Way too much Pop (60%).  Now his \\"Complices\\" CD...that's a 5 out of 5!!
0439023513|1.0|My daughter was so excited about getting this book but was very disappointed in it.  Loved the first two but recommended that I only read them and not bother with this one.
0345505387|1.0|Wow!  I was hoping for a real novel that described Jamie's feelings for Claire and what he had to go through to be with her.  I really wanted to hear his side of the story from the beginning.  I don't even care to read The Exile at all and I bought the stupid book.  I can't even get it to mesh in my mind with what I read in Diana Gabaldon's Outlander series.  It's like a crossover from a novel to a comic book.  Jamie and Claire look more like they came from the Orient!  This is a real stinker of a let down.  I have read and purchased just about all of her books (and all from The Outlander series) but from now on, I will be really careful about what I order.  I do not have money to waste on comic books!    Rebe
193604126X|1.0|I'm a PG Wodehouse fan, and have the nice penguin paperbacks for several of his books. I just received in the mail a very bizarre offprint. It's poorly printed on 8.5x11 paper. What the????
B0030IIZ3S|5.0|Toy story 2 is as expected is entertaining and educative. It has a good story and plot. I strongly recommend this movie to everybody.
B003DKJ5ZU|4.0|When I went back to check the original trailer, wow, was I surprised. It was more like a collection of deleted scenes. No old-time camera, no mean girl capturing Tink in a jar, no scenes of poor Tink trapped and needing her friends to rescue her. Apparently there are two entirely separate movies, and version 2.0 is what got released.     With good reason. The first version might have been more dramatic, but it wouldn't have been pleasant for the kiddies to see Tink helpless, sad, and in real danger. I guess we'll have to wait for the \\"Director's Cut\\" to see the original. :)     Another reason behind the script change might have been to showcase the upbeat fantasy of a human girl interacting with a fairy. Kind of a downer if the fairies never trust humans again.     That said, the animation is first rate, the story is good, and the entire movie is very colorful to watch.     As for extras, I was expecting a making-of video, but no dice. Based on what happened to the storyline, a behind-the-scenes look might have been traumatic.
B003XKPPOU|5.0|Toy Story 3 has as usual a good plot and a good story. The movie is really entertaining and in some way educative. I will surely purchase the disc when it becomes available.
0321701763|2.0|I bought this book because I needed it for class, but if you don't have to buy it, I am sure there might be better options out there. The book has exercises and shows you how to do certain things, but if you are a beginner, like me, this book is not very helpful. On the other hand, the videos on the DVD are really good and helpful but they are not that many and they only cover like the first three chapters.
B0036EH3XE|1.0|Lost was meant to be a show about plane crash victims in purgatory who would finally die.  It was a brilliant concept.  However, when the producers were promised big bucks and multiple seasons, they made a mess of it.  We all bought into it and hung on for the final episode...and what a disappointment it was.  The one star is for Matthew Fox's acting in that final episode...it was so tragic and unsettling that it was a relief to see him on the Jimmy Kimmel show right after the final episode aired.  He should have won the Emmy.
B002WCLG48|1.0|Listen this is an ok bit of art but from the books and everything this is a poor Japanese knock off. They have the culture of Halo all wrong. Its ok to wacth but just rent it dont buy it
B002Q4U9YU|5.0|The movie was great and the CD is the same.  All your favorite songs that take you back and make you smile.  It also reminds you that Michael Jackson wrote the soundtrack for our lives these last 40 years.  We'll miss that.
B003UYUQZW|5.0|I really enjoyed this movie a lot of action and a good storyline although not really original. The fact that it did not include vulger language was a real plus. I have seen all of jerry bruckhimer films and this one did not disappoint. A  good film for the entire family.
0345505387|1.0|She had me from Book One-(Outlander) but lost me on this one-I only wish I had checked it out further before buying it- It's a disappointing short story compared to her wonderful storytelling skills ( not to mention only 227 pages long)in her series novels which I had to wait years in between for and then jumped at to find out what happened next and next and next- Frankly with this one, I don't know why she bothered- it was like she just sat down and \\"got it out of the way.\\" I feel used.
B003PIUBZS|5.0|I first caught this series when it premiered on Starz.  The first episode, I have to admit, kind of turned me off the show for a while. But someone convinced me to continue watching it and so I spent the rest of that weekend watching it. I will say this, the first couple of episodes makes it a little difficult to keep interest, but after that the whole season explodes in a epic proportions.  From that point on I was hooked. I was so amazed by the originality and the twists of plots that I watched the season twice. I couldn't get enough of it. And the men weren't so bad to look at either. If you love action, devious plots, and epic battles this is definitely a series you should not pass up.
B0015DROBO|2.0|The hype for \\"The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo\\" was so relentless that I finally broke down and bought it for my ereader. What a disappointment! I slogged through the first half of the book, barely able to continue on. I know we are programmed to \\"like\\" what everyone else says is awesome, wonderful, or a terrific read, but I can't pretend. It was just plain boring.<br />If you have a hard time falling asleep during the day but think a nap would be a good use of your time--buy this book!<br />There was so much telling and explaining and barely any dialogue. For the first 50 pages I thought I was reading the Financial Times or the records from a bank. Really? We needed to know all the boring details of how banks and businesses and government work together to screw people over. Haven't heard enough of that on the news?<br />So, in all good conscience I can't give a thumbs up to this novel. Although it may be a great lead-in to the sequels. I have no idea. I'm sure I won't be tempted to throw away my money on those as well.<br />Since all the other reviews are written by people that loved, loved, loved this book, I just wanted to give a differing viewpoint. One that I've actually heard from many people that don't apparently write reviews. Buyer beware!
0515141429|5.0|This is one of the most exciting crime thrillers I have read. Every chapter ends with suspense. The reader is constantly surprised by the twists in the plot line and the protagonist is amazingly written.

B0036EH3XE|5.0|Title says it all, yes the ending divided the fans of those who loved it and those who hated it. Me I loved it, couldnt ask for a better ending. Now the dvd has a ton of special features including a minisode that takes place after the finale with some of characters answering unanswered questions. Good commentaries except...there wasnt any for the finale. How can you have a commentary for an episode like Dr. Linus but not for The End?    Besides that each of the special features were very good to watch    Special Features:    Commentary for episodes:  LAX  Dr. Linus  Ab Aeterno  Across the Sea    *The New Man In Charge - Learn some of the unanswered questions on lost with a minisode that features some of the characters.  * THE END: Crafting A Final Season - A documentary on making the final season  * A Hero's Journey - A short documentary on hero aspects of each characters  * See You In Another Life, Brotha - Info on the flashsideways  * LOST On Location - Some behind the scenes stuff of certain episodes  * LOST in 8:15 - A recap of seasons 1-5 in 8 minutes and 15 seconds  * LOST Bloopers  * Deleted Scenes    Easter eggs:    Disc 5    *On Sneak Peaks press left on the menu title to watch a gag video of the possibility of a cop show with Mathew Fox and a producer called \\"Bulletproof\\"    *On episodes click right onto Jacob's head to watch the cast play around the submarine sinking scene    *On Jacob's head click right onto disc 5 for behind the camera on the Charlie/Desmond under water scene    *On Setup click right and hit enter to watch a clip of Lepidus on the submarine and filming the scene
B003MZ0I84|1.0|This 3rd album is quite a disappointment; there's nothing new here and I had the impression that I was listening to theit 1st record.... Tasteless songs except for the 1st one and the cover. The rest of the CD brings no surprise; Maroon 5 can only play Maroon 5 and it seems to me that they're having problems rejuvenating their music. Sad that such good musicians are making commercial stuff.

B00127RAJY|5.0|First I bought this work out from Amazon, and was about 8 days in to it, didn't loose any wieght, but I could see a physical difference, so I new I had burned fat and gained muscle. Although, being a woman, seeing that scale not budge was just irritating!I saw Jillian's \\"Burn Fat, Boost Matabolism\\" work out for $9 at Wal-Mart,figured it would be a sound investment and so I paired it with the \\"Thirty Day Shred\\" in the morning after I take my daughter to school,then \\"Burn the Fat\\" about an hour before I get ready or work in the afternoon. I have so much energy to get me through the day now! Also, I'm moving to workout 2 on \\"Thirty Day\\", and between them both plus a decent modified diet partially gleened from P90X (Which also works, but its super time consuming!) I have lost 7 pounds so far, and thats even with cheating on my diet twice so far!(I manage a Pizza Hut at clsong shift, and miss dinner frequently) I also try very hard not to eat after six pm, and drink tones of water.Although something that has helped me is to get a really big bottle of water and just carry it around with you, I drank lots more water when I had the bottled filled up, sitting beside me on the end table or at dinner than I did just grabbing a cup and filling it every so often.

B003V5PPZG|5.0|Linkin park was always one of my favorite artists. There music was always what I was blasting in my ears. Although I'm more of a \\"hardcore\\" music lover, I did want LP to go into more heavy music. I have to say without a doubt that this Cd is one of the bands greatest creations. Even If you like Linkin parks previous albums, you should still respect the band for having the guts to move on to this style. I love the album. Buy it.
B0021L8V1Q|3.0|It was a fun movie overall, as expected.  The action and high tech tone was overdone but still entertaining. is a common problem in higher budget movies, and one can quibble that nobody except Downey gets sufficient screen time to make a compelling impression. As self absorbed rich guy Tony Stark, the actor has to fight with no less than three villains, two other figures who are intentionally put on a nebulous fence between good and evil, the mysterious director of a clandestine organization called S.H.I.E.L.D. and a love interest designed to be either a sharp, take-charge businesswoman or a helpless damsel in the needyest sense,  depending on the plot unwindingness. The story picks up Stark about 5 months after the ending of the first film as he boasts to a rapt audience at the re-instituted Stark Expo how he has maintained world peace with his impenetrable suit of armor. However, underneath his hubris, Stark hides the fact that he is dying from poisoning by the palladium core in the arc reactor that gives him not only his unique powers but his re-born life. Meanwhile, crazy bird loving Russian physicist Ivan Vanko is planning revenge against Stark for the act of betrayal he feels Stark's father committed against his dying arms-dealer father. In fact, Vanko has designed his own arc reactor with the intent of destroying Stark, an act almost realized at the Circuit de Monaco. Stark's smarmy business rival, fellow weapons manufacturer Justin Hammer, will stop at nothing to secure the secret to Stark's armored suit,  Stern of Pennsylvania wants Stark prosecuted for crimes against the state. On the fence about Stark is a carryover from the first storyline, Lt. Colonel James , whose friendship with the billionaire is severely tested by Stark's self destructive behavior. A new character, Natalie Rushman, is shown in an shady manner as a new assistant to replace Pepper Potts, Stark's feisty gal Friday-turned-CEO. Natalie's motivations are revealed in due time. It all comesto a head at the expo where Vanko and Hammer have colluded to produce an aerial battle scene that is way overdone but still fun.
B002VPE1XE|3.0|This camera case seems well constructed and is a fair value for the price.  It is larger than needed for my Panasonic Lumix camera.  In fact it would fit both my camera and my Flip camcorder if there were a divider to keep the two separated.  I am not wild about the velcro flap closure.  It leaves some pretty big gaps and if you were tempted to use that extra space by keeping anything else in with the camera it could fall out.  Of course there is a zipper pocket for small stuff so that may not be an issue for you.  It has either a velcro strap for attaching to a belt or a wrist strap.  I consider a neck/shoulder strap to be essential in a camera bag and this does not include one nor does its design lend itself to the addition of one.  This will not replace my existing camera bag though I think it will be ideal to strap to the handlbars of my bike where the strap of my other bag would get in the way.      In summation, I'd only recommend this bag if you have a larger size camera and prefer to carry it in your hand/purse/pocket rather than over your shoulder.      Amazon Vine note:  the small and fabulous \\"frustration free\\" packaging of this item was shipped to me in a box about 20x too big with tons of wasted packagaing materials :(
0451228375|5.0|Ken Follett is one of the best writers I've read.  He keeps the reader engaged while he takes you through several characters/scenarios within a chapter.  I've never been one to read much; however, Mr. Follett has recently changed all of that.  When I finished reading his, The Pillars of the Earth, I found I actually enjoyed such a lengthy book and looked forward to purchasing his follow-up novel World Without End.  Outstanding is all I can say about these novels and this author.
B002Z7FWBI|5.0|The Clint Eastwood \\"Dirty Harry\\" film series really gets down into the grime and grit of a large city anti-crime crusader.  This is a historic series that everyone should view for a glimpse of big city life and those who protect us.
0971407614|5.0|I always remember a football player friend telling me many many years ago that after he had been injured, he'd been put on a special program where he was only allowed to use bodyweight exercises to build strength and that he had originally laughed at the idea but after a couple of months of it was astounded to feel stronger and fitter than he'd ever felt in his life. This had always stuck in my head and I had often wondered about the validity of bodyweight exercise vs pumping weights.    So when I saw this book I thought it looked interesting enough to buy. I could never have envisaged the way it would change my life. When I was younger I had been a gym junkie and runner but - now at the age of 40 - hadn't done any real exercise for a few years. But this book has changed EVERYTHING! His workouts are amazing! The variety of exercises is staggering - and after 20 weeks of exercise, 5 days a week, I am STILL not bored! My body has gone from a flabby out of shape lump to firm, toned and lean as hell. Everyone I know has commented on the amazing transformation.     I started on the intermediate 10 week program and followed it religiously every day making sure I was quite careful with what I was eating as well - you DO need to lay off the junk food if you want to see results but hey, that should be no surprise to anyone. Then I went into the advanced 10 week program and am now just about to finish that. My strength gains have been phenomenal to say the least. I feel lean, mean and agile - probably more than I have ever felt in my life. I hoping to progress right through all the 10 week programs right through to Elite and then I'll start making my own up.    If you only buy one book on strength exercises, this should be IT! As long as you are disciplined and stick with it, it WILL CHANGE YOUR LIFE! Guaranteed!

B0025UHKNS|2.0|The touch bezel feature is a joke!  After locking multiple times (including one in the middle of a marathon), I finally contacted customer service and this was their response \\"Perspiration will affect the bezel of the Forerunner 405Cx, causing it to become unresponsive to your touch and sometimes causing the unit to randomly switch screens or beep\\". Their suggestion was awesome \\"lock the bezel during training\\".  I'm not sure if they know, but perspiration HAPPENS during training.   How come they didn't see this one coming? Who's the brilliant design engineer that didn't design a bezel perspiration resistant?  I was partially disappointed with the product, but I'm am EXTREMELY disappointed with customer service trying to insult my intelligence with their solutions.  Will not buy EVER again!!
0439023513|5.0|Folks that don't like this book, don't like the ending.  They want some romantic ending, where the world is fantastic, the girl and boy fail madly in love, and everything is puppies and rainbows.  Collins, by not playing into the formula adopted by other silly, romance YA, has treated YA readers as the complicated and sophisticated readers they are.  Katniss doesn't pick Gale or Peeta; she picks herself and her survival above all.  Its brillant, its true, and its uncomfortable.  Collins makes us face the complexities of self-interest and selfishness mirrored in Katniss.  Bravo Collins and bravo to your editor for not hemming you in.
B003JTHETY|4.0|This is a good Iron Maiden album but the album has one wrinkle.  The opening song is actually two songs.  I remember seeing the video for 'final frontier' and thinking this is awesome.  I can't wait to get the album.  But once the cd starts you get treated to a rather long meandering intro called satellite 15.  Ugh.  It's kind of like Judas Priest's the Helion but longer not very good and you can't skip over it.  Satellite 15...boring.  Other than that, good stuff.
0395645662|5.0|I LOVE this book. I have probably read it between 10-15 times. It has a subtle & simplistic darkness about it. It's about a too-perfect futuristic world that's devoid of pain, emotion, choice & even memories. No one ever knows what happened in the world before them or what happens when they leave it. History is completely lost to all but one man; the giver. The Giver's job is to hold & endure those memories & then a successor is chosen; Jonas. Jonas slowly learns the truth about the underlying horrors of the 'perfect' world he used to be apart of. He gets to finally feel for the 1st time in his life, emotions like happiness & love, but also has to experience all the tragedies of the 'old' world firsthand including emotional & physical pain. It gives you a new appreciation for the freedoms that we take for granted. It helps you to look at things a little differently. The journey that Jonas embarks on is fascinating w/ so many thought-provoking moments along the way. It's touching, humorous at times, & even shocking. All in all, a great book thats worth reading again & again!     Pick up this book & get ready to 'think'.
0312330537|5.0|One the of those rare books that, literally, transports you.  I found myself [I'm one of those that skips pages] re-reading pages.  Didn't expect it to be so many pages but found myself disappointed at turning the last page of this \\"gem.\\" Loved the fluidity of the author's writing.  Best book I've read in 10 years.

B003UYUR10|3.0|When i started watching this movie, I was excited to see a familiar scene as from the video game that I have been playing.  Unfortunately, The movie fell short in my opinion.  The action scenes were entertaining, and fun to watch, but the overall comparison between movie and game were not there.

B003QNXPUK|1.0|I had a different screen protector, but I had this product recomended by some friends of mine. I bought it at its is the worst. It's good for the sides and the back but it does not look good for the screen. It creates more glare and air bubbles pop up every day. I removed it from my phone and put the old one back.   Don't waste your money on this. You can find cheaper ones that work better. The reason they are more expensive than others is not because its a better product but how much marketing they do for this product.
0553805371|1.0|I have read this book (hereafter simply `Hawking') three or four times and referred back to it several more times. My verdict is, that the book fails.<br /><br />In the subtitle the authors declare their aim to be to give `New Answers to the Ultimate Questions of life.'<br />On page 10 (repeated on p. 171 in the last chapter of the book) they declare the questions they shall be answering (I add the numbering):<br />\\"(1) Why is there something rather than nothing?<br />(2) Why do we exist?<br />(3) Why this particular set of laws and not some other?\\"<br /><br />They continue immediately (p. 10): \\"This is the Ultimate Question of Life, the Universe and Everything. We shall attempt to answer it in this book.\\"<br /><br />But surprisingly, on page 171 Hawking tells us: \\"The laws of nature tell us `how' [italics in text] the universe behaves, but they don't answer the `why?' [italics in text] questions that we posed at the start of this book.\\"<br /><br />Is there not an essential contradiction (and failure) here?<br />Also, I would like to rub a little salt into this wound in the book. If science cannot provide the ultimate answers, and if `philosophy is dead', what other discipline does Hawking know of, which will be able to do this explaining?<br /><br />[I point out that the British edition of this book, 'The Grand Design', has a dustcover with the crucially important subtitle:  'New Answers to the Ultimate Questions of Life'.  But the American edition, the one displayed here on amazon.com, has a different dustcover, which omits this subtitle.  Is it because the American publishers realized that Hawking's book fails totally to answer any of 'the ultimate questions of life', and that therefore the British subtitle is a complete nonsense?]<br /><br />In addition to this fundamental admission that his book will not (indeed, cannot) deliver what it had said it would deliver, there are at least three other fundamental failures in Hawking's book.<br /><br />(1) Something from nothing? Hawking repeats several times that there is a `spontaneous quantum creation of the universe' (see his index, under `Creation'). I quote (p.8): \\"M-theory predicts that a great many universes were created out of nothing. Their creation does not require the intervention of some supernatural being or god. Rather these multiple universes arise naturally from physical law. They are a prediction of science.\\" I ask: where does this physical law come from, and the `science' that predicts it, seeing that these universes are to emerge from nothing? On page 136: \\"On this view [Feynman, no-boundary condition, etc.] the universe appeared spontaneously, starting in every possible way.\\" Page 137, the caption to an illustration: \\"Multiverse Quantum fluctuations lead to the creation of tiny universes out of nothing.\\" Page 180: \\"Because there is a law like gravity, the universe can and will create itself from nothing in the manner described in chapter 6 [Choosing Our Universe]. Spontaneous creation is the reason there is something rather than nothing, why the universe exists, why we exist. It is not necessary to invoke God to light the blue touch paper and set the universe going.\\" For me, Hawking has said absolutely nothing that proves that \\"the universe can and will create itself from nothing\\". Where did this `blue touch paper' come from?<br /><br />(2) Who and what and why are we? Hawking eliminates from serious consideration what must be the central feature of any Grand Design: explaining the self-conscious, rational, scientific, logical, philosophizing, theologizing, artistic, musical, literary, remembering, planning, loving, hating, altruistic, selfish, moral, immoral, peak-of-creation human being. With a wave of the hand, he dismisses any possibility that mankind is \\"More than Matter\\" (to use the title of a 2010 book by Keith Ward). On page 181, in the last paragraph of the book, Hawking says: \\"We human beings ... are ourselves mere collections of fundamental particles of nature.\\" This is a totally unfounded declaration of faith in materialism which, like `self-creation out of nothing', Hawking cannot support by any proof. On this point, Hawking is simply totally dismissive. For him, `we' (I must assume that he means humankind) are of no real importance. What matters for him are multiverses and quarks, not human beings. See my next point.<br /><br />(3) What of free will? For Hawking, human beings have no free will. Having declared on page 5 that `philosophy is dead', Hawking in fact uses it all the time. Apart from using logic as a constant tool, on pages 32/33 (repeated on page 178) he makes the astonishing claim that human beings have no free will. Hawking says: \\"It is hard to imagine how free will can operate if our behaviour is determined by physical law, so it seems that we are no more than biological machines and that free will is just an illusion\\" (p. 32). But has Hawking proved that our behaviour is determined by physical law? Unbelievably, he hasn't even attempted to do so. He simply says that it is. For Hawking, the only reason why humans seem to have free will is that, to be able to predict every single tiniest human action according to these `laws of nature' by which, for Hawking, humans are inescapably governed, \\"we would need a knowledge of the initial state of each of the thousand trillion trillion [is that 10 to the power of 27?] molecules in the human body and to solve something like that number of [mathematical] equations. That would take a few billion years ... [but] because it is so impractical to use the underlying physical laws to predict human behaviour, we adopt what is called an effective theory, based on the notion of free will plus the assumption that people evaluate their possible alternative courses of action and choose the best.\\" For Hawking, `free will' is not really a `fundamental feature, but [merely] an effective theory, an admission of our inability to do the calculations that would enable usto predict human actions'. Has Hawking been pre-programmed inescapably from the Big Bang to write his books on cosmology? And have I been genetically programmed, inescapably, from the Big Bang, by the laws of nature, in 10 to the power of 27 tiny steps, to make the judgment that Hawking's view here is utter nonsense? And why does my judgment differ from Hawking's? Again, is every prisoner in jail the victim of tyranny, because he could not help committing his crimes?<br /><br />CONCLUSION<br />Hawking says (p. 5, his first page of text) that people have always asked \\"How can we understand the world in which we find ourselves? How does the universe behave? What is the nature of reality? Where did all this come from? Did the universe need a creator?\\" He goes on immediately: \\"Traditionally these are questions for philosophy, BUT PHILOSOPHY IS DEAD (my emphasis). Philosophy has not kept up with modern developments in science, particularly physics\\". But on the contrary, Keith Ward says: People really want to know if the natural sciences are the only ways of finding out the truth, and if there is any way of reasonably resolving the ethical dilemmas that modern medicine puts before us\\" (p. 188). As Ward frequently points out, eminent philosophers (and I add, eminent scientists like Hawking) who deny that they have any philosophy, or even deny that there is such a thing as philosophy, are really holding that view because that is their considered philosophical view - philosophy is inescapable for rational humankind.<br /><br />For reasons of space, I must short-circuit Hawking's discussion of the origin of the laws of nature. He hypothesizes about Feynman's diagrams, multiverses with their 10 to the power of 500 possibilities (actualities?), String Theory, the Game of Life, and M-theory, in order to explain why there is this particular set of laws and not some other. I do not know to what extent Hawking carries the cosmological establishment with him on this question.<br /><br />Essentially, Hawking has written a book of cosmology, while throwing in, at intervals, totally misconceived philosophical considerations. For me, this book marks a watershed in the science/religion/philosophy debate. The case Hawking makes out, once he steps outside the realms of `pure' science, is as bad as I believe it can get.<br /><br />What is certain is that his Grand Design, by omitting any serious discussion of rational mankind, is Hamlet without the Prince of Denmark  -  the central and supremely important character in the 'play' of The Universe is missing!
B001GKYBXA|5.0|We should all be happy at 67 searching for whatever it is that McCartney is searching for.<br /><br />Vocals are amazing and this guy is absolutely scorching the industry.<br />This album will get it's fair share of criticism but so did RAM.<br /><br />Everyone buried RAM and now they reference it as the greatest solo guitar work that was ever done.<br /><br />Rock on Paul....it's better than 90% of the crap that is out there!
B003JTHETY|5.0|I could chatter on for a while about how great this album is, but I'll keep it short.  This is Maiden's best work since Brave New World, hands down.  Where that record focused on tight, \\"normal-length\\" songs, this one relives the epic grandeur of classics like \\"Rime of the Ancient Mariner.\\"  More than half the tracks are over 7 minutes, but they never feel over-long.  In fact, I often find myself wishing they'd go on a little longer.  Because of the complexity of the songs, though, the album takes a little effort to get into at first -- a friend advised me to wait for a second listen before passing judgment, and he was right.  The first listen, I thought \\"This is okay;\\" the second, I went away humming \\"The Talisman\\" for two days straight.    So, awesome album -- buy immediately.
B000WQWPKA|5.0|\\"Independence Day\\" is one of Hollywood's best action/disaster films of all-time. Filled with remarkable special effects and a good script, \\"Independence Day\\" has gone on to be not only a beloved thrill-ride movie, but one of the biggest blockbusters in movie-making history making over $800,000,000 on a $75,000,000 budget.<br /><br /> The film is about a group of aliens who wreck havoc on mankind, killing people and destroying buildings, as humans fight desperately to save themselves from being destroyed by these evil forces. \\"Independence Day\\" is a combination of the movies \\"Close Encounters of the Third Kind\\", \\"The Day After Tomorrow\\", and many of the neat disaster epics from the seventies, but produced on a much more high-scaled level where money was obviously no object for the studio: the producers wanted to make an extraordinary \\"disaster\\" film, and they succeeded. Both terrifying and jaw-dropping, \\"Independence Day\\" leaves the viewer wondering \\"could this really happen someday?\\".<br /><br /> The bonuses in this edition include 9 minutes of restored features, commentary by director Roland Emmerich, a 30-minute documentary on the making of \\"Independence Day\\", an HBO feature entitled \\"First Look: Independence Day\\" a 33 minute feature hosted by Jeff Goldblum, plus much more.
B003F3NDP8|3.0|There are still some good parts but its just not as good as it was and the fact that gabby has chubby kids  (because she is so beautiful and thin) is very funny until you think about how bad it is for the girls. I almost hope it is camera trickery that makes them look so big. (I realize its most likely not). A couple of laughs are not worth hurting their health besides that its still enjoyable to watch.

0891419063|5.0|The vast majority of military books are written by the Generals who look at and analyse battles and wars from a \\"chess board\\" perspective; move this corps, support this division , bring up the reserve battalion , watch the flanks, call in an air strike, bomb the planned assault area. Good reading, but they do not go to the front, charge over ground that only the infantry do, sometimes without support knowing that this could be their last day.<br />\\"With the Old Breed\\" does for WW2 what \\"All Quiet in the Western Front\\" did for WW1. This has to be the most gripping and honest book about two of the most horrific battles of WW2. The reader can smell the death, the fear , the hunger and the filth.<br />It further reinforces that the generation that fought WW2 was the greatest generation of them all. They went through a depression, fought this terrible war and then went on to rebuild  great nations. My and future generations owe them  a debt we can never repay.

0811876373|5.0|I thought this book was fun yet practical step-by-step guide to making cake pops. The design is beautiful and well thought out in particular the photography and spiral binding are a winner.  It would make a perfect gift for friends or family. My only criticism would be the amount of repetition in the book. For example it mentioned using a quarter of the cake and icing to make only 12 pops several times through out the book. I presume this is to stretch the amount of pages/content that could be produced for what is essentially a pretty simple process. I am a long time fan of Bakerella and her website and think this book does her justice.

159448385X|5.0|This was one of the most powerful and upsetting books I have read in a long time.  I felt it brought the reader into the desperation and hopelessness of people caught between savage factions without a stable central government.<br /><br />The book raises the direct concern that women are continually treated as second class citizens who do not think the same way as men (Thank God).  Although this may be a cultural norm, one questions when \\"inhuman\\" treatment becomes \\"subhuman\\".<br /><br />Much has been written about this book that I will not repeat.  I only want to recommend it to readers who want to expand their world view and realize that there is much primitive behavior that occurs in this so called modern age.<br /><br />As I review the comments of others, I was struck by some of the reviewers that gave this book a \\"1 star\\" based on the depressive and disturbing message.  Those details are the very reason that I gave the book \\"5 stars\\".  I think everyone must be aware of the reality of others.  After reading this book, I view the news broadcasting of the conflicts in Afganistan with greater interest and ponder if there ever will be emerging peace.
030726999X|5.0|was really a good book. so sorry to see the story stop here.  but worth the read.  this author writes a terrific plot and he keeps the action moving from book to book ..  i loved it.  wish there were more of these .

0385341008|1.0|I found this book to be hard to follow therefore hard for me to finish.  The story would have been better told as a story rather than in the form of letters.  The letters seemed to be random and if you did not read the book from front to back in one sitting, it was easy to forget all the characters.
B001YYQ9SS|4.0|Overall, you get what you pay for. A HD version of Final Fantasy Advent Children. This version adds additional footage which, I think, make the movie better. The only negative thing about the blu-ray is that the case seems weaker and thinner than traditional blu-ray cases and there is no insert with the movie. Other than that, this blu-ray is a great buy for anyone who is a fan of FFVII and HD movies.
B003O86MY8|5.0|Garrett's music is hair raising.  I haven't connected to music like this for a long time.  I love this CD.
B0032JTV74|5.0|When an Ohio high school glee club loses its director, Mr. Schuester, motivated by nostalgia for his own glee past and a looming early midlife crisis, volunteers to take over.  Whatever romantic notions he may have had, however, quickly diminish as he is confronted with one problem after another.  First, the school is starved for funds and the glee club will have a very limited budget.  Second, the delightfully wicked cheer coach abhors the idea that anyone might steal money or glory from her squad so she opposes his every move and plots against him.  Third, the larger than life personalities of the few students interested in glee are bound to clash.  Fourth, because there is a mandatory minimum club size for competition, he must recruit new members - no easy task when the perception is that glee kids are losers.  Fifth, if the club does not place at regionals, it will be disbanded.  Sixth, among their competition is the notorious Vocal Adrenaline, \\"soulless automatons\\" who perennially win nationals.    Set in this context, the real drama unfolds.  The show takes real-life situations (teen pregnancy, sexual identity, unraveling marital ties, relationships, peer pressure, belonging) and then adds absurd twists sending them well over the top (virginal 16-year old does not understand the nuances of how a baby is conceived, ditzy blond thinks cat is reading her journal, slushies are tossed in students' faces regularly in the school hallways).  All the viewer can do is suspend disbelief and enjoy the ride.  All cast members, often more caricatures than characters, behave badly at one time or another (regularly for some) but their charm is irresistible.  They are so darn likable all one can do is embrace them and await the next outlandish act.  The show's real success is that in the midst of these zany overblown situations, there are profoundly touching and heart-warming moments that are equally authentic.    Each episode features a few music numbers.  Some are staged aspart of a glee club rehearsal or performance, others arise more organically from the drama (some are both).  A staggering array of genres are represented: show tunes, rock n' roll, pop, R&B, Rap; classic and contemporary pieces for each.  The choreography sizzles with energy and excitement.  The cast appears to be having a blast and it is highly contagious.    Regarding the Blu-ray set, it is disappointing that there is no content listing (which episodes are on which disks) on or in the packaging.  This can be easily rectified, however, with a homemade addition if desired.  While the picture and sound quality are better than on a standard DVD, it may not be as good as it could be.    Despite the package's shortcomings, it is the best quality production available of a terrific show and a treasure to possess.
030745455X|5.0|loved this book.  second in the trilogy, but soon as i finished it i had to read the third book it left you in an exciting place.  this author can really spin a plot. be prepared to want to read these three books in one sitting.
1416550550|5.0|I am a huge reader of historical fiction, anything old, Brontes, Austin, Dickins, etc.  I always read the Amazon reviews before I buy a book but I never reviewed a book myself.  I can't imagine not sharing my feelings with everyone. I am now giving this book to friends and/or demanding that they read it.  I sat every day and night reading this book. I couldn't put it down. When the mystery of Nell's mother finally came to light I got goosebumps and cried like a baby.  I was so very happy.  I managed to hold it together until the final chapter and the lost it at the very end.  I was happy, sad, overjoyed, relieved, emotional, content, overwhelmed and so very grateful that Kate Morton was able to tell such a tale.  The fairy tales within the book are amazing.  Their every word relates to the actual story.  The best word to describe this book is \\"beautiful.\\"  This makes picking up another book to read quite difficult.  The story will remain in my head and in my dreams for some time to come.
B003VQM2M4|2.0|THASH, 3 OR 4 GOOD SONGS, THE REST IS TRASH, SAME AS THE 1ST CD, N THE SAME GOES 4 THE LAST BADSEEDS CD , AND I LOVE,  THE B.S !!I THINK NICK IS RUNNING OUT IDEAS, SAD 2 SAY, I HOPE IM WRONG.
B0034G4OVS|4.0|First, for an independent movie, I was very impressed with the quality. Scenery was great, the shots were great, the directing was great.<br /><br />This is a survival movie, about 3 young people stuck on a ski lift. It was suspenseful, somewhat plausible, and I hope to see more of this director & cast.<br /><br />There were some problems. First, the emotional scenes (the \\"confessions\\", the romance back-story, etc) were not good. The acting wasn't up to par. I was bored during those moments, & never cared about the development of the characters as much as the development of the plot.<br /><br />And, there was SO MUCH they could have done with the plot, and they dropped the ball a little here. ---SOME MINOR SPOILERS BELOW--<br /><br />There are many survival aspects that were ignored here (not knowing exactly where this happened). First, the extreme cold, which came into play ... but during the day, they were exposed to enough sun at high altitudes to get a major dose of radiation poisoning & dehydration.<br /><br />Also, the snow seemed really groomed & packed, which didn't seem plausible at all, especially under a remote chair lift in a remote area of the park. I was expecting to see 6-8 feet of powder, and it should have been difficult to stand up in it (especially if they had thrown off their skis & snowboard).<br /><br />And, as some reviewers have mentioned, the use of ravenous wolves was kindof a cop-out and stood out as the most unrealistic part of the plot. It became very reminiscent of [[ASIN:B00064AE0G Open Water]] from a few years ago - which was a decent movie. But both movies devolved into a \\"man vs. animal\\" instead of a broader, more interesting premise of \\"man (or woman) vs. nature\\".<br /><br />Overall, though, I give it a 3.5 stars and would recommend it to someone who likes survival, suspense, or independent movies, especially if you are a skier or snowboarder.
B002ZG977Y|2.0|What a huge disappointment.  The special effects and the first movie (with Harry Hamlin) attracted me to this movie.  But the bad script and the bad acting really surprised me.  I couldn't wait for this movie to end and I will not watch it again.  I suggest that you watch the original - much more fun and a hotter leading man!
B003V5PPZG|1.0|I waited 2 years for this? I was counting the days, since there's not much else I listen to anymore, and I wound up extremely disappointed. There's a couple of tolerable songs, and maybe they'll even grow on me, but the rest is just crap. Listen first, then buy the songs that you like, if any. You'll be extremely happy that you did. Chester needs to move on to another band, and I'll follow him wherever he goes.
B001R23FWA|3.0|Good content, but reading it in the Kindle app for iPad is almost impossible.  Holding the iPad in portrait orientation produces text in landscape layout; holding it in landscape orientation produces a portrait text layout.<br /><br />As I have no issue with dozens of other Kindle edition books read on my iPad, I attribute this to the book being ~66 years old and so probably scanned into Kindle.<br /><br />Very poorly done IMHO.
1572704497|5.0|I love all Agatha Christie's books but this by far my favorite!  The story keeps you listening well beyond your planned stopping point.  Hugh Fraser is simply wonderful as the reader!

B003XSWL3A|4.0|The US Essential S&G (10-14-2003) came with two discs: 16+17.  The UK Essential S&G (11-24-2003) also came  with two discs 20+20! Now the US 3.0 (8-31-2010) comes with 3 discs at 16+16+8  and gives us 41 tracks, the winner. UK Essential gives all the US tracks plus Bye Bye Love,He Was My Brother,Blessed (live),Punky's Dilemma and A Church Is Burning (live).  Of these, US 3.0 gives us Brother and Punky and in addition, April Come She Will, 7 O'Clock News/Silent Night,Why Don't You Write Me [Fun yes, essential?] and Citizen of the Planet.  Note 3.0's first two discs are identical to the original  US release AND the \\"booklet\\" is exactly the same.  Disc info for disc 3 is printed on the inside of the 3rd  of the 4 section cardboard (no plastic) cd \\"jacket\\".  While I really preferred the UK Essential I have to admit if you were to buy one, it should be 3.0 because it has BOTH the exceptional \\"My Little Town\\" *(songs don't get better than this!) AND the Paul Simon recording with Art added \\"Citizen of the Planet\\".  I'm still waiting for a future 4.0 which includes \\"Cuba, Si!, Nixon, No!\\", the [ probably wise] outtake from BRIDGE OVER TROUBLED WATER .But  after all these years, boys, how about  releasing it and letting us  be the judge?

B00003CX9W|5.0|This movie is a beautiful combination of audial and visual art; one of my favourites since I was a child. I love that it's on dvd now and I can watch it over and over again!
B003ELOQD4|4.0|Despite the many reviews that I have read - I think the Blu-Ray quality, video and audio, are amzaing.  I can definitely tell the difference between this and a standard DVD.  The concert itself is amazing and I think it authentically replicates any U2 show.  My complaints have already been addressed, but I'll rehash:<br /><br />1) The video is too \\"jumpy\\".  The director of this video needs to realize that it is o.k., and even preferable to keep a camera shot longer than 5 seconds.  Watching this can make you sick to the stomach.  It's better to \\"listen to this DVD\\" as opposed to \\"watching\\" it.  Of course, different people have differnt tastes, so maybe some others like this.  so I can forgive them for this.<br /><br />2) What is NOT unforgivable, and pretty stupid at that, is they cut out the first song of the show (\\"Breathe\\").  Now, when I first heard that, I figured that maybe there were recording problems with the song.  Then I found out it's included as \\"bonus\\" material!  OK, now THINK about this.  The song is NOT in the show, but included SEPARATELY as a bonus??  This makes absolutely no sense.  If you were going to do something this stupid, why pick the first song??  This song shows the dramatic entrance by the band which was a crucial part of the show!  I really can't believe this idiotic decision was made.  I'm hoping to find the answer somewhere.  Incredibly idiotic.<br /><br />Otherwise, great show.
0553805371|4.0|I've always like the way that Hawking has looked at the overall picture. a lot of his ideas are conjucture, sure, and a lot of them are really on the slopes of being really really vague. Still, the world is not a clock that can be set and neither is the universe. Hawkings shows what it is, or presumes to showcase what it might be, and i think that is amazing in some ways.<br /><br />In this, the issue of divinity is addressed somewhat, and some people don't seem to like it. I thought the addition here wasn't really saying much on the order of anything there, but people seemed to go crazy or to say that Hawking finally understood. I guess that shows that the open minds are sometimes relagated to time-outs and that the bully symdrome of being right or being shunned is still the way of thinking. consdering the material and what it is about, you would think that minds would have to be opened a little more.<br />Think - i guess that might be a hard word for some to carry.<br /><br />In the end, I liked the book but it seemed flawed. It took a little time to delve into, was dry in places, and did not seem like the Hawking I recall. It could be the time that has passed on my front or it could be something he hs done. Frankly, I thought it was him a bit, not standing when he should stand, but I am not the mind that makes the assumptions he does. I just read them, find it interesting, and hope for more.<br />There could have been a little of that as well, more I mean, but the world and what is out there isn't always limitless in some eyes.<br /><br />frustrating and yet enlightening - wouldn' think of the two as friends.
B002QH2NUA|5.0|Excellent dvd of the concert McCartney performed in NYC in 2009.DVD was well filmed and mainly focused on the performers and not the audience. Also,sound quality was excellent on dvd as well as on the two cd,s which were included. Highly recommended to Macca fans.
B00433TO52|5.0|Great find!!<br /><br />Let me start this review by saying I am a huge Shakespeare fan as well as being a huge Kindle fan and I was looking for a Kindle collection that had everything in it from him. Now, I already know all his plays and poems and works, or at least I thought I did. I mean, I wasn't aware of these apocryphal plays. I mean, I've always wondered if the plays that we all know were the only ones he ever wrote, but I'd never really gone to find out. When I read the title and description I just had to see what this was about.<br /><br />When I downloaded it, I must say I was so happy with this great find!! These additional plays were the first ones I went to look at and already  just paging through all these new ones, written at different times in his career, has been  so interesting!! I can't wait to get into them for real. I feel like I've gotten a new toy that I can play with!<br /><br />I highly recommend it!!
B002VPE1AW|5.0|Avatar  The box office hit Avatar; it not only features scenes of unimaginable picture but also extreme moments of action and intricate story telling. It involves magical themes, love stories, war, and family. The picture is about a soldier by the name Jake Sully who in the event of his brothers death must go to Pandora and become the driver for the \\"Avatar\\". In all irony he ends up growing a love for the indigenous people and their ways and sees that what the military is doing is false and completely immoral.  It all begins with Jake Sully (\\"a paralyzed soldier in the United States Marines\\") who in the event of his brothers must take place as the Avatar Driver. In 6 years time he reaches the planet Pandora and is briefed on his training immediately. He later meets Dr. Grace in which she protests at him for not being a scientist. Following he takes the Avatar out for the First time in which he experiences motor skills for the first time in many years. The next day he goes out into the jungle to explore the land and in the surprising chance he ends up being separated from his squad while being chased by a giant animal of the land, in which he turns out getting the indigenous people of the planet which is the military Colonels (\\" Colonel Miles's\\") goal all along in which he gets close to the people so that the humans can take over their land to obtain a rich and expensive metal known as unobtainium.  After getting close to the people and one Navi girl (\\"Neytiri\\") Jake realizes his wrong doing and wishes to patch things up but before so the military attacks the land after figuring out that he is too attached to the Navi people. As a result the Navi people are done with Jake but he comes up with the idea that I he captures Haruk Muk To (The lands largest and most fierce Banshee or flying dragon) that the people will except him once more. In which case he does and the land and Navi people are shocked because it has been unseen for at least a whole generation. The Navi people love their land more then we appreciate ours so they fly out and gather together to save the land itself in which they are all connected to. With many casualties a war goes on between the two in which many of the main characters pass away but with death comes new life and Jake completes his goal and saves the land and the Navi people from the Colonel and the greedy miners. He later is brought to the prayer tree and is made a permanent member of the Navi people trading his old body for a new.  The movie is very long and intricate but its themes will attract the eyes and attention of people from all walks because it is without a doubt a great piece of work. It isn't too long or empty at any point and it grabs your attention during the entire three hours of its duration. It is so picturesque at every moment and is bound to be the next best hit for generations to come

0307271862|2.0|This is a very deceptive book because it starts off in such a good way and then lets you down faairly quickly. That's the way I felt when I was reading it anyhow, with the first 20% or so of the book keeping me awake, the next 10% keeing a height above \\"good\\" but not at the beginning's statue, and then seeing it all crash. Its a sad thing when this happens, too, because you keep on reading, expecting something that isn't coming, knowing it has to be there. That's the way my time with the book went anyhow, with the beastie flashing a few scales and claiming to be a big fish when - when it wasn't.<br /><br />If you want to know a lot fo details about the book, then looka t the editorial. I hate writing negative reviews so I'll end this here. Maybe you can find soemthign redemptive in the story I did not.
B002QROIMG|4.0|This third book in Martin's \\"let's redefine epic\\" series is a worthy successor to the first two, in addition to being an excellent set of stories all its own.  The characters develop and change in many unexpected ways -- sometimes so unexpected as to be startling -- but the plot just keeps delivering the goods, the bads, and the very very uglies.<br /><br />Martin didn't get any more compassionate as time went on, and he's still willing to yank the rug out from under his readers with no warning.  One scene in particular upset me so badly that I had to put the book down for a several hours after it was over and pull myself together before I could go on reading.  Some stories progress faster than others.  Arya Stark in particular just wanders from place to place so long that it becomes a little unrealistic that she wouldn't have made it back to her family earlier than she does, and Bran Stark doesn't do much of anything interesting.  It'll be great when Martin finally reaches the point of THAT story.  On the other hand, the battle scenes at The Wall are everything a reader could hope for and Daenerys gets a deliciously awesome story that more than makes up for the boring odyssey she had in the last book.<br /><br />Most interesting of all are the stories of the two Lannister brothers, Jaime and Tryrion.  Jaime is a character whose death I'd been hoping for since he shoved Bran out a window back at the beginning of Book I, so it's a high compliment to Martin's writing that I actually started to respect if not like the character in this book.  I wasn't expecting a redemption story from someone capable of such evil actions, but somehow Martin pulls it off.  And despite having far less \\"screen\\" time than in previous books, Tryrion doesn't disappoint.  His lifelong struggle for his father's respect comes to a head in this book, and their final scene is cathartic, darkly comic and well-earned.<br /><br />The only downside to this book is the knowledge that most of the characters in it won't have their stories continued until Martin FINALLY publishes \\"A Dance With Dragons,\\" the fifth book in the series, which is now in its fifth year of publication delay.  When I met Martin earlier this year at a book signing, he made it clear that there is no publication date on the horizon, so who knows how long the wait will go on?  I decided against reading the fourth book until the fifth book is out, because half a story doesn't interest me much, and after the fifth book is released and I've read it, all I'm going to want to know after that is when is the sixth book coming?  And then the seventh?  Unfortunately, Martin's talent as a writer engenders impatience in his readers, because you simply never want the story to end.  But for the time being, I'm afraid that this IS the end of my time in the Seven Kingdoms and beyond.  I'll re-read and return once there's a conclusion.their stories continued until Martin FINALLY publishes \\"A Dance With Dragons,\\" the fifth book in the series, which is now in its fifth year of publication delay.

6305127697|2.0|Viewed: 5/05<br />Rate: 3<br /><br />5/05: Primal Fear is simply not believable. It spins a yarn with many weak threads, finally arriving at a lame The Usual Suspects ending. A few of these threads moreover lead to dead ends. Take for Pinero's Hispanic friend who agreed to testify in court. Never saw him again. Take Pinero's role in this film. What was it so important about him? To introduce the subplot of investment deal? Didn't do much for the story. A scene between Gere and Linney in a bar after the drop off of a videotape in front of Linney's doorstep reached a dead end and wasted some screen time. I am so intrigued about one thing. Although Roy/Aaron personality exists, what happened to the verification of the MRI/EKG/CAT scans? Wow, I could go on with many blunders of Primal Fear. Logically, the picture splits apart like a bad melon. The casting of a few players was poor. John Mahoney doesn't work as Shaughnessy. Andre Baugher, how horrible was he, played the black assistant of Martin Vail (Gere), and that was the worst acting I've seen in this silly film. Come on, Don Cheadle or Adrian Lester can do better than him for the role. Edward Norton is a joke. In a conclusion, Primal Fear is an awful picture with very superficial acting, many holes, endless logic faults, and a silly story that begs too hard to work. It is a rip-off from A Few Good Men, The Usual Suspects, and Law And Order shows. Nobody in the film looks like a lawyer, a cop, a judge, a reporter, a criminal, or anything else imaginable. Richard Gere, gee whiz. Call it \\"Bad Acting 101.\\" Ditto for Laura Linney. Something else that ticked me off was the over-blinking and over-looking-down-to-the-floor done by many characters in this film. That tells me that nobody can act right in this picture.

B003E48AYC|4.0|The CG in this movie is amazing. My boyfriend absolutely loved this movie for it's querkiness.. The movie itself is somewhat of a \\"trip\\". Johnny Depp's character was somewhat like his character in Charlie & the Chocolate Factory. The plot had an interesting take on the story, much unlike the other cartoon version. My boyfriend loved it and loved the BluRay version.

I was not jumping to buy the 3 boxes, again, on BLU-RAY ... until I discovered that ... the discs contain not only the digitalized, but also the NOT digitalized versions of every episode ... I wanted to buy the 3 DVD boxes, older editions, to complete my collection ... which is not nessecary now I bought STAR TREK TOS on BLU-RAY ...

030745455X|5.0|How a book makes you feel is how it should be judged. I just finished The Girl Who played With Fire and am so charged up that I had to write a review with all this energy I have. Wow!!! It was a little slow at first maybe because there were so many characters in the book I started to lose tract. But by half way through the book I understood that this is no longer like any other story I ever heard or read. It was a modern murder mystery for a new age but with good old suspense and a cast of unusual characters . Bottom line: heroine is prime suspect. The mystery is solved backwards from there. The person who rejects friends in the end finds her true friend and love. If you want a edge of the seat story get this one.
B002JVWQSW|5.0|What I Can Tell You:<br /><br />This is by far, one of the best shows on TV. It is done very well for a family comedy.<br /><br />We have Jay (Ed O'Neill) and his stunning, much younger wife Gloria (Sof&iacute;a Vergara)who has a son named Manny. I was a big Married with Children fan and love Ed O'Neill so I was excited to watch. Sofia is so smoking hot, she could turn woman gay and Manny is like a little old soul.<br /><br />Claire(Julie Bowen) is Jay's daughter and she is married to Phil(Ty Burrell). They have 3 children and the dynamics of this household cracks me up. Phil really thinks he is intuned with everyone, cool dad, understanding husband but he is adorably clueless.<br /><br />The next household is Mitchell (Jesse Tyler Ferguson), Jay's son who lives with his partner Cameron(Eric Stonestreet) and their adopted Vietnamese baby, Lily. This couple is too funny.<br /><br />Why This Show Works: The writers are witty. The actors deliver perfectly and there is nothing like this on TV. I love how the actors turn to the camera and give face! I love the couch sessions peppered through the episodes and I love how diverse the show is. Hysterically funny and they touch on all topics.<br /><br />This is the kind of show you will watch in re-run and on DVD. This is the kind of show you will discuss episodes in detail with your friends and family.<br /><br />In my opinion, one of the best shows on TV

0307346617|3.0|The \\"Z\\" in this book's title, of course, stands for \\"Zombies\\". Max Brooks' \\"oral history\\" imagines a very near future when a virus has the ability to reanimate the dead. The virus creates your typical movie zombie...slow-walking, continually degrading, moaning, former-human who can only be stopped by eliminating their brain function. No, it's not as easy as a decapitation, because the mouth will continue chomping, despite its body's incapacitation.    The novel approaches the story of World War Z from the perspective of a journalist traveling the world and uncovering the histories of the war from very individual viewpoints. The result in an intriguing mix of short stories that provide a very realistic view of what might happen with such a world-wide pandemic.    The stories are neither scary nor particularly gory. Or maybe I just became immune to the gore as the tales progressed. There is no specific overarching narrative, but the individual stories are woven together by the bigger picture view of the war as a whole. Stories are divided up into several categories including pre-war, the start of the war, a significant momentum swing in the battle, and post war.    Brooks delves into the strategic complexities of battling an army that needs no supplies nor has any leaders. He introduces the logistical necessities of battling opponents that sometimes have seemingly insurmountable numbers. His stories take place all over the world, as well as above and underneath it. Brooks weaves in very tactical concerns while fleshing out very human stories, and it's this combination which I found particularly appealing.    Brooks attempts a few surprise endings in his stories, but most were not particularly surprising. He does, however, quite effectively alter the tone and tenor of his writing with each new voice he adds.    The book is fun and diverting, and I can completely understand its broad appeal.
B003PIUC02|5.0|Excellent series. Kind of a cross between 300 and Gladiator, but more graphic and more blood if you can believe that.
B003DT19F0|5.0|We bought this for our 2 year old daughter! She loves the other two Tinkerbell movies.  She didn't know it was coming so once we got out to the mail box she was thrilled!  We of course opened it and watched it right away.  It was very cute the story was touching and it had plenty of action.  I enjoyed how you really got to see the other faries personalities not just Tinkerbell.  I got quite a few laughs out of it as did my husband.  It really is a great movie and we're already looking forward to the other one coming out Fall 2012.
044654759X|5.0|This newest book by Nicholas Sparks was one of his best.  I also couldn't put it down.  I didn't want it to end.  I loved that the main character even though she had to go through pain and suffering at the hand's of her abusive husband found real love afterall.  Mr. Sparks doesn't write his books fast enough for me.  I read this one in less than two days.  Can't wait for the next one.
B003TML0VO|3.0|Carlos has been my favorite guitarist ever since Abraxas came out (ooops... dating myself), but I feel in recent years with all the \\"collaborations,\\" I feel that he's lost the edge in the studio ( he is still phenomenal live).  I've tried to stay with him through Supernatural and Shaman, thinking he was looking for a new direction and was trying to find his \\"voice\\".  Unfortunately, doing an album of covers is about as far afield from finding a new direction as I can imagine.  There are about 3 songs on here which radiate any heat - the rest come across as cold and soulless.  I also wonder if Santana and the guest musicians even played in the same studio at the same time.  There is a very detached sound to this CD overall.  For someone with so much talent, Carlos seems to be squandering it here.  Here's hoping for a return to form on his next outing.

0765326353|5.0|Brandon Sanderson has done it again!  The way of kings is destined to be one of the greatest fantasy series of all time.  I know everybody says that, but it's true!  He has proven his greatness with the concluding Robert Jordan trilogy, and his own Mistborn series masterpiece.  The Way of Kings has everything that made his previous works so great.  The characters get deeper and deeper as the story unfolds, and the secrets in their past are absolutely astonishing.  The world in which his story is told is in its own way a living character, its consciousness is apparent in every chapter.  The 'magic' (for lack of a better word) is unique and well thought out.  On every level, the way of kings will capture your mind, and your heart, and leave you desperate for more.  As for myself, I can't wait to read it again and again.  I will anxiously await for the next installment of The Stormlight Archive!

0439023513|3.0|The third part of Suzanne Collins \\"Hunger Games\\" trilogy.  Although I enjoyed the story it didn't flow as well as the first two books:  Hunger Games and Catching Fire.  It took me 100 pages or so to \\"get into\\" this story in part because of the change in the some characters particularly Katniss - whom the book revolves around.  Ultimately the seeming change in the story line and characters does make sense.  I would recommend the book if you have read the first two.    I am glad to hear that some high school English classes in our area are using this series with their students as I think there are many  ideas worthy of discussion in the trilogy and the author's writing style should appeal to teens.

0345505387|2.0|The Exile is a beautifully rendered Graphic Novel, but that is all it is. Frankly, unless you are a fan of the Outlander series, you will feel bewildered and utterly lost at the turn of the last page.<br />In my personal opinion, this book was nothing more than a gesture to cash in on the momentum that Jamie and Claire have developed over the last 2 decades. It's a \\"not-so\\" new take on the story, regardless of what Mrs. Gabaldon will have you believe.<br />It leaves a lot to be desired... like, the last two thirds of the book. Of course, it goes without saying that this may be a blessing in disguise, I think we can all agree that we could do without SEEING the shenanigans that go on with Black Jack Randall and Jamie on the last pages of the book.<br /><br />I realize that not ALL of the book can be transposed onto a comic, because the story is too broad for such a thing, but this makes the story that all Outlander fans fell in love with, seem trite and nothing but a frivolous romance that seems to appear out of thin air, at least in The Exile.<br /><br />It's lack luster at best, and I wish I could return it. But alas, I feel attached t o these characters, so it'll take its place next to \\"Echo in the Bone.\\"<br /><br />Lastly, and this is of course MY fault for having picked up the book in the first place, but I feel like I cannot picture Jamie and Claire, and EVEN Murtagh I initially did, now that I have these \\"cartoon\\" characters imbedded into my brain. I'm only on the fourth book of the series, so with luck, the figures that have been with me all along will eventually return to me.
B0002XMF62|4.0|In 1987 no one knew what was going on with Black Sabbath. Tony Iommi was determined to re-start the band regardless of the criticism he endured from everyone in the industry, including his former band mates. This album came out on the heels of Seventh Star; an album that was unfortunately given the Sabbath name with the additional language \\"featuring Tony Iommi.\\" That was a bad move. Call it Sabbath or call it the Iommi Band, but don't qualify it. It took away from a very good record that featured Glenn Hughes on vocals.    Enter Ray Gillen. He recorded all of the tracks for Eternal Idol, then left to form Badlands. Enter Tony Martin; an unknown British vocalist who recorded over the Gillen tracks and subsequently remained with Sabbath and Iommi for four more studio LPs.     Song for song the album stands up not only to a lot of what was out at the time, but remains a hard hitting, well recorded, and relevant album. Bob Daisley contributed a great deal to the record and Eric Singer is a standout on drums. The sound is bold and big and Iommi's riffs are thunderous. No doubt it's more mainstream than previous albums, like Born Again, but if you take it in context with the time period you can really appreciate it, especially with the pressure of lineup changes and bad publicity that plagued the band at the time.    Look out for a remastered version of the album with a bonus disc of the original recording by Ray Gillen. It will be released at the end of October and available as an import here in the U.S.. Seventh Star will be given the same treatment, and word is that Born Again will be re-released in 2011.

B002VECLVO|5.0|I have always enjoyed the company of gay men as they offer the freedom to flirt, to be outrageous and enjoyed, free from the heterosexual consequences of potential rape or misinterpreted friendliness, at least for a woman!    The film, 'A Single Man' is a work or art, every scene exquisite in its completeness of form, content and style. And style is important as a reflection of sexual mores and offers us, as viewers, a window of opportunity to observe and experience something that a 'straight' sexual identity audience has not experienced as a screen presence in mainstream media. A fresh sensibilty.    For some individuals, sexual preference remains as a constant throughout life - for others it is a state of flux, determined by the attributes, attraction and love of an individual. Nothing is certain other than the love one feels for another human being and the grief one feels at their passing.    In this film, being gay is synonomous with childlessness and the inevitable career paths that eventuate from such a position. The quality of a male gay relationship is measured against the inequality of a heterosexual marriage next door, which in typical sixties fashion, evolves around the dominant male breadwinner and a female homemaker with two obnoxious children.     I love this film, every scene accentuates a gay asthetic where beauty and emotional generosity is celebrated - just see it.    Kaye Separovic  Australia
044654759X|5.0|I am an avid Nicholas Sparks reader and I loved this book as much as any of his previous novels.  This was a love story with a twist of danger.  I thought the element of danger really added to this story and it was nice for a change considering he typically doesn't use danger in his novels.  I think this will be an excellent movie when it comes out and I'll be there right away to see it on the big screen.  The way this novel ended, I think leaves it open to a sequel and I would be very interested in seeing how that would turn out.  Good work as always!
B003L77TZI|5.0|Much money was used getting it into our radar; and it's very well written and well presented.    But you know what? There really are about 4,000 new releases that better deserve every Grammy this one is sure to take, as well as over 10,000 new releases that SHOULD get nominations and perhaps lose to Katy or someone else.    Instead we'll get about 200 nominations and perhaps 40 wins and we'll keep up this impression that there really are only about 50 people making any kind of music that we should like and most of them wear almost no clothing.    [ In fair disclosure I have to say I'm very active with the annual Native American Music Awards and that this is not a personal attack on the GRAMMYS OR Katy Perry. Mostly about our industry itself. I really do enjoy this rekkid. :) ]
B003R0LBVW|5.0|I loved this book ! Needless to say, it will soon be considered an American modern classic, I'm sure. After having read the enthusiastic article on Time magazine before the book was published, I understood this wasn't just some silly novel to pass time. Jonathan Franzen mixes unpretentious writing with an immaculate story that kept me glued to my kindle and away from my homework.  Although a good chunk of the book is introductory in nature, I never once felt bored while tracing the steps of Walter, Patty, Joey and all the other impressively complete characters in the novel. I didn't know what I thought of the book until the very last page - suddenly I shivered and my eyes got ready for some old-fashioned tears. Even a couple days later, I feel awfully sad that my time on Nameless Lake is over - but I can't wait to go back. I rarely reread, but, in this case, I have no choice.

Yes, I did pre-order this graphic novel, and yes, I am a fan of the Outlander series.<br /><br />I prompt you, however, not to read the bad reviews (despite the fact that there are many) until you read this review.<br /><br />As someone who has a great appreciation of literature and art as well, I own a vast array of novels and graphic novels. I won't consider myself an expert by any means, but I think I have a decent working knowledge of where the two differ. I agree with most reviewers that this might be blasphemy for hardcore Gabaldon fans. I am not a hardcore fan, and I decided to take Diana's endeavor with a grain of salt. She was certainly trying something new and regardless of what it was, fans were going to buy it (and they still will, more than likely).<br /><br />To be honest, most of what I loved as a reader about Outlander got lost in the translation from novel to graphic novel. Unlike some, however, I feel that this was not because of the artist, but because of Diana Gabaldon's writing style: she writes in first person. It makes it a little difficult to translate that to graphic form, especially when you are taking it from someone that is outside of the relationship that is the core of her series. I felt that this was the main problem. Had the story been told from Jamie's point of view and not Murtagh's...well, I'm not saying that would have made it leaps and bounds better, but it might have helped a little.<br /><br />That being said, I enjoyed the graphic novel a lot. It was light, not too heavy, did have a lot of nudity, which knowing the Gabaldon, should come as no surprise to readers. I thought the art was gorgeous; the illustrator really did a great job. I personally enjoyed the rough edge that the pictures had to them. It was not clean or polished with hard lines. It was light, airy and it went really well with the story. The art was the best part for me personally.<br /><br />Do I think this was a waste of time? No. I spent a good two hours blowing through it on Tuesday night when I could have been writing a paper and I think it was worth it. I enjoyed myself and it was fun. Not earth shattering, but just fun. I think that this will be fun for you as a fan and as a reader if you allow it to be. I suggest you try not to get caught up in what your expectations of Gabaldon are, because she is not going to live up to them with this graphic novel. This is not her new 800-page novel. This is a 200-300 page graphic novel with no sweeping hills or grand descriptions of scenery or anything else.<br />Take it for what it actually is and not what you were wanting it to be. You will be a lot happier with the results if you just let it happen and try to have fun with it.<br /><br />Would I recommend this? Sure! I already have. My mother and my older sister, and probably my aunt will all read it while on vacation in Key West. I told them it would be great to read for the plane or while sitting in the airport.<br /><br />I hope that is review helps you make the decision whether or not to purchase. I think if you are looking for a Gabaldon novel, stay away from this. You will probably be disappointed and displeased with the artist's depictions of Jamie and Claire. If you want a fun, light, easy read that give you some insight to the other characters, then buy it. Like I said, not great, but I am happy that my money went to something I enjoyed and that others will enjoy as well.<br /><br />I hope, I'll repost and let you know if everyone in my family hated it (I doubt they will).<br /><br />UPDATE:<br /><br />I'm surprised to be the top review! My older sister read this, and she, like many of you, weren't fans! She said that she put it down halfway through. I still have the book on my shelf and enjoy it from time to time.?

B000ZECQ08|3.0|I've seen every Harry Potter film so far released and have been underwhelmed by all of them. I've never really been interested by the somewhat flimsy plots nor engaged by the characters. There's something parochial about them, partly because so much of each movie is set in or around Hogwarts. In fairness, however, none of these limitations are likely to bother the target audience. Half Blood Prince is yet again set mostly in the school for the magically gifted but this time the story manages, to some extent, to surpass what has gone before. The plot is fuller than in the previous episodes, and the familiar characters are growing up, thus giving scope for them be fleshed out -- suddenly they're much more interesting to us older viewers. The acting has also improved over the years -- even Daniel Radcliffe has lost most of his woodenness. All in all this is the best of the Potter films so far, despite suffering from some of the failings of the others.
B00009XITQ|5.0|love the young comedies and the chance to see the up and comers.  Good family movie
B003JTHESA|5.0|This is the best Maiden album since Brave New World and definitely better than Dance of Death and Matter of Life and Death. I know some of the old fans want Maiden to remake Piece of Mind over and over again but it's just not going to happen. What I love so much about Brave New World is all over this album too, and it quickly became one of my favorites. I was never one for the singles on Maiden albums, although they can kick ass too, I usually go for the long songs like Seventh Son of a Seventh Son or the Nomad. Listen to it with your eyes closed or while reading the lyrics and I bet it'll become something you will enjoy too, use an open mind and perhaps hang up the leather jacket from 1983.    My top picks:    The Talisman  Starblind  Coming home  The Alchemist
B00005U11Z|3.0|had to buy this so I could critique the \\"new Steve\\"  there will never by another Steve Perry no matter how many times they try.
030758660X|5.0|I can't tell you how much I love this book.  I've loved vampires since watching Dark Shadows when I was growing up, all the way through Lestat and now Twilight.  So, this book was a must for me.  I knew that I'd love it because it had to do with two of my favorite things, vampires and knitting, but I didn't expect it to be as nice as it is.  And not just the photography - beautiful photography is common in knitting books.  Where this book stands out is this - the patterns are all on pages that are kind of yellowed and old looking with a gothic font, there are little \\"tid-bites\\" of vampire information on just about every page, there are two vampire quizzes, and there is even a page of tips on getting blood out of our knitting!  That sounds kind of funny, but it's really very practical!  Each chapter has kind of a theme and there is a little paragraph at the beginning of each one.  The author's writing is really good - informative and yet with a sense of humor.  I thought I knew quite a bit about vampires, but I learned a lot from this book that I didn't know.    As for the patterns, they are really nice.  They are mostly accessories, which are my favorite thing to knit anyway.  There are socks, scarves, capes, bags, hats, etc.  A lot of them have kind of a gothic feel to them, but not so much that anyone couldn't wear most of them.  There are a few with vampire sayings on them, but if you wanted to make them without the sayings or change them, that would be easy to do.      I wouldn't think twice about buying this book.  I buy knitting books all the time and this is one of the most unique books I have and I highly recommend it.
B000068CNX|4.0|every season is full of laughs  you see something new and funny every time you watch
0345505387|4.0|Obviously most of the lower scoring reviewers do not know how time consuming art is.  It appears that most people were expecting a new novel and this mostly was not although there were some new elements to it.  My main disappointment is that it really does not get farther into how Jamie came to love Claire so quickly and passionately.  That's what I was looking for and only got hints at it.  Murtagh's depth was a surprise as was Dougal's ferocity.  We all knew what a schemer he was but not really how hateful he was.  I would have liked to have seen his kiss with Claire and what his thoughts were.    Anyway, this was very worthwhile as long as you weren't going into it expecting the secrets of the universe.
B003ASLJS6|2.0|purchased for my spouse.  not my cup of tea but he was very pleased
B003TML0VO|1.0|As many others have already stated, this is a very disappointing cd.  I'm suffering big time on Buyer's remorse.  I've purchased every cd available from Santana and imports, even hung out with Raul Rekow & Karl Perrazo (percussion section) back in 2001 @ Harrah's in St.Louis. This is a very disappointing cd.  I listened to it once and it's probably the last time that cd will see light.      It's LONG OVERDUE for an ACTUAL SANTANA ALBUM with original material!!!   I also miss the organ/keyboard work from Chester Thompson as Santana has a new keyboardist in 2010 which fails to impress.    Save your money!!! Don't buy this one.

0786955554|3.0|First the good news. Dungeon Tiles Master Set - The Dungeon is nicely packaged. It comes in a box covered in dungeon tile graphics. It also reprints many tiles from out-of-print tile sets. With this one product, you should be able to create a variety of dungeons. The cardboard stock is good and the tiles can be easily separated.     Now onto the bad news. This tile set contains only 10 sheets. The box is large enough for twice that many sheets, so it has a cardboard insert. It's always disappointing when you open a package and half of it is empty space. Most of the tiles are reprints from previous sets. There are some new tiles, and some of the front/back combinations have changed, but the vast majority of tiles are reprints. More new tiles would have been nice for this new release. The graphics on the box is boring. It's the basic gray dungeon square over and over. And actual dungeon would have been cool. Somewhere a mention of this being Dungeon Tiles would have been nice. The box is of such a size that once you punch out the tiles, you cannot lay down the tiles without having gaps. If the box was just a little bit longer, you could have laid down enough tiles to fill the inside dimension. Why do I mention this? Without filling the box, tiles will move around and get banged around. I used previous sets to fill the box. You can stand on end the 2x2 and 2x4 tiles to fill the end gap. The lack of attention to detail is what I find disappointing.     So overall, I would only recommend this set to new DMs. If you have previous sets, skip this purchase.
B000JMLFLW|5.0|I absolutely adored the movie Pride & Prejudice with Keira Knightley. I then thought it would be fun to read the original novel on my new Kindle.  Even though it took me three days to read it I was not dissapointed. I had the movie running in my mind the entire time I was reading so I was able to compare the movie with the novel. I must say it enhanced the experience. I so loved each time Elizabeth and Mr. Darcy communicated in any way. Just reading their conversations was such a delight. The book really filled in all the conversations that didn't make it into the movie.<br /><br />This story reveals how it is possible to go from hating someone to loving them completely. The journey Elizabeth must go through to love Mr. Darcy is fascinating and complex. There are many letters exchanged and gossip Elizabeth must sort through to find the truth. The reader really feels the hatred she feels and then feels the warming of the heart as each page goes by. Truly this is one of the best romance novels ever written. I'd recommend you watch the movie first and then you will have something to compare this to. Here is the link to the movie: [[ASIN:B000E1ZBGS Pride & Prejudice]]<br /><br />The Rebecca Review
B000TGJ8AS|5.0|I really feel that in the forth season of NCIS, the team began to hit their stride because they'd had a year or so to gel as a dramatic unit with the addition of Ziva and the departure of Kate Todd after season two and the directors chair there got some brief stability with the addition of Lauren Holly as director Jenny Sheppard an often adversarial foil for Gibbs, perfected better in later years by Rocky Carroll. This is the season when favorite characters became more human to the audience unlike some police procedurals' where everyone is either a man of steel type incapable of emotion or a walled off gun touting bad ass chick who only talks through the trail of blood they leave on the floor. For example, Tony while on special assignment for Dir. Sheppard falls in love with the daughter of notorious arms dealer La Gran Wie conflicting his duty to the agency with his personal life...a real departure for playboy Tony. Tim Magee quits NCIS after his sister is accused in the murder of Navy sailor indicating that although he loves the agency something is more important than his job, which we may not have known before. Even tough as nails former Moussad assassin Ziva David displays her human side when she falls for a young man condemned to die after being poisoned. Without these character building moments that show genuine weakness alongside the tough bravado, NCIS would not be the success it is today.
B0026OR2PE|5.0|Where do I start?<br /><br />This would have to be the best book I have read in recent times.  Seriously good!  I started this book on Monday and finished it today (Thursday).  For me that's seriously quick, I couldn't put the thing down.  I was hooked, engaged and excited by what I read, but what's it all about you ask?<br /><br />Obviously innovation, but Scott Berkun delves much deeper, discussing what innovation really is - this was seriously interesting.  Without giving to much away, he suggests it's a term we probably use too much (you know one of those buzzwords we throw around - sounds good but do we really innovate).<br /><br />Secondly, the book is about believing in yourself and how to stimulate your thinking to come up with ideas, which may one day provide a solution to a problem that makes you money.  Scott Berkun covers everything from idea generation, including environments which are likely to foster such ideas, to pitching ideas to your boss and venture capitalists, to maintaining your motivation, to understanding how culture and mindsets can thwart even the very best ideas and everything else in between.  He provides tools, examples and much more  to help you do/overcome all of this.<br /><br />I found this book easy to read and  well referenced, which gave it credibility.  Scott Berkun does a brilliant job of revealing just how many of the world's greatest innovations (Internet & others) and most successful companies (Google, Apple & others) made it where they have.  He cites hard work and determination amongst other things as being responsible for helping them to where they are.  He believes though we are all capable of such great feats and provides a great deal of insight, giving I'm sure any reader a boost in confidence.<br /><br />Of most interest was the real stories behind how it all started for these individuals and companies.  Scott suggests it all starts with an IDEA.  That's it, a simple idea but for it to be realised and potentially one day be successful, you must do something about it and make that idea happen.  He suggests no idea happens if all you do is think about it.  You must do something about it.<br /><br />I found knowing the real stories behind these companies very refreshing, rather than the version often cited in mainstream media.<br /><br />Whether you're in business, want to be in business, have an idea or have a dream you wish to realise, then this book might just be for you.  I know Scott has certainly re-ignited my desire to stop talking and start doing.thing about it and make that idea happen.  He suggests no idea happens if all you do is think about it.  You must do something about it.         I found knowing the real stories behind these companies very refreshing, rather than the version often cited in mainstream media.

I know Scott has certainly re-ignited my desire to stop talking and start doing.
B000002A9Z|5.0|Good Afternoon, this is an amazing collection of three great players and in my opinion the best Mr. Bloomfield. Let's also not forget the contributions of Al Kooper and Steven Stills. An amazing recording and looking to purchase others through this label. Thank you for having this iconic release available in this format.      Michael A. Contini
B002ZG98C8|4.0|If you're a fan of the over-the-top grindhouse tributes to the 70's style drive in action flicks, you're in for a treat.<br /><br />Danny Trejo plays Machete, a former Mexican federal agent turned rogue vigilante who specializes in womanizing, destruction and of course, killing.  The plot really isn't important in this style of big screen action, but in case you're wondering, vengeance is the key theme.<br /><br />One reason this yarn makes a lasting impression is the stellar cast.  Along with Trejo, you get Don Johnson as a red neck cop, Michelle Rodgriguez as the head of an underground vigilante group, Jeff Fahey as a crooked aide to a dubious government official, Jessica Alba as a hard edged agent with a soft side, Lindsay Lohan as a bad ass drug smoking daughter (what a stretch huh?) and Cheech Marin as a killer turned priest turned killer again.  Then throw in the added bonuses of Robert De Niro as a sleazy politician and Steven Seagal as the evil sword toting kingpin slash drug lord, and you've got the makings of cake with a whole lot of icing.<br /><br />Furthermore, with Robert Rodriguez at the helm, you know you're in for a whole lotta out of this world action, ultra clever dialog, and sizzling hotties around every corner.<br /><br />If you've seen the trailer, you know what the film claims it will deliver; and if you've seen the movie, you know it keeps the promise.
0439023513|4.0|I think the main problem with the ending of the book is that SC brought it back to love. In a whole the books aren't really about love. They are about rebellion, war, peace, and the pain these events cause. Overall its a political series that's meant to make people think about their society and the world we live in and how these books could possibly mirror our own reality one day. But at the end of the series instead of focusing on the revolution and then the rebuilding of Panem and the peace that follows it centers in on Katniss and her overall choice for a lifetime companion. Don't get me wrong I did enjoy the little love triangle aspect of the series and I did pick a side (TEAM GALE!!!!) but I just thought that ending it with the love being the focal point kind of ruined the whole overall point of the trilogy. And the main problem is that she didn't resolve the love triangle in a fashion that appeases the readers.     Heres how I see it: If Katniss had never been thrust into the hunger games with Peeta SHE WOULD have ended up with Gale. Ultimately her and Gale were kind of \\"meant to be\\". But that was before the hunger games and the rebellion. Those events changed everything. Gale and Katniss changed and they were no longer who they were before and by the end of the story its true: Katniss doesn't need Gale with his fiery personality, she needs Peeta, the optimist, the one who can give her hope for the future.     So if its not who Katniss ends up with that is the problem what is? Its how SC resolved the Katniss/Gale relationship. Meaning she didn't resolve it AT ALL. Sure it was obvious that Katniss and Gale had been growing apart all through Mockingjay. They didn't see eye to eye on rebellion issues and then the bombing resulting in Prims death was the last straw. Their relationship collapsed under the pain and wounding that could never be fully understood or healed. But you could tell that even to the end Gale loved Katniss. He still cared for her and wanted what was best for her. And you could also tell that he knew deep down inside that Peeta was what was best for her. And that should have been expressed. Instead of their silly little falling out, where Gale just walks away never to return they needed to have a heart to heart conversation. Gale needed to tell her how he felt, how sorry he was that Prim died, how much he loved her, and that the one person that she really needed to make her whole was Peeta, not himself. Throughout the series we are told that Gale knows Katniss better than anyone else, he knows what shes thinking and feeling often even before she knows herself. I feel that SC should have written that Gale was the one who opened her eyes to the fact that Peeta was the one for her. Give her no regrets when she chooses Peeta. Assure her that her happiness will make him happy too. And then for the last time, kiss her goodbye. That would have resolved their relationship SO MUCH BETTER. It would have made so much sense and then Team Gale people wouldn't feel so cheated (I mean come on all we know is he has a job in District 2 whats up with that???).     I mean SC decided to end the whole trilogy centering around love. Because she made that decision she needed to not only resolve Peeta and Katniss' love story, but Gale and Katniss' love story as well.
B000025XKM|5.0|When one listens to Nick Drakes swan song \\"Pink Moon\\" one  first notices the barrenness of the sounds being produced, only the sound of his hauntingly breathy (almost ghostly) voice, and his at first seemingly simple guitar work. The word \\"Cognitive Dissonance\\" comes to mind when thinking of this album. Dissonant because it toys with your heartstrings. While I listen to it, the sadness and malaise in his voice is palpable. But at the same time, the melodies are played at such a speed that it almost feels like a feeling of relaxation. when I hear the final track, I think of happiness and good things, enjoying nature, and other pleasant thoughts.     Aside from the voice, the guitar work is quite virtuoso in execution (not in the traditional sense of fast soloing and precision etc.) but the way he makes his guitar sound like two guitars at once, makes me think he recorded a second guitar part over the first part.     So in conclusion, this is a great album, not only because the music is pleasant, but also because of the emotions elicited by it.
B000LAZDQA|5.0|As a huge fan of Hedwig and the Angry Inch and John Cameron Mitchell, when I saw this movie I immediately had to have it. I had never seen it or even heard about it before but had a feeling that the risk was worth it. I watched \\"Shortbus\\" and was blown away. I felt every emotion watching this movie. I laughed, I cried, I wanted to scream....it was everything I could ever want in a movie. Deeply moving and entertaining. Be prepared, there is a lot of sex in this movie but it's artistic rather than pornographic. It's very beautiful. Where is Shortbus?? I want to go!
B000NA28I4|2.0|** SPOILERS ahead, in case you can't predict the whole movie anyway **<br /><br />Another entry in my neverending quest to watch every last fantasy and science fiction film ever, no matter how bad,  ERAGON - based on the supposedly awful first novel by the then-teenage Christopher Paolini - is surprisingly enough not nearly as terrible as I expected it to be.  It kept me awake at least, and only had one or two actually cringe-inducing moments; I suspect that, as much as I'm bored with generic stuff like this, I'm also more able to tolerate some of it simply because I like the Tolkien-influenced genre tropes to begin with; those who don't have patience for stuff like farmboys-becoming-chosen-heroes for no reason whatsoever other than that's what the story says will probably be less generous than I am, and perhaps be annoyed that they've seen it all before even if they haven't seen it nearly as many times as I have. There's something to be said for being a genre specialist I suppose.<br /><br />But generic this story is, unfortunately, and ultimately its greatest sin is dullness and predictability. Let's see how few words it takes to sum it up: years ago there were dragons and dragonriders that protected the land of Alagaësia, until one day one of them went all bad and decided to kill all of his buddies and take power over the land for himself. His name was John Malkovich, oops I mean Galbatorix (Paolini's strength, if he has one, is not in naming). But one egg somehow got saved (this is never explained) and eventually a young woman guarding it, Arya (Sienna Guillory) saves it from the king's evil magician Durza (Robert Carlyle) by sending it to Eragon (Ed Speleers) a young farmboy. The king soon realizes what's up and sends people to kill the kid, but not before the dragon hatches. Soon the town is aflame and Eragon has to escape with his dragon Saphira (voiced by Rachel Weisz) - which grows to adulthood instantly in one of those \\"magic\\" moments. They're helped out by an older, wise man named Obi-Wan Kenobi, sorry I mean Brom (Jeremy Irons, who also narrates the opening few minutes) who knows - well, you'll figure it out. They have to get to the Vardens, the people who resist the king, but Eragon gets a psychic message from the imprisoned Arya and decides to go save her; Brom of course counsels against this but Eragon being headstrong goes ahead, penetrates the Death Star and saves Princess Leia with the help of the brash young Han Solo, but not before Brom sacrifices himself in the fight against Darth Vader...oops, there I did it again. Well, you get the idea. And at the end there's a spectacular battle as the dragon has learned to breathe fire and Eragon gets to avenge Brom, yadda yadda yadda.<br /><br />What saves this from being really horrible is the acting of Irons and Weisz, who really put a lot of heart and seriousness into this silly stuff, some nice photography that actually has a decent range of light and color palettes compared to the typical modern action film (courtesy of DP Hugh Jackson), and relatively competent and brisk direction on the part of first-time feature director Fangmeier. Yes, the 104 minutes gloss over an awful lot of stuff that must have been developed better (well one hopes so) in the book, but this being so utterly lacking in originality only the stupidest or youngest and least experienced of viewers are going to really have trouble knowing what's going on or filling in the blanks. Even really idiotic scenes like Irons' reappearance in the magician's stronghold just in time to save Eragon by taking a spear for him can probably be explained through \\"magic\\" which we gradually learn lets dragonriders do just about anything. How convenient.<br /><br />So I wouldn't really recommend this to anyone, but if you're in the mood for completely undemanding, mindless fantasy there's plenty out there that is much worse, and I'm happy to give it two stars; in a really generous mood it could even push for a third.

B003E8AF5U|4.0|Despite some searing reviews and an eclectic mix of tracks, I'm enjoying Congratulations. There are some tracks I like quite a lot, and some I like less. If you like Oracular, this is still a worthy purchase. Just don't expect the consistent tone that record offers. I could pass on the rock oriented tracks like Don Treacy and Brian Eno, but then some folks like those most. I think they are fine tracks, and yeah, I think Eno is god, but I get a little bored with that track.    I've heard some bad feedback about the live show, but I don't listen to music because I'm a concert blowhard. I don't care if they're incompetent Milli Vanillis. I think the music is awesome.    If you are like me and thought Oracular was fantastic, this is a fine follow-up, just don't expect that record all over again. And I'm looking forward to the next release.
B001E2JNA6|1.0|If Amazon people are reading this, I wish they only put the Blu-ray version reviews here. Why does Amazon always carry the DVD reviews to the Blu-ray version? I am sure most people already knew that this is a fantastic adaption, and they just want to know what's on the Blu-ray version.    The same thing for other Blu-ray releases too. Amszon, only Blu-ray reviews for the Blu-ray version please. Because I don't care how the DVD version is. I am sure all the other poeple who try to check out the Blu-ray version feel the same.
0786955554|4.0|This new compilation of tiles offers many items, which should find regular use in your gaming sessions.  Most generic tiles in this set offer few specific details, which is nice since they don't take away from your descriptions.<br /><br />I like the idea of the packaging these tiles in the included reusable box.  Prior tile sets offer no storage for the included tiles once they are popped out of the package.  This box is sized to just slightly larger than the raw unpunched tile sheets.  There should be room to add in tiles from other sets with out issue.  The designers of the box included a generic tile pattern on the entire outside of the box, which can be used as a raised platform area.<br /><br />I've purchased several of these and looked forward to including them into my game sessions.

All family friendly except Rocky 5 has some slight language, but nothing to extreme.<br /><br />Disc Quality: 3/5<br />Rocky and Rocky Balboa have professional looking menus and the disc themselves look different than the other four movies. 2,3,4,5 all look like standard blu ray discs with just the name of the movie on them and a still frame for a menu. Don't expect any commentary.<br /><br />Movie Quality: 4/5<br />If you've seen older movies put on blu ray with minimal restore then you get the idea with these. Rocky 1 looks the worse, some clipping and sometimes grainy, didn't notice too much blur on 120Hz. Rocky 2 is a little better, not as grainy. Rocky 3 looks like most 80s blu ray movies I've seen (Rambo, Commando, etc.) with some blur. Rocky 4 is exceptional, looks clear, great color and great sound and no blur. Rocky 5 is also clear and the sound is clear as well but you don't know much of a difference, if any, between this movie and 4. Rocky Balboa has some weird lighting but overall obviously it's the best looking one in the bunch.<br /><br />Extra Features: 2/5<br />Some nice Sly training videos for Balboa and some making of's but nothing like a reunion episode or documentary looking back with Sly or anything. Pretty much just thrown into the box set.<br /><br />Overall, I give this a 4/5 simply because it's Rocky and it's the top of the line right now. If you have it on DVD and is it worth it to rebuy it? My opinion would be no because nothing on these discs looks better than up converting a DVD. That being said, it is the latest and greatest format to have Rocky on and if you see Amazon selling it for a good deal pick it up, especially if you don't own any Rocky collection.you see Amazon selling it for a good deal pick it up, especially if you don't own any Rocky collection.
0061714372|5.0|An engrossing read, and one I found hard to put down.  Naturally, if you're a Mustaine/Megadeth fan, some of the information in this book will be familiar to you but there's a lot of \\"fill in the blanks\\" information you will appreciate - specifically, information about Mustaine's upbringing, some of the personnel changes within Megadeth and why they happened, and of course, the seemingly endless substance-abuse roller coaster.  You don't have to have a background in psychology to figure out that Dave's childhood contributed to they way he handled certain situations in adulthood, but I also came away with a huge appreciation for his sheer grit and determination to make something of himself.  Anger is an amazing motivator, and Dave clearly used his rage to propel him to enormous success.  He didn't have to turn out the way he did - there are many, many failed musicians and Dave could have easily been a one-hit-wonder washout.  Clearly, the talent and need to be heard was there.    I always have the same reaction when I discover just how messed up on drugs my favorite musicians were when they recorded the music I adore - a bit ripped off, and wondering just how much better the end product would have been had they not been so blitzed.  Interestingly, Dave pondered the opposite - he worried that he would not be as prolific sober!      The only thing missing from this book is an index.  It would be nice for future reference to go back and look up certain individuals or events.    Unlike some reviewers, I do not believe Dave came across as whiny or blaming others for his misfortunes, misdeeds or mistakes.  To the contrary, I think he takes full responsibility for all of the above.  The Metallica thing, well, it is what it is.  No, I don't think he deserved to be inducted into the Hall of Fame with them.  I agree with his decision not to attend the ceremony.  I would like to see Megadeth inducted.  I have separate opinions on that whole charade that have nothing to do withthe review of this book.    If you have any appreciation for Dave Mustaine and the music he created for over 25 years, you will not be disappointed with this book.
B0009RCPY8|5.0|it was an interesting movie, and since this was one of the movies that was used for my sign language class, i'd thought i would check it out....the characters were a good cast and it is just amazing ....i would definitely buy from this buyer again.     on time and quick....excellent service  =D
B0014I4KH6|4.0|I think Taylor's songs are rather high-school-esque, but at least she is in that age group so is being true to herself.  I hate when singers have songs about things they could never really know anything about.  I think she is a pretty talented song writer considering her age.  She isn't the best vocally, but most of her songs are catchy, fun, or poignant.  The only ones where her voice is just whiny and awful are \\"Should've Said No\\" and \\"Picture to Burn.\\"
159102594X|5.0|The Blade Itself, by Joe Abercrombie, was--above all else-- a fascinating and engrossing read.  Not since the Lord of The Rings have readers been introduced to such a set of utterly believable characters, each with their own way of thinking.<br /><br />As Abercrombie switches between his various points-of-view, we see each person as they perceive the world.  Jezal is a pompous yet noble snob, unaware of his own prejudices.  Logen is a lumbering giant from the North, amazed by all he sees in the cities to which they travel, but more intelligent than anyone thinks.  Even the antihero, Sand van Glotka, is admirable in his search for the truth.<br /><br />In the end, I believe it is this vibrant life that Abercrombie manages to instill in each of his characters that makes the book so very enjoyable.  When you've read through a chapter or two from Logen's point-of-view, and then you observe how the others perceive him, it fleshes the character's out so well.  In this, the author truly soars above his contemporaries who use similar techniques.<br /><br />The story through the first book gives the reader insight into a lush world, with a living history.  The action is superb, and easy to follow.  Unlike convoluted paragraphs others may employ to describe a few seconds of battle, Abercrombie is efficient in his narrative, painting the picture of fluid and brutal combat between trained warriors.<br /><br />Speaking of the narrative, the dialog between characters is often hilarious.  Abercrombie seems to have an easy way with humor, with some noteworthy laugh out loud moments, without seeming forced.<br /><br />In closing, for fantasy fans or fans of action, I implore you to dive into The Blade Itself, it is a truly different take on a somewhat familiar formula that will make you remember why you liked this stuff in the first place.
0393068382|5.0|It is exceedingly rare to find such a gem of a book. The book is academically serious, but it is written with such flair and panache -- and clarity and concision -- that you don't have to be a brainiac to understand the Fine points made within.     What Fine does in this book is 1) survey some of the best known literature concluding that there are biological or innate gender differences 2) expose very real problems in methodology and reasoning in this literature 3) and uncover some of the little-known work that does not suffer from such appalling errors which casts doubt on the claim that there are biological or innate gender differences. Fine is extremely careful about how she states her conclusions; she's no messianic fanatic who declares that there are no such innate differences. She is too smart to think that the data out there give us a firm answer either way. What she shows, brilliantly, is that those who pretend that there is such definitive evidence are guilty of a rush to judgment.     Fine is a serious academic who has done the public a great service by making clear to ordinary people how shibboleths about gender difference that permeate our culture do not have firm grounding in the neuroscientific studies on which they often draw. At the same time, she does the academy a great service; gender studies in neuroscience needs to up its game.     And while she is accomplishing all this, you, the reader, will be laughing, gasping, smirking, grinning, and just plain enjoying the fun way she presents her material. Kudos to such a young talent! This is going on my holiday gift list!
141694737X|5.0|Found this book in the gift shop at the Biose Zoo, \\"Zoo Boise\\", and gave it to my granddaughter as a keepsake. We had lots of fun reading it togeather. She loved opening the flaps. Great story, loved the ending.
B003R0LBVW|1.0|I am most of the way through the first of the three audio downloads that comprise this book. I am left wondering what else I can possibly learn about these people that I havent already heard?? I am so bored with these ridiculous people and their boring, unbelievable lives.
B000063UR1|5.0|Silent Running is one of those classic science-fiction films that has been sadly overlooked almost since it was first released in 1971.  I myself hadn't heard about it until just last week.  I'm glad I bought it, because although it's a little dated, the basic premise, acting, story, and movie are really quite intriguing. Bruce Dern plays a botanist aboard a space freighter in the earth's future.  He takes care of the last living trees.  Apparently, all the trees on earth have died because of pollution, and now everybody lives in temperature-controlled domes (always 75 degrees).  After eight years of caring for the trees, along with the cute rabbits and animals that live in the orbiting forest, he gets the order to detach the tree bio-dome and destroy it with nuclear bomb, because \\"the corporation needs to use the spaceship for more commercial shipments\\".     Dern will do anything to save the trees, including betraying his three shipmates. He escapes from his corporate masters, pretending to have technical problems that force him to go adrift (hence the title of the film \\"Silent Running\\", from the submarine ploy to escape detection).  Soon, he is all alone, except for the companionship of his three drones (we would now call them droids).      I won't give away the ending, but it's a great little story. A little deliberately paced (slow) to be sure, but has a strong environmental message and great acting by Bruce Dern.      The only real criticism I have with Silent Running is that there are four songs sung by Joan Baez in the movie soundtrack; they are God-awful and I wanted to plug my ears with cotton every time she started warbling about trees, or granola, or giving peace a chance or whatever the heck she was caterwauling about.     This film clearly inspired \\"Moon\\", the terrific film from 2009 starring Sam Rockwell and directed by Duncan Jones; which is another deliberately paced but excellent \\"one-man act\\" film set on a space station. (Moon is similarly recommended, with 5 of 5 stars.)

B003P2WO5E|3.0|It must be tricky to try and create a coherent novel when you have 10 kicking around in your head. I'm excited that Sanderson has 10 books or so in mind for the series and it will be refreshing for an author to plan and foreshadow across his entire series. Nevertheless, it seems as though he is writing one long book and barely managed to get a plot arc into book 1. There were so many mysterious characters, cultures, and history, yet the plot was so bland in comparison. While finishing the novel, I felt that most of the tension in the book was created by Sanderson withholding some key details until the last few pages. It made for some very exciting chapters at the end, but the price was heavy: slogging through 900 pages of disconnected fragmented stories. I guess it was an interesting impressionistic approach to introduce the oh so well crafted world, but I had hoped for a little more entertainment. I'm excited to see what book 2 brings and it was a strong foundation for what could be excellent series.
B0013CUB7G|5.0|I bought this and it works on my playstation 4. I think the visuals and sounds are great. It feels like im at the concert with a gopro camera, no joke. Also I just wanna say its a great line up of songs. I own both the dvd and bluray and Id buy it again if anything were to happen to my disks.
B001IF252M|5.0|This works AMAZINGLY well! I used it on my TV's VGA input and the picture was great! All I had to do was pug it in and choose a display size and I was set.   I would highly recemend this product to any one using a Mac!
0786955570|5.0|There are tiles.  And there are spaces within those tiles.  everything else is the order of play.  Have fun with the Power cards.  A true roll of 20 means you level up from 1 to 2.  Otherwise you can level up through Treasure cards.  As in all D&D games, the more the merrier.        If you have ever played the TSR minigame Vampyre, you'll love this.   Count Strahd Von Zarovich ain't no Count Dracula.  ;)
B003NWS5AO|4.0|It took a few listens for this album to grow on me, especially since I've been in a Led Zeppelin revival phase of my life. But, now that I'm past my disappointment with the whole \\"this doesn't sound at all like Led Zeppelin\\" thing I am finding this CD quite enjoyable. It is not at all a rockin' album; rather, it is kind of rootsy country blues folk.<br /><br />Robert Plant's voice alternates from velvety smooth, almost whispery, to occasionally nearly reaching the falsetto heights of old. However, honestly, sometimes it was hard to tell it was him because the Plantish qualities he is known for are not as evident. Perhaps he was wise not to push it to that level. The tunes themselves are interesting and varied.<br /><br />The tracks sound a little \\"mono\\" to me (vs stereo) and so the music doesn't quite seem to resonate as deeply as I'd like. This gives it a vintage quality which I do find enjoyable. Perhaps this is a function of my sound system though.<br /><br />I think it is unproductive to compare this CD to Led Zeppelin, but it is very difficult not to do so! But try, for the sake of an honest interpretation of the music. Definitely listen to the samples here before you buy. If you're looking for Robert Plant to wail like he did with Led Zeppelin, you might be disappointed with this set. However, if you like Robert Plant for himself, you'll probably like this CD.<br /><br />Cheers!
0385732554|4.0|The Giver was a very interesting book and I enjoyed it very much.  The setting and world were very different, but it added to the storyline.  It was a little confusing at first, but I figured it out toward the end of the reading.  The details in the characters and the back story given to each one really helped me understand it more.
B003TML0VO|4.0|I ordered this CD because I have been a fan of Santana all my life, and I felt compelled to get it. Honestly though I was hesitant, and figured it wouldn't be very good...but I needed it to complete my Santana collection.<br /><br />YET...I am finding that I am enjoying the CD a great deal.<br /><br />I am not in general a fan of albums of cover tunes, but I think these are fun and fresh interpretations of some greats. They honor the originals but add a new dimension. Santana lets the talents of the guest artists shine through and doesn't need to grandstand to prove he is a great guitarist.<br /><br />On some of the tracks (notably \\"Riders on the Storm\\") there is that unmistakable Santana sound backed by a Latin groove. But on others, Carlos shows how versatile he really is as a musician by getting some new tones from his guitar.<br /><br />I thought the DVD that came with the CD was a waste of plastic. But the CD itself is quite enjoyable.<br /><br />Listen to the samples here and judge for yourself!
B000L3CHC0|5.0|No I didn't, but I told someone that and I think he beleived me. Bought this at a jewelry shop. Had looked at it on Amazon, but wanted to touch before buying. Paid an extra $100 at the shop to get the warranty. In hindsight, the warranty is only for 2 years and this watch will last much longer than that, so saving the money on Amazon is probably a good bet. Watch feels heavy and well made in the hand, but I never notice it on the wrist. I am a fan of Tissot, think you get Tag quality at less than half the price. This is the best-looking Tissot I have ever seen. No wonder it's so popular, the yellow hands pop on the black face but it remains subtle enough that this watch can be worn with anything. I wear this with a black suit or a white t-shirt. Looks good with both. I looked at Citizens because the eco-drive idea is neat, but Citizen is an inferior product compared to Tissot. As said before, Tags don't warrant the higher price. If you are reading this reveiw, it is likley because you are considering buying a watch in the $300-400 price range. This is a great watch at that price.
B000XZTGB6|5.0|RUN TIME is not 158 min but 128 min (there is no bonus track of 30 min).    Anyway, I love this DVD.
B003QCCS36|5.0|Lovely album, its got such a soulful, laid back, country folk vibe. Most songs just seamlessly flow from one to the other. Its no doubt that what makes this stand out is Ray's voice... raspy as ever. Also like the fact that the 'Pariah Dogs' are getting due recognition as well. Great CD... will be on repeat for a long time!
B0019HQIFE|5.0|I'm not a JM fan and I briefly know 1 or 2 song (The Heart of Life, Waiting on the world to Change).    But make no mistake, this should be in your library/collection! VQ and AQ are superb. Listen to Pino's bass... so refine and full of body. Steve on the drum is excellent. Of course, the stage boy JM you don't just submerge in his guitar talent but everything. Everyone in the Band is .... well go and get and you tell me :P    This piece of art-work is highly recommended.
B002JVWRAO|4.0|This is the fifth installment of Supernatural, and it is good however, its not their best, hopefully season six will blow us away.........................  On a side note Chuck is believed to be God, and Dean has a neckles that glow when near God, if you go back too season 4 you will see that Dean's neckles is covered up the whole time when near Chuck, then the next scean when he's not near Chuck you can see it, except for one time  when he's near Chuck, but it was only a glimps.
B003V6L94Q|5.0|First let me say I am a fan of the Zac Brown Band.  I was fortunate enough to get to see them perform in Ft. Pierce Florida two years ago.  It is still one of my top five concerts.  That being said, I also own everything else Zac Brown Band has released.  I was eagerly anticipating the release of this album.    So now I have had two days to listen and here is what I think.  I think it is beautifully written and performed and I really like the direction this band is moving in.  I love this album and haven't stopped playing it for the last two days.  Here is what I think of some of the songs:  Colder Weather:  Awesome, romantic, three-part harmony song.  Really nice!  Settle Me Down:  A ZBB Tradition - an island sorta reggae thing going on here - Love it!  Keep Me In Mind:  I have never heard Zac Brown sing such a personal, romantic song before.  His voice sounds exquisite on this song.  2nd favorite song on the album so far.  Knee Deep:  This is the one done with Jimmy Buffett.  I really like it and think it is an awesome follow-up to \\"Toes.\\"  No Hurry:  Reminds me of Darius Rucker.  Great lyrics and imagery.  Quiet Your Mind:  Average song, not that impressed.  Whiskey's Gone:  This one is a toe-tapper and I like it but it also reminds of the only ZBB song I don't like to date:  Sic 'em on a chicken.      THere are a total of 14 songs on this album and amazon is offering a great price on it.  Definitely worth the money! Buy IT!
030726999X|4.0|I thoroughly enjoyed all 3 although book #1 was my favorite.  While my husband thought some of the action was far fetched I said it isn't any different than some of the action you might see on film!  I recommend everyone read all 3.  I couldn't put them down.  I read all three this summer.
0316098337|5.0|Meant to be read as a 5 year old, understood as he thinks. Don't expect outside info if it doesn't pertain to  5 year old' interests.  I LOVED reading little Jack's story, and had a hard time putting the book down. Highly recommended!

0439023513|5.0|Walking into the local book store in Mid-July I wasn't expecting to find anything so amazing as the Hunger Games. It only took me 3 days to read it, same goes for Catching Fire. I had never heard of the series before I randomly came across the first in the triolgy, and I instantly fell in love with it. After Catching Fire I immediately got on Amazon and ordered Mockingjay, luckily enough for me it arrived the day before the release date! The second it arrived I was consumed once again. I don't want to spoil it for those who haven't read the final book yet, but it was very well written and kept me on my toes through out the whole book just like the others had. I'm still not sure how a felt about the ending, it was a bit of an awkward transition from the events leading up to it, but I may be biased because I never wanted to series to end. Mockingjay is a great 5 star book that outshines any others in its category.
0689865384|5.0|I got my kindle 3 recently, and this was the first book I picked up to read on it. It looked interesting, and I had heard people talking about it. I started it and finished it in less than a day. I actually had a hard time getting myself out of the book. It was a fun, entertaining read, and I've already started the second novel in the series. I just can't wait to find out what happens!
030726999X|5.0|Great book! Mr. Larsson definitely saved the best for last.  This book picks up right where The Girl Who Played With Fire left off and it's fast paced from beginning to end.  A definite must read.  This is a real page turner, you won't want to put it down.
0971407614|4.0|I had been active and working out for many years. I used to lift weight heavily. Then I got married. I spent more time with the wife and new family and lost the time I had to workout. Then I came across Mark's book...    I no longer want/or need to get big so bodyweight exercises are perfect. Furthermore, there are many pluses to bodyweight exercises..    1) Every workout requires some use of your entire body. Unlike the gym, where you lift for a certain muscle group only.  2) There is a great cardio aspect to the workout itself.  3) I feel more coordinated and in-tune with my own body. Something I never felt in all the years I had lifted.    I started out at the lowest level with the thought that it would be a cakewalk and that I would just blow right through. it. Yeah right...even the lowest level exercises are great.    The only con I see to the book is that the types of workouts (eg ladders, intervals, etc) are not clearly defined. With that said, I have found all the information I have needed at [...] in the forums.    I cannot recommend this book enough.
B000W4HJ44|5.0|The 2007 film based on the 2002 Broadway musical comedy and inspired by the 1988 film directed by John Waters is a triumph. Nikki Blonsky(in her first movie role) reprises the role of Tracy Turnblad(made famous by Ricki Lake and immortalized by Marissa Jaret Winikour)in the new version of Hairspray. Tracy(Blonsky)has one desire, to appear on the Corny Collins Show and win the heart of teen star Link Larkin(Zac Efron, Charlie St. Cloud), however, Velma van Tussle(Michelle Pfieffer, Stardust) is making sure Tracy's dream never come to past. But with the help of her Mom(John Travolta, Face/Off), Dad(Christopher Walken, The Dead Zone), her best friend Penny(Amanda Bynes, What I Like About You), and the show's sassy co-host Motormouth Maybelle(Queen Latifah, Last Holiday),Tracy will come out on top. This 2-disc DVD set is filled to the brim with special features, including a Hairspray timeline, a step-by-step on how to dance like the Corny Collins dancers, and deleted scenes like Tracy singing a heartfelt ballad. This film will make you feel you are actually in Baltimore in 1962 and dancing to the beat. Hairspray is the feel-good film that will leave a song in your heart forever. :)
B0036EH3WK|3.0|I have both positive and negative thoughts about this series (mostly positive).  What I liked for the most part was the character development, most of the backstories and at least the setup for various intrigues.  Unfortunately this was NOT a character driven series.  What I did not like was the failure to satisfactorily close MANY tracts and issues.  For the number of viewers invested in this show a lot more care should've been taken, but instead the viewer was exploited with the pretense of something that was never to be.  On the whole most seasons were at least \\"Good\\", and a few fantastic. However one thing is for certain... Season 6 is a burning mess of confusion and bad writing.  It's a shame because it was an opportunity for the writers to create closure for much of what had happened.  \\"Come with me\\" is used at least two to three times an episode in Season 6. Endless, pointless excursions ep after ep, back/forth and back/forth across the island usually for no worthwhile reason... characters switching loyalties countless times and for no worthwhile reason.  So many in fact that I lost track and almost lost interest completely.  When you look at season 6, other than the flash sideways scenes, most of the island scenes were basically worthless. And in the case of Jack's off-island scenes, sadly... just painstakingly boring.
B003O85W3A|3.0|Any band with as much time between releases should have done a much better job than this.  The album does have a couple of bright spots.  \\"Ready to Start\\" and \\"Sprawl II\\" are very decent tracks with a good amount of energy and creativity behind them.  However, it essentially stops there.  The creativity and energy that was so prevalent in Funeral (and to a much lesser extent in Neon Bible) is all but absent here.  Practically every track wanted to make me turn off the music and walk around a city listening to anything else.
B000GGOCIE|5.0|I first read this book in 1998 in my honors English class and I loved it.  Very detailed take on Arthurian Legend from a different prospective centered on the women.  The legend and the Age of King Arthur is vividly brought back to life in very descriptive and beautiful narrative. The places, the people all are brought alive in ones imagination when reading this novel. Recommend to all those who like Arthurian Legend.
0061766089|4.0|The idea behind design thinking is that innovation comes from thinking about things in terms of user experience, rather than thinking of ways to improve a feature and then letting designers in on the decision making when it's time to choose the color.<br /><br />If Henry Ford had used a focus group to help make decisions for his Model T, the thinking goes, he'd have ended up with a faster horse. Instead, you need to observe the users of your goods and services and be open to new ideas, even if they're not obviously feasible or profitable right away.<br /><br />This book argues persuasively for this attitude, and includes lots of entertaining and incisive examples where design focus and agility saved the day -- or made a new day possible. For inspiration, for arguments in favor of design thinking, or for guidance on how to move from the concept to application, this is a good book.
6304884419|5.0|The movie was fine. Since a duplicate was received as a gift, VERY disappointed in the lack of response from seller, californiamedia09 for not responding to my refund request.  Package never opened.  Request ignored twice!
0307266303|1.0|I just viewed the author's video that is posted with the book information here on Amazon. The author claims that indians run barefoot style into their late life, and NEVER get injured. That claim sort of makes me question the author's credibility. Is it possible that barefoot style could reduce injuries? Sure....anything is possible. The fact of the matter is, if you run a lot, the repeatitive motion is eventually going to cause an injury.  If you run a lot \\"late into your life\\", you are going to encounter multiple injuries, and have a very high probability of having to have a hip or knee replacement.
B002JVWR9U|5.0|[[ASIN:B003L77GH4 The Vampire Diaries: The Complete Second Season]] is brilliant, a must have if you love vampires, love stories and good looking men!
B003JTHXOK|5.0|The story is easy to read, and I didnt want to stop reading until it was over, and then I wished for more. Great book I highly recommend it
B003CIG7AE|3.0|I really had high hopes for this album--I absolutely loved their first album [[ASIN:B000E6GBV2 Everything All the Time]] (the follow-up [[ASIN:B000UVPKEU Cease to Begin]] approached \\"meh\\" territory with the exception of a few songs).  Before I got this album I saw Ben Bridwell and crew play some of the new material at Sasquatch Festival last May.  \\"Factory\\" and \\"Laredo\\" from Infinite Arms sounded good live.<br /><br />I've given this album a few runs through and there is something missing and it's hard to articulate.  \\"Heart\\" isn't the right word, but it's the first word that comes to mind.  This may be due to the fact that for this album, Bridwell is the only remaining member from the lineup that recorded \\"Everything All the Time.\\"  Overall the songs are less catchy and less genuine compared to [[ASIN:B000E6GBV2 Everything All the Time]] and to a lesser extent compared to [[ASIN:B000UVPKEU Cease to Begin]].  Bridwell's vocals seem over polished and over-produced.<br /><br />That being said, the album isn't a stinker.  There aren't any standouts like \\"Funeral,\\" \\"Monsters,\\" or \\"No One's going to love you\\" on this album, but there are some decent songs.  The symphony strings on \\"Factory\\" was a cool addition, \\"Laredo\\" was catchy (although I can't help but think that name dropping a southern town in an alt-county song as some sort of shtick.), and the Beach Boys-esque harmonizing on \\"Blue Beard\\" was interesting.<br /><br />There was a time when I would've listed Band of Horses as one of my favorite bands--let's hope they redeem themselves on their next album.  Also, be sure to catch them live as they put on a great show.  Side note:  former BOH-connected acts The Grand Archives and Sera Cahoone are worth checking out too!
0545310601|3.0|Spoilers    Rating this in sections, I'd give 2 stars each for the first 2 sections, and 4 or 5 to the last section. SC's intent through the series -- i.e., show war bad -- demanded a less than happy conclusion... which she delivered on, while still providing some measure of hope... a nice realistic finale that pulled no punches (though I wonder after Rue's and Prim's deaths if Collins has a thing against her younger sister :).    The first two sections were slowly paced and a bit chaotic. Collins introduced ideas that were dropped almost immediately (e.g., hallucinatory FX of drugs) and had some ridiculous plot points (e.g., shooting a plane w/ a bow and arrow.... not gonna happen, deciding to avalanche The Nut... that would have been early strategy #1). The final section, however, was typical Hunger Games style... fast paced, inventive, exciting.    As far as the KGP triangle character & plot development, nothing seemed out of realism for me, though I could have done w/ less introspection on K's part, though that's a hard cup to measure.     On a final, minor, sideways note, I felt like my mental image of the world was a bit off compared to SC's.... Never realized there were phones and cars in future world until the last section of the last book.
B002BU0DPE|5.0|Great sound FX!!! Bass is tremendous and chat quality is clear! Also, the greatest thing I must admit is..... mute button. Amazon is asking me to rate this item, but lists it as a game =/. Overall quality, I would give it 4.5 Stars out of 5.
B003NWS5AO|2.0|I have no idea why people would like this?  I love led Zeppelin and I liked Plants early solo albums (the first few).  But this music isnt anything I would want to listen to a second time.  I love Led Zeppelin maybe that's the problem, I like rock & roll!  I even like good soft rock, this is either in my book.  Anyway if he strikes Gold or Platinum with this, more power to him.  It's all the way over my heard than is all i can say.  I did by the way like Angel dance which is why I gave the whole CD a spin.  But other than that song, I dont care for it.  This CD in a way reminds me of the quirky music by Sam Phillips (the former Christian music singer) who the critics adore but she dont sell many CDs.

0345505387|4.0|I'm not much of a fan of graphic novels, but both the story and the artwork were very enjoyable.  There was more overlap in the story between OUTLANDER and THE EXILE than I was expecting, and as a diehard Gabaldon fan, I found that rather comforting.  Great fun to see familiar scenes brought to life in a different format like this!  And there are plot twists and surprises -- I won't go into details, but there is enough here to keep fans speculating for some time to come, about what it all means.    The artwork was very good, for the most part.  The artist does gorgeous work with landscapes, light, and color, and his characters' faces show a great deal of variety of emotional expression.  I thought his rendition of Claire was quite good.  Jamie's face fluctuates too much -- one minute he's just as I pictured him, the next minute he's a cartoon character who doesn't at all resemble the one described in the OUTLANDER books.  But overall, I think the artist hits the (admittedly very subjective!) mark far more often than he misses.  The uneven portrayal of Jamie's face -- and the frustrating lack of page numbers in this book! -- is the reason I gave the book 4 stars instead of 5.    Overall, I enjoyed it quite a lot.  I would have no hesitation in recommending THE EXILE to other OUTLANDER fans.    Karen
B001TKD4ZI|2.0|One of the silliest books I've read.  Well, read half of, for I couldn't even finish it.  Harlequin romance for vampires.  I thought it would be cute. It wasn't; it was cutsey. Maybe something for a teen with low expectations as to a book with a decent plot that is moderately well written. This is neither. Total waste of six bucks.  I'm embarrassed to even write this review showing I purchased this dreck.    I give this one and a half stars.  Two was being very kind.  How this got a four star average is beyond me.

087349976X|2.0|I really liked the cover project and I was going to buy the book but I am so glad I didn't. I checked it out at the library first and I am so glad I did. There are a couple of projects out of the 50 projects that are okay but the rest are very so-so. I'll do the cover bracelet but that's about it. The directions are definitely lacking. You can't see the project from all angles which makes the written directions even harder to follow. I like to see some pictures of the project in progress as not everyone can understand the directions as written. Oh and don't get me started on the WOTWS stupid abbreviation - there's plenty of space on the page - just write it FFS. Quite disappointing book so I'm glad I only paid the reservation fee at the library.
B0043HA1K0|5.0|its good to hear proper music from artists these days and this is a shining example. the Roots have always been at the top of their game but not necessarily recognized for it. John Legend sounds like he's been around 4ever but is one of the best young r&b singers today. for them to come together seems natural yet surprising at the same time. you get the best all wrapped up in a smooth package, sweet sounds.

Way too expensive for what you get. Boo with a capital B. It collects dust while my original xbox headset keeps me happy. Don't bother.

B003ASLJK4|5.0|Clint Eastwood has some range.  There, I said it.  He's not just some sneering tough guy getting ready to punch a thug in the mug--he can play a soft-spoken, artistic, touchy-feely guy, and he proves it with THE BRIDGES OF MADISON COUNTY, a film he also directs.  (This guy does it all.)  And his romantic counterpart, pray tell?  Meryl Streep.  'Nuff said.  You know this film is going to contain some powerful performances before the very first frame.<br /><br />But what I really love about this movie are the various \\"flash forwards\\", when the film jumps from the Sixties to the present, as Streep's character's children (Annie Corley and Victor Slezak) read and discuss their mother's memoirs.  In essence, they learn of their mother's passionate affair simultaneously with the viewer, and it's a marvelous dramatic device.  We all watch as lonely Francesca Johnson, home alone while her husband and children are away for the week at the state fair, falls deeply in love with 'National Geographic' photographer Robert Kincaid, on assignment in Iowa to take pictures of the local covered bridges.  And as reason and fidelity and duty eventually give way to emotion and passion we are all reminded of the total fragility of the human condition.  Eastwood and Streep are marvelous together; their chemistry sparks this very tender love story--a love story with far-reaching consequences for all the film's characters.  The climactic scene when Francesca must choose between family and love is worth the purchase price alone; THE BRIDGES OF MADISON COUNTY is a beautifully crafted, exceptional film.<br />--D. Mikels, Author, The Reckoning
B001MEJY8W|5.0|Martyrs is a bone chilling flick from France not for the feint hearted.  I do not want to reveal too much of the plot so as to deminish its affect.  A secret cult kidnaps preteen girl, tortures in an effort to gain insight into the next world meaning life after death.  The film begins with a tween excaping, subsequently institionalized, released as a young woman, tracks down a couple living a seemly normal life in the suburbs for the sole purpose of exacting revenge.  Her girl friend joins her following the rampage.  This film reveals how cruel humans can be towards eachother a fact well known to all students of history.  If you are ready for this film buckle up and go for the ride.

B001MYIXAC|4.0|Well, the movie came in brand new and the movie played perfectly--except for the subtitles. I thought, since it said \\"This product contains the theatrical subtitles\\" that they weren't lying. I watched the movie and wasn't even a minute into it when I noticed the subtitles didn't match. That's one of my major pet peeves when it comes to DVDs. I realized my mistake though: I bought from a merchant but not directly from a seller endorsed by Amazon or just Amazon itself, so that's probably why.
B001OQCV2E|2.0|There's plenty of apocalypse to go around in writer-director Roland Emmerich's derivative, overlong disaster epic.

B003U0AHBO|4.0|ROBIN HOOD is a solid movie; it is less on the Errol Flynn format than most people expected and more on setting up the background for the blossoming of the infamous Robin Hood, and if the last few minutes of the film can be believed, there is likely a sequel in the mind of Ridley Scott!  Once the audience accepts the fact that they are not in store for film about a happy-go-lucky thief who robs form the rich to pay the poor then this film settles into a fine examination of the corrupt government of England, barely surviving during King Richard the Lionheart's (Danny Huston) 10 year absence in the Crusades.  We see the state of the Church, the presence of espionage and greed that depletes the people of England with high taxes and confiscation of land and food and seed to plant.  It is a sad state of affairs with only a few strongholds of honesty and survival - focused here on Nottingham, governed by the blind Sir Walter Loxley (Max von Sydow) and his daughter Marion (Cate Blanchett), the young boys having taken to the forest as feral huntsmen, and  whose grain houses are pilfered to the point of starvation.  Along comes Robin Longstride (Russell Crowe) who has been asked by the dying king to deliver his crown to the Queen (Eileen Atkins), which in turn makes his smarmy brother John (Oscar Isaac) the new king.  One evil treacherous Godfrey (Mark Strong, the Hollywood movies' requisite bad guy) wiles his way into the good graces of King John, ostensibly replacing the court advisor William Marshall (William Hurt) and planning for the destruction of Robin Longstride. Meanwhile Robin takes refuge with the Loxley household, being named 'husband' of the widowed Marion for protection.  The remainder of this very long film  is about Robin's learning about his heritage, his participation in squelching the Normandy Invasion, his gathering of his loyal merry men - Friar Tuck (Mark Addy), Little John (Kevin Durand), Will Scarlet (Scott Grimes) and Allan A'Dayle (Alan Doyle) - becoming Robin Hood, his teaching the feral boys of the forest how to fight, and his falling in love with Marion, all under the watchful eyes of the Sheriff of Nottingham (Matthew Macfayden) and Godfrey.  All's well that end's well and let's hope that screenwriter Brian Helgeland has a sequel ready to start filming with Ridley Scott!<br /><br />The scenery is beautiful when it is not all muddy and overcast and John Mathiesen has captured the flavor of 12th century England well.  Marc Streitenfeld composed the score that is for the most part embarrassingly unremarkable.  One of the finest aspects of the film can be attributed to Ron Diamond who is in charge of the terrific art of the opening and closing titles - really fine art work and animation.  It is a mature person's ROBIN HOOD - and it works very well!

0345505387|1.0|I'm also a diehard fan, I'm in the middle of reading the entire series for the fourth... or is it fifth time. I just can't seem to find any other books that interest me as much. The Outlander series is such a wonderful, wild ride. But the graphic novel, well what can I say? It arrived today and I read it this afternoon (with a nap in the middle). The story follows the original plot line quite well with the exception of the addition of Kenneth who presence is never explained.     The first paintings of Jamie and Claire were nice, Jamie especially. He seemed a little younger and more innocent than I envisioned, but what do I know? I wonder if he was drawn after the image of Gabriel Aubry was circulated on YouTube? The similarity between the first image of Jamie and the image of Gabriel is striking. However I am agreement with a previous reviewer, the images from page to page are not similar enough. They seem to have been drawn or painted in a haphazard manner, sometimes it seems they are even drawn by different artists. Many times it was difficult to follow who was who, and all the men look very similar to each other.      The original image of Claire, shown in the back of the book is lovely, however I didn't see a single image in the book itself that looks like that drawing.  For what it's worth, I've always envisioned Julia Ormond as being Claire. She has such an expressive face; you can tell what she is thinking just by looking in her eyes.     But this book, well I'm sorely disappointed. Diana, please keep writing novels, I'll keep reading them!
B00026WUAU|5.0|I was still in elementary school during Bob Dylan's 60s heyday, and didn't discover his work until I went to college in the mid-to-late 1970s. (I attended Oberlin, where Dylan, not surprisingly, was among the most requested artists on the college radio station.) As a result of my somewhat belated introduction to the canon, I experienced \\"Street Legal\\" as my first \\"new\\" Dylan album, and more than thirty years later, it remains one of my absolute favorites. Unfairly criticized at the time of its original release for its use of gospel elements--notably, a trio of backup singers--it is one of Dylan's richest and most satisfying sets, both musically and lyrically. The opening track, \\"Changing of the Guards,\\" awash with compelling imagery, may be read on a number of levels. A brooding epic in the tradition of the artist's mid-60s classics, the song is by turns mythic, wildly romantic, and political, and has as good a claim to being serious poetry as anything Dylan has ever written. Three other ambitious narratives, \\"No Time To Think,\\" \\"Senor (Tales of Yankee Power),\\" and \\"Where Are You Tonight? (Journey Through Dark Heat),\\" are every bit as rewarding. At the same time, the disc offers up scorching soul ballads like \\"Baby Stop Crying\\" and \\"Is Your Love In Vain?,\\" where the music itself sends chills down your spine. Add to the pot the blistering electric blues of \\"New Pony,\\" and the result is as eclectic as it is brilliant. Throughout, the singing ranks among Dylan's most raw and passionate. When it first appeared in 1978, \\"Street Legal\\" marked a new direction for Dylan--one that foreshadowed the more overtly religious outings to come, and one with which not everyone was comfortable. It continues to age well, however, and the somewhat muddy original mix is greatly improved by the recent remastering. \\"Street Legal\\" deserves to finally be accorded \\"classic\\" status. Such recognition is long overdue!
B002N5N5LG|5.0|I'm not going to spend much time talking about how much I like Community.  The first season, like most, has some ups and downs but it quickly proved itself to be a bitingly funny comedy that could easily hang with the other Thursday night big boys on NBC.     That being said, this DVD set has ruined me for all other television shows.  There are outtakes, alternative scenes, producer's cuts, mini episodes, a highlight reel, two featurettes, and 25 commentaries with the cast/crew (that's one for each episode).  Clearly a lot of love has gone into this show AND the DVD content.  Of course, how can I look at other shows the same way again?  Most can't even match up to half of what this set offers.    Right now, Amazon is selling this for 17.99, and you can get 5 dollars off if you put in the code SONYFIVE.  Even if you were paying retail price for this, you'd be getting a MAJOR steal.  Buy this to not only support Community and its creators, but to support how truly great DVD can be with the right amount of effort involved.

B003TML0VO|5.0|I have every Santana album and every album he ever guested on.  Some albums were not great but who is great for 43 years? Carlos Santana.  I can not fathom how anyone could give this CD 1 star, obviously they have overdosed on Backstreet Boys.  2 stars, too much Blue Man Group.  3 stars, you need to quit listening on your iPod.  4 stars, OK maybe there are 1 or 2 not so great cuts.  I gave this CD 5 stars because some of Carlos' guitar playing actually sent chills through me.  This CD is vintage Santana whaling, weeping, singing guitar.  No one can get more out of a single held note like Carlos.  Take the 1 - 3 star raters for who they are, either neophytes, or old rockers who have lost their hearing, or polka lovers.  If you are a Santana fan you will like this CD.

I would recommend watching the special features before watching the movie for a fascinating look at how the young girls were chosen to act in this movie.  WOW!
030726999X|5.0|Potential readers be warned, THE GIRL WHO KICKED THE HORNET'S NEST is most definitely NOT a stand-alone novel. To wander too deeply into any review of this novel is to risk learning some tidbits that will spoil the effect of the fabulous surprises in store for the readers that start at the beginning.<br /><br />What an exhilarating end to a monumental cracker-jack edge-of-the-seat trilogy. Lisbeth Salander recovers in the hospital from her devastating head wound and awaits trial for three murders and the attempted murder of her father, Alexander Zalachenko, Soviet intelligence defector. Mikhael Blomkvist, under the legal direction of S&auml;po Constitutional Protection Director Torsten Edklinth and his associate, Monica Figuerola, work desperately against the clock to provide the ironclad proof that will impugn the perverted testimony of the psychologist, Teleborian,  and the members of the internal government cabal who were ultimately responsible for the abysmal treatment of a young Salander at the hands of the Swedish government. Erika Berger leaves Millennium to be editor-in-chief at Svenska Morgon-Posten, Sweden's largest daily paper and her life is immediately turned into a living hell.<br /><br />There are any number of reasons why this trilogy has become such a world-wide phenomenon. The intricacies of a plot which has so many threads that twist, tie, weave, undo, wander off into bizarre directions and ultimately come together in this fabulous finale would be reason alone but there is so much more.<br /><br />All of the characters are well-developed and positively leap off the page with vibrant clarity but the lead of the piece, Lisbeth Salander, is worth the price of admission all by herself -  a skinny, hard-edged but attractive, on-again off-again feminist; a tattoed punk wild child with bisexual tendencies; an extraordinary computer hacker and skilled journalistic researcher with a photographic memory; a skilled boxer; a survivor of abuse whose difficult memories of rape and sexual assault have turned into an abiding hatred and a desire for revenge on misognynists and a wealthy recluse whose desire for privacy makes Howard Hughes look like a party animal. If Lisbeth Salander isn't the most bizarre and off-the-wall literary character ever created, she'd certainly be a front-runner in any ranking.<br /><br />While the Swedish courtroom scenes are not as rigidly structured and as formalized as one would expect in a North American setting under common law jurisprudence, the lawyer's interrogations during Lisbeth's trial are positively electric and will keep any reader absolutely glued to the book reading until the sun rises at the crack of stupid!<br /><br />The three rather disparate themes of journalistic ethics and performance, government misconduct and the worldwide treatment of women that ranges from chauvinism to misogyny maintain their place of importance throughout all three novels. It was clear that Stieg Larsson had major axes to grind and, like Charles Dickens, he was definitely unafraid of using his creative writing skills and his stories as a platform for social commentary.<br /><br />For those few readers who complain about unfinished ideas, I say \\"Get over it!\\" It was obvious that Stieg Larsson had much more in mind for Lisbeth Salander in the future but, sadly, his early death deprived a breathless world of what might have been. As countless authors have attempted to provide an ending to Charles Dickens' THE MYSTERY OF EDWIN DROOD, perhaps some future writers will attempt to put some closure to Lisbeth Salander's life.<br /><br />In the meantime, savour THE GIRL WHO KICKED THE HORNET'S NEST, 'cause they ain't no more and that's all she wrote!

030745455X|2.0|More adventures with Mikael Blomkvist and Lisbeth Salander.  This time they get involved with reports on a sex trafficking operation.  A book will be published but then the two authors are brutally killed--and Salanders fingerprints are found on the murder weapon.  Blomkvist is sure she's innocent and tries to prove it while Salander herself is being stalked by a vicious killer.<br /><br />First off you have to read \\"The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo\\" to know the characters.  That was a long, complex but absorbing book.  This one starts off OK but author Larsson throws far too many characters at us.  It got so I had a little cribsheet at the back of the book to figure out who's who!  He keeps giving us more up until the half-way point--that's 300 pages!  Then the book has some truly ridiculous and confusing twists and turns.  Also there's a LOT of time these characters spend on the computer.  That got tired real fast.  The first part of the book was OK (that's why it gets 2 stars) but it quickly falls apart as it progresses.  By the end I was confused and actually bored.  I won't be seeking out the third book.  BTW--this book doesn't really have an ending--it just sets up the third book.

B003EYVXYQ|1.0|Is it just me or was George Romero trying to get some comedy cues from Zombieland? Key word in that sentence is \\"trying\\" I dont mind comedy in my horror but dont go too slapstick when youre advertising a crazy horror experience.     Secondly were the writers just lazy or did they actually think the main characters were orginial and cool? Whats this? Reluctant leader tagged along by plucky second in command and butchy female soldier type? I never saw that coming! >.< You know I dont mind these archtypes but seriously thats just sad, Id rather watch Diary at least that cast was enjoyable.      Worst of all is this plot. It seemed like he took two halves of two different stories and stapled them together.  I mean it would have rather been more interesting to detail the story between two opposing clans by themselves surrounded by zombies with more depth or some guard trying to survive zombiegeddon, but not both at the same time! And again whats with Romero trying to get us to sympathize with the freakin zombies they're zombies afterall, they want to eat us! I dont care if they can sometimes put the square peg in the round hole I dont want to hug them.     All in all I think if youre wanting to see a new zombie movie check out I sell the dead or pontypool its def worth your time

Young Jim Hawkins works at his mother's inn until a strange pirate, Billy Bones, takes up residence and hires him to keep watch for the dangerous man with one leg. Violence rocks the community when a blind pirate named Pew delivers the dreaded black spot to Billy, causing him to fall over dead of a heart attack, and the pirates attack the inn hoping to find his treasure. But Jim has already claimed the most important part of Billy's treasure, a mysterious map with directions to Skull Island. Jim boards a shop with a doctor, the squire, and the charismatic Long John Silver who quickly charms all three of them until Jim stumbles upon John's part in a plot to mutiny with several of the other sailors, kill those not with them (including Jim), and claim the treasure for themselves. I'd only seen the movie adaptations of this story, so I was surprised to see at the portrayal of John, who was far more slippery, honorable, and smart that I expected. The story is a sure winner with children who love adventure stories, even in the violence can be a little graphic, but my seven-year-old daughter was unphased by it and couldn't wait each night to hear another couple of chapters. The story is every boy's dream: secret treasure, heroic actions, villains who are overcome, and a safe return home with an amazing story to tell.

0385523904|4.0|I really enjoyed this look into North Korea. For one, knowing nothing about the country other than what I've seen on TV or online, which doesn't amount to much, despite modern technology. Nothing to Envy: Ordinary Lives in North Korea brings us face-to-face with six people who lived, worked and loved in a country that defies description in it's simplicity and drudgery.<br /><br />No electricity is the norm in most of the country. A light bulb and communal TV in most places outside the capital. Neighborhood spies, or block supervisors, keep everyone in line, and fraternization that hasn't been pre-approved isn't allowed. Add into this a population that is very deliberately kept in the dark about so much, including the rest of the world, and absolute adoration for their \\"god-president\\" and you have an almost Middle Aged feudal system that is brutal and shocking.<br /><br />Nothing to Envy: Ordinary Lives in North Korea is a look into George Orwell's 1984 but worse in many respects. The majority of the people are sub-human,with little hope of improving their lives in any way, shape or form. It's about who you know, or who you're related to. One can understand why a few are willing to risk their lives to leave it all behind.<br /><br />It wasn't always this way, as author Barbara Demick points out, when there was a Soviet Union, North Korea had backing and a lot more \\"wealth\\", albeit limited. Her narrative follows six people who ultimately escaped and now live in the West. One thing that struck me was their surprise at how little they knew about the world outside North Korea; they simply didn't.<br /><br />Ultimately, no one who hasn't lived it can fully understand what life under a totalitarian dictatorship is like, but this book will at least open the door and let you look inside.
B002VX3RCW|5.0|I first purchased the Lamaze Mortimer the Moose for my nephew. He absolutely loves Mortie, as we call him, so I ordered Sir Prance A-Lot to have at my house for him to play with. Like Mortie, Sir Prance A-Lot is visually stimulating with many different textures and patterns that my nephew enjoys. The tail rings are great for teething, though he does seem to like chewing on the feet of Sir Prance A-Lot. The squeak element in Sir Prance A-Lot's knight always draws his attention. And you can dangle Sir Prance A-Lot above him for long periods of time, the moving feet and the sound of the bell ringing seem endlessly fascinating to my nephew.    Because of my nephew's response to Mortie Moose and Sir Prance A-Lot toys my sister-in-law ordered the Lamaze Early Development Toy Olivia the Owl for my nephew to have at his grandparents house. Basically we love the Lamaze Early Development Toys and cannot recommend them enough. Every child should have at least one. Or three.
B001EOQWF8|5.0|The first half of the movie is a 10, the second half is not as good but the ride of the first half more than makes up for it.  Also MUST see it on Blu-ray, it would be a shame to watch it on regular DVD, the difference is like looking through a dirty window or opening the window.
0393327655|4.0|This was a book sold by the Thriftbooks. My expectation was how quickly I received the book. It took almost two weeks as I didn't take the expedited delivery option. I would definitely love to have it a bit earlier.
0345505387|4.0|It's suppose to be FUN!  For those of you that didn't realize it was a Graphic Novel, a.k.a glamorized comic book,  before buying it, I'm surprised you would even post a review stating the fact that you didn't even read what was offered before hitting the \\"buy\\" button.      I bought the book, actually I bought 3 of them, and read it in the spirit it was created in, and enjoyed immensely!
0765326353|5.0|I LOVED Way of Kings.  That being said, it took me a while to get into the book.  I was dissappointed at first, because it took me SO LONG TO CARE. There's just so much build, it's hard to get into.  But, Sanderson has never failed to impress me so I kept an open mind and stuck with it (It was never painful, however, to pick it up and read, I just wasn't as eager about doing so as in any of his other novels for awhile)  By the end, I wasn't disappointed. I feel that most of my opinions are stylistic preferences more than anything else. For example:  1. I just like Sanderson's style of writing.  I'm of the belief that you should kill your darlings and omit needless words. I like it clean. I like it concise. I don't want an author to try to impress me with their flashy vocab. I want them to tell me a story. More importantly, I want them to take me into that story, and hopefully lose myself. And like every other Sanderson book I've read, Way of Kings lived up to this expectaion.  2. The action scenes were intelligent.  I've never held a sword in my life, or have had magical powers. Without knowing these things, it'd be nice to have them explained to me simply so I know what I'm seeing/reading/whatever. Many have complained that Sanderson's fight scenes are like video game fight scenes. Well I PREFER that, they make sense. I'm a fairy logical person, if I was ever in a fight to the death, I would be logically thinking through each move (I would hope)  3. Characters  It took me longer to get into these characters than I'd care to admit. Probably because, though I like the main characters, I like seeing my protagonists succeed. There wasn't a whole lot of that at the beginning of the book. Dalinar is pretty much being screwed over. Shallan is a nervous wreck. Kaladin is depressed and moping. And Szeth... actually I quite liked any scene with Szeth, so nevrmind abot him. Once things started turning around (And particularly toward the end) I was much happier.  4. Magic  I don't want a waving of a magic wand and then seeing the results. For that, I'd go watch Sailor Moon. But a scientific magic system makes logical sense to me and tests my understanding.    I really don't know what to say. If I didn't trust Sanderson wholeheartedly, I'd probably give it a 4.  But I do. He never fails to deliver, even if it took a little longer in this book than his others. But its 1008 pages for a reason, s**t has to be explained.  I think it passes the test when days later, I start to think about the characters in the midst of something else. When thinking of Kaladin as I cleaned my office, I thought to myself \\"Wow, I didn't realize how much I cared about thoses characters/this book.\\" Well played, Sanderson, well played.  Go buy it, read it.  If you haven't read  Sanderson's other work, go read those.  Then buy it, read it.  You'll like it.  If not, eh. It's probably a preference thing rather than any fault of the book itself
B000003TBP|5.0|From the very first time I heard this at a friend's house shortly after its release - hey!  on Devil's Haircut that's the bassline from I Can Only Give You Everything, does he give credit for that?? - until yesterday - why did I never identify that Desafinado sample on Readymade before?? - this album boggles my mind.  Beck is a musical genius; now that I know I can trust him to cite his influences and/or acquisitions, I sometimes wish his more current work were as creative as Odelay.
0739344269|4.0|Metaphors in this book are great! Makes you remember your physical sciences class in college.   Most commercial reviews indicate that the book is about explaining how there can be a universe without a divine intervention. I am not sure that is well illustrated.  And that will probably never be done as also indicated in this book.  Great read fun stuff i recommend it greatly to anyone who likes physical phenomena.
068817776X|4.0|Little is written about Jewish survivors who successfully hid from the Germans and managed to avoid the horrors of concentration camps.  This is an interesting account of one such woman, Edith Hahn, who managed to hide in plain sight, as the wife of a German Nazi.  Her story begins with a description of her family and childhood.  As an Austrian Jew, she was forced to move into a ghetto and then sent to a labor camp.  When she returned home from the labor camp she was supposed to report for deportation to a \\"work camp.\\"  Instead, she went underground and hid.  With the help of a Christian friend, she obtained false identification papers and moved to Germany where she met her soon-to-be husband, Werner Vetter.<br /><br />Well written, this book is interesting and face-paced.  Miraculously, numerous documents and photographs survived World War II and are featured in the book.  The reader sympathizes with Edith and feels her anxiety and worry over her situation.  I would have liked to read more about her life after Munich and where she ultimately ended up.  Overall, this was a very good book.

B003PIUC02|5.0|I shall keep it very short and sweet. If you are a Blu-ray collector must have title in your collection. If not.... definitely a must see. If you don't you have no idea what you are missing. I bought the Blu-ray from Amazon... and waiting for Season Two. This is like 24 it sucks you into it, that you even wont feel like getting up  to walk near the fridge to get a bottle of water.
0765326353|5.0|For some reason I had not realized that Brandon Sanderson was coming out with a new novel until I ran into a copy at a Hastings store whilst I was wasting some time.  I went straight home and ordered it on Amazon (imagine my shock to find out that it hadn't been released yet - why was it on the shelves at Hastings three days early?!?). Regardless, I am absolutely horrified by this novel.  You might wonder why.  Please let me explain.<br /><br />I adored the character building that Brandon Sanderson did in Warbreaker, and was eager to read something new from him.  Reading the description seemed mildly interesting, but I have to admit the major draw was having read his continuation of Robert Jordan's novel.  My theory was that since I had enjoyed that, and Warbreaker, surely I should give this a chance.  Oh MY GOD.  I was absolutely stunned to find myself drawn into a fantastical world of love and betrayal, politics and death, class warfare, race warfare, and amazing fight choreography.  WOW.<br /><br />Then I realized, it is going to potentially be 10 novels and I just CRINGED.  I had begun Robert Jordan's work three novels into his projected 10-novel series, The Wheel of Time.  Ouch.  I thought I'd been smart not starting from the first novel, it saved me a few years of waiting.  Sigh.  I adore that series but I am tired of reading it. I want to see a conclusion to it.  I say this while terribly sad, of course, that Mr. Jordan has left us. :(  What a bright star the fantasy world has seen diminish in that man's passing.<br /><br />I do pray that Mr. Sanderson does keep this to 10 novels max, and doesn't space them out too horribly.  Please, Mr. Sanderson, if you value our sanity, do not go traipsing off on too many other paths while writing this series!  I get that writers have to have a break from their characters from time to time to refocus, but don't be gone too long or too often.  There is a responsibility an author and reader agree to when embarking on a lengthy journey of this nature to support one another! :)<br /><br />Essentially, the main plotline revolves around the centuries-old fall of a group called the Knights Radiant.  Their magical armor and weapons are all that remain of their protection of society against the Desolation - where Voidbringers wreak havoc on their world and their people.  Very little is now known in this time of what these knights did, how they did it, or why they ultimately left.  And what became of the mysterious Voidbringers? Were they destroyed? The histories are vague...<br /><br />In this land of Alethkar, their homes have long been virtually abandoned to fight a continuous battle on the Shattered Plains, begun after the assassination of their king, Gavilar.  There is a real fear their homeland will fall while they continue a seemingly endless war against the culprits, the Parshendi, far from home.  Highprinces are against highprinces, jockeying for power and position, never working together against the Parshendi, to the loss of all.<br /><br />Brightlord Dalinar Kholin begins to have visions of times past, coming to understand more and more of what occurred in the midst of his crazed highstorm ravings and feverishly seeking answers in the ancient book called, \\"The Way of Kings\\".  High political maneuvering, assassinations, and betrayal haunt his discoveries and the eventual tests of both his faith and honor.  And what are the highstorms?  Brutal tempests that can tear flesh from bone - what are they really?<br /><br />Brightlord Dalinar Kholin and his virtual nemesis, Brightlord Sadeas, share an oath.  A pact made upon the assassination of their last king, Gavilar,Dalinar's brother, to protect the new king - Dalinar's nephew Elhokar.  But what are Sadeas' REAL intentions?  Are his maneuvers still meant to protect the king?  And how can Dalinar \\"Unite them,\\" as his visions told him he MUST do?<br /><br />The man Kaladin, reduced to slavery by the greed of a man he saved, does his best tosurvive in a world bent on his destruction. With natural leadership skills and insane fight-style, he seems to inherently become \\"in charge\\" wherever he goes.  Desolation follows him too, as death often occurs under his leadership. But his light continues to shine, literally, as he discovers talents he did not know he possessed tied to his honor and loyalty to his men.  His partner-in-crime, a spren called Syl, is a mystery.  Why can this spren appear to him, speak to him, help him... in a manner seemingly completely at odds with spren-like behavior?  Daily, this spren seems to become more attuned to him and give haunting hints to times past and the symbiotic relationship they must share in order to survive.  His new-found gifts, too, are a mystery.  Why him, why now?<br /><br />Shallan is a desperate young woman driven to theft in order to try to save her family's lands and titles.  However in this process, she discovers there is far more going on than she ever suspected, and her family might be more embroiled in it than she could have believed.  Driven to betray her brilliant mentor Jasnah, she begins to understand that she is part of an unfolding cataclysm and must learn very quickly in order to survive the coming events.  In order to help herself, her mentor, and the world... she must learn.  Quickly.  Something is coming.<br /><br />In the midst of this are the magical armor and weapons of the ancient Knights Radiant - the Shardplate and Shardblades.  These are bitterly fought over among highprinces and envied and desired by the Parshendi, who seem to be seeking someone or something in particular, throwing wave after wave after wave of soldiers against the Alethi.<br /><br />Having begun this madness, the assassin Szeth-son-son-Vallano, Truthless of Shinovar, carries the weight of countless screams... the blood of his victims... and the guilt of what he has done.  It is the way, he must do as he is told by whoever holds his oathstone. Owner after owner orders him to commit murder after murder, and he always succeeds.  He continues to wreak havoc to no known end.  Why is he sent to do these things?  What is the goal?<br /><br />I LOVED this book. There was so much attention to detail in the world-building and characters!  I truly became engrossed in their decisions and the struggles that come from deciding exactly WHAT is the right thing to do. If you value honor and integrity and the morals that come into play with power and strife, this is the BOOK FOR YOU!  The fight sequences were BRILLIANTLY written in my opinion.  I could literally almost picture myself there!<br /><br />To me, ultimately, a book is something I read to become transported into another world - to be able to FEEL the characters - their love, their hate, their humanity, their choices, their pain, their laughter, and their progression through the adventures they have and the things they must do.  This book accomplished that for me, and I can think of no higher praise from a true bibliophile.  I am NOT the type to give five stars to a book just because I liked it - it has to be truly exceptional.  This was.  Read it. Love it. Be transported into it.

030726999X|4.0|The final book of Stieg Larsson's Dragon Tattoo series is a wonderful conclusion to the story of his heroine Lisbeth Salander.  After reading the first two books in the series this one is a must.  So sad that Stieg Larsson died just as his books became sensations.
039472903X|5.0|I am the rare coach/consultant in the web space who insists on sticking to the basics of Return on Investment and making sure that money spent on the Internet results in actual sales of the client's products or services.<br /><br />That's why I returned to this classic advertising book after too long away from it.  So many of David Ogilvy's critical observations (some are from the 50's and 60's) still resonate after all this time.  Focusing on the client's point of view is still the essence of good advertising.<br /><br />His insights and advice on headline writing are still particularly helpful in this short-attention-span era---using his concepts for web headlines, email newsletter subject lines and blog posts.<br /><br />If you purport to be a marketer, you should have this book.
B002RWKSII|2.0|Being a fan of the great George Gershwin I was looking forward to hearing what Brian Wilson, another musical genius, does with his rights to work with the Gershin music.  The CD is a bit of a disappointment.  The music is beautiful as is all Gershwin music.  I only wish Wilson would have produced the wonderful harmony of the Beach Boys in most of the music.  Unfortunately his solo voice does not do justice to the songs.  So in conclusion this album is about a 2 star and it could have been much better.
B003V5PPZG|5.0|Plain and simple, this album isn't for everybody. Alot of people won't have patience or the tolerance to listen to this as it should be listened to. On the other hand, I gave it a try. At first listen to the lead single, I thought it was \\"OK\\" but WTF is with this new sound but after hearing it another 2 times, I loved it and when they performed it live on MTV VMA's, made it even better, not to mention the video for it. Now ask for the album, o man was I pissed. I expected something between Meteroa and MTM, WRONG! but I figured since I took time to download I may as well listen again from the way they wanted the album to be played and yes, my opinion changed. I've been playing this everyday since it's release. It's really a different experience and feel when you play it all the way through (interludes and all) it all ties in together good.  Only thing I can say is I wish they had one more song like Blackout which is my favorite, then Waiting For The End and Buring In The Skies.  Again! I'm not a fan hyping it up just because I am a fan. I really heard the album in a different way once I put my personal expectations aside and gave it a chance for what it was and what it was is something new and DEFINITELY not Hybrid Theory or any of their previous work. So we all have opinions and I don't blame nobody for hating the album because I was close to trashing it too. To the people interested or debating, download it or borrow it and playbit through a few times and put your mind somewhere different and actually listen to the songs for what they are and not judging and comparing to their old ones.
B003EYVXSW|1.0|I do not understand it!! This movie received rave reviews. Even Roger Ebert, a critic against this type of genre, gave this movie high marks. With much convincing, I brought my girlfriend to see it. The movie's premise was interesting, but the movie was dull, annoying and the actors were very one dimensional. Cardboard cut outs will do a better acting job. I wish I had my money back, when this movie was over. The ending stinks. It left you hanging, so you have to probably endure another two hours of dread and boredom with a sequel in the near future. Oh boy!! Can't wait to cross that movie off my list to see, when it comes down the pike. Very disappointing to say the least.
B003EYVXT6|2.0|This is not a review for the DVD, it is for the movie itself.  The previews for this movie were misleading I thought, making it look like a thriller. This is not a thriller, it is more of a sci-fi drama. At the very end it does turn a little \\"thriller\\"ish - for about 10 minutes.  I found this movie very disturbing. And for everyone who would care to be forewarned, there is a rape scene.  I was not aware of this when I saw the movie. I believe people should be warned of such scenes.    This is not to say the movie is not \\"good,\\" just that I personally did not like it.
B003TML0VO|3.0|Carlos Santana is a guitar god; only in my dreams do I have anything like his creativity, expressiveness and abilities. Yet listening to his recordings of these (mostly) great songs I don't hear any serious creativity in them, just Carlos doing his thing. Worse, many of these songs, including Can't You Hear Me Knocking, Bang a Gong, and Smoke on the Water, just don't fit with his style--they need to be played down and dirty and that just isn't in Santana's style cabinet in this century. Too bad, I was excited to read about Guitar Heaven but the reality doesn't live up to it.

B003V4AK8E|1.0|I've been looking for a PS3 controller that is like the Xbox 360 controller, since I find that one much more comfortable than the dualshock.  I decided to give this one a try because it looked promising.    Two problems I had with it.  The major one being that it doesn't stay connected to the PS3.  It will be working fine, lose connection, and then connect again seconds later.  Obviously this is a huge deal with a gaming controller.  Secondly, it's just not comfortable.  The \\"contoured grip\\" they have added to the controller digs into your skin.  Doesn't look too bad in the pictures but I can't see how anyone could put up with it.    Had no choice but to return it.  If you're looking for a third party controller that is similar to the 360, look elsewhere.
B003UYUR10|5.0|I enjoyed the movie a lot.<br />Down side, Gyllanhaal was just not that believable as an leading man - action character -<br />though stunts were really impressive... chemistry between him and gemma aterton was minimal,<br />except for a few touching moments at the end..<br />But, plot moved along well, special effects great...  Writing witty...<br />Ending very satisfying...<br />Nice escapist 116 minutes.<br />Oh, Ben Kingsley was just great, as usual...

If you get it, you'll wonder why it's not standard equipment.
0385736002|5.0|An absolutely wonderful book, it engages on multiple levels, so many audiences can enjoy. Rich in symbolism and mythology, Scott has brought legend back to life through this story of unfulfilled destinies.    Nicholas Flamel (alias Nick Fleming) is on the run again. His arch-nemesis has found him and his wife, Perenell, in San Fransisco. But this time he must escape with two teenagers, twins, who were witness to the magical destruction and kidnapping of Perenell. With his immortality hanging in the balance, Nicholas realizes that these twins are foretold in prophecy and it is up to him to find a way to protect them, awaken their magical potential, and train them to defend against the encroaching evil of the Dark Elders.
0060775858|1.0|I bought this for my baby thinking it was a great book since it received so many raving reviews. I was so disappointed when I received it. The artwork is horrible, the story is boring. This is my sons least favorite book. Don't waste your money on this!
0374158460|1.0|Plot Summary: Freedom is bad. if we are free, we will become (and thus have become) a decadent society.    This author propagates that a decadent cycle, which the established media all report on, is because of freedom (deliberately scrambling his message) and thus proposes that freedom is evil.    This is wrong.  Not respecting liberty and freedom and not defending it brings tyranny. Freedom is what made America great. The constitution is what made America great. The fact that this book is being promoted by Oprah and her book club shows the scale of this mind control babble. This is super bad. Avoid this Orwellian thinking and this book like the plague!
B003DKJ5ZU|5.0|I have said it before and I say it now: Tinker Bell is my favorite Disney animated movie series in current times. After watching the two previous installments -- \\"Tinker Bell\\" (2208) and \\"Tinker Bell and the Lost Treasure\\" (2009) -- I was immediately hooked, so, as you can imagine, the third one couldn't be made fast enough for me. And, judging by its popularity, I'm sure I'm not the only one. So it makes me happy to say that the precious and delicious \\"Tinker Bell and the Great Fairy Rescue\\" will also make you very happy.     This third adventure finds Tinker Bell and her friends having fun at Fairy Camp. Everything is going well until, yes, you guessed, Tinker Bell decides to look for trouble, wandering away from the camp. Vidia, another fairy, tries, to no avail, to convince her to return to safety and avoid humans. It turns out that Tinker Bell sees a car from a distance and it captures her attention - she is interested in mechanical objects and how they function and are put together. Eventually, against Vidia's advice, she finds the vehicle parked next to a house, which is inhabited by Lizzy, a little girl, and Dr. Griffiths, her father. It doesn't take long before Tinker Bell gets trapped inside Lizzy's room. Fortunately, the little girl believes in fairies, and they soon become friends. However, Dr. Griffiths is a naturalist, and one of his passions and subject of his research is collecting butterflies. Even though, unlike his daughter, he doesn't believe in fairies, finding one would be a great discovery. In the meanwhile, Tinker Bell's friends plan to rescue her, and by doing so, they will face dangers on the way.    \\"Tinker Bell and the Great Fairy Rescue\\" is tender and truly penetrating, great fun for all the family. These stories champion the values of true love and friendship, and I deeply connected with the scenes between Tinker Bell and Lizzy. I know you will, too - these films are truly addictive. Hopefully we'll have a new adventure in 2011. The delightful Blu-ray + DVD Combo two-disc includes deleted scenes, music videos, and the segments \\"Design a Fairy House\\" and \\"Fairy Field Guide Builder.\\" Released September 21, 2010.

B001HN69AE|1.0|This movie was totally butchered. This movie is not even worth the rating. Unfortunately the movie deviates horribly from the original DB series. Like other reviews head for the hills on this one. The movie is just wrong on so many levels. I mean even Goku's character was completely off-based. What I cannot understand is there is maybe three Japanese people a Japanese film.. Something is wrong here. Why is that? Anyways it do not waste your time and go find real quality movies.
B000VNMMQG|5.0|Amazing Grace is a great movie based on the abolition of the slave trade in Briton the acting is brilliant. It will open your eyes to the horrors of slavery and dedication sacrifice of one man's fight to change the world. I loved the movie when I first saw it that's why I bought the video.
B00003CXBH|4.0|This is a hard-to-watch yet necessary depiction of the destruction caused by invaders in a South American jungle in the 18th century.  The natives were doing just fine, and even the Jesuit priests were not disrupting things too much for them, but then others decided to take over the area and make it their own, forcing out everyone who was already there.    There are some horrifying scenes of people,  including children, being shot and killed.  Also, I question the priest's decision to remain in the  mission with the people facing certain doom  by staying there.    I also am not sure I liked the casting of DeNiro as a European mercenary turned priest.    However, the locations and other performances, as well as the music, make this a compelling film.
B003NFM3JK|5.0|This was one of the best movies I have seen in a long time, but come on, movies usually come out on dvd like maybe five months later, this has taken almost a full year to come out, and i get that they want to sell more by selling it near the holidays, but they came out with Wolfman on dvd, and if memory serves that movie might have come out before this one did, and it still made it on to dvd earlier, so I hate it when they try to pump up the hype, just like with Avatar, they say get avatar for a limited time only, and there are still plenty of avatar dvds around so...i returned my copy of it, without opening it up, I refuse to buy it without behind the scenes and extra stuff...sorry if you don't like this ramble, but anyway, great movie, bummed that I have to wait another 2 and some months for it
B0028KF4ME|1.0|Worse TV show (if you can call it a tv show) in history or the media arts. The acting bad, story terrible, and I really want to fire an ban the director and producers from this kind of work!     Watch Alfred Hitchcocks original Psycho or Halloween if you want a real serial killer/thriller feature.

After about 300 pages of Gardens of the Moon, and reading the reviews on the other books, i went out and purchased the other remaining 8 available books, and will get the 10th when it comes out.

0545310601|1.0|Some of the previous reviews do a great job of describing the major flaws of this third book.  None of the major plot lines or philosophical questions were adequately addressed.  The great question of Peeta or Gale (or even more interestingly, *how* to go about choosing) is laughably \\"resolved\\" like a Disney cartoon -- about that quickly and with about that depth.

B004132HZS|5.0|Like another U.S. reviewer for \\"Sherlock\\" I, too, was able to view this in advance of it being released here. Nearly everything I would say about \\"Sherlock\\" has been said by other reviewers, but I'd like to add that, as a longtime Sherlockian/Watsonian who has read, discussed, re-read, and discussed some more about all of the Holmes stories, there are little winks and nudges to Holmes fans like myself in \\"Sherlock.\\" In \\"A Study in Pink\\" a young man goes back for an umbrella. The news headline tells of a \\"James Phillimore\\" as having been found dead. In the Sherlock Holmes stories there is a character of the same name who is briefly mentioned as having come back to his house for his umbrella and was never seen again. The attention to detail such as that is an example that the creators have a passion for Holmes and Watson, as well as the original stories, and respect for the rest of us who do as well.<br /><br />I belong to several Sherlock Holmes groups and I must say, across the board, no one who has seen this show has any criticisms. This is our Holmes. This is our Watson.
0545310601|4.0|After somehow surviving the Hunger Games twice, Katniss Everdeen's life is in turmoil. Peeta is captured by the Capitol. District 12 is destroyed. War is all across Panem, following the bright, flickering wings of the Mockingjay. Can the rebels rise up and overthrow President Snow and his evil regime?<br /><br />There was no doubt that I would be reading Mockingjay. Suzanne Collins' phenomenal YA series and its remarkable characters are strong and unforgettable and I had to find out how it all ended. And, lamely, I even cared about who Katniss would end up with: Peeta or Gale. Yes, I had my preference.<br /><br />I went into Mockingjay expecting tragedy. I've read enough dystopic literature to know that people would likely die. Heck, I knew not to expect a happy ending. What I expected was for the rebels to overthrow the Capitol and society somehow manage to eke out its existence for another few years.  I expected more brutality, more evil machinations, more social commentary, more tough choices, and more fast-paced action for Katniss.<br /><br />Did the book live up to my expectations? Were my expectations even relevant? I'm not saying. I will say that after finishing the book I had a few minor issues, but I can't see any better way for it all to have ended. There were certain choices that seemed irrational and certain actions that left a bitter taste in my mouth, that's for sure.<br /><br />The story is heavy and brutal. Not as graphic as the previous books (Remember the muttations from Catching Fire? Or the tracker jacker venom dream Katniss had?), Mockingjay still carries a massive weight to the story. It's not an easy read; there's too much dytopia for that, but it is a quick and entertaining read. Still, the mindset for reading is so heavy that reading a lot in one sitting is sometimes taxing.<br /><br />I can't imagine anyone reading this without reading the previous two books, nor would I recommend it. Likewise, I can't imagine anyone not reading this after reading the first two books. If you've invested time in the life of Katniss Everdeen, then Mockingjay is a book you'll read to get closure. I was satisfied with the end, and I think Collins did an amazing job at portraying her world. There's plenty of things to think about on the series as a whole, like our current societies love for reality tv or our never-ending desire to be beautiful. But more than that, there's a teenage girl that goes through unimaginable difficulties and she is a character to remember.<br /><br />Mockingjay is a suitable end to Collins' trilogy.  It has its flaws and certainly doesn't live up to The Hunger Games, but it has enough excitement in it to easily make it worth the read.nvested time in the life of Katniss Everdeen, then Mockingjay is a book you'll read to get closure.

B000S5TKH6|5.0|I couldn't understand what was \\"wrong\\" with me, and no one else could figure it out, either. Noise, light, touch, cold, people's emotions, crowds--I couldn't take it anymore. If I had the money, I would have become a hermit; however I didn't so I thought I would cut down on the constant pounding on my senses by staying alone as much as possible in a warm, quiet home. No man is an island, though, so I became depressed. I was going to just end the pain and somehow I found The Highly Sensitive Person Website. It was about ME!!! I purchased the book (this book!) and found hope. I am not \\"taking things too hard\\" and it's not just \\"mind over matter\\" as people would tell me. I am an HSP and now that I have the coping skills (and now that I know I am not alone) I have hope and peace. This book is a lifesaver.
1582403589|4.0|Dang. As a longtime comic book reader and a lifelong admirer of zombies, I've never read the highly acclaimed The Walking Dead  by Robert Kirkman. Why? Because I've never had the funds to purchase all current volumes and catch up, nor did my library have them shelved. Then, upon hearing about AMCs anticipated series based on the comics, I happened to check my current local library, not really expecting any results. Color me surprised. The library has every trade paperback that's currently out.<br /><br />I immediately checked out Volumes 1-8, and now offer my review of Volume 1, Days Gone Bye.<br /><br />The story begins with Rick, a police officer from Kentucky, and his partner out on patrol. Rick gets shot and goes into a coma. When he wakes up a month later in an abandoned hospital, he's disoriented and confused. And then he sees them. Zombies, decayed and grisly. Terrified, he fleas from the hospital onto a world overrun and destroyed.<br /><br />Days Gone Bye sounds like so many other zombie stories, and in many ways it is. Countless undead roam the world, hungry and devouring anything with meat on it. A ragtag group of survivors try to press on with life despite the fact that nearly everyone they loved is dead and gone. Heck, even some of the characters are stock characters, cliched and familiar. But through it all, Days Gone Bye was still powerful.<br /><br />What makes it so is the drama. Kirkman takes the familiar character and works with it, sculpting something new and exciting. The writing is solid. Dialog flows smoothly. Each character is unique and Kirkman gives life and light to all. They have their own voice, and I found most of them very believable.<br /><br />With each turn of the page the tension grows. The dichotomy is beautiful. On one hand you've got a populated world of undead, flesh-hungry monsters lurking always off the page, threatening the safety of the group. On the other, you've got the mounting squabbles and secrets of the survivors. When I finished Volume 1, I literally exclaimed, \\"Wow.\\" The thing definitely packed a punch. Thankfully I already have Volume 2 at my disposal.<br /><br />In addition to the fine story telling, the illustrations (by Tony Moore) fit the plot nicely. The whole thing has a retro feel to it, being done in simple blacks & whites. The lack of color makes things gloomier. Spookier. Plus, the drawings of the zombies were just cool.<br /><br />The Walking Dead is something I'm looking forward to getting into. If the rest of the series is as good as Days Gone Bye, then I see a bright, albeit dim and bloody, road ahead of me. I easily recommend this book to anyone interested in zombies, intense drama, good-undead fun, or post-apocalyptic scenarios. It was a quick, enjoyable read that left me hungry for more.imed, \\"Wow.\\" The thing definitely packed a punch. Thankfully I already have Volume 2 at my disposal.

B00004YX39|4.0|Where do two of the best writers, using the best musicians, go after [[ASIN:B00003002C Aja]]? If you are Steely Dan, you just keep shining the pearl<br /><br />And the pearl becomes more shaded, more subtle. Nothing on Gaucho is going to jump out like \\"Riki Don't Lose That Number\\" from [[ASIN:B00000IPAC Pretzel Logic]] or any of the brash jazz-funk of [[ASIN:B00003002D The Royal Scam]], or the art rock of Aja.<br /><br />Gaucho was 1980, when digital recording was just becoming viable. Technology was always as important to Steely Dan as a drum or guitar or bass--another instrument. Here, they used cutting edge recording to make an album that was mainly about musical subtlety.<br /><br />\\"Babylon Sisters\\" creeps slowly out of the gate to open Gaucho. It is one of Steely Dan's most quiet numbers. And if you hear the albums in order, it is off-putting. It is only after you let this work you, play it a few times that the horns seep in. As does Chuck Rainy's amazing bass. Texture on texture moving like glaciers.<br /><br />\\"Hey Nineteen\\" was the hit. A track you even hear now on soft-pop stations. Ok. Whatever the genre bean counters want to play; if they want to play one of the best bands ever in rock, I am not going to argue. Play \\"Hey Nineteen,\\" against Luther Vandross, 1980s  Carly Simon, any soft rock or adult contemporary, whatever the hell the bean counterheads want to call it,  and there is no comparison.<br /><br />The rest of this album follows suite. Steely Dan had definitely not sold out: the music on Gaucho is as complex and nuanced as any of their work.<br /><br />I can't decide, though, if the more soft tones here were the tones of Steely Dan having painted themselves into a corner. By 1980 the type of rock experimentalism that the band helped define was winding down, and that edge was about to fall right into a swamp  called MTV. Certainly if Becker and Fagen had wanted they could have been the worlds best soft rock band or gone completely jazz.<br /><br />Ironically the kind of audio the duo had always been striving for was just becoming a technological reality in 1980. Was the challenge gone? Anyone's guess.<br /><br />It doesn't matter, as it took Dan twenty years to recharge and arrived with 1970s sophistication for the digital age, on 2000s [[ASIN:B00004GOXS Two Against Nature]]--an album for rock as a downloading free for all when bands can work as little or as much as they want: there really is no such beast as an album anymore.

B003TXSF5C|2.0|A good rule of thumb for determining whether something can be considered science is: Does it ask the question of HOW or WHY?  A question of how is in the realm of science, and why is in the realm of theology/philosophy.  To give a scientific answer, the question must be testable AND falsifiable.      The book opened with a statement that philosophy is dead.  The author (either hawking or this other guy) wants to make a statement that philosophy is dead because science surpassed it.  The truth to this statement is simply that science and philosophy began as the same discipline, but branched from each other centuries ago.  To compare science and philosophy is truely like comparing apples and oranges - they answer different types of questions.      The book then goes into describing modern physics, special and general relativity, quantum mechanics, string theory, and M theory.  The descriptions of these subdisciplines of physics are OK at best.  The authors barely tackle the surface of these topics (and if that is a reason you picked this book to read, you will be sadly disappointed).      The book concludes with a chapter attempting to answer the question WHY.  Again, this is not a question science can answer.  Science surely can answer HOW (or WHAT).  I mention this because the book's concluding chapter attempts to relate an artificial universe with our own.  The authors describes an experiment that, when set with initial conditions, will evolve on its own.  They then attempt to tie that scenario with our real universe, and explain how a universe is created from nothing.  Authorship seems to have vanished midway through the final chapter.  As one reads the end, it seems that the author hurried up to finish the book, but had more to say.  This is probably true due to a publisher deadline, but that is simply speculation.  The result though is unconvincing evidence for the author's argument.  They spend whole chapters on relativity and quantum mechanics, with plenty oftime to discuss energy budgets, but develop conclusions based on things that were not talked about through the rest of the book.  The last few paragraphs seem to be pulled from thin air, not ideas developed through the rest of the book.        The biggest problem with this is that although they come up with their answer of HOW, they try to equate that to answer WHY.  They describe HOW the universe can come from nothing, but equate that to being WHY the universe exists.  This may sound like i'm just being picky to the average american, but there is a BIG fundamental difference between these words to someone trained in science.  HOW and WHY are not the same.      Overall the book was a big dissappointment.  I began reading it because of the media hype behind it.  Yahoo! news and other sources reported things like \\"Hawking changes view on God\\" and made statements indicating that he had rejected religion and I wanted to find out what he actually said about religion and God.  Reading the book in that context, I did not find a definitive statement regarding the absence of God as the media claimed the book stated.  Instead, Hawking's argument is simply that God is not a reqirement in science to determine how the universe was made.  These two things are drastically different as well, but i'm sure the media does not feel that way (the media is only there to sell news anyways, media outlets like CNN are businesses and must make money somehow).  To say that one can use science to explain the existence of the universe without resorting to statements such as \\"first- God said _________\\" is NOT the same thing as saying there is no God.  This is a similar mistake made by Richard Dawkins and his foolish quest to rid America of religion.  The science may be good, but God is not something that is testable anyways.  We can explain things in the Universe and on Earth because science allows us to see patterns and make predictions, but whether God exists is outside of the realm of science.      Finally, if you wish to read this book simply for a brush up on modern physics, I recommend two other books (below).  These books are well written and go into detail about modern physics in a way that someone not well trained in science can understand.

B00442SNAE|5.0|I loved the first two years of Chuck but hated much of year 3 - last year. I never even watched all of the episodes of year 3 even though I previously bought them all on demand. I started each one but lost interest in perhaps half of them which weren't funny.<br /><br />During the third year, we happened to have three sets of house guests (we have a lot of guests because we live in a resort) whom we had turned on to Chuck during year 2. Each of the three couples independently complained that it wasn't funny, sweet or entertaining any more! I'm afraid the producers  have damaged the brand significantly with the poor plots and writing of year three! My friends for example, liked the early shows but probably won't watch again.<br /><br />As I said, I think 4.1 was good and promising. However if they bring back Superman one more time (even in a dream) I'm through for good!
0439023513|4.0|Yes, I do question how much of modern teen literature is really for teens. I enjoyed the trilogy but except for the lack of sex scenes, it is just as much for adults. Other series' such as Twighlight, and Everlost are pushing the envelope where Artimis Fowl and Percy Jackson take the more traditional route.    That said, Mockingjay does not deserve the negative reviews it has received. It is a well written and I feel, fulfilling conclusion to the series. The story shares the angst of anyone who has survived war while attempting to hold on to the last shred of humanity. Many books for adults have been written on this subject and I acknowledge that Mockingjay does a good job of representing the moral dilema of \\"Survivor Guilt\\" to a younger audience.    How would we react to having to admit that the evil we have participated in can only be brought down by committing additional evil? Honest readers will share the same concerns as Katniss.     I do not feel this is an anti-war novel as much as it is a novel that recognizes in war, we all make moral choices that darken our soul. At the conclusion of the novel, she (we) are faced with a final moral dilema. She (we) make the choice that in the end, returns a bit of light to our soul.    By all means, if you have read the other two books, read this one. As for which boy she chooses to love in the end, Gale or Peeta . . . read the book and find out. You will find that to be agreeable as well.
B002VPE1XE|3.0|The universal camera case is essentially a functional generic camera case.  Among its pros - it is roomy and will hold a larger digital camera or small videorecorder. It also has a zipper pocket on the front that is large enough to hold batteries and a memory card and this pocket is covered by the flap.  The cons for this camera case include that is fastens with velcro and the velcro is a rectangle at the base of the case, so the flip-over flap tends to \\"pop\\" or \\"bellow out\\" and can get caught on things. The case has a wrist strap but no over-the-shoulder strap and it is basic black with mediocre craftsmanship.  It is the sort of case you overlook, or buy if it is the right fit or will be better than nothing, but it isn't a case that jumps off the shelf to grab your attention.
0061537934|3.0|No need to review the storyline, as others have done that in their reviews.  I only aim to inform as to why the 3 star rating.    While I enjoyed this book because it is written from the perspective of a dog, I found it too predictable.  I can see it being turned into a movie for all those who want to read this book but find sitting in a theater more suitable to them.  If you only spend a minimal time reading, do not waste your time on this book.  If you are an avid reader looking for a quick, easy read, save the money and pick it up at your local library.

B003D83DPA|2.0|The picture quality is terrible. I know it's old footage but, Queen Rock Montreal was recorded 2 years prior and the picture quality is amazing. Don't bother with this bluray because it looks like vhs quality transfered to a disc. Sounds good though.
B00003JRCQ|2.0|Of all the movies based on Jane Austen's novels, this story seems somewhat frustrating in the slow plot.  There is the usual romance, set in 1814 England, and the cinematography, costumes and scenes are beautiful.  It is a story of Anne Elliot (Amanda Root) who is the spinster daughter of a aristocratic family having money issues.  The father has been widowed and spends far too much money, so the family have to rent the estate and move to smaller quarters.<br /><br />It turns out Anne was once engaged to Frederic Wentworth, who was deemed too beneath her by family.  She had to break her engagement eight years prior.  He was a young sea captain at the time, but now, after eight years, he has made a fortune and become successful.  All the young ladies want his attention and company.  Due to the change in her family's fortune, Anne is thrown again into company of Frederic, and there are some indications that he is still  in love with her.  The movie has many facial close-ups and much of the acting is quiet emoting.  There is some humor and irony in the story, but it moves far too slowly and the plot is not that strong.  The period is captured and somewhat educational as it mentions Napoleon isolated on the isle of Elba and a war that is brewing.<br /><br />Overall this is not as good as the other Jane Austen stories, plus the movie has a few audio problems in the first few scenes.  You can surmise what people are saying but many words are hard to hear.

030758660X|5.0|How can anyone who loves fiber and knitting, pass up this book?  You don't have to be a fan of Twilight or vampires to appreciate the fun and wonderful patterns in this book.  It is laid out, printed, photographed, and edited beautifully!  I don't even knit, but I HAD to have it!  I'm hoping that the author/knitter will continue on with other books and patterns . . . these don't go out of style.  Every craft needs some refreshing fun elements to it, and this book is fantastic.  If all the Twighlight fans knew about it, it would not stay in print--so I am going to purchase a couple more now before it becomes out of print and one has to try to find a copy at auction.  Amazon rocks again for having this book!

B000001EGA|4.0|I have the remastered version released in 1995 which features three bonus tracks.  This album was released in 1975, just when Elton John was at the peak of superstardom.  During this time, there was nothing Elton could do wrong.<br /><br />The hit single from this album was \\"Someone Saved My Life Tonight\\", which was apparently the only Top 40 single from the album.  It reached #4 on the Billboard charts.  But, that doesn't mean that there wasn't anything more that was worthy of another single that could have been released.  The album itself was at the Top of the album charts for seven weeks; it was one of the Top 10 albums for 1975 for what seemed like forever.  The FM station that I enjoyed listening to in Detroit played other tracks from this album.  The radio favorites were \\"Tower of Babel\\", \\"Tell Me When The Whistle Blows\\", and \\"Writing.\\"  My personal favorites from this album were \\"Better Off Dead\\" and \\"We All Fall in Love Sometimes/Curtains.\\"<br /><br />Yes, this album alone was probably the last great Elton John album (with a cool colorful cover), because after this album he released \\"Rock of The Westies,\\" which really wasn't all that great even though his hit \\"Island Girl\\" went to #1.  I just didn't care for that album, so Elton John started to become less of an interest to me from that release forward.<br /><br />Now, this 1995 release of \\"Captain Fantastic\\" has three great bonus tracks, which include the two #1 singles of \\"Lucy in The Sky With Diamonds\\" and \\"Philadelphia Freedom.\\" How's that for making a great album even better?  Plus, a B-side single \\"One Day at a Time\\" (which was also done by John Lennon).  Although, I enjoyed many of Elton John's singles over the next 20 plus years, my Elton John album collection ended with \\"Captain Fantastic.\\"

Seeing from a different angle always makes your vission clearer. I savor every work that Diana produces. Thankyou for the trips you take us on.
B000001DQG|5.0|I know that it had to be hard for Elton John to top the success of his previous album \\"Goodbye Yellow Brick Road,\\" but he and Bernie Taupin didn't just give up. This album had the Top 40 singles of \\"The Bitch is Back\\" and \\"Don't Let The Sun Go Down on Me.\\"  I didn't care too much for \\"The Bitch is Back\\" (which is just about as unpleasing as \\"Grow Some Funk of Your Own\\" from \\"Rock of the Westies.\\")  Anyway, there are some fabulous non-hits all over this album, in fact, I believe that \\"The Bitch is Back\\" is the worst track of the album, which probably explains why I never bought the album back in 1974.  On FM radio in Detroit, they did play \\"You're So Static\\", and \\"I've Seen the Saucers\\" which were fine, but wasn't enough to coerce me into buying the album of \\"Caribou.\\"  I bought this CD in 1995 when I was starting to build an Elton John CD collection which I took advantage of BMG's \\"buy one at regular price, get four for free\\" which was an entire Elton John quick grow collection for me.<br /><br />I had no idea how wonderful this album truly is!  From \\"Pinky\\" to \\"Ticking,\\" every track on here is truly amazing.  And to top it off, this CD release has four bonus tracks which included the movie Tommy's \\"Pinball Wizard\\", and three other fairly decent bonus tracks including his Christmas release of \\"Step Into Christmas.\\"  I guess, if it had a more interesting album cover (like \\"Goodbye Yellow Brick Road\\", and \\"Captain Fantastic and the Brown Dirt Cowboy\\") then maybe it would have gotten more attention.  I don't know.<br /><br />Next to \\"Goodbye Yellow Brick Road\\" and \\"Madman Across the Water\\", \\"Caribou\\" is my third favorite Elton John CD.

B003XQRZ7E|3.0|I heard someone say \\"This is the kind of classic rock album that makes great albums by the Rolling Stones, Montrose, The Allman Brothers, Deep Purple, Led Zeppelin, Black Sabbath, worth re-discovering. \\"<br /><br />Well, I'm not sure about that, but it reminds you why great albums by the Roiling Stones, Montrose, The Allman Brothers, Deep Purple, Led Zeppelin, Black Sabbath are classics and worth rediscovering if you haven't dug them out for a while.<br /><br />I was so looking forward to this, yet first play was so underwhelming. I put this down to having an ear infection which had dulled my hearing, but that's now worn off and it still sounds the same, it's just so mundane and uninspiring. I can't find fault in Joe B's guitar playing, but apart from \\"One Last Soul\\" nothing is sticking in my memory.<br /><br />Why Glenn Hughes is dubbed \\"The Voice of Rock\\" is beyond me, as he has always sounded like a cat with a firework up its fundament, but wasn't it the KLF that dubbed him that, what do they know?<br /><br />I see lots of refernces to Jason Bonham's drumming being akin to that of his father, well all I can suggest is that Mrs Bonham must have been carrying on with Les Binks whilst Bonzo was out on tour. I've heard more oomph from carboard boxes!<br /><br />My biggest bugbear though, is the criminal underused of Derek Sherinian. After he left Dream Theater they spiralled into mediocrity, but the only part of his I can recall is the totally incongruous Kashmiresque Middle-eastern bit in \\"no Time\\" which is exactly sort of thing his replacement in Dream Theater does to ruin them (OK so Jordan Rudess has interjections of rinky-dink/saloon bar piano in DT songs, but you get the drift)<br /><br />Maybe, just maybe, it's a grower, so I'll give it three stars on the offchance it improves. In the meantime I'm off to play Joe B's \\"A New Day Yesterday\\".<br /><br />Can I also suggest that people check out the Spiritual Beggars latest \\"Return to Zero\\" for a slab of retro 70's style Classic Rock.
0345505387|4.0|While I was not terribly familiar with graphic novels, I loved comic books well into my teens, and looked forward to The Exile. I, for one, am not disappointed. Given the constraints of the format I thought it was enjoyable -- and I loved the way Jamie and Claire were depicted by the artist. Someone wrote that Jamie looked too young and naive, seeming to forget that he was only 22 and still a virgin when he married Claire. I do agree that in some of the panels his looks changed somewhat, but usually due , IMO, to the artist attempting to convey emotion. Real people do not look the same all the time -- sometimes we look great and other times pretty darn unattractive (and I have the pictures to prove it!). The beautiful images of Claire succeeded in wiping away that horrible illustation that appeared on the cover of the first mass market edition to be released in the U.S. back in the early 90s -- the one where Claire looked like a middle aged washerwoman.<br /><br />Now to the negatives: I agree that the color of Jamie's eyes didn't seem quite right, they looked too dark (Gabaldon wrote that his eyes were dark blue, but in the book they looked almost black); and the story of  Kenneth was unnecessary and confusing. One of the problems with a graphic novel is that wonderful pieces of discriptive passages, with which Outlander abounds, are eliminated by the format. But I feel that Hoang Nguyen's beautiful illustrations of Scotland in many ways compensated for the lack of narration. I would like to see more of this format.
B003VQM2M4|5.0|The second album from Grinderman is easily the best record of 2010. I can't see anything coming out in the next 4 months being better than this. Don't think this album is all Nick Cave, the other members of Grinderman all shine just as bright. Warren Ellis is a mad-man genius with whatever instrument he picks up. Bad Seed veterens Martyn Casey and Jim Sclavunos round out the band, and they get plenty of room to let loose, particularly on the closing jam of \\"When My Baby Comes\\"  If you are at all interested in \\"different\\" music or just looking for something fresh, I guarantee you have never heard music like this before.    Favorite Tracks:\\"Heathen Child\\" \\"When My Baby Comes\\" \\"Kitchenette\\" and Palaces of Montezuma\\".    Hank.

B002ZRPQ5K|4.0|Having read all the negative reviews for this album, I avoided purchasing it, fearing that Keane had veered too deeply into their 80's pop explorations. But I purchased it on a whim because even a bad Keane album could have one amazing track with their trademark sound to make it worth it.    Sure enough, the album does have 1 or 2 solid Keane-style songs, and after you listen to it a few times and adjust to the different styles, even a few of the \\"untraditional\\" tracks become pretty catchy. Yes, some of the songs, especially the ones featuring K'Naan, are terrible, but if you're a Keane fan, I don't think you will be disappointed at all. Tom Chaplin's voice pushes everything forward and binds it all together.    Best tracks:  My Shadow - old school keane goodness  Your Love - Keane channels their inner 80's synth pop with some success  Clear Skies - interesting new direction with some folksy hand clapping.    Ok:  Back in Time - Hints of their Iron Sea album.  Looking Back - Too similar to the Rocky Theme, but it's got a catchy hook.    Failed expiments:  Stop for a Minute - This would be a fantastic track if they cut the entire K'Naan rapping part.   Ishin Denshin - Let's pretend this track didn't happen.
B001KVAMM4|5.0|Is it a coincidence, or is there a mystical reason why the finest recordings of Mendelssohn's perfect and popular Violin Concerto are all performed by soloists whose last names begin with M?  They are: Mutter, Mellova, Menuhin, and Milstein, two women and two men.  This recording by Anne-Sophie Mutter is a special one, since it celebrates the 200th anniversary of the composer's birth. Along with a performance of warmth and classic poise, we get a DVD plus CD package, which is a special gift. The DVD sound is excellent and detailed with perfect color balance. Along with the Concerto, we are given two excellent performances of a rarity and a chestnut. The Violin Sonata, edited by Menuhin, is a welcome entry into the catalogue, and is well played by the husband and wife team of Andre Previn on piano and Anne-Sophie, who convince us that this work should be in the repertoire. The D Minor Trio is equally well played, both recorded in a sumptuous Vienniese venue. The Concerto is done in Leipzig.    An added bonus is a short documentary which seems a bit too brief, but perhaps that's just because we want more of such excellence we see here. Dear DG, Please give us more of such anniversary celebrations. Schumann and Chopin are the current birthdays of note.

B003ODL004|5.0|I've been thinking about this music ever since I saw the movie.  I went to see the film again, in part, to get a better grasp on the complexities of the plot, but in large part to hear the score again, to see if I liked it as much as I imagined.  I finally got my hands on the CD and I've been listening to it over and over again.  I particularly wanted to hear \\"Dream Is Collapsing\\" but I like most, if not all of the tracks almost as much.  It's very atmospheric.  At the library where I work, the elevator mechanism is quite loud and I didn't realize how much Zimmer has captured the actual sound of an elevator until I heard our elevator grinding into action each day. Listening to the score really brings to movie back to mind. If the Academy voters are as haunted by this music as I am, I predict an Oscar for Zimmer this year.

B000W4D94I|5.0|This movie Twister, is a theatrical work of art.  I just love this movie and can watch it over and over again.  There are not other movies I have that I can say this about.  Helen Hunt and Bill Paxton's interaction in this movie is just fantastic.  Although this is another one of the DISASTER MOVIES, it also brings with it a very smart and suddle undertone of sense of humor.  I believe the verse \\"WE HAVE COWS\\" says it all.  Great show, cleverly written and presented in such a way that your not sitting there thinking good lord its another disaster movie.  The effects are wonderful on both versions, but they truely shine in the blue ray format. Sometimes when you buy blue ray, you think what a waste of money it doesnt look any different than the regular version.  This is not so with this blue ray movie, it really shines with this format and well worth the money to buy the blue ray version.
006056251X|5.0|This book was great. I love Sebastian the hero in the book. There is something totally sexy about a bad boy who is sweet but doesn't want people to see that he is. Some of the things he says in the beginning of the book is hilarious. One of my favorite part is when they go to gretna green to get married and the man that suppose to married them tells Sebastian he doesn't like him and Sebastian says that his bride doesn't like him either but that's not stopping her from marrying him. I love the pairing of Evie and Sebastian. He's such a bad boy and she's such a sweet quiet girl. I like that they didn't first instantly become attracted to each other. I hate books where just one look and they were either in love or in lust. Sebastian's feelings for Evie grew gradually without him even realizing it. I love how protective and jealous he became once he was married to Evie. I think Sebastian is one of my ultimate favorite heroes of all time.

I got suckered into the Wheel of Time around the time of book 2, and it has been a long wait to see the end (which we won't for a couple of years).  Well last week I had needed something to read so I ordered \\"The Way of Kings\\" from Amazon.  Two days later is was on my doorstep (love me some Prime).  I started reading it and WOW!!!  Excellent book.  I had trouble going to sleep each night because I didn't want to put it down.  If the rest of this series is as good as this first book, it will occupy the top shelf of my bookshelf beside the Wheel of Time.  If you haven't picked up this book, you need to do so now.
B00005JKN9|2.0|It is tempting to think of New York as it existed between 1800 and 1900 as awash with Victorian elegance--but that was true for only a lucky few, and while there was indeed a growing middleclass, much of the city was little more than a cesspool of corrupt politics and vicious mobs that robbed and killed at will.  These gangs were documented by journalist Herbert Asbury.  His 1926 book was titled THE GANGS OF NEW YORK, and it painted a searing portait of the Five Points district, the numerous gangs, Tamanny Hall, and most particularly the Draft Riots of 1863.  The book eventually attracted the attention of one America's most celebrated filmmakers: Martin Scorsese, who was determined to make a film out of it and who failed miserably at it.<br /><br />There are actually a few positive things about GANGS OF NEW YORK.  The first is that it isn't quite as bad as MANOS, HANDS OF FATE.  (Then again, nothing is.)  That aside, the design side of the film is brilliant; the designers involved have created a vision of New York that has never really been attempted, much less realized.  The sets, the costumes, the props, every detail is meticulously rendered.  But sad to say, the rest of the movie stinks.  Although Daniel Day-Lewis' performance as Bill the Butcher has many fans, it really isn't much more than characture.  Leonardo DiCaprio is consistently mediocre and Cameron Diaz is relentlessly miscast.  The script is uninspired--and sad to say the story is too, a ridiculous melodrama about a mere lad (DiCaprio, eventually) who sees his father (Liam Neeson) killed by Bill the Butcher (Day-Lewis.)  Now grown up, he returns and seeks revenge.  It's all very ho-hum stuff, and particularly so when you stop to consider the book that suggested the film.  It contains hundreds of characters and stories.  This made-up plot was the best they could do?  With a run time well over two hours the whole thing feels interminable, and sad to say the bonus material on the second disk is considerably more interesting than the film itself.<br /><br />Scorsese fans, people with a fondness for the leading actors, and those who truly have nothing better to do will likely enjoy GANGS OF NEW YORK, but I find it a tremendous disappointment and I think most people will too.  Miss it.<br /><br />GFT, Amazon Reviewerinteresting than the film itself.

0674049160|5.0|Just when I thought I had more editions of PRIDE AND PREJUDICE  than I should ever own up to, I will freely admit to just one more. After all, what Janeite could resist this tempting package? An unabridged first edition text; Annotations by an Austen scholar; Color illustrations; Over-sized coffee table format; Extensive introduction; And, supplemental material - all pulled together in a beautifully designed interior and stunning cover. *swoon* Where are my aromatic vinegars?<br /><br />This new annotated edition appeals to modern readers on many levels beyond being a pretty package of a beloved classic. Austen is renowned for her witty dialogue and finely drawn characters, but not for her elaborate physical descriptions or historical context. When PRIDE AND PREJUDICE was originally published in 1813, this brevity was accessible to her contemporary readers who assumed the inferences, but after close to two hundred years words have changed their meaning, insinuations and subtle asides have become fuzzy, and cultural differences from Regency to twenty-first century are worlds apart. Anyone can read PRIDE AND PREJUDICE and follow the narrative, but it is so much more enjoyable if you can read it on an expanded level understanding it in social, cultural and historical context. Editor Patricia Meyer Spacks has not only added extensive notes on plot, characters, events, history, culture and critical analysis from a vast array of Austen and literary scholars, but added her own personal insights and observations from years of reading Austen and her experience as a college professor. From shoe roses to Fordyces Sermons to military floggings to the 19th-century meaning of condescension, readers will be informed and enlightened on every aspect related to the novel, the author and her times. In a nut shell, she has vetted great resources, gathered nuggets of knowledge and placed them at our feet.<br /><br />As with all of Austen's characters, this new annotated edition of PRIDE AND PREJUDICE has its own charms, \\"frailties, foibles and follies.\\" Weighing in at over three pounds, and encompassing 464 pages of unabridged text and fine print margin notes, this book easily reigns as the most all-inclusive and well-researched edition of Jane Austen's masterpiece that I have ever encountered. Considering that the elaborate annotation classifies it as a reference work in addition to a full text, it is quite puzzling that it lacks an index. In addition, the illustrations are expertly selected but sadly lost some of their refinement in the printing process, coming across dark and murky in places. However, I was pleased to see a list of further reading and illustration credits listed in the back of the book to encourage readers to \\"add something more substantial, in the improvement of [their] minds by extensive reading.\\"<br /><br />Beautiful, sumptuous and satisfying, PRIDE AND PREJUDICE: AN ANNOTATED EDITION is a monumental achievement that should be on the top of your holiday wish list and considered one of few editions available to be esteemed truly accomplished.<br /><br />Laurel Ann, AustenproseAND PREJUDICE has its own charms, \\"frailties, foibles and follies.\\" Weighing in at over three pounds, and encompassing 464 pages of unabridged text and fine print margin notes, this book easily reigns as the most all-inclusive and well-researched edition of Jane Austen's masterpiece that I have ever encountered.

B002KEDQJQ|3.0|There is a lot of Superhero action in this movie. The who-dun-it aspect is simple to figure out. What really bogs the movie down is the stiff acting by everyone and the ever constant heavy themes of blurring good and evil. I ask you, can the Watchmen really be good guys if they allow Nixon to become president 5 terms and disco music to survive?<br /><br />The movie does a poor job of introducing the characters. You are fed a pseudo history of the US with Watchmen during the opening credits. Once Bob Dylan is done playing, the movie starts and you are confused who the characters are. The relationship of the characters and their past deeds are relayed through flashback scenes, which in many cases were more interesting than the rest of the movie. The lack of character introduction wasn't as bad as &#34;Final Fantasy VII&#34; movie, but it is worse than what Tolkien did to us.<br /><br />The Superheros, a vigilante group who murder women and children for their country (an early good/evil blur) are semi-retired as wearing masks became outlawed. Someone is killing off the Superheros and superhero Rorschach is the most determined to find out.<br /><br />Dr. Manhattan (big blue guy, clothes optional)can't see into his future and has assumed we have annihilated each other. Meanwhile, Nixon and Kissinger are in the war room, in a scene which reminds us of Dr. Strangelove. They are debating a first strike.<br /><br />If you like your superhero action mixed in with pseudo history, political statements, blurred good/evil themes/ atheist statements (The watch has no watch maker), and the slinky Silk Spectre being zipped out of her costume (some nudity) then this movie is for you.<br /><br />If you like good acting, a well written chronological story, good dialogue, and a need to know the characters, and film editors past the third grade- go elsewhere.
B002ZG9940|4.0|THE AMERICAN<br /><br />STARRING: George Clooney, Paolo Bonacelli  Violante Placido and Irina Bj&ouml;rklund<br /><br />WRITTEN BY: Rowan Joffe; based on the novel by Martin Booth<br /><br />DIRECTED BY: Anton Corbijn<br /><br />Rated: R<br />Genre: Drama / Thriller<br />Release Date: 01 September 2010<br />Review Date: 07 September 2010<br /><br />The first thing you need to know about The American, is that it's probably not going to be what you expect. The daunting music and fast editing we see in the trailer is nothing more than typical Hollywood marketing propaganda. Add to that, the `cool movie trailer voice guy' on the radio advertisements describing George Clooney's character as `an assassin who lived in the shadows' and an audio clip of Clooney shouting `Who's side are you on?!' - and you're sitting in a bathtub of lies and disappointment. That line of dialogue was definitely voiced by Clooney, but never appears in this film.  All these things mentioned, are not to imply that I didn't enjoy the film.<br /><br />To call The American an action film would be to call The Bourne Identity a comedy. It's a drama with a gentle nod in the direction of being a thriller. It's an artsy film; long drawn out sequences of following the central character around doing normal everyday things like working out, driving, and walking down the street. There is little to no music in tow and very lean dialogue throughout. There - now you can stop reading and go see The Expendables if this isn't what you're looking forward to. Big Clooney fan like myself? Good - keep reading.<br /><br />George Clooney stars as, you guessed it - `the American', complete with all the glory of the most American of American names, particularly on the silver screen; Jack. Jack is an assassin who has grown weary of the lifestyle. The film opens with him on holiday with his Swedish lover. I won't reveal what happens, but I will tell you that it ignites the entire momentum of the film, and is the first of several unanswered questions the movie fails to provide. The one I'm talking about here being, why did he handle the situation in Sweden the way that he did? He expresses later that `she had nothing to do with it.' So why then? Who knows though; others may not have as many questions as I did.<br /><br />Because of the event in Sweden, Jack takes shelter in Italy. Why Italy? I don't know. Once there however, he is offered a new job by his employer, over the phone. It's clear from the get-go that Jack is trained in combat and is a skilled marksman. But the only proof he was an assassin comes from his boss telling him there is a mark and that he won't have to pull the trigger this time. Jack accepts the job.<br /><br />What is the job if he is not to kill this time around?; to construct the ultimate rifle for a client to do the killing herself. She wants a rifle with the power of a machine gun, but that can be silenced as much as possible. The scenes showing how Jack constructs this device were among some of my favorites.<br /><br />Jack forms two important relationships. One is with a woman named Clara (Violante Placido) who is a prostitute, and the second is a Catholic Priest. A rare combination of company to keep, I know.<br /><br />The relationship with the girl becomes a romance and is handled perfectly by both actors and the filmmakers. They deliver the hottest love scene of the year, as well as extraordinarily well acted scenes, often without dialogue being exchanged.<br /><br />At least from what I could tell, the priest is merely in the film for us to learn more about Jack's character. We do so by way of secondhand subtext found in the Father confessing the sins of his past to Jack, while Jack stays quiet - no doubt having dabbled in the same muck. Oh yeah, the priest is also there so that Clooney can look at the camera in an extreme close-up and deliver the gnarly one-liner, \\"I don't think God's very interested in me, Father.\\"<br /><br />There are way too manythings that are left unexplained; such as why there are men after Jack, wanting him dead, and why jack became an assassin in the first place. He claims, \\"Everything I've done, I've had good cause to do.\\" But I hardly buy that he honestly believes that.<br /><br />Also, why did he not make a move on the woman he is sculpting the weapon for? She was clearly interested and he was constantly checking her out and his relationship with Clara had not yet blossomed. The only thing I have is maybe he doesn't mix business with pleasure? But then why the temptation in the story? We needed more answers. And what was the deal with the butterflies? I get the parallel, but what was Jack's fascination with them? I have one theory, but I'll leave that one for you to figure out.<br /><br />The thing The American has that most other films in theaters right now lack, is amazing cinematography; definitely some of the best I have seen this year. The camera tells the story. There are some really terrific shots and we are constantly following Jack through blind cornered alleys in the elegant Italian villas and the camera gives us the sense that there is someone lurking around every corner; and every so often someone is. Most films use music to give these scares away to us prematurely, while The American holds you in silence until we jump when Clooney's character does; that's good cinema.k became an assassin in the first place.

0792839730|4.0|I have not read the book and watched the movie without any other preparation. The results was an interesting big scale movie with a cast of well-know names but sometimes hard to follow. There may have been simply too much to try and communicate from the book but the results sometimes left me confused as to who was doing what to whom.<br /><br />Individual scenes could be touching and powerful as one would expect from such a stellar roster of stars but the overall effect left something to be desired. My wife is very interested in WW II and has read much on the various battles and even she said she was confused sometime by the movie.<br /><br />I think we're both glad we watched it but will not be seeking it out again anytime soon. I would suggest reading the book first, or at least renting the movie before you buy so you can see what you think.
B003DZX44I|5.0|In my opinion, Disney's Beauty and the Beast is the pinnacle of the Eisner animation era.  The hand-drawn animation is stunning, the music is captivating, and the characters are superb.  It's amazing how many great movies came out of that era and I believe this was the best.
B00003CWPL|5.0|This is a remarkable film that does have a plot. I am not going to write a spoiler here but trust me that there is a definate story and it does make sense. When you watch this film keep in mind the situation that Henry is in and the intense anxiety that he must be going through. For Henry Spencer, this is a real life nightmare. Look for the points where he is attempting to cope with his anxiety and try to recognize his coping techniques, especially toward the end. This film is a puzzle and once solved I can guess that you will have the same eureka moment that I had. There are definate points in the film that are still unclear to me but the general story is well told. If Lynch isn't a creative genius then I guess I don't know what one is.
B001993Y0Y|5.0|This is such an incredible movie. One of Ridley Scott's best and so criminally overlooked.<br /><br />I can't understand the other reviewer's comments of it being \\"too gory\\".  It's not gory at all.  I wouldn't even call it violent by today's standards.  It just presents an unflinching view at the friction between the indians and the Spaniards.  If anything, it's downplayed quite a bit.  There is one scene where an indian gets his hand hacked off for stealing.  Gruesome realism to be sure, but hardly the splatter-fest that was implied in a previous review.<br /><br />And leave Gerard Depardieu alone!  He is excellent as Columbus and yes, I can understand everything he says without subtitles.  The supporting cast is superb too: Armand Assante, Sigourney Weaver, Frank Langella, Tchecky Karyo and Kevin Dunn.  This is simply a gorgeous film. Maybe not completely historically accurate but so what?  Few films if any are.  And Vangelis turns in one of his finest film scores to date.<br /><br />I've been waiting for eons for a decent studio issue DVD of this film, now I'm just waiting for Paramount to get off their asses' and release it on blu ray. This would look absolutely amazing in HD if they handled the transfer well. I'm hoping that Ridley Scott revisits this one and personally oversees a supreme frame-by-frame digital transfer into HD.  Come on, guys! We've been waiting long enough!
B00433FQKO|5.0|I learned about this record because I'm a big JB fan and boy and I glad that this band has put out a record.  It's simply one of the best hard rock records that I've heard in a good while.  I hate to admit it, but I wasn't all that familiar with the singer/bass player Glenn Hughes but man can this guy wail.  After listening to this record a few times, I can see how this guy simply must have had a great influence on singers like Chris Cornell, only Glenn is doing it way better than Chris these days that's for sure.  Let's certainly not forget that Jason Bonham is on drums here as well as Derek Sherinian on keys.  Needless to say, these guys are professionals and have a very nice chemistry.  If I didn't know better I would swear these guys have been playing together for years and maybe they have behind closed doors for all I know.    Each one of these songs will make an impact.  I just hope that they're going to do a little touring to support this group so that they will give us more in the future.
0143038583|5.0|Great book.  It will change the way you think, and, if you let it, it will certainly change the way to eat.
0385341008|5.0|This is a novel told completely through a series of letters. The book is set in the post WWII time period in England and centers around journalist and author Juliet, who wrote a series of articles in an upbeat style throughout the war that were made into a book. As she looks for her next subject, she receives a letter from a man on the island of Guernsey who by chance found her name in a used book, asking her for help to find more books by the author, Charles Lamb. Her curiosity piqued, she writes back and slowly learns of the deprivations and courage of the islanders who were occupied by Germany during the war. Juliet is drawn more and more to the people there and the epicenter of their survival seems to be a woman named Elizabeth, who was arrested and taken away from the island. Juliet begins to work on a novel and realizes Elizabeth is the key. While a \\"quiet\\" novel overall, the stories of the times during the war tell of much suffering, bravery, and sacrifice. It is a wonderful historical fiction and I had a hard time putting it down.
0316098337|5.0|Jack is 5.  He lives with his ma and he loves to sit at TABLE and play games using RUG.  He sleeps in WARDROBE and spends hours of time with with his ma every day.  Jack loves his life. To his mother, it is a nightmare.<br /><br />What makes Jack different from all other five years olds is that he has spent his entire life in a single room having never see anything beyond and not even knowing that anything exists beyond the room.  Jack's mom was abducted when she was 19 and has been kept locked in this room for the past 7 years.  Told from the perspective of 5 year old Jack, we experience his life through his eyes.  He likes his routines and he enjoys how they make up games using paper bags or string.  He hides when OldNick comes to visit at night<br /><br />But things are about to change.<br /><br />ROOM is an extraordinary read.  I stepped into a read like no other I have read.  It took a few pages to get into the way Jack talks, and to fully get the understanding of his world, but once there, I could hardly put the book down.  What impressed me throughout this book was the devotion of Jack's mother.  Everything is for Jack and what that brings out in this read is a mother and son relationship that many of us would envy.  Jack is smart because ma has all day to teach him words, and spelling, and meanings.  When Jack asks questions about what he sees on tv, ma has all the time in the world (quite literally) to explain to him.<br /><br />What an amazing world Emma Donoghue created within these pages.  I was astounded at the great detail of Jack's character.  It wasn't hard for me to imagine five year old Jack being so smart because of all the access he had to be taught.  While this book is a fiction read I could not help but think about the real abductions that happen in this world, and stories like Ma and Jack;s that are sadly true.<br /><br />I would say this book is one of the best books I have read this year and would highly recommend that you take the time to read this powerful that at times made me laugh, and eventually.... made me cry.me laugh, and eventually.... made me cry.
B002UNMW7O|1.0|I don't normally write reviews but the one is so bad I can't help it! You people who gave it 4-5 stars are on dope.  Don't waste your time unless you think vulgar for the sake of being vulgar and using the \\"F\\" word unnecessarily every other line is cool.  The action sequences are dull: the 1st angle shows the boondock boys shoot, the subsequent angle shows the bad guys fall, ... rinse, wash, repeat.  Every shootout??? (did the bad guys even shot back?) scene was done the same way.  Agree with all the negative reviews.
B0027BOL4G|4.0|America has a population of well over 300 million persons living in it. If these 300 million persons each have 3 meals per day, that is a total of 900 million meals a day. This is a tremendous amount of food that has to be produced on a daily basis. What this film reveals is the dichotomy between the mass food producers and the small producers.     The small producers are seen as the ethical heroes who want things to be done in the clean old fashion way. On the other hand the massive food producers are seen as ruthless unethical businessmen. Graphic images of cows up to their knees in their own filth, and illegal immigrant workers with fingernail infections are seen. But the reality is that the small producers can never meet, or even come close to the vast daily demands for food.     There is an obvious problem here, if it is not addressed soon there can be some sort of food borne illness that can quickly spread, killing untold numbers in its path. After watching the movie (because you won't be sure what parts of it are staged) you ask yourself, what can we do about this? Most of us will quietly say nothing and after 15 minutes go on to the next movie. So, the problem remains and is probably getting worse on a daily basis as the population increases.
B001P9EQH8|3.0|You get what you pay for. After reading reviews that it is a great product for $20-odd, I got one hoping for a good bargain. turns out it is just a $20 product to boost audio (albeit not very well).  I have a zune hd and just got ultrasone pro-750s together with the E5. There wasn't any noticeable boost in treble or bass but could turn the audio louder than I could on max level on the zune. So the product does work as described (to a satisfactory degree).   However, what I am disappointed with is the faulty bottom headphone jack, which is way too loose than if i walked around with the zune and amp, i get distortions and noise from the loose connection and only hearing audio on the left side. I tried both cables (which are of cheap quality but surprisingly have gold-plated ends) and still have the same problem. Overall a product not worth getting in my case.
0316067938|5.0|I am a 42 year old mother of two.  After seeing all of the Twilight movies that have been released so far, I began reading the books, which were great!

What's wrong with a happy ending??
B00026WU9Q|5.0|Though he had already garnered quite a following on the folk circuit with his first four albums, it was on \\"Bringing It All Back Home\\" that Bob Dylan truly went from underground folk sensation to rock's poet laureate. It was here that Dylan first married his traditional folk sensibilities with contemporary rock sounds, and the results, though primitive, elevated his songwriting prowess one level closer to what he would soon achieve on \\"Highway 61 Revisited,\\" \\"Blonde on Blonde,\\" and later \\"Blood on the Tracks,\\" \\"Time Out of Mind,\\" and \\"Love and Theft.\\"<br /><br />The first half of the record contains reads like a 'Greatest Hits' collection, with some of the most lauded Dylan classics present and accounted for. \\"Maggie's Farm\\" has admittedly lost its bite due to the amount of times Bob has beaten it to death in concert over the years, but \\"She Belongs to Me\\" and the sumblime \\"Love Minus Zero / No Limit\\" stand strong as two of Dylan's finest and most sincere love songs, while \\"Subterranean Home Sick Blues\\" still rollicks with venom. \\"Outlaw Blues\\" and \\"On the Road Again\\" are admittedly forgettable in relation to the rest of the record, but the hilarious \\"Bob Dylan's 115th Dream\\" closes out the first side in style.<br /><br />The acoustic second side begins with the timeless, wistful strains of \\"Mr. Tambourine Man,\\" which careens into the ominous \\"Gates of Eden.\\" \\"It's Alright, Ma (I'm Only Bleeding)\\" is the centerpiece of this selection, with some of Dylan's most vicious social indictments spewed forth over a stark melody. The closing \\"It's All Over Now, Baby Blue\\" is one of Dylan's classic mournful ballads, and an appropriate way to end the record.<br /><br />\\"Bringing It All Back Home\\" signalled a new direction in Bob Dylan's career, one that would eventually establish him as the premiere songwriter of his time.

B003XL6EKS|3.0|I love The Killers--- I absolutely adore all the 3 albums that they have released do far. Brandon Flowers has the greatest new wave-type voice and is up there as the top vocalists of all time, at least in my book. Having said that, \\"Flamingo\\" lacked the magic the band has. It was a self-indulgent homage to Las Vegas. It was not bad, but it was not great either. Actually, it is sub par compared to The Killers. Is it pop? Is it jazz-y? But it definitely was not the alt rock I was expecting.    Having said that, Brandon, if you are reading this, I love you and the band. I just believe that there is magic when the 4 musicians collaborate and create music that comes out richer compared to just one person's vision.    I can't wait for the 4th Killers album and tour.
0307454541|2.0|A neighbor recommended this book to me, so I read it.  I was tempted a couple of times to stop reading(boredom) but forged ahead.  I finished it just so I could give my neighbor an informed opinion. Overall, I give this book a thumbs down.  On the plus side, the slow plot buildup(250 pages) drew me in.  Also, at this point, I found his writing style interesting and easy to read. He writes logically and is careful not to leave any unanswered questions.  The problem is, none of his characters are really all that interesting.  The middle and end part consist of cookie cutter storylines.  The originality and creativity which existed at the beginning, now disappear.  Cliches start to show up in his writing.  Furthermore, some of his writing veers off into unnecessary bylines.  Lastly, the story bogs down and limps to the end. At 590 pages, it's too long for what you get in return for your reading effort.  I don't intend to read any more of his books.  The spirit of this review is not to knock someone who has passed away. Rather, it's just my opinion shared with others.  May Stieg Larsson rest in peace.
0061148512|4.0|I read this book over the summer for school and I really loved it. I usually don't enjoy AP list books but I decided to give it a try because I needed a quick read. It was better than I expected and extremely well written. Some parts were a bit slow, but overall it was very good, and the ending was great.
B001M5UDGS|5.0|Every once in awhile, you get to watch something fresh, inventive, and entertaining.  \\"Dr. Horrible's Sing-Along Blog\\" is a 42 minute musical about a budding evil villain who is aspiring to join the Evil League of Evil, defeat his nemesis, and get the girl.  Neil Patrick Harris (currently starring in the TV sitcom \\"How I met your Mother) plays the villain, Dr. Horrible; Nathan Fillion (who starred in \\"Firefly\\") plays his nemesis, the somewhat anti-heroic hero Captain Hammer; and Felicia Day (who played \\"Vi\\" in Buffy the Vampire Slayer) is the love interest.<br /><br />The DVD version contains the musical, commentaries by the cast and creators (including a somewhat tangential singing commentary!), some \\"making of\\" featurettes, and 10 Evil League of Evil Application videos from fans.<br /><br />For a low-budget effort, it looks great, the actors are top-notch and are perfect for their roles, the story is alternately funny and touching, and the songs are fantastic.  Believe me, you'll be playing the DVD over again several times just for the songs ... or like me, you'll be considering ordering the soundtrack.<br /><br />The entire production was done on a budget of just over $200,000, and was shown for free on the web for a time.  The cast and the crew were not paid at the time of filming.  The intent appeared to be to drum up interest for \\"Dr Horrible\\" so that downloads from iTunes and DVD sales would pay the cast and crew, and also hopefully make some profit.<br /><br />Without giving anything away, I think the ending could have been a little better, but on the whole, this is fantastic entertainment and well worth purchasing.<br /><br />If you have a sense of humor and can appreciate an off-beat tale told well, I very highly recommend this DVD.  Bring on Dr Horrible 2!

B000W93CHC|5.0|What a great novel!   Mr. Follett has done marvelous research and has done a masterful job of wordcrafting to bring his 21st century readers into the 14th century England.    He has brought together the class system of feudalism together with the superstitious  understanding of sickness,  sin,  and  religion.     This great novel is full of love, hate, jealousy, and piety.           It is a wonder that western culture survived the plague and the Roman Catholic Church!    This is a novel that is important to the understanding of ourselves and the history of our generations long buried.       Praise the Lord that we are out of the dark ages... mostly!  Read this book and recommend it to others.

B003TML0VO|3.0|Yes, I see the reviews are all over the place on this one, and I have to agree wth most of those who were disappointed by this CD. I was also, and I had also been looking forward to hearing Carlos's take on these songs, but there are numerous flaws.  I can't help but notice that almost all the selections are before 1972. Have there been no good guitar songs in Rock since then? They did include something from Van Halen, and a couple of others. I do like several tracks, including the fact that they chose to do Willie Dixon's much-covered \\"I Ain't Superstitious\\" in the style of Jeff Beck from his Truth album. But, I wouldn't have considered \\"Riders on the Storm\\" as a guitar rock classic. Most importantly to me, the whole album is over-recorded, too \\"hot\\" or compressed to within an inch of it's life. I really don't know enough about the technical side of things to know exactly what they did here, but it actually hurts to try to listen to it all the way through. I'm sure this is part of the overall attempt to sell this to the younger crowd, as I assume is the reason for doing \\"Back In Black\\" as a Rap number! How do you figure that belongs on a tribute to great guitar songs? Anyway, I'm guessing that more of those giving this a great review are, in fact, from that younger crowd.  They don't, I'm told, listen to whole albums, and they like in-your-face sound quality, and they probably think that including NAS ia good idea. Marketing over music, I suppose.
B003TML0VO|1.0|From the tittle you will probably think that I am anti-Santana. No, I am a huge fan. Ran to the store on the same day the CD was released. Even, bought the deluxe edition. Now, I have a mixed feeling about the purchase of the deluxe edition. Bad feeling - wasted my money; good one - the DVD might compensate for my loss.<br />I was really waiting for a great album, specially seeing the names of the vocalists featured in the album; I personally like some of them. When I returned home from the store, I immediately started playing the CD. My wife left the room, because she felt tortured. I was forced to FF every song after first few second and going to the next one hoping that I might be able to tolerate it. Alas, it was totally dissapointing. Whoever like SUPERNATURAL or ULTIMATE SANTA or even SHAMAN, please don't even go near this one. It was really a Noise Pollution.
B000A59PMO|5.0|I starting watching this show on Netflix, and then found myself becoming a Veronic Mars Addict, watching all three seasons in two weeks!  What I do not understand is that the show has such great reviews, and has been given 301 five star reviews on amazon, and somehow the producer still thinks there is no market for the show!!  Be prepared to feel let down by there not being a fourth season.  I would still watch the first three seasons all over again, regardless of the somewhat unsatisfying season three ending.
B003L20IE2|5.0|Seriously, this film had everything a good film should have: action, romance, drama, comedy. The video game references were fantastic and was thoroughly funny through and through. I went into this movie expecting to see a decent film, but WOW, I did not expect this. After seeing it on opening day, I was pleasantly suprised how well the comic book effects worked and how great the acting was. I later decided to see it a second time in the theatre, a. because it was one of the best movies I've ever seen and b. because I wanted to make sure I felt the same way about it the second time, and I laughed just as much the second time through as I did the first. Instant purchase for me.
159562015X|1.0|I'm sorry, I'm just not too thrilled about StrengthsFinders. The free fake Meyers-Briggs test online gives a much more enlightening analysis of my strengths. While taking the test, I felt too often that \\"neutral\\" was the best option but it either meant that I felt strongly about both statements or that I felt neither applied. It did not, however, weigh which I was thinking.    On pages 154-155 in the StrengthFinder's book, in the same statement it tells me to give myself a break because my Restorative talents might make me \\"overly self-critical.\\" Ironically, the next sentence says the solution is to \\"redirect this towards things about yourself that can be fixed, like knowledge or skill-deficits...\\" Huh?! To avoid being too self-critical, I should look at myself and critique my failures. Perhaps a little common sense would have allowed the writers to better explain what they meant.    The most disappointing part about StrenghtsFinders is its vagueness. It honestly feels like a 6th-grade analysis of your best friend, \\"she's kind, happy, and creative!\\" For $10, I'm wondering when I am going to be enlightened about myself from knowing what I already know--very basic characteristic descriptions. I already knew I was positive, which is why I could answer the statement \\"I am joyful and happy about life\\" with little thought. You can imagine how profound it was when I read \\"You...always look out for the positive in every situation,\\" pg. 141. Did the author actually read this book? Was he truly shocked at his results and felt that he had a new outlook on life because of it? I guess I'm still trying to figure out who this is written for. It seems the target population might be more fitting at an elementary school than adults who have been working with themselves for decades.    I am also shocked at how many times Captain Obvious shows up in the book and the test results. For instance, if you tested as having the strength \\"Positivity,\\" the book profoundly suggests that \\"You will probably excel in a role where you are paid to highlight the positive.\\" Thank you, Captain. I would like to know what job pays me each time I tell someone I like their leather boots or when I give them a thumbs-up for bringing a quinoa salad to lunch.    Or how about a helpful analysis of my combined results? Don't just tell me I'm positive and like going with the flow, but what does it mean that I'm those things together? Major distinctions could be made about job-types that I would best fit based on various combinations of results. Instead I'm given a completely different job suggestion for each category. The Captain strikes again.    I'm sorry about my negativity, I am just incredibly disappointed. Please do yourself a favor and Google \\"free Meyers-Briggs test\\" before you waste 10 bucks. Or better yet, pay someone 10 bucks NOT to take this.
B002S0OBMS|4.0|I sincerely enjoyed this sequal to the Phantom.  Its brilliant and hope it comes to USA soon so that more of us can see it on stage.  And how about giving us a DVD?  The only thng I didn't like about the CD recording is the sound mixing. It ofen goes so low that I can't hear it and when I run up the volume I get blasted.  This is especially troublesome when listening while driving my pickup.      Another thing I would like to see done by Amazon or whoever puts out these CD's is to provide a better description of the difference between the regular edition and the deluxe.  The regular could sure use a libretto and more photos of the performing artists.  Maybe those are in the deluxe edition?

One of the best things about this book is Gerber's message around using the franchise model. He is not saying to buy a franchise.

I found the ideas in this book incredibly useful for my own business.  He taught me how to systematize my business so that it could run without me.

B000002LEE|5.0|Jane's Addiction was the last band that could write a brilliant guitar solo. Nothing's Shocking has many of them; check out the unusual, oscillating pitch of the solo in \\"Standing In The Shower...Thinking.\\" The solo is technically proficient, but also concise and very memorable rhythmically, sounding nothing like the standard guitar tones and templates of, say, eighties hair-metal. \\"Idiots Rule\\" has an equally great solo, and plus it's one of the few rock songs to successfully incorporate horns to create a jubilant party sound without over-emphasizing them and going into half-baked \\"jazz experiments.\\"    The focus on soloing and guitar skill comes from classic rock, but Jane's Addiction also had an arty, melancholy underside. Perry Farrell was a [[ASIN:B000ICL3CO Cure]] fan, and you can see it from the very first track, the near-instrumental \\"Up The Beach.\\" After a very low-key bass intro, it suddenly explodes in a burst of dense, yet atmospheric distortion. It's like a metal version of the intro to \\"[[ASIN:B000002H70 Plainsong]],\\" which was actually released a year later. And the bass line in \\"Mountain Song\\" sounds a lot like the one in [[ASIN:B00002DE4E Joy Division's]] \\"Isolation.\\" By picking up some production ideas from this sort of moody eighties rock, the album sounds much more modern than seventies guitar albums.    Nothing's Shocking also has a certain \\"underground\\" element. This is manifested more in the art direction and overall \\"attitude\\" than in the music. Jane's Addiction was a hedonistic band, like [[ASIN:B000000OQF most]] eighties metal acts, but Perry Farrell sounded like someone who partook of hedonism because he actually lived the marginal lifestyle and had nowhere else to go, rather than using it to show off and become famous. \\"Jane Says\\" is probably the most sympathetic rock song ever written. Heroin addiction and prostitutes are both common subjects for rock songs, but never has there been such a compassionate portrayal. Yet it's entirely convincing -- the song doesn't sneer, but it doesn't offer any rosy pictures of redemption, either. \\"Jane says she's never been in love / she don't know what it is.\\"    Farrell was the genuine article, the sensitive marginal who probably should have gone to art school, but was too fascinated by sloppy, dangerous living and seedy, kinky sex. The iconic arty nude sculpture on the album cover, the song that uses serial killers as evidence that \\"sex is violent,\\" and hilariously vacuous phrases like \\"some people should die, that's just unconscious knowledge.\\" One song advocates urinating while in the shower, and many songs consist of nonsensical disjointed phrases. And yet, this also comes with affecting sorrow in \\"Jane Says\\" and the lovely idyll \\"Summertime Rolls,\\" a love song expressed in the awkward language of a slacker youth (\\"I love her, I mean, it's so, so serious\\"), but all the more touching because of it, very gentle and sweet.    Dave Navarro lights the album on fire with incredible guitar work. I mentioned the solos and the dense, Cure-like production, but there's also quite a bit of variety in moods and tempos -- loud, hard, razor-sharp riffs in \\"Had A Dad,\\" \\"Pigs In Zen\\" and \\"Mountain Song,\\" gentle acoustic guitar in \\"Jane Says,\\" horns in \\"Idiots Rule,\\" a fragmented, multi-part progressive-rock composition in \\"Ted, Just Admit It,\\" and furthermore, every solo sounds different and original. Even the one-minute throwaway jazz instrumental \\"Thank You Boys\\" is fun. There is not a single generic filler song on this album.    Fun is the best aspect of Jane's Addiction. What really set them apart was their incredible [[ASIN:B000000WH8 lust for life]]. They inspired many nineties hard-rock bands, but they had a totally different tone. They weren't always happy, but at least they sounded like they fiercely wanted to be, like they knew it was something valuable. For this reason, Nothing's Shocking is best played on bright sunny days, and is a great summertime album.    If there's a hard rock album that captures the experience of being young, rather than being a product marketed to young people, this is it. It's a shame that after something so exuberant, emotional and uplifting, the band quickly broke up, but at least it added mystique to their short career. The followup [[ASIN:B000002LIX Ritual De Lo Habitual]] (1990) is similar in spirit (and also good summertime listening), but much more formless, without the tight and concise rhythms and solos. It was inevitable; the marginal life exacts a price...but in the right hands, that life makes for great stories.
B003HKN52A|4.0|I think it is worth purchasing, the only thing I was disapointed with is that when he went to another state or city on the tour he did not say where he was playing his concert at. I have been trying to find a list of all the places he played at and when he was there. I was hoping this tour would have told me more of where he played. I am glad I added this DVD to my collection!
B000001FMX|1.0|The NY Dolls, like most punk and glam from this period of the seventies - Lou Reed anyone? - had their moment in time because they were embraced by a culture that thought that these bandes were cool.<br />This culture also thought that it was cooler than YOU were.<br />CBGBs was their thing!<br /><br />Anyway, decades later and crap like this is the darling of music critics, who themselves were never cool.<br /><br />Well, what about the MUSIC?<br />The music on this disc is aweful.<br />Amateur crap, relying on image and attitude.<br /><br />If you buy it, you will not listen to it more than once or twice.
B00008OLYN|5.0|The distilled beauty, melancholy and poetry. The 'metalness' of this offering is not in brutal riffing or abysmall growling - (it has none of it) - but in the intensity of the musical journey.  You might also enjoy [[ASIN:B00377XY9M Labyrinths Of The Soul]] by LaughingSkull, if you liked this.
B00284BNKC|5.0|This movie is based on the novel of Hubert Selby Jr. and directed by Darren Aronofsky, one of the most talented people in the film industry. There's no happiness in life without suffering, and not always things play out the way we want, sometimes distorted expectations or false goals will keep us from finding true peace.<br /><br />This story exposes the life or 4 individuals, each one striving to achieve happiness through materialism, and it's this blind quest for their dream what ultimately destroys them in a cruel and sad way; it's really impossible not to feel empathy about these characters, because it's on their own hands to turn around from the path of grievance, but as story comes to conclusion there's no happy ending for them; hence the title requiem for a dream.
B0036EH3WK|5.0|I really love this version of the entire season. As a newer Blu-ray owner, I don't have any of the earlier seasons on Blu-ray, so not only do I enjoy the season 6 Blu-ray features, but all the previous seasons special features, also.<br /><br />All the hidden games and disk features are enjoyable, but the true highlight is the new 10 minute episodish feature called \\"The New Man in Charge\\" which answers still MORE questions.<br /><br />The Senet game is also really interesting, and I can't wait to try it with my friends! Worth the major purchase for a serious LOST fan.
0767802470|5.0|I saw the original version of this film in German as a young student.  It was so vivid that I remembered it in a way that lived in my mind, never losing its power over repeated viewings on VCR.  Now, with this version, an entire new dimension is added.<br /><br />Before, the film is predominantly about action, though you can recognize that the men are men and not merely fascists or bad guys.  In the new version, which does not have as fast a pace, you have an opportunity to plumb the depth of the characters, see how they are feeling and what their relationships are.<br /><br />The captain, of course, is at the center of everything.  He is aware of every single part of the ship and can see it as a whole in his mind, giving the right order at the right time in battle, seeing to repairs, or saving his men.  But he is also a leader, delegating to the right men, speaking the right word at the right time, his authority absolute and unquestioned by men who trust his with their lives.  The reporter, who presumably produced the manuscript of what is supposed to be a true story, is also excellent, a sensitive man who must abide the slights of a tight crew that is hardened in battle.  Three other characters impressed me:  the chief, his number one; an officer and decrypter with a great sense of humor; and the engine room specialist who cracks but later saves the ship.  Under these officers, there are the grunts.  They too are superlative actors.  Most of them seem very young in the beginning, but at the end they appear as middle-aged men.<br /><br />This deserves its reputation as one of the best war films of all time.  I believe it brings out the humanity in these men, who under Hitler were enemies of the western democracies yet were not evil.<br /><br />Recommended with the greatest enthusiasm.
B003L77GG0|5.0|I've seen every episode from Season 1-9 and own all 9 seasons. I can't wait for Season 10, even though it's the last season.
B000OVLBGC|5.0|This is one of the best cold war films I have ever seen.  It is about an expert Stasi officer, who genuinely believes in his mission - to find traitors to the socialist ideal - and yet he is having doubts about his current mission.  I am going to try hard not to ruin the viewing experience of others with spoilers.<br /><br />The man he must \\"ruin\\" is a greatly talented and officially nurtured writer, enmeshed in a situation that he is too naive to completely fathom.  As the pressure builds, everyone is forced to take a stand and to act.  The results are as terrible as they are unexpected, yet completely believable and moving, even tragic.  There is nothing in this part that is truly new - it is a drama that has been done countless times, however first rate this production.<br /><br />What is truly original, in my viewing, is the aftermath.  The wall falls, the files of the stasi files are opened to researchers.  After a chance meeting with a former bitter antagonist, the writer goes to explore what is written about his life, who betrayed him, who protected him.  It is devastating and inspiring all at once, a moment that crystalizes a life.  I was watching it with my daughter and it moved me to tears, at all the people who had suffered in the east, at the brutal movement of history that crushed individuals, ended relationships, and corrupted through fear, ambition, and abuse of power.  Afterwards, the future opens, with the continuance of life and even some forgiveness.<br /><br />This is a truly great film experience, the panorama of history before our eyes.  This is what only the best films can do.

0385504225|1.0|This is one of the worst books I ever read. The so called scientist (particle physicist to be particular) Katherine Solomon is the most annoying character in this book, and so are Peter Solomon and Robert Langdon. The IQ of Katherine Solomon is close to 70 in the book, and behaved as emotional as a school girl. The Noetic science is a joke, and the strange setting of her lab in Pod 5 seem totally unrelated to her amazing discovery that not only humans have souls, but the souls have mass. This is because the experiment with which she weighted her  college professor before and after his assisted suicide was clearly conducted in a hospital. Details apart, Katherine clearly do not understand the method of scientific research, that hard experimental evidence is the only way to prove or falsify an idea. Peter suggested that many important ideas in physics existed in ancient books so the ancients must know. This is false. The way of nature is limited, and the human ideas can be unlimited, as long as you search hard enough, someone must said in the past something that closely resembles the truth, but that mean nothing. Katherine apparently lost the debate in the book because she clearly could not think like a scientist that Dan Brown assumed she was. The multiple reference to Isaac Newton as a proof that he got his knowledge from the study of alchemy is simply ridiculous, and an insult to scientists.      Like Dan Brown's other books, the scheme is somewhat grandiose but what turn pages are the little tricks and puzzles the reader suppose to solve as he reads. This one is very bad because the puzzles were not presented in a clear enough way, and the solution of them was never elegant and just trivial. There are some places one can find cleverness, but that does not worth the large book one has to read.     Other problems of the book include rather unbelievable story about how the exposure of the ritual of masons can be a national security crisis. The behavior of the CIA director also sounds weird. Finally the story about Peters' son Zachary is totally predictable from the beginning of the book, but still sounds extreme.
B001O2S7XA|4.0|I purchased this toy as a Christmas gift for my 4-year-old. He absolutely loves it. He can play with it for hours. My toddler also loves to watch the cars go up and loop around the track. Whenever she pulls the track apart, I can easily fit the pieces back together again. A great introduction to race tracks!
B003VB5D84|4.0|I always look forward to The Crossroad Guitar Festival when it comes around, but unfortunately have never been as I live in California and it's usually sold out pretty quickly. The DVD's are about as close as I can get, and I consider these festival's to be like the World Cup of rock and blues. I was a little disappointed in this years festival (I saw the theatrical release), as I hold the 2007 festival to be one of the greatest concerts ever put on. However, this festival is nonetheless amazing. The same amazing, top tier lineup as in years past coming together to play some of the best music ever written. I even discovered a few new favorites, including Midnight In Harlem. It may not be like going to the actual festival, but it's as close as the majority of us can get. One of these days I am gonna go and see this festival (heck, I'd sell my kidney for a couple tickets). Until then, I can enjoy these fantastic DVD's. These are also good to keep around for our kids so they can see and hear what real music is after all the classic players have gone to the great beyond. Hey, gotta keep the music alive somehow, right?
B002ZG977Y|3.0|Like many others, I was a fan of the earlier version of Clash of the Titans.  This modern version is plagued by all the same problems that seem to be a part of today's movie making: the makers let the special effects dominate the movie, and dismiss everything else.  I loved this movie for the special effects, and it is worth watching, and even owning, just for that alone. The characters, the monsters, the battle scenes, the gods, etc. were all worth the price of admission.  My favorite part is that the winged stallion Pegasus is jet black, and has a herd of pure white winged mares. But I would have liked a little more story.  Another of the problems this movie has is its' near complete lack of color.  Everything is in muted shades of bronze, brown, black, gray and cream.  It totally amazes me that today, with fantastic fabrics in every color of the rainbow easily available, no one in Hollywood seems to think to use them.  For all the colors this movie has, it might just as well have been filmed in black and white.  Not to mention that many of the scenes, like the confrontation with Medusa, are so very dark that it is hard to make out the action.  Directors today seem bogged down by \\"historical accuracy\\" and \\"true to life\\".  But this story is not a history lesson, it is a fable.  The original Clash of the Titans remembered that it was a fairy tale,  used beautiful fabric and bright colors, had characters in it that looked like they bathed, and had bright backgrounds filled with light that let the audience see what was going on.  With the modern version, I felt like I should run it through a computer, and add color and light to it. As it is, the heros are brown, the monsters are brown and the backgrounds are brown.<br /><br />Moreover, the makers of this movie did nothing to tell even a bare bones story.  There is no reason in this movie for Perseus to rescue Andromeda, or to risk his life for the city---he is a stranger to the princess, and the people of the city have not exactly been friendly to him.  He is imprisoned, tortured and then forced into taking on the quest.  He should have taken off the first chance he got.  The idea that he has some vague idea of getting back at the gods is not sufficient.<br /><br />This movie is worth watching, with fantastic special effects, but I would have loved to see how much better it could have been with bright colors, more light and a better story.
B000002L99|5.0|This album + my air guitar skills = I got laid for first time in high school.  Highly recommend.
B002ZG98VE|2.0|I have a lot of problems with this movie.  It seems a shame that an actor of Russel Crowe's caliber cannot get a decent movie to display his skills in. If you are going to title a movie \\"Robin Hood\\" then I think that the story should have something to do with the fable of Robin Hood! There was nothing at all in this movie that I recognized from the story of Robin Hood that I am familiar with.  It is like the writers of this movie simply took the names from the original tale, and gave them to unrelated characters in this movie.  The only thing recognizable from the tale of Robin Hood (Robin being declared outlaw, Sherwood Forest, his merry men, etc.) all takes place in the last 15 minutes of the movie.     The rest of the movie has lots of epic battles, armies clashing, cavalry charges, etc.  Which was very well done and very interesting to watch.  However, I would have liked to see a little color.  For an epic movie, it seems the directors decided to go with true to life, which means that everything from clothes, buildings, background and everything is in shades of black, brown and gray.  Even the nobles, dressed in silk, brocade and jewels, were all in washed out, dull colors. The movie might just as well have been filmed in black and white.  With all the amazing fabrics and materials, in every color of the rainbow, covered with pearls, sequins, crystals, etc.,  we have at our fingertips today, I am absolutely comfounded that nobody in Hollywood seems inclined to use any of them. If you are filming in color, how about showing us some color?  Yes, I know that in the middle ages, nobody bathed, everybody had feas and rats, and dressed in drab clothes, etc.  But I am dammed well not interested in a history lesson when I watch a movie for entertainment.  Am I the only one who does not particularly want \\"historical accuracy\\" in my movies? I am heartily sick to death of historical accuracy. I think that is used as an excuse by directors with no imagination who can't figure out what else to do. If I want to study middle age history, art, society, building, or anything else, I am fully capable of doing so on my own.  Robin Hood is a fable---and I like my fables to have knights in shinning armor with rich trapings, my ladies elaborately dressed in beautiful colors, castles that don't look like mouldering ruins, feast tables that are not overrun with rodents, and characters who do not look like they don't bathe, stink, and have lice and feas.     This movie is worth watching for its epic battle scenes, but not for anything else. Even the ending is depressing. King John had promised reformation in order to get his nobles and people to fight for him. In the end, King John has broken his word and proven himself to be a lier, cheat and tyrant. Which means that all the people who had suffered, fought and died, did so for nothing. Everything that Robin Hood had done was for nothing. The tyrant wins and everybody else loses. That is far too close to what happens in real life for me to view it with anything but distaste. Robin is declared outlaw, along with all his friends. And Marion, her home and lands seized by the crown, has to go into outlawry with him. Nor is there going to be any rescue from King John.  In this version of the story, John has not stolen the throne. Richard is dead, and John is the sole heir. He has inherited the throne legally, and for life. And he is not likely to be issuing any pardons.  If you want the romantic and beauiful fable of Robin Hood, check out the old version with Errol Flynn.  That movie was made in the days when they still knew how to make movies for entertainment, movies that left you feeling good.
B002BU0DPE|1.0|This product is a complete waste of money.  There is a loud hissing sound that can be heard at all times.  It is less evident when sound is coming though, but when there is not the hissing is unbearable.  I would not have purchased these for 1/4 of the price.  On the plus side: They are comfortable, the cord is really long, and they were simple to install (plug and play).  However the hissing is so bad it almost gives me a headache.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I absolutely loved this book! Aside from the main character being a teenager, I would not have guessed it was part of the young adult genre. It did not have the cheesy, adolescent YA \\"feel\\" you sometimes get from novels geared towards YA. I was almost instantly and thoroughly engaged with a number of characters, and that did not change throughout the entire novel. The premise and storyline was unique, exciting, and emotionally-charged. I could hardly put it down and have already started the second book in the trilology. I love books that leave you dying to know the outcome of the characters and this one delivered on that front.
0345505387|1.0|I stumbled across Dragonfly in Amber a number of years ago in a used book store.  I was hooked.  I own all of the books in the Outlander series and am facinated with all the characters.  Like many other fans, it is difficult to wait three years for the \\"next chapter\\", so I eagerly awaited this new book and genre.    Truthfully, it is a major let down.  There is nothing new here and I don't find much of \\"Jamie's perspective\\" at all.  To me, it is the first part of Outlander reduced to nothing.  The graphics are not that great.  It's hard to tell who is who.  Also, in the cover graphic, it looks as though Jamie is holding a revolver which didn't exist at this point in history.    I would love to read a thousand page novel by Gabaldon that is written from Jamie's perspective.  Can I hope?    Please Ms. Gabaldon, don't do any more graphic novels.  Stick to your original format.  Your fans will be much happier.
B002M2T1UO|5.0|The packaging was fantastic, I got the version with the protective sleeves and all the dvd's are just fine. Love the layout of the packaging, took some time to go over it all. Besides a that the shield was the best cop show I've ever seen, and the nastiest. I'd say this was well worth the price I paid.
0345505387|1.0|I'm a huge Diana Gabaldon fan. I love her books. They are well thought out, well researched, and fun to lose yourself in. This? This was garbage that I'm sorry I spent my money on. And it pains me to say that.     It's hard to follow in some places. It will just jump to something else with no explanation. Being familiar with Outlander I could figure it out, but it was an effort. I can't imagine someone who had never read Outlander being able to make heads or tails of it.     And the art...Does anyone else remember MASH? Where Hotlips and Frank get a bust made by a Korean artist of Col. Potter? And the bust looks like a Korean version of Col. Potter? That's what this book made me think of. There is absolutely nothing wrong with looking Asian, for Asians...not Scotsmen and and an Englishwoman. It was distracting. And the characters all looked very much alike. I had to really pay attention to figure out who it was at times, at times I could not figure it out.     I was very disappointed and I had been looking forward to this for quite awhile. My copy is going on the used books sales list sadly.

0439023513|4.0|District 12 has been completely destroyed. Katness Everdeen, has been persuaded to be the symbol for the rebels who want to overthrow the Capitol. She has been reunited with many former Hunger Game survivors but not Peeta. He is being held in the Capitol and is being tortured daily. The tension mounts as Katniss and her companions attempt to help the rebels, rescue Peeta, and kill President Snow. Lots of twists and turns will keep the reader guessing who will win until the very last pages. A very satisfying conclusion to a great series. I couldn't wait to get the latest book but now that I have read it I am a little sad the wait is over. Harry Potter - dejavu. I predict young adults who are Hunger Games fans will read and reread the series.
0811874192|5.0|If you were wondering why the publication date of this AMAZING pop up book was so long delayed . . .LOOK AT IT!!!!  It's absolutely astonishing!

The ones who haven't been stunned speechless, won't stop talking about it.<br /><br />You'll see five exquisite, widely varied bouquets and arrangements that you can flip through, or--by employing the elastic cloth bands on the front and back covers to hold the pages open--actually place in a room as an arrangement, or as a beautiful paper sculpture. And the carefully combined color choices in each \\"Book-ay\\" guarantee that you'll find colors you will want to display.<br /><br />And because the blossoms are printed on beautiful heavy card stock, you'll enjoy \\"playing\\" with it too!

B003P2WO5E|5.0|I enjoyed Brandon Sanderson's Mistborn series but it didn't make my list but this novel is astoundingly good. It has magic, sympathetic characters, real suspense and so much more. Like the Mistborn books, this series is original. It's a page turner that's a real pleasure to read.

You get a 2 channel version as well as a 5.1 version done by separate Producers and I can not wait for other artists to utilize this absolutely great format.
B003TML0VO|4.0|For a covers album Santana's latest is very good indeed,clocking in at over an hour with a nice variety of songs and singers, this is certainly worth your $10. This is entertainment people, not a 1960's statement trying to change the world, get with the times please. Carlos is riffing throughout the album and sounds in fine form, yes after awhile some of it starts sound alike in the riff departments but once again, this album is about Santana putting his signature playing on other peoples tunes while still retaining the spirit of the original songs. I really like whole lotta love, back in black and dance the night away, my least favorites are probably little wing with Joe Cocker and While my guitar gently weeps with India Arie. Not one really bad track on the whole album, people are saying there is no passion on these songs and his playing is predictable, of course the riffing is predictable because one has heard the same notes over and over again in the original tracks, whats your point. I do think he should layoff the all star affairs and perhaps get back to his roots a little more and he probably well down the road.
0345505387|2.0|Just briefly, I want to state my main disappointments.  I struggled to tell the male characters apart.  The story lost its storyline since every other \\"bubble\\"  I had to try to figure out who was speaking.  Hair color, beard or beardless?  It was not fun.  Murtagh wasn't older and funny looking, for example.  He looked pretty much like Dougal, who looks like Colum (when Colum is sitting - ok he may be more pale) who looks like Kenneth, who looks like Randall when Randall wasn't in his red uniform.  I did like the distinctive drawing of the lawyer and Colum's bodyguard -- two characters I could recognize and enjoy.  Also, this was a familiar story told from the viewpoint of a different character (Murtagh).  But we didn't learn anything new about Jamie and Claire.  Therefor, I give this book a low score.  I am giving it 2 stars instead of 1, because it is a book of art, and tells a story in a different way which may appeal to a different set of fans.  However, to fans of the novels, this won't be satisfying or adding to the story.  (I disregard the Kenneth storyline, since it didn't add any new knowledge to the original story).  Had the characters had more distinction, I would have given more stars just for the beauty of the drawings.
B000NU2CY4|5.0|I have viewed this movie and find it to be perfectly acceptable.<br />Interesting other reviewers are using technical terms for equipment<br />required to reduce grain in film to even make it possible to fit on<br />a BD disk at all.

The latter is plain soft!<br />Non interger scaling from 4096 to 1920 is NG.<br />DVNR not DNR has been in use for years. Arrows vanishing? Maybe but<br />impossible at speed to tell.

0547258305|4.0|Conservative parents and readers beware.......the main character has premarrital sex and does not believe in marriage.      I enjoyed this book and her second book, Fire. I thought the book was exciting, romantic, and for the most part I enjoyed reading it.    I need a definition of YA by literary standard.  My definition would be 18 and older.
B00136NVH4|1.0|This is over the top and overly precious in every way.  If you like musicals and don't like rock, this might be your album to buy so you can think (incorrectly), \\"Oooh, I'm a rocker, too.\\"  Other than that, run away.  This is a high-school theatre version of Big Rock.

B002QXIMY0|4.0|Good remaster of a classic metal album from my youth.  The DVD of N.F.V. was pretty disappointing though.  It looks like they took a VHS copy that was sitting on someone's shelf for 20 years and transferred it to DVD.  Surely their master doesn't look this grainy.  Maybe it just looks worse on an HD TV like most older videos do, who knows?  A definite rush job and afterthought on the DVD unfortunately.
B001GAOY5U|1.0|Like one another, this BD is 2D not 3D as it shows. Why AMAZON do like this. Disappointed.
0345505387|1.0|I am a huge fan of Diana Galbadon's Outlander series.  I was extremely disappointed with this graphic novel.  The characters were well drawn in the first few pages but became completely different by the book's end.  If you compare the first pictures to the last ones, they look like completely different people.  I felt like the artist was too rushed to finish by a deadline or else someone else finished up the book.  I also didn't like that the characters looked Asian instead of Scottish.  I would not recommend buying this book.  If you really want to read it, try getting it a library.
B002ZCY7TG|5.0|I have just ordered today this bluray TV serie on Amazon.fr.    It will be released on the 3rd of December 2010 in France.    The price is now 30 Euros ( around 40 USD including the shipping at the actual rate of exchange), the same price as the DVD edition which is released the same day. But it contains a booklet with a  photo gallery of 10 pictures, not included in the dvd edition. I don't know if you have the same packaging in the US.    The same mistake appears on Amazon.com as on Amazon.fr : Carlos Bernard is not an actor of the 8th season (I remember he died (?) on the 7th.    Please people of Amazon, correct this mistake.

B003F3NDP8|4.0|\\"Desperate Housewives\\", the popular ABC drama series (created by Marc Cherry, \\"The Golden Girls\\", \\"The Golden Palace\\", \\"Amas de casa despesperadas\\") which started back in 2004 definitely has gone through some major ups and downs with its dark comedy storylines to its complex marriage or relationship problems but if there is one thing definite about the series... its that the the fans love it and to keep the fans interested, the series went through a significant change for its fifth season.<br /><br />\\"Desperate Housewives\\" is a series that had so many complex storylines that to even explain what has happened in the last four seasons would be difficult but if there is one thing that remains the same, it's our housewives.<br /><br />The premise of the first season was based around the death of fellow housewife Mary Alice Young (played by Brenda Strong, \\"Everwood\\", \\"The Help\\", \\"A Plumm Summer\\"). Mary Alice Young is the narrator of the series and every episode, she has setup the sequences of what is going on in the life of her friends. And its the housewives of Wisteria Lane who have lived complex lives full of love, betrayal, pain and sadness.<br /><br />For the sixth season of \\"Desperate Housewives\\", the housewives have new problems this time around.  Susan has married her second husband Mike, once again, but Katherine is not taking it quite well.  Bree is having an affair with Susan's first ex-husband behind her current husband, Orson's back.  Lynette is doing fantastic at her new career working for Carlos but as she is making her career dreams come true, now she and Tom face a new challenge as she is pregnant with twins.  As for Gabrielle, life as a mother is difficult, especially now that she has to watch over Carlos' teenage niece Ana but to make things even more complicated, a former flame comes back and she also has to deal with the pressures of being a parent.  We are also introduced to a new family who has moved into the neighborhood and a new housewife named Angie who has a major secret.  Meanwhile, a serial killer is on the loose and his victims hit the housewives of Wisteria Lane pretty hard.<br /><br />VIDEO:<br /><br />\\"Desperate Housewives: The Complete Sixth Season - The All Mighty Edition\\" is featured in Widescreen (1:78:1), enhanced for 16×9 televisions. \\"Desperate Housewives\\" looks very good on DVD. Outdoor scenes are nice and vibrant, blacks and low-light scenes do not have the excessive noise problems that some series tend to exhibit on a DVD release.<br /><br />For the most part, cinematography for \\"Desperate Housewives\\" has been excellent and the editing top notch. The series looks great and I can only imagine how beautiful this series would look on High Definition (via Blu-ray).<br /><br />AUDIO:<br /><br />\\"Desperate Housewives: The Complete Sixth Season - The All Mighty Edition\\" is featured in Dolby Digital 5.1 surround sound and pretty much, \\"Desperate Housewives\\" has always been a dialogue-driven television show and is primarily front and center channel driven. For the most part, dialogue is clear and understandable. The show uses minimal music and nor is it the kind of series that utilizes a lot of sound effects (the final episode has a little). For the most part, the setting I preferred to watch the series was to set my receiver setting and have stereo on all channels.<br /><br />The series includes subtitles in English SDH, Spanish and in French.<br /><br />SPECIAL FEATURES:<br /><br />\\"Desperate Housewives: The Complete Sixth Season\\" comes with the following special features:<br /><br />DISC 1:<br /><br />  * ABC Starter Kit - If you hit play all on disc 1, you will get the ABC Starter Kit which briefly explains about what happened in the previous seasons of \\"Desperate Housewives\\".<br /><br />DISC 5:<br /><br />  * Miss Piggy Gets Desperate - (10:40) Miss Piggy arrives on the set of \\"Desperate Housewives\\" and wants to be part of the cast of \\"Desperate Housewives\\".<br />  * Desperate Housewives Master Class - (13:04) The crew talks about challenges that the cast of \\"Desperate Housewives\\" have to face.

As each housewife deals with becoming parents and the story now benefiting from the five year advance, I felt that creator Marc Cherry did what he can to help jumpstart the series.<br /><br />Season four had the housewives dealing with a tornado, season five dealt with a new beginning for the housewives and now season six continues that storyline of the housewives learning about parenthood, others dealing with new loves, lost love and this time, with a new mysterious family moving to the neighborhood.  To make things even more crazy, there is a strangler on the loose and people are now ending up dead.<br /><br />I felt with the reboot last season, \\"Desperate Housewives\\" has a new fresh start and I liked how they had the storyline of Susan and Mike together (these two deserve each other and I can't see them with anyone else) but we also got that creepy feeling with Katherine going a bit crazy when she loses Mike and is unable to cope with the loss that well.<br /><br />Last season, the relationship between both Gabrielle and her daughters were hilarious to watch.  To watch Gabrielle and her daughters together is just fun to watch because she's not exactly sure how to be a good mother and her kids, especially little Juanita is also fun to watch as she has Gabrielle's attitude.  And the addition of Ana proves to be quite interesting as Gabrielle kind of sees herself in the teenager.  And as the rambunctious children of Lynette were always focused on in the first two seasons, it was great to see Gabrielle and Susan have these parenting contests against each other.<br /><br />As for Tom and Lynette, we tend to see how the couple has faced various challenges throughout the years and we have seen how Lynette had wanted to get back into a career and now she is very successful until she gets pregnant again and now scared to find out what would happen if Carlos finds out.  Especially since Carlos depends on her daily presence and even moreso as he promotes her to VP.<br /><br />And as for Bree, less focus on the actual business and more is focus on her infidelity with Karl, her relationship with Orson and finding out that her dead husband Rex has another child.<br /><br />Throw in another housewife who has her own set of skeletons in her closet and you have yourself an enjoyable sixth season of \\"Desperate Houswives\\".<br /><br />Saying anything more will spoil the series but I feel that those who were attracted to the dark but yet enjoyable and fun storyline of the first season, can find enjoyment with the sixth season. For the most part, I enjoyed the sixth season but I have to admit that I was expecting a little more from the strangler storyline (since the first episode kicked off with it) and something a bit more dark and sinister but for what it's worth, the way they ended things was OK.<br /><br />Especially with the Bolen storyline, at first it seemed that there was something rather significant and I liked how the storyline went, but somehow the urgency started to dissipate and I felt that the way the series ended with the family was fine.<br /><br />Usually, for \\"Desperate Housewives\\", I'mused to seeing a finale that is quite explosive or shocking but this year, it was an average season finale but for the whole season, I actually enjoyed this season.  The storylines were highly entertaining, I liked how the writers utilized the supporting characters such as Mrs. McClusky, Roy, Lee, Bob, Julie, Ana, Robin, Lynette's kids, etc. and incorporated them to the episodes and once again, I enjoyed each episode a lot.  It's just that if people were expecting something shocking and something that would have them in awe, the shock factor wasn't tremendous but it was good.  If anything, I felt that the buildup to the plane crash episode was more surprising but it will be interesting to see what the writers have in store for season seven.<br /><br />As for \\"Desperate Housewives: The Complete Sixth Season - The All Mighty Edition\\", the DVD set is a pretty solid release. I wish there was audio commentary for certain episodes like last year but there are none with this latest season DVD box set. But for the most part, you do get a few entertaining special features included and overall, it's another solid \\"Desperate Housewives\\" DVD release.<br /><br />If you are a fan of \\"Desperate Housewives\\", then \\"Desperate Housewives: The Complete Sixth Season - The All Mighty Edition\\" is definitely recommended!roves to be quite interesting as Gabrielle kind of sees herself in the teenager.

B003Y2XI8W|5.0|It's been years since I last wrote a review for an album on here.    \\"Conditions\\" by The Temper Trap is seriously one of the greatest albums I've heard since that time. To be honest, unlike many others, I didn't really take to \\"Sweet Disposition\\" when I first heard it on Sirius radio. I found it to be catchy enough, not something I'd jump to change the station, but not something I would buy either. Then I heard an in-studio acoustic performance they did, which included \\"Fader\\" and \\"Sweet Disposition,\\" among other songs, and that got me interested. Still, I held off on buying the album. Then, I saw them live this past June and was blown away at just how tight this band is even in a less-organized, live scenario. That was when I decided to get the album.    Now, after having listened to this album for a few months at least a few dozen times in full, the only song that I don't think rises to the five-star level is \\"Down River.\\" \\"Fader,\\" \\"Fools\\" and \\"Soldier On\\" are probably my three favorite tracks on the album, but \\"Science of Fear\\" and \\"Love Lost\\" are also worth mentioning as excellent tracks.    I saw them again this past August at Lollapalooza, and this time I enjoyed their show even more than before since I was familiar with all of the tracks on the album. Dougie sounds just as good live as he does on the album, and they are not afraid to extend the songs to jam out a bit, which is sometimes an issue with bands that sound this polished on the studio albums. This album is definitely a solid buy, and their concerts do not disappoint either.
0345505387|3.0|I am a huge Outlander fan and love to read about Jamie and Claire. While it's interesting to see the book in a graphic novel format, it falls short. I don't think the story line of Kenneth really fit well and the book overall doesn't capture the emotional relationship of Jamie and Claire. Also, many of the characters looked the same so it was hard to tell one from another.
B0043CM27A|5.0|I am attracted to albums with high prices.  I had heard that this was overpriced and when I checked online I was pleased to see that, yes, it was... but not enough!  If only they had charged just a little bit more!!!!!!
B003F3NE1Q|5.0|I bought this for my mother, I honestly dont know how she got into Grey's Anatomy, she recently retired after having worked 3 jobs for the past 20+ years so I guess now she is just enjoying kicking back and one day came across a rerun of the show. Needless to say, she is addicted.  She really seriously loves this show, its all she talks about, she calls me just to tell me that someone went around shooting all the surgeons because his wife died.  She sends me text messages at work telling me that someone ran to stop the procedure on a patient that is allergic to something they were injecting...and as you can see I still have no idea what she is talking about.      But she loves this show, I bought her all of the seasons so that she can catch up, and of course she called me at work asking me if I was going to watch the New Season with her.
B000274THQ|4.0|In 2003, director Wolfgang Becker's film \\"Good Bye, Lenin!\\" (written by Bernd Lichtenberg and Becker) became a major success in the box office making over $79 million worldwide and the film won six European Film Awards and a winner of nine German Film Awards.  The film would feature cinematography by Martin Kukula and music by Yann Tiersen (\\"Am&eacute;lie\\", \\"Night Shift\\", \\"In Your Wake\\").<br /><br />VIDEO:<br /><br />\\"Good Bye, Lenin!\\" is presented in 1:85:1 Anamorphic Widescreen.  Picture quality varies as there are some parts that utilize old archived footage of East and West Germany ala 1989-1990 and tries to mix them with the more modern cinematography.  Modern cinematography is good but at times, I did see some parts with some haloing issues.  The film does utilize CG for a variety of scenes in order to make current Germany ala 2001 look like German in 1990, so the filmmakers and crew had a lot of work in trying to recreate that time period.<br /><br />Picture quality is good for DVD but I hope this is one title that Sony Pictures Classics considers for a possible Blu-ray release in the near future.<br /><br />AUDIO & SUBTITLES:<br /><br />\\"Good Bye, Lenin!\\" is presented in German Dolby Digital 5.1.  The dialogue and music is clear and understandable through the center and front channels.  Good use of surround channels for fireworks and other sound effects.<br /><br />Subtitles are in English.<br /><br />SPECIAL FEATURES:<br /><br />\\"Good Bye, Lenin!\\" comes with the following special features:<br /><br />  * Audio Commentary by Director Wolfgang Becker - Director Wolfgang Becker gives us the breakdown of how certain scenes were created, making the film look authentic and working with the various talent.<br />  * Cast Audio Commentary - Audio commentary by Daniel Br&uuml;hl and Katrin Sa&szlig;.  The two talk about their scenes and joke around about their look and performance.<br />  * Deleted Scenes -(44:02) There are ten deleted scenes with a few that include optional commentary by Director Wolfgang Becker and editor Peter R. Adam.  Both talk about the challenge of editing the film down from 3 hours to 2 hours.<br />  * Lenin Learns to Fly Visual Effects Featurette - (20:32) Interviews with director Wolfgang Becker and the 3D team behind \\"Good Bye, Lenin!\\".  The crew discuss the challenges and work they did in trying to make the film look authentic and filming in 2001 but capturing how Germany looked in 1990.  From eliminating certain advertising areas, using advertisements of that time and a lot of CG work that had to be implemented throughout the film.<br />  * Mini Making-Of Featurette - (1:26) A short behind-the-scenes making of the film video montage.<br />  * Uncut \\"Aktuelle Kamera\\" Broadcasts - (7:53) The full uncut broadcasts of Denis's faux news casts.<br />  * Previews - Upcoming Sony Pictures Classics trailers.<br /><br />JUDGMENT CALL:<br /><br />\\"Good Bye, Lenin!\\" was no doubt a major hit in Germany, especially for those who are nostalgic by the sight of familiar foods to the various news footage of that time.  Although I'm sure I'm missing out on certain details that Germans would easily pick up, I did find myself quite entertained by the actual ruse and how long can Alex keep it going for his mother.<br /><br />While described as a comedy film, it's important to note that it is not comedy in the American sense, and if anything, I would call it more of a black comedy with a mixed style of elements as it also is a coming-of-age film, a dramatic film and also a tragic film.<br /><br />I may not fully understand how it was like living in East Germany, let alone the West but I can feel sympathy to the characters in that life has changed so much for them during the unification.  Used to the GDR way, GDR products and government services, all was gone during the unification and in many ways, it was a new beginning. And I've read that the film's popularity resides within the nostalgia of the benefits from those services back then.<br /><br />But for me, I just found it so entertaining of how far Alex would go to keep his mother alive, to not scare her and to make her final year of living as comfortable as possible.  This is a son's love for his mother, having to see what had happen to her without their father, to see her suffer a nervous breakdown and I'm sure that sense of guilt has haunted him in the fact that he is responsible for his mother being hospitalized and putting her in a coma.<br /><br />The faux news broadcasts created by Alex and Denis was very clever and the overall performance by Daniel Br&uuml;hl and Katrin Sa&szlig; was fantastic.  Also, one of my favorite German actors Burghart Klau&szlig;ner (\\"The White Ribbon\\", \\"The Edukators\\"), despite a shorter role, did a tremendous job playing the father who makes his return.  I felt that Wolfgang Becker did a wonderful job in making sure to convey to the 3D artists of capturing that 1989-1990 look especially in 2001 and also giving us that sense that the film had taken place long ago.  Wonderfully edited and the music by Yann Tiersen was also as noticeable.<br /><br />I know I am reviewing this DVD a little late in 2010 versus 2003 but it's still a wonderful film from Sony Pictures Classics which I hope is released on Blu-ray in the near future.  As for the DVD, print quality is good (not great), audio quality is good (love the use of the surrounds for this film) and there are a good number of lengthy special features and two commentary tracks as well.<br /><br />\\"Good Bye, Lenin!\\" is not a political film, nor does it try to be.  But there is a political message.  If anything, the film has an entertaining storyline that hooks people due to nostalgia and also serves as a goodbye to a belief one had to the past but also a goodbye as we know the mother, the inspiration of the ruse, does not have much time left in this world.  But also to see Alex reconstructing Germany that his mother can understand and possibly appreciate.<br /><br />Once again, I'm sure this film probably hits home to a lot of Germans and probably for those who lived in East Germany.  To see how consumerism and the changes in society came upon them quite quickly and it was a perspective of life that I have never really thought about until I watched this film.  So, I actually enjoyed the fresh storyline and enjoyed this film a lot.<br /><br />Overall, \\"Good Bye, Lenin!\\" is a very good film and Sony Pictures Classics really gave this film an awesome release on DVD back in 2003.  But hopefully the reconsider this film for a Blu-ray release in 2010/2011.  Definitely worth watching!er and to make her final year of living as comfortable as possible.

B000002A46|5.0|This is one of the biggest selling Chritmas albums of all time, I believe its top 3 in the world and its no wonder because its nothing short of amazing!!!    I love this album!  play it year around and it never gets old! I own several copies of this and even bought the updated versions, and I also gift this album as presents every year. Her voice is so angelic and beautiful in these songs, she went with very different elements for a more current and up to date Christmas album mixing Pop, Urban, and a little bit of Jazz and Classical! (For some it might be a little bit to much but if you're not sure about this album listen with open ears and no preexisting judgment)    My favorite songs are \\"Christmas Baby come home,\\" \\"O Holy Night,\\" \\"All I Want For Christmas Is You\\" and \\"Jesus what a wonderful child\\" ... i just love the whole album!!!      I cant imagine how anyone could rate this album any lower than 4 stars! It's quite obvious that the people who rated the album one star only rated it that low because they have a vendetta against Mariah, they didn't even give a review about why they didn't like the music instead they just bashed her personally with lame jokes, a sign of jealousy and low self esteem!

B001GZ6QEC|5.0|I admit I was not really a fan of Heath Ledger and hadn't seen any of his other movies besides maybe 2 or 3. Put damn did he do the Joker justice in this movie. Its a shame he passed at a young age because this could have been it for him this could have shot him straight to the top. Bale is no slouch as Batman either. This is easily one of the best if not the best movie ever made. Yeah I said it.
B0032JTV6U|5.0|With a lot of hype behind the teen musical/comedy/drama series \\"Glee\\", many people catching \\"American Idol\\" wondered what this new series would be about.  The series created by Ryan Murphy (writer for \\"Nip/Tuck\\", \\"Popular\\"), Brad Falchuk (producer for \\"Nip/Tuck\\") and Ian Brennan would gain attention because of its music but for the most part, it would prove to become successful with its catchy music (with actual talent that can sing), a witty storyline and its well-cast characters.<br /><br />The series proved to become so popular that two soundtracks have been released for the television series and even was nominated for four 2010 Golden Globe Awards.  With support from various media sites to even celebrities and a fanbase that have branded themselves as \\"gleeks\\". \\"Glee\\", although not exactly original (\\"Fame\\" was known for its musical teens in the 1980's and the teenage jock musical was featured heavily in the Disney \\"High School Musical\\" films) and a cast of talent playing teenagers from various ethnicities and even one who is handicapped, \\"Glee\\" manages to capture the drama of high school life but also the fun of watching this group of underdogs trying to succeed.<br /><br />\\"glee - The Complete First Season\\" features the following 22 episodes on seven DVD's.<br /><br />VIDEO:<br /><br />\\"glee - The Complete First Season\\" is presented in widescreen 1:78:1.  Shot digitally, this is a series that I'm sure would look fantastic on the Blu-ray release.  As for the DVD release, picture quality is cool as some parts showcase the vibrant colors of the series but one thing I noticed is that the pilot episode definitely shows a lot of noise but as the series progressed towards the second half of the first seaosn, picture quality was much better.  Blacks are nice and deep and skin tones look natural on the DVD but for the most part, picture quality for \\"glee\\" very good on DVD.  But for those who are concerned with picture quality will definitely want to \\"glee - The Complete First Season\\" on Blu-ray.  Otherwise, the DVD is good.<br /><br />AUDIO & SUBTITLES:<br /><br />\\"glee - The Complete First Season\\" is presented in English 5.1 Dolby  Digital Surround.  The series is front and center channel driven but with those who own modern home-theater receivers may find it a benefit to have the audio set at stereo on all channels if they have a 5.1, 7.2 or higher setup.  Audio is clear and understandable but what matters for a series such as \\"glee\\" is how the music sounds and for the most part, music sounds great.  There is crowd ambiance in the school hallways or chatter in during the competitions but for the most part, \\"glee\\" is a front and center channel-driven soundtrack.  And similar to the video, if you are an audiophile, then you will definitely want the lossless soundtrack and go with the Blu-ray version.<br /><br />Subtitles are presented in English SDH, Spanish, French and Portuguese.<br /><br />SPECIAL FEATURES:<br /><br />\\"glee - The Complete First Season\\" comes with the following special features:<br /><br />DISC 4:<br /><br />  * Welcome to McKinley! - (5:02) A video of Principal Figgins introducing 8th graders to his office before they go to McKinley High School.

It's really interesting to see how the group dynamics start to evolve from the beginning to the 13th episode and by the second half, you can tell that the hiatus leading to the second half of the series and the popularity of the series definitely made the series get a boost in the types of music that can be utilized, better production value and the cast seem to gel much more.<br /><br />And it's no surprise as 2009-2010 have been incredible for the cast members and crew.  From award nominations, the cast receiving love from a lot of television show critics and soundtracks that continue to sell incredibly well.  \\"glee\\" also features solid writing that goes hand-in-hand with the awesome musical performances and for the most part, \\"glee - The Complete First Season\\" is a fantastic DVD set.<br /><br />But what hooked me to the series was the music.  Personally, I'm not a fan of covers but the fact that the people on the show can sing and for the most part, how the songs are incorporate to the storyline has definitely made me a weekly viewer of the series.

Will, a teacher and the director of the Glee Club deals with his marital strife with his wife, who is determined to make sure her husband doesn't leave him.  Quinn must deal with being a single mother, Mercedes deals with her weight, Artie deals with being in a wheel chair, Curt deals with how people look at him because he is homosexual and each characters has their own set of issues.

Throw in Jesse St. James of Vocal Adrenaline, throw in Curt falling for Finn, Quinn having to deal with her pregnancy and finding friendship from a person she never expected to get close to, seeing things develop between Will and Emma and more.  And of course, Sue Sylvester was absolutely wonderful this season.  And as for the music, especially with the Madonna and Lady Gaga episodes, the music for the whole season was fantastic.<br /><br />There is no doubt that \\"glee\\" is a series that now has a great budget to license these songs for television, CD and also for the DVD release and just by seeing the sheer amount of songs used on each episode, I'm sure that the music takes a big chomp out of the budget.

It's a series that is fun to watch, cool characters, solid performances and a series that has a fantastic soundtrack.  \\"glee - The Complete First Season\\" is highly recommended!ts on working on the \\"glee\\" finale and making the Vocal Adrenaline performance work and utilizing Queen's \\"Bohemian Rhapsody\\".    EXTRAS:    \\"glee - The Complete First Season\\" comes with a slip cover case.    JUDGMENT CALL:    The first time I watched \\"Glee\\" was its pilot episode and thought it was pretty fun concept, especially with the popularity of musicals such as \\"High School Musical\\" but what I liked about \\"Glee\\" is that you have your average students and the members of Glee Club are pretty much the underdogs that are picked on by the jocks.  It's really interesting to see how the group dynamics start to evolve from the beginning to the 13th episode and by the second half, you can tell that the hiatus leading to the second half of the series and the popularity of the series definitely made the series get a boost in the types of music that can be utilized, better production value and the cast seem to gel much more.    And it's no surprise as 2009-2010 have been incredible for the cast members and crew.

B002GZQY6Q|4.0|This is another fine album from a band that I have been following for a while now.  Surprisingly, although this group has been cranking out albums that more or less feature the same approach, it still sounds fresh to me.  The Incident (2009) is no exception though I might be a little biased.<br /><br />The two-disc set features the lengthy track \\"Incident\\" on Disc 1 and a handful of tracks on Disc 2 (cumulative running time = approx. 75 minutes).  Come to think of it, if I were to change anything about this album, it would have been to lop a few tracks off Disc 2 and squeeze everything onto one disc. Regardless, the tunes on Disc 2 are pleasant enough.  Disc 2, however, does not hold my attention nearly as strongly as The Incident song-cycle.<br /><br />Clocking in at a little over 55 minutes in length, the fourteen part \\"Incident\\" song-cycle has all of the key Porcupine Tree elements: heavy passages alternating with quieter passages; melancholy minor keys and nice melodies.  Central themes are restated here and there, which lends the piece some continuity. The vocal harmonies are also quite nice and Steve still has a strong and clear lead vocal.<br /><br />While I generally enjoyed the whole album, my favorite tracks include \\"The Blind House\\" and especially \\"Time Flies\\".  Although \\"Time Flies\\" borrows heavily from the album Animals (Pink Floyd, 1977), there is enough originality to the track that it holds my interest.  The one tune that did not work for me was \\"Drawing the Line\\".  Although this could have been a nice track, the chorus section is a bit too \\"alternative rock\\" for my liking.  Fortunately the chorus section is short, so the listening experience was not ruined.<br /><br />The overall package is nice and features a booklet that displays the lyrics, production credits and some arty images.  The overall sound quality is OK, although it could have been mixed better - there is not too much clarity.<br /><br />All in all, this is another good album from one of the better rock groups out there.  The Incident is recommended along with Fear of a Blank Planet (2007), In Absentia (2002), and Signify (1996).The Incident is recommended along with Fear of a Blank Planet (2007), In Absentia (2002), and Signify (1996).
0553805371|5.0|It seems Stephen Hawking's publisher has finally figured out he isn't a very good 'splainer. I browsed \\"A Briefer History of Time\\" and discovered he had little ability to explain things in a clear and simple fashion -- indeed, he often sidestepped any /real/ explanation. For a man immobile below the neck, he does an enormous amount of hand waving.<br /><br />In this book he's paired with a British writer, Leonard Mlodinow. Mlodinow is everything Hawking is not -- clear, elegant, insightful. To put it simply (but no simpler), this is one of the best books of \\"popular science\\" I've ever read, including those of George Gamow. (Yes, I'm that old.) As a technical writer, I find my own work embarrassed by the elegant clarity of Mlodinow's writing. And it's essentially math-free, which makes it all the more remarkable. I suspect the true author is Mlodinow, with Hawking's name attached for saleability.<br /><br />I do have some complaints. The use of flat maps to model models is absurd, when spherical maps exist (p8). A good editor (hah!) would have caught this. And despite the book's discussion of the nature of reality, it never deeply addresses the question of whether the material universe \\"really\\" exists -- as Flynn says in \\"TRON\\", \\"This isn't happening, it only thinks it's happening.\\" The latter is the demonstrable truth, but Mlodinow fails -- or refuses -- to consider it. It is, after all outside \\"science\\".<br /><br />Happily recommended, especially to those with little or no knowledge of modern physics. If you have some knowledge, you might prefer to borrow rather than buy.
B0000524CY|5.0|We figured we might as well start out with the iconic religious horror film, The Exorcist. While some horror movies become dated over time, this one retains its bite even after 25 years; the fears it plays upon are still strong, unlike movies that focus on atomic war. The plotline also is representative of a common sub-genre within religious horror--the disillusioned priest who regains his faith through extreme trials in which scholarship and science fail. The cold, clinical scientists do nothing but cause Regan enormous fear and pain, with no relief; only faith and religion can save her. It is a trial, but a trial worth struggling through, and a trial that is brought upon purely out of a desire to free Regan from the horrors that inhabit her, not scientific curiousity. An interesting commentary on science, religion, and faith, as well as a genuinely scary movie even without new-fangled sfx!

B003DKJ5ZU|4.0|Tinker Bell, a fictional character that was developed back in 1904 by J.M. Barrie and later on in 1911 in the novel \\"Peter and Wendy\\" is best known for her appearance in the 1953 Walt Disney film \\"Peter Pan\\". The character is quite iconic for Disney, as she is quite literally the unofficial mascot for the Walt Disney Company and can be seen in many of their commercials and in 2008, the character received her first animated film which was direct-to-DVD and Blu-ray.<br /><br />After the success of the first \\"Tinker Bell\\" film in 2008, the whole gang returns for the second film titled \\"Tinker Bell and the Lost Treasure\\" in 2009 and now in 2010, Tinker Bell returns with \\"Tinker Bell and the Great Fairy Rescue\\" available on Blu-ray+DVD and DVD.<br /><br />VIDEO:<br /><br />\\"Tinker Bell and the Great Fairy Rescue\\" is presented in 1080p High Definition (1:78:1). If you thought the animation was an improvement with the 2009 release of \\"Tinker Bell\\", the third film has improved much more. It's so amazing to me, because the people behind the \\"Tinker Bell\\" films only have so much time to work on them and to see how much the animation has improved between \\"Tinker Bell and the Great Fairy Rescue\\" from last year's \\"Tinker Bell and the Lost Treasure\\".<br /><br />There is much more detail on the actual characters.  Movements, scenery, water and overall detail has improved as well.  And where the last film focused more on Tinker Bell and Terence within trees and dark set areas, \\"Tinker Bell and the Great Fairy Rescue\\" is much different as they are outdoors and we see how the weather changes from sunny, to rain storm and then to night, so we get to see separate environments from within the cottage to the outdoors.<br /><br />Every character is vibrant with colors, sharp and everything is quite detailed including the skin of the characters. You actually see Tinker Bell's cheeks having some color and also the skin pigments of other characters as well. It's much more defined it seems compared to last year's characters.  May it be more focus on the skin maps and textures or technology upgrades, everything about this latest Tinker Bell film looks much better than its last two predecessors.<br /><br />And I can continue to list so many positives from the plants, the clothing, the accessories and the beautiful backgrounds, the lush green grass, the water effects, the trees and even the animals are well detailed with their hair effects. Also, the special effects via CG from the lighting effects utilizing the pixie dust and then my favorite, the animated facial expressions, is just definitely great to look at. Although not a big budget theatrical film, \\"Tinker Bell and the Great Fairy Rescue\\" looks absolutely beautiful.<br /><br />Granted, it's important to note that this is a direct-to-video film and that the animators have a short time making these films compared to the bigger budget Pixar releases.  So, by no means do I want to say that \\"Tinker Bell and the Great Fairy Rescue\\" is going to meet the same animation quality of larger budget animated film such as \\"Toy Story 3' or \\"Up\\" but having seen how this film series develop and knowing the animators have only so much time, I give them credit for what they are able to accomplish within a year's time.  For a direct-to-video film, \\"Tinker Bell and the Great Fairy Rescue\\" looks great!  So, for the most part, this High Definition transfer of the film is absolutely pristine and gorgeous to look at. Another solid Walt Disney release on Blu-ray!<br /><br />As for the accompanying DVD, the film is presented in Widescreen (1:78:1) - Enhanced or 16×9 Televisions.<br /><br />AUDIO:<br /><br />As for the audio, the audio is presented in English 5.1 DTS-HD Master Audio (48 kHz/24-bit), French and Spanish 5.1 Dolby Digital and all sound effects come alive. Dialogue is clear and understandable through the front and center channel, as is the beautiful orchestral music. Good use of the surround channels as the flow of sounds from the action sequences can be heard all around. From the ambiance of the workers at Fair Camp to the thumps and crashes of pans during a scene in the kitchen or in Lizzy's bedroom.  Also, good use of surrounds during the storms and you can hear the rain pattering as well as hearing the cars from the distance as they get closer to the fairies. Overall, a well-done lossless soundtrack.<br /><br />As for subtitles, the film is presented in English SDH, French and Spanish.<br /><br />The DVD, the film comes with a Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround Sound soundtrack with English SDH, French and Spanish language tracks.<br /><br />SPECIAL FEATURES<br /><br />\\"Tinker Bell and the Great Fairy Rescue \\" comes with the following special features presented in 1080p and 480i, English and French Dolby Digital and subtitles that are in English SDH, French and Spanish:<br /><br />  * Tangled - Exclusive Sneak Peak- (3:39) A special early look at Walt Disney's upcoming animated film \\"Tangled\\".

No friends and her father is literally busy with his research and has no time for her.  So, she is attached to Tinker Bell and for her to believe that fairies are real, is simply a wonderful time for her but also knowing that Tinker Bell can't stay with her.<br /><br />So, you have that emotional component to this film but then you have Vidia and friends (who we have seen in the previous films) who participate in the more adventure-parts of the film.  We see how these fairies need to rescue Tinker Bell (as they fear humans) and because of the rain storm and their wings are wet, they can't fly or use their fairy magic.  So, they have to depend on using what they have and trying to make a boat and get from the summer camp to the cottage where they think Tinker Bell is being held in a cage against her will.<br /><br />I really enjoyed this third film and it's a great family film and in my opinion, it's the best Tinker Bell film of the three films thus far.  An improvement in storyline, more characters (and utilization of characters) and also a major improvement of characters and various scenery in different weather conditions and thus various, colorful scenes.<br /><br />\\"Tinker Bell and the Great Fairy Rescue\\" will attract younger and older audiences with its friendly screenplay and beautiful animation and music. The majority of all fairy characters (primarily Tinker Bell's friends) are back and overall, itwas a very enjoyable film. The Blu-ray definitely continues Disney's commitment for the best quality for their High Definition releases (again, picture and audio quality are both magnificent) and there's really nothing to be disappointed with this release at all. Also, included is a DVD for the kids or for long commutes as well.<br /><br />Parents who are wondering if this film is scary at all, there really are no scary parts.  You have your usual cat who looks mean and wants to eat Tinker Bell and friends but really, there is nothing scary about this film at all.  And most importantly, you do not need to watch the previous two films to enjoy the third.  Although, it will help in knowing the relationship that Tinker Bell has with characters like Vidia or Terrence or what is fairy dust by watching the previous two films, but they are not really essential to enjoying the third film.<br /><br />Overall, if you are a looking for a Disney animated release for your children (especially those who love fairies) and for the whole family, \\"Tinker Bell and the Great Fairy Rescue\\" is highly recommended!er Bell and the Great Fairy Rescue\\" was another enjoyable film featuring the popular and iconic Disney character.

B003VANOFY|3.0|After owning this headset for a month & 1/2, I've decided to edit my review as it's performance has improved. Originally given 1 star, I now would grade this headset as 3.5-4 stars. My initial concerns were addressed in a driver update. Also the sound quality seems to have improved (possibly the set was \\"burned in\\").<br />PROS:<br />1. Sound quality is good to begin with and gets better as the phones get \\"burned in\\".<br />2. Logitech has acknowledged the initial problems and issued driver updates.<br />3. 7.1 Surround sound is obvious even listening to cable TV.<br />4. Wireless feature and battery life work as advertised.<br />5. Everyone has a different definition of comfortable. For me, comfortable headsets are unnoticeable unless I focus on them and allow for hours of use without pain. These do both.<br /><br />CONS:<br />1. Headphones are not simply plug and play. There is a specific way these need to be set up and I've had to do more to tweak this headset than any others I've ever owned. But once you get there, you are rewarded with very good sound.<br />2. Headphones have an auto turn off feature if sound isn't detected within 5-10 minutes. So if you're the type who goes this amount of time in between sound output, you will have to repeatedly turn off the headphones and then turn them back on.<br />3. Turning on the headset requires you to hold the button until the input is recognized. Sometimes this is immediate, sometimes it takes several seconds.<br />4. Base sound can sometimes be distorted.<br /><br />Summary: The sound quality of the headset overcomes it's non-ease of use. Worth is relative so I cannot say whether you should spend this amount for the set. I am very satisfied with my purchase.<br /><br />**UPDATE** 12/11/11<br />Well it's been over a year & these are still kicking.  No broken parts, still decent sound.  I'm still peaved by constantly having to turn the set back on constantly when you go several minutes without sound.  I could understandif I used them as wireless, but I don't.  Overall dropped the rating to 3 for the inconvenience factor & the fact that they can't play bass very effectively.  When it comes time to replace these, I'll look elsewhere.<br /><br />**UPDATE** 02/28/12<br />I've used these pretty much daily since I bought them back in Sept 2010.  The ear muffs have been peeling (cup around the ear) for a couple months now & today parts of the material started to just fall off onto my desk.  They've been adequate but not outstanding. Time to buy a new headset but I won't be buying this again.  A decent life span considering the amount of time I used them I suppose.
0545123283|2.0|If you enjoyed Shiver, it would be worth checking out this book from the library (i.e. reading it for free) to see where the story goes.  But be prepared for it to purge your pleasant memories of Shiver and dull your taste for any further reading in this series.<br /><br />I enjoyed Shiver, although I was occasionally incredulous that the Grace character was so very similar to Bella in Twilight.  However, the story had strongly romantic scenes and the Sam character was lovely, so I generally enjoyed it.<br /><br />Linger, on the other hand, really never gets off the ground.  One third of the way through, you can tell where it's headed, but then you spin your wheels on new characters that also never get anywhere before the goods on Grace are finally delivered in the last few pages.  Sam actually becomes a bit tedious.
B003L20IE2|5.0|You can watch this by yourself, with friends, or with your girlfriend and will love it.  It flashes between over the top action and legitimately heartfelt scenes.  You care about the characters who's humors range between dry and slapstick.  One of the best movies of 2010.

B003UYUR10|4.0|For many of us who grew up playing video games on a PC, one game that captured our attention (no, not Lode Runner) was a game called \\"Prince of Persia\\" created by Jordan Mechner.<br /><br />Since 1989, we have seen the game evolve to the action, graphically impressive video game on the current gen video game consoles and continues to be a popular video game franchise.  And in 2010, Walt Disney Pictures, courtesy of producer Jerry Bruckheimer (\\"Pirates of the Caribbean\\" films, \\"Black Hawk Down\\", \\"Bad Boys\\" films, \\"National Treasure\\" films, \\"Armageddon\\") and director Mike Newell (\\"Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire\\", \\"Donnie Brasco\\", \\"Four Weddings and a Funeral\\") along with screenwriters Boaz Yakin, Doug Miro and Carlo Bernard went to work on the film adaptation, cinematographer John Seale (\\"Poseidon\\", \\"Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone\\", \\"The Perfect Storm\\", \\"The Talented Mr. Ripley) and Harry Gregson-Williams (\\"Shrek Forever After\\", \\"X-Men Origins: Wolverine\\", \\"The Taking of Pelham 1 2 3') composing the music for the film.<br /><br />If anything, the filmmakers odds were against them as video game to film have not really had much success.  And for \\"Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time\\", the film received mixed  reviews from the critics but at the same time, this CG-driven film budgeted around $150-200 million made around $329 million in the worldwide box office and is expected to make more in home video sales.<br /><br />VIDEO:<br /><br />\\"Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time\\" looks absolutely fantastic.  Presented in 1080p (2:40:1), the film looks absolutely stunning.  You can see the detail on the surface of the clothing, the wood, the stubble on Gylenhaal's chin, skin pigmentation and more.  Colors are absolutely vibrant with orange, amber hues that are seen in the film and the wonderful CG work when Dastan uses his dagger.  Blacks are nice and deep, detail is just magnificent.  There are scenes that uses a weak light source, ala candlelight so there is some black crush present as detail are not as pronounced on scenes with very dark shadows but by no means does this hurt the picture quality of the entire film.<br /><br />I didn't notice any artifacting, banding, combing, aliasing, anything negative.  If anything, this is one of the best PQ live-action films to come from Disney.  Very impressive!<br /><br />As for the accompanying DVD, the film is presented in 480i (Widescreen 2:40:1 - Enhanced for 16×9 televisions).<br /><br />AUDIO & SUBTITLES:<br /><br />\\"Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time\\" is presented in English 5.1 DTS-HD Master Audio (48 kHz/24-bit).  The lossless audio of this film is absolutely fantastic.  The dialogue and music is crisp and clear and what is more impressive is the use of sound.  From the arrows zipping and panning from right to left and a scene where a man is using a steel whip against Dastan and you hear that whip swirling all over the soundscape.

So, I think that given the success of the film, we will more than likely see a \\"Prince of Persia\\" sequel.<br /><br />In some ways, having played and still purchasing many incarnations of the video game, it was one thing to expect the main character to jump on walls and buildings.  I wasn't expecting a labyrinth or floors breaking apart and our hero would fall to his death like the video game but I was expecting a more meatier adventure-based story between Dastan and the princess.  In some way, almost an exciting adventure story similar to an earlier \\"Indiana Jones\\" style of film.  To get away from the typical video game film mindset of popcorn action flick but a film with more substance than glitz and beauty.<br /><br />Afterall, you have a talented director, cinematographer and composer, you expect an action-driven film but a good story.  But in many ways, \\"Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time\\" follows the list of debased films in which they look great (and look and sound spectacular on Blu-ray) but if anything, it's not a film that stands out in your mind, nor do you feel inclined in wanting to watch it again (unless you are a Jake Gyllenhaal or Gemma Arterton die-hard fan).<br /><br />The performances were fine but Ben Kingsley, I've seen him act with a tremendous amount of passion in films before and in \\"Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time\\", I felt he was a bit subdued as Nizam.  Gemma Arterton was very good, sexy, beautiful as the Princess Tamina and definitely a major 180 from the character of her \\"St. Trinity's\\" films.  She's an actress that can take on any kind of character and it shows  And also you have a good number of talents with Alfred Molina, Richard Cole, Ronald Pickup, Toby Kebbell and Steve Toussaint doing a good job as well.<br /><br />But as for the main actor, Jake Gyllenhaal, there was no doubt we would see the well-known actor taking on an action-based role and showing off his athletic nature (and physique) throughout the film but similar to Ben Kingsley, we have seen these two talents really shine in non-action films, in this case...the character of Dastan had the flair of the action silent star Douglas Fairbanks but at the same time, the storyline of Fairbanks film made you enjoy the film even more, in this case...everything seems like a blur as our protagonist is all over the place.  Yes, it's true to the video game...jumping, fighting, climbing, etc. but I would have enjoyed more time focused on character development.<br /><br />\\"Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time\\" is definitely a Blu-ray that shines in the video and audio category.  The picture quality is fantastic and the lossless audio was very impressive.  Special features were OK, but I prefer to watch special features independently, not selecting them while watching a film.  So, I'm not the biggest fan of Disney's \\"CineExplore\\" but it's all subjective to the viewer.<br /><br />For those who do not want the DVD and digital copy but only the Blu-ray, a Blu-ray single disc release of \\"Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time\\" will be sold separately as well.<br /><br />Overall, \\"Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time\\" does show it's faithfulness to the video game franchise.  There is plenty of action in this film and for the most part, it is a good popcorn action flick, but for those wanting something deeper, you're not going to find it in this film.  But if you want a fun, action-driven film, nothing more and nothing less, \\"Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time\\" is definitely for you.erton was very good, sexy, beautiful as the Princess Tamina and definitely a major 180 from the character of her \\"St. Trinity's\\" films.

193413712X|1.0|As more than a few have said, this book lacks a plot and is extremely uninteresting and a huge bore.  I made it through the entire book though, and basically it is a dying mans ramblings and clips of memories.  Most of the time I had no idea of what was going on or what the \\"point\\" was, but maybe that was the \\"point\\".  If you want to know what a dying/hallucinating man is thinking and dreaming than this is the book for you.  It was entirely disconjointed, complete waste, and I find it hard to believe that it actually won a Pulitzer.      Bottomline, don't waste your time or effort on this book.
B003F3NDWG|5.0|Witty, suspenseful and fresh! The first season of \\"CASTLE\\" is the modern \\"Moonlighting\\" featuring a cool cast and each episode with an entertaining storyline.<br /><br />\\"CASTLE\\" debuted on ABC as a mid-season replacement and began airing on March 2009. Created by Andrew M. Marlowe (\\"Air Force One\\", \\"End of Days\\" and \\"Hollyw Man\\") and executive produced by Rob Bowman (\\"The A-Team\\", \\"The X-Files\\", \\"Day Break\\") comes a new drama series on crime solving.<br /><br />The first season which featured 10 episodes stars actor Nathan Fillion (\\"Firefly\\", \\"Drive\\" and \\"Desperate Housewives\\") as Richard Castle. The famous mystery novelist who is adored by many but behind-the-scenes, he is a playboy who has an on-and-off fling with his ex-wife (who is an actress), another ex-wife who is his publisher and lives with his bright teenage daughter Alexis (Molly Quinn, \\"My One and Only\\") and his meddlesome mother and former Broadway actress, Martha Rodgers (Susan Sullivan, \\"The Nine\\", \\"Dharma & Greg\\").<br /><br />There is a lot of pressure on Nathan to create another book and with him stuck, his luck starts to change when he meets by-the-book Detective Kate Beckett (Stana Katic, \\"Heroes\\", \\"The Spirit\\", \\"Quantum of Solace\\") who is investigating several murders which have taken place and the way that they were done were like the murders featured in several of his novels. Because of his knowledge of how things end up with his books, he gets the opportunity to assist the detectives in their case.<br /><br />Eventually, Richard Castle discovers that he can do several things in his life. Write his new book based on Detective Beckett, see if he can woo Detective Beckett and most of all to investigate other murders which he can incorporate ideas for his new book. At first, it seems implausible but with Castle being so well-known and friends with the mayor, Captain Montgomery (Ruben Santiago-Huds0n) will do what he can to make the mayor and his boss happy, so he allows Richard to tag along with Detective Beckett.<br /><br />Needless to say, she's not happy about it but with his skills of mystery writing and her skills as a detective, the two find out that together, they can be an effective duo in crime solving. Also, joining Beckett are Detective Javier Esposito (Jon Huertas), Detective Kevin Ryan (Seamus Dever) and forensics doctor Dr. Lanie Parish (Tamala Jones).<br /><br />In the first season, Detective Beckett and Richard Castle have worked together in handling various cases.  But one case that Richard would like to investigate is the death of Detective Beckett's mother but Beckett doesn't want him getting into her personal business.<br /><br />In the second season, Richard continues to work with Dr. Beckett and together they try to solve a variety of murder cases including one that deals with a serial killer going after Detective Beckett.  This season also shows us how Castle and Beckett seem to  start showing some affection towards each other but in the process, Beckett becomes closer with Detective Demming.<br /><br />\\"CASTLE - The Complete Second Season\\" features 24 episodes on five discs.<br /><br />VIDEO:<br /><br />\\"CASTLE - The Complete First Season\\" is presented in Widescreen (1:78:1) and is enhanced for 16×9 televisions. The drama series is quite slick as it gives you the feel of New York and like many abc studios related DVD releases, Disney has always done a good job with their TV show transfers. A show that balances outdoor and indoor shots with good lighting, the picture quality for \\"CASTLE\\" is pretty solid. I didn't see any major artifacting issues or low level noise that was distracting.<br /><br />AUDIO & SUBTITLES:<br /><br />As for the audio, the series is presented in Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround Sound. The series is front and center channel driven with a few episodes (that involve gun fights) utilizing the surround channels. The series does utilize quite a bit of music and for the most, the series is understandable and clear.<br /><br />Subtitles are in English SDH, French and Spanish.<br /><br />SPECIAL FEATURES:<br /><br />\\"CASTLE - The Complete Second Season\\" includes the following special features:<br /><br />DISC 5:<br /><br />  * On Set With Seamus & Jon - (7:39) Interviews with Seamus Deaver (Detective Kevin Ryan) and Jon Huertas (Detective Javier Esposito) giving a tour of the set of \\"Castle\\".<br />  * On Location With Nathan - (6:50) Featuring Nathan Fillion showing us the crew of \\"Castle\\" on location.  From those working in audio, craft services, assistant directors, transpo drivers, set production, props, etc.<br />  * Manhattan's Most Unusual Murders -(7:57) Creator/executive producer Andrew Marlowe along with other executive producers, writers, director and cast as they talk about coming up with interesting, unusual and innovative murder cases each week for Castle.<br />  * Misdemeanors: Bloopers & Outtakes - (2:36) Outtakes from season 2 of \\"Castle\\".<br />  * Deleted Scenes - (9:07) Featuring three deleted scenes: Take 5, More Morlock and Alibi & Timeline.<br />  * Music Videos - (2:37) First season bloopers.<br /><br />JUDGMENT CALL:<br /><br />\\"CASTLE\\" continues to be a fun and entertaining detective series.  Despite not being a detective, popular crime author Rick Castle is very good at solving cases and assisting Detective Beckett with her cases.  And through the first season, we know that sooner or later, the sparks are going to fly between the two characters (or will they?).<br /><br />Both Rick Castle and Detective Kate Beckett are just polar opposites but you know that there is this sexual attraction there that makes their chemistry work onscreen. In a way, both are like Bruce Wayne (Batman) in the way they are keen in investigating things. Castle, as a mystery writer and having done a lot of research, puts himself in the shoes of the criminal and thinks of the many possibilities that can exist between the characters.  Detective Beckett, almost having a similar tragic Bruce Wayne story is a by-the-book detective and for the most part, have their unique way of feeding off each other in terms of handling a case.<br /><br />Nathan Fillion and Stana Katic do a great job and have good chemistry onscreen.  Especially the number of verbal quips that writers have included this season for the characters. Here are a few examples from this season:<br /><br />Castle: If something were to happen to me I want you to watch out for Alexis. She looks up to you, and if a worth man would get frisky you can shoot them.<br />Beckett: Nothing is gonna happen to you.<br />Castle: But if it does...?<br />Beckett: Ok.<br />Castle: And would you also go into my closet and get rid of my porn collection before she finds it?<br />Esposito: Don't worry, Bro. I got you covered in that.<br /><br />Castle: I knew there was something I didn't like about him. Too pretty. Bet he takes yoga classes just so he can pick up girls... Probably subscribes to The New Yorker but doesn't even read it... just leaves a copy layin' out where people can see it.<br /><br />Castle: Do you believe people get what they deserve?<br />Beckett: Well, if they do then I must have done something terrible to be punished with you.<br />Castle: Funny.<br /><br />Beckett: You know Castle, sometimes I forget that you have such a capacity for pure innocence in your life.<br />Castle: Yeah, plus it was a great place to pickup chicks.<br />Beckett: Then you open your mouth and you ruin it.<br /><br />Very hilarious season and the writing is also top notch.  The murder cases were absolutely interesting this season and I have to say that the more serious serial killer two-part storyline was fantastic and would love to see more of those serious storylines for season three.<br /><br />With that being said, I often wonder where the characters of Castle and Beckett will go.  For season two, things are now becoming a little bit like \\"Moonlighting\\" (for those who remember the 1995-1998 detective series withCybill Shepherd and Bruce Willis) in which there is sexual attraction and viewers are teased of when these two will actually hook up.  But whereas the hookup pretty much spelled the end of \\"Moonlighting\\", hopefully \\"Castle\\" writers manages to do something different.  Personally, I liked where this Demming/Beckett story is going, especially seeing how Castle reacts with it.  Maybe Castle will find another woman in his life and it will be interesting to see how Beckett likes it.<br /><br />Aside from the Castle/Beckett sexual tension of the season and the unique murder cases, season two also features more storylines involving characters Detective Esposito and Detective Ryan which was very cool.  It's great to see the writers stepping things up and to tell you the truth, nothing wrong with adding a few more characters into the mix.  Would love to see another female detective (possible rival to Beckett).<br /><br />This season also featured more Lanie Parish and very little of Captain Roy Montgomery.  It would be great to see the writers utilize these characters a bit more.  But overall, I'm glad the writers did utilize more characters in this season.  I definitely enjoyed the addition of Detective Tom Demming (Michael Trucco, \\"Battlestar Galactica\\") and I felt the storyline involving the serial killer and Special Agent Jordan Shaw (Dana Delany) were fantastic!  But with Delany busy with \\"Desperate Housewives\\", I doubt we are going to see more of her anytime soon.  And I definitely enjoy the storylines that involve Castle's daughter Alexis and meddling mother Martha.  Although, it will be interesting to see a storyline that involves Alexis, that would be a great emotional storyline for Castle as his family's life hasn't really been pulled into anything serious.<br /><br />But with two season's playing it safe (despite season two's exciting serial killer episodes), I get a feeling that season three may get a bit serious and possibly episodes leading to tragedy.  Dare I say it, with the majority of ALL  ABC drama series pulling the tragedy card this past season with the exception of \\"Castle\\", I wouldn't be surprised if \\"Castle\\" did the same for season three.<br /><br />As for the DVD, \\"Castle - The Complete Second Season\\" is once again, another solid release.  Where the first season DVD box set, all we got was only ten episodes, we did get a good amount of special features including audio commentary.  With this season being 24-episode long, we get no commentary and several special features.  Also, the few special features on this second season DVD box set features Nathan Fillion, Jon Huertas and Seamus Dever but yet nothing on Stana Katic.  What's up with that?  I'll let it slide this time around but let's have a Stana Katic special feature for next seasons DVD box set!<br /><br />Overall, \\"CASTLE - The Complete Second Season\\" is another humorous, exciting and fun series and I look forward to the third season.  Definitely recommended!a Katic do a great job and have good chemistry onscreen.   Especially the number of verbal quips that writers have included this season for the characters.

B000ICM5MG|3.0|The movie arrived in a reasonable time. There are lots of entertaining insights from the actors and filmakers retrospecting on the film and other numerous extras. The only real downside is the poor sound quality. I found that I had to turn up the volume on my tv way above what I normally had it set to to hear the dialogue.
B002IFOY5C|5.0|Of course this movie has a great cast, but for some reason it was never properly promoted. Several stand out performances, especially from Stallone and Liotta(probably his best since \\"Goodfellas\\"). I think a lot of people who watch this movie think it's going to be like Rocky meets Goodfellas(especially K-Dawg) but this film doesn't take the easy way out and gives you an original story with conviction. De Niro's roll is very minimal, so don't expect to see him a lot, but if you like good movies with great acting, you won't be disappointed.
B002RWKSII|3.0|I bought this cd...so the \\"business side\\" is taken care of. Brian could've done \\"Burt Bachrach\\", or some other composer as well...but he loves Gershwin. Fair enough. The album's not bad but it's just not that great.  When Brian follows his muse and doesn't allow himself to be processed it's much better than this...he is well liked \\"warts and all\\"!
B003F3NE1Q|5.0|In 2005, \\"Grey's Anatomy\\" became a critically acclaimed television series that would become ABC's top rated dramas and winner of two Emmy and Golden Globe Awards.<br /><br />Created by Shonda Rhimes (\\"Private Practice\\"), the drama series revolves around a group of interns and their experience at Seattle Grace Hospital. As well, as a few of the other doctors of the hospital. Throughout the first five seasons, we see these interns become residents and experience relationship problems and also the stress and challenges they face as resident doctors.  The last season was a bit more dramatic as love was lost, love was found and we saw one of the main characters battling cancer, while another dies in a tragic accident.<br /><br />Season six features a merger between Seattle Grace and Mercy West and this season introduces us to new doctors and characters who will have an impact on the current main characters.<br /><br />NOTE: On \\"Grey's Anatomy - Complete Sixth Season\\", there is an extended episode of the season finale \\"Episode 126 - Death and All His Friends\\".<br /><br />VIDEO:<br /><br />\\"Grey's Anatomy - Complete Sixth Season\\" is presented in Widescreen (1:78:1) - Enhanced for 16×9 televisions. When it comes to television drama series, \\"Grey's Anatomy\\" is one of ABC's highly rated dramas that although filmed in a hospital setting.  The cinematography for the final episode was excellent.  For the most part, the series looks good on DVD, nice good closeups and skintones are natural and during low light scenes, I didn't see any major noise or compression artifacts. For the most part, the fifth season does look very good on DVD.<br /><br />It's important to note that since the release of the fifth season of \\"Grey's Anatomy\\", that season received a Blu-ray release and more than likely, there will be a Blu-ray release for this sixth season.  For those who want better picture quality and lossless audio, I recommend the Blu-ray release.<br /><br />AUDIO:<br /><br />As for audio, the series is presented in Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround Sound and the series is primarily dialogue and music driven. Dialogue is clear and understandable, while the music has always played a major part for the series and definitely enhances certain scenes.  I did notice more surround usage in the final two episodes.  From the sirens, gun shots, crowd ambiance being utilized through the surround channels.<br /><br />The show is presented in English SDH, Spanish and French subtitles.<br /><br />SPECIAL FEATURES:<br /><br />\\"Grey's Anatomy - Complete Sixth Season\\" includes the following special features:<br /><br />DISC 4:<br /><br />  * Seattle Grace: On Call -  Featuring all six web episodes of \\"Seattle Grace: On Call\\" (about five minutes long for each web episode) that were shown on abc.com.  A short series featuring a documentary on the interns Steve, Megan, Ryan, Pierce and Graciella at Seattle Grace and a few of the new residents (Reed and Charles) that transferred to Seattle Grace from Mercy West Hospital and Dr. Owen Hunt all hanging out at the local bar hangout with Joe the Bartender.<br />  * The Making of Seattle Grace: On Call - (2:30) Featuring the making of \\"Seattle Grace: On Call\\" and interviews with the cast and crew.<br /><br />DISC 5:<br /><br />  * Chandra Wilson: Anatomy of a Talent - (13:11) Chandra Wilson (who plays Dr. Miranda Bailey) is the first of the main talent to direct episodes for the show.  The show creators and talent, including Chandra Wilson talks about how she became a director and certain parts of the episodes that she directed.<br />  * Dissecting Grey's Anatomy: Unaired Scenes - The following are a total of nine deleted scenes from various episodes.<br />  * In Stitches: Outtakes - (2:13) Outtakes from the sixth season of \\"Grey's Anatomy\\".<br />  * Extended Scenes - Extended scenes for \\"The Time Warp\\", \\"Nervous Callie\\" and \\"Sad State of Affairs\\".<br /><br />''DISC 6:<br /><br />  * Extended episode of \\"Episode 126 - Death and AllHis Friends\\" - (Duration for this extended episode is 1:01:16, the original episode is 42:58) This extended episode features more dialogue, especially the scenes that include Dr. Webber, especially an extended scene with Lexie, Dr. Altman and Dr. Sloan with Dr. Karev in an ambulance, emotional scenes with Lexie and Dr. Sloan and additional scenes that include the police.<br /><br />EXTRAS:<br /><br />\\"Grey's Anatomy - Complete Sixth Season\\" comes with a slip case.<br /><br />JUDGMENT CALL:<br /><br />I admit that I was critical and harsh of the fifth season of \\"Grey's Anatomy\\" and just felt the show was heading downhill through the first half and the season managed to pick up during the second half.  So much was focused on the problems on the set with Katherine Heigl and T.R. Knight.  And eventually, we know how things have ended up in the season finale.<br /><br />With last season focusing on Izzie's cancer, her relationship with Alex and problems in the relationship between Meredith and Derek and dealing with Callie and Lexie's personal issues... I felt that with the sixth season \\"Grey's Anatomy\\" is desperately needing to step things up with the writing as I have felt needed to interject some new blood, new energy before the storylines focusing on these characters becomes overly stale.<br /><br />And sure enough, the writers have achieved that with the sixth season.  The merger between Seattle Grace and Mercy West was probably the best thing to happen with this show because we have new characters.  Also, we have stories focusing on Derek and Richard's troubles, we get to see more of Arizona (especially Arizona and Callie), the introduction of Teddy and most importantly, the introduction to the new residents coming from Mercy West.  These four characters have brought some new life to the series and I was really rooting for them because I can see potential storylines that can come from these new characters.  I felt \\"Grey's Anatomy\\" had new energy, new life and I'm stoked about the series all over again.<br /><br />That was until the shocking season finale.<br /><br />All I can say is... \\"Wow!\\".  Although we have seen a similar type of storyline on \\"ER\\" several years ago, it's a big gamble as you don't know who is going to be killed off.  But suffice to say, this season finale was a major success and the writer's have crafted one of the most impressive season finale's in a drama series within the last decade.  A fantastic way to end the season and at the same time, a bit bittersweet as some characters that may have grown on us will not be back due to the tragic season finale.<br /><br />Needless to say, \\"Grey's Anatomy\\" writers really did a fantastic job with this season.  I felt the fifth season, although good, was in somewhat of a slump and I have to admit, the season opener of the sixth season, wasn't all that great either.  But as the episodes progressed and seeing how these newer characters were integrated into show, I definitely saw the potential, almost like \\"Grey's Anatomy\\" reborn and seeing its greatness return to television.<br /><br />As for this DVD set, there are a good amount of special features including the web episodes of \\"Seattle Grace: On Call\\", deleted scenes, a featurette on Chandra Wilson as a director and the extended episode of the season finale.<br /><br />With that being said, there's not much I can say badly about \\"Grey's Anatomy - Complete Sixth Season\\".  It was well conceived this season, the acting was very well-done (and I can understand some hardcore fans feeling that their original characters were not utilized as much as previous seasons but with more characters, the series needed new energy and these newer characters provided that) and overall, it was a solid season that literally ended with a bang.<br /><br />If you are a fan of the series, \\"Grey's Anatomy - Complete Sixth Season\\" is definitely recommended!ue, especially the scenes that include Dr. Webber, especially an extended scene with Lexie, Dr. Altman and Dr. Sloan with Dr. Karev in an ambulance, emotional scenes with Lexie and Dr. Sloan and additional scenes that include the police.    EXTRAS:    \\"Grey's Anatomy - Complete Sixth Season\\" comes with a slip case.    JUDGMENT CALL:    I admit that I was critical and harsh of the fifth season of \\"Grey's Anatomy\\" and just felt the show was heading downhill through the first half and the season managed to pick up during the second half.  So much was focused on the problems on the set with Katherine Heigl and T.R. Knight.  And eventually, we know how things have ended up in the season finale.    With last season focusing on Izzie's cancer, her relationship with Alex and problems in the relationship between Meredith and Derek and dealing with Callie and Lexie's personal issues... I felt that with the sixth season \\"Grey's Anatomy\\" is desperately needing to step things up with the writing as I have felt needed to interject some new blood, new energy before the storylines focusing on these characters becomes overly stale.    And sure enough, the writers have achieved that with the sixth season.  The merger between Seattle Grace and Mercy West was probably the best thing to happen with this show because we have new characters.  Also, we have stories focusing on Derek and Richard's troubles, we get to see more of Arizona (especially Arizona and Callie), the introduction of Teddy and most importantly, the introduction to the new residents coming from Mercy West.  These four characters have brought some new life to the series and I was really rooting for them because I can see potential storylines that can come from these new characters.  I felt \\"Grey's Anatomy\\" had new energy, new life and I'm stoked about the series all over again.    That was until the shocking season finale.    All I can say is... \\"Wow!\\".  Although we have seen a similar type of storyline on \\"ER\\" several years ago, it's a big gamble as you don't know who is going to be killed off.  But suffice to say, this season finale was a major success and the writer's have crafted one of the most impressive season finale's in a drama series within the last decade.  A fantastic way to end the season and at the same time, a bit bittersweet as some characters that may have grown on us will not be back due to the tragic season finale.    Needless to say, \\"Grey's Anatomy\\" writers really did a fantastic job with this season.  I felt the fifth season, although good, was in somewhat of a slump and I have to admit, the season opener of the sixth season, wasn't all that great either.

B000TGCR38|3.0|Black Book has gorgeous photography, brilliant costuming, fine performances and good writing.  Unfortunately, much of this is squandered on a preposterous story line.  How could anyone over ten take this story seriously?  Let's take just a few of the more outrageous examples.  The evil doctor heading the Dutch resistance group is constantly in the midst of fire fights rife with automatic weapons fire, yet we are supposed to think, what?  That the German soldiers somehow know he's on their side and miss him?  The Germans in Holland are relaxed and happy in April of 1945, even throwing a luxurious party to mark Hitler's birthday.  I guarantee the Germans were doing no such things in Holland in April of 1945.  They were scrambling to get anything they could in preparation to high-tailing it back to Germany first chance.  A Canadian officer allows the SS to execute one of their own officers AFTER the war is over with live ammunition issued to German soldiers.  Seriously??!!!  There are more examples, plus the myriad implausible twists and turns.    I did enjoy the film and will praise Verhoeven on the many things done well.  It's a shame he felt the need to be so over the top with his story line.
B002JVWRAO|3.0|(Some spoilers)<br /><br />Just my luck! I've been watching this show on DVD. I borrowed the first four seasons from the library. The first season was okay (too \\"monster-of-the-week\\" for me) but it got better towards the end, and I loved seasons 2-4. So I decided to support the show and bought season five pretty much blind (didn't want to spoil it) because I loved the show so much. Well, I found this season to be the worst.<br /><br />I really don't know what happened. Did their budget get a huge cut? Did the creator/writers just stop caring? Even the two main actors seemed to be phoning this one in. (Jensen Ackles' super deep manly voice was very distracting and his manly \\"grunt\\" had me laughing out loud during an emotional scene). Frankly, most of this season was painful to watch. After the season four finale where the devil gets set free, you'd think that season five would be awesome. Not really. Lucifer is the most boring character this show has had. Remember how scary the Yellow Eyed Demon and Lilith were? They could eat Lucifer for lunch. And worst of all, Lucifer barely gets any screen time in this season at all. I heard the creator had a five year plan for this show, so I still can't believe how bad year five turned out. Who could plan such a weak ending?<br /><br />Sam and Dean are running around like chickens with their heads cut off. Cas doesn't do much of anything. Bobby hates his life. In this season one ridiculous thing after another happens. We find out that Sam is a vessel for Lucifer and Dean is a vessel for Michael (an archangel who can defeat Lucifer). Really? Can't get any cornier than that. The brothers have the same conversations over and over and over again, moaning about the same things but not really doing much of anything for the whole season. The season finale, Swan Song, is the worst most anti-climatic finale I've seen of any show. There's a lot of questions in this show about where God is in all this (you know, while the Apocalypse is going down and all) and what I got from the finale (and the first episode of season five) is this: God is Deus ex machina! If your favorite character happens to die (as long as it's not a female character, of course) God will just bring them back to life in a snap and everything will go back to normal. Just awful, awful writing for a show that's been so solid for the first four years. It was getting progressively better and better in my opinion, and season five was a huge step backwards. Another thing that bothered me is the complete lack of strong female characters (even evil ones) throughout the whole season (except for one-off appearances in maybe 4 or 5 out of 22 episodes). There wasn't much in terms of action in this season either. The Apocalypse-themed episodes were especially problematic. The whole thing seemed like an after-thought.<br /><br />I'm being way too generous with the three stars here, but there are some episodes I liked/loved this season: Abandon All Hope (thank god for Crowley!), Swap Meat, The Song Remains the Same, and My Bloody Valentine stood out especially for me. Overall, I think I liked/loved less than half the episodes this season. Other episodes were filler and some were just plain awful.<br /><br />I don't have much hope for season six, but it can't be worse than season five, right? At least this show didn't end with Swan Song. It deserves much better than that.at I got from the finale (and the first episode of season five) is this: God is Deus ex machina!

0810988933|4.0|Diary of a Wimpy Kid  By: Jeff Kinney  Diary of a Wimpy Kid is a realistic fiction novel about a boy who will one day become \\"famous\\". The boy keeps a diary, therefore when people ask him about his childhood he can just give them the book instead of having to explain. But for now the main character (Greg Heffley) is stuck in middle school with a bunch of morons. One of my favorite features in this book is that it is illustrated with little cartoons. The book is very relaxing; you can just sit down and have a laugh. This book is for all ages. When I first picked this book up I was about 7 or 8 and when I read it now it still is very interesting. But the very best part is that I can actually relate to Greg. Greg is a scrawny teenager that doesn't have many friends and is not very high on the popularity list. He has a sibling that is usually mean to him. I tried to find other books like this one but never have. This is a one of a kind. I suggest you read it as soon as you can.   -Sebastiao Hungerbuhler
B003PGNBNO|4.0|In 2008, \\"Camp Rock\\" had its premiere on the Disney Channel and at the time, it became the second highest viewed Disney Channel Original Movie behind \\"High School Musical 2' and bringing in 8.9 million viewers.<br /><br />The movie featured the Jonas Brothers and Demi Lovato and the film would catapult the acting and singing careers of both the band and Lovato who would go on to have their own Disney Channel show and for Lovato, would establish herself as a pop star.<br /><br />Needless to say, with the success of the first film, there was no doubt that there would be a sequel and sure enough, in 2010, \\"Camp Rock 2: The Final Jam\\" would air on the Disney Channel on Labor Day weekend and a few days later, would be released on Blu-ray and DVD.  The film is directed by Paul Hoen (\\"Jonas\\", \\"Beyond the Break\\", \\"South of Nowhere\\") and features a screenplay by Daniel Berendsen (\\"Wizards of Waverly Place: The Movie\\", \\"The Cheetah Girls: One World\\", \\"Sabrina, the Teenage Witch\\"), Karen Gist (\\"One Tree Hill\\", \\"Girlfriends\\", \\"Camp Rock\\") and Regina Y. Hicks (\\"Camp Rock\\", \\"Girlfriends\\", \\"Sister, Sister\\").<br /><br />\\"Camp Rock 2 - The Final Jam: Extended Edition\\" features the extended version of the film which includes never-before-seen songs and scenes for \\"Different Summers\\" and \\"Waking in My Shoes\\".<br /><br />VIDEO:<br /><br />\\"Camp Rock 2 - The Final Jam: Extended Edition\\" is presented in 1080p High Definition (1:78:1).  Because the majority of the film is shot outdoors, the film looks vibrant and colorful in HD.  Especially during the performances at the Camp Star stage.  Cinematographer David A Makin (\\"Drop Dead Diva\\", \\"Wizards of Waverly Place: The Movie\\") did a good job in capturing the overall performance area.  The lighting was very well done during these performances and looks great in HD.<br /><br />The accompany DVD is presented in widescreen (1:78:1) - enhanced for 16×9 television.<br /><br />AUDIO & SUBTITLES:<br /><br />\\"Camp Rock 2 - The Final Jam: Extended Edition\\" is presented in English 5.1 DTS-HD Master Audio (48 kHz/24-bit), French 5.1 DTS Digital Surround Sound and Spanish 5.1 Dolby Digital.  Dialogue and music is crisp and clear through the center and front channels and there was a good amount of crowd ambiance coming through the surround channels.  Actually, the lossless soundtrack really takes advantage of the surround channels for this musical.  I was expecting more of a front and center channel driven soundtrack, so I was amazed to hear the surround channels utilized.<br /><br />I actually dig the musical soundtrack for this film compared to the last film.  It's all subjective to the listener but I enjoyed the addition of the pop R&B performances and a good balance of music this time around.<br /><br />The accompanying DVD features a soundtrack in English, French and Spanish 5.1 Dolby Digital.<br /><br />As for subtitles, the film is presented in English SDH, French and Spanish.<br /><br />SPECIAL FEATURES:<br /><br />\\"Camp Rock 2 - The Final Jam: Extended Edition\\" comes with the following special features (in 1080p HD and standard definition and presented in English 5.1 Dolby Digital):<br /><br />  * Rock-Along - While watching the film, you can watch \\"Camp Rock 2 - The Final Jam\\" via \\"Rock-Along\\" in which you can sing along with the tunes (karaoke style titles for the lyrics are shown at the bottom of the screen).<br />  * Music Videos from Camp Rockers Around the World - Watch music videos of performances for \\"Camp Rock 2 - The Final Jam\\" in other countries which include France (3:03, Lea Castel - N'abandone pas (Can't Back Down), Spain (2:47, Lucia Gil - Tu ere mi cancion), Benelux (3:25, Dean en Sita - I Wouldn't Change a Thing), Germany (3:31) and Italy (3:36, FINLEY - Per la vita che verra').  Presented in standard definition.<br />  * Getting to Know the Camp Stars - (5:44) Alyson Stoner interviews Matthew \\"Mdot\\" Finley and Chloe Bridges about how they got the part and what they did in their audition.Also, their experience on filming \\"Camp Rock 2 - The Final Jam\\".<br />  * Disney Live - Download the latest trailers for upcoming Disney films or learn what is out on Disney Blu-ray.<br /><br />EXTRAS:<br /><br />This version of \\"Camp Rock 2 - The Final Jam: Extended Edition\\" comes with a slipcase cover and also comes with a DVD and digital copy of the feature film.<br /><br />JUDGMENT CALL:<br /><br />An awesome, fun and energetic sequel!<br /><br />\\"Camp Rock 2 - The Final Jam: Extended Edition\\" is another enjoyable musical from Disney that stays true to the tradition of the original movie (and other Disney musicals) featuring kids having fun, singing, dancing and of course, you also get some of that camp drama as well.<br /><br />What I enjoyed about the film is that remains consistent to the first but also improves upon the original. Since 2008 with \\"Camp Rock\\", both Demi Lovato and the members of the Jonas Brothers have improved vocally as pop stars. When I first watched Demi Lovato, her vocals worked with her character since she was not as established yet as an actress nor as a singer but now, watching her in \\"Camp Rock 2 - The Final Jam\\", you can see the confidence. Also, I like the pop/R&B addition of  Mathew \\"Mdot\\" Finley.  This guy has star potential and definitely brings another dimension to the \\"Camp Rock\\" music soundtrack.<br /><br />I also enjoyed the choreography for the sequel.  You have awesome choreographers Rosero McCoy (\\"Shake It Up!\\", \\"Step Up\\") and Chuck Maldonado (\\"Stomp the Yard\\" films) really taking the dancing to a new level with this sequel and in fact, when I started to see some stepping during the film, the first thing that came to my mind was \\"Chuck Maldonado\\" must be involved with this film and sure enough he was.<br /><br />A major highlight of the film was the performance by everyone as they were singing the song \\"It's On\\".  It's a very cool song that incorporates everyone into that musical scene and was similar to the \\"High School Musical\\" style of choreography of taking many people and having fun with the choreography but making it slick and cool and having an awesome song behind it. It was great to see everyone so involved and even seeing the main and supporting characters really going all out in the choreography. I was impressed.<br /><br />The pop tracks \\"Fire\\" and \\"Walkin' In My Shoes\\" were also pretty cool and it was good to see Meaghan Martin and Matthew \\"Mdot\\" Finley performing together. I thought the scene with Nate (Nick Jonas) singing to Dana (Chloe Bridges) was pretty charming and fun as Nate is a shy guy but he best communicates through his music.<br /><br />And of course, for Jonas Brothers and Demi Lovato fans, there are plenty of cool songs in this film especially with \\"Wouldn't Change a Thing\\" by Joe Jonas and Demi Lovato as a song that is a solid ballad and awesome follow up to their 2008 \\"Camp Rock\\" hit \\"This Is Me\\".<br /><br />Now which film did I enjoy the most?  I have to say that I enjoyed the first film for its storyline. Mainly for the fact that Mitchie was an underdog and I enjoy films in which the underdog proves that she can be the best.  I enjoyed that about \\"Camp Rock\\" and Demi Lovato's inexperience really helped make her stand out. We hardly knew anything about her then and when we saw her sing, we knew she had star potential. This time around, we have seen Demi emerge as an actress and singer and the same goes for the Jonas Brothers who have matured as well. But when it comes to the music and choreography, \\"Camp Rock 2 - The Final Jam\\" was much better than the original. The songs are catchy, well-produced and the choreography, as mentioned, is much, much better than the original.<br /><br />As for the Blu-ray release, \\"Camp Rock 2 - The Final Jam: Extended Edition\\" does come with the Blu-ray, DVD and a digital copy of the film.  But also, for fans who did enjoy the sequel, the extended version does have the never-before-seen scenes and songs for \\"Different Summers\\" and \\"Walking in My Shoes\\".<br /><br />Although, not a release that comes with a lot of special features and unfortunately no audio commentary or featurettes (would have loved to see the making of or even the training that went into creating the film), it's still a solid release for fans of the film, Demi Lovato, the Jonas Brothers or those who enjoy Disney musicals. Picture and audio quality is solid and I think that fans will love this extended edition Blu-ray release.<br /><br />Overall, \\"Camp Rock 2 - The Final Jam: Extended Edition\\" is another entertaining musical following the success of the original \\"Camp Rock\\" but also improves the film with its music soundtrack and choreography.

0545310601|2.0|This book just wasn't on the same level as the first two.  It dragged, the character development and interactions just weren't the same, and it was just boring.  It felt more like a reality tv show that was being filmed and explained to you, then the third book of the hunger games.  Serious disappointment for me, unfortunately, as I really loved the first two books.
0061537969|5.0|My mom gave me this book to read and I was turned off by the title, then I opened it up and couldn't put it down. I read it in one day. I was laughing and crying. I know some people gave it bad reviews, don't be turned off by those, this story is told from a dog's view and so what if the dog seems to human with his words, whose to say that a dog isn't part human anyway. I won't give a retelling of the story I hate it when people do that. I will, however tell you that if you do read this book make sure you have a box of tissue and your four legged friend by your side.
0765326353|5.0|I am not an author or a true critic, I am just a fan of the genre. I have a library of fantasy books and this book has instanltly found it's way onto my favorites shelf. I am very excited about the future of this series. I only hope that it doesn't actually take a decade to finish writing it.
B00442OI8U|5.0|I really enjoyed the first episode of Chuck season four. It reminded me of the excitement I had watching during seasons one & two. I was not a big fan of season three but I am very hopeful about season four. I hope they don't spoil it! That's all I can say.
B00275EHJG|5.0|Not many times you can say that the third movie is the best, but this movie is so impressive. Has a great story line, funny, graphics are amazing, and at the end, it took effort not to get misty eyed. LOVED IT and so did my 3 1/2 yr old. An awesome movie the whole family can enjoy.
B003JTHESA|5.0|One of the beast albums from Iron Maiden since Bruce Dickinson return. Song by Song the whole album is outstanding.  It mixes the classical style of Iron Maiden with new progressive metal elements.
0316098337|5.0|I don't remember the last time I've been this moved, this enveloped by a book. Like many of the other reviewers, I had a difficult time putting this down once I started, and I thought about the characters during those few moments that I didn't have the book in hand. I'm still thinking about them now that I'm finished, and I expect to be thinking about them for some time.<br /><br />The narration is creative, and utterly believable even when it seems, at the time, nonsensical. I found a thought-provoking observation, conclusion, perspective, interpretation by this child narrator on nearly every page, and this places a lot of demands on the reader. (This is a book that is experienced--multi-sensory--not just passively read.) I cared--and continue to care--deeply for these characters. The description--through a child's eyes--makes the setting vivid, from the colors, to the lighting, to the smells, to the textures.<br /><br />Often, I would re-read a line or a phrase because I could only understand it by reminding myself of what was real to Jack, what made sense to Jack, and in the re-reading, the sense of confusion and dissonance would be resolved, and somehow, this process personalized the book even more. At other times, I would re-read a line or a phrase just to marvel at how well it was written. I'm amazed that the author chose such a brave set of rules to follow--what Jack would know, how he would think, how he would interpret--and on a more microscopic level, what words he would know, and use most often, and confuse. So it's one thing to set these rules but quite another to follow them, and Donoghue does. Faultlessly, I think. She creates a believable world, even when I didn't want it to be believable.<br /><br />I won't recount the plot. This is one of those, the-less-you-know-the-better-books. But I found it very difficult yet important--perspective-changing. I'm grateful for the moments of surprising humor (not many, I would note) and more so for the promises of hope, for the optimism. This book is an experience.ism. This book is an experience.
B00003CXC6|5.0|It's difficult to add much to a film that has been reviewed so many times.  This film, of course, was the inspiration for the Paul Newman Western, 'The Outrage', so if imitation is the highest form of flattery this fascinating film has been flattered plenty.<br /><br />It is redundant to point out that this film tells the tale of a rape and murder told from four separate points of view i.e. 1.  the rapist  2.  the raped woman  3. the murdered husband via a medium and 4. an unseen witness.  All 'testimonies' vary as to the facts and the points of view.  Unlike the 'Outrage', though, the bare 'facts' aren't enormously variable.  The bandit 1. ties up the husband and rapes his beautiful wife in front of his eyes.  2.  The husband ends up dead.  3.  the wife may or may not have put up an initial struggle but sometime during the 'rape' she seems to have passively, if not actively, yielded/participated with her ravisher  4.  The husband, before his death, is appalled/horrified/contemptuous of what has happened to his wife or his wife's pleasure in it.<br /><br />The questions revolve around the details.  Did the wife demand a duel to decide who would get her?  Did she simply insist on her husband's execution?  Did she slay her own husband, herself, unable to take the contempt in his eyes?<br /><br />The questions are subtle enough to gain different interpretations or misinterpretations.  Lie, Truth and simple misinterpretation are explored.  There are no real villains only perpetrators and/or victims.  In one version [the bandit's] the husband comes out as something as a hero, dying manfully in a duel.  Otherwise--at one level or another--all three are at some level complicit.  An interesting film.  It made me think.
B000SX88VW|5.0|While \\"Dark Side\\" and \\"Wish You Were Here\\" were the more popular albums, I always preferred \\"Animals.\\"  Very rarely will you ever hear these songs on the radio, and when I play the song \\"Dogs\\" on my car stereo, my wife looks aghast that there's a song that runs seventeen minutes long.  These aren't 3 minute pop songs.  These are lengthy, aggressive, deep and emotional prog-rock masterpieces built around the bookends \\"Pigs on the Wing (parts 1 & 2)\\"<br /><br />\\"Dogs\\" is my second favorite Pink Floyd song of all time (after \\"Comfortably Numb\\") and features some of the greatest guitar playing I have ever heard from David Gilmour.  The lyrics are biting, with Roger focusing on the backstabbing nature of corporate greed.<br /><br />\\"Pigs (Three Different Ones)\\" attacks the rich and powerful who Roger sees as a danger to society, and particularly, Mary Whitehouse, a british campaigner for morality and decency who had once attacked Pink Floyd's music.<br /><br />\\"Sheep\\" seems to be an attack on those who mindlessly follow their leaders with blind faith.<br /><br />This album is one of Floyd's defining moments, both lyrically and musically.  This is essential Pink Floyd.
0345505387|5.0|I have been a DIE HARD fan of Diana Gabaldons Outlander series for the last 15 years. All it took was reading Outlander once and I was hopelessly addicted. I did not have any concerns that I would dislike the new graphic novel, The Exile. I have only had this book in my possesion for about 3 hours and I have read it through once and flipped through it several times. I absolutely loved it. I really don't understand why so many people are upset about it. I did not expect the entire story again in comic book form and I surely did not want her to rewrite anything. I will continue to wait for the next Outlander novel as well as (I hope) a new graphic novel. Thank you Diana for a wonderful series!
B0040QYROA|5.0|I saw this movie screened in a theater and I was astounded by how big a difference a half an hour makes.<br /><br />Metropolis is the story of a city that allows complete luxury for the wealthy by enslaving the poor. The city founded Joh Fredersen exerts complete control; crossing him means being sent to the depths. His son Freder becomes curious about the men below and he spends time with the workers. He quickly discovers their horrible living conditions, and finds out about a peaceful revolutionary group that meets in the catacombs. Maria leads the meetings where she speaks about a mediator that will come and remedy the division between the wealthy and the poor. Joh finds out about her and encourages a mad scientist to copy her image into the form of a robot. He then uses the robot to control the masses and try to take away their power. Freder fights back.<br /><br />The new footage adds a new dimension to the film. (It is obvious which pieces are new, because they are not restored with the digital restoration process used on the old footage.) We see 11811 galavanting around town to the nightclub where the robot seduces the men. The Thin Man gets more screen time, and he becomes a very memorable character. There is more development in the relationship between Joh and Rotwang too. The biggest difference is the pacing. Before, Metropolis felt like an art film that required a lot of imagination and interpretation. Now, it is a complete silent film experience. The message is clearly explained and the story is fully developed.<br /><br />Horray for the new Metropolis!

B0017ZUXAY|3.0|If this were released as a live album only, it would rank much higher in the Pink Floyd catalogue.  But since it's attached to what is (arguably) the worst Pink Floyd studio album, it sits on the bottom of my list.<br /><br />As a collector of numerous PF bootlegs, there are far superior live versions of the songs presented here.  \\"Live at the Electric Factory\\" and \\"Interstellar Encore\\" are two good examples of the same material being performed.  \\"A Saucerful of Secrets\\" for example, is truncated to only 12 minutes on \\"UmmaGumma\\", but the typical length on most bootlegs is 20 minutes.  Had Pink Floyd just released a double album of live material, then we would have really had something here.<br /><br />The studio album isn't a total disaster, though.  \\"Granchester Meadows\\" is a nice little acoustic Roger Waters ballad, and \\"The Narrow Way\\" has some good moments.  Unfortunately, the rest is practically unlistenable.
0547258305|3.0|this book took me forever to get into. I enjoyed the read once I did get into it though.
0545310601|4.0|Suzanne Collins captivated me with \\"The Hunger Games\\", and \\"Catching Fire\\" was absolutely as powerful.  Reading them, I just couldn't stop; and somehow it seemed like a great adventure.  Sure, awful things happened, but all's well that ends well, right?  The horror of it didn't touch me.    \\"Mockingjay\\" is as captivating as the first two books, but the glamorous mask is gone.  Katniss, having survived two Hunger Games, is brought face-to-face with real war, with herself as the face of the revolution, and her ordeal is just plain ugly.  I found it as hard to stop reading as the first books, but was left just feeling raw.  It's a powerful story, no question.  It's very well written.  It's even a fitting conclusion to the trilogy.  And it's brilliance is horrible.
B000MRAAJM|4.0|Some may use 'Avatar' to demonstrate the power of their Hi-def players, but this is my weapon of choice. Nature has always been full of wonders, but never presented in such an epic and wide scale; from the vast plains to the tiniest cul-de-sacs, every neighborhood of earth is beautifuly presented.  While not always presented in Hi-definition, this is akin to limits in technology due to some of the extreme environments they shot in, and consists of maybe 10 percent of the footage. The rest is richly detailed, and at times, jaw-dropping.  Aided much by David Attenburrough's wonderful narration, this unforgettable series highlights the inherent mystery, beauty, tragedy, and peril of this unique world of ours. My top episode picks would have to be \\"Tropical Rainforests\\" and \\"Shallow Seas\\".
B003TXKSWK|5.0|Awesome drumming earns this album a \\"5\\" on its own. Great tunes, great singing, and a few inspired rhymes here and there along with some heartfelt social and political messages make for an excellent album. The Roots have always been an awesome band, and it is neat to have them in an environment like this where their jamming can really shine.

4789009637|5.0|If you're serious about wanting to learn Japanese, the Genki series is the best.  I honestly recommend the workbook over the textbook but together they are a lethal combination.  I am serious! GET THIS.  I had primitive japanese skill that was limited to a few memorized coin phrases.  I took a class, where this and the workbook were my study aides, and worked relentlessly to finish the workbook, erased all my answers and did it again, and again (which is why I recommend the workbook).  Then I went and spent 3 months in Osaka.  When I got to Osaka, I had a really good understanding of Japanese Grammar, and an alright vocabulary, only I'd not had much experiencing really using the language.  By the time I left Osaka (90 days later) I was to the point of being able to walk into a shot bar/club/handmade crafts store and have a fun filled/deep/entertaining conversation with anyone there.  My jump was insane, and it was because of the genki series.      You know how people talk about male enhancers on late night infomercials?  \\"I cannot believe the results!  Amazing!\\"  that's how I feel about genki.  buy the text used and the workbook new.  Use a pencil to write in, so you can erase and go over it again.    Once you feel like you've really devoured (and I mean you picked the crumbs out of the couch cushion too) genki I, move onto the genki II books.    hope this helps you save a little money and time on the way to experiencing one of the most beautiful cultures in the world.
B001N1DPDE|5.0|Pro: Sharp, sturdy, easy care, thick blade for baton splitting infinitely useful.  Cons: Sheathe is floppy, handle is slippery and thick    Ive used a Becker BK2 a friend had while camping for the past few years and finally picked up one for myself. It is heavy, which will bother some people for backpacking, but the weight helps with baton splitting and hacking through smaller trees and branches. The handle is smooth and gets slippery with sweaty or muddy hands. I'm the type to modify my equipment to suit my use anyway, so I have solved this with a nice tight wrap of the sheathe from paracord. This knife came sharp enough to shave with from the belly of the blade forward. Further down toward the grip the blade is sharp but not shaving sharp. There's a lanyard hole at the back of the grip through which i've put a small length of paracord to secure around my wrist. The sheathe tends to flop around and if the grip strap isn't snapped closed it will swing and flop around badly. Good way to overcome this is to place either a nylon strap though the wider slots on the sheathe to wrap around your leg, or good old paracord to do the same.
0307276902|4.0|I agree with all the people who are criticizing this book because it does such a ridiculous job of explaining addiction treatment and it could frighten someone away from trying. However, it is the old adage, \\"How can you tell when an addict is lying?  His lips are moving.\\" Or, in this case, his fingers on the keyboard.  Read this with a grain of salt. It is fictionalized. However, underneath everything I found some good explanations of the feelings involved in addiction.   It is impossible for \\"normies\\" to understand addiction but this book offered some helpful insight. It is considered heresy to criticize AA, but their program is very difficult to accept for a lot of people. Saying, \\"You will never stay sober without working the steps,\\" just doesn't help. I can understand Frey's frustrations, and there should be ways to address them, not just dismiss them.  For another description of the insanity of the disease, and a more accurate view of treatment, see Moyer's \\"Broken.\\"
B002N5N5LG|5.0|So let me start off by saying that I am a huge fan of NBC's Thursday night comedy block. I am a huge fan of 30 Rock and The Office, even if both shows are losing it a little bit for me. And I am very pleased to have a near perfect fun fresh comedy come bring some freshness to the block. But im going to be completely honest, I hated this show when it first came on. Admittingly I only watched the first episode when it first came but out I flat out didn't like it. I just didn't see anything funny about it. But when i knew that the second season was coming up I put the whole first season on Netflix so i could catch up and BOY AM I GLAD I DID!!!! This is without a DOUBT the best show on NBC's Thursday night line up. Every single moment and every single character on this show is magical. I haven't been so excited about a new show since Glee came out. This show is definitely one of my all time favorite shows now. Im not afraid to say its perfect. There is not a single bad episode, and every one provides non stop witty humor. Also the last minute or two during the end credits with the characters Abed and Troy and hysterical!!! Best two minutes of my life! lol ^_^  So if your a fan of comedy or just good television in general you MUST watch this show and ensure it gets to stay on the air as long as possible!
0786955554|3.0|My 1st biggest disappointment with this box set is that it needed about double the number of sheets.  There's 10 sheets and they are double-sided, but most of the \\"other\\" side aren't very imaginative.  In fact, most of them are plain cement tiles.  There are some cool useful tiles, but only one of each.  Such as a bookshelf that's 2x4 but there's only 1 tile like this.  There should have been more doubles of these kind of tiles.  There's a web that's 2x2 but only 1 again.  Really disappointing.  There definitely should have been twice this many sheets.<br /><br />So if you've got nothing else to decorate your mat this is a good start but if you've already got plenty of decorative tiles you should pass on this.
B00003CX5P|3.0|I remember all the hype leading up to the theatrical release of this movie and after 16 years of waiting, the prequels had finally arrived.  I had my doubts from seeing the trailers which didn't look that good, and I should have known from what went wrong with much of Return of the Jedi that it would translate over to these new movies.  The first two Star Wars movies were so effective partially because George Lucas was not given as much autonomy which in reality made the movies so much better.  If you have seen the earlier scripts for Star Wars you would see how silly some of his ideas were.  With Return of the Jedi, George Lucas was free to do whatever he wanted, and his silliness and eccentricities were poured forth strongly within Jabba's palace and the whole Ewok thing.  So after such a long wait, the Phantom Menace arrives.  I was very anxious to see it, but I had my doubts.  Afterward, I did enjoy it, but there were many things I did not like about it.  The story in many ways contradicts the information that we did know about Anakin that Obi-Wan explained to Luke in ROTJ: \\"When I met your father he was already a great pilot (not a podracer).  I was amazed how strong he was in the force...I took it upon myself to train him...I was not as good as Yoda was\\" etc.  So I really had a problem with Anakin being as young as he was.  I always imagined Anakin being around Luke's age in the first movie, but more of a Han Solo type in his humor and recklessness; yet noble, but with a dark side with his temper and stubbornness.  His character would be likeable and he would seem like one of those guys you would love to have around (thus making his future fall that much more tragic).  The story of Padme being the elected Queen of Naboo at age 16 was ridiculous; her costume was plain silly.  I see her story taking place on Alderaan, as a princess of the ruling family that was close to Bail Organa.  There was a lot of time wasted in this movie with stories that did not matter to the saga as a whole:  Jar Jar Binks and the Gungans, the fish chasing the ship, the Gungan battle, etc.  I really think that a lot of this frivolous storyline could have been eliminated and elements of Episode II incorporated into it so we could see more of the Clone Wars in the next movie.  Lucas wasted too much time and as a result we are stuck watching cartoons to see more of a sensationalized version of the Clone Wars.  The Jedi Council was ridiculous with all of its bizarre creatures (like the thing with the long neck) and Yoda's insistence that he sees anger and fear in Anakin but it is not substantiated.  I don't like Anakin and his mother being slaves and there should have had a connection with the Lars family right away (and sincere disagreement from Owen Lars with Anakin being involved with the Jedi, etc).  The Podrace was cool, but I think a skyhopper race would have been more appropriate and Qui-Gon and Obi-Wan could have felt how strong Anakin was in the force right away while descending upon the planet and chancing upon the race.  Elements of Episode II could have been incorporated with Mace Windu doing (Obi-Wan's) investigation into the cloning facility.  The entire trade federation battle was a waste and there could have been a better way to incorporate Anakin as a pilot without doing a shoddy remake of the first attack on the Death Star.  The movie is full of annoying characters: the Gungans, the Trade Federation and the battle droids, Watto, Padme's advisors, etc.  I would have scrapped about 70% of this movie.  The midi-Chlorian concept should have been trashed as well.  C3PO and R2-D2 were always intended to be in all of the movies, but I don't like the idea of Anakin being the one that created C3PO - it just doesn't fit.  The only bright spot to the movie is Darth Maul and the lightsaber battles which are spectacular.  I believe he should have lived in order to establish Anakin's skills in the next movie by Anakin defeating him, but underestimating Dooku who surprises him and dismembers him before escaping.      In retrospect I think \\"The Phantom Menace\\" is a failure and George Lucas really messed up this movie and forever contradicted the original storyline.  It's sad that the man that started such an amazing universe sabotaged his own creation including his constant tinkering with the original trilogy.  There are too many gratuitous references to the classic trilogy that don't belong in the movie; I think George Lucas got lost in his own universe and really missed the mark.  I'd love to see someone do a remake and really do the prequels some justice.  There are plently of graphic novels and books that do George Lucas' universe more justice than the man himself.

0060555661|5.0|I have read many books on investing and many aspects of it.  This is by far the best and Graham takes a step by step approach when explaining his views.  This particular edition is revised and includes newer, more relevant topics.  However we can learn a great deal from the past.  The market is the most unpredictable thing you can imagine so there is no need to falsely assume that through reading of any book we can predict the future.  Everyone is bound to make mistakes but we can adequately avoid bigger issues through the understanding of the past.    Highly Recommend this book for anyone, whether you are a novice or a professional.  Another great book to read for those starting out is One Up One Down on Wall Street by Peter Lynch.
190302563X|2.0|have to admit, Jane Austen's Persuasion was just . . . pretty boring. The book mainly consists of the main character, Anne Elliot, hanging about until finally realizing that the man she really wants is a sailor whose love she turned away several years ago. Anne herself is not particularly interesting, nor are there the really fun, memorable characters like the father in Emma. The only dramatic incident in the book is one of Anne's acquaintances taking a tumble and bumping her head, but she's not really hurt and the whole incident is designed to help dispose of one of Anne's potential suitors. In six months I'll have completely forgotten what this book is about, but I will say it offers an interesting historical look at what daily life might be like in the lower-echelons of the the English gentry. It also demonstrates the high regard that Englishmen held for the navy as one of the few avenues for citizens of mundane birth to advance themselves into positions of power, wealth, and prestige.    For essays, John Wiltshire's \\"Modern Interpretations\\" discusses how, although the slow-moving and even mournful Persuasion was Austen's final published novel, she was working on a \\"high-spirited satire\\" at the time of her death. Wiltshire also talks about a couple of recent filmed versions of the book. Maggie Lane's \\"Regency Life\\" has an interesting discussion on the role of the navy during the period in which Austen was writing, as well as the use of seaside resorts as places visited for both recreation and their supposed medicinal effects. Caroline Sanderson's \\"Geographical Settings\\" focusses primarily on Bath and Lyme Regis, while Josephine Ross' \\"A Modern Perspective\\" offers an interesting portrait of Jane Austen's own failed romantic pursuits and how that may have influenced her writing.

0784010501|5.0|The title of this review might seem a little bit over the top, but seen now (19 years later) it definitely has become the most clear document of the influence Madonna has had on modern pop music and culture in general (fashion to just mention one thing - with the Gaultier cone bras and the signature fake pony tail), especially during the last decade of the 20th Century (which was her golden age) and marked the tone of what wannabe divas had to follow to be successful. But once they started to follow her steps she did not stay the same and shifted shapes in front of our very eyes. I am sure this movie has a lot fewer candid shots into the backstage world of her Blonde ambition tour than what she wanted the public to believe. Madonna likes to control eveything and I am sure she calculated a lot of how she behaved and what she said in the film. But it does not matter, because that is what her on-stage persona is and what has made her one of the greatest artists of our generation. I like the definition she gives of herself in one of the scenes: \\"I know I am not the best dancer or singer, but my mission is to push people's buttons and to make them think\\". She also says in one segment (talking to the press in Italy, about the controversy with the Catholic Church and her performance and use of Catholic symbols): \\"My show is not like any other rock show, is a theatrical performance...I do not endorse a way of life I represent it on stage...the public is left to make their own conclusions about what they see\\". She probably was not the first artist to be outrageous and not afraid of testing our comfort level, but nobody else took it to this level of spectacle and nobody has managed to stay in command of her own artistic decisions and also to remain current even after almost 30 years. I will probably seem ancient (even though I am only 34) but the kids who now have Lady Gaga as their queen (who, BTW, I consider the legitimate heir to Madonna's throne...though not yet!) should take a look at this documentary to confirm what \\"old\\" people like me are constantly saying: Gaga did not invent the \\"outrageous hypersexualized super fashionable diva style\\", that is all Madonna!, and this documentary is the proof. We need a DVD/Bluray rerelease of this and all of her old tour videos ASAP!!.take a look at this documentary to confirm what \\"old\\" people like me are constantly saying: Gaga did not invent the \\"outrageous hypersexualized super fashionable diva style\\", that is all Madonna!, and this documentary is the proof.

B001GZ6QEC|4.0|Boy, do we love melodrama! Great story, great performances, great action pieces! I wish Batman didn't talk in a growling hush, it got tired after awhile. This film is over-bearing melodrama with many great ideas that are pounded into our brain for almost 2 and half hours. Nolan has taken the humour, the colour, the fun out of the previous Batman movie series, maybe that's why it's called The Dark Knight. I personally have a love and hate relationship with this movie; where I see intelligence I also see the sign of our times; it's over-done and I mean over-done!!! We live in a time where a generation will call musicals like 'An American In Paris', corny. I say melodrama like in the film The Dark Knight and others like it, is extremely corny, albeit entertaining. Sometimes we over-do things in this generation and this is the way I feel about this film. In the end I do recommend it because my taste is only a small reflection of the hard work and imagination put into the film and this blu-ray version offers great image and audio.

B000P0J06U|5.0|In 1992 some silly, so-called Christian organization threw a bullying hissy fit at McDonalds for its Happy Meal deal tie-in with Tim Burton`s Batman Returns. McDonalds, true to form, prematurely withdrew its merchandising. Rumor has it that McDonalds issued a stern warning to Warner Brothers not to tap Burton for the next Batman film. For whatever reason, Warner Brothers caved into the golden arch and ,consequently, put its franchise into a decade long grave with the unwise hiring of director Joel Schumacher.<br /><br />Only the fundamentalist mindset can associate Big Macs with a certain brand of morality. Looking at Batman Returns (1992), one wonders what the Christian organization was complaining about. The Bible is all throughout the film and, actually the good book itself has far more sex and violence than Batman, Tim Burton, Warner Brothers and McDonalds combined.<br /><br />Regardless, Batman Returns remains the greatest cinematic comic book movie to date and one of Tim Burton's most uniquely accomplished films. Admittedly, I am not a fan of comic book movies, even if I did read comics some when I was kid, but then most kids I knew did. I was in the minority in preferring DC to Marvel, and I guess I am sort of looking forward to the new Green Lantern movie, mainly because the Green Lantern/Green Arrow comic was a favorite when I was a wee lad in the 1960s and 1970s. That was a comic that was delightfully of its time, a bit like Star Trek in espousing an ultra-liberal message with all the subtlety of a pair of brass knuckles. Even though Green Lantern himself was a bit too righteous and bland, I liked that he was obsessed with the color green and was rendered impotent by the color yellow. There was something surreal in that, and I find the insistence of realism in comics to be a huge oxymoron. Perhaps that's why the dark surrealism of Batman Returns did not bother me like it did mainstream audiences, comic book geeks, and militant pseudo-Christian organizations.<br /><br />Even though I will acknowledge that Christopher Nolan`s Dark Knight (2008) was well crafted, it would not have worked without Ledger's performance holding it together. Christian Bale's Bruce Wayne, however, pales compared to Michael Keaton's much more intense, internalized, subtle and complex Wayne. Finally, Nolan's film feels like it has one subplot too many. Comparatively, Tim Burton's Batman Returns is a genuine freak show, which is as it should be. This is the Dark Knight filtered through a young Tim Burton still channeling the influence of Tod Browning. It is an inimitable, energetically enthusiastic film which revels in its weirdness with a style and texture all its own.<br /><br />The deformed Penguin is born to rich parents (Paul Reubens and Diane Salinger, both of 1985's Pee Wee's Big Adventure) who dispose of him in the sewer like Moses being dumped in the Nile (choreographed to composer Danny Elfman's wordless choral music). Penguins and circus performers rescue their potential deliverer, and the saga begins 33 years later (Christ allegory there). Characteristically, Burton propels us into a yuletide world, only this is a season as envisioned by the Ghost of Christmas Yet To Come in the expressionist land of silent film forefathers. Fritz Lang, Guy Maddin and Jack Skellington know this Gotham.<br /><br />Christopher Walken emerges as the beautifully ludicrous-wigged energy tycoon Max Schreck (named after the actor who played Count Orlock--AKA Dracula--in F.W. Murnau's Nosferatu). Schreck lives in his Metropolis-inspired ivory tower and emerges to give a holiday speech to the crowd below. The infamous Circus Gang interrupts the proceedings via a giant Christmas present which literally rolls into the town square, shooting forth clowns on motorcycles, strongmen, fire eating jesters, and a machine gun wielding monkey.<br /><br />Commissioner Gordon (Pat Hingle) turns on the Bat Signal not a moment too soon, because Bruce Wayne (Michael Keaton) is alone in his mansion, getting ready to turn on \\"Blue Christmas.\\" Batman saves Schreck's secretary, Selena Kyle (Michelle Pfeifer), from a killer clown with a tazer, but Schreck is nowhere to be found. That's because he has unwittingly stumbled upon the underground sewer abode of the legendary Penguin Man (Danny DeVito). The Penguin's lair looks like a cross between the Phantom of the Opera's cavern and Vincent Price`s Theater of Blood (1973).<br /><br />This is not Burgess Meredith's Penguin (taking nothing from Meredith). Devito's Penguin is, by turns, empathetic, repulsive and genuinely threatening. With Schreck's help (via blackmail) Penguin intends to ascend to the world above, locate his parents (already dead, probably by the Penguin's hands) and take over Gotham as the new mayor. He also has a secret plan of revenge against the whole of Gotham by killing every first born male child (shades of Ramses and King Herod). Meanwhile, Schreck \\"kills\\" Selena by pushing her out a window after she stumbles upon some hidden files. However, Selena is revived by flesh-eating kitty cats. She returns to her Barbie doll apartment, turns \\"Hello There\\" into \\"Hell Here\\", fashions a black leather cat suit on an old sewing machine, and Catwoman is born.<br /><br />Pfeifer, who can often be stoic, is amazing here. It is the best performance of her career and she is full of surprises. Like Penguin, she arouses empathy and she arouses Batman/Bruce Wayne as well. Not only is Wayne sexually attracted to her, but he senses a truly kindred spirit. In the first Batman (1989) Wayne's romantic relationship seemed a mismatch but here Wayne's falling in love with Selena/Catwoman is natural and understandable. You really want them to make it, although you know it is, as Catwoman predicts, \\"not a fairy tale to be.\\"<br /><br />Even the loathsome Schreck has a degree of empathy in his love for his son, which leaves us the character of Batman. Here, Keaton's Wayne is not saddled with the unfolding of his origin story, as he was in the previous film. Oddly, many critics of the first film commented that Keaton's performance paled next to the extroverted Jack Nicholson. Seen today, Nicholson's performance seems obvious while Keaton's has grown considerably in stature. Keaton's Batman is the eye of the hurricane. In Returns, Wayne's inner angst is already firmly established. Here, he suffers more from restlessness, lack of direction, his inability to connect, boredom, intense loneliness, and seasonal blues, which makes his unease with the world much more vivid. In the guise of Batman, Wayne is not above igniting one opponent and blowing up another (in fact he clearly enjoys it), all while lecturing Selena for wanting to kill Schreck. Keaton does not resort to a tried and true lazy playboy act. It is very apparent to all that Bruce Wayne is as disturbed as Batman. Batman/Bruce Wayne fully fits in this quartet of freaks.<br /><br />When his collaboration with Schreck predictably sours, Penguin, with the help of rocket launching penguins and a henchman who must have taken kidnapping lessons from Robert Helpmann's Child Catcher in Chitty Chitty Bang Bang (1968), ignites his plan to mass murder the children.<br /><br />The scene in which Selena and Wayne find out the truth about one another is well done and probably is the only time this plot element has worked in any comic book film (the uncovering of the `secret identity' did not work at all in the first Batman film, in Superman, or in the Spider-Man film). The boat ride in the sewer recalls Phantom of the Opera (1925), and the unmasking of Batman in front of Selena echoes Lon Chaney and Mary Philbin. Despite Penguin's terrible plans, his fate is a sad one.<br /><br />Batman Returns erupts in a dizzying apocalypse straight from the theater of the absurd. This is a superhero burlesque as only Tim Burton, at this stage in his career, could have delivered. At the center of this burlesque are freaks we care about; only they are not really freaks, and the film ends with a bit of sad reflection and an urge to turn on \\"Blue Christmas.\\"<br /><br />* MY REVIEW WAS ORIGINALLY PUBLISHED AT 366 WEIRD MOVIEScs of the first film commented that Keaton's performance paled next to the extroverted Jack Nicholson.

At the center of this burlesque are freaks we care about; only they are not really freaks, and the film ends with a bit of sad reflection and an urge to turnon \\"Blue Christmas.\\"    * MY REVIEW WAS ORIGINALLY PUBLISHED AT 366 WEIRD MOVIES
B0007TKNKG|5.0|I was 14 when this movie came out. I can remember \\"Meet Me Halfway\\" being enormously popular and hearing it all the time. Just saw the movie again recently for the first time in a long time and it's as good as I remembered, if not better. Brings back lots of memories!
B0000VD04M|4.0|In 1980 , two years after Ed Wood`s alcohol related death at 54, film critic Michael Medved and his brother published \\"The Golden Turkey Awards\\" and gave Wood the award of being \\"The Worst Director of All Time\\" and naming his film Plan 9 From Outer Space  \\"The Worst Film of All Time.\\"  The forever constipated Mr. Medved must had the biggest bowel movement of his life when he discovered that he and his brother unintentionally put the wheels in motion for the cult celebrity status of Wood who, to Medved, was little more than an object of derision.<br /><br />Quite simply, Ed Wood was an outsider artist, whose medium was film.  He managed to create two highly personalized \\"masterpieces\\" of naive surrealism; Glen or Glenda (1953) and Plan 9 From Outer Space (1959) with \\"star\\" Bela Lugosi, who was clearly at the end of his tether.<br /><br />In between these two films Wood made Bride of the Monster (1955) , also starring Lugosi (the only one of the three Wood films in which Lugosi actually `starred'), but that film was more of a concession to the genre and lacked the pronounced Woodian weirdness found in either Glen or Glenda or Plan 9 From Outer Space.<br /><br />Fourteen years after Wood's cult status rocketed out of the pages of Medved's book, Tim Burton produced his valentine to Eddie.  Clearly, Ed Wood was as personal a film for Burton as Glen and Plan 9 had been for Wood.  Burton faced immense difficulty in mounting the project and was given what, for him, was a small budget.  Artistically, the endeavor paid off and even did so financially, in time, although it took Touchstone years to realize the film's cult potential for the DVD market.<br /><br />In 1994 Tim Burton was the perfect artist to bring Ed's story to the screen.  Burton, recognizing a fellow auteur and genuine oddball, treated Wood, not with derision, but with the respect he deserved.  Before Ed Wood, Burton, although trained at Disney, was still an outsider with Hollywood backing, which makes him (in that regard) a kindred spirit to Stanley Kubrick.  Burton's first big budget feature effort had been Pee Wee's Big Adventure (1985), a zany Caligari-esque journey in craoyla colors.  The success of that film lead to bigger successes. Beetlejuice (1988) and the epic Batman (1989) followed.  Both of those films starred Burton's greatest collaborator, Michael Keaton.  Edward Sissorhands (1990) was a beautifully elegiac, quirky, flawed film.  It was also Burton's first film with future collaborator Johnny Depp.  Batman Returns  (1992) was a more personal vision of the Dark Knight in which Charles Dickens yuletide season goes straight to a superhero burlesque hell.  That film remains, to this day, the greatest film incarnation of a comic book character.<br /><br />Of course, Ed Wood followed, but something happened to Burton after this film. Mars Attacks (1996) was Burton's attempt to make an Ed Wood-like film, but he didn't learn the George Stevens lesson.  Steven had made his Greatest Story Ever Told (1965) and it is one the most frustrating misfires in cinema history, featuring a sublime performance from Max Von Sydow as Christ and a damned fine one from the much put upon Charlton Heston as the Baptist.  These performances and the cinematography (Lloyd Griggs and William Mellor) are sabotaged by Stevens decision to insert cameos from a plethora of big named stars, such as John Wayne as a roman soldier.  Stevens defended this marketing decision by claiming that \\"no one will notice in twenty years.\\"  It's been over forty years and it is still a blatantly distracting example in which marketing trumps art.  Burton repeated this mistake, treated Woodian weirdness like the Bible, and it was a major distraction.  Audiences and critics responded coolly.<br /><br />After that, Burton's genuine penchant for weirdness was sacrificed for tinseled weirdness, not only apparent in all the films which have followed, but also in his personal and aesthetic preferences.  Helena Bonham Carter and Johnny Depp are hopelessly polished when compared to the likes of genuine, internalized eccentrics such as Paul Reubens, Lisa Marie and Michael Keaton.  Depp's current, most popular work may well be with Burton, but his best work remains with other directors, such as Jim Jarmusch in Dead Man (1995) and Sally Potter in The Man Who Cried (2000).  Those two directors were able to draw much more wistful, more nuanced, fully fleshed out performances from Depp.  Under Burton, Depp has become far too grandiose and obvious.<br /><br />This was not yet the case when the two collaborated for Ed Wood. The renegade spirit was still in full force and Burton had the cast, crew and enthusiasm to do it justice.  Much has been written about Martin Landau's performance, and the accolades are deserving.  Landau had done prior excellent character work in Francis Ford Coppola's Tucker (1988) and Woody Allen`s Crimes and Misdemeanors (1989), both of which garnered him Academy Award nominations.  Landau would top both of these films, giving the performance of his life, as Lugosi in Ed Wood.  Even the Academy realized it and finally honored Landau's work.<br /><br />Bill Murray as Bunny Breckenridge, Patricia Arquette as Kathy Wood, Jeffrey Jones as Criswell, Mike Starr as Georgie Weiss, Lisa Marie as Vampira, George Steele as Tor Johnson, and Juliette Landau as Loretta King are equally superb and followed Burton, Depp and Landau's lead in giving the freaks full dignity due.  Even the casting of Sarah Jessica Parker works since the actress proved to be just as witless, over-inflated and annoying as her character, Delores Fuller.<br /><br />The film itself is, naturally, a mix of fact and fiction.  Wisely, Burton does not cover Wood's films preceeding and following Lugosi, because Ed Wood is about Ed's relationships with his fellow misfits.  The world they share together is as unique and special to them as the island of misfit toys is to a Charlie in the Box.  Even Parker, as Delores, realizes it and tells Eddie, \\"This is not the real world. You have surrounded yourself with a gang of misfits and dope addicts.\\"  She is right, of course and, thankfully, banishes herself from the Woodian universe to forever disappear in that thick as peanut butter fog of deserved suburban obscurity.<br /><br />Wood and the Plan 9 company did get baptized in a Baptist church to pacify Wood's religious backers, they did steal the rubber octopus for Bride of the Monster, and they did forget to steal the motor.  However, Ed's with meeting Orson Welles, his idol, never happened, but it is a hilarious, well done scene.  Unlike the movie, Lugosi's funeral was actually well attended ( secretly paid for by Frank Sinatra), but these are really inconsequential points.  With Ed Wood, Tim Burton cemented the legend of a fellow misfit and only Burton, in that time and place, could do it.<br /><br />Half a century has passed since the premiere of Plan 9 From Outer Space and we are still discussing it and its creator.  That is for a reason.  Countless bad movies have come, gone, and remain forgotten.  There is nothing special about a bad movie, unless it is full of personality.  Ed Wood briefly was able to inject himself into a few special films, before he began to drown in his rejection.  With Plan 9 From outer Space and Glen or Glenda, Ed Wood and his art are totally inseparable.  Ed Wood's films are art.  Attempted descriptions such as \\"bad\\", \\"good\\", \\" camp\\", \\"unintentional\\" are rendered superfluous, and this is how it should be, because Ed Wood forces his audience into a completely subjective experience.  Tim Burton pays Wood the highest compliment by following suit.  Ed Wood Jr. will be remembered long after the successful and bland Ron Howards of this world are forgotten.<br /><br />Tim Burton will be remembered, as well, for that period--the time of  Burton's most honest and individual films--in which he still was able to connect with the misfits and had the ability and clout to make Hollywood and audiences connect as well.  Later, he dropped the Ed Wood ball forever.  Tim Burton is no longer a misfit, a renegade spirit, or a visionary.  Today, he would not recognize or bond with Edward D. Wood, Jr.  Ed Wood was Tim Burton's actual swansong and, although a box office disappointment, it  too will be remembered long after Burton's \\"more successful\\" films  have vanished.  Undoubtedly,  Burton will continue to make a plethora of commercial successes; and even if it seems he shot his final wad with Ed Wood, that is still is far more than many ever get the opportunity to do.<br /><br />* MY REVIEW WAS ORIGINALLY PUBLISHED AT 366 WEIRD MOVIESsurrounded yourself with a gang of misfits and dope addicts.\\"  She is right, of course and, thankfully, banishes herself from the Woodian universe to forever disappear in that thick as peanut butter fog of deserved suburban obscurity.

B003U0AHBO|3.0|I enjoyed this battle epic, with its more realistic views of King John and the political situations.  If it hadn't been called Robin Hood, I think I'd have given it four stars.    But to use the name of a famous legend, and have so little in common with the actual/legendary story of Robin Hood smacks of exploitation. If you're not making a Robin Hood movie, why call it Robin Hood, except for the name recognition that might drag more people into the theater?    Apart from that, the intrigue was good, the secondary characters maybe a bit flat and dull, and the battle scenes were long, detailed and violent, if you like that sort of thing.  How historically accurate was it?  I have no idea. I'm pretty sure Robin Hood's dad didn't write the Magna Carta.    Though some have objected to Marian's getting into armor and fighting as anachronistic, I for one enjoyed seeing it.  Seriously, how realistic do you think any of this Hollywood stuff is?  A woman in armor is no more unlikely than the rest of the story.
B00005JKQ6|5.0|When Burt Lancaster began his career as an actor, it appeared this was going to be a career in the mold of Errol Flynn or Randolph Scott. In films like The Flame and the Arrow, Jim Thorpe-All American, The Crimson Pirate, Vera Cruz, Ten Tall Men, From Here to Eternity, The Kentuckian, Trapeze, Gunfight at the OK Corral, and Run Silent, Run Deep, Lancaster seemed to personify and embody the American ideal hero.<br /><br />However, behind those swell guy teeth and that brandished chest was a shrewd actor, who, as he seasoned, made increasingly interesting choices.  In the second half of his career, Lancaster often played off that earlier, heroic persona with admirable risk taking.  If  Elmer Gantry and Seven Days in May might be aptly described as loudly presenting the dirty underbelly of Americana, then The Swimmer intimately one-ups them.<br /><br />In 1968 director Frank Perry with writer/wife Eleanor Perry adapted John Cheever's acclaimed allegorical New Yorker short story, The Swimmer, and brilliantly cast the iconic Burt Lancaster as the pathetic hero.  The Perrys had previously teamed for the equally disturbing David and Lisa (1962) and made quite a splash on the art film circuit.  Surprisingly, that film even garnered a couple of Academy Award nominations, which enabled the team to make The Swimmer.<br /><br />The Swimmer begins on an absurdly bright, sunny day.  Ned (Lancaster), the epitome of a tanned, virile, soulless suburbia, decides he is going to enthusiastically embark on a strange, epic, connect-the-dot journey by \\"swimming\\" home through the neighborhood swimming pools. He takes along a nubile girl (Janet Langard), but at each pool he encounters facets of his failed life and the crack in his facade slowly begins to expand until the inevitable, tragic conclusion.  The physical reality of The Swimmer (a day in Ned's life) is mere allegory and the allegorical symbolism of Ned's entire life which is, in fact, the physical realm into which we are drawn.<br /><br />Lancaster, the sex symbol, is perfection as he superficially pats his neighbors on the back, encounters a discarded mistress, is confronted by his numerous lies, his betrayals, his failure as a husband, father, friend and neighbor.  By the time he reaches his own home, his paradigm has altered from cartoon sunshine and forced, surface smiles to despairing rain.  When he reaches his porch, he is vulnerable to all the elements which mercilessly come down upon him in all forms, including nature itself.  Ned has ultimately realized his hollow state.<br /><br />Impressively, The Swimmer has a dreamlike, short story, episodic pacing, not at all what is expected in the medium of film, and this adds to its uniqueness.  The Swimmer, fragile indeed in its quite odd structure, is a case where casting really counted.  It would not have worked without its star.  Unfortunately, The Swimmer is out of print and even when it was briefly available, Columbia disrespectfully released it an a cheapo presentation.<br /><br />* my review was originally published at 366 weird moviesol, is perfection as he superficially pats his neighbors on the back, encounters a discarded mistress, is confronted by his numerous lies, his betrayals, his failure as a husband, father, friend and neighbor.

B000LTAY1U|5.0|I am a very picky person when it comes to watches, it took me days to find the right watch but i finally did with this seiko military style watch. it is a very simple watch yet still has a fancy look to it. it's quiet to the point i can sleep with it on, unlike some of my other waches that are battery operated with a very very loud thick that does not let you sleep. I have yet to dive underwater with it. the rating said 30 meters but i dont want to take a chance. Over all i am very satisfied with the watch good size weight and color. the strap could have been a little wider but in the end it's something you can overlook I would recomend this watch if you want a military look yet fancy and classy to say the least.  Here I am more than a year later with the same watch wearing it vertually everyday even at work installing fire alarms, This watch is amazing how good it handles the abuse. the glas hardly has any scratches I dont even know with my line of work. At the end of the day I clean it and weart it out too. About to buy another one before they stop making them for when and if my first fails I have a back up I would pay far more for this watch if I had to. Semperfi!
B00027JYLC|5.0|There used to be a theory in art college that many of the professors blandly bandied about like religious dogma. It was the theory of \\"aesthetics only.\\"  This theory maintained that it did not matter whether a painting was of a landscape, a penis, or non-representational. A work of art could only be judged by aesthetic criteria.<br /><br />The biggest problem with that theory is that it rarely holds true. A good example of this would be in comparing the work of Diego Riveria to the work of his wife, Frida Kahlo. Riveria was clearly a better painter aesthetically. He had a far better sense of composition, and a keener sense of color than Kahlo.  However, Riveria lacked Kahlo's obsessive vision, and it is her vision that remains far more memorably etched in our conscience.<br /><br />Another example which blows the \\"aesthetics only\\" theory out of the water would be in comparing D.W. Griffith to his one-time assistant Tod Browning. There is no doubt that, aesthetically, Griffith was a far more innovative and fluid director.  However, Griffith lacked two important qualities which Browning had in spades; obsessive vision and pronounced human empathy. It is the latter of these two vivid Browning qualities that renders Griffith a grossly inferior artist when compared to the inimitable Tod Browning.<br /><br />Browning was consistently drawn to and connected with the social outcast, while Griffith espoused his racial superiority and reprehensibly tidied that up in his protruding \\"aesthetics\\" chest.  That Griffith was ( and still is) celebrated, smacks of American and Hollywood hypocrisy and superficiality at its most blatant.<br /><br />Of course, this is nothing new, nor is it confined to the film community.  Conductor Rafael Kubelik was mercilessly attacked and driven out of Chicago by Tribune critic Claudia Cassidy because he programmed ethnic and contemporary music.  How is the late Ms. Cassidy remembered?  Chicago named a theater after her.<br /><br />Celebrated New York Times Music critic Olin Downes publicly ridiculed Dimitri Mitropoulos for his not so secret sexual preference. The freak Dimitri left the New York Philharmonic and succumbed to a fatal heart attack shortly after.<br /><br />Browning remains yet another outcast artist, who is critically compared in unfavorable standing next to the likes of Griffith and fellow \\"horror\\" director James Whale. Yet, Tod Browning defines the word auteur far more than these, or any director of his time, and he has had a far more impactful influence on the generation of auteur directors who followed him (including David Lynch, David Cronenberg, John Waters, Alejandro Jodorowksy, and Tim Burton [well, early Tim Burton]).<br /><br />After the 1931 box office success of Browning's Dracula and Whale's Frankenstein, MGM second in command Irving Thalberg approached Browning and asked him to come up with something to outdo both of those films. Browning responded with his manifesto, Freaks.<br /><br />From the beginning of Freaks` genesis, there were problems aplenty. Thalberg's fascistic boss, Louis B. Mayer, was vehemently opposed to it even at the conceptual stage, and his objections only intensified.  During filming, many on the MGM lot found the sight of the freaks so disturbing that they sought to have the production stopped.  Fortunately, Thalberg came to Browning's aid and saved filming from being sabotaged on numerous occasions.<br /><br />Then there is Thalberg himself, who remains one of Hollywood's most interesting paradoxes.  Unlike Mayer, Thalberg loved movies and knowing his bad heart would doom him to an early grave, he worked diligently on projects he believed in, securing his legacy, albeit anonymously since he always refused screen credit.  The Marx Brothers were a pet project. The brothers really did create as much surreal havoc off-screen as they did on and many at MGM wanted them gone, but Thalberg took them under his wing amd lavished their productions with so much professionalism, craftsmanship and care that the Marx Brothers films following Thalberg's death are substantially weaker.<br /><br />As much as Thalberg loved movies, he loved them for their entertainment value alone and he had no understanding of film as art. It was Thalberg, with Mayer, who butchered Stroheim's Greed.  When Browning finished Freaks, Thalberg, who had previously defended Browning, did not hesitate to cut nearly a half hour of footage from the film (and, as was the norm at that time, burned the excised footage).<br /><br />It was not even box office whiplash, since the film opened to huge crowds in San Diego, but rather it was critical and audience reactions that prompted Thalberg to hand Browning over to the wolves .  While Thalberg did give Browning the green light to proceed with the inferior Mark of the Vampire (1935) three years later, Freaks, in effect, ended Browning's career. He would only be given two more films, one of which, The Devil Doll (1936) he did not even receive screen credit for. Browning's career came to a whimpering close in 1939.  He died an obscure, alcoholic recluse in 1962.<br /><br />Browning, the perennial outsider, could have cared less. He had run away from an affluent home at the age of 16 to join a carnival side show and the dancer he had fallen in love with.  He began acting in his thirties, assisted Griffith, began making his own films and had been moving towards Freaks for years, stamping almost everything he touched with his own unique personality.  Many of his films are lost, or exist only in truncated condition and very few of those have ever been released in any format whatsoever for the video market.<br /><br />The Unholy Three (1925),The Blackbird (1926),The Road to Mandalay (1926) the unjustly neglected, compelling The Show (1927)--with its own parade of freak characters, and soon to be labeled freak star, John Gilbert--the masterful The Unknown(1927,the lost London after Midnight (1927), West of Zanzibar (1928)and Where East is East (1929) are all unmistakably the hand of Browning.  Not coincidentally, all languish in obscurity.  Browning himself continues to be dismissed by less insightful critics, who evaluate the man and his work by contemporary entertainment standards or even accuse the great empathetic artist of exploitation. Browning's standing still remains low. Neither he, nor any of his films have received a single honor by a major film recognition/preservation institution.<br /><br />Despite Freaks strong American box office opening, it was soon yanked (after two weeks) and banned pretty much worldwide for the next fifty years. Freaks was much written about throughout the 1960s and 1970s. With the advent of the video market in the 1980s, the time was ripe for rediscovery.<br /><br />Does Freaks live up to its reputation? That depends solely on perspective. That it is a masterful vision and labor of love from the most authentically unusual artist to emerge from the Hollywood system is of little doubt. If one approaches Freaks expecting it to be in line with the \\"classic horror\\" mold films of the 1930's, however,then one is apt to be disappointed. Despite the misguided marketing strategies of the studio, or Blockbuster styled category labeling, Freaks is not a \\"horror\\" film in the normal understanding of the word. Aptly, it is a horrifying film in the abnormal sense, for it is the horrifying, normal people who intend to murder for money.  Freaks is an unsettling vision and that is the only description one can give to it, genres be damned.<br /><br />That Browning used actual carnival freaks, as opposed to \\"real\\" actors, certainly killed what little chance the film had for box office potential. Myrna Loy and Jena Harlow were among the actresses MGM attempted to obtain for the lead. Not surprisingly, neither of these tinsel town types would touch it.<br /><br />The most unsettling thing about Freaks is in its unflinching turning of the table. For Browning it is the beautiful ones who are the freaks and the freaks who are the beautiful ones. That the freaks are not professional actors is blatantly obvious from the outset, yet they ring far more authentic than the professionals in the film and, indeed many Hollywood actors of the period. The glamorous acting of countless actors in the thirties rings far more false, and is far less memorable. Of course, little has changed.  The pinheads exude a unique substance and spiritual ethos that one could never gleam from Hollywood's fashion plate, which has consistently confused fashion with style.<br /><br />As in Browning's Dracula, it is clear that the director's interest lies in developing the perennial outsider.  The \\"normal\\" characters in Freaks seem under-developed, which may have been Browning's choice, or character development may have been lost in Thalberg's merciless excising of nearly a half hour of footage.  The tacked on happy ending has been debated since its release. It does not work and comes off as a diluted afterthought.<br /><br />Olga Baclanova plays Cleopatra, the beautiful trapeze artist who dwarf Hans, played by Henry Earles, falls in love with.  We know her fate from the outset, which mutes the potential for much needed suspense. Cleopatra is merely using Hans for his wealth while she carries on a not so secretive affair with Henry Victor's Hercules.  Frieda, Hans' pre-Cleopatra fianc&eacute;e, is played by Harry's sister, Daisy Earles, and she sees through the scheming of Cleopatra and Hercules.<br /><br />This is a very slow moving build up. Ironically, Browning, having been accused of exploiting the freaks by critics who simply don't have the guts to readily admit that they just don't want to see them, only shows the freaks in their natural, behind the scene, daily environment.  Browning never resorts to showing the freaks on stage or in performance. Instead, he shows these physical mishaps in reality checks, doing everyday things we would do, such as smoking a cigarette.<br /><br />Foolishly, Hans does not listen to Frieda's warnings and marries Cleopatra.  The wedding banquet scene is still among the most discussed moments of Freaks.  The freaks chant \\"Gooble, gobble. We accept her, we accept her. One of us.\\"  They lift their bowl of wine in acceptance of Cleopatra as a fellow freak and Cleopatra does a freak out. She douses them with the wine, calls them filthy freaks and, with Hercules, mocks her new husband.<br /><br />Cleopatra is slowly poisoning Hans.  Hans and his community know it, and plan retaliation. The sequence is beautifully filmed by Browning.  The culprits are exposed in the back of a wagon, deep in the night, during a thunderstorm. Browning's critics have accused him of demonizing the freaks here. Quite the contrary, Browning empowers his misfits and, in communal effort, they exact a terrifying revenge on an abusive, hostile and normal society who forever has branded them as freaks.<br /><br />Theologian Hans Kung rightly has said that visionary John XXIII will never be canonized by the institution.  Visionaries never are canonized by institutions or institutional types. Kung adds that this matters little since those who appreciate and understand vision have already canonized him.<br /><br />The same could be said for Tod Browning. It matters little if the Academy Awards,the American Film Institute or by-the-numbers critics pay him due or not. The visionaries canonized him a long time ago.<br /><br />* MY REVIEW WAS ORIGINALLY PUBLISHED AT 366 WEIRD MOVIESn obscurity.

Quite the contrary, Browning empowers his misfits and, in communal effort, they exact a terrifying revenge on an abusive, hostile and normal society who forever has branded them as freaks.    Theologian Hans Kung rightly has said that visionary John XXIII will never be canonized by the institution.  Visionaries never are canonized by institutions or institutional types. Kung adds that this matters little since those who appreciate and understand vision have already canonized him.    The same could be said for Tod Browning. It matters little if the Academy Awards,the American Film Institute or by-the-numbers critics pay him due or not. The visionaries canonized him a long time ago.    * MY REVIEW WAS ORIGINALLY PUBLISHED AT 366 WEIRD MOVIES

6305131090|5.0|This is Ken Russell`s most personal film and he admirably does Gustav Mahler proud by refusing to treat the composer with phony reverence. Mahler is no plaster saint here. Instead, he is a neurotic, obsessive Jewish composer, a hen-pecked husband and an artist whose drive stems from the flesh.<br /><br />Unknown to him at the time, actor Robert Powell's role as the composer was his audition to play one Jesus of Nazareth for Franco Zeffirelli three years later. Powell's Mahler is not the Mahler of a Mahler cult. Mahler's writing is clearly an immense struggle, as is his relationship with his wife, family, colleagues and admirers.<br /><br />Russell pays Mahler homage in not succumbing to the type of pedestrian biopic cultists tend to favor. That type of bio treatment can be seen in Richard Attenborough's Chaplin (1992), the kind of well-intentioned but hopelessly unimaginative film one expects from a \\"fan.\\" Julie Taymor`s Across the Universe (2007) takes the opposite approach in her stubborn insistence that the Beatles are not sacred and, thus, aptly produced a film as experimental as were the Beatles themselves (she did Stravinsky and Shakespeare the same honors with Oedipus Rex in 1993 and Titus in 1999).<br /><br />Ever the renegade spirit, Russell, like Taymor, digs into his highly personal interpretation of the artist's core. Mahler  (1974) opens to the first movement of the existential Third Symphony (conducted by Bernard Haitink) juxtaposed against the composer's hut on a lake bursting into Promethean flames. Mahler's mummified wife, Alma (the resplendent Georgina Hale) emerges from a cocoon on the beach and crawls on jagged rocks, struggling to free herself of her bindings. Atop a rock is a bust of her husband, which she embraces and kisses. This dream imagery is explained by a terminally ill Mahler to Alma, who is not amused and misinterprets the dream as symbolic of a marital power struggle. Mahler himself fatalistically interprets the dream as one signifying her birth, made possible by his inevitable, impending death. The entire film takes place on Mahler's final train ride and is interwoven with dreams and flashbacks, piling one existential layer upon another.<br /><br />Mahler is returning home to Vienna after a disastrous season in at the Metropolitan Opera in New York. Mahler was ousted for his unorthodox ways by a Big Apple accustomed to the literalism of a conductor like Toscanini. Mahler, however,is not about to publicly go into the reasons for his return home, especially with a meddlesome reporter who takes the composer's answers strictly at face value. \\"Why is everyone so literal these days?\\" Mahler retorts, dismissing the hack interviewer.<br /><br />Instead of focusing on documentary points, Russell probes the visions and a past idiosyncratically filtered through Mahlerian hues which are, in turn, filtered through Russell's equally eccentric interpretations.<br /><br />Mahler espoused big ideas and when asked his religion, he answers defiantly, \\"Composer.\\" Indeed, Russell (himself a convert) probes Mahler's sell-out conversion to Catholicism; clearly, this was strictly a career move on the composer's part in a blatantly anti-Semitic society. Russell does not shy away from criticism in this sequence (filmed with silent film aesthetics). The cross of Christ and the star of David are placed with the Nazi swastika in an enshrined cave. Mahler bows before money, and Cosima Wagner (Antonia Ellis dressed as an S & M Nazi she-devil) who rewards his rejection of Judaism with a roasted (non-kosher) pig, which Mahler bites into with wild abandon. Predictably, Mahler proves to be as agitated a Christian as he was the agitated Jew.<br /><br />No suffragist, Mahler has been as demanding on his wife as he is on orchestra, insisting that she forgo her own aspirations as a composer and slave in silent servitude to his art, himself, and their children (in that order). This is a hard thing for Alma to forgive; but she also feels her husband's composition of \\"Kindertotenlieder\\" (Songs on the Death of Children) is a case of unforgivably tempting fate that leads to the death of their beloved daughter. Alma is consistently tormented by the image of herself as pedestrian shadow of the genius Gustav. She is left at the bottom of the stairwell as fans adore her returning husband, emphasized by a funeral march movement straight out of Poe. Alma rewards Gustav for all this with an impassioned affair (one of many) and it is a feverishly ill, insecure, humiliated and desperate Mahler here who is trying to win back his wife. Powell and Hale are superb in their roles. Hale is delightfully fickle, icy, frustrated, wayward, and conveys every fiber of a woman loved by the artisans. Powell looks the very image of terminal sickness, especially in a symbolic vignette with the reaper facing him in the form of a female African passenger (in voodoo dress) who likens his music to a dance with death. In one sequence Mahler is depicted as a (Stan Laurel-like) clown, and Russell spares no one in the funeral nightmare, fittingly choreographed to what many consider Mahler's most surreal work: the Seventh Symphony.<br /><br />Russell's film mirrors much in the Seventh. It is a five movement work which begins with an allegro that is part kitsch Viennese waltz, part grotesque military march, energetic and, finally, bittersweet. This opening is followed by the first night music: a child-like walk through the night, replete with cowbells, a giddy dance, and ending with silence. The third movement is the phantasmagoric scherzo; essentially, another night movement that is, by turns, amusing and frightening. A second, amorous night movement follows the scherzo. The Rondo finale is a psychedelic pageant which many critics feel dissipates into complete banality and can be a fitful assertion of life or a dance-til-your-death frenzy.<br /><br />Naturally, Russell utilizes the scherzo for Mahler's overheated funeral, brought on by the composer's heart attack, but the elemental structure of the entire Seventh could be seen as kind of blue print for Russell's film. Alma mockingly spreads her legs before her dead husband's coffin and follows that with a nude, coarse grinding strip with Teutonic beefcakes. Her beau, Max (Richard Morant), represents all of her lovers, and he is decked from head to toe as a stormtrooper. Gustav has been buried alive, but this is of no concern to Alma who is lusted after and sensuously pawed over only now, after she has emerged from her husband's domineering shadow. Mahler is cremated in an oven, but his eyes remain untouched to witness her having the time of her life after his demise, which climaxes with Alma having sex with a gramophone. High art, low camp, sex and death. How better to serve up Gustav Mahler? Mahler's epic works can be tantalizing, self-absorbed, seemingly disparate mixes of banality and nobility, the profound and the asinine, the intimate and the boisterous, sincere seeking drenched with equally sincere cynicism, and, finally, insatiable curiosity permeated with a whiff of pathos, or, often, deadly bathos.<br /><br />Composer Arnold Schoenberg hailed the Seventh as the death of romanticism, but he was only half correct. Mahler was still the romantic, and Russell is equally vivid in that depiction as well. Mahler truly loves his wife above all, and he casts a slight smile when he silently looks away from the train (as he often and tellingly does) to observe a couple deep in love at the terminal.<br /><br />Despite our knowledge of Mahler's imminent fate; his tumultuous relationship with his wife and his obsession with her many infidelities; his fear of his own mortality; his hallucinatory, self-indulgent expressions; his pathos-laden memories of the past; his insincere conversion; his child-like questioning of existential themes; and his fevered, zealous drive, it is the composer's buoyant embrace of life that encapsulates Russell's wonderfully symbolic, baroque vision of an undeniably great and influential artist.<br /><br />* my review was originally published at 366 weird moviestire Seventh could be seen as kind of blue print for Russell's film.

B000GPIPSS|5.0|Tod Browning's Dracula is often unfairly compared to Murnau's unauthorized Nosferatu, and it is an unfair comparison because the two are very different films, which merely happen to share the same literary inspiration.  (Neither are mere adaptations.  The only film to fairly compare to Murnau's would be Herzog's remake with Kinski and, indeed, it compares very favorably).  The vampire of Murnau and Schreck is an accursed, repulsive animal, the carrier of a dreaded plague and the beast fights fiercely to sustain it's life, like a rodent in it's death throes.  The Dracula of Browning and Lugosi is an outsider, a mesmerizing and intensely austere intruder, who comes to nourish on the aristocratic London Society, who he, paradoxically, yearns to to join (fittingly, for a genuine outsider, it is to no avail of course; he makes rather pronounced overtures and goes to extraordinary lengths to fulfill his ambition there).<br /><br />Dwight Frye's pre-bitten Renfield is nearly as strange an outcast as he is after his transformation, albeit in a far dracula1different light. Renfield is a bizarre, urban effeminate in an old meat, potatoes and superstition land. The villagers are outcasts too, but among them, Renfield is the doomed jester, misguidedly blinded by his foolhardy feeling of superiority over them and stubbornly oblivious to the peasants' warnings.<br /><br />The introduction to the inhabitants of Castle Dracula is among the most discussed in the annuls of Universal Horror and, to many viewers,it is also most perplexing. This is quintessential Browning. The static silence is punctuated with genuine dread, surreal humor, and the unnerving whimpers of a opossum. Karl Freund's camera pans over a decidedly unreal set. The vampire brides slowly emerge as a bee scampers out of it's little coffin. An opossum seems to be ducking for cover in it's dilapidated coffin and it's cries are the only living sounds we hear as we are introduced to Lugosi's Count staring directly at the camera.<br /><br />Renfield's journey to Castle Dracula perfectly captures the sensory view of a crepuscular world. Indeed, no other Universal horror film would convey it as vividly and attempts to do so in later films proved pale imitations.<br /><br />Renfield's arrival to the castle, and state of confusion, is juxtaposed against the awkward but pertinacious emergence of Dracula. Lugosi's emergence seems to partake of a genuine struggle and this echoes the delivery of his greeting which follows. This emergence sharply contrasts with the startling and confused appearance of armadillos scurrying in the ruins below, which also heightens Renfield's confused state.<br /><br />Critics have unfavorably compared this scene to Melford's much more fluid shot of Villar's Count appearance atop the stairwell in Dracula (The Spanish Version). This can be dismissed as sloppy, revisionist criticism. Browning is a master at those elongated pauses where little seems to be happening. With careful, focused attention, this proves to be deceptive, but admittedly is a struggle for viewers corn fed on television bred aesthetics. Comparing the two is akin to comparing an artist as opposed to a mere craftsman. Melford's scene is surface dramatics and cannot illicit anything remotely comparable to the surreal queasiness Browning evokes here. Additionally, Melford's entrance climaxes with a jerky and unintentionally comic Villar greeting his visitor. With Melford, the effect is ruined, never recovers,and only worsens. With Browning, the unreal dread has just begun.<br /><br />The vampire's lethargic descent, set against the massive sets, resembles the pronounced, surreal fire and ice quality of an El Greco. Dracula's torpid greeting to Renfield is an unnatural extension of his body movements, and is exactly how we might expect such a greeting to be delivered after a hibernating state.<br /><br />The absurd myth that Lugosi learned his lines phonetically probably sprang from his verbal introduction here. We sense, not that Dracula is struggling to speak English, but that he is struggling to speak at all here. Lugosi had been in the states for five years and had been playing the part of Dracula on Broadway for three, so in 1931 his English was already as good as it would ever be. His English in Browning's previous \\"The Thirteenth Chair\\", while still not expert, was actually \\"better\\" than it was in Dracula. Lugosi himself discussed how intensely Browning directed his acting in the film, stating that the direction was very different than the way he had played the part on Broadway. Thus, the abnormal delivery was quite intentional on the director's part and the actor never repeated the stylized performance, even when he played the role again some 17 years later in Abbott and Costello meet Frankenstein.<br /><br />Browning, understandably, was an actor's director.  He had acted himself in some 50 films early in his cinematic career.  While it's true that he never found a real replacement for his beloved Lon Chaney, he did have a rewarding collaborative partnership with both Lugosi and Lionel Barrymore, even if he did not find those as satisfying.  (He reportedly worked well with Lugosi, but only used him once more, in Mark of the Vampire. Browning's relationship with Barrymore, by most accounts, proved to be combative but he did work twice more with Lionel in Mark and The Devil Doll , and, to be fair, the teaming of Chaney and Browning would not be equaled again until Herzog and Kinski).<br /><br />Browning makes much use of body language with Lugosi, Van Sloan and Chandler.  With Lugosi and Van Sloan he focuses intense concentration on the eyes and hands.  When Dracula leers at the seated Renfield, Browning and Freund utilized a pinpoint spotlight in Lugosi's eyes to enhance the hypnotic effect.  It's quite unreal and, just as equally effective, later there will be a symbolic connection to Van Sloan's hyper-pronounced glasses.<br /><br />The emergence of Dracula's three brides, in an attempt to feast on the drugged Renfield, will also have a symbolic connection.  Renfield will soon be transformed, but it will not be by the three women.  Dracula stops them just in time to take over the feasting himself, and one wonders whether Renfield symbolizes the first of Dracula's three replacement brides (Dracula tells Renfield earlier that he is only taking three boxes and one assumes, at first, that his brides will be traveling with him, yet they never re-appear and so this seems to be a set-up for their replacements.  Had Renfield been as fiercely loyal a disciple as he professed he was going to be, he may have been converted to full fledged vampire and joined his master).<br /><br />Renfield paves the way for Dracula's entrance into society, a bit like the Baptist proclaiming that good news is coming.  Like any disciple, Renfield is, by turns, both overly zealous in his proselytizing and frequently faltering in his loyalty and one feels it is the characterization of Renfield that Browning identifies with and enjoys the most.<br /><br />Before merging with London society, Dracula must feed, and it is an innocent and waif-like flower girl that becomes his first victim.  (The girl being of obvious lower class, he does not transform her, but merely kills her.  London's elitist status quo system quickly rubs off on him).  Dracula is both elegant and sinister here.<br /><br />Dracula enters the opera house to strains of Schubert's \\"Unfinished\\" symphony and then, very quickly, the conclusion of Wagner's \\"Die Meistersinger' prelude.  It is the only music in the context of the film.  Browning's extensive use of silence proved to be an artistically sound decision.  That point was especially made when Universal tacked on Philip Glass' execrable score for the film's anniversary release.<br /><br />We are now introduced to Helen Chandler's complex and vastly underrated Mina.  Again, Browning is expert in drawing forth a nuanced and interesting performance from an actor.  The role of Mina is one of the most pointed criticisms in the Browning film, deemed unworthy and pale next to Lupita Tovar's role of Eva in Melford's version.  Indeed, Tovar gives the only decent performance in the Melford film, but compared to Chandler, Tovar is obvious (yes, she's more overtly sexual) and also more amateurish.  Chandler acts with her body, her eyes, and facial gestures.  The way Chandler touches herself, as she frequently does in the film, so delicately brushing her collar bone, as if to cover her vulnerably exposed flesh, conveys a sort of girlish outrage at Lucy's expressed attraction to the dark toned utterances of their foreign visitor.  Chandler's is a beautifully and subtly nuanced performance which improves as her character evolves.  The character of Mina evolves more than any other throughout the film. Mina's bedroom scene with Lucy, further enhances this.  As Mina listens to Lucy's fascination with the Count, she again touches herself, folds her hands, looks intensely at Lucy with a young woman's superficial naïvet&eacute; and genuine concern.  She runs her fingers over the wooden arm of the chair, a state of occupied wandering, as if it is a diversion from the true extent of her friend's dark sexual attraction to Dracula.  \\"Give me someone a little more normal,\\" Chandler says, acutely capturing her character's Victorian stuffiness and adolescence.  Chandler finally relents to Lucy's crush.  She gets up, still half mocking Lucy, covers her exposed flesh again, indicating her virginal state,and beautifully kicks up her knee in departure, like a sixteen year old girl.<br /><br />Chandler's years of acting experience are in full flower here.  She had been very active in theater for well over ten years, had acted with both Barrymores in productions of Shakespeare and Ibsen, had gotten good reviews for the film Outward Bound and was already deep in the throes of the alcoholism that would eventually take her.  She was hardly endowed with the innocence she portrayed in Mina, but undoubtedly tapped into the memory of it (and later, innocence lost) to give Mina resonance.<br /><br />Lucy's death scene is well filmed and shows Browning at the peak of his powers.  A lamp with three female figures rests next to her (the figures echoing Dracula's three vampire brides).  Behind the lamp is an ominous clock.  She drifts to sleep ever so slowly.  Dracula first appears as a silent bat hovering before Lucy's open window, then a moment later he is in human form, a few feet away from her as she sleeps.  He methodically bends his arm, as if he is re-shaping from bat to human before he approaches her, moving as if almost under water.  When he is inches away from her, the scene dissolves into a medical theater of sorts.  Doctors are hovering over Lucy's corpse as students watch from above.  The students seem as lifeless as Lucy and not only do we have the feeling of undead, but a dream-like feeling of something unreal permeates the scene, as if sprouted from Baudelaire's Poe.<br /><br />We are now introduced to Edward Van Sloan's Van Helsing.  From the outset, he is a parallel figure to Dracula and, at times, seems just as sinister.  His hand movements, when he touches Renfield's hand for instance, recall Dracula's distinct hand gestures.  The exaggerated glasses, as stated above, have as much meaning as the pinpoint spotlight in Dracula's hypnotic eyes. Both Dracula and Van Helsing can see well beyond the confines of their surroundings.  They are the only two who actually see, the others are, metaphorically, like lost sheep attempting to see through a glass darkly.<br /><br />Dracula and Van Helsing are metaphorically Christ and Anti-Christ although the distinction between the two is intentionally blurred.  The comparison is apt, as this is the most religious of Universal's horror films.<br /><br />The much maligned second half of the film shifts perspective, but still does not resemble a real world at all and casts an aquatic spell over the receptive viewer.<br /><br />Another very well filmed scene is the vignette of Renfield in his cell as his master silently pays call outside.  The scene cross cuts between the tense, nerve-frayed, overtly emotional, pleading Renfield and the ice cold vampire; fire and ice again.  Renfield bows his head, devastated, in a half prayer for the intended victim, Mina, which goes unanswered.  This flows into Mina sleeping in her bed.  Again Dracula appears as a bat hovering before a window.  Then, Browning's sharp trademark intercut.  Dracula is suddenly in the room.  He is in human form, but his arm is lifted, almost as if he is unfolding.  Lucy's three figure lamp is now mysteriously placed in Mina's room.  There is no explanation for this, save for symbolic foreboding.  Another sharp intercut; a close-up of Lugosi, who looks young and even handsome here.  A long shot of Draculas' full, slowly approaching figure cross cuts with a repeated image of the sleeping Mina, then another sharp intercut to an intense close-up of Lugosi, whose face is now twisted into a hideous expression.<br /><br />The following night reveals a Mina recounting her bad dream to fiancee Harker.  Van Helsing overhears this, approaches her, puts on his glasses to examine her, lifts the scarf from her neck, to which she responds with an almost sensual gasp.  This is Mina on the verge of transforming into a more ethereal and more interesting character who understandably begins to find her fiancee increasingly dull.  Mina's facial expressions range from introverted guilt, shame, half-masked pride, and finally, a thinly masked yearning for Dracula after he makes his appearance to the group.  Van Helsing interrupts the foreplay between Mina and Dracula, and Mina reverts back, albeit briefly, to a more fragile, wounded state.  But Mina's is a wildly mercurial state and again she shifts, this time chastising the doctor after advises that she go to her room.<br /><br />Dracula feigns concern over Mina's bad dreams, while Mina twirls her fingers through her scarf.  She rises her from the couch, kicks up her knee and closes her eyes in a state of ecstasy as Dracula recommends she do as the doctor advises.  This is when the Puritan Van Helsing makes his discovery of Dracula in the mirror.  The reactions to the smashing of the mirror are priceless.  Herbert Bunston's expression of uncomfortable awkwardness during Dracula's explanation plays well with Manners' display of disgust and Van Sloan's gleeful pride.<br /><br />Another highly effective bit of acting is in the scene in which Renfield describes his master, parting a red mist.  This is Dwight Frye's best scene in the film and he plays it with all the sincerity of an obsessed apostle.  Renfield's narration dracula2here resembles an epitaph for a biblical saint and his miracles.<br /><br />The showdown between Van Helsing and Dracula, both believing themselves to be the protagonist, is made the more surreal by Dracula's hissed departure, fleeing the cross, yet unaccompanied by any dramatic music attempting to tell us this is a dramatic scene.<br /><br />The rest of the film pretty much belongs to Chandler and one of the most unsettling images in that last quarter is the close-up of Chandler, almost fully vampiric, as she leans into Harker.  Her wonderfully expressive eyes now express only deadness, a bit like a doll's eyes.<br /><br />Dracula descending down the stairs of Carfax Abbey to kill Renfield takes us back to Dracula descending down the stairs to greet Renfield near the film's opening, and there remains but one act of penance to pay, this being from the film's blasphemer, Count Dracula.  When Van Helsing stakes him off screen, Chandler's body twists, thrusting in agonized reaction, her firsts clench and her breasts heave as she loses her master and, we empathize because we will see nothing of the like again.  Comparatively, recent pickings from the crop, such as  \\"Twilight\\" are typical shallow fare.

B003XWEQ1G|5.0|Movie - 4.5    I admit I don't know much about the general mythos of Robin Hood itself other than the \\"steal from the rich and give to the poor\\" ideal and various names of the characters. My experience with the franchise is limited to 1973's animated Disney film and 1991's Prince of Thieves, of which I'd say it's been at least 15+ years since viewing either. I do, however, know of Ridley Scott and his penchant for being a very detail-oriented director, especially in period pieces. And with that said, my expectations for this re-visioning of Robin Hood lore were set somewhere between \\"really high\\" for the production side of things and \\"to be surprised\\" for the story (going in as a blank slate). Thankfully, I wasn't let down on either end. Robin Hood (2010) is the origins story of Robin Longstride, an archer who served under King Richard during the Crusades that, under some dire circumstances, came to inherit the identity of Sir Robert Loxley. Upon returning to England, he would assume the life of Sir Loxley in Nottingham and make some discoveries about his true past that would eventually turn him into the outlaw of legend, Robin of the Hood. There are sub-plots and conspiracies abound throughout such as the genesis of Prince John's tyranny, the betrayal of Godfrey, and the invasion of the French, which, for all intents and purposes, never manage to bore. But what I love about the film, in addition to its storytelling, is its balance of thematic elements and truly exuberant production design. We get to see the foundation for Robin's beliefs established, a little bit of (unexpected) whimsical comedy between his comrades and initial relationship with Lady Marion, some inspiring drama about the freedoms of choice and its rise against the rule of oppression, and, of course, a bevy of stunningly photographed action sequences. As a result, I have to say I thoroughly enjoyed this film and really hope they make a sequel, given how much they've built things up and  establisheda grittier kind of portrayal for this new Robin universe. I've read many a negative review saying the story isn't representative enough of the Robin Hood they \\"know,\\" but considering the nature of legends and folklore in the first place (and the fact that this is a movie), who's to say a little re-interpretation isn't allowed every now and then? Casino Royale and Batman Begins rebooted their respective franchises and seem to have garnered a good amount of critical reception. Not to mention, the original screenplay for Robin turned out to be something like 7 hours long (all the more reason for a sequel or two). But regardless of the truncation for what could be a massive epic, I, for one, am very happy with what Sir Ridley has managed to create here by way of a great crew and cast of actors. If you haven't seen this yet, I highly recommend the Director's Cut, and that version only. It's only 16 minutes longer, but much like Kingdom of Heaven, those minutes really make the difference.    Video - 5.0    Photographed by John Mathieson, his second Ridley Scott medieval-project after Kingdom of Heaven, Robin Hood looks spectacular. Overall saturation and filtering are a smidgen on the dark side, and colors are a little subdued and less vibrant than could be, but I absolutely love the filmic texture and theatrical feeling it brings to the picture. Being set 20 years after the events of Kingdom (no direct correlation to the story, but just as an example of aesthetic continuity) and at the end of the Third Crusades, I really like the kind of grimy \\"aftermath\\" effect the photography has in showing the harshness of poverty for all the townsfolk and how it sets a much darker and realistic tone for this new Robin incarnation. Greens, browns, blue, silver, and black tend to be the most noticeable colors within the artistic palette and may not be as awe-striking to others as it is to myself, but I personally find it refreshing to see such elaborate and authentic-looking costumes,props, and sets (without the inferior MPEG-2 encode *cough* Kingdom) in all their glory. Contrast is especially excellent, revealing a lot of the tiny lines in facial features, armor, and various background objects. Black levels are deep and inky as well, providing some great shadow delineation and nighttime shots, of which the latter has very little presence of noise, if any. But my biggest praise goes to the image detail. Despite having a slightly darker look, overall detail always maintains a reference level of sharpness. Everything from beard stubble and hair, down to the notches and kinks in armor and weapons show an immaculate sense of depth. And to top things off, the fine layer of film grain present throughout the movie is never bothered in the least. There are also no signs of artifacting or debris to speak of and what looks to be zero traces of EE, DNR, and banding. This is one of my favorite BD transfers of the current year, and with the beautiful cinematography, should be a visual delight for fans of the film.    Audio - 5.0    Equally as impressive as its video transfer, the audio transfer for Robin is just as immersive. About 5 minutes into the film (the French castle invasion, yet again) the movie just opens up with what seems like an auditory overload of creaking wood, screaming soldiers, clanging metal, burning fires, and flying arrows all about the sound field, followed by a healthy dose of LFEs upon the ignition of some oil bombs stuck to the castle gate. Spatial separation and directionality are key in providing listeners with a sense of ambience. And while the action is dispersed in chunks throughout the film, you'll be sure to hear the transition when it happens. However, what blew me away the most wasn't the fullness of the blockbuster-esque sound effects, but the subtlety of the dynamics and all the little noises. Buzzing bees travel about the front and rear surrounds with amazing clarity, while the jingling and jangling of chainmails give the film a very 12th-century authenticity (as if the visual aspect didn't do it enough already). Dialogue is fairly centered for the most part, but does pan a little from the sides here and there whenever Max von Sydow's character is around. It's not a problem at all (and is actually kind of cool to hear), never resulting in lost lines or awkward mumbling. It's as much of a Ridley Scott Robin Hood movie as you could ask for with a great deal of balance in every audio aspect. Also, I really have to give my praise to Marc Streitenfeld for a wonderfully composed score. In the extras, he said that 12th-century music is something that can't really be pinpointed based on what little knowledge there is about the instrumentation of the period. But with that aside, he still infuses a great Celtic orchestral feel that manages to be as epic and adventurous as the rest of the film. Low ends from the music, horse hooves, and various heavy hits round out this reference track in terms of general LFEs.     Extras - 3.5    The extras are something of a disappointment for me. While Scott's other period masterpieces (Gladiator and Kingdom of Heaven) got hours upon hours of bonus features (Kingdom of Heaven on the 4-disc DVD, anyway), those presented here on Robin Hood feel much more underwhelming. To start, there's the \\"Director's Notebook,\\" a P-i-P commentary that's only available for the Theatrical Cut of the film where Scott and various cast and crew talk about the making of the film. It plays a lot like Warner Brothers' Maximum Movie Mode, though I have to say it's not nearly as immersive. There's a lot of empty space between sequences where nothing happens at all, and when the interviews/commentary do pop up, it's only for a mere matter of 4 to 5-minute chunks, hardly representative of the work I feel they must've put in. Outside of the commentary, the meat of the extras are crammed into a 1-hour behind-the-scenes feature, \\"Rise and Rise Again: The Making of Robin Hood.\\" Here, itcovers pre-production (18 minutes), production (29 minutes), and post-production (15 minutes). Sadly, it's in SD and totals only an hour in length, as opposed to an hour per segment and in HD on a separate BD. While it's a pretty informative look at the workmanship that went into making this film, I really wish these extras were given a more thorough and in-depth presentation. And how about a segment or two on the past interpretations of Robin Hood, or maybe interviews/comments from historians or scholars interested in the myth and what they like about this new Robin in comparison? But alas, it seems someone decided to stymie up on the extras. To end things, there are also deleted scenes with commentary, picture galleries, and a section for all the trailers and TV spots of the film. Hopefully, if there's a sequel it'll get the special features it deserves.    Overall - 4.5    I've recently become a big fan of Sir Ridley Scott these past few years and really appreciate his fine attention to detail in film-making. I also don't know much about the legend of Robin Hood either, but I like the apparently darker tone this new Robin takes. It's not quite as gloomy as Gladiator, nor is it as thematically heavy as Kingdom of Heaven. However, I like how it borrows just enough from both, adapts those elements with this iconic hero, and manages to give the myth a fresh twist. Presented by Universal with reference A/V quality, though a \\"could've been better\\" set of extras, Robin Hood (2010) comes highly recommended.

B001DF68MA|3.0|I bought this WeeRide after reading overwhelmingly positive reviews on Amazon.  I already spent too much money on a Topeak BabySeat that sits in the back while my 9-month old keeps slipping, so I figured another $60 isn't that bad if it works!    The LTD WeeRide arrived quickly in a small package.  All you need is an Allen wrench which is included in the package.  The installation, however, took both me and my husband a good hour.  We have a LL Bean Women's Roundaround Cruiser, the distance between the seat post and the handle bar is quite short, so we had to use the inner hole on the mounting bar.  Also, you really need to know how high you want your bike seat to be before you fix the WeeRide mounting bar because once the bar is on and you want to adjust your bike seat, you will have to adjust the mounting bar again!  The WeeRide saddle is attached to the mounting bar by a knob with a screw. The screw on the knob has to go through the saddle, then screw on the mounting bar.  However, only a small amount of the total length of the screw can be screwed on to the mounting bar with threads.  The majority of the length is in the saddle where there is no thread and just a plastic tunnel.  When my son is on the seat, and he shifts from side to side, the saddle goes with him a little bit.  The seat belt is difficult to adjust, as other reviewers have mentioned.     The biggest problem for us though, was that after I install the mounting bar, I can only install my adapter beam on top of it in order to mount my bike to the trunk of my car.  Between the WeeRide mounting bar and my adapter beam, there is very little room for the trunk rack to go between, making it extremely difficult to mount/take off my bike from the trunk rack.  I would imagine this not to be a problem if you have a men's bike because you would then put the WeeRide mounting bar above the beam.      I also have to turn my legs outward to ride the bike (and I am only 5'3\\"), and it is impossible to stand up when climbing up hills.      I would have given this a 2 star but my 9-month old does enjoy the ride tremendously.  He seems relaxed in the seat and frequently turns around to see things.

B0016OMFO8|5.0|I love this CD!!!!  My favorite is the first Traveling Wilburys Volume 1.    I watch their videos on You Tube and I'm always struck by how much fun they were having while playing together.  Such joy on their faces!    George Harrison was my favorite Beatle, a beautiful soul and spirit.  I grew up listening to Roy Orbison on AM radio and 45's.  I miss them both terribly may they rest in peace.  I can leave these CD's on my player in the car for weeks at a time and listen to them over and over.  I'm glad Dylan and Petty are still rocking!  I'm not as familiar with the rest of the band, incredibly gifted and talented all!!!  I will wear these discs out and buy them again!  However Mark Knopfler is the BEST singer, songwriter and guitar player on Earth.   When I get to heaven I hope they're  playing his music!!  Peace out.  Mary

B003W77SDU|5.0|Barely knowing one word of Spanish myself (ironic since I am part Puerto Rican) the title of this review is translated via a website and comes out roughly to mean The Musical Excellence Of Gloria Estefan for those out there even less knowing of Spanish than I. It's a beautiful langauge,as many in the World are and first and formost I just have to honor Gloria for going back to her cultural roots with this album. After nearly a decade at the point this was made singing in English with The Miami Sound Machine,themselves once an all Spanish singing wedding band from the Miami area Gloria and Emilio Estefan decided that reconnecting with the music that she'd baught via a poppier style to the American mainstream only years earlier was deserved of being presented by her to the public uncut. Part of that meant singing the entire album in Spanish. Now for those people who do know little to none of the langauge that's alright;Gloria baught us into her vision by including English translations to all the lyrics and it's even possible to pick up a little of the Spanish lanuage by singing the songs and matching them to the English lyric translations. And that mild educational aspect is a big aspect of this album because it encompassess the music as well. With many of the lyricspenned by Gloria herself along with the compositions of  Jorge Luis Piloto,Juanita Marquez and the like this album is,by and large a lively and involving set of high energy,sensual and emotionally charged salsa pieces that are wonderfully and beautifully chorded enough to listen to casual and terrific dance music as well. Clear early 90's sound aside this album is musically very traditional Cuban/Latin style big band and small group style music with such powerful songs as the title song (translating to \\"My Homeland\\",\\"Si Senor\\",\\"Volveras\\" and \\"No Hay Mal Que Por Bien No Venga\\". There are also a handful of slower latin ballads such as \\"Con Los Anos Que Me Quedan\\" and \\"Mi Buen Amor\\",showcasing that classic Spanish romanticism. The album ends on a wonderful high octane note with \\"Tradicion\\",a song Gloria and Emilio actually wrote about bringing this style of music to an audience outside the usual foreign music market and that it could be enjoyed and understood on it's own without too much preachiness. It's presented in vibrant Cuban jazz setting with some fiery sax,trumpet and persussion effects courtesy of musicians such as Paquito D'Rivera,Arturo Sandoval and the immortal Tito Puente. This not only began Gloria's rekindled interest in recording music in her native language but also succeeded in it's mission to be this music to a culture that may not speak the language entirely but can find a way to embrace it all the same. And,if those who like me are a bit confused by the language of the lyrics,which by the way Gloria sings in a voice finer and more rangey and fire than even before listening to the band on these cuts is also sure fire proof that it's true about music speaking louder than words and being as close to a universal language as anyone could ask.\\",showcasing that classic Spanish romanticism.

0307454541|2.0|I've been reading the reviews that are more negative-leaning and I must say I am relieved!  I thought I was just missing something that everybody else in the ENTIRE world \\"got\\".  I was looking through books to buy when the saleslady just gushed over this book and said I would love love love it.  'And... there are two more following this one!!! (so excited)...\\".  Okay, so I had already heard about it and was interested.  I also heard it was being made into a movie (really can't imagine that).  I wanted to read it before my opinion of the story was tainted by another dumb movie.  I have read to page 194...over several WEEKS!!  I can't read more than a page without turning the light out and going to bed.  It has saved me a fortune in sleeping pills!  Even now, I am trying to give this a chance.  I agree with other reviewers that the excruciating detail of some of the background stories and conversations tested my patience right from the start.  Normally, if the story was the least bit interesting, I would be halfway through the second installment by now.  I have had this book for weeks and can't seem to get into it.  I wont put it down just yet - although I did find myself looking through old books for something to interesting read tonight (sigh).  I too, hope that there will be some twist or revelation that will spark my interest. (I thought the sending of the framed flower every year was a great hook and I had such high hopes!) I will read my one or two paragraphs tonight and sleep like a baby...sorry Ambien, there's a girl with a dragon tatoo in town.  If I ever get through this quicksand of a story I will update this review.  At the rate I'm going will be sometime mid-2011.  See you then.
B003XWEQ1G|3.0|If you're a huge fan of Errol Flynn's version of \\"Robin Hood\\" you'll be surprised (and perhaps disappointed) by Ridley Scott's (\\"Kingdom of Heaven\\", \\"Gladiator\\", \\"American Gangster\\", \\"Body of Lies\\", \\"Alien\\" and \\"Blade Runner\\" among other films)variation on the legend of Robin Hood. Interestingly, this gritty representation of the Robin Hood legend eschews just about every element in the various Robin Hood movies and TV shows made over the years. Scott went on record as stating the only Robin Hood movie he thought was good was \\"Robin Hood: Men in Tights\\" by Mel Brooks.<br /><br />SPOILERS:<br /><br />Robin (Russell Crowe)serves under King Richard (Danny Huston in an all too brief appearence)as an archer and isn't anything more than an intelligent peasant. Richard and his men continue to plunder other kingdoms on their way back from the Crusades to rebuild the coffers of the king. When Richard is killed in battle, Robin takes the opportunity to return home masquerading as Robert of Loxley a Knight ambushed and killer while trying to return the King's crown to England by Sir Godfrey (Mark Strong)an English knight secretly working for the French. The dying Robert convinces Robin to return his sword to his father (Max Von Sydow)to make amends as the two had a falling out years before. Pretending to be Robert of Loxley has its privledges but also forces Robin and his compatriots to stay in Nottingham with Robin playing the role of Robert husband to Marion (Cate Blanchett)so as to protect the Loxley land from seizure by the Sheriff of Nottingham (an idea proposed by Robert's father). In the process Robin discovers a secret to his past and the fate of his own father.<br /><br />END OF SPOILERS:<br /><br />Taking substanial liberties with the Robin Hood legend, Scott and writer Brian Hedgeland (\\"L.A. Confidential\\")takes a number of creative and unexpected turns in retelling the legend of Robin. Based on ANOTHER screenplay that tackled the same subject giving the Sheriff of Nottingham a more sympathetic role, the film went through rewrites up to and including the actual shooting of the film. Usually this results in a disjointed project (and isn't that unusual for Scott's films but often results in mixed results)but Scott and his cast manager to pull the film together. Reportedly the film had uncredited rewrites by playwright Tom Stoppard as well to give a sense of depth to the characters. Crowe does an interesting variation on his performance from \\"Gladiator\\" here creating a Robin weary of war who just wants to return home.<br /><br />The Blu-ray looks quite nice capturing the earthen tones and gritty look of the film.<br /><br />We get both the theatrical and \\"Director's Cut\\" of the film (the latter runs about 15 minutes longer)as well as deleted scenes, featurettes, etc. that give us some insight into why Scott chose to go in the direction he did with this project. The theatrical vesion can be viewed with the \\"Director's Notebook\\" which has behind-the-scenes footage, drawings by Scott and interviews. Interesting, Scott chose not to do a commentary track for this edition (or Universal is withholding it for a deluxe edition later down the line). We also get a DVD version of the film as well as a digital copy designed to download to portable playing devices.<br /><br />Although \\"Robin Hood\\" lacks the dramatic power and impact of Scott's last two historical epic films (\\"Gladiator\\" and \\"Kingdom of Heaven\\"), he does a nice job of defying expectations based on previous tellings of the same tale. This is a marked improvement over Kevin Reynolds' film (with Kevin Costner) from over a decade ago and Crowe at least makes Robin a believable character within the context of Scott's universe. This is far from Scott's best film but it is entertaining and if it runs a tad long (both versions), the performances will keep you engaged. I liked the film (which means I had to give it four stars--I would have given it three which to me means it's a \\"good\\" but not outstanding film if not for how amazon defines 3 vs. 4 stars).<br /><br />I suspect many of the negative reviews reflect disappointment with the way the story has been told compared to previous incarnations of \\"Robin Hood\\". The \\"Director's Cut\\" IS superior to the theatrical version adding in a couple of scenes and extending others that improve the drama. \\"Robin Hood\\" is more of a period film with action rather than an action film with period touches. The action isn't quite as intense as \\"Gladiator\\" or \\"Kingdom of Heaven\\" but they are also in service to a very different story.<br /><br />I'd recommend \\"Robin Hood\\" reservations--the pacing in the first half ia a bit turgid and it plays more like a prequel to ANOTHER film about \\"Robin Hood\\" but is still enjoyable.vs. 4 stars).

B00003CXAT|4.0|*** This review may contain spoilers ***<br /><br />You don't need me to tell you that \\"Jurassic Park\\" (hereafter JP) has indelibly embedded itself into humanity's collective consciousness. You don't have to be a paleontology or prehistoric animal or dinosaur buff (as I am), or have seen JP in the theater after waiting at 10 p.m. in insanely snaky long lines (as I did) or own the VHS video or Michael Crichton novel that inspired JP (as I do) to appreciate the movie's special status in movie lore as the source of realistically animated extinct beasts. Yep, JP is immortal. But it is not perfect. Why? Well, it's the insidiously asinine and anticlimactic climax!<br /><br /> Our intrepid team has cleverly eluded the velociraptors throughout the extended chase sequence at the island center culminating in the atrium with the Tyrannosaurus skeleton. However, the cunning theropods have surrounded the team. How does the team escape? One more brilliant plan? No! The T-rex which battered and spit out the tour jeeps earlier in the movie materializes behind them out of nowhere to chomp on and spit out the raptors and smash his skeletal relative, and provide the necessary distraction for our crew to flee!!! Our toothy savior! Wow, how does a 3-7 ton salivating monster sneak up behind you unnoticed? How did he get into the atrium anyway? Presumably, he must have broken through a back wall. But why? What is his motivation? Why chase puny humans when he has his pick of fleshy hadrosaurs, ornithomimids, or ceratopsians to hunt? Admittedly, the sequence is exciting, but it really is just a dumb version of the \\"god (dinosaur) in the machine\\".<br /><br />I understand Spielberg was so impressed with the T-Rex that he couldn't resist bringing it back for the JP climax. Shame on him! He should have resisted the urge. Even the center exploding would have been a better climax.<br /><br />Is it too late to make or discover an alternate ending?<br /><br />P.S.:  JP does not have many illogical scenes, but another one recently came to mind.  Of course, everyone remembers the glass of water rippling from the T-Rex's vibrating footsteps.  God knows I love monsters that can make the ground vibrate with their footsteps.  However, the T-Rex stomping around like Godzilla really does not make much sense.  Everyone knows that if a predator wishes to capture prey, it does not announce its presence until the very last second, when the prey has no chance of escape.  Any unusual noise, like STOMPING, would scare the prey away.course, everyone remembers the glass of water rippling from the T-Rex's vibrating footsteps.

0345349571|3.0|Barbara Tuchman is an extremely detailed and descriptive historian, having published numerous, well received books on a wide variety of subjects.  In this tome, she examines \\"The Calamitous 14th Century\\", through the eyes of a French nobleman of the era, Enguerrand de Coucy.<br /><br />In selecting Enguerrand, Tuchman has identified a well documented, strategically placed, typical upper class French noble man who as fate would have it, was directly involved in many of the seminal events of the era.  While in some cases we have documentary evidence of this, due to the scanty published record for the era, Tuchman is forced to concede that in others, it was possible that he, or others very much like him took a part.  Thus we have the Forrest Gump of the 14th century.<br /><br />While much of the history from the era is fascinating (in a train wreck, grisly kind of way), the detail involved turns at times sleep inducing.  Where many references are treated in other accounts to a paragraph, the same events consume pages and chapters in Tuchman's history.  This is not an indictment on Tuchman, however it turns parts of the book into a work resembling a text book as opposed to strictly pleasure reading.  As I do most of my reading at night, I can gauge my interest by whether or not I read late into the night.  In this case, many times I found myself nodding off after 20-30 minutes; not an endorsement.<br /><br />Having read a number of accounts and histories from the era, I had a relatively sound background and familiarity with many of the actors and regions covered by this book.  Those encountering both for the first time, however, will likely find themselves dazzled by the names, titles, shifting alliances and impenetrable family trees of those involved.  This is not an indictment on the author as much as a hazard for anyone seeking to bring some sense to the subject.  It is hideously complicated at times.<br /><br />In a nutshell, if you are a serious student of history, particularly the era surrounding the Hundred Years War, this is the book for you.  If you're looking solely for entertainment, read Pillars of the Earth.particularly the era surrounding the Hundred Years War, this is the book for you.

B002U5HKZ6|5.0|I read this book the first time when I was in Mumbai India and I was staying at the Taj hotel mentioned many times in the book. Much of the story takes place in that general vicinity so I was able to visit the bar that features heavily in the book and other places. I was in India on one of my many business trips there and I had a driver that I had take me around to all of the different places mentioned in the book. It was almost magical.     I loved this book. As someone said in an earlier review it is one of those books that you read and it makes you hunger and crave another book just like it. The book  that has that much impact.     I went through the slums also featured heavily in the book and got great pictures of things he describes as being there. I visited the area where the lepers hang out and talked to them for awhile. I first read this book in 2004 or 2005ish and I absolutely feel in love with the book. It is always the first book I recommend to people who like the same kinds of books I like.     If you like James Michener, some of Leon Uris' books or Lawrence Sanders this book will have a certain type of feel that you will recognize especially Michener. But it also has a type of rawness that only a man who has truly lived this kind of life can get across.  I loved the book and if you read the teasers for the book and it seems interesting I almost can guarantee that this book will not only be a good read but it will have an impact on you.     This book made India a magical place for me and while I admit that I don't always look forward to the 25+ hour travel time to get there I always look forward to discovering more of the kind of India that this book discusses. Enjoy it.

The book comes in at about 110 pages because Strunk and White use words with the efficiency of a sniper locked on his or her target. Words are used simply, precisely, and none are ever wasted. You will see how elegant and artful writing can be after reading this book, so much so that you will revisit it often.<br /><br />Most professions, the law included, use jargon often inaccessible to the public.  The professionals often argue that jargon help to express complex ideas. Strunk and White will have none of it. For them, there is no idea so complex that it cannot be put into simple, every day words.  The Elements of Style shows how beautiful simple writing can be. I regret not discovering it before attending law school. Your writing will be the better from your engagement with it.
B000EJ9MTW|2.0|I don't know who this album is aimed at, I can't imagine people from the 70's actually getting anything out of this, especially if they are well acquainted with what is now considered classic rock.  On the flip side I don't see kids reaching for this before Buckcherry or whatever the stupid current rock band is now.  You put this album into the cd player and you are greeted with a horrid, and ultimately wimpy castrated scream that should have been cut from the final mix before the best song \\"Dimension\\" comes through.  I really like \\"Dimension\\" but find myself unable to enjoy anything after it for a couple reasons.  First, I just find that I don't really care for their sound all that much, but second and more importantly, this is the kind of band that the more you hear of them they can't help but play themselves into a state of mediocrity.  Their inability to captivate cements itself after you have heard more then one song.  This is their fault for me, but there may be some that enjoy a modern band that pillages from a sound that has been long dead.
0756655307|2.0|This is certainly NOT a complete encyclopedia of characters by ANY means !! Your \\"O\\" section of characters goes from \\"Occulus to Overmind\\"....You completely left out a profile for the classic Daredevil villain \\"The Owl\\" who has been excluded in both this Marvel Encyclopedia Edition and the previous edition ! It's inexcusable to leave out such a classic Marvel villain TWICE now from this and the previous edition, while featuring some waaaaaay more obscure villains. Also NO profiles for other popular Marvel villains such as : Bulldozer, Piledriver, Thunderball, Scarecrow, Diamondhead, ManBull, and the supervillain group The Wrecking Crew nas no profile either ! Shame on you Marvel, DK, the writers, and everybody involved, for these terrible mistakes !

0307454541|2.0|[[ASIN:B0015DROBO The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo]]Girl with the dragon tattoo is an OK book, nothing great about it. Reads like any normal pulp fiction thriller, and the characters are mostly 2 dimensional. A stereotyped hacker, an uninteresting journalist, a quirky billionaire. And you kind of guess the villain half way through, though you don't really get the motive. And the worst part is that the villain is given no chance to fully explain his state of mind, or time for us to analyze what his motivations are. Retribution is quick, and I felt that justice was not served due to this.<br />A good read, nothing mind-blowing, though.
B000R4SMCW|4.0|Anthony Hopkins' character of Ted Crawford in this film is reminiscent of his Hannibal Lecter character in previous films where he plays a devious individual who believes that he can get away with the murder of his unfaithful wife. Ryan Gosling does a good job portraying his opposite in this film, state attorney Willy Beachum who accepts the assignment believing that it is a slam dunk with a confession that later gets thrown out in court. Crawford could have accepted his good fortune and departed, but he continues to taunt Beachum and this leads to the ending of the film, which I will not reveal here. The movie moves along well and was entertaining.
0345505387|1.0|As a devoted fan of the Outlander series, I was deeply disappointed in The Exile. Nothing and no one looked remotely like I envisioned--Scottish mountains do not resemble the Himalayas. The color palette was drab at best. Claire's eyes were brown, not whiskey-colored. Jamie's eyes were brown, except on rare occasions when the artist remembered they should be blue. All the males were about the same height, stature and looks. Most of the time the only way I could tell them apart was Colum's short legs and a bit of red to Jamie's hair. Unfortunately, Colum is not around much. Gone were Claire's tangle of curls, Jamie's height, thick eyebrows, wide mouth and even his build. Everyone had the same eyebrows--men and women--and I got lost in the sea of \\"visitors from another planet.\\" The addition of another time traveler, Kenneth, was weird, not necessary and totally confusing. The idea of a graphic novel is daring as everyone has her own idea of how it should look but this one didn't seem like the artist even read Diana's descriptions. I know she approved the characterizations and art but I guess she has created characters that her readers envision much differently than does she.
B0036EH3WU|5.0|Bought this as a gift for my daughter. She was absolutely thrilled when she got it. She is excited about watching the entire series over again and all the other extras. However, she tells me the game did not have any instructions with it. Says she will just throw the rocks around for fun. Now she will have to search the Internet for the instructions. How dumb it that?

B003RHCS2Q|4.0|Although the series isn't perfect, this incarnation of Stargate successfully melds the mythology of Stargate with the human interaction and survival that is the core of science fiction writing.  Season 2 promises to be even better.  Now if we could just get that SGA movie.
0517548232|5.0|I read this book expecting to be bored.  The author surprised me by putting everything in easy to understand language and common sense examples.  Considering this book was written in 1946 and updated the last time in 1976 it reads like it was written for today.  I thoroughly enjoyed it and learned a lot.  The Austrian School of economics is the only form of economics that makes sense.  This book will help you make sense of it.
B002BJGYUS|5.0|I had heard from various sources that GILMORE GIRLS was fun, sassy, and quick witted, so I thought, heck, I'll buy it for my teenage daughter. Little did I know that I would get sucked in right along with her. The characters are quirky and downright odd, making it one snappy, fun, sensational show.     Here's a list of my favorite supporting characters. Sookie, the chef whose pastries and palatable perfection literally had my mouth watering, even as she went off on some tangent about Lorelai's whatever. There's the reception desk manager, Michel who is strangely bitter, yet so... not, that I could hardly take my eyes off of him. And that accent, ... oooo, la, la. Of course, the show would not be complete without Emily and Richard Gilmore, Lorelai's parents who are so perfect that they are full of flaws. Then there's Paris, one of my favorite characters of all time. She's a total psycho, but somehow, we all love her for the insanity and root her on as she claws her way to the top of the Harvard food chain. And then, da da da dum, we have Luke, the love object for Lorelai's affection and the father figure in Rory's eye.     Of course, the main characters, Lorelai and Rory, are awesome. I particularly enjoyed watching the interaction between Lorelai and her parents. Rory acts like the padding in this relationship and rather than detract from the characters, this interaction works to propel the writing forward. There are no special effects, no cars exploding, no supernatural phenomenon, unless you count Lorelai's sensational appetite for all things quirky. Instead, there is quality acting, writing, and production, creating one superb show.     That said, I didn't like season seven. I felt that I had invested all this time, effort and emotion into the show only to be let down and left hanging in season seven. There are just too many strange things that happen in season seven. It just about ruined the show for me. But that's another review.
1401216676|5.0|What \\"The Killing Joke\\" does more than anything else is explore the inner workings of the Joker and the complex relationship that exists between Batman and Joker. There is a powerful story here about the line that separates a normal person from insanity, and the things that can make a person cross it. Of course, the Joker also learns a lesson here, or would if he was capable.
B003D83DPA|1.0|I can't believe my eyes. Such an image should not be legal on a blu-ray. I don't think I have any VHS casette that is so bad. This Blu Ray only use is to listen to music with TV/projector turned off. I don't think it has more than 320 initial horizontal lines. What a shame !!!
B00005JMXX|4.0|This movie was told by many friends that this was even better than 2012. I have not viewed this movie yet.Shipping time was very fast.
B000BRBA8S|2.0|I would have to fall into the camp that found this a beautiful film with beautiful women that was very slow and ultimately didn't add up to much.  In the end, I also found the male character such a moral zero and so unappealing, that it was hard to be very interested in him, or to see what attracted all these gorgeous women to him.  He was rather sleazy and also basically a jerk.  Is this allowed because he's a \\"WRITER?\\"  Maybe I also found it impossible to understand why anyone would be so cruel to Ziyi Zhang and not want to spend the night with her! His behavior toward her made his later worshipful sheepish behavior toward Fae Wong both difficult to believe and rather silly.  At that point in the movie I couldn't feel any sympathy for him losing the potential love of his life.     Tobacco manufacturers would love this movie.  Half of it seems to involve pensive beautiful people smoking and staring blankly into space, frequently on the roof of the hotel next to the neon sign with a romantic orchestra going in the background.  That got a little tiresome.     Maybe, too, I was disappointed that this didn't turn into a science fiction movie it hinted at.  I did like the futuristic android sequence with Fae Wong better than anything else in the movie.  I'd be willing to try other movies by this director, but this one was a disappointment.  I did wonder if there was some kind of cultural aspect to this movie that made it difficult for non-Chinese to get.

B0007P0LPC|3.0|Twice I had the great privilege to see Fonteyn & Nureyev in the Royal Ballet production of Swan Lake in the 60's. Both times provided an unforgettable experience.  This production is unfortunately a pale reflection of the magic that was Fonteyn & Nureyev. There are probably many reasons for this. One might be that this company is truly inferior. Another, I feel, is that this pieced together studio presentation prevents the fire and emotion of these two great artists from fully flowering. They were not used to dancing minutes or seconds of the piece at one time. In live performance, they spent an entire evening, in real time, immersed in their characters while making a fairy tale seem uncannily real and highly emotional.  There is also the very real dynamic between an audience and performers that is totally missing here. It is so unfortunate that the technology didn't exist at the time to film/tape a live performance of these two.  For those who never saw them live, let me assure you, they were absolutely phenomenal. What you see here, will give you frustratingly brief glimpses into what made them great, nothing more.
0061673730|1.0|Not sure if this is the worst novel or worst philosophy book I've ever read. And I've read quite a few novels and philosophy books but this book sticks out. It is a travel novel inspired by actual events in the author's life and a philosophical treatise but fails as both. The book is based on a motorcycle trip Pirsig had with his adolescent son. It details the entire trip with the story broken by long intervals of Pirsig's \\"philosophizing,\\" complaining, and trivial observations.     First, why it fails as a philosophical treatise: The author once dropped out as a failed philosophy grad student and I can see why he did so poorly in the subject. The book is very unclear and without well reasoned claims. There are several things that good philosophy consists of: 1. It makes true claims that are not trivially true. 2. It makes these claims in as clear and concise a manner as possible. 3. It uses good reasons and evidence to support these claims.     Pirsig's philosophizing is centered around his notion of \\"quality\\" but he does not succeed in making this notion clear and relevant. Right from the start, there is a problem because Pirsig does not give any clear, coherent definition of what he even means by quality. We are given hints, metaphores, analogies and stories and suggestions on what he means and even a somewhat clumsily worded \\"definition\\" at one point but all these remain vague and unsupported. Of course, Pirsig will say (and does so many times in the book) that no definition can be given because by its very nature quality is ineffable and undefinable. But the problem with that is that he DOES give a definition (like I said, a vague and probably incoherent one but one nevertheless). This seems to be a strategy of dodging crucial substantive points to avoid potentially damning counter arguments and examples. That's what it seemed like to me. We are told that his notion of quality has something to do with the common understanding of that term (such as quality in essay writing or motorcycle maintenance, e.g.). We are also told that quality is neither objective nor subjective but is something that comes prior to that \\"duality.\\" We are told that quality is something that is like the Tao in Taoist philosophy, like appreciation for jazz and being \\"cool\\". We are told that quality is the perception of something before it is conceptualized. But all these are distinct concepts and each needs to be spelled out and tied together because they all seem to be saying something very different. Many of these seem to be wholly different concepts with each other but no tying of them together is made (or seemingly even attempted), just a blind acceptence that they all mean the same thing as this \\"quality\\" of his which we should all then blindly accept as the ultimate truth and meaning of life. It seems that Pirsig has many fuzzy ideas and no clear overall cohesive picture but feels the need to impart all his little brain farts on us while suggesting (but never showing!) the relevance to each other and to life and reality. Many of his musings are replete with equivocation and false dilemma fallacies which he seems completely oblivious to.     As a novel, this book also fails for the following reasons. In my view, a good novel should avoid overt proselytizing of the author's views while at the same time have a moral core deeply embedded in the narrative structure. It should also avoid self promotion and pretentiousness. Granted it takes a skilled writer to show naturally, skillfully, subtly and palpably his or her convictions instead of dictating them on the proverbial pulpit to the readers. Pirsig displays no shame in doing the later. He just goes off on rambles and random b!tching about the cruel injustices he has faced in life such as his petty problems and quibbles with his academic advisors, teachers and fellow grad students while in graduate school. These petty problems and quibbles are made into great struggles of wills and epic battles ofGood (Pirsig) vs Evil (his advisors, fellow students, etc). These characters he is doing battle against are cliche and simplistic caricatures. Pirsig wants readers to see him as a misunderstood genius who must struggle against his own inner demons with madness and his stupid and vulgar teachers and fellow students who just don't seem to understand him. One not only sees why he has failed as a philosophy student but as a person worth helping and knowing. The parts of the book about the trip and motorcycle maintenance are mind-numbingly boring. Pirsig tries hard to make them relate to his idea(s) on quality but his straining to do so shows itself without success.    The book passes itself off as an all encompassing, original, life-changing philosophy and this is how many people who have read it seem to see it. But beneath this self-proclaimed Philosopher King's garb is the bloated excesses of New Age nonsense.
B002N5N4M6|5.0|Why I gave it with 5 stars rate? I don't have to be a writer, but I'm an hearing impairment as geek, skater, and deaf.  I describe myself being how much I really love everything about funny in the TV shows.  Big Bang Theory 3 season is incredulous, brilliant, and funniest.  Every episode in the Big Bang Theory 3rd Season just cracked me at all the time.  Big Bang Theory is currently my first favorite TV show, then How I Meet Your Mother is my second favorite TV show. I have a little jealous about that Leopord is luckiest bastard guy to have a super-hot chick on this planet by next the door.  I can't believe those guys kept talking about a lot of geeky stuff than type of girls.  I also enjoy learning every new word from a part of TV show.  I wish I can marry Kaley Cuoco because she is my first favorite actress right now.  I am quite sure that next sequel of Big Big Theory will win an award TV show someday and this Big Bang Theory sounds pretty fun to me.  I will recommend those people to HAVE this one! Last of all, that's all I have say.  I'll see how happen in the Big Bang Theory 4th Season. =)
0393072231|5.0|A fascinating look at the players who actually made money off of the crash. As always Michael Lewis is compulsively readable.
0060786523|5.0|India in 1951 has a great deal of energy.  There is tension between the political parties, some of whom are stirring up trouble with a deal to give poor sharecroppers more equality with the rich landowners.  There is religious tension, between the Muslims and Hindus who live in tentative peace most of the time.  There is tension between the older generations, who are more traditional, and the younger generations, who want more flexibility in their lives.    Living in upper-middle-class circumstances are several families who are the focus of this novel.  Within these families all of the various tensions are played out and examined on a small scale, as they are simultaneously affecting the country as a whole.    I thought this book was a fascinating view of life in India.  I found it completely immersive and felt as though I had a fairly clear idea of what life was like in India at this time from reading it.  I liked that the author didn't go to special pains to explain things.  When he used an Indian word, he trusted that the meaning would come out in context or the reader would investigate to find out what the word was, rather than interrupting the story with definitions.    The characters were varied enough to give me a good idea of what it would be like to live out several different roles in India, rather than just following around one specific character and getting a more one-sided view.    At the beginning of the story, I liked some of the characters and plotlines more than others, but by the end I was eager to check in with each of the characters and see how his or her life was progressing.  This was a truly excellent novel.
0312600844|3.0|As I review this, it is rated three stars. I am also rating it three stars because I was enthralled with 80% of the book. The beginning was slow for me, but once it got started I really got into this book and prematurely recommended it to many people. I liked the descriptiveness and the nuances of everyday life of a handful of people that I could never be or know. I felt the author did his job in transporting me to a different world. Yet, I expected a bit of closure at the end of the book. Naively I figured such a big brand name like Franzen would deliver, but I've made this mistake with Stephen King, Haruki Murakami and others who are name brands. The ending made me hate this book, not because I didn't 'get it,' but because I just didn't care and really had to force through the last 100 pages. I felt a bit cheated when it ended. But I think it deserves three stars for how intrigued I was while the story was moving for so many hours while I read from the start until the last third of it. It is not a bad book, or a poorly written one by any means; it's just that I was left wondering what the point of the whole thing was at the end. For a book to be great, you have to have understood that part of the journey. It's a master writer's job to deliver that to you. I've never read the Corrections, but am tempted to try it just because his writing is so good.
B003TML0VO|1.0|The notion of a guitar classic album in the era of \\"Guitar Hero\\" and \\"Rock Band\\" is clearly a contrived commerical ploy.  And we'd expect nothing less from the tag team of Carlos Santana and Clive Davis.  That said, the idea still has the potential for some artistic merit.  But a combination of poor song choices, cover band miming and mostly typical Santana guitar flourishes has completely ruined what could have been an interesting AND successful venture.    Some of the song choices have you scratching your head.  Would \\"Photograph\\" really appear on anyone's list of top guitar classics?  Including a Van Halen tune is a no brainer, but is \\"Dance the Night Away\\" really a song that defines Eddie's one-of-a-kind stylings?  At any rate, song selection is really just minor quibling.  Performance could easily change things.  But too many of the songs are bland recreations of the original ground-breaking performances.  Some takes are downright blasphemous.  \\"Riders on the Storm\\", despite Ray Manzarek sitting in, has lost completely all of its stark and spooky imagery and without that, what's left?   \\"Little Wing\\" has been covered so brilliantly by other artists, so why try to compete with that?  Carlos, usually a master of beautiful lyrical lines that could have done this composition justice, just doesn't seem to find the feel you'd expect on perhaps the definitive Jimi Hendrix tune.  There are some departures from the lame and mundane, notably Chris Cornell's robust vocal delivery on \\"Whole Lotta Love\\" (something you won't hear from the song's orignal vocalist these days) and the beautiful and inventive reinterpretation of \\"While My Guitar Gently Weeps\\".  But it's not enough to save this mess.  And really, given the talent involved, is a dramatic disappointment.    Crazy Carlos' career has taken some drastic turns and this is definitely one.  We can only hope he finds his way again...
B00005JO20|2.0|The year was 1933.  A fantastic black-and-white movie called \\"King Kong\\" was released.  It's one of the great movies of all time.<br /><br />The year was 1976.  A fantastic color remake of \\"King Kong\\" was released.  It was a huge box office success with a great score by John Barry.  Don't let anybody tell you it wasn't a successful movie and didn't make any money.  Quite the contrary.  Research the facts.  In my case, I didn't even need to research it because I remember how huge King Kong was in 1976.  I saw it in the theater.  It was a box office smash.<br /><br />The year was 2005.  A remake was done of \\"King Kong\\".  I guess this is a remake of the 1933 movie?  But wait... I guess it was a remake of the 1976 movie as well.  Let me see here.........the 1976 movie just wasn't a success apparently.  Maybe the special effects weren't good enough?  Maybe they weren't good enough to satisfy the CGI and video game-loving young people of today?  Maybe that's it.  Not only that, but the 1933 film must be REALLY inferior in the special effects department, not to mention it's in black and white.  Ouch!  Fewer and fewer people like black and white movies nowadays.  I guess the 1933 and 1976 movies didn't do the job.  So..............<br /><br />We got another remake.  LOADED with CGI effects to please the computer and video game generation.  A CGI King Kong instead of a \\"claymation\\" (to use the term loosely) Kong from 1933 and a guy in an ape suit from 1976.  With the click of a mouse, we get Kong as he SHOULD look, apparently.<br /><br />Now about this movie.....<br /><br />Kong himself doesn't look scary at all.  The scariest Kong was in the 1976 movie, then the 1933 movie, in my opinion.  Then we see a long, drawn out fight between Kong and THREE dinosaurs.  This fight is so ridiculous, it left me with my jaw on the floor, staring at the TV in disbelief.  That's the key word - disbelief.  This fight is not at all believable.  It seems every few seconds there's a close call where Kong rescues and protects Ann in the nick of time.  Not only that, but he's fighting the dinosaurs with Ann in his hand a lot of the time.  Not only that, but the jumping around, the falls the characters take, etc. is so non-realistic.  This whole fight sequence is just plain over the top and not believable at all.<br /><br />What is Ann made of, anyway?  Kong seems to fling her around like she's a rubber band.  A good example is when he flings her onto his right shoulder.  She doesn't get injured at all as a result of this?  This movie comes off as a video game most of the time.<br /><br />When Kong is on top of the Empire State Building, at one point he jumps up to try to grab one of the biplanes.  I can't imagine that anybody or any thing would do that while on top of the tallest building in New York City and not be concerned about possibly losing their footing and falling.  Another thing - after Kong falls from the top of the Empire State Building, Ann is just standing there like it's nothing to have high winds blowing against her.  I don't know about you, but I would think that the average person would be very concerned about the high winds blowing at them thousands of feet above the ground and the person would likely be hanging on to something for dear life.  Anyway...<br /><br />This movie seems to follow the formula of the 1933 movie mostly.  The 1976 movie, on the other hand, doesn't copy the 1933 original totally.  Instead, some changes were made - some big, some small.  The '76 movie had a little campiness to it, but not too bad.<br /><br />This movie is a loooooonnnnng three hours +.  A full hour could have been cut from it.<br /><br />All in all, I like the 1933 and 1976 movies.  This 2005 movie was an unnecessary remake.n in the nick of time.

1440503257|5.0|This book is great!  A lot of the treats are really nice to make around the October, November, December months since that's when a lot of the ceremonies go in the Harry Potter books that include lots of food.  Plus, a lot of the food just has an autumny feel.  I also read someone's previous comment about there not being any Pumpkin Juice or Butterbeer recipe.  This is only half true.  There is a Pumpkin Juice recipe listed on page 40 in the book.  Butterbeer is not included, however I found the recipe for Butterbeer here & it's supposed to taste almost exactly like Universal Orlando's Butterbeer.  Here is the recipe [...] .  I'm actually in the process of making a recipe page for Butterbeer so people can print it out & tape/paste/staple the recipe into the book.

I think the music goes in order as well, like ABC and Rockin Robin from his childhood and the last song is You Rock my World was his last real hit I think.
B003PNHW3W|1.0|The vocals on this album are horrible and uninspired. It is obvious that Trent Reznor is trying to hand his new wife a career she could not obtain on her own. There is a reason that she could not obtain it on her own, she has no talents as a musician or vocalist. Trent maybe able to hand some of his fan base to his own personal Yoko, but not this fan.
1416584072|1.0|I forced myself to read this book as it is going to be discussed at my next book club.  The best word I can use to describe this book is tedious.  The dialogue especially was uninspired.  I really could not care less what happened to any of the characters, and the ending was just as boring as the rest of the book.  I was very disappointed in the entire story.
0596806027|2.0|I must say: I enjoyed going through this book. It is written in an opinionated and slightly irreverent style, so I found it a mildly amusing read.     That being said: why do people buy a book on HTML5? Some would like to have a good in-depth reference on the ins and outs of the new language. Well now - that's not this book. Others might be new to web development and think learning HTML5 would be a good starting point. While they are right that HTML (5 or 4) is the place to start, this book surely isn't.    There's some depth when it comes to background, but much less when it comes to HTML5 itself or how to use it. True, the <canvas> tag and geolocation are covered pretty much in detail, but the author made some hard to defend choices in spending his paper estate.     HTML5 gives us no more than a handful of new tags, still some of those (<mark> and <section>, for example) are simply mentioned once and that's that. No examples, no advise on where to use them, nothing on browser support. Yet the book takes five pages at the start to tell the story of how the img-tag came into being some 15 years ago. Again, mildly amusing, but probably not the reason you are thinking of buying this book.    Another example: there are 10 pages with a primer on audio and video codecs, plus another 19 (!) detailed pages (with lots of screen shots) on how to use a number of specific and probably soon outdated software tools to encode video for the web. All fine for those who are completely new to video encoding and believe a book on HTML5 should be the starting point for that. But when it comes to the actual <video> tag (under the aptly named heading \\"At Last, the Markup\\"), this consists of a meager 3 pages that include a statement like this:    \\"The <video> element has methods like play() and pause()\\".     Huh? \\"Methods like\\"? So which other methods are there? And how and where would I use them? Are these standardized across browsers? Where can I find more about them? Any example, maybe?    If you think these are the kind of questions a book on HTML5 should answer, you are out of luck. The above sentence is all the information on this particular topic you are going to get. Not a word about implementing these methods, or on how to style the browsers' native video controllers that come with HTML5 support. There are a good number of external references for information on things like Unicode, codecs and video containers, and some useful scripts, but not a word on how we can get the information on how to control and style the <video> tag. Maybe the logical conclusion would be: in another book on HTML5, perhaps?
B003YGSLDA|4.0|I hear alot of people on hear saying this was not such a great movie,but I,m looking at this film maybe in a different way,This film was done by the same people that did Superman and it really has that same type of feeling to it.Could the film have had much better special effects,I really dont know as remember this film was filmed years ago,One could say that other films that have become classics could have did certian things different also so I guess we really are never pleased with anything.This movie is a nice film and I originally saw it in the theaters and maybe that was the charm,on the big screen it was magnificant.I would say get this Blu ray edition if you have a flat HD tv and sit back and watch this to bring just a real nice feeling before Christmas gets here..Amazon has this for 14.99 which is really a good price.

B003XKPPOU|5.0|Great movie, a great 3rd part.  My 2 year old loved it and we are just waiting for the blu-Ray to become available.
B003ZVJFFM|5.0|I'm not a fan of holiday films and I only like some of them. When I saw A Christmas Carol last year I thought it was the best holiday film ever (alongside with It's a Wonderful Life). With fantastic scenaries and great motion-capture technology, Robert Zemeckis made a classic Christmas movie. Of course Jim Carrey is great in his triple role as is Gary Oldman, Robin Wright Penn and Colin Firth. The atmosphere is dark and cheerful at the same time and every single scene adds to the picture.<br /><br />A Christmas Carol is a great film with a great story and heart. This combo pack is the best way to see it both in HD and SD and to not pay more for a 3d bluray (which I can't use it, and don't care about it) and a digital copy (waste). Just buy it and you will have a great Christmas this year.
0811870413|5.0|The above author must assume you never make bread.  If you are in anyway experienced making bread this is a phenomenally good book.  If you've never made bread before and don't know what a starter is and don't want to find out then don't buy this book.  But if you are interested in perfecting your bread making or trying very interesting new recipes this book is for you.  It's not hard or difficult and most recipes don't call for things a typical baker doesn't have on hand.
0765326353|5.0|I read a lot. I have dabbled into virtually all of the best in the fantasy genre. After reading so many series and authors, I consider myself a very jaded reader. Its hard to surprise me, I try not to be overly critical. I don't like toxic people that are difficult to please, but I know good work when I see it. I went into reading Way of Kings with Brandon's own words in mind. He told me himself that he was excited for this new series. It was going to be big.     It is. Its epic. And that's a good thing. Without spoiling anything. I can say it is well thought out, well written and it makes me care, which is important. I want to find out what happens to these characters, although I admit it was hard to care about Shallan at first. There is plenty of heroism, it comes close to being over the top, but not quite, leaving me shocked and excited. I even cared about the assassin. This is epic, its a really good story. Its also only the beginning of Brandon's series.      This is not without its flaws, sometimes I felt the characters sounded a little unrealistic and somewhat cliche at times, the story almost predictable, though there were twists that I wasn't expecting. I think Brandon needs to flesh out his characters and story more, but wow its good! If there is nothing else you get from reading this review... This book is good and the ending is well worth it, even if it may be a long series by the time its done. Its probably Brandon's best so far. Its epic.
B003DKJ5ZU|5.0|I think the movie was great as did my 2 and 3 year old daughters, even my 5 year old son enjoyed it...I saw some reviews were a bit critical of the coloring and sound, I found no problems with any of that the setting is not 2010 so having more vibrant colors would have looked out of place. I think sometimes we also tend to forget who it is marketed to (2-10 year olds)
0312944926|4.0|I would give this an excellent 5 star rating but I feel that the book could have been wrapped somewhat better.  The wrapping  was starting to come apart by the time it got to me, causing the book to be a little damaged.
0316067938|5.0|I loved it the first time I read it it took me less than 24 hours. I have read it several times since then and wish there was more. I couldn't get enough.  So far by far my favorite book of all time.
0143034901|5.0|Thanks to a man I've never met lending me a copy of The Shadow of the Wind I found a book and writer I could label compulsively readable. I lost time, avoided responsibilty and pretty much didn't stop until I was done on the last page. Books, movies, and television shows might not fit to every taste but I have to admit Carlos Ruiz Zafon is now a writer I'd recommend to anyone looking to read.<br />Zafon does present an interesting mystery with a child who picks up a book at a place called Cemetery of Forgotten Books where unsold books are left to a chosen few who don't reveal its secret. From this book by a forgotten writer Julian Carax, Daniel Sempre our narrator explores a decades while also becoming involved in his own romance with the sister of friend while being menaced by psychotic police officer.<br />Theres more to the plot involving multiple narrators, a dash of historical context involving the Franco regime and Spanish civil war, but everything is so well constructed from character to plot that it would be a crime to reveal more in a synopsis. I'll just say that from Zafon's writing to Lucia Graves excellent translation this is a beautiful and fun read welll worth your time. Definitely worth your time to read in my opinion
B002ZG974W|2.0|\\"Babies\\"  shows four newborns from different parts of the world -- Ponijao from Namibia, Bayarjargal from Mongolia, Mari from Tokyo, and Hattie from San Francisco.      This is a movie that will either inspire such comments as \\"Awwwwwww\\" or be avoided completely by folks with an aversion to blatant sentimentality.  Everyone loves seeing a cute baby, and the movie works on that basic level, but its purpose doesn't seem to go beyond showing adorable kids.  Though we're seeing children from all over the world, I had the feeling I was watching an extended home movie.      For those who care, a featurette revisits the babies and their parents three years later.
B003R0LBVW|4.0|If the right wing anarchists hate this book, it is good enough for me.....thanks for the reviews!
B003OF3R0S|4.0|It was only a few years ago that this band really caught my ear.  I first got started on Avenged Sevenfold after hearing City of Evil.  I was impressed so I decided to take a listen to the rest of the band's catalog.  Aside from Sounding,  I really like every album this band has put out. Since then I have become a huge fan and had the privilege of seeing the band in there entirety on tour.  With that said, I really am shocked that this band has not received more recognition.  I am constantly seeing this band labeled as emo and non metal.  As a huge fan of bands like Metallica, Megadeth, Guns N Roses, Pantera, Machine Head, Iron Maiden, Death, Motorhead, and many others,  this really boggles my mind.  This claim couldn't be further from the truth.  Now on to the album.      1. Nightmare 4/5- Great start to the album.  Fast paced with a nice breakdown.  Catchy riff and chorus.  One of the best songs on the album.    2. Welcome to the Family 4/5- Cool riff with good guitar work and a cool breakdown chorus.    3. Danger Line 3/5- Not a big fan of this song.  While its not bad and has a decent riff it doesn't seem up to the quality of the rest of the album.    4. Buried Alive 5/5- For me this the pinnacle of the album.  I can't say enough good things about this song.  It starts slow, breaks down, and then ends with a bang.  It has everything for me, a cool intro, a good solo and by far the best vocals on the album.  We also get to here some of the screaming singing mix towards the end that made Waking the Fallen such a good album.    5.  Natural Born Killers 5/5-  This is another song that I really enjoy.  It is very fast paced and has what I think is probably one of the best solos on the album.  Great song.    6. So Far Away 4/5-  This a pretty good song.  It is the first true ballad on the album which sort of has a Seize the Day feel to it.  The only thing that I don't like is the vocals on the end of the chorus.      7. God Hates Us 3/5- This song is a mixed bag for me.  It is a very heavy song with a lot of screaming.  While i don't mind that and loved Waking the Fallen, I don't believe that type of song fits with the rest of the album.  It sounds out of place compared to the rest of the material.     8. Victim 4/5- This is another song that starts slow and then picks up midway through.  It starts as a ballad and midway through picks up with a pretty good riff followed by a good solo.      9. Tonight the World Dies 4/5- Another ballad.  Not much to this song.  I really like the vocals and think they are the best on the album next to Buried Alive.    10. Fiction 2/5-  This is the only song on the album that I really do not like.  I can't say much about it other than it just feels out of place and non Avenged Sevenfold.  I understand the sentimental value this song has, but being that this is an album that really seems to be a return to form for Avenged, it seems like a complete 180. I normally skip over it.    11.  Save Me 5/5- This song is a great way to close a superb album.  I absolutely love the guitar on this song.  It's an 11 minute song with a lot variation.  It has some good vocals with a rather eerie ending.  Excellent way to close things out.    Overall this is a superb album with all the stuff that got me hooked on this talented band.  With all the controversy aside from The Rev's untimely death, this a step back to form after the experimentation that was the self titled album. It may not be the best when it comes to lyrical content, but if you like good vocals and awesome guitar with catchy riffs and chorus, look no further.  Hopefully Avenged Sevenfold is finally awarded the recognition they deserve.
0070511136|5.0|\\"SPIN Selling\\" is a welcome departure from the genre of books on selling. Actually, I found the book valuable as a good source of advice on the subject of \\"Persuasion\\".  Many sales books focus on the same basic tenets in sales, the sales opening, closing, handling objections, or some aspect of them.  Neil Rackham addresses \\"sales\\" where the decision to buy is not made in the presence of the one doing the selling.  Much of the decision-making occurs without the rep present to handle objections in person or to enable him/her to make an effective close. As a consultant, many of my opportunities to \\"sell an idea, concept, or approach\\" occur over time and the ideas gain acceptance often without me present. Selling my ideas and convincing a client that my idea is better than someone else's contradictory idea requires the insights that Neil Rackham presents and he presents them in a light-hearted approach that enables a reader to convince himself that the ideas presented are effective and presents a way for the reader to use the advice in bits and pieces, an approach that was effective for me.  As I used his concepts on a daily basis, and even from the start before I became more adept at using his concepts, I could see dramatic improvement in results, even when I recognized that I wasn't very good and needed more practice.  His ideas may seem radical, but in the appropriate situations they are dynamic!

B003MX5P20|4.0|Enrique Iglesias is a very talented artist who has over the years set a style his own, very distinct from his dad, Julio.  His recent work however, including the latest \\"Euphoria\\" depicts the artist somewhat experimenting again.  As in his other recent works, his voice on this album comes across as electronic for most of the album.  It doesn't take away from the album, but it does take away from the artist as Enrique is a pretty good vocalist.  The beats sway between pop and dance.  The setting for this CD is definitely a dance club with maybe a few tracks for driving around, while others for home to contemplate on that significant other.  The album is pretty good, nothing really stellar, with a great deal of guest artists (Akon, Usher, Wisin y Yandel, and Pitbull among others) littered on almost every other track.  The flow of the album was rhythmic with some tracks more upbeat than others.  The lyrics are not exactly profound, but nonetheless pretty smooth.  \\"Euphoria\\" opens up with the upbeat, \\"I Like It (ft Pitbull)\\", but seems to slow dramatically, while maintaining a finger-snapping, foot tapping tempo.  Other great tracks like \\"Dirty Dancer (ft Usher)\\", \\"No Me Digas Que No (ft W y Yandel)\\" and \\"Everything's Gonna Be Alright\\" are expertly placed, bringing up the overall rhythm of the album in the right places.  I was able to listen to the entire CD and enjoyed it, though I felt some tracks like \\"Coming Home\\" and \\"Heartbreaker\\" could have been on a different album.  The work is definitely above average, though an artist of Enrique's calibre could have done better in creativity (for example a quick verse from Luda or Lil' Wayne in \\"Dirty Dancer\\" could have made the track from great to superb), as well as style (I felt this late in the game, he is still trying to find his niche.)  Nonetheless, I would definitely recommend this album.
B003EY7IUY|3.0|This book is a fun and easy read like all of the books in The Shopaholic Series. While this was not my favorite book in the series (Confessions Of A Shopaholic & Shopaholic Takes Manhattan are the best) you must read this if you have been with Becky the Shopaholic from the beginning. Sophia Kinsella is a great story teller who keeps you turning pages. The ending did leave me wanting more of Becky and her friends/family. Plus these Shopaholic books put me in a good mood and make me feel better about getting a little indulgent at the mall!
B000HEWEJO|5.0|This was given as a gift.  But if you like christmas movies this is a classic.
0743289692|5.0|I first saw Ayaan on the Colbert Report. I thought the book may be interesting so I bought it here. Let me tell you. I cannot put the book down. She brings you through her life, parts made me laugh but mostly want to cry for her. I wanted to jump through the book and help her. I really felt like I was growing up with her through her whole life. I just heard about her new book and I cannot wait to pick it up. I really wish her the best with all of her causes .
0439023491|4.0|I have enjoyed this series as a secondary English teacher.  My disappointment comes that I do not feel the second book in this series is nearly as good as the first.  Thus, the four rating.  I think it could have included more details and actions instead of the gore and playback from the first book.
B003AO1SVS|5.0|I like the Black Keys and I've enjoyed most of their albums but this is by far their best album so far. A little more polished and rock oriented, meaning less raw and blues oriented, than their first albums, which can be a good thing or a bad thing depending on your taste. However, their songwriting is at an absolute peak on this album and more than half the songs are simply brilliant. My best album of 2010 so far and a must have for any fan of music.
0765326353|5.0|Thoroughly enjoyed reading this book; took me 4-5 days to finish it. Hard to put down! Sanderson covered all his bases, giving an epic story that comes full circle yet still leaves you wondering what will happen next. Can't wait for the next book!    It is quite obvious that much love has gone into this novel, from the cover and interior artwork to the plot, characters and the fully-developed setting where the world-defining storms impact everything from the landscape to the flora and fauna and magic system.     This is a novel written for those who truely appreciate the fantasy genre, from novels to MTG and MMORPGs. That being said, it could be enjoyed by anyone - though I wouldn't recommend it for children who are sensitive to descriptions of war violence.    I think college courses on fiction writing should study this book and analyze it. Writers would appreciate a lot of the pieces that went into this story.
B002JVWRAO|5.0|Supernatural simply gets better with each passing season, and season 5 is the best yet. I have to admit I liked the monster of the week formula during the first couple of seasons. In addition, I thought seasons three and four, while entertaining, were getting a bit heavy handed and awfully somber. I missed the humor, and I was getting tired of the angels vs demons serial-style episodes, and felt like it was time for the show to move on, wrap up that story line.     Well, season 5 finds the perfect balance. We are treated to several very entertaining monster of the week episodes, which we hadn't seen in a couple of years - in that sense the show sort of gets back to the basics - but the writers also do a fantastic job of moving the angels vs demons story along in some very entertaining and unexpected directions. The latter finally reaches a fever pitch as related plot and character revelations come fast and furious, and the saga reaches its climax. Season 5 also brings back some long lost characters from earlier seasons, and the acting is the best of any of the 5 seasons. Misha Collins, who has always been excellent as the angel Cas, is absolutely suburb, bringing not only a fresh dramatic dimension to the character, but, combined with good writing, a wonderful new humor as well; there are laugh out loud moments, due in part to the dialogue, but also Collins' delivery. Overall, very entertaining.
B001676320|5.0|First let be just state that I usually do not write product reviews but this blue-ray is a must have. The stellar performance by two of the most legendary bands of all time was unbelievable. Both bands playing together and in separate sets just blow me away. This has to be one of the best live concert movie ever filmed. The blue-ray picture quality was excellent the sound was remarkable and the concert was just like I was there. I mean I had to wind down before I could even get to sleep. Trust me you will not be sorry for adding this blue-ray movie to your collection. DEFINITELY A MUST HAVE FOR FANS OF BOTH THESE BANDS!
B000KC86F4|4.0|At first I didn't like the fact that Bryan Singer wasn't at the helm for this one but then I found out he was busy making Superman Returns. I watched it a few more times and I found my hate slowly oozing away from my heart. Now I cant get enough to this day. Im still hooked!...
B002N5N5QQ|3.0|It's surprising how such a promising show could deteriorate so quickly.  It's clear that the writer tried to take it up a notch in the second season, but while the storyline may have been more exciting, the way it was told was not.  Plenty of unnecessary dialogue (why do writers assume we're idiots and need everything explained to us?), soap opera drama, and a cheesy, improbable finale presented merely to enhance a 'cliff ender' and ensure an audience for Season 3.  It all comes across as selfish and lazy to me, which is very disappointing.
0307454541|5.0|After a grueling semester in graduate school last spring, I really wanted something just mindless and fun to read (though perhaps not as mindless as a Dan Brown novel), and according to just about everyone everywhere, this was the fun read of the year. So, I tried it, and I think that all of the praise was justified. Once the Vanger murder was introduced in this book, I didn't put it down, and then, I got the whole Millennium series downed within the week.<br /><br />I like several things about this particular book. First, it works on one level as a fast-paced murder mystery. It's more Thomas Harris than Agatha Christie, but the puzzle of a plot really is satisfying--fantastic, but plausible enough for my tastes. And the atmosphere of the novel, too, which ties an old, faded, and crumbling world to a new, fast-paced, and corrupt reality, is also paradoxically enjoyable, feeling both nostalgic and fresh. And of course, the characters are endlessly fascinating: Lisbeth, the troubled anti-hero who we hope will find some redemption (or at least revenge) and the appealing Mikael, who seems always to be smarter and more charming than you think he's going to be. You somehow end up rooting for these people to bring a little bit of justice, in whatever form it can take, into the chaotic and grim world of the novel.<br /><br />It's not a perfect novel. There are really two plots going on, and the second one, involving Swedish finance (which takes up the beginning and ending of the novel), is definitely the forgotten, and lesser, one. This is, by no means, an entirely balanced story. The flaws, though, hardly overwhelm the story. It's a riveting story from almost beginning to almost the end, and it launches the fine (and better plotted) story that makes up the final two books. I think that these are excellent reads for those who like authors from Thomas Harris to John Le Carre.
B002ZHKZCO|5.0|Was skeptical at first but decided to give it a shot. Product arrived sooner than I thought. The condition of the product was pristine including box it came in. I will definitely be doing business with this seller in the future.
044654759X|5.0|I have always been a big fan of Nicholas Sparks, when first starting this book I never would have expected it to take the twist that it did.  Of course it does have it traditional love story which Nicholas Sparks is famous for, but it comes with a new and wonderfully written twist.  I would recommend this book to anyone that is a Nicholas Sparks fan or to who ever would just like to read a good book by a good writer, and trust me the twist at the end will leave you in aww.
0393068382|4.0|This is a great book that makes the reader think about the biases that start just from checking the box marked \\"male\\" or \\"female\\" on any survey.  From there, all our expectations of \\"how\\" we should behave or be perceived begin.  This book clearly points out those expectations and beliefs are mostly false and based on biased research.   It is very well written.  My only 'complaint' is that I wish some of the research would have been described in more detail.  However, the author has an EXTENSIVE and VERY UP TO DATE Bibliography that can be used by those who would like to read the original peer-reviewed literature.
B002JTHFUS|5.0|This product is outstanding as all of the U2 products. I love then. They are an inspiration for me. It's the greatest band i've ever heard. The songs are perfect. U2 forever
B0042FZWC0|1.0|I have a hard time believing I read the same book as the rest of the reviewers.<br /><br />The first problem I have with this book is that it's not three books. I suspect that if the book were split into three, the result would be much better. An autobiography of the author could be interesting. A book on how to travel well and on the cheap would be useful. A book on the art and virtue of non-conformity could be good. Instead, we get one book that fails at all three.<br /><br />To me, the author came off as self-congratulatory if not condescending, and offered very little that is new or even interesting. The assumption is that if you're not living the way he is, you're doing something wrong.  His chapter on building your \\"small army\\" could just have easily been titled \\"how to put people in categories so you can mooch off of them.\\"<br /><br />I'm a huge fan of bucking trends and approaching life with a non-conformist view. All assumptions should be challenged. All authority should be questioned. There are many paths to many different goals. However, that's not what this book is about, and there is very little here for someone that doesn't want to make money by taking advantage of a \\"small army\\".<br /><br />The author advocates life-long learning (yay!) but thinks universities are pointless. (boo!) His main argument seems to be that since he was able to pass tests without learning anything, then the system is useless. Really? While it's true that the formal education system isn't for everyone, there are many thousands of people that have managed to take full advantage of the opportunities it presents. College isn't for everyone, and you have to try to use the system, not get around it, if you want to get anything out of it.<br /><br />There are many paths through life, and many ways to embrace non-conformity. The dreaded cubicle life can be one of soul-sucking boredom, or you can make a lot of friends, litter the office with desktop nerf dart cannons, all while working towards a common goal. Many paths to the same goal.<br /><br />The worst part is the that book starts off so promising. The first couple of chapters are a brilliantly motivational introduction. Too bad the book never gets around to delivering.
0307463745|5.0|This book contains essays on different topics based on the experiences of the authors. Some of their poimts are very unconventional and may strike you as odd or even crazy. Looking at their success and some other companies that use similar strategies it's obvious that their methods can work.     If you plan on making a startup, or just want to improve your productivity as a worker then this is a must read. It's not very long and it's structure makes it a very easy read.     I found the book to be very inspiring. Almost all essays contain a real life example of another company implementing these unconventional methods/strategies and how they made them work.
B002RWKSII|3.0|had expected more, in light of a critique i've read. too close to a nice evening music, too un-exciting, not really doing any good to Gershwin's wonderful melodies.
B000Y179KO|5.0|This audio CD was ordered for my deceased husband who was an Eagle fan since the sixties. I also listened to it and thought it was great in lyrics and composition. It was sent to my younger brother for further enjoyment. I must protest this date of September 2010 as my husband died in 2008 and he listened to it many times.
