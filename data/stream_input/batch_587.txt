B000EULJLU|5.0|I wasn't expecting much from Tool, I mean five years later and they still have their touch? Sure enough I was blown away and impressed that Tool continues to enlighten the current music culture. People that are bashing this album were expecting another AEnima. The album just flew way over their heads. I also think that this is better than Lateralus. All of the musical tracks suck you in like an undertow and won't let go until it's finally over. 10,000 Days is the album for any Tool fan. If you're expecting another AEnima, you might want to take second thoughts. The CD packaging is really neat too, you'll have to see it for yourself.    1. Vicarious 10/10 - The first single off the album and it works. It begins with a repetive guitar riff that lasts about 40 seconds. Once the riff is over you can tell the song is going to go somewhere. When the song kicks in there is no escape. It's a really good song with a catchy lyrics. Danny really rips the drums in this song, especially towards the songs end. There is also a Schism-esque to it.    2. Jambi 9/10 - Another instant classic. Starts off with copter-like short chops at the guitar. It begins with a calmer side, but after a few chorus' it erupts and falls into a catchy beat. At this point Maynard starts to use the voice box, which is a cool addition to the song. It goes on for a little too long, but in the long run it's a great addition to the song. An classic off the album, bound to be liked.    3. Wings For Marie (Part 1) 9/10 - Wow. This song might be one of my favorites on the album. It begins with almost silence with these little bounces. When the main riff begins it's hard to let go. It's very calm and nothing like the last two tracks. It's a song to relax to and enjoy. The song has sadness to it, because it speculates about Maynard's mother Judith Maire Keenan who was paralyzed. When the song slowly spirals to an end it leads into...    4. 10,000 Days (Wings Part 2) 9/10 - Part two of an amazing two parter. Thisone has a lot more energy to it. It is a buildup song which finally releases it's energy. It's an 11 minute song so give it some time to sink in. It has the same riff but it seems to be a song more adrenaline to it. It's a great way to end the duet. After the main chorus it's pretty instrumental from there with some amazing guitar work from Jones.    5. The Pot 8/10 - \\"Who are you to wave your finger?\\" begins this track. It's a total mood change from WFM and TTD. It starts off with just vocals and when the guitar kicks in it explodes into a pure rock song. I think it's a cross between Vicarious and Jambi. There's not much more to it.    6. Lipan Conjuring 3/10 - I realize it's a filler, but it throws the flow of the album off track. It's pretty much Mantra with spoons and little tings with tribal chanting in the background. Skip it, nothing special.    7. Lost Keys (Blame Hoffman) 5/10 - A conversation between a nurse and a LSD patient. It's kind of a filler, but it's cool to listen to because it gives Rosetta Stoned a purpose.    8. Rosetta Stoned - 8/10 Reminds me of Ticks & Leeches. Picks off right where Lost Keys ends. It's an 11 minute rock song with some quick singing. The way Maynard sings the song makes him seem like he's sick, or in this case a patient. Has some moments like Jambi. This is a song to blast on your headphones. The voice box is used in this song.    9. Intension 6/10 - I just don't like it. Sounds like APC too much. It's almost a techno version of Wings For Marie. Very calm and nothing sticks out. It's a hit or miss song.    10. Right In Two 10/10 - The ballad. It's an amazing song that starts off peacefully and explodes at the end. A song with some great guitar work and drum work. It's a song that you can't turn away from.    11. Viginti Tres 6/10 - \\"Thirty-three\\" is a weird way to end the album. It's weird static and wind noises. It's almost like it had auido recording of a hurricane. It's a cross between Faaip De Oaid and (-) Ions. It doesthe trade off where it switches speaker sides with weird noises. It's a cool track to listen to and it wasn't a bad way to end it off. Towards the middle though it gets a little hectic and picks up. You'll have to hear it for yourself.    10,000 Days is an album for any Tool fan. Buy it, it's worth every penny.
B0000A1RJI|5.0|While the layout of the songs make little sense, the composition itself is amazing!  A clear masterpiece by Hans Zimmer!  I know it says that it is by Klaus Badelt, but if you look on the CD, it says that Hans Zimmer was part of the composition and you can pick up bits of his artistic talent while listening to it.  Try listening to a few songs from his other works, such as Gladiator or King Arthur.  You'll see what I mean. <br /> <br />This has to be one of my favorite soundtracks.  As soundtracks are pretty much all I have on my Zen (it's an mp3 player for all of you \\"iPods are the world\\" people ;) ), I listen through them a lot, and Pirates is the one I can always seem to go back to.  It's the perfect mood for any time, whereas some soundtracks you just have to be in a certain mood. <br /> <br />If you're thinking of buying it, just get it.  It's worth it a million times over!
B00005K3NY|5.0|One of croneberg's best, if you liked Videodrome I recommend you see this. After hearing so much about this Head scene I was kinda disapointed in it but it was still well done, But the movie was even more well done. I dont think this movie hasent aged well its a classic sci-fi horror that you cant go wrong with, and \\"Way ahead of our time\\".
B000ETQRCM|4.0|The self angst and anger that permeated Pearl Jam's earlier work is here, directed toward the war (actually, war in general) and a president whom they despise. But those who are looking for  empty-headed sloganeering and sneering  discontent will be disappointed. Pearl Jam forges it's forceful, hard edged rock with lyrics that make you couple images and ideas together.  They make their point without being condenscending or insulting (I'm sure Eddie Vedder will save that sort of thing for his on-stage rantings that we've all grown to know and love), unlike sections of their previous studio release \\"Riot Act\\".  It's not perfect by any means (\\"Parachutes\\" is a bit flimsy, while \\"Big Wave\\" is strictly nonessential), but when you have powerhouse numbers like \\"Life Wasted\\", \\"World Wide Suicide\\", \\"Unemployable\\" and what may be the best thing they've recorded in years, \\"Inside Job\\", you can't go wrong.
B000002UA2|5.0|Obscured By Clouds deserves a lot more credit than it gets, and it's sad. While this CD has no standouts, it has a very solid lineup.  It earns five stars because any CD with nothing bad on it deserves a lot of credit. <br /> <br />Obscured by Clouds: a very, very good instrumental 4.5/5 <br /> <br />When You're in: another good instrumental 4/5 <br /> <br />Burning Bridges: a beautiful song about nuclear warfare (Hiroshima/Nagasaki specifically, at least that is what I think), one of the best on the album 4.5-5/5 <br /> <br />The Gold It's In The...: Not my favorite style of music, but then again, PF makes me like almost everything they do. 4/5 <br /> <br />Wot's...Uh The Deal: If nothing else, you've got to love the title, and the lyrics, and the music, and, well, just about everything. 4.5/5 <br /> <br />Mudmen: an instrumental version of Burning Bridges, longer, but not as good. 4/5 <br /> <br />Childhood's End: About, well, I'm not sure, but it's very good. 4.5/5 <br /> <br />Free Four: My personal favorite on the album. I love me a good song about death set to the happiest tune out there. 4.5-5/5 <br /> <br />Stay: I'm not sure about this song, but it is loaded with potential, so I'll give it a tentative 4/5 <br /> <br />Absolutely Curtains: Another good instrumental closer. I love the title, but the chanting is a bit grating.  This one could be better, and is the worst on the album. 3.5/5 <br /> <br />It is very hard to find a Cd with a more consistent lineup than this. It's one of five albums I can think of with no weak songs (others being Meddle, Dark Side of the Moon, Animals, Wish You Were Here, notice a trend anybody). <br /> <br />Pink Floyd is the best band not only because of the heights their best work reached, but because the quality of the stuff in the middle of their catalogue is equal to the highs of most other bands, if not much better.   <br />  <br />This album is right in the middle of what PF has done, and it is better than what most bands reach in their prime.
B000063COX|5.0|To some Iron Maiden are a joke, well because to them heavy metal itself is a joke (whereas other bands like for example Coldplay, U2 are the modern day Beatles) and there's not much point in trying to convince them how incredible something like Seventh Son of a Seventh Son is.    But this album is a whole different thing, before Maiden evolved into a more \\"traditional\\" metal sound. This is before the time of Bruce Dickinson and Number of the beast, when Paul Di'anno with his shorter hair, more raw, slightly punk style vocals was the leader. There is simply no way you can dislike this album, no one sang with that much feeling and sincerity, no one more determined than Steve Harris (who wrote nearly all the songs here) to lead his band to true greatness. This comes from a time when Iron Maiden had SOUL, not something that metal music in general is associated with. The Maiden signature sound is present from day one, but the song writing and playing is of a higher standard, whether it's Harris bass lines, Clive Burr's (one of rock's most criminally overlooked drummers) grooves or Dave Murray's Hendrix influenced, unstructured soloing. When Paul Di'anno sang no one listening to it is left in any doubt that he felt how he sang. If you can't feel the being of Remember Tommorow and Strangeworld you have no soul. Dennis Stratton's opening solo on the latter track (atleast I think that's him) is out of this world and should rank as one of the best guitar solo's written for it's emotion if not complexity. Sad he was fired after the first Maiden album because his evolving music style was at odds with the bands.     Then there's the rockers Prowler, Running Free, Charlotte, Sanctuary. Any album with a string of songs like these could only be called classic. A band nowadays could build their career with just one of these songs. And ofcourse there's the first of their long epics, Phantom of the opera which despite it's subject is not a cheese fest like Webber's awful music. This is one of Maiden's definitive moments one that would influence scores of musicians worldwide in the decades since.    This is an incredibly powerful album, there has been no rock/metal album that has mattered as much as this since that time (all due respect to people like Nirvana, Radiohead, Metallica, but sorry you never stood a chance against Maiden circa 1979-88. Maiden's debut stands at the pinnacle of greatness, it's as essential listening as Led Zeppelin I & II.
B000024D4R|5.0|Roger Waters wrote all of Pink Floyd's Lyrics after Obscured By Clouds.  This album is no exception. <br /> <br />The CD opens with the short, sweet, Pigs on the Wing (Pt. 1).  The song was a love song written by Waters for his then-wife.  It is a about people with no empathy, who are Pigs on the Wing.  In flying terms, a Pig on the Wing is an enemy fighter in your blind spot. 5/5 <br /> <br />PotW(1) is followed by Dogs, the longest song on the album.  About greedy, corrupt, money-grubbing backstabbers, it is among Waters' best lyrical achievements.  Add that to excellent music, excellent vocals, and the ingenious idea of playing dogs barking on Wright's keyboard, and you have a masterpiece. <br /> <br />Then comes Pigs (3 Different Ones).  This song is about one kind of pig, and two specific ones.  The first stanza is about the greed of capitalists (with your head down in the pig bin, sayin' keep on diggin', pig stain on your fat chin, what do you hope to find, down in the pig mine).  The second pig (second stanza) is about Margaret Thatcher, who Waters absolutely despised, as evidenced in the Final Cut.  The third stanza is about Mary Whitehouse.  I do not know who she is, but I would guess she was a censor (you're trying to keep our feelings off the street. <br /> <br />Following this is Sheep, about an uprising of the poeple.  This song is over ten minutes, like the previous two, but not nearly as good.  The album closes with PotW(2), which finishes the album much as it began, in excellence.
1592401791|1.0|This is the biggest literary disappointment I have ever experienced.    If you are assuming that the studio engineer who spent the best part of 4 to 5 years (on and off) as the Beatles sound engineer has written a book with the minutia of the studio and the recording process, the guitars used, the mics, the keyboards, the sessions that went well and those that didn't, mistakes that worked, real studio stories (rather than the same ones that Macca brings out every time he's interviewed by Michael Parkinson) ... all the great stuff that is just touched on in the Lewishon books ....., then you'll be sadly mistaken.    Yeah there are snippets of information that are interesting, but if you are into the Beatles in such a way that the above described information is what you're looking for, then don't waste your money as I did with this book.  Stick with the books by Lewishon and the Doug Suply book on the GET BACK sessions.    I have read more informative books on the Beatles by people who weren't even there.    Also the personal attacks he makes on other members of the Abbey road staff (viz: Chris Thomas) are just not called for.  It is one thing to describe an argument that occurred, but to be vitriolic and personal is not on. Further his continual suggestion that he was the \\"hero\\" in this fairy tale we all know as \\"the Beatles\\" wears very thin after it is used the 3rd or 4th time.     It is also apparent from his book that he had little regard for George or Ringo.    If I could ask for my money back, I would.
B000ETQRCM|5.0|This album is great! I got an advance copy Monday morning and I've been listening to it non-stop ever since. It's more rocking than their past few releases have been. Don't get me wrong, I don't think Pearl Jam has ever made a bad album, but they went off on an experimental bent that made their albums more interesting, but gave them less staying power (at least in my CD player). I can't really pick a favorite song, everyone on here is amazing. It's not like their early albums where I would go to my favorite tracks first and then listen to the rest of the album, I listen to the whole thing from beginning to end and then restart it.
B000002UAU|5.0|If you are like me and you love to put the Beatles into periods or \\"sound categories\\". If so, then the Summer of 67's release of Sgt Pepper is at the peak of their Psychedelic sound period.  <br /> <br />Pre-1965, the Boys were hinting at a more experimental drug induced sound, but it wasn't as purposeful as on the 1965 relwase of Rubber Soul. With tracks like \\"Norwegian Wood\\" and \\"The Word\\", the Beatles were discovering new dimensions, litterally. However, 1966's Revolver LP is by far considered to be the album that proved what some had already known...The Beatles were taking LSD. They changed, their music had changed, and they wanted to change the listener. <br /> <br />It is only natural then that Sgt Pepper would come along. Well, all was not well in Beatledom. In 1966 John made an offhand comment about the Beatles being bigger than Jesus. Touring had already proved redundant and phsycially exhausting. Relationships were strained and drugs were consumed. In fact, John had felt he would've given up being a Beatle if not for the others mainly Paul. John had always been the strong was, but he could no longer be bothered to lead the group. <br /> <br />Here's were the impossible happens! Now, I am a John guy, but the following passage is written because it is the truth. Paul seized the moment of John's faltering ego and developed the concept for the Pepper art and musical direction, not to mention assisting with mixing. Pepper was an earth shattering experience! Paul was responsible and he made it known. The Beatles would never be the same. Oh, they did hit many other peaks musically, but Pepper was like coming to the crossroads. <br /> <br />Side note: <br /> <br />The Beatles, up to 1966, main composers were, John Lennon with 40 songs, 29 for McCartney and 14 Lennon/McCartney.  <br /> <br />You can see John had a firm grip on the group as leader and creative director.  <br /> <br />After Revolver, an LP which Paul had more songs than John (by 1), Paul had 41 songs! John 33 and 3 Lennon/McCartney (I know they are all Lennon/McCartney). <br /> <br />It was all downhill from here. The Beatles kept falling apart. Still great records like The White Album and Abbey Road. But the story is not worth mentioning unless you want me to get upset. And possibly upset others. <br /> <br />Now go buy Sgt Pepper (Revolver is better).
B000EULJLU|2.0|Pros: When the songs started rockin they were as good as Tool has ever been. Heavy and caotic. It's what you expect from Tool. Very musical. <br /> <br />Cons: %25 hard rock. %75 intro/sound effects. You know how Tool has some long intros before the song gets going? Some of the songs were just intros that never built to the song. Just tracks where the instruments played the same thing over and over with voices in the background. There was a stupid song that was just tribal voices that never turned into anything. Followed by a track of sound effects. You'd think that they could've wrote more than 6 or 7 actual songs in 5 years. track 10 came and I was thinking, \\"Okay 2 more songs to change my epinion.\\" Track 10 was great. Track 11 was just dumb sound effects.  <br /> <br />Maybe someday they'll release a greatest hits cd with their best songs. Then you won't have to waste money on a cd that is half sound effects that they thought were cool. I want to hear music when I buy cds!
B000EMGAGW|2.0|THIS AINT GOT NUTTIN' TO DO WITH ME HAITNG G-UNIT OR NONE OF THAT BULL****, I LOVE MOBB DEEP MAN, THEY MY ALL TIME FAV, BUT BY FAR THIS HAS TO BE THERE WORST ALBUM YET ( WITH THE SONG EXCEPTION OF PEARLY GATES)...I EVEN LIKED \\"INAFAMY\\" AND \\"AMERICAZ NIGHTMARE\\" MORE THAN THIS ALBUM, AND THOSE BEING THERE SOFTEST LPS YET. I AINT HATING I THINK WE JUST NEED TO SPEAK THE TRUTH, AND JUST HOPE FOR SOMETHING BETTER. I AGREE WITH HOMMIE SAYING THERE WILL NEVER BE ANOTHER INFAMOUS ECT. ECT.... BUT THE REST OF YOU SAYING THESE DUDES SELL OUTS, YALL CRAZY...BUT I DO BELIEVE THEY SLIPPED ON THIS ONE, AND ALL WE CAN DO IS HOPE FOR BETTER IN THE FUTURE...
B000E8NQUE|5.0|Even though the SACD is ONLY the original album, you have to get this one for the extras. To hear the different mixes and takes is absolutely wonderful. They've adjusted the liner inserts to reflect the new work which is really interesting. Since there is no DTS of this as far as I know, the SACD is an excellent move. Justin worked on these reissues, and I hope he decides to put out tons of the alternate takes and leave the original issues alone. Maybe Mike can open his archives for new clips? GET THIS!
0375507256|5.0|I am a very selective reader. I don't read much that is not music or about music. This is the best book I have read for a long time and the first I have reread since The Magic Mountain. <br />The central idea is 'souls cross ages as clouds cross skies'. It draws an intricately interlinked narrative arc from the newly discovered South Pacific of the 1850s to Europe back to the Pacific over several centuries stretching into our future, through technological dystopias - and more positive - some  technological -  views of our human future. <br />Of course there is loads of (fictional) music in it. The eponymous Cloud Atlas suite of the title deserves to exist outside of fiction. Maybe one day it will. <br />I believe this book will be read in centuries' time. I hope so.
B000067CPX|2.0|And yes I am bitter. I'm bitter becasue as a kid I remember that the Chili Peppers were that out of control messed up brand of punk-soul fusion that made everything seem better through it's magical filter. Uplift Mofo, Freaky Style and the S/T where amazing displayes of energy and soul. Part of me wishes that \\"Under The Bridge\\" was never written. It seems like ever since they have slipped further and further downhill. There are enough crappy pop-punk-jazzhop albums out there without the Chili Peppers recording something like \\"By the Way\\", Unlike the above mentioned albums that I still listen to 10 years later, this newest instalment is instantly forgettable. I can't help but to think that when Hillel died a piece of the Chili Peppers died, and they've been lost ever since.
0060922583|4.0|Talbot is obviously a very mystic person. He believes in almost every aspect of the psychic realm from hauntings to miraculous spontaneous healings to psychokinesis and \\"mental time travel\\". In this book, he covers every iota of psychic powers in a very detailed and methodical way, and relates those paranormal activities to his theory that the world is a hologram. After reading his argument, the theory definitely fits the problem and cannot be easily explained away. Of course, like all theories that seem definitive and true in the present, the future dictates which theories survive. Is it possible the universe is a hologram? Yes, but is it probable? Maybe. The most interesting chapter speaks of the incredible amount of evidence supporting spontaneous healing and the placebo effect. Essentially that there exists tons of evidence of healing through faith and the mind, belief that one can and will be healed...even diseases such as cancer. It may be a far stretch to relate healing to a holographic reality but Talbot does a fine job covering the bases. Very interesting and thought-provoking. Especially for those who are thirsty for knowledge and humbly admit that everyone has knowledge to share.
B000002U82|5.0|Imagine yourself in an insane asylum.  You might hear some of this: <br /> <br />\\"I've been mad for f****** years.  Absolutely.\\" <br />\\"I've always been mad, I know I've been mad.  You have to explain why you're mad, even if you're not mad.\\" <br />\\"Here for today, gone tommorrow.  That's me.  Hahahahahahaha\\" <br />\\"I don't know, I was really drunk at the time.\\" <br />\\"Give him a short, sharp shock and he won't do it again.  Dig it?\\" <br />\\"Why should I be afraid to die?  There's no reason for it.  You've got to go sometime.\\" <br />\\"There is no dark side of the moon, really.  Matter of fact, it's all dark\\" <br /> <br />Or you might just be listening to the most groundbreaking album of all time, in the comfort of your own room.  And I haven't even gotten to the highlights yet, to the music that made it happen. <br /> <br />The album opens with Speak To Me/Breathe.  Speak To Me introduces the album with the heartbeat from Eclipse, the clocks from Time, the engine from On the Run, the money sounds from Money, and the screaming from The Great Gig in the Sky.  After the screaming subsides, the music starts, as we transition into Breathe, about being born, and advice on how you live your life. <br /> <br />Next up is On The Run, a frenetic instrumental about paranoia.  It could be paranoia like that which overtook Stalin, who felt the world was out to get him, or it could just be the simple paranoia a person feels running to get to a flight. <br /> <br />Time follows, and is about people who think life lasts forever, and before they know it, end up to old to live, without having ever done anything meaningful.  It ends with a reprise of Breathe, about a funeral. <br /> <br />This leads into The Great Gig in the Sky, the second instrumental on the album.  This particular one is about death, as can be seen in the \\"why should I be afraid to die\\" quote above.  Clare Torry's shrieks of desperation are unrivalable, when anyone else even attempts it, it sounds like sex, the exactopposite of death. <br /> <br />Money follows, with the absolutely amazing technical achievement of the looping cash register/coins clinking/paper tearing sequence, all leading to an almost reggae (although much better) song about the evils of money, with the almost paradoxical line (money, it's a crime, share it fairly but don't take a slice of my pie). <br /> <br />There is a brief interim period in the last fifteen seconds of this song and the first five of the next in which one of the most amazing song lyrics ever appears twice (once in each song).  \\"I don't know, I was really drunk at the time.\\" <br /> <br />This leads into Us and Them, the most moody song on the album.  It's about the evils of war, and the little things we never think about, like how the soldiers on the other side are only human, too. <br /> <br />Next up is Any Colour You Like, an instrumental.  However, like every song on the album, this too has a meaning.  It is about racism, and how it doesn't really matter what color you are, you can still be a productive member of society (and you can still go insane). <br /> <br />Brain Damage follows, the culmination of all of the previous songs.  It's about how the person finally cracks, and is sent to the insane asylum (or the dark side of the moon) where he can be with all the other people like him. <br /> <br />Eclipse rounds off the album, summing up all the factors that make you go insane, ending with: \\"and all that is now, and all that is gone, and all that's to come, and everything under the sun is in tune, but the sun is eclipsed by the moon\\" (eclipse were thought to cause seizures). <br /> <br />Put this all together, and you have the best concept album ever conceived, about all the factors that lead a man to insanity: <br />paranoia, thinking about time and growing old, worrying about death, wondering if you have enough money, the stress of war, and racism. <br /> <br />Now imagine yourself in a theatre.  Not a movie theatre, but an honest-to-god theatre, where real people do real live acting for your benefit.  You're there to see a play.  On the stage is a chair, with a table next to it.  On the table is a cd player, in the chair is a man, hanging his head, so you can't see his face.  The play you're going to see is called \\"The Soundtrack to Life.\\" <br /> <br />In the play, the man lifts up his head, picks up his arm, and presses one button on the cd player.  After five seconds of silence, in which the man returns to his original position, you begin to hear a heartbeat, followed by some clocks, and an engine, the sounds of money, and some shrieks.  And then the first note of Breathe comes on. <br /> <br />Who is the man?  You are the man.  After you hang your head, close your eyes for the next 42 minutes or so. <br /> <br />You'll get your money's worth. <br /> <br />So sit back, relax, and enjoy the show.  And please, no smoking. Pink Floyd is not drug music.  This CD will take you anywhere you want to go on its own.
B000063V8T|5.0|TNG seasons 4 & 5 just dropped to $55 each. It happened this week.<br /><br />Last week I think the price was $160 to $170.<br /><br />I knew patience would pay off.
B000002UA0|5.0|A lot of Pink Floyd fans don't know about Syd Barrett, the genious behind this album.  While this album is certainly not as good as what would come under the direction of Roger Waters, this is still amazing, especially for a debut album. <br /> <br />This album was recorded at the same time as the Beatles' Sgt. Pepper's, and this one is much better. <br /> <br />The album opens with Astronomy Domine, a song with the closest to gibberish for lyrics Syd Barrett ever came (contrary to popular opinion, Syd did actually write coherent lyrics), and it absolutely amazing.  From the opening beeping to the excellent line, \\"stairway scare dan dare who's there\\" to the closing that brings everything to an end, this song is pure genious. 5/5 <br /> <br />Following this is Lucifer Sam, a song dedicated to Syd Barrett's girlfriend of the time.  If only all modern love songs were more like this. 5/5 <br /> <br />Next comes Matilda Mother, one of Syd Barrett's best works, and perhaps my favorite on the album. 5/5 <br /> <br />Flaming is next, and it is an extremely freaky song, but once you get past that, it's the fourth consecutive example of genius on this album. 4.5/5 <br /> <br />The next two tracks are my least favorite on the album.  Pow R. Toc H. is the least moving of all of Syd Barrett's songs, and only earns 2.5/5.  Next is Take Up Thy Stethoscope and Walk, one of Roger Waters'worst lyrical efforts, but has an excellent instrumental ending, which redeems the song enough to earn 3.5/5. <br /> <br />The next song returns to form.  Interstellar Overdrive is considered to be the psychadelic experience, and it is amazing. This song was written by all of the band members.4.5/5 <br /> <br />Then comes The Gnome, another good song, but weak in comparison to the rest.  A little bit childish. 4/5 <br /> <br />Following this is Chapter 24, an underrated song that is inspired by the Tao/Dao. 4/5 <br /> <br />Next up is the Scarecrow, a folksy tune that I greatly enjoy, although it could be better, I suppose. 4/5 <br /> <br />The last song is Bike, and it is my favorite.  It is another love song, about a boy who will do anything to get a girl's attention.  Absolutely Barrett (which, if you read the title, is synonamous with about a 9.5 on a scale of one to ten). <br /> <br />Thank you for your time, and I'm sure Amazon thanks you for your money and Pink Floyd for your support.
B00003CXPD|5.0|I won't write a long review for this movie, but I will say I wasn't expecting much from this film. What I got was one of the best movies I have seen in years. If you want a film that is 'off the beaten path', one that is a 'feel-good' movie without all the sappy Hollywood cliches, THIS IS THE MOVIE YOU NEED TO SEE. A great story, charming without being sappy, heartfelt without the cliches, Billy Elliot is a SUPERB movie. A truly inspiring story. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!

B000063V8R|5.0|Who would have guessed? After a DISASTEROUS first season, and a not much better second season, who would have thought that Next Generation's third season would be a tour-de-force of great acting and storytelling? And yet, that's exactly what happened. Coming off the writers' strike of season 2, Season 3 roared out of the gate with the return of Gates McFadden as Dr. Crusher. Season 2 had seen Crusher replace by the hated Dr. Pulaski, whose Enterprise tenure was thankfully only one season. In addition, Whoopie Goldberg as Guinan was featured prominently as a supporting character in this season, which added immeasurably to the ensemble cast dynamic. The introduction of Worf's continuing Klingon saga in this season was the start of Next Generation's continuing storylines, and the dark nature of the Klingon story arc was fantastic. In addition, the scriptwriters and the actors finally 'found' the characters after two wildly uneven seasons, and the classic portrayal of the Next Generation characters would begin right here in season 3. The true shining moments of season 3, however, are the cliffhanger season finale (which truly introduces the Borg after a cameo appearance in season 2), and one of the greatest Star Trek episodes of all time: Yesterday's Enterprise (featuring the return of Denise Crosby as Tasha Yar). Add in the expanded characterization of all the main cast, the SUPERB storylines, and the fact that there is not a single bad (or even average!) episode in this season, and you get the finest single year Star Trek has ever seen. Season 3 single handedly turned Next Generation into a television legend. If you like sci-fi, Next Generation's season 3 is an absolute MUST OWN. Following up season 3 was the equally impressive season 4, which is also mandatory viewing. HIGHEST POSSIBLE RECOMMENDATION!

B00005M91K|5.0|I must admit I do not own the DVD of this film. I was flipping through my HD channels the other evening and caught it right from the beginning. Look for it on INHD and Tivo it, as I did.  <br /> <br />I realized very quickly there wasn't any narration or text, however I was immediatly drawn in to it and could not look away. The mesmerizing music does go very well with the vivid photography, as mentioned in previous posts here. I'm not going to get into all of the details of the film, since there are so many reviews that include this, however I would like to express my thoughts in general. The photography is, in one word, amazing. Sit back on your couch and tour exotic places in the world we only dream about. Notice the comparisons of assembly line production and commuters in the modern business world. For those viewers who were appalled by the scenes of poverty, the baby chickens, etc., this is the real world. And whether or not you choose to aknowledge these things, they exist. Frankly, in my mind, they are beautiful, as is this film.
B00008OLIO|5.0|the only Crue album that i own and for good reason! on Too Fast For Love, the band sounds raw, crazed, and hungry! in other words...unstoppable! this is a classic album full of hot-blooded songs that rock with more of a trashy glam strut than a heavy metal vibe. owing more to New York Dolls than most of their contemporaries, the songs and the style are all killer. production is really raw and sounds like they might have recorded these in a garage, but that's what i like about it...very young and adolescent sounding. the drumming has some really peculiar production techniques applied to it...(just why is that overdubbed cowbell so loud? haha!), but in the end, the strange production adds a nice touch to it...a unique kind of gonzo charm. i like it. the bonus tracks on here are all pretty good but only their version of \\"Tonight\\" (originally peformed by The Rasberries) stands out as something truly special. great cd!
B0000BWVCM|4.0|This was a wonderful adaptation of the beloved comic books. I enjoyed the first film a lot, but this was more up my alley... darker, more emotional, awesome effects and really cool characters. Nightcrawler was AMAZING, and I really liked Iceman too. The effects were definitely heightened for this flick, and &lt;wonder of wonders> Mystique actually had lines! I enjoyed the sequence between Wolverine and Lady Deathstrike immensely, I kept thinking \\"I want her fingernails!\\"<br /><br />The only thing I really didn't like was the ending... it didn't seem to fit in my mind, but I suppose they had to set up for X3 somehow. It was a fun ride!
B000EULJLU|4.0|You probably shouldn't believe the hyperbole on either side.  The truth is that Lateralus was a far more cohesive album, both musically and lyrically.  My first impression (based on about 3 full listen throughs) is that this album isn't really a step forward for the band, so much as it is a maintenance of the status quo.  Don't get me wrong, when the disc is awesome... it's AWESOME (Vicarious, Jambi, The Pot are initial standouts in my mind).  Please keep that in mind when you read the following. <br /> <br />Lyrically I haven't found this album to be nearly as impressive as previous releases.  If Lateralus was all extended metaphor and innuendo, 10,000 Days is a sledghammer upside the head (see Right in Two and Vicarious).  A lot of the contemplative mood and humor survive from Lateralus, but we also add in a healthy dose of the anger of Undertow and Aenima which had all been focused into Ticks and Leeches on Lateralus. <br /> <br />The best songs in terms of lyrics on the album are Wings for Marie and 10,000 Days.  However, this brings up another problem for me.  I saw TOOL on the Lateralus tour and they did an intermission where Adam Jones stood and played a little three note riff from one of the songs over and over for about 5-10 minutes while the rest of the band took a breather.  That's fine for the live show.  But too much of 10,000 Days (the song) sounds like that extended intermission riff, it just repeats for a really long time.  That's a problem, because I never felt like anything in Lateralus or in the substantive portions of Aenima was like that. <br /> <br />In any event, I'd like to close by reassuring fans (as if you haven't bought this album already) that the CD is really, really good.  It's also worth noting that TOOL songs usually grow on me with time as I discover all of the nuanced stuff that's going on (that's my hope for 10,000 Days) that's not readily apparent on the first few listens.  Finally, a recommendation:  If this is the first TOOL purchase you are considering, buy Lateralus and then branch out.  You'll appreciate this much more by starting elsewhere.
0596009208|4.0|This book will not be for everyone. The layout and teaching style may turn you off and that is ok. Everyone learns differently.    The book does cover a lot of ground, perhaps too much but more or less does so in enough depth to make this book attractive to novices and intermediate programmers.     I have two main complaints:    1. The GUI section is extremely weak. The jukebox is not as much of an example of writing a solid, good looking GUI as it is a 'whee look what I can do' example. Granted using Swing is a topic for at least an entire book(and I hope a good HF GUI book is in the works), but the lack of useful examples of common components and the terrible layout managers makes this a section of the book easily skipped.    2. Some of the client/server examples in the networking chapter block permantantly. It compiles fine, but it blocks forever. There is not a deep enough discussion on IO and networking to make this a useful chapter.    Other then those two quibbles, which might be very minor depending on your point of view, this is a fun, generally well-written book that anyone should be able to use to great effect.
B000050FEN|5.0|This is one of the best editions ever. Being a graphic designer is great to have a high quality item like this on a DVD collection. Well, even if I wouldn't be a graphic designer I would love this edition.<br /><br />Of course is not only the amazing \\"diary-like\\" package, or the great amount of detail on it, the movie, the director, the great cast, the bonus material and special features makes it one of a kind edition.<br /><br />Highly recomendable!
B00005JNEI|5.0|Since copies of \\"Farenheit 9/11\\" are available inexpensively, I've been buying extra copies and giving them out to co-workers, second-hand stores, and to US troops serving overseas.  I've been pleasantly surprised by how thankful people in the military have been to receive a copy of this film.  Despite the immense effort of Pentagon PR firms (like the Rendon Group) to trash this film, there are simply too many powerful insights for it to be ignored (hence, all the rageful reviews from those who have been \\"Hannitized\\" or otherwise intellectually handicapped).  These insights anger war profiteers and moral cowards, but many free-thinking Americans can handle the truth.  For instance, the truth shared by George Bush in the film when, at a fat-cat fundraising gala, he tells the audience, \\"Some people consider you to be the elite, I consider you to be my base.\\"  A rare moment of honesty from the figure-head of corporate power, the chief gopher of Big Business. <br /> <br />To read the opinions that dozens of US military members and their families have of Moore and his work, check out \\"Will They Ever Trust Us Again,\\" a compilation of letters Moore has received from US troops.  I'm sure he could've also done a book of hate mail he has received, but those comments are so predictable and boring there wouldn't be much of a point to publishing the thoughts of self-righteous lemmings. <br />Much more interesting would be the thoughts of Iraqis on this film.  I'm sure they appreciate the efforts of US citizens to question an illegal invasion that has killed over 100,000 innocent people. <br />My only criticism of this DVD is that there is no option for Spanish subtitles.  Spanish speakers, including undocumented immigrants, are a growing part of our imperial forces.  They need access to the perspectives Moore provides in this important film. <br />Lastly, Moore is also featured in the award winning documentary, \\"The Corporation,\\" another DVD that helps to free our minds from establishment indoctrination.
0440236738|5.0|This is my first Harlan Coben book, and it will certainly not be the last.  This book had everything--good story line with lots of twists and turns.  Just when you thought you had it figured out, something happened to prove you wrong.  The characters in this book had you guessing until the last page.  Wow!  What a surprise ending.  This fast paced book is an excellent companion for a plane or the beach or poolside.
B00005JNX0|5.0|This is delightful family entertainment. There were more than a few chuckles, as well as a subtle lesson for children (and a reminder for adults), that the grass is not always greener on the other side. Our family especially enjoyed the antics of the penguins. The music is also well suited to the movie and compliments the energy of the animal characters. You'll be tempted to get up and dance. If you no longer have young children, buy and save this one for the grandkids...<br /><br />Chrissy K. McVay - Author
B00025ETIW|5.0|Three Cheers for Sweet Revenge, the sophomore album from My Chemical Romance, is one of the two best CDs I own. The other is I Brought You My Bullets, You Brought Me Your Love, their debut album. Revenge is a haunting and imaginative blend of melodies and appropriate tempos for each amazing song. Whether you are listening to the album all the way through, or rockin' out to your favorites, every single song on this album delivers incredibly beautiful vocals, haunting and metaphor-laden lyrics, energetic instrumentals, and a stirring message of hope. It is both sorrowful and revitalizing, haunting and melodic, and great to sing along to. I cannot say enough good things about this album.  <br /> <br />Helena- Probably the most well-known song by My Chemical Romance and one of the best songs I have ever heard. The change of tempo from the verses to the refrain makes this song one of the most powerful and beautiful on the album. The vocals are absolutely incredible, and the video is absolutely amazing. <br /> <br />Give 'Em Hell, Kid- Very fun song with great bass and a wonderful melody. Awesome to sing along to, and has one of the happiest beats on the album. (I will also add that it is currently #1 on my Top 25 Most Played on my iTunes, right above I'm Not Okay (I Promise) and Our Lady of Sorrows, although I love them all equally.) <br /> <br />To The End- Incredible guitar and striking lyrics. \\"Say goodbye to the hearts you break and all the cyanide you drank.\\" This song is based on a piece of literature, as is much of the band's material (including their band name). This is one of the most visual songs on the album and contains a ton of imagery. <br /> <br />You Know What They Do To Guys Like Us In Prison- Beautiful singing, and lyrics are humorous at times. (\\"I miss my mom!\\") Strong anti-homophobia message. Additional vocals by Bert McCracken of The Used only add to this song's magnificence.  <br /> <br />I'm Not Okay (I Promise)- The greatest teen anthem of all time. Many of the lyrics are drawn from Gerard Way's real-life experiences, and the message is easy to relate to. One of the greatest songs of all time and also has a very funny video. <br /> <br />The Ghost of You- The slowest song on the album, with a strong message about loss. This song gives me chills every time I hear it, and it is incredibly sorrowful and powerful. The video is also very appropriate and it only adds to the beauty of this song. <br /> <br />The Jetset Life Is Gonna Kill You- Chilling and beautiful song, and unique due to its fade-in drums and organ intro. It was chosen as my MCR song of the week for this week. \\"Slip into the tragedy, you've spun this chamber dry.\\" <br /> <br />Interlude- Although it is just under a minute long, this song deserves as much recognition as the rest of the songs on this album. It provides a beautiful transition from the first half of the album to the second half, from the more singalong half to the darker half. It also is the perfect song to introduce \\"Thank You For The Venom,\\" and I think of these two songs as a pair. <br /> <br />Thank You For The Venom- Has the best intro of the whole album. With the soft \\"Interlude\\" placed before it chronologically, it makes the intro even more pounding and spectacular. Amazing guitar and chilling lyrics. This is one of the most energetic songs on the album, and it is great for headbanging, singing along, dancing, moshing, and anything else you can think of! Favorite lyric: \\"Hallelujah, lock and load.\\" <br /> <br />Hang 'Em High- With a unique and spectacular intro that is reminiscent of the Old West, this song is anything but saloon material. It is energetic, fast-paced, melodic, and has incredible lyrics. Favorite lyric: \\"Mass convulsions, strike the choir, by the grace of God.\\" <br /> <br />It's Not A Fashion Statement, It's A F*cking Deathwish- Amazing song, with constant changes of tempo (especially near the end) that easily make this song great to play over and over again. It's hard, it's creepy, and it's an absolutely incredible song. \\"When in the end we'll fall apart, just like the leaves changing color... When you go, just know that I will remember you. I've lost my fear of falling, I will be with you, I will be with you!\\" <br /> <br />Cemetery Drive- One of my favorite songs of all time and one of the best songs on the album. The lyrics are the most haunting and moving out of any song I have ever heard. \\"Mark the grave, where the searchlight find us drinking by the mausoleum door, and they found you on the bathroom floor. I miss you, I miss you so far.\\" This song is stirring, and this one also gives me the chills. The way Gerard sings the words is unlike anything I have ever heard in my life. <br /> <br />I Never Told You What I Do For A Living- Awesome song, and awesome lyrics. (\\"Clean me off, I'm so dirty, babe! The kind of dirty where the water never cleans off the clothes...\\") It is the perfect ending to the perfect album. It closes everything very nicely and in the signature My Chemical Romance way, creepy and cool. <br /> <br />Revenge leaves you wanting more, and is easy to listen to over and over again. The range of emotions it elicits is absolutely incredible and is so easy to relate to. It has depressing lows, soaring and invincible highs, and leaves you feeling hopeful and satisfied. I cannot recommend this album highly enough.
B000EULJLU|5.0|Wow!! Like many other fellow TooL fans, I have been waiting for this album for 5 long years. Well....it finally came....and again I must say....WOW! You know a band is truly talented and on a different level when their music can progressively get better....even after a 5 year hibernation. This album is so unbelievably good....and the mixture of intelligence and creativity just radiates from every song. From the moment the first track Vicarious begins to play....you hear that signature sound of guitar and bass...then drums.....then Maynard.......and you know your back in the creative world of TooL. Whats great about this album is that after you listen to it a couple times and start to pick up on the vibe thats being projected, you completely get the sense that this was not an album made to add $ to the bands checking account, but instead you can tell that all these songs have been painstakingly crafted, thought out, and engineered to release 5 years worth of back building ideas, opinions, and musical growth. After this album I can say one thing......I am very proud of TooL!!!! They have continually been one of the most original, thought provoking, creativly honest bands ever. And after this album....which comes after a 5 year break....along with the fact that the bandmembers are getting older.....they have not only NOT lost a step...they have appeared to GAIN a step, by sounding more creative and polished than ever. TooL......You guys rock!!!!!
0688170528|5.0|I just wanted to say how much I enjoyed this book. It is the third Jodi Picoult book I have read and I think it is my favourite so far. I loved the emotion and really felt the love and connection between the two main characters. I do believe the ending was a little unrealistic but I was sort of glad it ended the way it did.
B000EULJLU|2.0|One great single, one or two relatively catchy songs that are still too long, and a whole lot of boring tracks that go nowhere. While it's not straight up bad or painful to listen to, it's definitely their worst album and sadly, it's pretty uninteresting. Frankly, in many spots it sounds more like A Perfect Circle than Tool. And all the recycled tricks, the pick scrapes, the echoey screams, the talk box... just tired. Still a great band, still great live, just not a fantastic album. Of course, most Tool fans are so diehard it will take them at least ten years to realize this but hey, whatever floats your toolboat.
B000EULJLU|5.0|This cd is underated especially because it takes about 10 listens to understand it. Give it a chance and you will be amazed.
B0002TX4QQ|4.0|This book is written in the voice of a mother whose son has just committed mass murder at his high school.  The mother reflects on her parenting ability through a series of letters she writes to her husband.  Through these letters, she tells the story of \\"Kevin\\" -- when he was born, how she felt, the troubles he encountered, etc.<br /><br />The letters are beautifully written and down-right honest.  The mother tends to get a little snobbish at times, but she discusses that facet of her personality as well.<br /><br />I enjoyed this book very much and recommend it highly.  This is not a book about a high school killing; it is a book about a mother's grief and guilt.
B0000AGWJ7|1.0|What I said.  Learn it, live it, love it.  Get a real job and move the hell out of your parents' living room and off of their sofa.
B0007XT87G|4.0|Alice In Chains - Dirt. Live - Throwing Copper. Pearl Jam - Ten. Tool - AEnima. What do all of these have in common? A few things. Naturally, all of them were written and created by bands peerless in their timelessness and talent, but the one amazingly cool and unfortunately sad link between all of them is that they are albums which were so great in their creation, the rest of the bands career would be held in the eyes of many to be nothing more than a comparison than their great master work, every other album which will probably never measure up to it in all its glory. Thankfully Porcupine Tree have, and hopefully always will, crank out the high quality music that they are known for, indescribably tasteful pop songs set against atmospheric psychedelia and dark, brooding edginess. But chances are they will never do it quite like they did on 2002's In Absentia, the prequel to Deadwing. And thats okay. I'll be satisfied listening to In Absentia on a more than likely daily basis for the rest of my life and probably never get bored of it. But Deadwing is a damn fine attempt at a follow-up. <br /> <br />While it doesn't have the atmosphere and vibe that made In Absentia the thought-rock masterpiece it was, Deadwing hits the mark perfectly in being a great rock album, full of memorable lyrics, unforgettable, soaring choruses, original song structures, and unparralleled musicianship. But anyone who has ever heard this band knows that every album of theirs has all those qualities and more. Deadwing is more of an expansion on the heavier qualities of PT's music, probably derived from bandleader Steven Wilson's musical relationships with Opeth (the vocalist of whom performs on tracks 1, 3, and 5) and Meshuggah, and 8 of the 10 tracks on Deadwing will succeed in rocking your balls off. <br /> <br />Opening with a hypnotic synth line which holds us in suspense for the massive sound explosion that is coming, the albums title track blasts out of the speakers in the form of a 9 minute exercise in all of PT's qualities mentioned above, reaching a musical orgasm in the form of a blistering guitar solo from experimental guest guitarist Adrian Belew. This and the highly popular and progressive 10 minute plus Arriving Somewhere (But Not Here) are the talk of the album, both starting off as intense, passionate, but touching rockers with ballad-like vocals and melodic solos before blasting the listener with an array of pummelling metal exercises in rhythm. The latter of the two tracks is destined to become classic PT, and its lyrics question what exactly is waiting for us after death, taking the lyrics to a higher level of personality. These themes, along with the croons of a broken heart fresh out of the losing end of a relationship form the themes of the album, a ghost story written by SW and filmmaker Mike Bennion. Religion is not spared the lyrical axe either on the scathing and ominous Halo. <br /> <br />The heaviness prevails throughout most of the album, Shallow and Open Car featuring two of the most anthematic choruses from the band yet, while the remixed version of Shesmovedon (hidden track) is an amalgamut of signature PT traits, a moving chorus, outstanding guitar playing, and a ripping guitar solo to close it out. The Start Of Something Beautiful is also a big step forward for PT in the way of blending trippy guitar imagery into what would be a typical, if quality, rock song. The two quieter numbers are the minority of the album, contrary to In Absentia, much of which was acoustic and melody based in contrast to the metal influence, the piano ballad of Lazarus hitting that soft spot in the bottom of my heart every time I hear it. <br /> <br />If you've never heard this band but are just starting to hear about them as their popularity grows, this and In Absentia are the best place to start, although I reccommend the latter more than anything else. All in all Deadwing is an admirable rock album which any band should be proud to even remotely come close to making anytime in their careers. Get it now before everyone hears about it.
B000EULJLU|5.0|Maynard has never sounded better than on \\"The Pot\\", streching his vocal reach to a new high.  Trust me, you have to hear it to believe it.  Maynard also exposes his personal life in \\"Wings for Marie\\" and \\"10,000 Days\\", which is about his mothers life and the struggle she went through in the 27 years of being paralyzed (27 years is about 10,000 Days, get it?).  \\"Right In Two\\" is by far the best track on the album, if you can't make it out, make sure to read the lyrics!  Make no doubt about it, the signature tool sound is there with unbelievable change-ups throughout the entire album.  Danny Carey has never sounded better then now on the drums, not to mention the unbelievable bass riffs. <br /> <br />On the note of what some are calling \\"Filler\\", ummm no, this is music and just because there aren't words in a song doesn't make it filler.  \\"Don't go for the meaning, go for the feeling!\\" is what Maynard said and trust me the feeling is great.  Even if you don't enjoy the \\"filler\\" the album packing is a work of art, complete with glasses and 3-d pictures, YAH. <br /> <br />NOW GO BUY THE ALBUM ALL YOU SILLY MONKEYS!
B000EULJLU|5.0|5 years after the release of Lateralus and 3 and a half since they last performed a live show, Tool finally has a new album out. And it's about damn time. As usual, the wait is more than worth it, and while, like many of my favorite albums, I didn't quite get it upon the first listen, subsequent, repeated listenings have revealed not only a more structurally complex record than anything in the bands catalog to date, but also lyrically one of vocalist Maynard Keenan's most personal offerings. So many influences have come together to form this sonically unique album that it becomes hard to pinpoint exactly what these guys were on, and/or listening to when they recorded it. 10,000 Days is still an expansion of the bands first four albums, the psychedelic edginess, hammering rhythmic full band attacks, long melodic solos that cut straight to the heart, and overall atmospheric nostalgic touch giving it that distinct Tool signature. The songs are now even more progressive than on the epic Lateralus, the structures rarely depending on repeating any one part of the song, no matter how good it is, but never lacking in hooks despite this and the truly heavy quality of the material, giving the songs an almost Opethian writing quality not present on any previous release, all of which still depended heavily on choruses to grab the listeners ear. The sometimes Middle Eastern feel of the instrumental passages stay true to drummer Danny Carey's tribal tom assaults with a flair for tabla and exotic percussion, and Adam Jones use of a talk box for his guitar solo on Jambi is exceptionally prog-rock-ish and hints at a (if very slight) Frampton influence. However many childish fans still upset at this great bands fame cry and moan, it simply doesn't change the always undeniable fact about Tool: they simply keep getting better and better, all members united more structurally and rhythmically than ever before. This is, I might add, bassist Justin Chanellor's shining moment with the band,whom he has been with since AEnima, and his truly exceptional melodic bass playing strays from the typical path followed by his instrument of choice, his sense of melody and unique skill probably being enough to supplement the need for a guitar player in any other band that didn't have Adam Jones on the axe. Jones and Carey truly seem to see eye to eye on this album, guitar stroke matching every single rhythmic blast from Carey's monstrous drum set. <br /> <br />And of course there is Maynard James Keenan, the man himself. He has always been a master lyricist, from the humorous satiric debut of Opiate through the mind-opening pschedelic enlightenment of Lateralus and throughout his second band A Perfect Circle, the influence of which is also undeniable through Keenan's political yet intensely personal lyrics. While I may be wrong in my interpretation, the album seems to follow two vastly end of the spectrum themes, one being the state of humanity and politics in the world, which has always been the target of not only hope, but also machine-gun scrutiny in coming from MJK. The album's opening track and first single, Vicarious takes a well-deserved crack at fast-food fed, TV-droned Americans and their lust for televised violence, while Right In Two openly condemns the state of the Middle East, Keenan comparing humans to \\"monkey killing monkey killing monkey over pieces of the ground.\\" <br /> <br />Of equally powerful, if drastically different, importance is the presence of Keenan's mothers ghost throughout the record, whose time in a wheelchair (the years of which add up to 10,000 days) and eventual death has had a profound effect on the singer, painfully crooning on the title song \\"10,000 days in the fire is long enough...you're going home.\\" The effect is tear-jerking, being the closest this man has ever let his fans get to his soul. This is not the first time his mother has been the subject matter for his songwriting techniques, drawing namesake in the angry Perfect Circle anthem titled Judith, upon which Keenan rebukes her for her faith in a God who has left her \\"broken down and paralyzed.\\" 10,000 Days seems to be the cure and elevated perspective needed for him on this very personal subject. <br /> <br />I am reluctant to go into a song by song analysis for two reasons, one being how cohesively well the songs flow together to make the album as a whole truly a listening experience, while secondly it was just released yesterday and I haven't had quite enough time to let the subtleties of each sink in yet. But the 20 or so listens I have already had have shown me enough to know that my favorite band has failed to let me down again. Many will insult this album, as many ignorant \\"fans\\" do in terms of any good piece of art, but as 311 says \\"F the naysayers 'cause they don't mean a thing.\\" If you have remotely enjoyed anything by this band in the past, 10,000 Days will only serve its purpose in opening your mind to their message that much more. Give it a chance.
B000EULJLU|5.0|It's not Lateralus II, it isn't ?nima II, and in time we will all realize those are good things.  When Tool have made such amazing albums in the past, it's hard for fans to stomach new material.  Give this release some time, it tackles new territory by taking a step back and moving forward at the same time.  I prefer Lateralus, but this album is amazing and a continuation of Lateralus would not have been authentic.
B000EULJLU|5.0|Wow what a package - Although I am later than most to purchase the album after only listening to the album once I am amazed at how accessable these songs are this time round. Usually when I buy a Tool album it would take a good week of solid listening to really get into the sound and figure out what was good about it. However this album including it's insanely beautiful album arts 3D packaging (Stereo Optic Vision) is just what the doctor ordered classic Tool with the same stances as earlier works but new twists on production, you may even hear computer produced drums on Intension. I can say now how Vicarious, 10,00 days, The Pot and Right In Two are currently standout tracks but who knows in a future time it will be set in my head as being the next pinnacle of Tool. Don't judge this like me on just one or two listens (Although I am a hardcore Tool fan) buy the album and keep saturating yourself in it! I feel sorry for reviewer B.Suthers because he won't be able to retract what he has written once he realises just how good this is. So for all you out there minus a copy of this album what are you waiting for don't expect anything different from these guys - expect to be blown away buy the same Tool you have come to love.
B000A6T1JU|3.0|For the best, unadulterated Warriors experience, I'd avoid the Ultimate Director's Cut.  While the commentaries, \\"Where are they now\\" section and other extras are worthy, the comic strip segues now inserted between scenes will jar too heavily with anyone who remembers this film with deserved fondness.  Worse, the pauses they inject tend to trash the movie's rhythym.   <br /> <br />I own both the original and Ultimate Director's Cut, and I'd say if you're a pathetic completist (like I am) then owning both is similarly a no-brainer.  To replace that aging VHS copy of your beloved Warriors, or to enjoy the movie in its pure leather-vested glory, then only the original cut should be considered.
B000E1ZBGS|2.0|This movie was not absolutely horrible, it was alright to watch-if one does not consider it true to the novel Pride and Prejudice.  While the cinematography was beautiful and more artistic than the BBC version (they obviously had a higher budget), the storyline was cut - to below the bare minimum. To some who don't know Pride and Prejudice, it can even be slightly confusing, because nothing is elaborated on. (The music was also too loud on the DVD, and often one would miss what they are saying and must read the captions) Pivotal moments like when Darcy comments on not wanting to dance with Elizabeth seem almost trivial in the presentation of the movie. Sometimes things seem to come out of nowhere- especially when Elizabeth finds out about Lydia, one scene she's happy, the next she walks in and sobs (it was rather funny, though it's not supposed to be).  The storyline between Jane and Bingly was nowhere near as detailed as it should have been, I didn't feel it's importance. It was like the directors considered any storyline not related to Darcy and Elizabeth to be extraneous.  Kiera Knightly does not play a terrible Elizabeth Bennett, though sometimes I found her to say things in a very similar manner to Jennifer Ehle, and other times she would act completely out of character for Elizabeth (though this is probably the screenplay's fault). After Lady Catherine comes near the end, Elizabeth seems completely unreasonable and immature, crying out that she wants to be left alone - this was not how Jane Austen wrote Elizabeth to be.  Mr. Darcy is barely shown, and I didn't really feel like he was as important a character as he was supposed to be. Moments where he's spilling out his heart, the camera is instead focused more often on Elizabeth. Macfadyen didn't really play Darcy to what I imagined him in the book, Firth in the BBC version did a much better job.  There wasn't the best chemistry between Knightly and Macfadyen  and I found myself not really caring that they would end up together in the end.  There are numerous other comments that could be made, but the biggest problem with the adaptation of Pride and Prejudice, was that they over dramatized it. Lady Catherine coming at night, Charlotte Lucas running away saying Elizabeth better not judge her, the proposal in the rain. It all turns Pride and Prejudice into a story that doesn't seem unique- it becomes so cliche. Jane Austen was subtle, and the movie didn't capture that at all.  For those who have not read Jane Austen or seen the BBC version, the movie is not horrible, but to be honest it isn't a classic either.
B000AP2ZDK|5.0|Falling short of being a posthumous release, J. Dilla's instrumental album of various beats and hooks is a fresh record unlike the Ying Yang Twins and Ne-Yo genre that hip-hop has become.<br /><br />With none of the songs lasting past two minutes, it is sometimes difficult to keep track of the thirty-one frantic tracks. Yet, it all blends into one sweet trip. An amazing trip that is incredible difficult to review with all of the over-before-you-know-it songs.<br /><br />He carefully utilizes sampling in \\"Hi\\" and \\"Bye,\\" which becomes its own genre with its progressive neo-soul sound. These faded samplings, however, could become repetitive by \\"Walkinonit,\\" but J Dilla's master of his craft provides otherwise.<br /><br />This album provides the late hip-hop artist with an amazing canvas to spill his various talents on. He slows it down with some crooning in \\"One For Ghost\\" and \\"Don't Cry.\\" With the latter as the longest track on the album, however, it feels drawn out.<br /><br />Like a piece of ginger, \\"Gobstopper\\" refreshes your pallate with its sharp urban jazz stylings before taking you into \\"Thunder,\\" fresh with sirens and screams.<br /><br />For those wanting some nostalgia, \\"Geek Down\\" is a beautiful Jimi Hendrix psychadelic expierence and \\"Anti-American Graffiti\\" fuses the revolutionary sounds of 60's British bands, such as The Beatles with a hip-hop flair. J. Dilla makes Motown his own in \\"Two Can Win\\" and \\"Stop\\", some of the album's stand-outs.<br /><br />There are, however, some irrelevant tracks that are, for the most part, in the middle of the album. \\"One Eleven\\" is a waste of it's one minute and eleven second presence. \\"The Twister\\" takes on more than it can chew. \\"Stepson of the Clapper\\" has zero musical redeemability and it becomes clear that the first half of the album is much stronger than the second. This is confirmed by \\"Time\\" and \\"Waves,\\" which lasts long past its welcome mat.<br /><br />By \\"Lightworks,\\" I am beginning to understand J. Dilla's title, \\"Donuts.\\" Each song takes us through a certain era of music with a hip-hop twist. \\"Lightworks\\" sounds like it is from the soundtrack of \\"Pleasantville... Remixed\\" and \\"Airworks\\" infuses Marvin Gaye's soulful sound with his soulful beats.<br /><br />Another part of J. Dilla's multifaceted work is his use of so many instruments. \\"Mash\\" and \\"The Diff'rence\\" have beautiful uses of the piano, while many other tracks utilize the instruments of jazz. \\"People\\" is saved by its use of the bongo drums, rather than the sirens, which are used too much throughout the album.<br /><br />The shortness of the songs is never a problem until the end of the album with \\"The New\\" and \\"Light My Fire,\\" which were so short it was difficult for me to write anything worthwhile about them.<br /><br />The album finishes strong with \\"Workinonit.\\" This track is the only track that lasts more than two minutes and is an example of the amazing \\"singles\\" work of which J. Dilla is capable.<br /><br />Many of these songs taken individually is a gem. And as revolutionary this album could potentially be to the hip-hop world, the conciseness of the songs is hard to accept in a mainstream hip-hop media that only gives three to four minute songs with either crazy vocals, killer beats or overextended sexual innuendo the time of day. R.I.P: J. Dilla. This grade is no inflated number to sympathize with a late artist. This 32 year-old's music is raw. Passionate. Subtle.

B000ETQRCM|5.0|Let me begin with a small introduction. I'm 19 years of age, and a massive pearljam fan for years. I got into them ages ago, and basically bought most of their back catalogue in the space of a few weeks, with the highlights being ten, vs., vitalogy and yeild. Id never experienced the feeling of wait for a new pearljam arrival so I wasnt sure what to expect.  <br /> <br />Let me tell you, this doesnt disappoint. I see why the lads said they wanted to take their time with this one, its well worth the wait! Its just brilliant, definately back to their best. When I first bought it, I didnt want to overdo it, ya know, pace myself...but i cant put it down! ive literally listened to nothing else this week! <br /> <br />Its just so catchy, full of singalong tracks and catchy riffs. Honestly, the first 8 tracks wouldnt look out of place on ten! Go buy it! and catch them live! <br /> <br />Vedder's love child.
B000EULJLU|5.0|ohh my mother fockin god.this is such a good album, tool has gotten better over there years maybe it had to do with the band hanging out with bands like fantomas and massuggah while maynerd was with APC.Some songs have massuggah feels to them which is dope.I litterally had an orgasm when I heard 10,000 days for the first time I knew they wouldn't dissapoint there fans.And maynerd's vocals and lyrics are so good.And to all those people who say tool sold out and this is there worst yet i say FU you know nothing about music and your a disgrace to mankind and you shouldnt be allowed to live
B000EULJLU|5.0|Yes, this record surpassed my highest expectations.  I listen to it about  or 5 times a day.  The vote is still not in for deciding if this is their best record.  It is the best packaging I've ever seen in a cd.  No other current band has gone to such lengths to unify visual art and music.  Its beautiful.
B0007KTBIU|1.0|I realize historical accuracy was not the intent of the filmmakers here, but as a history teacher, I feel the need to beg you to tell your children that this is not the way Jamestown really went down. An unreal number of students enter high school believing that this film is a historical documentary, and the first step to teaching Jamestown is to convince the students otherwise. <br /> <br />Perhaps good can come from this film, in that it can teach young people to be critical of secondary sources.
B000EULJLU|5.0|After hearing Vicarious I was a bit skeptical of what this album my sound like.  At first listen Vicarious sounded like it belonged on Lateralus and I was disappointed that this was going to be more of the same.  Boy was I wrong!  This album is like nothing Tool has done before.  I am excited and amazed that something this different from Tool can be so good.  10,000 Days (Wings 2) is such a powerfully emotional song.  Maynard really tapped into the loss of his mother for this and the first Wings song.  The lyrics really seem heartfelt.  I loved them instantly.  The rest of the album is also wonderful.  The Pot and Right in Two really stand out.  I was lucky enough to see Tool's show at Coachella last weekend and was actually disappointed they didn't play more new songs.  This album will definitely be in my CD rotation for a long, long time.  Wonderful album!
B000EULJLU|3.0|As a start to this, I purchased OPIATE in 1992 shortly after it had been released so I've been a very big fan of the band for a long time. A lot of the reviews on here seem to be saying it's amazing and sounds like OPIATE which i cannot understand for the life of me. This is a pretty boring record really. Standout tracks for me would be \\"jambi\\",\\"10,000 days\\", \\"rosetta stoned\\", \\"the pot\\"(kind of). <br />The rest is just re-used riffs and rhythms and big fans of tool KNOW THIS! even if they won't admit it. Some of the riffs in \\"Rosetta Stoned\\" are just pinched from Third eye... <br />\\"Vicarious\\" sounds more like an \\"A perfect circle\\" track than a tool number. Still overly long and not interesting though. <br />A lot of the stuff that used to make me feel an adrenaline rush or emotional response doesn't really occur on this album. Danny's drum solo in \\"right in two\\" is predictable, we heard it on 46&2, then on The grudge. Maynard's \\"monkey\\" lyrics on right in two are just downright annoying. I've heard a lot of people saying how they are really \\"deep\\" and \\"insightful\\". I don't see it at all, boring, pretentious lyric writing. <br />All through the album there are moments that give such vivid deja vu to previous albums that it becomes boring, i kept waiting for moments that gave me the shivers like most of the stuff on their previous cds but it didn't really come. <br />\\"10,000 days\\" & \\"jambi\\" are probably the only songs that did that for me. \\"intension\\" & \\"wings for marie\\" are so boring i felt like fast forwarding. The segue tracks, \\"lost keys\\" & \\"lipan conjuring\\" are very frustrating, they don't succeed in creating any mood, they are just confusing. <br />The whole thing feels more like a bunch of songs they came up with that don't link together particularly well. Whereas the cohesive feel on Lateralus and the previous albums is almost sublime.
B00006RIO7|4.0|To be honest, I've never really like the show CHICAGO very much. I find the show too negative, pessimistic, and depressing. Despite this, I will admit that the show boasts some memorable and impressive music numbers and from time to time I find myself humming or singing a tune from the show. The film version of CHICAGO did a wonderful job at bringing the show to the big screen and this album captures much of the musical showmanship on cd. If you like the movie, you will probably enjoy this soundtrack. If you prefer the stage show, you might or might not like this album (I know how particular musical fans can be). Personally, I like some of the songs and there are others that I don't. Out of all the music on the album, track #9, &#34;Mister Cellophane&#34; is my favorite. It has an everyday, average-Joe quality about it that is lacking in most of the other tunes.
1406501557|5.0|Much has been said which needs no repetition, suffice it to say I love this story as I love Lad: A Dog, Rascal & The Black Stallion.  It captures the elegance of the early 20th century as do the first two, & is as warm & loving as all three.<br /><br />That said, why do I post my thoughts?  Besides doing what little I may to improve the rating, I have an especial affinity for this book.  My copy is my grandmothers, a 25th printing from 1915.  Grammy was born not far from Eleanor Porter's home town of Littleton.  In some way they were aquainted & she instilled in grammy a life long love of books, reading & english that was passed to me.  I just wanted to thank them for showing me how to be glad, & I believe you'll be glad too.
B000BISBDY|5.0|Johnny Cash wasn't just a great country musician.  He was a legend of music.  Cash arrived on the music scene around the same time as Elvis Presley and Jerry Lee Lewis.  Rock and Roll was in its infancy and Cash entered into the scene at the right time.  Cash's had a magnificent baritone voice and could play a standard acoustic guitar with the best.  He started off singing folksy rock and roll, but by the end of his life was best known as a country artist.  However, Cash never really fit into any of those genres.  He sung and wrote songs that ran a rampant of musical genres from rock and roll, country, pop, gospel, and folk.  Cash had a style and tune all of his own.  He related best to the common people and his music reflected that.  People loved him for it.  At the same time, musicians knew that Cash was much more than a good ole boy done good.  Musicians know that Cash was a musical genius and his style influenced artists as diverse from U2 to Kris Kristofferson to Nine Inch Nails.  Johnny Cash was a legend and THE LEGEND OF JOHNNY CASH captures that.  Some of Cash's most famous tunes are included on this album, e.g. \\"Folsom Prison Blues\\", \\"Ring of Fire\\", and \\"Man in Black\\".  Also included are songs he sang with wife June Carter (\\"Jackson\\") and songs that illustrate the genius of Cash, \\"Highwayman\\", \\"The Wanderer\\", \\"Rusty Cage\\", and \\"Hurt\\".  There really aren't any terrible Johnny Cash albums, but if a person can only own one album that illustrates the breadth and depth of the musical talents of Cash, THE LEGEND OF JOHNNY CASH is the album to own.
B000ETQRCM|5.0|For those of you who love concise reviews, let's just say that this is easily their best and overall most consistent work since \\"Vs\\"...dare I say, best since \\"Ten\\"?  There, for some of you, that's all you need.  Go buy the album. <br /> <br />Lost?  Not a longtime Pearl Jam fan?  Heard \\"World Wide Suicide\\" on the radio and decided to check them out?  Well, sit down, and prepare to learn what real rock and roll is.  Mindless Clear Channel drones, your savior has arrived. <br />  <br />As for the rest of you, Pearl Jam's eighth studio album, self-titled 15 years into their career, is the culmination of all their ideas and tendencies from \\"Vitalogy\\" to \\"Riot Act\\", forming a diverse and rather urgent album that fans have been waiting for for at least eight years, if not longer.  Don't get me wrong, I love every single one of PJ's albums, but we didn't get \\"Corduroy\\" and \\"Better Man\\" without \\"Bugs\\" and \\"Foxymop\\"; we didn't get \\"In My Tree\\" and \\"Red Mosquito\\" without \\"I'm Open\\"; \\"Given to Fly\\" was a little soured by the presence of \\"Push Me, Pull Me\\"; \\"Binaural\\" was just incredibly uneven, and \\"Riot Act\\", while having some real gems, was littered with filler like \\"Help Help\\" and \\"Arc\\". <br /> <br />So now Pearl Jam, with a new label, puts out a new album, and what do we get?  NO FILLER!  Experimentation is kept to a minimum, and for the first time since 1993's \\"Vs.\\", we get an album that is consistently good from start to finish.  No seven-minute musical abortions like \\"Foxymop\\" tacked on the end of the album to drag it down.  Even the one-minute \\"Wasted Reprise\\" is poignant and has nothing in common to previous crap-shorts like \\"Pry, To\\". <br /> <br />Some people, for some reason, seem to think that just because this album, heralded by many of the band members as their best work to date, is not in the same vein as \\"Ten\\", it's not a good album.  Sure, expectations were really high for this album, but let's face it, nothing can touch \\"Ten\\", and that was 15 years ago.  Let's all learn to let go of \\"Ten\\" and embrace a new, just-about-as-good era of Pearl Jam. <br /> <br />The first five songs are an all-out musical assault that is a powerful affirmation to disheartened fans that Pearl Jam, and REAL ROCK MUSIC in general, is alive and well.  \\"Life Wasted\\" (9.5/10) is a powerful, guitar-driven opener that I can see getting a lot of popular play at concerts.  \\"World Wide Suicide\\" (9.5/10) is the one we've all heard already, and it's not even the best song on the album, though it's the best choice for a single from Pearl Jam since at least Given to Fly.  \\"Comatose\\" (9/10) is strikingly similar to \\"Spin the Black Circle\\", only five times better.  Fast and furious, and Eddie sounds straight out of Vitalogy.  \\"Severed Hand\\" (9/10) has a really cool opener, and while I'm not too keen on some of the vocals (too weak - sounds at times like \\"Riot Act\\"-era Eddie), it's a solid, rocking tune with a good ending.  \\"Marker in the Sand\\" (9.5/10) is one of the strongest tracks on the album, alternating between heavy, powerful verses and a beautiful, melodic, radio-friendly chorus that sounds like it would fit well on Yield.  \\"Parachutes\\" (9.5/10) is a soft, Beatles-esque acoustic ballad that brings the listener down slowly after the first five tracks, with some great singing by Eddie.  \\"Unemployable\\" (9.5/10) has some great drumming from Matt and a catchy chorus, though the verses are a little annoying.  \\"Big Wave\\" (9.5/10) is an exciting, fast-paced track with an awesome chorus, though I'm not too keen on the surfer theme.  \\"Gone\\" (9.5/10), a song about driving, bears a resemblance to \\"In Hiding\\" with its soft verses and euphoric chorus.  \\"Wasted Reprise\\" (8.5/10), a slower rendition of the chorus of \\"Life Wasted\\" to an organ, is the weakest track on the album, though even at a minute, it's still not skip-worthy.  \\"Army Reserve\\" (9/10) (in my opinion) has stylistic similarities to Riot Act, though it would have been one of the best songs on that album,with interesting time changes and a powerful chorus that rocks to solid drumming.  \\"Come Back\\" (9.5/10) took a long time for me to really get into, but now I love it.  A beautiful ballad, with some of the best singing from Eddie since at least Vitalogy, that is destined to become a concert staple, and if it weren't for purists, it has the potential to overtake \\"Yellow Ledbetter\\" as a concert-ender.  The album closes out with the best track, \\"Inside Job\\" (10/10), with some somewhat iffy lyrics by McCready.  Still, laced with beautiful piano and heartfelt singing from Eddie, it has a few prog rock elements that liken it to Pink Floyd, and its progression from a soft ballad to a rocker reminds me a bit of \\"Hard to Imagine\\" from Lost Dogs. <br /> <br />A strong vocal performance from Eddie that would make you think he has jumped back ten years, the perfect collaboration of all the bandmates, and some of the best songwriting in years all come together to form the masterwork of their later years.  Forget \\"Yield.\\"  Heck, forget \\"Vitalogy\\" and \\"Vs.\\".  \\"Avocado\\" is the new king of the mountain. <br /> <br />Besides, what else are we going to listen to?  My Chemical Romance?  I rest my case. <br /> <br />5 Stars. <br /> <br />(And for those of you who don't know, the avocado is the symbol of the Green Party, to which Eddie belongs.) <br />
B000ETQRCM|5.0|While I have enjoyed Pearl Jam's music from the beginning, I have been somewhat disappointed with the overly experimental albums they have insisted on producing from Vitalogy onwards.  This self titled gem signals a definite return to form.  I have waited years for Pearl Jam to wake up and start rocking like they did in the beginning.   <br /> <br />This album is not to be missed!!!
0060736267|5.0|A Tree Grows in Brooklyn, written by Betty Smith, is a fabulous novel, which is about a young girl growing up poor in Williamsburg, Brooklyn with her family and neighbors.  This novel was published in 1943 by Harper and Brothers Publishing and was selected as one of the Books of the Century by the New York Public Library.  Francie Nolan, the protagonist of this story, is a delightful young child with such great determination to succeed and to get an education.  This novel is so interesting, because it shows how the hardship of daily life was like back in the 1900s.  Francie Nolan has a very tough time growing up in Brooklyn at age 11.  Part of this reason is because her father is an alcoholic, who struggles tremendously, therefore not being able to be a good father.  This comes down to Francie having an empty stomach continuously.  Francie is such a gentle and obedient young girl who is a mix of both the Nolan family and the Rommely family, though she is more of her own person.  She acquires her own personality and own traits through her observations and readings, which really makes Francie a live and brilliant character. <br />    A Tree Grows in Brooklyn was written very methodically, with the chapters going through Francie's life year by year, consisting with times when you can just about break out into tears, and times when you are just angry with a specific character.  The conflicts, in which take place in Francie Nolan's life, are so realistic and entertaining that any reader will fall in love with the protagonist, Francie Nolan.   <br />    Betty definitely achieved her purpose in writing this novel, for she intended for readers both young and mature to realize how fortunate they are to have up to three meals a day, while Francie considered it a blessing to eat only a slice of stale bread.    A Tree Grows in Brooklyn strongly emphasizes the value of reading and education very clearly, but more significant, the importance of family and friends who will doanything to keep you safe from the real world.       <br />
B000EULJLU|5.0|A good comeback after 5 years; however it takes several listening cycles to really absorb 10,000 days and appreciate the musical art behind it. The stereoscopic lenses provided an extra bonus that as far as I can remember it's the first time I have seen it in an album case; hence quite original. Overall, I rate the album 5 stars because it is still Tool, maybe not at its best but Tool nonetheless. I recommend it.
B000007T1M|5.0|This is one of the most creative and motivated group of musicians i've seen in a long time.  Where to begin? First off i'd say that words like \\"Mad Scientist\\" or maybe \\"Sonic Wizard\\" come to mind when describing Serj Tankian [vocals] when it comes to writing lyrics, and apparently trained fluently in opera.  He wrote and sings almost all the lyrics on this album, which i prefer.  Even though i think Daron Malakian [guitar & vocals] does great backup vocals, haha.  Oh, I mean the hilariously obnoxious blood curdeling screams that can be heard from time to time, which is something i miss from there latest releases.  John Dolmayan [drums] holds down a great rythme section while Shavo Odadjian [bass] keeps it simple.  You can also occasionally hear Middle Eastern influences throughout the record, you hear this more often on later albums.  Anyway, there is an ENORMOUS amount of memorable content on this record.  Every song on this record is a keeper and i'd strongly advise this album for anyone who likes alternative metal or progressive rock.  On a side note, Rick Rubin is probably my favorite producer.
6305736650|5.0|This is as many Amazon reviewers have already said one of the most popular, if not the most popular and beloved movie of all time. I first saw the movie many years ago when I knew about its legend, and as with many other movies I did not 'get it' all at first shot. Still there was something about it, a feeling, a certain aura which made it memorable.<br /><br />No doubt a central part of this is Bogart, the reluctant patriot, the American exile tough - guy who does the right thing in the end. The famous \\"Play it Again Sam\\" his pain and restraint in his love for the Bergmann character are a convincing version of the old Western hero in his silence. The stunningly beautiful Bergman does not have to much but just whisper a few words. They will ' always have Paris'. The minor players Claude Rains, Peter Lorre , and the 'As Time Goes by \\" pianist seem just right.<br /><br />This movie made in the midst of the Second World War wins our hearts also because it a patriotic one. The great scene in which Rains contadicts the boisterous Nazis, and orders the singing of the 'Marsellaise ' is in itself a classic.<br /><br />And of course that final scene the flying away of Bergman and Henreid, while Bogey is left with his French police - officer friend , who orders the 'rounding up of the usual suspects' rescues the Bogart- Bergman farewell from bathos, and makes for a strangely upbeat ending.<br /><br />A great film- one of the greatest.
B000E6UWE4|1.0|I was recommended this book by someone whose opinion I trust, and a new fantasy author always piques my interest. However, over 200 pages in, and I can safely say that my interest is now de-piqued.<br /><br />While Erikson has some considerable ability with world-building - and his city heated / illuminated by gas is wonderfully visual - I should have known better when I saw his 3-4 page list of Dramatis Personae. I should have known better when the plot showed no apparent central thrust after page 100, and instead of a solid spine to hook onto, I was left with myriad mini-plots revolving around conspiracy, magic, political convolutions, murder, more magic, prophecy, more magic . . .<br /><br />It became increasingly difficult to get past the calculations necessary to figure out who was allied with who in order to gain any sympathy for the characters. I sorta can see Tattersail as central, but the pov switches too often for me to get behind her as a main protag. Then there's Paran, who gets murdered and conveniently brought back to life, and Whiskeyjack and his Bridgeburners, who show real promise, but they aren't on stage often enough for me to ally myself with them. In fact, NO-ONE remains onstage for very long. I was just getting used to Sail and co when Kruppe and his merry men show up, and I seriously considered ditching the book right then and there.<br /><br />Neither does the plot show anything resembling a central story. I've no idea what any of the main characters want, except Laseen, who just wants power. Why should I be interested in a story which apparently has no stakes? Characters appear and die, and so what?<br /><br />Sorry, Mr Erikson. I had high hopes for this novel. I won't buy the second.
0307277674|1.0|An entertaining whodunnit with a religious twist written at a 7th grade level which offers mass public appeal. What incites me to write a review is how ridiculous Dan Brown has been on television hyping up his book by saying he was a \\"skeptic\\" until \\"extensively researching\\" where he has now become a believer in his work.<br /><br />Brown provides a preliminary page of \\"facts\\" that are used to back up his fiction. That the \\"facts\\" are wrong and widely denounced as poorly researched reflects poorly on Brown as an author. Many have suggested his interest and motivation lie in his own agenda, but I would argue that he is playing on the uneducated masses to really debate such a \\"controversial\\" issue with what is purely speculative fiction to line his pockets.<br /><br />Better actor than author...<br /><br />My interest in this subject matter and analytical side in search of concrete data surrounding this matter (that Dan Brown disappointed me with, especially with a weak ending) I did find in a related new book out--<br /><br />Breaking The Da Vinci Code  by Darrell L. Bock, Ph.D.
B000A59PMO|5.0|This show contains incredible wit, humor, intelligence, emotion, intrigue, and romance that you can't help but be obsessed. You will find amazing character development, fascinating season mysteries, and extremely talented actors and writers. <br /> <br />(SPOILERS for the first episode only:) We find out that Veronica Mars's best friend, Lilly, was murdered, her boyfried mysteriously dumped her beforehand, her mother skipped town, her father, the sheriff, was kicked out of office for accusing Lilly's father of the murder, and Veronica was raped. The first season deals with these life-altering changes, as well as individual episode mysteries. If this sounds at all interesting, you should check out the show. <br /> <br />If nothing else, each of my seven friends that I introduced to my DVDs became obsessed (which includes many episode marathons, the longest on record being a twelve hour marathon going from 11 at night to 11 in the morning because he couldn't stop and wanted to know what happened).  <br /> <br />It has never failed to fascinate and endear itself to anyone I know.  Plus, Logan is gorgeous!
B000EULJLU|5.0|WOW!! Hardcore Tool, look out.  With tunes like The Pot, the Tool I know and love is back.  Some weird stuff, but when you let it skate, the length of the songs aren't noticed.  10,000 days part 2 is very reminisent of the swing feel of oldies like Faries Wear Boots.  Deffinately the best album of 2006 so far.  Keep em coming you duutty buggers
B000EULJLU|4.0|I must say, tool has put together some very likeable songs on this album that were worth the wait. The package alone with the Steroglasses and 3-D artwork is enough to buy this album to place on a shelf as an interesting conversation piece.   \\"The Pot\\" I think is the best song on the album, reminiscent of old Opiate days, and Vicarious and Jambi are both refreshing after the two slow driviling DVD singles that tool released.  It is hard to notice that all three of these tracks are 5-7 minutes long.  On the other hand, I could not wait to get through songs like wings for marie and 10000 days, which is what it took to listen to the two tracks.  A lot of filler.  Rosetta Stoned is about the best lengthy song on this album because it doesn't stall in the middle and keeps changing pace enough to keep yourself mind awake.  Tool needs to stop trying to do trance like stuff, because the stuff isn't relaxing, just painful to get through.  <br />Also, the drum machine/casio keyboard at the end of intension was not cool.   <br />    Overall though, the positives outweigh the negatives, and this album was well worth the wait.
B000002MQ9|5.0|Talk about serendipity. I was surfing for a track called \\"I Wanna Watch Cartoons\\" by Happy Flowers when I ran across a link to DCD. This is some of the most stunning and sublimely evocative music I've ever heard. If there is any music in you it will go straight to the core of your being. Favorites so far are Sanvean, Persephone, Summoning of the Muse and The Host of Seraphim. As you can see I lean towards Lisa Gerrard. (Now I know why I liked the Gladiator soundtrack so much.) She has a voice that can recall ancient sunsets or evoke vast sonic landscapes. Some of the pieces are not immediately accessible, but repeated listening draws you deeper and deeper into the music. This I consider the hallmark of quality music.  I'm not very knowledgeable about the Goths but some recommended reading to accompany the music would be \\"The Dying Earth\\" (Jack Vance), \\"The House on the Borderland\\" (William Hope Hodgson) or even \\"The Night Land\\", by the same author. In combination, the music and literature should take you to a very different place. Just don't forget to come back - it could be very hard to leave.
B000B5IOUW|4.0|The basic idea of \\"The Butterfly Effect\\" appeals to me. I remember the Ray Bradbury short story where the guy goes back in time to shoot a T-Rex and changes the future because he comes back with a butterfly on his boot and enjoyed watching Sam trying to set the past to rights on \\"Quantum Leap.\\" But the story from co-writers and co-directors Eric Bress and J. Mackye Gruber also resonates with me because of an idea I had for short story about a rich guy who wants the Confederacy to win the Civil War. He sits in the time machine trying to select the right moment to go back and change history; he only has one shot and he sits there, going over all the options (e.g., assassinate Lincoln years earlier, help Pickett's charge succeed), unable to decide which would guarantee success.<br /><br />However, in \\"The Butterfly Effect\\" it turns out that Evan (Ashton Kutcher) has multiple opportunities for changing his past, although actally it is the past of Kayleigh Miller (Amy Smart) that he wants to change. But his also means changing the past of Kayleigh's brother, Tommy (William Lee Scott) and their friend, Lenny (Elden Henson), as well as Evan's mother (Melora Walters) and his college roommate (Ethan Suplee). The problem is that every time he changes the past things do not necessarily get better as new problems are presented. But Evan keeps trying to find the magic solution that will set everything to rights, or at least what he thinks would be the best of all possible worlds.<br /><br />Evan and his friends had a trouble childhood. \\"The Butterfly Effect\\" takes place mainly in the present, but it also involves going back to when the kids were 7 and discovered that Mr. Miller (Eric Stolz) was a sicko and when they were 13 and something equally horrible happened. The first time we visit these events we do not know everything that happened because Evan does not remember; as a child he was afflicted with blackouts and since the film is told from his perspective we follow suit. Evan's mother is worried that he might have the same mental illness as his father, but Dr. Redfield (Nathaniel DeVaux) does not think so and has Evan start keeping a journal.<br /><br />In college Evan discovers that when he reads the journal entries he wrote in the past he can go back to that moment in time and that he can control what he says and does, thereby changing the present. This is certainly an interesting way of engaging in time travel (cf. Christopher Reeves thinks his way to the past in \\"Somewhere in Time\\") and I think \\"The Butterfly Effect\\" is a rather ambitious time travel film that is trying to be intelligent in terms of both the theory at work and the construction of the story. This is one of those films where you can better appreciate it the second time around, even if you do all the Infinifilm options, especially once you understand the rules for the game.<br /><br />In the end I am not sure if it is because the intelligence of the story by Bress and Gruber is not up to their ambition, but you cannot fault the effort. One of the strengths of this film is how it takes it time, as Evan wrestles with not only the changes in his world but struggles to figure out what he can do to make everything better the next time around. This is certainly superior to their previous effort, \\"Final Destination 2\\" and it will be interesting to see what they come up with next if they continue along this path. As for performances I would say that Amy Smart's is the best of the bunch and as for Ashton Kutcher, I know he is usually regarded as a tabloid joke or a television pretty boy, but this was actually the first film I have seen when I liked his character or his performance. He might be a forgotten actor by the end of the decade, but he gets props for showing some ambition. But in the final analysis this is Bress and Gruber's film and everybody is just along for the ride.<br /><br />I watched the director's cut (or, I guess, the directors' cut) before seeing the original theatrical ending or the two alternative endings (\\"Stalker\\" and \\"Happy Sappy\\") and at this point would have to say the first one I saw is the best of the bunch. That is because while the effect remains the same the cause in the original theatrical release is just too simplistic after the complicated setup. Granted, the preferred version is rather dark and twisted, but if you listen to any of the commentary on the DVD you will understand their reasoning.g the original theatrical ending or the two alternative endings (\\"Stalker\\" and \\"Happy Sappy\\") and at this point would have to say the first one I saw is the best of the bunch.

0375831002|5.0|I've read a lot of fiction in all age ranges, but I have not come across many that I could call \\"core shakers.\\" The Book Thief definitely surpassed all expectations and has received that label. It was a moving, powerful, and remarkably well-written story that I could not put down. I almost didn't read it because the topic (a family during World War II) and the narrator (Death) were so overwhelmingly depressing, but I am so glad I picked it up and gave it a try. I felt such an incredible emotional connection to the characters in the story...it's nice to know there are still writers out there that can bring you to that place. I would rank it in my top 5 favorite books of all time. I highly recommend it!
B000EULJLU|3.0|I love tool...I really do. And there are some great tracks on this album...but. <br /> <br />They have run out of ideas and made an album with alot of \\"filler\\" yes I know what you say...Music without lyrics is not filler.  <br /> <br />Its just that I expect more from a band in this calliber. Ive seen them live and own all their work. Comparing this album to typical rock radio I would give it 4 stars. Comparing this work when put along with their previous efforts I have to give it three. Cohesiveness lacks. The album seems lost at times. Hopefully I just need more time with it. <br /> <br />I bought both the new PJ and Tool...I think I will go back to the new PJ.
0920668364|5.0|My Godmother gave me this book in its original German version for the birth of my son. It really touched my heart. I always get choked up reading it... <br />In the original/ German version by the way, the mother does NOT go across town to her grown son's house and climbs through his window. She instead is in bed at home, reminiscing about the times when he was a baby and sings the song to herself, NOT her grown son. Weird English translation error for that one....
B000ETQRCM|5.0|People say Pearl Jam is back.  People say that the new album is the best since Vitalogy and reminiscent of Ten.  The truth is that Pearl Jam never left; the core of their music can be discovered on all of their albums if a listener searches hard enough.  While Riot Act and Binaural might not have the beginning-to-end smash hits like Ten, songs like \\"Light Years\\" and \\"Cropduster\\" rank right up there with PJ's best.  The heart of their music lies in the message delivered by the soul-pounding lyrics and the spine-tingling music that accompanies it.   <br /> <br />And with the new album, nothing has changed.  Some reviews say that they released the proper single with \\"World Wide Suicide,\\" which I agree with in terms of mass societal appeal.  But tracks like \\"Unemployed,\\" \\"Life Wasted,\\" and \\"Marker in the Sand\\" are better.   <br /> <br />Of course, writing this review is pointless.  What makes Pearl Jam the best band in the world is that they don't give a shhh about critics.  As long as they keep pumping out stuff that defies convention and the idiotic critics, I'm happy.  So, for those of you who haven't liked anything since Vitalogy, go back and listen to songs like \\"In Hiding,\\" \\"In My Tree,\\" \\"Red Mosquito,\\" Sleight of Hand,\\" \\"Love Boat Captain,\\" \\"MFC,\\" and the two songs mentioned earlier, then tell me that Pearl Jam \\"is back.\\" The truth is they never left. <br />
B000EULJLU|5.0|Alright. I know what you're thinking after the first listen. Where's the hate? Where's the patented Maynard scream? Why are the songs so long? What is going on here?    I'll admit I asked those same questions after the first listen. The build up to this release was intense, and probably got out of control. I heard people saying the upcoming Tool release was going to be the band at its heaviest, that they had been listening to Opeth and Meshuggah, and to expect a merge of those Swedish supergroups. But if you've been listening to Tool as long as I have, you know the band likes to surprise people, it likes to throw curve balls, it doesn't release an album until they believe it is finished, and it produces albums that cannot be figured out with just one listen.    To start, Vicarious, Jambi, The Pot, and Rosetta Stoned are absolute rockers. Yes, maybe a bit too much APC influence on the first track, but did Maynard's other band ever have such blasting riffs, and earthquake-inducing drum beats? All of these heavier songs employ odd time signatures, ones that even for me (a former drummer) are hard to keep up with. And the bass...Justin Chancellor explodes in a number of these tracks. I can't remember really noticing his work as much, on any other Tool album (he did not appear on Opiate or Undertow).    Then there are the typical Tool interim tracks: Lipan Conjuring, Lost Keys (Blame Hofmann), and Viginti Tres. They set the mood, they aren't going to blast a hole in your pants...they are what they are. Were you expecting any past tracks such as these to set the world ablaze (like Intermission, Mantra, Cesaro Summability, Disgustipated)???    And finally, the tracks that seem to be causing the most controversy: Wings for Marie Parts I and II, Intension, and Right In Two. They are all very long. On the first listen, I did find myself anticipating some type of bone-crushing guitar line to pop out of nowhere, and then suddenly, the song was over. GET OVER IT. That is not what this Tool album is about. Once I freed myself of this anticipation, I listened to the album again. And again. And again. In the middle of the second listen, my appreciation grew. By the fourth, I found this to be the third best Tool album ever released - which makes 10,000 Days close to being the third best album ever released. (Aenema and Lateralus are one and two in that order.)    Close followers, and those who understand what Tool means, know that the band is an experience. You don't figure them out right away. They are deceptive. They want you to \\"think for yourself, question authority,\\" to consider other possibilities, to abandon your prejudices. Therefore, your first listen of 10,000 Days will not give you the full story. Maynard's voice is in full form (and you'll find he uses new tonations and distortions this time around), Adam's guitar work cannot be duplicated by any other band (when you hear him, you know it's Adam, sort of like Piggy (RIP) of Voivod, Alex Lifeson of Rush, and even Tommy Victor of Prong). We've already mentioned Justin, and as for Danny...is anyone with a knowledge of percussion out there not floored by how every swipe of his two arms is heard, and felt? His sticks could reverse the blood flow in your arteries.    You were expecting Lateralus 2? You didn't get it. Aenima 2? Undertow 2? Opiate 2? Just think: each of those albums was different in their own right. Tool is a progression. 10,000 Days is the Tool of today. Maynard doesn't hate anymore (at least not as much). There are no Hookers with Penises, there are no Jerk-Offs that need to be shot in the f**** head... The major clue here is Maynard's dedicating the album's title and two tracks to his late mother. (You already know this, right? A stroke paralyzed her, and she died...drum roll...roughly 27 years, or roughly 10,000 days later.)    By the way, Tool probably goes to greater lengths to preserve their music, and keep it out of the hands of free-wheeling downloaders, than anyone else. Buy the CD. If not because the band is owed for its work, purchase 10,000 Days because of the fabulous artwork, and stereo-scopic lenses in the package.    It may be years before everyone fully appreciates this release. I guess that's what happens, when you're a band that is so far ahead of everyone else.
0553582445|4.0|I picked this book up due to the blurb from George RR Martin on the cover.  I wasn't dissapointed.  It started off kind of slow and I was a bit confused due to not having read the other books that deal with Fitz. But it did get better and had me hooked.  I'm still pretty new to this Fanasty genre, but I'm beginning to like it.   <br /> <br />I really like the connection people can have with animals, although at first I was confused about the differences between \\"Wit\\" and \\"skill.\\"   <br /> <br />I don't like to give story or plot away in reviews so I will just say that this was a good book and I'm almost done with the second one which I like even better.  These books are worth the read.
B000062YAZ|5.0|Riveting. Absolutely stunning in all musical standards. Slayers Reign in Blood is THE essential thrash album. The speed of all the instruments is unmatched and the lyrics are just plain intense. The ferocity of this album is incredible and every song is played at 10000 miles an hour. Aggression is the keg ingredient to any great metal album and this record has it in spades. A triumph on all fronts in the thrash genre.
B000000W5L|5.0|Listen not every song on this album is amazing the stones have never made an album with 18 songs before this and never did after there is a 14 song amazing album in this the others (shake your hips sweet black angel turd on the run stop breaking down)could have been ommited easy. That being said this is still a amazing album well worth it some of the best songs on here by the stones.If your new to the stones just say no go for stickey fingers or let it bleed even beagers banquet before this but get this after.Finally please skip some girls it's over rated.
B000002H2H|5.0|Superior to Master of Puppets in some aspects this is simpley one of the greatest if not THE greatest metal album of all time. Superb lyrics. Electrifying instramentals. Sharp production. Huge influence on my life. Connects with the anger and confusion of youth in ways few albums can. You will not regret in any way purchasing this flawless recording.
B000EMGAGW|1.0|definitely the worst album of 2006. where is the old mobb deep? its more like a g-unit cd with g-unit featuring on about half the tracks in this album...dissapointing. stay away from this. all the ppl who say that this is what gangsta rap is about can go to hell. <br />dissapointed. never ever am i going to buy a mobb deep cd
B000ETQRCM|3.0|I've got my copy today from Amazon (delivered sooner than scheduled, thanks guys)  and I feel a bit dissappointed..and worried. Our most cherished band's latest release is now-let's face it-mainstream. Pearl Jam has always meant innovation in its own right. Where did the flair go? Though last 3 tracks shine, which seem most musically coherent and true to Pearl Jam sound.  <br /> <br />I cannot compare...I cannot compare...
B000E6GBV2|1.0|This is the first time I have ever been compelled to write a review.  Everyone who wrote a review below may want to check their house for an open can of paint thinner because I think they're musical opinion is a bit clouded.  This album is a BLATANT rip-off of My Morning Jacket, and a shoddy rip-off at that.   Not a decently written song on the album.  Shame on you Band of Horses.  Get your own style.
B000A176VU|3.0|I recently read Night Over Water and Pillars in the Earth and was taken by the lush ease into which Follett pulls his readers into his stories. So when I picked up Eye of the Needle, I was both kind of hoping it would be as good as the two previously mentioned books while at the same time feeling that no way could it live up to the high standards I was now placing Follett fare.<br /><br />Sadly, Eye of the Needle is a bit of a mess in my opinion. From the get go it jumps around from one scene to the next with little in the way of transition. So though time is going by quickly at times, it is a little startling to find out several pages into a chapter that months have transpired when you think what you are reading is taking place only hours later. This is a very short book in comparison to Night over Water and a short story in comparison to Pillars in the Earth. And I think that it suffers a little because in all honesty, this might be the most complicated of the three stories. I wish that Follett had been a little more comfortable and taken his time fleshing out events, plots,and places.<br /><br />This book is not a total disaster. You will come up against a myriad of familiar Follettisms. The characters area formed much like they are in other books so it will feel almost like you know them. Lusty scenes pop up every fifty pages like clockwork, and the writing is vintage Follett. If you love his books, this is not one to shy away from. But if this might be your first Follett experience, I would say \\"look for Pillars in the Earth instead. I guarantee you a better, more satisfying page turner.\\"
B000ETQRCM|5.0|This album is simply one of the best I've purchased in quite some time.  In this day and age of cupcake \\"rock\\" and emo crap, it's refreshing for the vintage sound of TRUE rock to come back.  I've been a PJ fan since the beginning, and it's nice to see they still have the angst of old, although a matured and focused angst.  The entire album is good, but Comatose is the song that really got me rolling with this.  I'm a mellow person in general, but even my wife noticed a difference in my energy level after hearing it.  I have a feeling the arenas will ERUPT when this song is played live, but they'll be rocking anyway because....well...it's PEARL JAM. <br /> <br />I highly recommend this album, because it brings a taste of many different flavors to the table.  One thing I've noticed that this album has, as opposed to the others, is more variety.  Most people will give you similar patterns as to songs they liked on previous albums, but this one is all over the board.  Everyone finds something they like on it, and that's the sign of a beautiful piece of work. <br /> <br />Get it, or you'll regret it.
B000EMGAGW|5.0|when i first heard mobb deep went to g-unit, i got pissed. i thought it was over. then i read all of prodigys' interviews, saw the g-unit tattoo and said to myself, \\"hiphop just took another loss\\". i decided that i wasn't buying BLOOD MONEY. i looked at ghostface killah to save NY. BIG DISSAPPOINTMENT!! ALL OF SUDDEN I WAS LOOKING FORWARD TO MOBB DEEP. i bought blood money, listened, and said, \\"mobb is still the mobb\\".  THE 1ST 5 TRACKS ARE BETTER THAN THE ENTIRE FISCALE CD. the only song i can do without is BACKSTAGE PASS. i can also do without lloyd banks on STOLE SOMETHIN'. he is overrated and his voice is irritating. there is no fire in his delivery. yayo is wack but the beat on CLICK CLICK is so hard that it makes him nice. the beat serves as that drill sergent coach yelling at his weakest player in practice. 50 came off but on CREEP, but i as well as a few others think havok wrote the verse. i read a few reviews and someone here said, \\"not enough\\" songs. my answer to that is, buy fishscale. you get 24 tracks on fishcale, of those, 7 are skits which leaves you with 17 songs. of those 17, about 4 tracks listed as songs, are like a minute and change. now you are left with 13 songs. of those, 8 are WACK. YOU ARE LEFT WITH 5 GOOD SONGS ON FISHSCALE. on blood money, there are no skits, JUST MUSIC. i do miss big noyd on this album. he is perfect with them.   this album is a Mobb DEEP, NY album. IT'S WORTH THE MONEY.
B0002Z0EYK|1.0|Ahhhh....the anticipation of enjoying another epic movie. Only to be disappointed. Why, oh why, do they have to change the storyline?? Why not let Menelaus live and have Paris killed instead?? In the actual legend, it's more like reality check, not just black and white (good lives, evil dies). Puuuuhhhlease!!    Been reading every version of this story, and consistency is the name of the game. Until this horrible movie came out. Now, history and literature will never be the same.    This movie is nothing but a vehicle for Brad Pitt and Orlando Bloom. Brad's acting sucks, about as bad as Tom Cruise's (ever noticed the so-called cute lil' actors can't act at all)?? And Orlando's character should've been eliminated 'bout halfway down the movie. Bad, bad script.      There are two outstanding actors who performed so well. Eric Bana's Hector as the loyal but conflicted big brother and responsible son is so convincing you can't help but feel sorry for him after he was killed by a terrible actor....er...warrior.  And Brian Cox is always excellent in any role he portrays. Now wonder he was awfully pissed when they (the dumbass writers) killed his brother, Menelaus (Gleeson, who should've broken Bloom's wimpy back for good).    No, this movie could've been better if only the central characters didn't revolve around Pitt and Bloom. And for that, I don't even want to add this movie in my DVD collection. Don't even give me that DVD as a gift. No, thank you.
B000002I25|5.0|And believe me, that wasn't a tough conclusion to jump to. This record is unbelievable. Throw away your Nickelback and Linkin Park bullcrap and prepare to be treated to an unforgettable listening experience.
B000EULJLU|4.0|This is another great album by Tool. It has a dark atmosphere, longish songs, many odd metered riffs, cool drumming, and moody interludes between \\"songs\\". I can't believe that so many Tool fans are having trouble enjoying this album. It is a Tool album in every sense. It has all the characteristics that every Tool fan has raved about for the past 15 years. I think that if fans try to listen to it with fresh ears, as they have for earlier releases, most will find that this new music will move them like before. I think the tracks Vicarious and The Pot are epic rock songs where the whole band hits the elusive sweet spot. Check out a different great band such as Dream Theater if this style of music has become too mundane for you.
B00005JNRY|4.0|A little known secret about Pixar, is their huge support for their local community.  Last night I attended a fund raiser premier of CARS at Pixar's studio's in Emeryville CA.  The event raised over $80,000 for our local school district!    So here are my thoughts on the movie.    Firstly, this is a fast paced and LOUD movie.  Those with sensitive ears should think about taking cotton buds to the theater.    Ok, I read some of the comments so far based on the teaser's and have to say that the animated cars are done wonderfully.  Each car really has it's own personality and although they do look a little cartoonish, Pixar has again shown that they can animate anything and bring it to life and then some.    The big race scenes are really only at the very beginning and at the very end, the majority of the movie is set in a small town \\"Radiator Springs\\" somewhere in the midwest just off Route 66.      I won't give too much away as far as the story goes, you'll need to go see it yourself for that.    The movie is packed full of very funny jokes and scenes, like the Tractor Tipping scene, and the SUV off-road bootcamp!    Visually, this movie is stunning.  I can't imagine the amount of research that went into producing this one.  Anyone who has driven I-40 near Amarillo TX will recognise the mountain ranges shaped like old Cadillac's burried nose down in the sand.  They really capture the road trip experience.  And the scenery is breath-taking.    Not being a big fan of \\"Larry The Cable Guy\\" I have to say that his performance as Mater the tow truck, was brilliant.  As one of the main characters, he was very funny and endearing.    Technically, Pixar really pushed the envelope again.  We're used to Pixar movies breaking ground in each movie, the underwater rendering in Finding Nemo, the fur rendering in Monsters Inc., etc.. In cars, it's all about the rendering of dust particles which looks super realistic and is not an easy thing to achieve.      Overall, this movie will have great appeal to a lot of people, although I personally think that The Incredibles is still my favorite.  This one might not win the Best Animated Feature award but I'm sure it will get awards for the technical aspects of the film.    Finally, I just want to thank Pixar once again for their amazing and continued support to the local community, whether it be fund raising events like last nights, or the masses of computers they donate to the schools, or the number of their employee's that regularly volunteer their freetime to work with the kids in mentoring programs.  I couldn't wish for a better neighbor.
B00006JKOL|4.0|I like this cd because include songs that in my opinion are so good has those present in the great albums Aqualung and Thick as a Brick.
B000EULJLU|5.0|With 10,000 Days, it seems Tool has completed the transition from grinding angst that they began with Lateralus (an album that I never truly got into for this exact reason). Not every fan will tolerate the toned-down atmosphere or the \\"borrowed\\" elements from AEnima and even A Perfect Circle's Mer De Noms, but the album still stands as a great achievement in its own right.
B00000IN5G|5.0|when i first heard children of bodom i have to admit i really didnt like them but perhaps i was in my whole nu metal phase but after a while listening to slipknot got boring and it starting bland i mean wheres first (solos) ? but something is missing. Then i got into metalcore for like a month them i found a odd band from Finland COB !! they are great combing heavyness with melody yet not sounding like retards while doing so also the keyboards add a nice touch to the overall music BUt i am trying to say i got into real metal because of these Finnish guys!!! Best ablum of theirs the best songs Warheart Silent night bodom night bed of razors downfall and Children of bodom alright         Emo SUCKS
B000BEZQ0Y|4.0|This beautiful score is brilliantly played by pianist Jean-Yves Thibaudet. The full score is composed by Dario Marianelli. It really enhances the movie - wich I think is very wonderful - and do not sufocate the story.    Very similar to the also great score 'Finding Neverland' by Jan A.P. Kaczmarek. And I think - maybe - Dario had found a good inspiration on the opus 1983 album 'From Gardens Where We Feel Secure' by Virginia Astley (and Arvo Part's 'Alina'). When I listen to this score (and Virginia's album) I can see the English countryside full of flowers, farm animals and birds singing. And I think it is really a compliment for a lovely and great score wich evokes naturally old rural England.
B000EGCITG|4.0|Hmmm...when I heard the first single \\"Stupid Girls\\" I was afraid she may be selling (or already sold) out but then I bought the album! I was very impressed with her lyrics and her vocals. Besides \\"Stupid Girls\\" the song \\"U & Ur Hand\\" is funny and almost difficult to take seriously. The song \\"Dear Mr. President\\" with The Indigo Girls is what is missing from pop music. It does not matter what your political views may be, the passion and lyrical precision as well as the amazing harmonies from The Indigo Girls make this song fill the void left in pop music from superficial songs that have been released lately. The album is built around the idea of having each song have a different all-around sound, which works pretty well. I liked \\"Missundaztood\\" and this is right up there; because of its daring nature, impressive vocals, and personal lyricism.  <br /> <br />Best Songs: \\"Dear Mr. President,\\" \\"I Got Money Now,\\" \\"Runaway,\\" \\"The One That Got Away\\"
B000EULJLU|2.0|i think more thought was put into the 3-D glasses then the music.  <br /> <br />all kidding aside, i truly anticipated a chill-inducing masterpiece. i mean 5 years to write and rehearse? perhaps all the side projects are draining their efforts. <br /> <br />i'd still say buy it, it's not that I'm saying it's god-awful; i just had the bar set higher for a band of their caliber. <br />
B000002534|5.0|Apparently this album was a comercial let down.  I am hoping that a new generation will vindicate it.  It is sincere, it is fiery, don't get stuck on the lyrics, close your eyes and listen from end to end.  From the piece \\"Here and Now\\" to the end it is really one piece composed of movements that are hair raising if not enlightening.  I have never taken drugs but imagine a good drug trip to be like that album, esp. the instrumental last four pieces fused into one.  This is classic Santana, everything else after this album is nice, but never reached the honesty, bravery and sheer electrical magick of Borboletta. Buy it for your lover.
B000EULJLU|5.0|Master  mind.... your ...... manners.  Tool has RETurnED.  Piss upon your black halo.  Drift away away away.  Live to feel them steal you away.  Bravo!
B00005RYL9|5.0|Of all the crappy films that came out of the 80's *cough* Robocop *cough* this was one of the best releases.  Highlander mostly became an international phenomenon, but it did fairly well here in the states too. <br />  The story of Conner McCleod in the modern day, and his confrontation with a viscious villian from his past to become the one immortal left on Earth.  When one of them has accomplished this, then they will have won the prize. <br />  Conner's story is told through flashbacks to the past, when he lived in Scotland, and how he was trained by a Spainish-Egyption (yes, it is sort of lame to explain) named Ramierez (played by Sean Connerey!!!).   <br />   Besides showing the swrod trianing aspect, there is also the theme of \\"Who wants to live forever\\" (supplied by Queen who did the music).  This theme shows that an immortal life is one full of loss as you watch your loved ones die. <br />  Beyond the touchy-feely emotional themes, this is a great movie full of action and a great 80's vibe (the good kind, if that's possible). <br />   This immortal edition is not too bad either.  With a fairly decent print of the film on the disc (some graininess that couldn't be avoided), great sound, and a load of extras (three Queen music videos!!!).  Also there is the metal slip case, which is more for the Highlander nerds than anyone, and a seperate three song CD which has the track \\"Princes of the Universe\\" (which would later become the theme to the television series). <br />   So if you enjoy the movie, want to read a bit more on the movie, and love a unique packaging for your DVD's, Anchor Bay's release of Highlander the Immortal Edition is right up your alley.
B000000HU0|3.0|Originally released in 1976, after both Daevid Allen and Gilli Smyth had jumped the Gong mothership, as then drummer Pierre Moerlen (R.I.P.) had virtually taken over the band. The music on this CD reissue isn't at all bad - it's just not the Gong that I come to know. Upside is that four (4) of the tunes on this title also show up on the should-have 2005 archive release Gong - 'Live In Sherwood Forest, 1975' (see my review) where guitarist Steve Hillage rejoins the cosmic clan for a brief tour. Those four tracks are the well-written &#34;Wingful Of Eyes&#34;, &#34;Chandra&#34;, the semi-tripping &#34;Cat In Clark's Shoes&#34; and the title cut &#34;Shamal&#34;. Primarily for the Gong completists and die-hard fans.

THE CRUSADES ONLY OCCURRED BECAUSE THE CATHOLIC CHURCH COULD NOT ACCEPT THE FACT THAT THE BYZANTINE EMPIRE, A DOMINANT CHRISTIAN EMPIRE SUDDENLY FELL TO THE OTTOMAN TURKS (PREDOMINANTLY MUSLIMS).

B000ERU5EK|4.0|Above & Beyond put out their first artist album, and it's a donwtempo, chill type atmosphere, with a few upbeat tracks, like their smash hit, Air For Life, and the instrumental World on Fire.  You get about 4 female vocal tracks, 3 male vocal tracks, and the rest instrumentals.  ALL the instrumentals are very good tracks, with a wide range of melodic sounds, and for the most part, are the best part of this album.  The standouts include Indonesia and World On Fire.   <br /> <br />Air For Life, not really a vocal track with verses and a chorus, just some ethereal vocals, is a great track, but I am not to pleased with Zoe Johnston's track or the final female vocal track, Home.  They're a little too slow with less than exciting lyrics.  However, the absolute best track on this entire CD, and one of the top trance tracks I've EVER heard, is Can't Sleep, sung beautifully by Ashley Tomberlin of Luminary.  All the Luminary tracks, including their most recent Amsterdam, are all exceptional vocal tracks, and Above & Beyond certainly picked one of the classiest vocalists in trance right now for this one.  The only other question mark is why isn't Justine Suissa back for at least one track?  They've had so much success with her in the past (as Oceanlab), not to mention she is arguably the best trance vocalist of all time, you wonder why she wasn't asked to do something on here.  Anyway, Ashley more than makes up for Justine's absence and appears on what I consider to currently be the best vocal trance track of the year thus far. <br /> <br />As for the male vocal tracks, I believe they are all by the same guy who sings on Alone Tonight.  I don't care for his voice at all, which makes me not like any of these tracks.   <br /> <br />For the most part, a very good artist album, which seems to be hard to come by lately in trance.  Just don't expect an upbeat dance floor type mix, because you'd have to go to their previous mix CD's for that.  This is something very different, but very good.
B000EULJLU|5.0|It is impossible to put this album into words.  The only word that can describe it is \\"Beautiful!\\"  I am an extremely hardcore TOOL fan and was not expecting an album like this at all!  Many people who are into any past albums will probably find it hard to get into this album at first, as I did...but after a listen or two, you will realize just how beautiful this album is.  Every member of the band shines, the songs are beautiful and the musicianship is impeccable!  It will take me weeks to figure out some of the polyrhythms going into this music!  I will stop typing now because words will do this album no justice!  This album actually brought me to tears!  Anyone who says they do not like it has either not given it a chance, or they are just musically ignorant.
B00005JOFQ|5.0|My eyes are dried out now. Brokeback Mountain is the most beautiful and the most unforgetable movie of the year. Probably the best of all time. I feel fortunate to have seen it in my lifetime.
B000ETQRCM|5.0|I'll start off by saying I'm a huge PJ fan.  Have been since 9th grade when I bought \\"Ten\\" and listened to it the whole way from MO to FL on family vacation...then the whole time I was there...then the whole way back. <br /> <br />This album gives me the same feeling I had then.  And it's the first time in a long time.  In the past 15 years, I've phased out radio completely, and then, as I grew older, became remoter from college and hip friends, I've been exposed to less and less good music.  PJ is one of my consistent, buy-sight-unseen every new album, bands, but none of them in the past 10 years has captivated me the way this self-titled record does. <br /> <br />\\"Marker in the Sand\\" is the standout track, in my opinion.  Lyrically and musically it is profound, beautiful, and mixed-up.  It's the first song I've listened to on repeat since that depressive \\"Purple Rain\\" episode in college.  It's indicative of many of the tracks on this album, though, in that it mixes \\"traditional\\" PJ sounds: melodic ballad, hard wall of guitar, unexpected Gossard/Mccready exchanges, and sublime Vedder lyrics.  At first it sounds pretty hard-rocking and angry, enabling the melodic beauty of the chorus to hit you like a ton of bricks right in the chest.  And, the beauty of Eddie Vedder's writing: the lyrics fit the music perfectly.  The plaintive, \\"God, what do you say?  I'm calling out,\\" is the first time a rock song has made me cry in a long, long time.  Let's be honest, since \\"Alive.\\" <br /> <br />Though I agree with and admire PJ's politics, \\"Army Reserve\\" is a little too literal for my taste, though, again, the melody and musicality of this track is gorgeous.  Every other track on the album is amazing.  \\"Parachutes\\" reminds me of a White Album-era Beatles song in its simplicity and depth.  \\"Life Wasted\\" is a life-affirming, rocking, melodic anthem in the tradition of \\"I Am Mine\\" and \\"Come Back\\" is just sweetly, plaintively addictive. <br /> <br />McCready's lyrics on \\"Inside Job\\"are so raw and true and real.  I guess he's proven himself worthy on many levels, aside from the rock-guitar-god inspirer of the frat-boy \\"McCready\\" chants at all their live shows.  ;-) <br /> <br />Speaking of live shows, critics have been hailing this album as a \\"comeback,\\" but fans of PJ know them now primarily as a touring band and their live shows have done nothing but improve. <br /> <br />I'm seeing them for the third time on May 13 and I look forward to it as the religious experience it has been, and I know will be, for me.  The only difference this time is that I'll really be ROOTING for tracks off the new album, especially \\"Marker in the Sand.\\"  I know someone mentioned \\"Come Back\\" as the new \\"Yellow Ledbetter,\\" but for me it's \\"Marker in the Sand.\\"
B000EULJLU|5.0|There was a lot of hype and speculation surrounding the Tool album that became '10,000 Days'.  They are not the most prolific band in the world but they do have a reputation for excellence and the ability to constantly deliver the goods on every level.  The combination of these things made for a tense five-year wait for Tool fans but the album that resulted was worth every minute of that wait. <br /> <br />Obviously, the first thing I noticed about the album was the cover art.  It, much like the band, is instantly engrossing and completely unique.  I could have been preoccupied by it for hours, had I not wanted to hear the album so badly.  One of the band's trademarks is the time and attention they pay to the cover art, and '10,000 Days' is no exception.  It is challenging, to say the very least and there's no real way to describe it without seeing it for yourself. <br /> <br />Anyway, Tool's last album 'Lateralus', was a masterpiece of progressive rock that would be difficult to equal.  That being said, '10,000 Days' is an album coming from a completely different space so it would be unfair to compare the two.  'Lateralus' was ominous and meditative.  To me, it felt like it was coming from another planet and its true impact kind of crept up on the listener.  The spacey feel that 'Lateralus' had to it meant that there was plenty of room for contemplation.   <br /> <br />'10,000 Days', however, has a completely different kind of impact.  Right from the opening seconds, it hits you with a kind of anger and ferocity that hasn't been seen since the band's early work.  It is clear from the album's lyrical content (particularly songs like 'Vicarious') that the band is unhappy with the state of the world at the moment.  '10,000 Days' has some of the most overtly political material that Tool has written in years.  That open and honest anger is continued throughout the record.   <br /> <br />The new attitude of the band, however, does not sacrifice the complexity and attention to detail that we are used to hearing from Tool in a musical sense.  Musically, Tool is just as stunning as ever.  The complex instrumental passages, changes in tempo and dynamics and virtuosity are still present; there is just a heavy, dark edge to the music that we have not seen since the beginning of Tool's career.   <br /> <br />This new, revitalised band has managed to achieve the perfect marriage of musical complexly and outrage.  Tool just keeps getting better.
0553573403|5.0|Picked this book at random one day in a bookstore and I'm very glad I did. This is the first volume in a series of books called A Song Of Ice And Fire. Not really knowing what to expect as I don't read too much fantasy, though The Lord Of The Rings I still consider the best work of fiction I've ever read, this book overwhelmed me. It has a wonderful combination of action, intrigue, heartbreak, plus a wealth of characters from the very good to the unbelievably evil. I've since read all the other published installments and am eagerly awaiting the next. While Martin does jump around a bit because of all the characters and their sub-plots, it's not hard at all to keep up with the various developments. One aspect I really love is that just when you think a character is about to get out of a particular debacle, it only gets worse. What a change from the usual 'everything comes out okay at the end'.<br /><br />  This is loosely based on the Wars Of The Roses, so if you have any interest in that period of history, this is the book for you. Although in the fantasy genre, there's not a lot of use of magic or non-human beings, but when they are used, it's very important, such as dragons and special weapons. Since the series has been written over a span of ten years or so, the characters change, mature, develop different mind sets due to events - much like all of us. I wish I had discovered Martin sooner, he's become one of my favorite writers. I highly recommend this book and the series overall.
B000AADYRQ|5.0|From the beginning to the end, deathcab takes the listener through the emotional spectrum. Plans is a absolutely classic release as every song on it makes most stuff on the radio pale in comparison to the artistry in the music and the lyrics.  <br /> <br />Note: If you like this cd be sure to pick up the dvd companion to it...it doesnt disappoint either.
0440180295|5.0|This is just a great book. Its a little science fiction, a little war, and a lot of a great book. It is interesting, insightful, and in a strange way, real. Although the main charecter goes through some interesting situations, you always maintain he is an average guy, just like you and me, and that is the beauty of the book. <br />Read it, you wont be disapointed
B000EULJLU|3.0|The 3 or 4 non-filler songs on this album are good but not great. I have to disagree with many of the people who have reviewed this album so far and said it was awesome or any similar thing. It's not...the filler songs are moody music that perhaps could play in the background while i was doing something else. This is not what i expected, although Tool never really does the expected and thats what makes them great. Perhaps after a few more listens i'll learn to love it, but so far just not enough rock...who knows in a week or two i may like the album better than the other Tool releases, thats usually how great progressive bands work. However, i would say buy it for the packaging alone...Awesome packaging. Like i said though...it is sub-par for Tool...but that still means its better than most of the junk being released.
076790592X|5.0|It takes two hours, at the most three, to read this book. Do yourself a favor, read it. As an adult, midway through my life, if i could choose only one book to read for the rest of my life, this would certainly be it. It is inspiring, sad, hopeful, intelligent, tradgic, and funny all at once. <br />Read this book- you wont regret it, in fact, you'll thank me.
B000ETQRCM|5.0|I bought this as an afterthought when i picked up the new Tool cd. I used to be a huge Pearljam fan and still listen to their older stuff, but the last album or two have just not been that great. I was really surprised by both purchases...Tool...disappointed...but PJ greatly surprised. I loved most of it and even the songs i didnt like have started to grow on me. This cd reminds me why i loved the music these guys created. However, that being said...my PJ fandom has been strained in the past because of political views i dont agree with, but this album(as with most of the others) dont try to force their beliefs down your throat...they are there in the songs but the songs benefit from them. The lyrics make good arguments and the overall heart of the lyrics and the music is overwhelming. Wonderful cd.
0812976525|5.0|This book held a special place in my heart, as a smoker, but after reading it I realized that it is a good book for anyone to read that pokes fun at the whole cigarette industry, the governments actions towards it, and even todays media. It is a funny book that isnt too opinionated and is interesting to people in any walk of life.  <br />An easy, funny book that is interesting and entertaining, well worth the time it takes to read.
0553579908|4.0|Have you ever been weary of seeing a sequel because you know it will not be nearly as good as the original? Or have you been hesitant to see a something a second time because you just know it will not be as good as it was the first time? I have. And that is how I felt as I tried to talk myself into reading A Clash of Kings. At a time when I was struggling to find any books that I was enthusiastic about, I read the first of this 4-(so far)-part series, A Game of Thrones. I enjoyed it so thoroughly I was hesitant to read the second installment. I was skeptical. The book could not be as good, I thought. The book will tarnish the near perfect reputation of its predecessor, I told myself. That is not fair, I reasoned. And I decided that it was time to read the second book. <br /> <br />To be fair, A Clash of Kings is not as good as A Game of Thrones. From a chronological standpoint I feel that it would essentially be impossible for the second book to be as good as or better than the first. The first was the introduction; everything was new. In the second book, though there is still more to introduce and many things are new, the story continues. And there is much more to come.  <br /> <br />I apologize if this comparison carries a negative connotation, because it is not my intent. Book two of the A Song of Ice and Fire series by George R. R. Martin, in my opinion bears a resemblance to J. R. R. Tolkien's The Two Towers (also the second book of its series). Both books have \\"set-up\\" roles. A lot happens without anything happening, if you follow what I am saying. The pieces are put into place in these books, and they are poised for action in the book(s) to come. That is not to say that there is any lack of action in A Clash of Kings. Far from it, rather. The story is ready to pounce. Book three, A Storm of Swords, should be a thrill ride. <br /> <br />I am still fascinated by the chapter style. Through the entire series George R. R. Martin chooses a handful of characters andeach chapter is from the perspective of one of them. Readers are able to be essentially omniscient in the realm of the Seven Kingdoms by seeing the trials and tribulations of characters good and bad, here and there. The book is a series of cliffhangers and it makes the suspense pleasurable is a strange masochistic sort of way. The tension will build and build and then just as it nears its apex, the chapter ends. The action picks up from that point...or not...a few chapters later. It sounds more frustrating than fun, but when you read the books it is actually fun and not frustrating. It also makes the books easier to get through. You will fly through a few chapters to get to the next part about whatever character you are following.  <br /> <br />I know that sci-fi/fantasy books are daunting. They seem to all be 700-1100 pages and most are but one piece of a multi-part series. It makes for a lot of reading because by taking the first you may be signing yourself up to read an entire series. I feel the same way and I just try to space the books out so it does not seem as bad. I have a decent memory and found that even though I read the first book almost eight months ago, I was able to pick up right where the story left off. I did not have to re-acclimate myself with the story. This was important because the author does not take time to recap what happened in the previous book. There is a lot of detail and it would make a long book even longer to go through it all.  <br /> <br />I do not read many books in this genre, but I truly get excited about these books. I loved A Clash of Kings and I loved A Game of Thrones before it. I look forward to continuing this series.
0812550757|5.0|If you liked Ender's Game (which just about everybody does) then this is a must read. This is one of my favorite books and in many ways is actually better than Enders Game. It has all of the wit and cunning of the first book with a whole new scientific and theological addition as well as developing many characters instead of only Andrew Wiggin. <br />No matter what you are interested in, this book is compeling and worth the time it takes to read- makes you want to be a speaker for the dead whan you grow up.
1594200823|5.0|This is one of those rare books that gets a person thinking seriously about topics not usually pondered:  How has our food system, in just a few decades, developed into today's industrial, factory-fed, subsidized corn-based model?  What are the costs and consequences of the model?  Who pays them? Why is our system usually portrayed as the only viable means to feed ourselves?  Who's in control?  Is organic any better?   <br /> <br />\\"Dilemma\\" is engaging and readable, the type of book you'll find yourself mentioning and recommending to friends, even if you're among the majority of Americans (like me) who puts more thought into the gas we put into our cars than the food we put into our mouths.   <br /> <br />There are indictments here of the industrial food system, the politics, special interests, and marketers that brought the system to its dominate role, and the price-obsessed consumer who buys into the system asking no questions.  There's also a clear explanation that gives many of us our first awareness of how petroleum-dependent our food system is.  We are, in a real sense, eating petroleum when we eat many food products because synthetic fertilizers and pesticides are manufactured from oil and gas.  <br /> <br />The book also gives insights into the environmental costs today's over-fertilized, monospeciatic, concentrated feed-lot systems have on the land, water, and air.  It's not a pretty picture.  And the questions Pollan raises about animal ethics are important, leading the reader to ask himself whether choices I make in the grocery are consistent with my views on how animals should be treated.  For example, the usual supermarket egg is produced by a chicken that \\"lives\\" its entire productive life in a horrendous cramped cage.  Just so we can buy eggs for 79 cents/dozen.   <br /> <br />This book was a pleasure to read.  Even if it turns out that all the numbers he cites arn't exactly accurate, or that there are other views to counter the points he makes (andthere are), there's a lot here to get one thinking, and maybe change the way we make our food choices.   <br /> <br />The only flaws I would mention are that it could've benefited from better editing to tighten it up, especially the foraging section.  One chapter includes at least twenty quotes from a philosopher of hunting.  Enough! And there is a place or two that the same points are repeated.   <br /> <br />All in all an important book.   <br /> <br />
0446608955|5.0|I love this book. <br />I love the movie, but the book is much better. Its just a great story told by the master of love stories. I dont know anybody who can read this book and not want to cry. <br />just read it. its not worth missing.
0345423496|3.0|Clarke returns to the universe of 2001: A Space Odyssey with the fourth and last novel, this time focusing on Frank Poole, the astronaut murdered by Hal in 2001.  A thousand years later, Poole's frozen corpse is retrieved and revived by a society that regards him as a hero and a living national treasure. At first he's fully occupied with learning to live in an alien society and providing information to historians. But as boredom sets in, he finds himself drawn back to space and the Jupiter system... and the possibility of a meeting with David Bowman.<br /><br />As Clarke notes in an afterword, it's not possible to be completely consistent in a series about the near future  that was written over a period of thirty years, and this book  is better viewed as a variation on a theme rather than a sequel. With that in mind, the within series continuity glitches aren't an issue, although there are a couple of annoying glitches within the book's own timeline. The real problem is that this book is mostly a travelogue of the year 3001, with the section about the monoliths feeling sketchy and tacked on. There's also a problem with some blatant preaching in places, when characters who are supposed to be having a conversation sound more as if they're reading a prepared speech to sway an audience. I found it annoying, and I agree with many of the views being espoused.<br /><br />It's a readable and often enjoyable book, but I expect better from Clarke. I'd have felt cheated if I'd spent the money to buy this in hardback.
0790729741|5.0|This is a Warner feature and is the best live-actionVERSUScartoon since Disney`s Mary Poppins 1964. Its brilliance in all departments is a treasure to behold. The timing is immaculate:-) A CLASSIC
B000000WHC|5.0|I find this CD to be a classic of modern electric blues in the vein of SRV, Albert Collins, Ronnie Earl and Robben Ford. If you like your blues on the electric side, and appreciate raw guitar done well, you will love this disk. The sound clips speak for themselves. Yes, I know classic/traditional blues fans may not like it, but it is modern electric blues, enhanced by some real rockers. <br /> <br />For the guys that gave this CD but one star, go back to reviewing Prince CDs and leave this stuff alone. Beauty is in the eye of the beholer, and this is beautiful stuff!
B000EULJLU|3.0|Listen i love tool. from there first \\"album\\" opiate up to now with 10,000 days. the only thing is that i was excpecting the songs to be more like the first song on the album \\"vicarious\\". I was a little dissapointed after the first listen threw the album, but it's one of those albums that grows on you after you listen to a bunch of times. the whole album is very pink floydish. with random noises, trippy effects, its a stoners paradise. it is deffinetly tool, yet at the same time, not at all. but hey, atleast they didn't sell out. if you like pink floyd you'll like this album.
0529064847|1.0|I heartily agree with several of the other reviewers: the NAB's text (interminably revised and consequently unstable) is, at best, a weak or banal rendering of Sacred Scripture itself, and the NAB's Reading Guides, Commentary and Footnotes are often vigorously anti-Catholic--that is, blatantly Protestant--in content.  For example, look at the footnote to 1 Corinthians 3:15 that denies the doctrine of Purgatory finding a basis in this passage of scripture--a passage that has been proposed, dogmatically, as a \\"proof text\\" for the doctrine of Purgatory!  A blasphemous treatment of Catholic scripture!    However, after reading Pope Leo XIII's \\"Providentissimus Deus\\" alongside Vatican II's \\"Dei Verbum,\\" with the latter full of practical loopholes and near-wholesale departures from Traditional Catholic teaching on Sacred Scripture, it's easy, frightful and saddening to see why and how the NAB went awry to the obvious extreme(s) evident to orthodox Catholics.      Having been too often disappointed and infuriated with the faithless, \\"dynamically\\" translated NAB, I opted instead for the faithful, literally translated Douay-Rheims Bible, painstakingly derived from the Latin Vulgate, the Bible declared to be a sure, inerrant norm for Catholic docrine by the Council of Trent.  The D-R provides a firm and unabashed foundation for Traditional Roman Catholic doctrine, something seriously lacking in the NAB and generally ignored by the hierarchy of the steeply backsliding \\"Euro-\\" and \\"Am-\\" churches (which have shamelessly and publicly abandoned their Roman Catholic heritage).    The NAB (suitable for liberal Protestants, not orthodox Catholics), together with the abuse-ridden Novus Ordo Mass and the awful English translations of the New Roman Missal and the Liturgy of the Hours, constitute a multi-pronged, all-out attack on Roman Catholic Tradition and orthodoxy, waged squarely upon the \\"lex orandi, lex credendi\\" front.      May Our Lord and Our Lady help us, as we pray and do penance for the mess the Church finds herself in!
B000EULJLU|5.0|In my opinion, this album is Tool's best work. With Maynard taking a step back from the spot light and lightening up on the lyrics; seemlessly making the rest of the instruments the main factor to take you on the journey. No more listening, memorizing, and walking away with a catchy vocal tune in your head; trying to interrupt the meaning. The excellent bass, guitar, and drum work; completly flows perfect, matching the mood of the world these days.  <br /> <br />This album shines new light into the spectrum of music itself. Great work to the band and Alex Grey on the artwork, once again. <br /> <br />If you fancy, memorizing and singing along to songs - this cd isn't for you. ^^
B000ETQRCM|5.0|This album is one of Pearl Jam's best.  It blends the sounds of some of their earlier work (Vitalogy, No Code, Vs.) yet has its own distinctive sound.  If you prefer the harder side of Pearl Jam, the first five songs are no brainers.  But, some of the slower songs on this album are some of their best work.  The last track, 'Inside Job' is simply amazing.  I recommend listening to the album a couple of times to let things set in and then listening to the album with headphones.  There are so many subtleties to be picked up.  Amazing album.
B000EULJLU|4.0|I think some of the other reviewers for album went to the wrong section.  There is a place for children under the age of 13 to place their review.  To state that there is not much music on this album is childish and whomever feels this way is obviously listening to the wrong album.  It is a Tool album.  It's not easy to listen to.  It takes time and builds and grows on you.  If you listen to it once, the new and experimental notes will not make sense for such fragile young minds.  Anyways along with my review.  This album kicks ASSSSSSSSS!  It will rock your socks off and make you think at the same time.  Another reviewer pointed out that this album is not a huge departure from the sound of Lateralus, which is true.  My feeling about Lateralus, while still a great album, it seemed that they were diving into fresh territory and had not fully honed their skills.  Much like Undertow before Aenima.  This album is skillfully put together just as Aenima, but also contains the experimental wanderings that propelled Lateralus to such heights.  I would have given it 5 stars, but I would have liked to see them take it a little further, but this is still a rock solid album from a rock solid band and any fan of Tool's music should not listen to the other reviews and buy 10,000 Days!  Hell, it's worth the price for the packaging alone.
B0006L16N8|5.0|hey, this is bloody good.  listen to it in the summer in your car, outside, wherever...its a good summer album.  or just over analyze it and be angry because thats fun too.
B0000074FB|5.0|this is one of my fav. Thin Lizzy cds. it's has lots of different cool songs.
B000EULJLU|3.0|The 10 minutes of music that is actually found on this CD is quite good.  <br /> <br />The album is barley listenable as it sporadically intertwines with really GOOD music.  There just isn't enough actual MUSIC on the album. Another annoyance is that the songs seem to build and build so well (in classic Tool fashion), and then leads NOWHERE. <br /> <br />10,000 days has fallen very short of what I expected from Tool, and I think any musician or true music lover would agree with that.  Tool's earlier work was so musically rich that it MOVED me.  I couldn't say the same for this album if a gun was held to my head. <br /> <br />I'm tired of really great bands putting out stuff like this and everyone using the excuse, \\"they have grown musically and spiritually and this album reflects that.\\"  This album does not reflect that, nor does it give testament to the talents or artistry of Tool.  This album is almost LAZY. <br /> <br />A once GREAT band has gone the way of, dare I say it, METALLICA!   <br /> <br />...And everyone is just afraid to come to that realization. <br />
B000EULJLU|5.0|Im reading a lot of haters on this cd but i have to say i love 10000 days. Im a tool fan for many years and i think this is some of there best work. I think every tool fan or anyone else wanting something that really rocks to buy this cd. <br />Vicarious 10\10 One of the best songs on the album, starts light and becomes heavy. <br />Jambi 8\10 Maynard lyrics are what takes the cake here <br />wings of marie(part 1) 7\10 part two is much better <br />10000 days (part 2) 10/10 I love this song thats all i have to say about it <br />the pot 9/10 this song really grown on me even if maynard sounds funny <br />lipan conjuring n\a just a filler <br />lost keys n\a another filler <br />rosetta stoned 10\10 Awsome <br />intension 6\10 its okay maybe it will grow on me more <br />right in two 10\10 best song on the album <br />viginti tres n\a i wish the ended the cd with a real song not a filler <br /> <br />total 9\10 <br /> <br />the cd is defiantley worth it, songs like vicarious,jambi,10000 days, the pot, and right in two are all most listens. I wish there were more songs though which prevented this from me giving it a ten.
B000EULJLU|5.0|My introduction to Tool came some years ago, when I first heard \\"Schism\\". Having been listening to Iron Maiden, Dream Theater, et al. before then, I wasn't a stranger to the genre, and I clicked immediately. After acquiring \\"Lateralus\\" and listening through it thouroughly, I bought Opiate, Aenima and Undertow, which gave me an odd, backwards perspective of the band's evolution.    After some deliberation, I found Lateralus to be the best Tool album at that time, with the band showing far more rounded musicianship, not to mention the superior production of the album. Aenima and Undertow, in retrospect, sounded almost crude in comparison.    Well, that now applies to Lateralus as well. With 10,000 Days, Tool push themselves further into the Progressive realm, giving their new album a far richer, denser sound, with a decidedly international flavour. Their tempestuous, lurching sound is now layered with nearly Eno-esque droning and swooping in the background, giving the music an enveloping, monumental sound, a very entrancing experience. Keenen's crisper, more emotional vocals are a highly welcome evolution here.    Add to this the fact that the musicianship and production go over and above that of Lateralus, and you have a solid, most impressive album from a band known for its ambivalence towards trends, and perhaps even its fans. They have forged ahead with their vision, and I'm loving every minute of the ride.
B000040OBS|4.0|Alan Vega and Martin Rev were WAAAY ahead of their time. Though their debut wasn't officially released until '78 (and even then, it predated the debuts of Joy Division, Killing Joke, The Cure, and possibly even PiL by about a year or so), this guitarless NY duo had been around since '71.<br /><br />Anyway this album is the genesis of post-punk/New Wave, performed with a beat-up organ/synthesizer Rev probably found in the back alley of a music shop, and a decrepit but chugging drum machine that brings a futuristic pulse to the eerie synths and Alan Vega's voice, which sounds like Elvis detained in Guantanomo. Very original, very creepy, and very cool.<br /><br />The material varies from what would be otherwise poppy tracks made slightly unnerving due to their foreboding starkness (Girl, Cheree, Keep Your Dreams) to more haunting and atmospheric songs (Ghost Rider, Rocket USA, Che) and even one track that sounds a bit like a primitive Doors cut (I Remember).<br /><br />Then there's the 10-minute Frankie Teardrop--perhaps one of the most terrifying and claustrophobic songs ever released, with Vega's banshee screams punctuating the narrative of a young factory worker who kills himself and his own family out of desperation and wakes up in hell. The conclusion, with its ominous synths and Vega sounding as if he's going insane from the horror around him, will leave a scar on your mind.<br /><br />The bonus material includes a decent, if roughly recorded CBGB's performance and the confrontational and chaotic \\"23 Minutes Over Brussels\\" show which is important for historical reasons, I suppose, but isn't worth listening to more than once or twice. The first disc is all you need to know. A bit primitive and dated in places, but still vital, influential, and amazing for fans of the genre.
B000EULJLU|5.0|This album is all Tool.<br /><br /> The highs and lows of epic songs and beautiful arangements.<br /><br /> The only down side is that out of the 11 songs maybe only 8 of them are real songs and not filler but then again the length of each song more than makes up for it.<br /><br /> Buy this album today!!!
B000AADYYO|5.0|Opeth has never made any huge changes between their albums until now.. Ghost Reveries takes a new turn while still sticking to the wonderful Opeth signature sound. Besides the great production, and the additional keyboardist, the greatest change is the complexity of the music. Opeth seems to have turned away from the more atmospheric sound to show their expert musicianship. Even though 'My Arms Your Hearse' is and will always be my favorite Opeth album, 'Ghost Reveries' is essentual to every Opeth fan.
B000ETQRCM|2.0|OK, so here it is. I've been waiting for this album for awhile now and especially since Eddie Vedder in an interview mentioned how hard and raw this album would be.<br /><br /> So here it is and well....uh<br /><br /> This album is by far my least fave and that is coming from someone who has all of the studio stuff, the b-sides and many of the concerts.<br /><br /> Pearl Jam just can not do the mid tempo stuff. Many of these songs lack a clear riff and just sound like unintelligiable singing/mumbling over a fast guitar.<br /><br /> The baritone singing is almost non-existent. The best song \\"inside man\\" has lyrics not even written by Vedder. \\"Gone\\" and \\"Comeback\\" are really the only other standout tracks, and all three of these are the slow songs.<br /><br /> On another note, I know Eddie Vedder's stance on the war and I don't need another album about it. This whole album is basically an anti-war album. I disagree with most of Vedder's politics but Riot Act was still a good album, this album is bogged down by his political writing.<br /><br /> The music also lacks the emotion of the last albums.<br /><br /> I gave this album three stars to start with but now after really writing down all of my thoughts I have to change it to 2 stars.<br /><br /> It's Pearl Jam so you have to buy it but buyer beware it is mostly lackluster.
B000EULJLU|5.0|This is one out of two of my favorite tool albums, right next to Aenima. The most obvious difference from this album and their previous ones is the length of the songs. Most of them clock in over 7 min. This is a very progressive album, with many shifts and changes making 10,000 days a very entertaining listen the whole way through. Maynard also experiments a little bit with vocal styles, adding a lot to the new tool sound. very atmospheric and very dark, this is a definate worthy purchase to anyone who enjoys challenging music.
B000ETQRCM|5.0|I really enjoyed listening to this new CD from Pearl Jam. The themes on this album like suicide, loss and alienation are things  that many bands do not address enough, and I really admire Pearl Jam for including songs like this on their latest CD.  My favorite track is Life Wasted.  I had to listen  to it several times before I understood what it meant.  This  tune is  about how precious life is.  Mike McCready gives this song an energetic pulsating beat on the guitar that compliments Eddie Vedder's vocals so  well.  World Wide Suicide is another fast hard track.  This is a song about it feels likes to have a sense of hopelessness about life.  Comatose is a short  fearless fast track highlighted by drummer Matt Cameron's awesome drum beat.  Unemployable is another highlight track.  This song is about the pressure a man feels being unemployed and trying to support his family.  I think a lot of people can relate to the lyrics of this song.  Come Back is another gem on this disc.  This song is about losing someone close to you and wishing that they would come back.  Eddie sings this song with such feeling.  Gone is another good song about losing faith in the American dream.  Eddie has a such a deep sexy voice, and he sounds great here.  I enjoyed this CD very much.
B000000H42|5.0|This is the greatest metal album ever created as far as I'm concerned. A true cornerstone for heavy metal in general. Fronted by the infamous King Diamond, 'Dont Break the Oath' is truly a haunting journey. Every fan of metal needs this album.
B00008OLYN|5.0|I cant belive u Opeth. <br />u just expressed my feelings. <br />U r supernatural with ur talent. <br />U r the best Band in the world .
B0006M4SO6|5.0|i don't know how to express in words how amazing this disc is.  I've been listening to nothing else (in the car) since I got it a month ago.  While the disc purports to have 4 tracks, it's essentially one long symphony.  I personally don't understand how someone can compose music like this and play it so well, but I can definitely listen to it, and it brings me joy.  The richness of the composition is unparalled in Metheny/Mays history, and the title \\"This Way Up\\" seems to suggest this.  It will grow on you with repeated listenings, to the point where you wonder if you'll ever be satisfied with anything less from any other artists.  There is only one other band that reaches the peaks of excellence reached by these cats, and that is the YellowJackets.  I've said it before and I'll say it again, I think Russel Ferrante, Pat Metheny, and Lyle Mays are not from this planet.  Maybe they're on loan from Heaven.  All I know is they take me there.
0743454537|1.0|First, a disclaimer: I usually stick to classic, critically-acclaimed novels.  I rarely read authors who monopolize a genre with one serially-produced formula (although I did read \\"The Shining\\" when I was eleven) and so I admit that Jodi Picoult's family dramas are not my normal fare.  However, I was intrigued by the premise of \\"My Sister's Keeper\\" and encouraged by some good reviews.  When it was chosen by my book club, I was excited to read it and completely open to enjoying it.<br /><br />Unfortunately, this is one of the most inane things I have ever read.  The legal battle takes off before the characters are developed (and don't hold your breath - they never obtain that crucial third dimension), precluding emotional investment on either side.  The main character's motivation for taking such drastic action is not satisfactorily explained, either.  Of course the reader can infer why she feels the way she does about her situation but I could have gotten that much from reading the back cover; I expect a little more insight when I take the time to read the novel.<br /><br />Cookie cutter characters and timing issues aside, Picoult's choppy and unimaginative writing does not help.  She rarely tends toward the figurative (but not in the good, Samuel Beckett kind of way) and her rare incursions into poesy are contrived.  The phrase \\"a sluice of a boy,\\" for example, just barely makes sense and made me wonder where the humanoid streamlet's flood valve was located.  Also, please be aware that Picoult's standard gimmick is rotating narrators and that each character has their own typeface - it's totally obnoxious.<br /><br />OK, that's enough ranting.  I'm just disappointed that a premise with such rich potential ended up reading like a screenplay for an episode of \\"Law and Order\\" and I really wanted to spare people from reading this.  Instead, I'd recommend Atul Gawande's best-selling \\"Complications\\" if you're looking for musings on medical ethics.  Or \\"The Corrections\\" by Jonathan Franzen excels in recreating believable family dysfunction.  With books like those out there, there is no excuse for wasting your time with \\"My Sister's Keeper.\\"  Happy reading!ions\\" by Jonathan Franzen excels in recreating believable family dysfunction.

B000EULJLU|3.0|You know, Tool have become extremely adept at making fascinating songs that stretch for upwards of 14 minutes, infusing their albums with intriguing, brief interludes, and having an uncommonly strong equilibrium between intelligent lyrics, varied vocals, and instrumental innovation.  While their earlier efforts (\\"Opiate\\" and \\"Undertow\\") now seem painfully juvenile, doing cartwheels to try to draw attention to themselves (reaching their pretentious peak with the ridiculously long 'Disgustipated'), their subsequent efforts now shine that much more.  \\"Aenima\\" was incredibly varied, challenging, and compulsively listenable; \\"Lateralus\\" housed some of the most layered, intricate, and intelligent songs to fall under the label of 'heavy metal.'  Five years later, \\"10,000 Days\\" dips back into the \\"Lateralus\\"' pot for an album that feels largely recycled, from the guitar riffs to percussion; in all fairness, Tool has carried certain 'signature sounds' from album to album, but when I hear tracks heavy with the influence of 'Stinkfist' or 'The Grudge,' I begin to wonder if the band is just lying down on the job because they can afford to.  The familiarity of much of the album would be a bit more forgivable if the charismatic and challenging performance of vocalist Maynard James Keenan were more pronounced; but unlike Tool's previous efforts, the frontman's voice is, for the most part, pushed behind the instrumentation (this could very well be because his lyrics contain 1/8 of the creativity they had before...even his APC work is superior to this drivel).  Therefore, what we're left with in \\"10,000 Days\\" is a very thinly-veiled sequel to \\"Lateralus,\\" and depending on your appraisal of that album (mine happened to be very favorable), you might be able to excuse a lot of the creative impotence at 'work' here.  The album itself is highly listenable, with songs that don't possess the structural tightness of those on \\"Lateralus,\\" but sound well enough ('Vicarious,' 'Jambi,' '10,000 Days,' and 'Right in Two' are fine examples).  The album also contains some of the most creative packaging and artwork I've ever seen (and by itself would merit the sticker price).  I think the crux of my disappointment in \\"10,000 Days\\" is that, overall, \\"it's a good album,\\" but it wouldn't have taken a lot to make it \\"that much better.\\"Days,' and 'Right in Two' are fine examples).

B000EULJLU|5.0|Weird,(but in a good way)great tool album. <br />Tool fans will love it. New listeners to tool <br />should probably listen to past albums before or <br />after listening to this either way metal/rock fans will probably <br />like this psychedelic sound!!!
B000EULJLU|5.0|The album is fantastic. Just my opinion.<br /><br />This comment is more based on the ARTWORK of the album tho. I'm sure about 100 of the people who reviewed this album just downloaded it illegally and decided to be high and mighty critics.<br /><br />Anyone who BOUGHT the album should be raving mad about the artwork on the CD.<br /><br />The CD comes with kickass 3D lenses on the case itself. You open up the CD, look through the lenses and see just the most sickest 3D pictures you've ever seen. There is one specific 3D photo for each band member (my fav being the one with Maynard offering you a glass of wine, looks so real that you wanna accept it), as well as several others that just look absolutely amazing. It's a lil hard to focus on them at first, but you'll get it.<br /><br />I give this CD 5 Stars for the entire package. The music itself, very good, but on the whole, I'd only rate the album 4.5 stars. It has it's flaws and even has a cheesy moment on it with a fake hospital skit or something.<br /><br />For Tool tho, it's a fine fine fine release, and nothing short of quality. I'm in no way any sort of rabid fanboy as I only listen to Tool casually (left my metal roots for hiphop years ago, but there's always room for Tool). I enjoy all thier albums and can't really choose a favorate, but honestly if I was forced to choose one, this wouldnt be it. That doesnt mean you shouldnt get it tho, it's badass.<br /><br />Also, anyone else kinda get that Pink Floyd - Animals vibe off this album?<br /><br />People who like to collect neat CD's should buy the first run of this CD right away, as it will be something cool you can treasure forever. I seriously doubt theyre gonna be doing runs of this particular case for the rest of it's duration of being printed.
B000ETQRCM|5.0|Just a rockin album!!! A great rush of music! <br />sounds awesome, pearl jam fans will not be dissapointed. <br />anyone who likes rock music/pearl jam fans who doesn't <br />have this album......GET IT!!!!! <br />
B000EULJLU|1.0|Hat's off to those who can say when the Emperor has no clothes!   <br /> <br />The marketing geniuses have successfully pulled the wool over the eyes of many, despite providing some magnifying spectacles!  Based on 80% of the reviews here, many, many ToolSheep are following this band off the cliff that is 10,000 Days... <br /> <br />This is a woeful effort, not a worthy of such a great band - by any stretch of an artistic imagination.  It sounds as though it were a bunch of B-side castoffs of past works; in fact, it sounds like bits and pieces of past compositions pieced together.  None of the songs sound original, or achieve to deliver the epic sound which had become the trademark of my favorite band.  These songs just drone on with boring riffs and the occasional simple hook.  This failure is compounded by the inexcusable 20 mins of ambient filler - which ultimately makes listening straight through the CD almost unbearable. <br /> <br />The production is muddy, the soaring guitars gone, the vocals are way in the back - to where I cannot make out most of Maynard's lyrics on several songs.  However, the biggest disappointment is that the songs are just plain uninspired retreads.  I can enjoy parts of some songs, like Vicarious, Jambi, Wings Part II and Right In Two; but there is little progression in each, and much repetition.  Whereas past Tool classics \\"take you somewhere\\"; these offerings leave me WAITING and WAITING to go somewhere. <br /> <br />I feel as though this might be the end of Tool, and they reassembled to throw out one last hodgepodge of a cd with much hype and fancy packaging.  The Toolsheep are raving.  I am sad.
B0009X766Y|5.0|I hadn't seen this one since it first came out, though I had seen it several times back then.  What a delight to revisit something of this quality and style.  Newman and Redford were at the very top of their form.  But perhaps that's saying too little of them since they've continued to produce superb performances since.  What delighted even more is that there isn't a single performance flaw anywhere in the film.  Each actor turns in a bravura performance IN THAT ROLE.  It's what I've come to expect in the British films where even four year olds shine through like masters.  It's not generally been the case with American films.  The relationship between the two stars is very different than that they showed us in Butch Cassidy.  But they both seem to relax and find the intricacies of their parts tending to make you lose track of the fact that it's two major stars.  You believe them, just as they are.  Robert Shaw, Henry VIII in Man For All Seasons, turns in one of his more chilling performances as the mobster target of the sting operation.  A great DVD to own and return to every couple of years.
0143057375|5.0|This book (audio version) not only gives the down-to-earth explanations of our existance but gives us the tools so we can become aware and make changes we wish to make.  I am an avid reader on this type of work from many sources but this book far exceeds most.  I resonated with what was said and understood with ease.  I will listen to this book many times as it is a comfort as well as instructional.
B000F0UV0E|5.0|It really makes me sick how hard wannabes try to stand out. Obviously the Amazon official reviewer (Alanna Nash) is a complete incompetent: a person who can't sense the beauty and the depth of WHATEVER Mark Knopfler writes, sings and plays has no right to write such a disgusting review on this beautiful album. As a musician myself I consider Mark Knopfler a true musical genius and in this album the unmistakable sound of Knopfler's guitar and the voice of Emmylou Harris are a match made in heaven. Maybe Ms. Alanna needs a better set of speakers at home, or maybe a new set of ears!
1594200823|5.0|This book is both well-written and thought-provoking, without being preachy.  The author points out that Americans have become disconnected from their food sources.  Everything just materializes in the grocery store and is consumed without a thought as to where the food comes from, or the impact that our consumption of that food has on ourselves and the rest of the planet.  The author examines the origins of a McDonald's meal, an Organic Meal, an integrated Farm Raised Meal and a Hunter-Gatherer Meal and tries to trace the impacts of each.  Although I grew up on a farm myself and hunted for food when I was young, I'd almost forgotten the ramifications of my dietary choices.  This book elegantly reminded me of things I had almost forgotten.  Is a chicken raised on a farm where it is free to roam better for you and the world than one raised and slaughtered in an industrial farm?  Is it ethical to eat meat at all?  How should we consider the use of petroleum in terms of the global cost of raising corn?<br /><br />This book is not about telling you what you should and should not eat.  It is about allowing yourself to develop your own answers to questions that many don't want to think about.  This is the best book I've read this year.
B000005Z0E|4.0|2Pac is just one of those artists that gets better with time.  From the start of his career up until his life was tragically cut short, 2Pac always refined his music and always had new ideas for songs.  2Pacalypse Now is early 2Pac when he was young and arrogant, and it shows.  The beats in 2Pacalypse Now are not as strong or catchy as in his later albums, the lyrics are less refined, and the overall flow of the cd is not as fluid as his later work.  However, this CD is still great and is definitely a must-have for any 2Pac fan.  But, if you are new to 2Pac I highly recommend buying \\"All Eyez on Me\\" and \\"Me Against the World\\" first.
B00005JOEA|5.0|Most main stream movies that are presented to the public are to fill a specific void the media creates. Some emotion or feeling is usually temporarily filled - the action, lust whatever. I'm not that old so I won't list an award list that I own, but I absolutely was blown away with this movie! I seriously cannot wait to experience it again on 1080p HD 7.1 Surround Sound and grasp all the details all over again. This is what a movie is supposed to do: make the viewer want to do something, grasp an emotion, show an idea will never die with dedication. It took that concept and ran with it! Just love this movie.
B000301YY8|4.0|Much of the criticism one hears of Blunt comes from the British chattering classes. Clearly, the intelligentsia has a problem with Blunt's status as a decorated combat vet. Of course, they would never admit it, but instead attack his masculinity, saying he \\"sings like a girl.\\"  If so, what would they say about one of my favorites, Michael Stipe? <br /> <br />Not a great CD , but very good. \\"Cry\\" is especially moving. In it he talks about the things he's seen--things his working-class hero critics will never see from the safety of their tacky flats. Buy the CD and judge for yourself.
B000EJ9MTW|4.0|Wolf attacks America, film at eleven...<br /><br />Believe the hype, this wolf will survive. If you don't believe me consider the following: One month ago, after hearing their classic rock \\"Dimension\\" ep, I decided to buy the import version of \\"Wolfmother\\". The black haired pierced to the brow clerk (at a well known music chain) sneered at me with \\"wolf what!?; never heard of em.\\" Flash forward one month: Wolfmother's \\"White Unicorn\\" is blaring from the same store's stereo. The cd is flying off the five foot display rack (band picture included). The same snobby clerk is bobbing his head to the Zeppelin/Sabbath riffs. This band has arrived (I was just a little early to the party). If you like louder than love rock chords, fantasy imagery and seventies fun look no further than Wolfmother. Who cares if they sound like your parent's favorite bands: Wolfmother kills. The den is open, step inside...
B000EULJLU|5.0|<br />This is an interesting musical experience from a band that has already pushed the musical envelope with 'Lateralus'. I must say that this is not quite what I expected from Tool and therein lies the magic of this album. It is really superb and just goes to show that we, as an audience, really don't know what to expect from this creative band. This is a sonic journey that really challenges and excites the listener. But it is also great rock music and I must say that with each listen, I become more enmeshed in what is a deftly spun musical web. The musicianship really is exceptionally good and each track is carefully crafted - this is the musical equivalent of a novel you just can't put down! Deep magic indeed - I predict that this album turns out to be a classic.  <br />
B000E97Y6K|3.0|When Peter Jackson announced that Jack Black would play the lead in King Kong I was absolutely mystified. Supposedly a funnyman, Black's schtick consists of raising his eyebrows and talking in an overly sarcastic manner. There's no material, just him being a jerk.  <br /> <br />He can't act. Period. For most of the movie he's an anachronism, 21st century Jack Black playing himself in a movie set during the Depression. When the ship's captain compares him to a cockroach Black's response sounds like a line from an SNL sketch, not from a character in a period movie. <br /> <br />His performance, for lack of a better word, distracts from what is one of the most astounding visual achievements in cinematic history. The computer generated Kong is totally realistic. The \\"love story\\" between Kong and Ann Darrow is sweet and believable. Naomi Watts is luminous and heartbreaking, quite a feat considering most of her performance was done in front of a bluescreen with no giant ape anywhere nearby. <br /> <br />The brontosaurus scene is astonishing for its sheer audacity. The idea of having them stampede and pile up is just plain crazy, but they pulled it off. <br /> <br />The T-rex scene is one of the great action sequences in history. Again, what audacity -- not one but three!  <br /> <br />The movie is a bit long, but that's a minor quibble. This film would be an unqualified masterpiece were it not for the woefully miscast Black.  <br /> <br />
B000EULJLU|4.0|I can't quite wrap my head around this album yet. It's very similar to Aenima and moreso Lateralus in technique and style, and yet it's very different in it's level of emotion and depth.    This is the most personal album by Tool to date. When Maynard sings \\"Give me my wings!\\" on \\"10,000 days (Wings pt. 2),\\" a song about his late mother Judith Marie, you can't help but feel his soul crying out. Maynard, largely considered agnostic, even eludes to a higher being on \\"Right in Two\\" with lines such as \\"Why did father give these humans free will/Now they're all confused.\\"    No longer are Tool singing about Saturn return and other intellectually centered material. While this makes the album more down to earth, it strips Tool of the aura of uncertainty and mystery that always attracted me to them.    This is also arguably Tool's most primal album. The opening riff to \\"Jambi\\" suggests a bare bones, stripped approach to song writing that permeates throughout the entire track and much of the album. On Rosetta Stoned, Maynard sings \\"[...]\\" like a primate just released from captivity.    The problem I'm having with 10,000 Days is that, while I do enjoy it, I don't get lost in it like I do with Aenima, Lateralus, or even Undertow. It doesn't take me to \\"another world,\\" for lack of a less cliche term. But maybe that will come with time.    And yet, the individual songs are excellent. \\"Right in Two\\" builds up to a dramatic crescendo, resulting in one of the best songs in Tool's canon. \\"The Pot,\\" another highlight, calls back to the days of \\"Opiate\\" with Maynard showcasing his true tenor voice in front of a groove-heavy rhythm section. The already mentioned \\"10,000 days\\" is extremely dramatic and dare I say...emotional.    Hence my confusion.    I've read many of the reviews, and many times I can't help but discredit half of what's being said. Many who loved their past efforts are saying the album is utter crap, which is probably a little drastic. However, I wouldn't consider thisa gigantic step forward for Tool - maybe a step to the right would be more appropriate.
B000EULJLU|5.0|Well once again the band has delivered. Just when I was starting to give up on the stale music out now, Tool enters back into the scene with an AMAZING BLOW YOUR MIND CD!!!!! They are one of a kind and a good example of what all music should sound like. My appreciation for music is because of bands like tool. It was a long but worth while wait. The cd case is unique and compliments the bands love for art!!!!!! Out of the 11 titles on the cd I could honestly say I like 10 out of the 11. Thanks tool for your dedication and love for music that we all get to enjoy and appreciate...... JOB WELL F***** DONE!!!!!!
B000EULJLU|5.0|I usually lurk in the \\"underground\\" as it were, largely ignoring the mainstream, but I always make an exception for the incredibly popular and revered Tool.  They have been blowing my mind for years with each succesive album. When a new one hits, its not a new release, its a f*cking EVENT.<br /><br />  That being said, I was suprised by all the negative pre-buzz surrounding this album. People were complaining it didn't \\"sound like Tool\\" and it was nothing but \\"boring filler\\". I could not disagree more. As many people have pointed out, each Tool release is distinct in its sound and scope. Opiate, Undertow, Anemia, and Lateralus all sound fairly different from each other. Sure there are similarities and a trademark \\"style\\".. they're all from the same band! Now with 10,000 Days, Tool again has something different and altogether brilliant. The opener Vicarious is classic Tool, complete with complex time signatures, cynical lyrics, and awesome intensity. From there, its track after track of great listening. The track that stands out to me is \\"Wings Part I and II\\". This one really long track is perhaps one of the most intense and powerful pieces of music ever produced in modern rock. No, you can't bang your head to it. There are no crushing riffs or pummeling drums. Just Maynard calmly paying homage to his dead mother over a brooding bass line and rolling thunder. The song slowly builds to an unbelievable climax that is gauranteed to raise the hairs on your neck and make you appreciate the sheer genuis of this song. Beautiful and chilling. My only gripe on this disc is Lipan Conjuring, just because it seems out of place. Of course, this is probably exactly what Tool wanted to do, so in that case... uh, good job! So in the end, yes, 10,000 Days sounds different from any Tool album that has come out, and I think thats a great thing. This is an awesome album for any Tool fan or music lover. Just give it a chance and it will give you back a LOT more.<br /><br />P.S. On a sidenote, the packaging is hands down the most awesome thing I've ever gotten \\"free\\" with an album. Really really cool. (And I'm not even high!)packaging is hands down the most awesome thing I've ever gotten \\"free\\" with an album. Really really cool. (And I'm not even high!)
B000AXSN5G|5.0|This is an excellent album with a lot of strong songs.  I was not disappointed with any of the tracks, because they're all \\"Neil Young.\\" <br /> <br />Before I bought this album, I have been buying some of the earlier Neil Young albums, most especially \\"After the Gold Rush.\\"  After being a fan in the 1960s and 1970s, now I hear him and say--wow!  This is a brilliant artist that I can really identify with!  In fact, this is my favorite guy!  I saw the Jonathan Demme movie \\"Heart of Gold\\" about Young's performance of Prairie Wind in Nashville, and it was great; loved to see the band in concert; bought the album.  The tracks I personally like best are \\"Far from Home\\" for being a rollicking song and \\"It's a Dream\\" for making me want to cry. <br /> <br />This led me to reflect on what it is that I like so much about Neil Young.  Before, I always liked him, but when \\"After the Gold Rush\\" exploded off the stereo into my consciousness several months ago after buying the old CD, his work has captivated me, much more so that before.  Why?  I'm 52 years old now, and I think there is such a thing as the \\"lonely bull\\" persona in which a guy feels on his own, in charge of his own life, which has good points (happy and fast-moving songs)and bad (makes for the sad songs).  Neil Young songs are prime examples of that.  Frank Sinatra had that appeal (although he's way before my time; my Dad loves him), which may account for why he was so popular.  Same for Tony Bennett, whom I really like.  Neil Young's songs, in 2006, put me in moods that I want to be in, and the core is his particular spirit, whatever that is.  You want to tap into it.  The emotional landscape there is attractive, whether happy or sad.  The voice, the spare arrangements, but most of all the writing take you there. <br /> <br />In terms of emotional power, to me, only John Lennon the solo artist is on a par with Neil Young.  Now, I'm the biggest Beatles fan in the world, really loved all of their stuff, and loved Lennon's solo work.  But Neil Young goes to some of the same places, and hits similar heights.  For example, Lennon's song \\"Mother\\" (I think that's it's name) also makes me want to cry and I almost can't listen to it.  Similar effect on me, although much mellower, for \\"It's a Dream\\" on Prairie Wind.  To me, that is emotional power.  Few artists have it. <br /> <br />Women often seem to wonder where men's emotions are.  I say, they are found in good music. <br /> <br />
B00001ODGR|5.0|I saw Styx in concert in 1981 during the original \\"Paradise Theater\\" tour. I was a high school student, and unimpressed with previous bands (Molly Hatchet and Heart) whose concerts I'd attended. <br /> <br />Styx really thrives in the arena; they put on a truly fantastic show! I've always wished I could see that 1981 concert again live -- I took some nice photos at the 1981 concert -- and this DVD really brought it all back. I watched this DVD over and over, with memories of 1981 reinforced by this fine 1996 performance. <br /> <br />This is what you get when you have talented muscians who understand they are on a stage, putting on a show for an audience; superbly executed music and a great performance.  If you've haven't discovered Styx yet, you may find this DVD to be the turning point for you. In fact, I'd recommend you buy this DVD before you buy any Styx vinyl or CDs. Styx is even more enjoyable in concert.  <br /> <br />They are one of those rare bands who belong on stage more, and in the studio less. As the Cheap Trick live version of \\"I want you to want me\\" showed that band to shine on stage, this DVD proves Styx's value as one of the original arena rock bands.  <br /> <br />My favorite moments from this DVD are too many to list. Frankly, Styx doesn't have select good \\"moments\\" on stage; the entire concert is a great moment. There are no flat spots. You don't get bored. <br /> <br />I was mesmerized watching Tommy Shaw make guitar playing seem like magic, and his angelic voice is undiminished by time; ditto for Dennis DeYoung's perfect voice and keyboard playing, Chuck's cozy presence with is bass guitar, James Young's high \\"hair-metal\\" energy, the new drummer's perfect playing and the band's comfortable and very dynamic stage chemistry with each other. <br /> <br />This concert leaves you feeling good.  <br /> <br />- john starr <br />
B000EHQ57Q|4.0|Another terrific surround-mix for a Moody Blues classic. I am only giving this one four stars, however, because of a couple (minor) shortcomings. The bass on this mix is decidedly weak, and I am not one who likes a lot of bass. As well, Justin Hayward's guitar solos are frequently buried in the mix. That's a shame because Justin hit a peak on this album, matched only by \\"Seventh Sojourn\\", in lyricism and relevance, with his guitar work. Otherwise, this latest iteration of \\"A Question of Balance\\" is wonderful.
B000EULJLU|5.0|Honestly, I have to say, if fans have been there from the beginning, and say they're disappointed with this album, then they really aren't true fans. Even though the CD is mostly a filler, it's great. If you actually listen, and use your mind, it'll bring you places. Everything these days is all about catchy songs you can sing to. This isn't about that, this is more about feeling something. Something you can actually believe in and experience.
B000EQ4G5K|4.0|Rihanna is still a fairly new artist, who's only been on the musci scene for about a year now, and this is her second album.  When Pon De Replay came out last summer, I absolutely fell in love with rihanna.  And when If It's lovin that you want came out, I was like wow!  I am gooing to go and buy the album, these songs are amazing!  As I listened to her first album, I was completely dissapointed.  Alot of the material on there was fillers, but it did have its good moments.  And now, that her second album is out I can't really say the same.  When I first heard SOS, I thought they were going to re-release the music of the sun, which I though would have been a dumb idea.  But then I noticed that she was making a second album, I was totally excited! and could not wait!  Now that it's here I will rate each track!<br /><br />SOS- Lead single off of the album, An amazing song, that everyone loves!  It's a great song to dance too, and just an overall fun song!  This song recently went from #34 to #1 on the charts, which I was very impressed with.  Great song!  One of my favorites on the album 10/10<br /><br />Kisses Don't Lie- I absolutely love this song!  It is my second favorite on the album!  It would make a great single, its a very different rockish carribean sound for rihanna, and would definately change up her style. 10/10<br /><br />Unfaithful- The third best song on the album!  I really had to let this song grow on me.  When I first heard this song, I thought she was oversinging and she sounded horrible, but it really does grow on you.  And now its the second single, and I wouldn't have chosen a better song! 10/10<br /><br />We ride- The best song on the album!  This definately needs to be the third single!  This song, has the coolest beat ever, and is extremely different for rihanna!  This would definately be a hit among fans, and non fans! 10/10<br /><br />Dem haters- This is another carribean sounding song, which is suprisingly very good.  The lyrics are very meaningful, and duwayne Husbands, who is featured in the song, has a very good voice, that makes the song even better, but it still doesnt come to parr with a few other songs on the album, but its very good nevertheless. 8/10<br /><br />Final Goodbye- This song is a very different sounding song for rihanna, and also for myself.  I havn't really heard this type of song before.  I guess it kind of sounds like a slow latino song, but its one of my favorites none of the less, the fourth best song on the album! 10/10<br /><br />Break it off- This is supposed to be the third single off the album that's supposed to be relased in July for the 1st single of sean pauls new album, and third off of rihannas.  This is a good song, but I think that this song shouldn't be a single.  But they are doing the two album single scenario, so I see how it works in both cases.  But there are much better songs on the album than this.  Good song nevertheless. 8/10<br /><br />Crazy little thing called love- Horrible! I am so mad, they put this filler track on the album, I skip it everytime!  I can't stand it at all.  The lyrics, the beat are all horrible! 0/10<br /><br />Selfish Girl- This is another carribean sounding song, that has the horns to go with it.  Very good song, also one of my favorites on the album. 9/10<br /><br />P.S.(I'm still not over your)- Great song, great lyrics!  I love this song alot, it is definately single material. 10/10<br /><br />A girl like me- Sounds very similar to final goodbye.  It's a very good song, and has good lyrics, and its very catchy! 9/10<br /><br />Million Miles Away- This song ties with the best song!  I abslutely love this song!  Very meaningful!  I think this song should have been chosen over unfaithful.  This song is just pure vocal heaven, and its just awesome!  Words can't explain how good this song is! 10/10<br /><br />If it's loving that you want(remix)- Not needed, at all.  Doesn't even compare to the orginal.  I'm going to start with a ten and take off a point for ythe change of beat, a point for not re-recording the song, and a a point for the cheesy rap parts. So 7/10<br /><br />111/130=85% which is a B rating.  Like I said this is a step-up from rihannas last album, which would have gotten a (c- or D) Rating from me.<br /><br />Top 5(really 6):<br /><br />We ride/Million Miles away<br /><br />Kisses Don't lie<br /><br />Unfaithful<br /><br />Final Goodbye<br /><br />SOSing to start with a ten and take off a point for ythe change of beat, a point for not re-recording the song, and a a point for the cheesy rap parts.

6305127638|5.0|I have often said, not only is this movie good as a Star Trek film, it's just a good movie, period.  Undoubtedly the best Star Trek film to date.<br /><br />Patrick Stewart, as usual, does an excellent job.  I love his acting style, his passion for his role is unmatched.<br /><br />The interraction between the crew.. it is not a stretch of the imagination to believe that these people know and care for one another.  The subtle nuances of expression, most especially with Riker, Data, Picard, and Worf, add believabilty and humanity to their acting.<br /><br />Lilly, excellent character development and a wonderful performance.<br /><br />And of course the plot and action.  No holes, not a dull moment nor any excess/uneeded details.<br /><br />In times likes these, I find myself gravitating towards the Star Trek universe.  This movie certainly delivers the feeling that, if one man could have such a marvelous and hopeful vision for the future and could see the potential inherent in humankind, perhaps it is not impossible that those in power today could also see it and strive for it.
0743424425|5.0|I read this many years ago but still vividly remember a lot of it because of the great story. This really is one of King's best if not THE best. Just fantastic!!  <br /> <br />The setting, the Overlook Hotel, an old hotel/resort abandoned for the winter, is perfect for what King does, giving people the creeps. He slowly builds the suspense as Jack, the main character, slowly goes crazy and we as the readers get to watch this unfold. I was never quite sure whether all that Jack sees is really happening, as in ghostly voices, or just his slowly eroding mind losing its grip.  <br /> <br />As the story continues, King draws it out just enough to keep the pace moving while you wait for the other shoe to drop on this unsuspecting caretaker family. I dont want to give away too much of the story but suffice it to say that every page has the potential to make you clench up just a little more and a little more.  <br /> <br />The background story of the Overlook is storytelling at its best, creepy and disturbing. The characters are well done, which is typical for King, and the ending was great. Overall I consider one of the best examples of horror-writing that I'ver read. Recommended for anyone who likes disturbing, provocative fiction written by a master. <br /> <br />
B000EULJLU|5.0|This album was not what I expected but I still loved it.Deeper and more soulfull than what fans are used to.What I like about tool is they make each album unique while still making a Tool album.This album is great.I love the artwork and the 3D specs.A good reason not to download off the net and buy the album.Tool still is the best heavy band in the industry.
B000ETQRCM|5.0|I could hardly wait to listen to this record. As a long time Pearl Jam fan (and one who loves every record), this record was a breath of fresh air. Although I loved the quietness and subtle beauty of Binaural and Riot Act, this record has brought PJ back to some of their roots. It's more hard rocking. It's more angry. And it's awesome.  <br /> <br />The lyrics? Amazing as usual. And the guitars kick ass. <br /> <br />The first time I listened to it, I was a bit confused. I think I was prepared to hear that more reserved kind of music that I had become accustomed to hearing from Pearl Jam in the past years. But after a second listen, and a third, and a fourth... I know this album will be blasted from my car stereo, windows down, for the entirety of the summer. <br /> <br />And though I rarely listen to radio anymore, it's nice to turn it on every so often and hear Pearl Jam.  <br /> <br />Buy this album. It's great.
B000ETQRCM|5.0|...about the intensity of emotion and devotion that Pearl Jam still elicits. <br /> <br />I grabbed the single - WWS and Unemployable - as soon as it came out, and I got a pre-release copy of the album about two weeks ago.  As many others have said, you have to listen to this album a few times.  Like all the best music, it comes at you from oblique angles.  It's more nuanced, and less \\"catchy\\", than some of PJ's early work.  I felt the same way about \\"Yield\\", and that album has become one of my all-time favorites. <br /> <br />I guess I'm not your typical PJ fan.  I was only vaguely familiar with their music until four or five years ago.  My sons and their friends would ocassionally jam and when they'd play a PJ tune I'd ask \\"who is that, who did that tune?\\"  It wasn't until about 18 months ago that I finally decided to really check them out.  Yield was the first PJ album to grab me, largely on the strength of \\"In Hiding\\" and \\"Faithful.\\"  I was going through a very difficult time in my life - very alienated - and \\"In Hiding\\" just struck me like a lightning bolt.  Songs about alienation are a rock staple, but I still maintain that \\"In Hiding\\" is the greatest song about alienation ever recorded. <br /> <br />I quickly acquired every PJ album available and started seriously evaluating them.  Oddly, \\"Ten\\" - which so many PJ fans (including my sons) revere and consider their best - didn't really grab me.  There are many good tunes on the album but I didn't like the production.  The sound was somehow muted; it didn't have the sonic vibrancy I'd heard on Yield or No Code.  While many of the tunes on Ten are among my favorites I almost always listen to live versions of them. <br /> <br />What's extraordinary about these guys is that songs that didn't grab you the first five or six times you heard them will then start growing on you.  It's happening to me all over again with this album.  Songs like \\"Gone\\" and \\"Unemployable\\" immediately appealed to me, but it's taken numerouslistenings for songs like \\"Army Reserve\\", \\"Severed Hand\\" and \\"Come Back\\" to make a strong impression.  I'm gonna give away my age here, but I've got to say that it was the same way with a lot of the best Beatles and Stones stuff.  They both did catchy stuff, up-beat rockers that grabbed you right away, and also stuff that was somehow more complex and took time to make sense aurally. <br /> <br />For those of you that love this album, I'm with ya - this is a keeper. For those of you that don't, don't give up on it yet.  Give it a few more listens.  For those of you waiting for \\"Ten\\" again, it just may be that \\"Ten\\" was the right album, at the right time for you, at the right stage of your life, and the music and your sensibilities just won't come together like that with this album. <br /> <br />Whatever you want to say, you have to give Eddie and Mike and Stone and Jeff and Matt credit for still going pretty strong after 15 years.  The Beatles were over by then, and the Stones, Who and Zeppelin were in steep decline by the time they'd been around this long.  For my money U2 has also grown pretty soft in recent years - they can still occasionally rock, but there's too much mushy Bono material.  But after 15 years Eddie and the boys can still pin your ears back with rock 'n roll that hits you right in the gut.  It's pretty amazing. <br /> <br />Get the album. <br /> <br />P.S.  The politics are great, too.  Bush is a warmongering jerk, and PJ calls him out.

B000EULJLU|4.0|It took a few listens through, but I grew to really enjoy this album.  I can't really say the same as the bizarre cd packaging it came in, which is unergonomically strange even for Tool, but at least the music on the album is good. Although it isn't as good as its' predecessors--\\"Aenima\\" and \\"Lateralus,\\" the album is very different and unique, iconoclastic if you must, and I would also argue that it is hard to follow such landmark albums.  Yes, there are a handful of quote, \\"filler songs,\\" but it is a solid album, nonetheless.
1400032717|5.0|This book is clever and touching.  It is interesting to see the world through the eyes of this \\"special\\" kid.
B000EULJLU|5.0|This album is progressive, yet again TOOL changes sounds and creates a new atmosphere moving even further away from the angst of their youth and closer to enlightenment. I have noticed a lot of simple minded so-called fans are finding this disappointing.<br /><br />Sadly for true rabid TOOL fans, the words and emotions shared by the band on this album may never be topped again. We can only pray. There message is still a simple one, think for yourself, question authority. Stop being a bovine mindlessly wasting your life and running toward the slaughter.<br /><br />There is also a lot of dedication to Judith Marie within these lyrics which some of us can easily apply to our own lives and love of others..

B000EULJLU|1.0|Tool. A band that describes the very backbone of musical creativity and artistic expression. Till now that is.  <br />10,000 days could be described as a demo or a geographical background of pure nothingness. Where is the message? Where are the melodies, the hooks, the aggression the climaxes? Could it be that this whole disk is a subliminal message that only true \\"tool\\" fans can understand. Here's my membership card and please throw it away. Theres no message and there isn't anything worth listening to either. Maynard is so self-N-\\"dull\\"-gent on this disk and it is a shame that the other 3 musicians are even a part of this band. Just write some music with character or at least put forth some effort. This disk sucks. You wont listen to it tomorrow. You may even take it back because you'll think you bought the wrong disk. It sounds nothing like what you would expect or want to hear. Change the bands name to \\"trash\\".

B000ETQRCM|5.0|I must say that over the past few months I became a Pearl Jam fan. I started out with Ten and for some reason I was telling myself don't go any further that Ten, Pearl Jam just kind of wandered off. But around Christmas I said.. Hell why not just buy 'Rearviewmirror' their greatest hits and see what they really sound like. Well... I became an immediate fan and hoped that maybe some new material would come out sometime soon. My optimism was perhaps a little low since there last album was in 2002 and I thought maybe they were slowing things down a bit. So after strolling on Wikipedia.org, I found out Pearl Jam would be releasing a NEW album by the spring of 2006. I went nuts, I couldn't believe they were going to come out with another album. I counted the days up until this past Tuesday (May 2nd) and raced into Best Buy and bought that and Tool's 10,000 Days. My God... Pearl Jam's self-titled album is fantastic. Every track is memorable almost like every Pearl Jam song. Truly they are a band committed to their fans. With 13 tracks, they did a fine job of writing and coming up with some phenomenal material. An album to remember for years to come.

B000B8QEYC|5.0|Enya's music has always been uniquely Enya, not just Celtic or Classical or New Age, but just simply Enya. Though some consider her to be repititve or predictable, to me, she is just simply revisting old themes, a practice very notable in the Brennan family, as Clannad and Moya Brennan have also frequently revisted themes and sounds in their music. Roma Ryan's lyrics are very imaginative and invoke the power of creativty. There is a strong Celtic quality with songs like \\"Less than a Pearl\\", \\"The River Sings\\", and \\"Long Long Journey\\". \\"Long Long Journey\\" creates the image of the Irish imigrating to America with it's hymnal/folk song quality. There's even a Celtic ballad quality with \\"If I could be where you are\\" and \\"A Moment Lost\\". Songs like \\"It's In the Rain\\" and \\"Someone Said Goodbye\\" even have a bit of a pop quality. Roma's lyrics once again ask life questions like in \\"Amarantine\\". The beauty of \\"Amarantine\\" really floats in the air witht he innocence of Enya's voice and the smoothness of the strings. Roma's words tell great stories and use symbolism, creating what the listener can emotionally relate to. \\"Sumiregusa\\" is a world of enchantment on its own, creating a beautiful image of nature through the Japanese prose. Perhaps the most amazing song of all is \\"Water Shows the Hidden Heart\\" when it comes down to Enya's vocal variety, style, melody and harmony, and the power of the story in the lyrics. Once again, her multi-vocal methods create beautiful choral sounds. The sci-fi story behind Roma's Loxian lyrics certainly transports the listener into one's own magical world. \\"Drifting\\" provides a nice peaceful interlude. My only criticism would be that I think the album doesn't have the same high quality as her albums from pre-Paint the Sky with Stars, which I also felt with A Day Without Rain, but nonetheless, a lot of the same power remains. Just as with her previous albums, the songs on Amarantine sound like music that you've heard before on a dream, another power that I am convinced runs in the great Brennan family. Amarantine is still a five-star-ranking quality album, which I am convinced Enya will always be.

B00004VVND|5.0|special effects have come along way from 1974 when westworld first came out,but this little gem still hangs head and shoulders above most sci-fi entertainment. <br />      welcome to delos,vacation spot of the future,where you can have a once and a lifetime fantasy come true. you may choose westworld,romanworld,and meadevilworld! you can,for $1000.00 a day(1974 prices) you can live out your most secert fantisies.it's all set up to please you and you can't get hurt. of course if that were true then we have no movie. soon after the latest batch of people get to the park,the robots begin to have breakdowns,like a virus(i still remember the reviews calling the idea of computers getting viruses as \\"to far out there,no one will believe it\\" wonder if they still think so). james brolin and richard benjemin are two friends enjoying westworld when the whole park goes on the blink and the robots start to kill thr guest. <br />  the final chase(with evil robot yul brynner,still dressed as chris from his stint in the maganfict seven cloths)is very thrilling and the whole movie has the feel of a park ride gone bad. a very fun movie.
B000EHSVOG|5.0|Irwin Allen had already one hit disaster epic under his belt (1972's \\"The Poseidon Adventure\\"), and he followed that up with 1974's \\"The Towering Inferno\\", which I thought was an even better movie. \\"The Towering Inferno\\" is about the tallest skyscraper in the world that starts burning out of control after bad wiring causes a flare-up in a storage room. I was scared to death when I watched this film the first couple of times on TV when I was a kid. It doesn't scare me today, but now I find the movie exciting, suspenseful, and mind-boggling. Like \\"The Poseidon Adventure\\", Allen got a big name cast to participate in the film. Paul Newman, Steve McQueen, William Holden, Faye Dunaway, Fred Astaire, Jennifer Jones, Robert Wagner, Robert Vaughn, Richard Chamberlain, Susan Blakely, and O.J. Simpson star, with early film appearances by Dabney Coleman (of \\"9 to 5\\" and TV's \\"Buffalo Bill\\") and Susan Flannery (Emmy winning star of the soap opera \\"The Bold and the Beautiful\\"). Big time actors, but like most disaster movies, the big star here is the special effects. Very impressive. The cinematography and editing (which won Oscars) play a big part in the film as well. The only thing that can be considered negative about \\"The Towering Inferno\\" is the script. Like all of Irwin Allen's disaster films (as well as disaster films not produced by Allen), this one has its share of idiotic dialogue. Usually a movie that has this element bothers me like it did in the disaster films of the late '70s. But I didn't let that bother me with this film (same goes for \\"The Poseidon Adventure\\"). The action scenes and special effects are so spectacular, along with some good performances (particularly by Astaire and Jones), that it makes \\"The Towering Inferno\\" a great suspense thriller. <br />
B000EULJLU|1.0|You know- waiting for Tool albums to come out is like waiting for Heley's commet to make an appearance. This album is OK- but for the wait- its kinda bad. If you want it- get it- who cares- but this album is not that great- I listened to it twice- and never again. Some cool guitar parts- thats all- a lot of filler- and some nasty songs spread throughout. Yuck.
B000EULJLU|5.0|This is by far the best Tool album ever. I can agree with a previous person stating it was similar to Pink Floyd. I can see that especially with the Pink Floyd album \\"Wish you were here\\" and the song \\"Shine on you crazy diamond\\".  I've read a lot of people confused with lipan conjuration. If you pay attention you will get what is going on. They are performing a lipan-apache conjuration (probably for a vision) and then the next song \\"Lost Keys\\" If you listen to what is being said the doc is asking what happened then in \\"Rossetta Stoned\\" He proceedes to tell him what happened during the conjuration. Go back and listen to it.
B000EHRVP6|4.0|2 Americans and an Icelander are in Amsterdam having a good time. Then this guy  tells them about hot chicks, who will do anything, in eastern europe. They then go their and start to party with hot chicks. Then the Icelandic guy disappears and then one of the Americans. You find out that people in this town capture tourists take them to an old factory and rich people come their and pay to kill them. The other American gets caught but escapes and rescues a woman he met earlier and they both try to escape the town who all seem to know about what's going on.       The first half of the movie has nudity and it doesn't start to get gory until the second half. You see people getting sliced up, shot, runover and you even get to see some guys getting their heads smashed in by rocks, which is something that is usually left to the imagination.          There were many mistakes made like when one of the Americans is speaking German in Amsterdam and they are speaking it back to them when they actually speak Dutch there. But on the other hand German is a very popular language in Europe. Also the country that they go to is pretty run down and they watch really old T.V.'s and drive really old cars and the characters are speaking a different language than is actally spoken there. Those mistakes don't bother me because it's a movie but it should be cleared up on a comantary or something so that people don't get the wrong impression about Europe.      The only thing that I thought was scary was that there probably are places like this wheter in Eastern Europe or America or anywhere else. Where people will pay to kill someone.     What little gore they did show was okay looking except for a guy who gets his fingers chopped off because you could easily tell that his hand was fake. I liked how the torture place resembled the prostitute place in the begining in that you have all these rooms lined up where people pay to do things. I also liked when the American started to kill some of his captors to escape but then he kills some others for revenge without a second thought which he probaly wouldn't have done before this ordeal. One problem is the ending because it left me wondering what he was going to do when he got home like does he go to the cops and do the bad guys get caught?
0553213105|5.0|Reading this book is like taking a sailboat ride to the world's best locations: exciting, smooth, tumultuous, but all in all a fantatic ride.  Austen delightfully teases you in your role as omnicient reader, leaving you tantalized by the characters in all of their plots and sub-plots.  You want to reach into the book and tell the characters you know the solutions to all their problems.  You cheer the characters on through their pleasures and foibles.  The language is as smooth as silk and as alluring as diamonds.
B000EULJLU|3.0|What marked Tool's previous two releases is distinctly missing here...a quantum leap forward.  Aenima was so great that when Lateralus came out I didn't like it and put it away for over a year!  After I dusted it off and finally heard it for what it was it became my favorite Tool cd.  Parabola/Ticks & Leeches/Lateralus is the pinnacle of Tool's recording career. <br /> <br />10,000 days does not evoke that same response.  I agree with a previous poster that at times certain riffs seem reminiscent of Aenima and Lateralus.  Almost gone is the ultra-aggressiveness that once defined Undertow, connected Aenima, and highlighted Lateralus.  However, the aggression has been replaced with hypnotic auras rather than lyrical melodies.  Lateralus walked the fine line of aggression and melody perfectly.  10,000 days seems to meander more often than not.  Especially, during the long songs. <br /> <br />Hopefully, we won't have to wait another 5 years to spark up the discussion again.
B00005JOFQ|5.0|I was always wondering what these guys were doing in the wilderness without a woman at hand. The fresh air must have been very stimulating. I have never expected it to be that romantic though.  In his latest masterpiece Ang Lee takes us to a place, where no one ever dared to go before: Brokeback Mountain. Here the place where Ennis and Jack's love is born. A love so clear and beautiful, so endless and eternal like the sky at the beginning of the movie.     Brokeback shows us the romantic side of the Wild West. It's a great American story that had to be told and it's a master class in subtle direction. It's a triumph for Ang Lee and Heath Ledger and most of all it is one of the best Love Stories ever!    There are no words in no language I know that could describe the beauty of this movie.
B000ETQRCM|5.0|Before I begin, here's a thought, perhaps Grandma Pearl's jam is made from avocados. Just a thought... NOW, HERE WE GO... When I first heard this disc, I felt confused. The first four tracks are so ANGRY and INCENDIARY. What kind of music is this?! Where's the corporate-y, jangly, American Idol-y, ear candy rock we've all been subjected to the past few years?  <br /> <br />Then, I was like, whoa, the first four tracks are so REFRESHING, too. Like a punch to the face first thing in the morning! Where's the repetitve, brainless sludge of all those carbon-copy Creed-bands I hear on corporate radio? <br /> <br />Oh, wait, it's a new PEARL JAM album. Duh. OK, well, then, where's the uninspired, uneven mess I'd grown accustomed to since Binaural and (ugh) Riot Act? Well... It's gone. Blown up. UTTERLY DESTROYED. This album is IMMEDIATE, IN YOUR FACE and demands to be TURNED UP. (Actually, I've heard Eddie Vedder is a huge Sleater-Kinney fan (they've actually performed together) and I can hear S-K's influence here (S-K's last album, The Woods, is a similar in punch-to-your-face masterpiece). BUT, I digress...) <br /> <br />SO, as I settle in with my avocado, try to sort out this confusion, I realize. OH, wait a minute, this is ROCK and ROLL. This is that stuff I fell in love with back in my youth, the stuff like U2, REM, Led Zep, The Who, AC/DC, Neil Young... YES! That's what this is! ROCK AND ROLL! That's what \\"PEARL JAM\\" is! It's tasty licks, riffs, melodies and howling vocals. It's provocative lyrics that make me THINK. Wow! It's... it's freakin' rock and roll! It didn't die! I get it!  <br /> <br />NOW, just go buy this album, crank it up, enjoy something pure, instant and unmistakably powerful. This is why they make big speakers. The avocado album will proudly sit on your musical top shelf for the rest of your days. My favorite tracks? Well, they're all pretty good, but Unemployable is SOLID, Marker in  the Sand, Life Wasted, Comatose, Gone, Come Back, Inside Job, World Wide Suicide (what a ballsy title by the way), on and on, since when were there this many great tracks on ANY album?  <br /> <br />As far as comparisons go, I feel this is their most COMPLETE album. Sure, I loved Yield, No Code, Vitalogy, (the Bugs song was AWFUL though), VS. and OF COURSE! TEN (I really pity the folks that can't get beyond TEN). But, the avocado album is, from start to finish, A COMPLETE MASTERPIECE. The largest and most refreshingly \\"immediate\\" addition to PJ's vast catalog of great tunes. Pearl Jam's best album. Period. Eddie and the boys weren't lying when they said it. <br /> <br />From the opening assault of Life Wasted to the stunning, heart-breaking piano on Inside Job, dare I say, it's ONE OF THE GREATEST ROCK AND ROLL ALBUMS OF ALL TIME. Grammys all around. Thanks guys!
B000EULJLU|5.0|I personally think that this album is a step forward for the band.  I've seen some negative reviews and, barring those that are really just disguises for bashing Tool and/or their fans, I think some fans really want more of the past Tool cd's.  I'm not bothered that this album is not a re-release of ?nima.  If that were the case, there'd be more complaints of \\"more of the same\\".  You can't please everyone.  So far, I can't stop listening to this one and the more I listen, the more I want to keep listening.  The vocals are a bit different among other things, but at the same time, nothing is really \\"out of flavor\\" compared to Tool's prior work.  You'll still be amazed and the instrumental and lyrical quality. <br /> <br />The only complaint that I've seen and won't deny is that there is a little more filler than I like.  However, even if you remove all of that, you still have as much real playing time as most other albums released today.
B000EULJLU|1.0|This cd was way over-rated and too built-up for what it is.  True, the SONGS on there are awesome but there are only about 4 out of 11.  The rest are just long, boring intros and some of them are intros to intros.  For the time they had off, they should have put out a better quality cd than this!
B000EULJLU|5.0|this album here reminds me exactly of opiate. if i could give it 10 stars i would. the cd packaging was very creative as well, i like the 3d like glasses that came on the package to make the artwork look like its popping out right at ya. when i come with a band, i want to package an album like that!!! the songs all fit in the order given and its somewhat lighter than the last releases, like i said its exactly like opiate. how i rank the tool albums are, opiate being number one, the new cd 10,000 days number 2, aenema number three, undertow number four, laturalus number 5. saliva is bad ass too, but thats more of a b sides and rarities type album with a bad ass music video collection on dvd. so this is more of a 10 star album than five, but oh well, it will have to do. tool did it again folks, they never will change and the changes they do make, dont make a difference at all, cause what your listening to is still tool my friends!!!!!!! BUY THIS ALBUM. STEALING IS BAD!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B00005OWEG|5.0|I like both the original and the Redux version, the French plantation scene included. I guess the first thing to point out is that Redux is not the original. It is extra. Therefore, in my case at least, I watched the Redux version, haivng already watched the original several times. And I have now watched the Redux version in whole and in part on many occasions. Crucially, I view the orginal and the Redux as different experiences.<br /><br />If we do it this way, the dinner scene is quite good. Where is the Chief? Look at how Lance behaves like an animal at dinner. How Chef's request to talk to the plantation's chef is thrwn back in his face? There is some great camera work at the table: the family staying together (all the empty chairs signifying fatalities), the accordion player living in the past of Dien Bien Phu and the French political chit chat. Then of course there is the lady: strong drugs and string booze to bolster her up, and the strangely erotic bedroom scene. Although the French make many valid points, they too are a galaxy away from reality. The old guy saying we al have ot live together in peace (in hte middle of a major war), the others arguing over French poliitcs and the way they all dress up fro dinner, just like in the good old days. If all this is looked on as an extra, as a second movie, it is good.<br /><br />I also think Kilgore is also fleshed out nicely a little more, though this might be just increased familiarity with the movie. I also like Kurtz reading the news to Willard with all the kids looking on. It looks like Uncle Kurtz reading a fairy story. Of course, war is not a fairy story for little kids and there are vignettes aplenty in Redux that will linger for ages.

0064409422|5.0|The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe   <br />  <br /> <br />Reviewed by: Jordan  <br /> <br />Grades 3-7/ Ages 7-13  <br /> <br />Fantasy Fiction  <br /> <br />Series: The Chronicles of Narnia  <br /> <br />Book #1   <br /> <br /> <br /> Four children Lucy, Edmund, Susan, and Peter live in far away London. Lucy is the youngest, Edmond is the 2nd youngest, Susan is the 2nd oldest, and Peter is the oldest. Their mother sent them on a train to their Uncle's, the Professor, house, because World War ll was happening around their hometown London, England.   <br />  <br /> While the four children were playing hide-n-seek at their uncle's house Lucy found a magical land called Narnia in the Professor's wardrobe. When Lucy comes back from Narnia unfortunately time hasn't changed. Lucy tells Peter, Susan, and Edmund about the wardrobe but they do not believe her. After that Edmund finds Narnia and meets The White Witch. The White Witch calls herself the Queen of Narnia but she really isn't.  <br />  <br /> When Edmund met the witch she gave Edmund Turkish Delight and told Edmund to bring his siblings. The next day Lucy, Edmund, Susan, and Peter are playing baseball and Edmund breaks the Professor's window. So they run into the wardrobe and fall into Narnia. The white witch captures Edmund, and then threw him in a cage. Lucy, Susan, and Peter have to go on a journey so they can free Edmund and defeat the White Witch with Aslan and his army by their side. Do they free Edmund? Do they defeat The White Witch? Highly Recommended   <br /> <br /> Read the other six books from the series of The Chronicles of Narnia.  <br />Book #2: The Magician's Nephew  <br />Book #3: The Horse and His Boy  <br />Book #4: Prince Caspian  <br />Book #5: The Voyage of the Dawn Treader  <br />Book #6: The Silver Chair  <br />Book #7: The Last Battle
B000EULJLU|4.0|May 2nd saw the release of two great metal records, 10,000 days and Ministrys Rio Grande Blood.  Both records are quite different but are incredible releases nonetheless.  Ministrys is straight and to the point thrash metal and 10,000 days is more abstract and will probably take multiple listens to fully appreciate.  Im not sure how much I will like this one in comparison to my two favorites Aenimia and Lateralus but I'm by no means disappointed in this one.  There are some great songs such as Vicarious, The Pot, Rosetta Stoned, and Wings For Marie.  A lot of the other songs are slow instrumentals or a nurse and doctor talking about a patient in the background before the bizarre Rosetta Stoned starts.  If you're disappointed in this one maybe you should get Rio Grande Blood by Ministry.  It's instant gratification and just a plain fun record.  This Tool album will probably take awhile to digest.
B00003CWN3|4.0|i was very surprised at how much i enjoyed this movie. i expected a piece of agitprop, but instead saw a balanced view of both the flaws and strengths of brandon teena. hilary swank was wonderful, and she makes as hot a teenage boi as any actress since the golden era of jodie & kristy in the late 70s. <br />
B000EULJLU|5.0|To get the full extent of this album you MUST listen with an open mind, putting yourself in a distraction free sense. This has to be one of the best if not the best album ever produced. The lyrics are very well thought through and have alot of meaning if you really listen. If you listen to this album with expectations for it to live up to other Tool CD's you probably will be disappointed. The music is thick and very well instremented. Everything is very harmonic and flows well together.  <br /> <br />My favorite song on the CD is \\"Right In Two\\" if you really listen to the words you will understand what Maynard is trying to get accross. It is almost an extension of Parabola. \\"Father why did you give these people free will, now they are all confused. Donkey's talk and monkey's know that Eden has enough to go around.\\" In my opinion I think this song is about pre-existance, peace with all existance, Spirits watching us through the veil \\"confused and amused\\" Then is goes on to show how humans progressed with free agency, given thumbs \\"to make clubs and beat each other down.\\"  <br /> <br />Rosetta Stoned does have guitar riffs that are very similar to other Tool works. I think Tool did that on purpose. I don't think they are having to rehash their old art. I think they are trying to tie their albums together to make a whole collective experience.  <br /> <br />Tool has grown and matured and if people can not see that or respect it then they aren't true music enthusiasts. You have to really appreciate music and the art of it to really get what Tool is trying to get across. If you aren't up to the challenge then don't buy the album. <br /> <br />The whole album does tell a story, every song does fit together you just have to listen with an open mind to get it. If you don't you never will. <br /> <br />And to all the haters out there:  I'd like to see you make an album that wasn't all sugar-pop and make it better than this.
B000EULJLU|5.0|Looking at the variety of comments on this page, it is obvious there are some who are very dissapointed. But nearly every single one of these comments are just reduced to: \\"The Tool I thought I knew wouldn't make an album like this\\" <br />I think it is because Tool as a band endear themselves very personally to each listener, more so than any other band perhaps. Another criticism is that 10,000 Days contains filler. I personally don't see much of it and what little there is can equated to most previous albums. One person claimed to feel that this had similar riffs to earlier albums, which I can agree with, but isn't really much of a problem. <br />To get on with talking about MY opinion then, it is this: I have listened to all Tool's albums in the past, Aenima coming out as my favourite. Then 10,000 Days comes out. I don't just feel this is the best Tool album, but go even further to say it is the best album I have ever heard. I'm no musical rookie either, I listen to anything from John Coltrane to Nile to Puccini. I hope I can say the same about 10,000 Days in about, well, 10,000 Days worth of repeat listens. For now, every track has a purpose and it is brilliant.
B00006ADGP|3.0|the history is only a background in this film casting sophia loren & marcello mastroianni as a depressed middle aged housewife and a depressed middle aged gay man thrown together in rome on the day when hitler pays an official state visit to mussolini. this is a great movie, but i cant recommend it to anyone who did not see it in its theatrical release. why? because this dvd is of a horrid print dubbed into english! no actor of such import has been as badly served in the dvd market as has sophia loren, several of whose greatest movies (\\"two women\\", \\"yesterday today & tomorrow\\", \\"el cid\\", this) are available only on dreadful transfers. PLEASE somebody get decent transfers made; \\"a special day\\" deserves to get 5 stars, but not til its viewable. <br />
B000BTJCRM|4.0|Let's face it new music hasn't been the best for ages. And this is a good album. Listening to it you'll hear a sound that I can describe as Tony Iommi style playing with Robert Plant style vocals. A nice combination, and the album has enough original elements that classic rock fans will be able to listen to it without saying \\"Hey this is just like ______, What's so great here?\\"<br /><br />Thanks to the advent of the internet you can preview this album at myspace.com/wolfmother and just decide for your self.
B00005JOE8|5.0|Ok, first things first: Left-Wing? C'mon!! I LOVED the movie and I do NOT consider myself Left-Winged at all. I'm a strong supporter of Capitalism but I despise the idea of a totalitarian government that harms the economy, deteriorates the business environment and sinks the stock market.    The British Government (in the movie) is deceiving and abusing its people and I couldn't help but feeling sympathy for V and his ideology.    Politics aside, the plot is interesting and extremely thought-provoking.    I didn't realize it was an adaptation of a comic until recently, so I cannot comment on that subject. Actually, I am not a big fan of comics and if I had known about the comic there's a chance I would have skipped this movie. It would have been a terrible mistake if you ask me.    If you are not a fan of comics either and you are lucky enough to be reading this, please forget about the comic thingy and enjoy the movie for what it is.     As a final word, the fact that this movie is getting either 4/5 stars or 1 star in most of the reviews is proof enough that it will not leave you indifferent and that it's definitely worth watching.
B000EULJLU|1.0|This album was the biggest waste of 10 dollars in the world!!! You would be better off burning 10 bucs than buying this horrible album.  Download the songs before you buy.
B000EULJLU|5.0|Simply great... don't really know what to say.  I hear angry undertones of their early work in Undertow, epicness of Aenima, surrealness of Lateralus... its the best of everything. <br /> <br />What a groove in \\"The Pot\\"... my god... crank it up as you race your car down the highway!  Enjoy!
B0000027D5|5.0|\\"Lotus\\" captures the Santana band at the peak of its jazz fusion \\"Caravanserai\\" era.  I have recordings of several other live Santana performances and this one tops them all.  The musicians, led by Carlos Santana's blazing guitar, are superb, which is a good thing since most of the cuts on this 2 CD set are instrumentals!  I haven't noticed any problems with the sound, despite what some other reviewers have noted.  The poster which accompanied the original Japanese LP album has been shrunk down to CD size thereby rendering it almost impossible to read the liner notes.  The only bad thing I can say about this set is the boring extended drum solo at the beginning of the second CD but hey, this was the 70's.  This is a \\"must have\\" album for Santana fans.
B0007LXPBI|5.0|As a 40's single male I just sort of stumbled into this movie on TV and it probably took about 5 minutes to be enchanted. Disney - re-make, yada yada...I had perhaps the lowest expectations possible given my profile. <br /> <br />But, all I can say is that if you want a feel good movie to watch when you are a bit down this is the best. It is worth mentioning that I have a plasma and the high definition really helps make this particular movie shine.  <br /> <br />I find it interesting to read other reviews that compares this 90's version with the older one. Perhaps I am \\"California\\" politically correct, but many of my objections regarding the original including good ol Vicki slapping Ms. Mills were softened immeasurably in the remake. Perhaps that's just progress, let's hope so.  <br /> <br />Anyway, my special appreciation goes to Lindsay Lohan who was so good in this film that we can all just hope she approaches this same combination of charm and appeal as an adult movie star.  I also thought that Elaine Hendrix had a stand out performance - just the right amount of foil to the twins.
B000EULJLU|2.0|I absolutely loved Lateralus and Aenema.  What this album is missing that those ones had was DYNAMICS.  Atmospheric, brooding sections would build into propelling grooves, and explode into these bombastic, \\"in your face\\" sections that would rock you sideways.  You really got a sense of development in the songs.    That's all here, but it's all been spoiled in the post-production.  The entire thing is such a flat, boring sound.  I'm listening to the first track, Vicarious, thinking, \\"Man, this section could rock my face off.\\"  The guitar is was too loud, the vocals are too soft.  Somebody asks \\"Where are Danny Carry's balls?\\"  If you listen really hard, his playing is just as great, you can just barely HEAR it!  It could have been SO GOOD!  I don't know who produced and/or mixed the album, but in an effort to go for a more \\"mainstream\\" sound in the production, they've spoiled all the peaks and valleys that make Tool such a good band.  Whoever it was, shame on them!
B000EULJLU|4.0|I gotta laugh at all the wannabe critics on here.. \\"Riveting!\\", \\"Triumphant!\\", \\"Musical Bliss!\\".. Give me a break! <br /> <br />All and all this is a good album.. Not great. And I doubt they were working on this for the last five years.. Come on, a little common sense goes a long way. A lot of this album sounds like Lateralus in disguise. Same old Tool riffs. I wouldn't be surprised if they did some recycling.
0670034711|3.0|I usually enjoy memoirs or travel but struggled through this one.  I think its because she has so much privilege yet often fails to see it.  Not everyone has the luxury of spending three months each in Italy, India and Indonesia just to \\"find\\" themselves.   <br /> <br />Its not my cup of tea but is an interesting look at how one woman lost nearly everything she believed essential and renewed her self-esteem and confidence.   <br /> <br />If you're interested in the travel aspect I would stear away since it doesn't cover much about the three countries.
B00000099Y|5.0|First things first. Picked up 10,000 days Tuesday. The CD is amazing. Tool has matured as a band since their inception. I think 10,000 days is a great album but you have to really like Tool to like that album. That being said, Aenima is STILL the best Tool album ever. In all honesty, it's probably my favorite album of any band ever! A masterpiece! I love all of their albums and they're definitely on my short list of all-time great bands. If you had to buy one Tool album, buy Aenima. 10,000 Days, Laterlus, and Undertow are great, but nothing like this!
B0000025DV|5.0|\\"Out of the blue\\" is one of the best albums ever made. It is unquestionably one of E.L.O's finest and I'd say that one of the best CD's you could find. Jeff Lynne genius quality once again shows all around the unique and amazing music of those guys.  <br />You'd be overwhelmed by this one, and I'd say it is no less that a masterpiece. I would suggest you try this one even if you're not familiar with E.L.O's music. It would be a good one to try at first. If you do familiar with their music but haven't heard this one, it's a must have. Don't wait. <br />This one features a lot of E.L.O's greatest hits - \\"Sweet talkin' woman\\", \\"It's over\\", \\"Turn to stone\\", and of course \\"Mr. blue sky\\" and the perfect melody - trakcs 10 through 14, including \\"Mr. blue sky\\" - an amazing one, without a doubt. <br />You'd find in this one also unfamiliar songs, but I'll bet that if you do bond with that kind of unique and wonderful music, you'd like them too,  <br />About Jeff Lynne - ladies and gentlemen, we're talking about on of the best musicians that we have ever known. I'd say - one of the best ever was, together with John Lennon and Paul McCartney. Well, maybe a bit less... but Lynn'e perfection and genius quality are most certainly apper in this title, because \\"Out of the blue\\" is for sure a masterpiece. Very well recommended.
B000EULJLU|5.0|Better than Lateralus but not quite as good as Aenima. This album is unbelievable. Haters can go about their business, but this album can take you to new places...I can't stress enough how good it is...
0804836272|5.0|Shinsengumi is one of most popular historical figures in Japan like 47 Ronins. <br />If you are fan of Rurouni Kenshin or Peace Maker, you must read this since this is the only English book about Shinsengumi. <br />I hope someone will translate great Shinsengumi novels like \\"Moeyo Ken\\" \\"Sinsengumi Keppuroku\\" \\"Bakumatsu Shinsengumi\\" etc...someday. <br /> <br />
B000EULJLU|1.0|Guys, <br /> <br />First off, I enjoy all of Tool's previous albums.  Are you listening to the same album I am?  If you guys actually listened to the music \\"deeply\\" you would realize that almost every song on this album is a recycled riff from one of their previous albums.  And the lyrics are miserable too, save for 10,000 days/wings for marie combo.  Ive also listened to the album over 15x to try to have something resonate here, and honestly I would not do that for any other band besides Tool because I know how their albums work.   <br /> <br />Therefore we have no artist progression, boring segues, and terrible lyrics.  Listen to Maynard and think for yourself; this album stinks.
B00004STPT|5.0|Hans Zimmer is by far my favorite composer, especially after listening to this soundtrack.  It is a perfect mixture of various songs, telling a story. <br /> <br />Lisa Gerrard is absolutely amazing in the soundtrack, and the last song, \\"Now we are Free,\\" is simply superb.  It's that \\"happy-sad\\" kind of song where you just sit back and smile while listening to it. <br /> <br />All of the songs on the soundtrack are soothing and beautiful.  This soundtrack is one of Hans Zimmer's greatest, and a cherished addition to my soundtrack collection.
B0006L0LOS|5.0|I JUST CAN'T BELIEVE THE COMMENTS OF SOME PEOPLE ABOUT THIS MOVIE.  I LOVED THIS MOVIE, SPECIALLY FOR SHARON STONE, I'M A BIG FAN OF HER, AND SHE LOOKED TOTALLY DELICIOUS IN THIS MOVIE. SADLY SHE WAS NOT THE CATWOMAN [:( ] BUT THE BAD, COLD AND CALCULATOR VILLAIN GIRL, STILL I LOVED HER PERFORMANCE. THE MOVIE WASN'T THE BEST OF ALL, BUT IT WAS GOOD ENOUGH TO BE WATCHED AND BE ENTERTAINING WITH A LOT OF ACTION, GOOD  SHOTS AND VISUAL EFFECTS.  THIS MOVIE WAS NOT INTENDED TO WIN ANY OSCAR OF ANY KIND, BUT THE SPECIAL VISUAL EFFECTS MAYBE.  IT WAS NOT SUPPOSED TO LEAVE YOU THINKING ABOUT ANY PROFOUND SUBJECT, BUT TO ENTERTAIN YOU.  IT MIGHT NOT BE EXACTLY THE ORIGINAL PLOT AS THE COMIC, FOR EXAMPLE, CATWOMAN WAS NOT A BLACK WOMAN, BUT ON THE TV SHOWS OF THE 1960'S, JULIE NEWMAR A WHITE WOMAN AFTER SHE LEFT THE SHOW, WAS REPLACED BY EARTHA KITT A BLACK WOMAN. THE POINT IS THAT AFTER SEVERAL TWISTS HERE AND THERE, THE MOVIE WAS INTENDED JUST TO HAVE FUN, NOT MUCH LESS THAN A DISNEY OR ANY ANIMATED OR SUPER HERO MOVIE! OR MATRIX, ARMAGEDDON, BOBSPONGE, ETC, YOU MENTION IT.  THERE'S NOT A HUGE DRAMA, DEEP MEANINGS, SHOCKING TRUE STORY OR ANYTHING REVEALING, THAN JUST A VERY SIMPLE PLOT TO HAVE YOU ENJOYING HALLE BERRY AND SHARON STONE, IN THEIR HOT OUTFITS. THIS MOVIE IS MADE FOR FUN THAT'S IT.  THE MOVIE WAS GOOD IN ITS GENRE.  I THINK THAT MANY PEOPLE IS JUST FORGETTING HOW TO ENJOY THEMSELVES!!!! THAT BEEN SAID, IT IS PROBABLY THAT THEY HAVE FOUND ALSO ATROCIOUS THE MOVIE \\"BAMBI\\" IT WAS VERY SIMPLE BUT BEAUTIFUL TOO.  IF I NEED TO BE PROFOUND I READ THE BIBLE.
B00004WGAI|4.0|I am struggling through a very poor copy of this tape, and so am ordering a 'real' tape from Amazon right now!  However, what I have seen so far is 'by the book', which is good.  Yes, wish the film was not so 'dreary', I think that's  the best word. <br />Do want to mention that so far my favorite Mr. Rochester is Orson Wells, opposite Joan Fontaine, also great as Jane.  However, it had to leave out most of the middle of the story, which was a great shame, if you read the book.  And, it also had a beautiful little Liz Taylor as 'Helen', Jane's friend at school.  Orson Wells was an absolute perfect portrayal of Mr. Rochester; not 'depressed', but 'brooding'- wonderful!
B000EULJLU|5.0|Although tool takes forever to put out an album, they always deliver! Excellent album and I just started listening to it.
055357342X|5.0|I've wanted to give this series 4.5 stars, so I'll go for five for Storm of Swords, the book with the most epic sweep, IMHO. If you can deal with the grimness and cruelty, this is a series worth sticking with for the scope of its imagined world, and range of characters. These characters continued to surprise me with the way their struggles manage to be both contrived and realistic. Perhaps most important, its an enjoyable read.
B00018D44U|5.0|(4 stars)<br /><br />\\"Feels Like Home\\", as you know, is the second album to be released from Norah Jones and it came out in 2004. Having not heard her debut \\"Come Away With Me\\", I can not compare, but this CD features some songs that have absolutely blew me away.<br /><br />The lovely \\"Sunrise\\" opens the disk and is the albums first single. It is a fun and playful but also laid-back and simple song in a way. The video is excellent by the way. \\"What Am I To You?\\" is a beautiful song which Norah wrote around the Come Away With Me era, and it features some blues and country influences and this was the second single. \\"Those Sweet Words\\" was the third single to be released from this album but it is not of my favourites. For my liking, it is just a bit bland, but not to say that it is not a very beautiful song, because it is. \\"Carnival Song\\" is another weak spot on this album. It is a slow ballad that doesn't really go anywhere for me, but this and more is forgiven with the albums best song so far \\"In The Morning\\" which brings so much life and energy back into this album! Norah's vocals and the song it self is very powerful and uplifting, and I like how it has more than one climax. It is an upbeat song and defiantly one of the best. \\"Be Here To Love Me\\" is a nice contrast to the other sings before it is written in 3/4,  and like the previous track, it is very powerful and uplifting.<br /><br />\\"Creepin' In\\" is the country duet with Dolly Parton. This song keeps the energy going and is a nice, fun track, this is again very different to all the others, but not to say that it doesn't flow well with the next track \\"Toes\\". This was one of my early favourites, and like tracks 5 and 6, it still is. The verses are very beautiful and I find the chorus very sexy, and I like the repetitiveness of the line 'My toes just touch the water'. \\"Humble Me\\" is the return of classic Norah Jones. Beginning with a simple acoustic guitar, the song becomes a very beautiful ballad, and like the sixth track, it is written in 3/4. It is atmospheric and lush. \\"Above Ground\\" completely blows me away every time I hear it. The song has such a forceful and powerful chorus, and the verses have kind of a fast-pased quality to it that I can't really explain, but it defiantly works for me. Even though the song was not written by Norah, it is one of the albums best lyrically, and actually, one of the best songs I have ever heard. \\"The Long Way Home\\" follows, and is a nice simple and dreamy song, and is followed by \\"The Prettiest Thing\\", which like the previous track is quite simple, and is good but not great, and the album closes with a very underrated track \\"Don't Miss You At All\\", which happens to be another of my favourites from this album, although it took me quite a while to really get in to. It is just Norah and her piano.<br /><br />Therefore, I do recommend this CD because there ARE some songs that will completely blow you away and Norah is one of my favourite vocalists of all-time, but it does seem to be a few tracks too long still. This CD sold very well, even compared with her debut album, which sold 20 million copies, and this album sold 11 million.<br /><br />7.5 / 10in 3/4.

B000006TRV|5.0|\\"The Wall\\" is a towering  Pink Floyd masterpiece from the brilliantly tormented mind of rock's literary genius, Roger Waters. David Gilmour takes somewhat of a supporting role here but he shines with his trademark vocals and unbeatable guitar. No one on earth plays like David Gilmour. Mason and Wright are further in the background but contribute their flavor as well.  <br /> <br />So much has been said already about \\"The Wall\\" that I won't take up the space to rehash the \\"plot\\". This amazing piece of composition is like an operatic, psychological rock journey through hope, despair, pain, alienation and once again a glimmer of hope. Although it is very personal it also becomes universal in its treatment of themes of the loss of childhood innocence, horrors of indoctrination into society, familial angst and the \\"numbing\\" of growing into adulthood and disillusionment. Everything about \\"The Wall\\" entitles it to be called a A Classic.
0525948023|4.0|this book is remarkable and invaluable in it's description of the roll of the ego and as a guide toward greater awareness of the essence of the human experience.i am however a bit curious and mystified by the emphasis on purpose. <br />if purpose means the reason that something exists or the function it serves then it is clearly within the realm of thought or logic,ergo the realm of ego.i would venture to say that the very need to \\"have,recognize or discover ones purpose\\",could effectively hinder an individual from recognizing their true nature and learning to abide in that which simply is.my personal experience of this\\"isness\\"is that there is nothing else that is needed such as an understanding or thought that \\"this is my purpose\\".for me it is the experience of the \\"peace that passeth understanding\\" and the \\"joy,joy,joy,joy, down in my heart...to STAY\\"as in forever.so,purpose,in my experience is at best superfluous and at worst an insidious ploy of the ego. <br />if you wish to experience true freedom from form and ego try letting go of purpose and simply being.in so doing you instantly allign yourself with and experience harmony with nature.this has nothing to do with understanding and everything to do with flow and the natural rythm of life. <br />as far as raising our conscious awareness being our \\"ultimate purpose\\"...this seems at odds with one of the fundamental aspects of reality as i have expereinced it which is that there is always a bigger picture.so even though the evolution of our conscious awareness is a very important part of the evolution of nature let's not sell ourselves short and say it is our defining and ultimate purpose but rather that the universe may have something even more wonderous in store for us that we are yet unaware of.a little humility might help us \\"let go into the mystery of life\\"as van the man so eloquently put it. <br />finally.thank you mr.tolle for the most easily accessible distillation and presentation of this ancient and vital information that,in my almost forty years of exposure to such ideas,i have ever come across. <br />yours,steve fosker, a.k.a.egoterorist
B000069AUI|4.0|For some reason (maybe the constant airplay of the song \\"Clocks\\" and more ) I was put off buying this cd. I hate actually commercial bands in principle , but of course the music should speak for itself Now that I finally bought it, I instantly loved almost the entire thing. It is very flowing and there are many hooks in the songs that I anticipate more and more with each listen. They still sound a bit like a weaker U2 to me , but that's ok
B000ETQRCM|5.0|I could write a review that encompasses the same old Pearl Jam review material, topics which drone on and on about wishful thinking in regards to Ten and Vs, and maybe even Vitalogy. I could also use the old standbys that pop up every few years when a new Pearl Jam CD is relased, like \\"Hey, it might be another Ten!\\" or other bloated hype. The problem is: what have Pearl Jam done wrong thus far? Nothing.     You see, Pearl Jam have done something admirable over the years, which can be seen as a stark rarity in the world of \\"what sells\\": They have made music on their terms. Not only have they done that, they have displayed their awareness of their percieved evils of fame, and what kind of creative hampering it can impose when a band like Pearl Jam is sitting on the underbelly of Ticketmaster and monsterous corporations. Along the way, hey, they have made some really great music at times, and these mentioned moments show a great band that knows it's place in the bigger spectrum of music. Pearl Jam never asked us to embrace everything they do; instead, they left it there for the taking. One has to respect that. I believe Pearl Jam's music is a reflection of where they are as artists, and change is inevitable in that sense. Change is natural as well, and brings about some of the most profound works, usually scattered through trial and error processes.    This brings me to \\"Pearl Jam\\", their eighth studio album. Once again, their newest release does not ride the coat tails of any other Pearl Jam offering. However, the basic tempo and texture of the album as a whole does indeed throw back to the early nineties, when flannel ruled the universe. Don't get me wrong, the sound itself does not make me think of \\"grunge\\" in the very general sense of the word. But what \\"Pearl Jam\\" has in common with it's early predecessors is quite noticable: it's about the individual songs.    What \\"Vitalogy\\" started was a string of CDs that were individually to be looked at as a whole. Each songon these CDs was part of a bigger overall texture. Not quite concept albums and definately not airtime singles compilations, their string of CDs in this time span never looked to be noticed. As said before, they were there for the taking.    This CD, however, is about the songs themselves, and the songs which Pearl Jam have graced us with this go-around are quite great at times. The hooks are there, but never in your face. With this easier accessibility, Pearl Jam have managed to do another great thing: they have created songs that don't come off cheesy or trendy. It's just Pearl Jam at it's best, and anyone who never had the patience to wait for them to come back to this template might want to see how they got here. It's a great collection of songs, though.    Standouts include \\"Severed Hand\\", \\"Unemployable\\", \\"Gone\\", and \\"Inside Job\\". I am not going to break the songs down and explain them, because there is nothing new or groundbreaking here. They are just great songs, which is a refreshing reminder that Pearl Jam can still make a CD which is built on the individual numbers. One would have to go back as far as \\"Vitalogy\\" to find this dynamic arrangement of songs.     Pearl Jam are \\"back\\" to some, but in reality, they never left. They have been creating what they want, and how they want all along.
B000EBEHR2|4.0|You don't need meds to like this album, although not as strong as the previous releases I still think this is a great album , especially a song to say goodbye is one of their best tracks ever. Again my thumbs up for this great band.
B0002BO0AS|5.0|I think Unearth are an awesome band. Although I really don't like metalcore that much, however they are one of the few metalcore bands that actually stand out. Their 2004 release \\"The Oncoming Storm\\" (their first album with Metal Blade) was the first Unearth album I bought, and I really like it. When I first listened to it, I though it was okay, but when I started listening to it more and before you knew it, BAM, it suddenly grew on me, and now I really like it alot. Trevor Phipps's screaming vocals are just brutal, pissed, and gut-wrenching throughout. Ken Susi and Buzz McGrath's dualing 7 string guitarwork is just awesome. These guys can do everything on here. Ferocious riffs, super heavy breakdowns, and lighting fast solos as well (listen to Zombie Autopilot for instance). You also have some nice bass lines from John Maggard, and fast, aggressive, in your face double bass drumming from Mike Justian. My favorite songs are \\"Zombie Autopilot\\", The Great Dividers\\", \\"Black Hearts Now Reign\\", \\"Failure\\" \\"This Lying World\\", \\"Bloodlust of the Human Condition\\", and \\"False Idols\\"<br /><br />The songs and the ratings:<br /><br />1. The Great Dividers - 5/5<br /><br />2. Failure - 5/5<br /><br />3. This Lying World - 5/5<br /><br />4. Black Hearts Now Reign - 5/5<br /><br />5. Zombie Autopilot - 5/5<br /><br />6. Bloodlust of the Human Condition - 5/5<br /><br />7. Lie to Purify - 5/5<br /><br />8. Endless - 5/5<br /><br />9. Aries - 5/5<br /><br />10. Predetermined Sky - 5/5<br /><br />11. False Idols - 5/5<br /><br />Overall score: 100/100<br /><br />Grade: A+ all the way<br /><br />Forget Atreyu, this is REAL metalcore, buy this album now<br /><br />LONG LIVE UNEARTH!!
B0007OCG56|4.0|I just want to say that Tea Leoni has quickly become one of my favorite actresses.  She has shown in the past two or three years that she has talent I NEVER noticed before.  Anyways, I just wanted to make mention of that while it was on my mind.  Spanglish was a film I had wanted to see but never had the urge to spend money to see, but since the library had it and it was a free rental I picked it up over the weekend.  I just want to say that although it may have not been marketed perfectly, you have to know walking into this film that it is by no means a 'comedy' in the sense that most 'comedies' are today.  It's more along the lines of 'The Family Stone' just not as good.  It's a drama with funny scenes.  The heart of this movie is not to make you laugh but to make you think.  The story revolves around Flor Moreno (Paz Vega), a single Latina who is strugling to raise her pre-teen daughter Christina (Shelbie Bruce) in LA.  She gets a job house cleaning for the Clasky family, but she never could have known what she was getting herself or her daughter into.  The Clasky's are not your typical family...their off, just a little.  John (Adam Sandler) is a top-notch chef and the 'sane' one in the family.  Deborah (Leoni) is the high strung, depressed and over whelmed mother who doesn't know how to deal with herself let alone her family.  Deborah's mother (Cloris Leachman) is a drunk ex-jazz singer who serves as the reason and also the solution to most of Deborah's problems.  Bernice (Sarah Steele), the overweight daughter, is going through those normal teenage years and is starting to butt heads with her mother enough to loath her for it.  Oh yeah, and they have a son but he never speaks.  As Flor moves in with the Clasky's over the summer the families start to interact in ways neither of them expected and bonds are formed between each and evrey one of them, while walls are built around others.  Writer/director James L. Brooks for the most part gets this very right for hecreates people that we care about while painting a picture that is very believable.  The actors, especially Leoni, really sink their teeth into their roles, and Paz is such a warm hearted delight she's such a joy to watch on the screen.  Sandler tackled a role I would have never expected him too and he surprised me by pulling it off.  As I said, this is a dramedy with a lot of heart, a lot of humor and a lot of sincerity.  I'd pick it up, if you haven't already.
B000EULJLU|5.0|A much needed relief with all the poptrashed candy labeled overproduced crap thats out there ruining the music industry. A solid band does not have to crank out albums every 18 months and tour for only 6. A good album should hold a tour for 2 years... maybe 3 if the record sells world wide. That leaves a while to recover then go back into the studio for a year or 2. Look at all the good rock bands. They do not release a greatist hits album until 6 or more albums spanning over a decade. Your average commercialized band has a greatest hits after 3 albums. Its because they lack creativity. Those bands attempt and a poor one at that to give the fans what they want to hear not what they need to hear. Tool is one of those bands, a cerebral one at that creat music for sake of god music. The imagery and song writing convey many complex themes that force the listener to LISTEN and find the message that they need to hear. Come up with your own thought through the music. Don't criticise it. Listen to it. This album is meant to be played as one long thematic song. Like Lateralus, its an album that one can listen to without skipping around. Of you are looking for quick fixes, buy that processed crap out there. But if you want to sit back and truly understand and appreciate music for what it is, buy this album. Tool is a great rock band indeed and a monumental musical group over all. They don't need commercials, video, and reality TV to make them who they are. Tool will stand amongst the greats like pink floyd. Generations will buy tool albums for years to come. Enough said.
B000ETQRCM|5.0|I never thought Pearl Jam would write a song that could replace  Yellow Ledbetter  as their closing anthem, but they have.  If Pearl Jam played \\"Come Back\\" at the end of a show, I wouldn't be disappointed at all.  It has the same emotional outpour, a guitar part that can make you cry, and the overall feeling of closure.  Can you imagine the whole crowd singing along with Eddie during extended versions at the end of shows?  It would be a captivating experience that one would never forget.   <br /> <br />Pearl Jam have reflected on their career, taken aspects from every album (and the history of classic rock) and made them flow together in one deep, beautiful album.   <br /> <br />\\"Life Wasted\\" is the superior child of previous rockers like  \\"Brain of J\\" and \\"Blood.\\" After repeated listens, the chorus charges in your head with as much energy as anything Pearl Jam has done.  And just when the song slows down and seems to lose its fervor, McCready pulls out a guitar solo that's simply stunning.  It gives me goosebumps every time. <br /> <br />It's hard for me to be objective about \\"World Wide Suicide\\" since I played the song so many times before the album was released.  I don't think I can necessarily give a fair critique at this point.  I will say this though, \\"World Wide Suicide\\" has made the U.S. sing along with Pearl Jam again. <br /> <br />\\"Comatose\\" is immediate and raging.  Eddie's vocals are more raw than they have been in a long time.  This song is the twisted brother of \\"Spin the Black Circle\\" but it has got the advantage of being created now as opposed to 1994.  And what I mean by that is Pearl Jam is much more mature and aware of exactly what they're doing now than they were then.   <br /> <br />\\"Severed Hand's\\" chorus is an angled, descending wonder.  When the song slows down, Eddie unveils an awesome lyric, \\"If I don't lose control/ Explore and not explode...\\" with laser guitar effects shooting behind it that create this intense landscape in my mind.  I get the feeling of a battle that would take place in Star Wars. <br /> <br />\\"Marker in the Sand\\" has a breezy feeling reminiscent of Yield.  Eddie's vocals are once again jagged and sliding but they remain melodic as well, something that is rare and exciting.  And the chorus is probably the best on the CD, which is saying a lot because there are so many good ones.  Near the end of the song, there's a transition that reminds me of the feeling I got during some songs on Lost Dogs.  You know the one, Eddie even discussed in one of his recent interviews, when you imagine yourself driving (if you aren't) and passing open fields and clear skies. <br /> <br />\\"Parachutes\\" is really a mood piece.  It's like \\"Around the Bend\\" and \\"All Those Yesterdays\\" got married.  It has a nice sound and a lofty harmony that is very Beatle-like but is probably my least favorite song on the album.  It just doesn't capture me like the others do.  Then again, it wasn't meant to.  It's an easy, flowing song that just passes by.  There's nothing wrong with that. <br /> <br />I agree with the reviewer who said that \\"Unemployable\\" is a better REM song than REM has written in years.  It's so true.  I can picture Stipe and them doing this song and it works perfectly.  What really makes \\"Unemployable\\" succeed are the background vocals and the Neil Youngish plucks that are straight out of \\"Rockin' in the Free World.\\"  I think the song could've done without the \\"Ah Oh Oh\\" part, but it doesn't ruin anything. <br /> <br />\\"Big Wave\\" seems to be just a surfing song but really has deeper roots in evolution, \\"I used to be a crustacean/ In an underwater nation.\\"  The rhythm has a Riot Act feel to it but the solo's passion is right out of this album.  I don't think this song really adds much, but it doesn't take anything away from the CD. <br /> <br />\\"Gone\\" comes from a long tradition of songs like \\"Indifference,\\" \\"Immortality,\\" and \\"Given to Fly.\\"  It absolutely takes hold of the listener and puts them in the shoes of the character.  Everyone has those days when they just want to disappear from the world and this song captures the feeling perfectly.  My muscles relax as soon as I hear the beginning.  It belongs right up there with Pearl Jam's best stuff.  <br /> <br />\\"Wasted Reprise\\" is more than just filler.  It gives us a new perspective on the melody from Life Wasted that could easily get lost in the song's rush.  <br /> <br />\\"Army Reserve\\" is the best Binaural track that Binaural doesn't have.  At first you might not even pay attention to this song because there are so many great songs around it.  But after many listens, this track is outstanding.  And once again, the backing vocals are a huge part of it.  They harmonize with Ed's extending voice so well.  The guitars echo each other exceptionally throughout the song. <br /> <br />\\"Inside Job\\" is like a combination of \\"Space Oddity\\" and \\"Stairway to Heaven\\" done by Pearl Jam.  The piano reminds me of Van Halen at their best, but, of course, used for a much better song.  Eddie's whispering vocals and the eerie guitars create an incredible vibe that shimmers all the way through.  The progression is totally classic rock but works extremely well.  Towards the end, they take the song and make it their own.  This isn't Led Zeppelin or the Who, this is Pearl Jam and I wouldn't want it any other way.   <br /> <br />\\"Pearl Jam\\" A-
B000EULJLU|5.0|I never write reviews for anything, but I felt compelled to throw my two cents in on this cd.  This album is one of the best albums, period.  You have to sit down and take time away from the hectic pace of life and absorb this masterpiece from start to finish without interuption.  It's like one beautiful soundtrack that flows from one texture and progression to the next.  I have a few friends that are highly dissapointed with it, but I think they and others just will not be able to get it.  don't get it.  To me, it's hard rock's pinnacle \\"Pink Floydish\\" result that still delivers a blasting Tool edge to it.  Now if only their live performance was as visually stunning as Floyd.
B000003CKH|5.0|I bought every Cake CD within the span of a few weeks after I finally got hooked by \\"Short Skirt, Long Jacket\\" from Comfort Eagle.  For a long time, Comfort Eagle was my favorite Cake album.  The problem is, ask me on any given day now and it'd probably be a toss-up between Fashion Nugget, Prolonging the Magic and Comfort Eagle. <br /> <br />The fact is that Cake has never released a dud.  Their first album suffers in quality, but considering they were unknowns at the time, one can't blame them for working on a shoestring budget.  The music is still great. <br /> <br />At the end of the day, I find myself coming back to Fashion Nugget again and again.  The big single on this album, \\"The Distance\\" is, in my opinion, one of the weaker songs.  That's saying a lot.  Check out Frank Sinatra, Friend is a Four Letter Word, and Daria for a small glimpse into the genius that is Cake.  The lyrical imagery and their catchy melodies quietly wrap themselves around your brain.  They are certainly the masters of making more out of less. <br /> <br />If you ever get a chance to go see Cake live, do it.  Watch everybody sing the lyrics to every song.  It's a great experience.  If you've heard their typical radio fare (Rock 'N Roll Lifestyle, The Distance, Never There, and Short Skirt) and have been even mildly interested, you owe it to yourself to go buy Fasion Nugget.  You'll soon find yourself owning all of their releases.  As a good friend of mine would say, \\"Trust me\\".
B000EULJLU|4.0|the only reason i gave this 4 stars is the inclusion of \\"filler sounds\\". i dont need them, but hey, it's tool, so you know they will be there. the songs are powerful and moving. the lyrics - especially wings/10,000 days - are amazing, and really give you alot of insight into what maynard was thinking during his mother's long illness and ultimate death. he's an amazing song writer, and the rest of the band are extremely advanced musicians. can't wait to see them again on tour!
B00005S6K6|4.0|I fall in love with this masterpiece.<br />Meryl streep's performance in this movie is so realistic<br />that makes one heart cry.<br />Molly's garments are gorgeous,The plot is simple,clear,completed,truthful and meaningful.<br />It's a heartfelt-hope love that can happen to anyone.<br />The mind has a faculty to reason,but not the heart.<br />Meryl streep is the most feminine movie star in the 80's.<br />Even now.
B000BW7QWW|5.0|I find that I am difficult to please when it comes to major motion pictures.  Most of the time, I leave the theater disappointed or let-down.  There's always something that just does not work for me. <br /> <br />Serenity is an exception.  This is a movie that gets better with each watching.  I loved Firefly and this film was a fitting, big-screen version that extended the story into new places. <br /> <br />Thanks to Joss Whedon, thanks to the spectacular cast -- sparkling performances across the board -- and thanks to Universal for taking a chance.  We Browncoats will continue to support this franchise for a long time to come. <br /> <br />Now, can we please have our sequel?  :)
B000EULJLU|5.0|I didnt get a copy until one a.m. in the morning, and when I got it I was kind of just like Wha? Im sure many had this feeling as they listened to this cd. I admit at first I started to get disapointed, but after listening to it more then once you really apreciate it. This time tool seemed to go more with a psycadellic/progressional rock aproach, wich is common with most tool, but this time it was all around a difrent sound with a bit of tool goodness on the side. Over all I wouldnt say its my favorite tool album, but it is a great cd and I really enjoyed it. I havnt stopped listening to it, it has alot more of a message then usual. Im a tool freak so of course I give this cd a perfect score, Tool didnt let me down, they just used a difrent aproach, but as usual they brought greatness to the table for us to feast upon.
B00005JOUM|5.0|This isn't a typical bank heist film.  This film really shows Spike Lee's brilliance and silences the critics who say that he's too fixated on racial issues.  It's one of the most intelligently written movies I've seen in a while.      The film opens with an apparent bank robbery... later however we discover that it's not an odinary bank robbery.  Actually, the \\"robbers\\" are not after one cent of the bank's money.  The robbers it turns out have a personal interest in something which has far reaching ramifications beyond the bank.  There is a larger message to the film however which is easily missed if one gets too tied up in the details of the film.  If I were to explain the message I got out of the film it would give away the plot.  For this reason I've decided to not discuss it.
0316168815|2.0|This is a very disappointing book. The disappointment, for me, came from the fact that the subject so important and touching, as the bestial murder of a child and grief of the family, should be presented in equally moving manner. Even if the narrator is the child victim, which, obviously, necessitates some simplifications of the prose. Instead, Sebold's novel is formally conventional, very boring and predictable. I can understand its being a recommended reading for schoolchildren, because it can be a warning and fulfills the educational purposes, maybe getting to the adolescent child better than pamphlets and science, but if you are not a teenager and/or are looking for something else that a warning in a book, this would be a waste of time.
B000EULJLU|5.0|It's really not fair to compare Tool to Tool. Holding these guys to account for not reaching the level of Aenima is like criticizing Da Vinci for producing only one Mona Lisa. Aenima may be the all time rock and roll masterpiece. 10,000 Days is a great album in its own right - there's not a single other band out there now - maybe not ever - that could create songs like Vicarious, the title track, Jambi, and Right in Two. Vicarious will take its place with the all-time Tool greats, and 10,000 Days has brought no shame to Tool - rather it has extended the glory of the greatest musical team in the history of rock and roll.
B000EULJLU|5.0|great album, so different yet so familiar.   Love every song on it.  It's a great hearing experience <br /> <br />best songs- love every song on the album....can't wait to see it played live
B000EULJLU|5.0|The first few times I listened to 10,000 Days, I found it to be rather disappointing. But 10,000 Days doesn't give up her secrets quickly.  You have to get to know this album, and let it penetrate you.  I find myself loving it more and more every time I play it.  Aenima was a brilliant album of songs.  This is a singular experience.  Give it time, give it a chance.
0451450523|5.0|Oh, for heaven's sake.  \\"Not as good as the movie?\\"  I want to hit my head against the wall.  Almost as brain-numbing as the same phrase applied to The Princess Bride.  If I weren't so dang verbal, I'd be speechless.  I will admit I have not been as engaged with Beagle's other stories.  But this book is one of a very few I've come across in my long history of reading-odd, moving, entertaining on the surface, but provoking in the most philosophical sense-lyrical, controlled, well-played, witty and haunting.  You don't get to write this kind of book often in your life.  In the play of the language there are shadings and suggestions of truth that could NEVER come out in a visual presentation of the \\"story.\\"  When you strip the plot of its verbal constructs, you lose the essential  joy, the possibility of discovery, the amazing chance to see a little more deeply into what your life may mean. <br /> <br />This story is romantic.  But in the most classic sense.  The unicorn's journey is away from a world that has grown too sure of its own reality, fascinated with the work of its own hands-blind, limited, short teathered and terrified of losing what it thinks it owns.  Beagle is right about us.  You could think he is talking about something as simple as growing up; certainly, growing up has hobbled my senses.  But stopping at that would be stopping short. <br /> <br />The sacrifice offered is archetypal, and I believe that is the source of the story's depth.  For this book is more parable than fable, and magic in a true way. <br /> <br />And there is this: why would the unicorn have made the journey, unless it was hope driving her?  And that, I think, is what I was left with when I finally finished the book.  I could feel hope.  And I could feel wonder.  This alone is worth the price of admission.  <br /> <br />But I make the book sound too serious and heavy.  The language flows beautifully.  The book is a joy to read.  Best to read it in springtime, though.  About the time the lilacs blow - <br />        <br />I've never met Mr. Beagle and probably never will.  But there is something about the writing in this book that makes me curious about what kind of person could have done it.  And that, I must say, is part of the pleasure-
B000002KAT|5.0|Without a doubt, one of the most precious musical offerings ever. All of the songs are perfect and work perfectly in establishing a mood somewhat mystical, somewhat spiritual, somewhat nostalghic, somewhat melancholic, but ultimately always uplifting. Astral Weeks is an experiece for the fortunate who listen, get it, and dig it. Love it.
B000EULJLU|5.0|THE BAND: Maynard James Keenan (vocals), Adam Jones (guitars), Danny Carey (drums & percussion), Justin Chancellor (bass).<br /><br />THE DISC: (2006) 11 songs clocking in at approximately 76 minutes. The case and contents are like no other compact disc I own... a book-like fold out with 30 pages of odd pictures (band pictures too) and 3-D lenses included (as part of the case itself). I feel a piece of velcro (or something) on the front cover would have greatly help to keep the whole package closed. The disc slides into the front inside pocket and is well protected (though hard to release). Recorded at O'Henry's, Grandmaster, and The Loft - all in Burbank or Hollywood, CA. Label - Sony Music.<br /><br />COMMENTS: I needed a few days to let this whole CD sink in. I can say that \\"10,000 Days\\" picks up where \\"Lateralus\\" left off. Dark, bleak, angst driven alternative meets heavy metal. Songs touch on death, love and love lost, inner pain and struggle, and even politics. Nothing surprising here. Seems like every 5 years we're treated to a new disc. \\"Undertow\\" (1991), \\"Aenima\\" (1996), \\"Lateralus\\" (2001), are all classic albums in their own right (not forgetting about their wonderful EP \\"Opiate\\" either). Sure, \\"10,000 Days\\" is more of the same - but TOOL is so vastly different than most anything else out there. Give this disc time and repeated spins to digest. Best rocking songs here are \\"The Pot\\", the opener \\"Vicarious\\", and \\"Jambi\\" with Jones' quick rhythm guitar licks. The title track and my favorite song on the album, \\"Roseta Stoned\\", both exceed the 11 minute mark. Both are trademark TOOL songs featuring soft intro's and a heavy middle section and incredible off beat Danny Carey drumming. This album also features a few soundscapes - little or no vocals and very mellow - \\"Wings For Marie\\", \\"Lost Keys\\", and \\"Intension\\". The only strike against \\"10,000 Days\\" is the odd closer, \\"Viginti Tres\\"... which sounds like an 5 minute exercise in scarce sound effects. Even if this album doesn't push the envelope, or take the band in a new direction - it's still great music by talented and accomplished musicians. Many reviewers are trashing this album saying it's \\"more of the same\\"... I see it as more of the same music I've loved for the past 15 years. It's just too bad we have to wait so long in between releases. Fans of Tool and Keenan's solo projects will not be disappointed here. Great disc.ush the envelope, or take the band in a new direction - it's still great music by talented and accomplished musicians.

B000EMGAGW|2.0|SOME HOW I KNEW THIS WAS NOT GOING TO BE A CLASSIC MOBB DEEP ALBUM,YES I AM A BIG FAN OF THESE CAT'S....BUT WHEN YOU ALL ABOUT THE MONEY,YOU FORGET YOUR OWN WAY OF STYLE!!!!....WHAT EVER HAPPEN TO TYMAX..GOD FATHER 3...GAMBINO????...NOYD????I MAY BE WRONG ABOUT NOYD.....BUT I GUESS G-UNIT IS THE NEW FAMILY,THATS SCARY!!!!
B000EULJLU|1.0|With all due respect to TOOL, I don't get 10k days, obviously I missed the pre-release info that may have stated their direction and/or intention.  <br /> <br />Of any band that could tweek styles, and get away with it, I thought TOOL could pull it off, as TOOLs passion, talent is second to none, and I dont ? it here(duh), but somehow 10k days left me is sobbing, and praying for \\"TOOL\\" to show up. I began to think I was listening to one of the many TOOL \\"wannabees\\", I was irritated by the throat growling singing, etc. The length of tracks could be appreciated, IF...they had pulled it off, which they had \\"patented\\" in Lateralus. 10k actually bored me.  <br /> <br />It reminds me of the movie Jerry Mcguire, when he wrote his \\"mission statement\\"(totally changing your ways, except for \\"Vicarious\\", which sounded eerily similar to a famous Lateralus track), which eventually got him fired. Is this TOOLs' \\"mission statement\\"? If it was a mission statement, and they go back to their \\"TOOL\\" ways, then i'd THINK about buying another album. As of now, no!  <br /> <br />Please TOOL, dont pull a Jerry mcGuire...
B00005A46T|4.0|This is the most agressive,and brutal SlipKnoT album...but this is not enough for i called this cd real or true metal.They have got a sampler,DJ,and 2 extra percussionist...and what ? This is an unique lineup,and everybody plays his instruments.Ok,the bass isn't very audible,but the solo guitartist Mick,and drummer Joey playes great,and fast.Corey is avarage vocalist,but he isn't make very heavy roars,or sometimes singing melodious.I not called this cd Metal,or Thrash,but this is a very heavy Nu-metal.Please,try this cd...not so bad,but if you want 100% metal,listen some Kreator, Children Of Bodom,or electric/industrial-metal Fear Factory,Rob Zombie,Rammstein.
B000EULJLU|3.0|First off I tend to be strict in my ratings. I would give this 3 1/2 stars but amazon does not have the option and this isnt a 4 star album. Lateralus was such a great album in my opinion (one of the best rock albums of the past 20 years) that tool was almost forced to do something the complete opposite. Lateralus i think is the only album I have given 5 stars too. Aenema gets 4 stars. 10,000 days album art is amazing and the lenses are cool too except i havent quite figured out how they work. And we are all comparing this to their past efforts, and not necessarily against the music industry as a whole right now. Obviously this blows away anything else that is being played on the radio, music that the big record labels deem \\"cutting edge\\". I would of thought that the guys would of had more material after five years, would it have been too much to expect a double album? Oh well with that being said I still enjoy it. I guess the next radiohead album will be the next release that I am looking forward to the most.
B000EULJLU|5.0|Seeing as this is my first Tool CD and really my first true encounter with the band, I was unsure of what I was going to be getting into, basing the purchase off of Vicarious and Forty Six & 2, the only songs of theirs I had heard. Wow, I was really blown away. The only song I skip over is Lipan Conjuring as it is just tribal drums an chanting for about a minute. Besides that I feel the album flows great and really feels like one large song rather than 11 completely unrelated songs that really have no real connection. Some of my favorite songs that, if you don't buy the album, you should definitely download are Vicarious, 10,000 Days, and Right In Two. For a brand new Tool fan, this is an excellent listen and excellent buy.
B00003CXDV|4.0|This movie is a great movie.  Kids and adults should enjoy.  Even not star trek fans.
B000EULJLU|5.0|I always get very mad at least a dozen times during the 5 year breaks in Tools work schedule. Are they ever gonna release another album, or tour again?  <br /> <br />well so far theyve followed through. <br /> <br />this album is f*cking out of control. i dont even like metal but these guy are such good musicians, and really know how to write some crazy stuff. Sick
0977326403|5.0|I was so encouraged to see this new monograph. I work in a nonprofit and have struggled in applying some of the concepts from the Good to Great book to the nonprofit context. But this simple addition provides clarity and focus.<br /><br />I really appreciated the balanced view that Jim took regarding how \\"busines-like\\" a nonprofit should be. It is so freeing to not have to be like a business but instead shoot for being a disciplined organization. I go back to his comment \\"Disciplined People - Disciplined Thought - Disciplined Action\\" constantly and am working to make that a reality in our organization.<br /><br />Jim Collins impressed me for another reason as well. Instead of coming out with another edition of the book to add this chapter - which would have been much more lucrative - he decided to be a generous mind and share this in the form of a much less expensive monograph. What a help to nonprofits!<br /><br />A must read if you work with or for nonprofits.
B000EULJLU|3.0|My name is Reed Alliston not Betty Alliston. I love tool. Ever since I picked up there first full album undertow, I fell in love. Every song on that album was good. There wasn't weird noises it was all vocals, guitar, drums, and bass. 10,000 days is my second album to pick up by tool. Vicarious, Jambi, The Pot, Lost keys, and Rossetta stoned are the hardest and best songs on the album except lost keys it just has a great rythm to it. The rest I fell asleep to. <br /> <br /> It was just one long song after another. It would start out slow than pick up just a little bit than go back slow than end. I read in guitar world that Adam jones worked out math problems, to make his music. Music does not have to be complicated. <br /> <br />   Why can't they just Rock. They have lost there touch. Danny Carry is still excellent on the drums. Adam Jones has a great riff and solo on Jambi. I don't lik Manyard's voice anymore. I don't know if he talks to fast and hard, but i miss his voice from undertow it just flowed wonderfully with the music and the arrangements were great. The vocals, to me, seem like there slowing the music down. It's kind of like he just starts talking and keeps going and right when you think he is going to get in a heavy chorus it goes down. <br /> <br /> I know the band is all in to art, but to me they are not metal any more. I read in a review that manyard said he was over the mad songs which were undertow. I dont care make happy ones that rock. Four songs on a 11 track album that rock are not enough. <br /> <br /> Every song on undertow was good, you couldn't wait till the next. It might just be me, but I was not that impressed. They are starting to sound like boring composers. I like the album, don't get me wrong I went and bought on the first day, I am not trying to bash it, but I do think they could be better, I know there better.  <br /> <br />There is a freaking tribal dance on the cd. They sound like a bunch of Indians. THats not music that is Freaking FILLER!! I am going to go back and listent to aenima and Laterlus. I heard those singles and loved them. <br /> <br /> I still love tool, but quit trying to make the music so complex where it's not fun to listen to it. If you are a serious hard rocker don't buy the album just download those 4 songs and you will be impressed, but the rest isn't great. I have listend to the album twice. I am going to listen to it again. I still don't think that will change my mind.
B0009R1T7M|5.0|In the 70's we had Cat Stevens and in this abstract and complex age we have Sufjan.   Sufjan Stevens is one of the most interesting musical artists I have run into in a long time.   What a myriad of instrumentation.  He is not afraid to experiment with a variety of melodies either.   The lyrics can be MOST profound as in \\"Oh god of progress, have you degraded or forgot us? Where have your walls gone? I think about it now.\\"   He has the courage to sing about John Gacy when commercial artists would not have the courage to even touch a subject like that.     What you get with Sufjan is a collage of pure honesty.  What does real honesty look like?  A little like a Pollack painting, but with beautifully blended colors.   Incredibly inventive use of the banjo...WOW!!!    This is guy is not afraid to be totally himself, to take the road less traveled and I respect that.
B000EHRVP6|3.0|This movie was fun, but I wouldn't watch it again. The trip through Europe is cool and the European chicks are hot. Pretty gruesome scenes, but nothing deeply terrifying. The scene with Josh is pretty freaky, and he's a good screamer. I liked the crazy guy towards the end of the movie who asks, \\"what it's like?\\"    This film kinda makes a person wonder if these types of hunting clubs really exist. Now THAT'S a scary thought.    If you want real gore with a lasting psychological impact, skip the fictional horror in this flick and others, and go rent any of the Faces of Death movies.
B000EWBKM6|5.0|Gonna be sad to see this one go :( , Weird thing is - Seasons 1 through  to 7 box setsare available in the UK just now - its strange that the states are only up to season 4. <br /> <br />Just hope that the spin off \\"Just Jack \\" as i call it lol , goes ahead. Or mabye even a spin off called \\" Jack & Karen \\" lol , but hopefully what happend with joey wont dampen things if the writers continue to bring us even one of the charecters :)
B000ETQRCM|4.0|There has been a lot of hype surrounding the new self titled Pearl Jam album as everyone says it is their best work in over a decade. Well that really says much since it can't be hard to be better than the bland rock they have been churning starting with the release of No Code. But with that said, this album is indeed better than anything they have released during that time frame, but still is no way near as good as their first three albums. <br /> <br />The album is the band's first in four years and the rest did do them good as there seems to be a spring back in their step, or it could also have been their time on the Vote for Change Tour lit a match underneath them, as sharing a stage with Bruce Springsteen can definitely have a positive effect on musicians. The album starts off with the twin guitar assault by Stone Gossard and Mike McCready on Life Wasted and the you should have downloaded it when it was free on the band's website World Wide Suicide which roar with ferocity that will undoubtedly will become a highlight of their live shows. Then Comotose is fast romp that is the closest the band has gotten to puck yet. <br /> <br />But what made Pearl Jam great is their diversity, yeah, they rocked, but were still able to slow things down, go acoustic, and make some eerily good music too. Marker in the Sand effortlessly switches from an angst fill verse to a mellower chorus with ease. The back to back Parachutes and Unemployable both sound like something from the British Invasion. The conclusion on Wasted Reprise sounds like something that could have come off their collaboration with Neil Young on Mirror Ball. The somber Come Back is their most heart wrenching song ever not named Betterman. Then the closer is the very moody Inside Job that builds to a eerie conclusion that grabs your attention for all of it's seven minutes. <br /> <br />The stories are more poignant as ever even as Eddie Vedder's delivery seems to be more indecipherable as ever. World Wide Suicide is a full on assault on the Bush administration. Unemployable follows a dude just issued his pink slip on his journey on trying to get another job. But the one that hits closest to home, and happens to be the closest to the Pearl Jam of old, is on Army Reserve, an elegy to the wives and children of those serving in our armed forces today. Hopefully this album singles an upswing the band will be on for years to come.
B00004XONN|3.0|Most Radiohead fans are crazy about Kid A.  I have to admit it took more than one listen for me to really get into it.  Even then, I'm not sure that this is their best disc - it's so experimental - just seems to fall short of showing what great musicians these guys really are.  Kid A strikes me as something they did when they were fooling around and not quite serious.  But again, some fans find great depth here and really relate to these songs.  I don't think I've reached that point yet.  That will take a few more plays.<br /><br />If this is your first Radiohead purchase, do yourself a favor and get \\"OK Computer\\" first instead.  If you're excited about what you heard there, then feel free to spring for Kid A.
B000EULJLU|5.0|I have never been a major fan of Tool, mainly there older stuff(that didn't appeal to me) minus a few songs. I loved Lateralus so, I wasn't really sure what to expect from this album.I was really hoping that the sound I loved from Lateralus would carry over. Lucky Me :D<br /><br />  This album is amazing I love the throbbing basslines and the droning synths here and there. The guitar is great and the drums are amazing.Maynard's voice is really stimulating on this album.<br /><br />  I love the Pot and 10,000 days and every other song hahaha.<br /><br />  The cover art is Amazing, any ways pick it up you just might like it, I know I did.
B000EULJLU|5.0|Just like others have said, you should listen to this the whole way through.  If you're looking for a cd to rock out in your car the whole time, this isn't it.  You have to sit back and actually LISTEN to it.  It's a very complex disc that really shows off the bands talent.  I can see the younger crowd not liking it as much.  I however love this cd and it grows on me the more I listen to it.
B00005JKN9|4.0|Scorsese made an admirable picture about factions in New York in the XIX Century. Once more it? s good to remark, this picture is far to be a simple apology about the violence. On the contrary, it's a striking allegation around the fact, the violence is a basic component of the human behavior. And under certain circumstances (emotional, affective or ideological) ignites by itself. So from this perspective you will watch a crude portrait, a potent allegory, a brutal story, an intense description of the human nature in its more absolute nakedness.<br /><br />The eye camera scrutinizes all the dark corners of this demolishing story, emphasizing the inner motivations that induce to that vehement explosion of outrage.<br /><br />Perhaps the final sequences exceed excessively exaggerate, due the previous sequences have been enough violent by themselves and consequently the expected climax does not work out, since it maybe seen simply as an programmatic appendix of the storytelling.<br /><br />Daniel Day Lewis, once more shows us why he is one of the finest actors of his generation. Cameron Diaz and Di Caprio have never been better. The portentous cinematography is really mesmerizing.<br /><br />This is an emblematic film, because it reflects another historical perspective, so many times discussed but scarcely taken to screen. Bold and controversial, as the most of films of this talented director.
B0002ZDVEU|4.0|The Bourne Supremacy continues the adventures of reluctant assassin/spy Jason Bourne that began in The Bourne Identity.<br /><br />Bourne is now hiding out with his girlfriend from the first film when he is targeted for assassination. A surprise or two later, Bourne is again on the prowl, but instead of being just a hunted/wanted man as he was in the Bourne Identity, he commits to fighting proactively against those who are against him.<br /><br />The Bourne Supremacy has some great actions sequences, including a great fight scene with a fellow assassin, and one of the greatest car chases since Bullitt. The involved plot is sometimes too distracting, and the sheer fun and terror of the first film is diluted by all of this, but director Paul Greengrass does not ruin the film, and this film definitely keeps the viewer anticipating the next Bourne adventure.
B0007VZ9DK|5.0|This ambitious film has too many angles to scrutinize. The main dramatic line deals with the affective lack of both sides, the commander in chief (De Niro) of this Empire (once more the power and the love seem to be irreconcilable partners) and a trivial girl (Sharon Stone) who seeks the best of both worlds: the freedom she enjoyed and the financial security of her new status. But besides there is another aspect much more relevant to my mind: the awful fact the human being is not redeemable; this is a disturbing statement that may strike the sensibility of many beautiful souls.<br /><br />Both worlds are simply divergent: De Niro falls in love with an ideal, (Pygmalion effect) and overlooks the real woman and her personal convictions, aspirations and horizon of life. She is much more convinced than him about this union; to her the marriage is a convenience act, a revalorization of her social status and a reinsertion in the new social spheres, but as you and me know, sometimes the past is a heavy chain of livings and memories.<br /><br />On the other hand we have Joe Pesci, a newcomer who has been invested of pretended authority and love for power. Excess and lack of scrupulous dictate his steps and only the long arm of the fate will be able to stop him with the expected consequences.<br /><br />Casino is, in last instance, a modern fable; a film that reveals nobody is either absolutely happy or free of innocence; it' s a smart metaphor of the life. Once more, the arresting narrative style is another of the golden guests of this movie; the fabulous stages are told with a beating intensity.<br /><br />At the moment you consider a reduced list of the top Five films of this talented filmmaker this is securely should be included in the most of the lists.
1400079179|5.0|Some Christians are concerned that Dan Brown's novel The DaVinci Code is an attack on the Church, on Jesus, the Bible.  This might be because there is so much fact woven into the fiction of the story.  How do we discern one from the other, and what is the effect of this on the non-believer or the little-bit-of-a-believer, and--heaven help us--the devout believer?<br /><br />I come under the Devout heading, and I say, bring on The DaVinci Code.  Jesus the Christ can handle this novel, even this well-researched, world-famous blockbuster about to be released as a movie starring Tom Hanks.<br /><br />In Cracking  DaVinci's Code, authors James L. Garlow and Peter Jones argue that Brown's assertions in the text that his information is based on facts could instigate a crisis in the faith.  They are taking issue with the literary device of verisimilitude, a device as old as the novel itself.  Brown is allowed to do that, and you and I, as Coleridge would put it, are allowed to suspend my disbelief to see what his work of art offers the millennia-old conversation about faith--and to the genre of the Chase Story.<br /><br />After reading Brown's book, I found myself recalling a moment during a Sunday-morning adult Advent Bible study class a few years ago.<br /><br />We were looking at the Christmas pageant passage from the Gospel of Luke --angels, shepherds, Wise Men, the holy family--and a middle-aged woman asked, \\"Did it really happen like that?\\"<br /><br />s<br /><br />The pastor replied, \\"I don't know if it looked exactly the way Luke describes it, but I believe it represents the truth.\\"<br /><br />In this way, he said what Code protagonist Robert Langdon tells Sophie at the end of this elaborate chase story:  \\"Sophie, every faith in the world is based on fabrication.  That is the definition of faith--acceptance of that which we imagine to be true, that which we cannot prove.  Every religion describes God through metaphor, allegory, and exaggeration....Metaphors are a way to help our minds process the unprocessible.  The problems arise when we begin to believe literally in our own metaphors.\\"  And later:  \\"Religious allegory has become a part of the fabric of reality.  And living in that reality helps millions of people cope and be better people.\\"<br /><br />American novelist John Cheever put it this way in an interview with the Paris Review in 1976:  \\"The telling of lies is a sort of sleight of hand that displays our deepest feelings about life.\\"<br /><br />Theologian Huston Smith puts it this way when discussing the authorship of one of Paul's letters in his book The Soul of Christianity, Restoring the Great Tradition.  Smith recounts a tale of a New Testament scholar who can't wait to get to heaven to ask St. Paul if he did write the Letter to the Ephesians.  Paul's response:  \\"Yes, I think I did.\\"  Huston's point:  \\"Who cares?\\"  The value of the Paul's letter to the Ephesians for the contemporary reader is less its authorship than its ability to further our spiritual inquiry.<br /><br />The point?  Through story we get as close as we possibly can to the Truth.  Maybe that's why we take good care of our holy books.  Perhaps that's why churches put on Christmas pageants.  We want our kids to climb inside the skins of those characters--even the sheep--to be there for themselves as well as for us.<br /><br />I recall watching the episode of Inside the Actor's Studio during which Willem Dafoe was the guest.  Host James Lipton brought up Martin Scorcese's The Last Temptation of Christ, in which Dafoe starred as Jesus.  Lipton asked the actor what it was like to hang from the cross as Jesus.  Everyone in the audience was on the edge of his or her seat.  Indeed, tell us what it was like to be Jesus?<br /><br />Dafoe answered:  \\"I thought, wow, the sky is so blue.\\"<br /><br />These are experiences that go beyond words.  We know this, but we also trust that words can get us pretty close to the truth of those experiences.<br /><br />In theBible, God himself is the only Creator. I take this to mean that all creative acts come from God. Perhaps that's why we revere the arts the way we do, why we're ever so careful with very old books and the like, and why we take novels like The DaVinci Code so seriously.<br /><br />What is this book about?  You have good versus evil and a chase--in this case a chase for documents that might contain a truth damaging to the power structure of the church--the Roman Catholic Church most obviously but, then again, we're all one big happy family and what affects the Roman Catholic Church will affect all Christians.<br /><br />What is the damaging truth?  That Jesus and Mary Magdalene were married, and this marriage produced a daughter, who married and produced children and on and on right up to the present. Seems there's an extant version of Jesus' family tree to back this up.  This would make a mess of the faith for anyone who believes that Jesus did not participate in normal human activity because he was divine, and divine beings can't in any way be normal.  Anyone in the novel, that is.<br /><br />Back to the chase for documents.  These documents that would corroborate Jesus' fecundity as well as his respect for women and his acceptance of the old-fashioned idea that this little world of ours works best when it's male and female aspects work together equally and in harmony.  That's the other detail.  Mary Magdalene is a controlling stake holder in The Way, the new church.<br /><br />So Brown's book suggests that the Roman Catholic Church over the millennia has made decisions to keep women in subservient roles, right down to its editing of the Bible itself.  The Church has made man the creator and controller of the world, putting itself at odds with the pagan cultures that accept the obvious, that women are the source of life and are the source of creativity.<br /><br />Back to the chase.  It's worth noting that men are preoccupied with this desperate search for documents--to either expose or destroy them to suit a political purpose.  Sophie's along for the ride because her grandfather has been involved in the drama.  She's a cryptologist who can see through the pretenses men set up to protect their interests.<br /><br />Back to those documents.  I'll give it away.  They're never found.  In the end, we have Langdon very near where we can conclude the documents, if they exist, are buried.  But--and here's the exciting end--so what?<br /><br />So what, so what, so what?  The chase that drives this 500-page novel is ostensibly a quest for truth.  Yet that truth can't be found in documents but in our hearts and minds.  Ultimately, the quest is spiritual, personal, and irresolvable in the concrete world we occupy.  So we tell stories.  We discover it isn't all about power but about faith.  For that matter, Robert and Sophie could have stayed home--except that like Jesus himself, they needed that time in the desert to know the truth of their hearts.<br /><br />Back to the adult students in the Advent Bible study.  Last December I visited the Knights of Columbus Museum in New Haven to have a look at the cr?ches from around the world.  I saw the child Jesus born in an alley in Rome among fruit vendors, butchers, and prostitutes.  I saw Him warmed by the breath of donkeys in a Peruvian mountain village.  I saw Him inside a Faberge egg.  I saw Him in an African hut surrounded by people in loin cloths.  He was everywhere reflecting the spiritual reality of his Truth in context.<br /><br />I like the Roman street scene the best because it reminds me that Jesus came to lift us from our poverty of spirit, to teach us to let all rule books be subsumed by love itself, and to live and move with Him in our hearts.  We configure the story according to the world around us--reality--the better to grasp the Truth.<br /><br />I think Brown's book served the Gospel of Jesus very well.  The book challenges some deeply entrenched, self-anointed, self-appointed keepers of the faith to think that maybe there's a chance we don't know everything and we don't even need to.

B000BW7QWW|5.0|Joss said it well, both through his characters and personally, \\"We did the impossible, that makes us mighty.\\" <br /> <br />FOX Television, in a short sighted attempt to cash in on a low budget cop show and reality TV, cut short two great television shows: Firefly and John Doe. <br /> <br />Firefly was a post US Civil War western, set in a Sci-Fi backdrop.  By backdrop, I mean that the technology wasn't the story, it was merely a support aspect of the story.  There was no bouncing an energy beam off the deflector dish to save the day or slingshotting your space craft around the sun to travel in time.  The Sci-Fi was as comfortably placed in the world of Serenity / Firefly as your microwave oven is in real life. <br /> <br />Serenity came about because Joss, the cast and crew, and the fans would not let such a special story die.   <br /> <br />The movie allowed Joss to write a deeper story than he could have within the limits of a television series.  Serenity is deeper, darker, and more emotionally impacting than even Firefly was. <br /> <br />Even the villian has a good reason for being a villian.  He's not two dimensional.  The character was well written and well performed.  You couldn't help but to admire and hate the guy in one thought. <br /> <br />The hero, Captain Mal Reynolds, had to learn a lesson.  He had to regain his faith.  In the series, we learned that he lost his hope and faith after losing the war for freedom from oppression. <br /> <br />The Firefly/Serenity story is one of individual struggle, freedom, and life.  It just happens to be set 500 years in the future and in a different solar system.
B000AWYOGE|4.0|Most viewers will see similarities between this movie and the ring....and those related too it.  Like some of the others, it focuses on mother.....be they good or bad.  This movie offers a lot more depth than many give it credit for.  It could almost be a five star movie except that it does move somewhat slow at some points.  Still, overall it doesn't dissapoint. <br /> <br />The story picks up with a young mother who is recently divorced and is battling her ex-husband for custody.  In addition to this, she must find a decent job, a suitable school in which to send her daughter, and a place to live.  It is the latter where the problem in the story arises. <br /> <br />Connelly's character is forced to take a run down apartment on Roosevelt Island.  The movie nearly always has a gloomy setting with seemingly endless rain and shades of gray.  The high-rise apartment buildings are so impersonal.  As they move in, a dark water stain on the daughter's ceiling is apparent.  This grows as the movie progresses as does her daughters belief in her imaginary friend from upstairs. <br /> <br />Water that is indeed often dark plays a big visual role in the movie.  It is full of powerful symbols and symbolism.  The characters are well developed though some almost go over the edge of being reasonable.  But this adds to the charm of the movie.  The ending could have been better, but overall it was a well written and entertaining ghost story.  I recommend it for the movie and for the many bonus features offered in the DVD.
B000EULJLU|2.0|...when everyone uses either 1 or 5 stars? <br />Tool has become too self absorbed, not only with their 'new-age' spiritual nonsense  <br />but their music as well. The fact that a good portion of Tools fans thought the  <br />leaked release was fake when it was infact the real album speaks volumes. However,  <br />it's not all bad, the first two tracks are quite good, but then a 30min snoarfest of  <br />some half-baked Floyd inspired barbituite of a song takes over. For the love of your  <br />flying spaghetti monster, get back to basics!  <br /> <br />After listening to this album, I can only wonder..will the next Tool release be hardcover? <br /> <br />For any aliens reading this... the next time you abduct one of Tools members, keep them!
B000EGF0B4|1.0|I do not see what the excitement is about this movie.  To me it was boring.  Maybe some folks are happy to see a movie about guys in manly jobs that are bi-sexual. To some this may be a novelty but to me it is a snore. The only thing this movie has going for it as far as I can see is the beautiful photography which can be seen in other movies or a good educational television station.  All these men did in the end is wind up hurting women.  Why did they get married anyhow?  Oh well.  I rented the DVD to see what all the fuss is about,.  No big whoop.  Save your money.
B000EULJLU|3.0|I am amazed at how much this album leaves me wanting so much more. Lateralus was an absolute masterpiece, comparitively this sounds more like a b-sides Lateralus. Never before has the band been so uninspiring and repetitive. <br /> <br />Obviously TOOL is known for using bits and pieces to fill the gaps between songs, and it has always worked very well... until now. 15+ minutes of annoying filler is complete BS. The non song tracks are a far cry from the interesting/mind blowing/funny/clever pieces we have come to enjoy over the previous 4 releases. And if you were expecting something exciting to end the album with, feel free to turn this one off after track 10. The album's conclusion is 5+ minutes of utter nothingness.  <br /> <br />I hate to say it but this is the first time I have felt TOOL sounds like someone else and not the other way around. If you have heard Pain of Salvation then you know what I am talking about. This album would be somewhat good coming from someone else, but coming from one of the greatest bands of all time it is sadly disappointing. <br /> <br />Dont get me wrong, there is a decent amount of good music here, particularly in the first half of the CD. But if you had been waiting on your toes for 5 years for this one, prepare to fall flat on your face.  <br /> <br />TOOL has been my favorite band for a decade, and they will probably continue to be among my favorites, but this is easily their weakest effort. Anyone who says this album is anywhere near up to par with what the band is capable of is only fooling themselves. <br /> <br />Hopefully next time they focus more on the music and less on the CD packaging.
B000EULJLU|5.0|This is a concept album, emphatically going in one direction. but you don't notice it at first coz the fall is in spiral and  goes beyond the unexpected. complex in ideas, subtly elaborated, progressive, totaly out of trend, no for everyone. if you are planning to buy a CD to dance in a party this is not your choice.<br /><br />therefore if you are Familiar w/ Lateralus and you like it don't ever hesitate to buy this one. is a must for you.
B0001CCXZW|3.0|i though that this was a great way to start out for a new tv show. At first i did not watch until about the third season and now i can not stop. and it is at a great price to buy it. nowhere else you can get it for this price, only here.
B000002B1M|5.0|Everyone and their mother has reviewd this disc at length.  Let me just say a few things.  This album is classic, one of the best hardcore records of all time.  Production is on point and Nas rips most every track.  \\"I gave you power\\" may be the most original track ever.  This album will go down as one of the best hardcore hip-hop discs of all time.  If for some freakish reason you have never heard it, get it now, you'll be impressed.  Personally, I think Nas fell of big time after this release, and has never come close to recapturing his brilliance.  This seems to happen to every solid act that hits it big in the mainstream.   <br /> <br />TOP TRACKS. <br />-I Gave You Power <br />-Shootouts <br />-Affirmative Action <br />-The Message
B000EULJLU|1.0|Ok I am going to do something I thought I would never do I am going to bash a tool album.  This is by far the worst tool album ever.  I have loved tool since there first album and I couldn't believe they made me wait 5 years for this garbage.  Maynard is almost totally absent on the album and when he does sing it is weak and pathetic.  I guess those years with a perfect circle just took every last bit of talent he had left.  If this is the quality of music tool is going to make now they should just break up and save them selves the embarrestment.  If I wanted a crappy perfect circle album I would have bought one.  It is truly a sad day for those of us who actually thought tool would just keep saving the day.
B000ENWKN8|5.0|I don't care wether this sounds like an exaggeration: Rob Zombie's \\"Educated Horses\\" is (at least to me it is) this year's best rock record! And, to be consequent, it's probably the best one since Down's second album (2002). <br />The unique atmosphere and intensity Zombie and his band are creating in such a short running time (less than 40 minutes!)are awesome.  <br />The reduced sound - less electro stuff, less sampling, but more excellent guitar work instead - suits them well. <br />I also think that \\"horses\\" is not only the best rock album within four years but the best Zombie-album since \\"Astro-Creep 2000\\" and the feeling of the new album is very much the same like the one of White Zombie's song \\"Blood, Milk and Sky\\" which is one of Zombie's best songs ever.  <br />One should also praise John5 for getting rid of the Marilyn MAnson-conventions! I never heard such a great guitar-play from him like his stuff on \\"Horses\\". <br />Great stuff!!! <br />
B000ETQRCM|5.0|Ok, so you've heard the reviews, \\"The best PJ album in 10 years\\" Rolling Stone, etc.  I'm  <br /> <br />always skeptical when I hear these statements.  Having been a fan since Ten, I've been  <br /> <br />dissapointed with their progress ever since No Code was released.  I liked Yield (which by  <br /> <br />the way is probably their most underrated album) but on the whole they haven't done much in  <br /> <br />a while.  This album kicked me back in time.  Once the first track \\"Life Wasted\\" started it  <br /> <br />suddenly brought back memories of huddling over the fold-out poster of Ten reading the  <br /> <br />lyrics and consuming the entire album.  Pearl Jam is back. <br /> <br />The next 4 songs are a kick in the face.  It's the Pearl Jam of old.  Straight up rock.   <br /> <br />\\"World Wide Suicide\\" is next, a likely single for it's hook and political message.  You'll  <br /> <br />notice a lot of political lyrics on this album if you read the them in the booklet.  <br /> <br />However, just listening to the CD, you don't really get this sense at all.  Great song.   <br /> <br />\\"Comatose\\" is next and draws parrellels to Spin the Black Circle...probably my least  <br /> <br />favorite PJ song of all time.  \\"Severed Hand\\" comes next and after reading the reviews, I  <br /> <br />was surprised to see this as people's favorites.  Honestly  it's a good song but not even  <br /> <br />close the the best on the album.  The melodies come out in the end..you'll know once you  <br /> <br />think your fire alarm is going off :)  Then it heads into classic rock guitar that I was so  <br /> <br />glad to see back in the mix. <br /> <br />\\"Marker in the Sand\\" is next song and this is the point where I sat back and realized that  <br /> <br />this album is going to be huge.  The simplicity in the guitar work is the only thing that  <br /> <br />detracts from the song after the amazing guitar ending of track 4, but the chorus just made  <br /> <br />me say wow...radio maybe?   <br /> <br />\\"Parachutes\\" comes next and it absolutly beautiful.  A true breather and a great place in  <br /> <br />the album.  Once you listen to the entire thing the whole way through you'll understand how  <br /> <br />thoughtful it was put together.  However, each song still is able to stand alone.  <br /> <br />\\"Unemployable\\" is a mid-tempo straight up rock song.  If you don't like this song, you  <br /> <br />won't like any PJ song.  I could see this on radio too, but since it was released with  <br /> <br />\\"WWS\\" the PJ track record shows it probably wont see radio play..too bad. <br /> <br />Then \\"Big Wave\\" kicks in and reminds you that you're listening to a rock record.  Stright  <br /> <br />up simple no bells and whistles rock.  This song will def. pump you up for anything.   <br /> <br />Really brings life back into the album. <br /> <br />\\"Gone\\" is epic.  I don't know what else to say.  Where has PJ been all these years?  If you  <br /> <br />wondered, you need not anymore.  It's a true song of the times.  As is most of this album.   <br /> <br />If Iraq is out Vietnam, Vedder is our Dylan and doesn't dissapoint.  Can I say wow again? <br /> <br />\\"Wasted Reprise\\" is not really a song (a reprise of Life Wasted), but it's cool.  PJ always  <br /> <br />has a song like this on their albums. <br /> <br />\\"Army Reserve\\" reminded me a lot of a U2 song.  I really like it.  Rock and very melodic.   <br /> <br />Very Cool.  \\"Come Back\\" is a slow song and reminds me of a lullaby.  Full of soul and  <br /> <br />emotion.  A nice ease into their final song, \\"Inside Job\\".  The beginning of the song  <br /> <br />reminds me of Pink Floyd intro.  Haunting and familiar yet, I can't seem to place it...   <br /> <br />The song then escaltes like Stairway to Heaven into another epic masterpiece.  A great  <br /> <br />ending to a revolutionary album of our time.  Although they never truly went anywhere, PJ  <br /> <br />is back and no one can argue with that.  Vedder has his mojo back.
B000EMGAGW|2.0|I'll be the first to say it, this is the worst Mobb Deep album. That's not sayin it ain't better than alot of other mainstream hip hop releases, but def their worst.
1594200106|2.0|The comparisons to Borges, Eco, Auster, and Marquez, are what drew me into this novel. But it's my own fault, really, for allowing critics' hyperbolic and ultimately hollow praise to impact my literary choices. Typically I choose novels based on their own merits rather than on what critics think; remind me to revert to that habit next time I'm at the bookstore.<br /><br />It's not that it's a bad novel, really; for a mass audience, I suppose it's pretty decent. But I am a haughty sort when it comes to reading, and I'm not ashamed to acknolwedge my proclivity for richer tomes. I like dense, complex, philosophical literature, the sort churned out by the above-named authors. In other words, King and Grisham are not invited guests to my library. I have read plenty of Marquez, some Auster and Borges, and one novel and several essays by Eco. And Shadow of the Wind comes nowhere close to mimicking the superior styles of these scribes.<br /><br />What bothers me the most about this book is its concession to poorly placed humor. I don't mind humor in literature, but only when it's well-placed - when the context justifies it. Marquez, Borges and Eco have a subtle execution with humor, but Zafron's use of it is too obvious and pandering. I wanted more of the creepy horror, but Zafron seems intent on resorting to incongruous lighthearted \\"comical\\" flashes. These moments do nothing but distract from a potentially interesting story.<br /><br />The story also suffers from mediocre writing and an unjustified lengthiness.<br /><br />The novel's positive points lie in a few intriguing plot twists, and decent character development.<br /><br />If eerie, mystical horror is what you seek, check out Lovecraft; if ethereal magic realism is what you seek, check out Marquez. And if you prefer convoluted plots, philosophical rumination, and literary description to tepid, high schoolish prose, check out those authors, plus Auster and Eco.<br /><br />Oh, and don't listen to critics - even me.itics - even me.  <br /> <br />
B000EULJLU|2.0|Come on Tool Zealots, this is Mediocre at best, just like Lateralus.  What I hear on 10,000 Days, and Lateralus, is four musicians standing at the front of the stage, all doing solos at the same time and trying to one-up each other.  The lyrics and Maynard's voice have become melodramatic.  The only time they sound good on this latest album is in the song \\"The Pot.\\"  In this song Maynard does sound good with his new style, and the instrumentation is not meandering individually, each looking for the limelight.  Otherwise, they are trying to be too sophisticated, too deep.  In my opinion their best was undertow and Aenima; Aenima being one of the best albums of all time. <br /> <br />In short, they have sacrificed their edge for melodrama <br />
0226264211|5.0|Milton Friedman, now approaching 94 has for his entire lifetime been the vanguard of freedom in academia. \\"Capitalism and Freedom\\" dispels the so-called myths about capitalism that have become prevalent in society. The book was orignally writen in 1962 so that is the era in which his point are made. However, they are points that never go out of sytle. He refutes the lie that the free-market caused the depression (it was actually a tyrannical Federal Reserve), that socialism can be democratic, and others. Friedman discusses public education, roads, minimum wage laws (which he calls, \\"the most anti-black law on the books,\\"), as well as the how so-called \\"progressive\\" tax system and welfare actually hurt the poor.    Please understand that Friedman is NOT a \\"right-wing\\" extremist as some knucklehead below states. He is a libertarian. He developed the idea of the negative income tax to help the poor. His ideas were to help people not hurt them with the free-market. Someone who says otherwise doesn't know what they're talking about.
B00005MP58|4.0|This BBC TV miniseries was a hit from the beginning - it stayed true to the plotline of the novel, the actors were excellent (need I mention the droolworthy Mr. Darcy?), it had the right period setting and atmosphere, and it had great dialogue and music.  <br /> <br />I did have a bit of a problem with the color in this version, because at times it seemed slightly washed out, but otherwise the resolution is okay. The special features are nice, and it's lovely to watch the entire story for - what, four hours straight? Jane Austen fans, this is something you should definitely consider buying!
0670034711|2.0|This book starts out wonderfully.  The writer is smart, funny, and the woman can write!  She says, early on in her travels, that she can make friends with anyone, and you believe her because she is so engaging and vibrant, and her stories are compelling and fun to read.  You are willing to listen to her say just about anything because she says it in such an entertaining way.  But somewhere, in the middle of the book I started to get tired of the stories.  Everything works out, nothing goes wrong, and there appears to be very little true soul searching below the surface.  The book is being hailed as a spiritual journal, but it really never gets below the veneer of anecdotes.  The author is good company, but her journey is ultimately disappointing.
1572814349|5.0|I agree with other reviewers in this space that Golden Tarot is a gorgeous piece of work, with obvious care and regard powering its smart, seamless execution. The International Gothic collages and accompanying booklet will inspire anyone who loves art and meaning, not just Tarot enthusiasts. <br /> <br />I enjoy having the Golden Tarot out on the coffee table-- like an art book, but I prefer this format.  Being able to play with and interpret new juxtapositions of the deck's evocative, meaning-laden images enables a brain-jogging, interactive experience that bound, sequential art books cannot provide-- unless you cut them up, but who wants to do that? <br /> <br />Also, it takes up much less room...
1400079179|4.0|I've got mixed feelings about the Da Vinci Code, yes it was definitely a page turner and unlike some people who said it had a slow start, was hooked from page one. However, I was very disappointed by the end and of course you don't read a book like this and expect it to have incredible 3 dimensional characters. He is an excellent storyteller and I really think he made his viewpoint on the story of Jesus believable whether it's actually true or not, I don't know. But why the heck not, he states his case well.  If you're looking for a page turner, go for it but I hope you won't be as disappointed about the end as I was.<br /><br />Jeff Rivera<br /><br />Author of FOREVER MY LADY on Amazon.com
B000FGGE68|5.0|I loved Equilibrium and therefore loved this film, which is essentially the director's version of Equilibrium with evolved concepts from that film and featuring the directors take on what makes life meaning for a girl rather than a guy.  Incidently, the answer of course is the same--a life without love is not a life at all.  You are just waiting to die.  I thought that was really neat. <br /> <br />Anyway, this is no Oscar contender (nor was Equilibrium) but it is very slick and features some very interesting premises on the future.  The art direction is gorgeous and the use of white light really helps to convey the sterility of this future world. <br /> <br />The villain is interesting and entertainingly played by the actor.  I loved the showdown at the end. <br /> <br />Milla does such an amazing job.  We have seen her do physical stuff before so that is no stretch.  However, what makes her performance here so singular is the emotion she brings to the character and the fact that she is allowed to be beautiful and more feminine.  All the toughness and such are there as well, but this time her character is more balanced. <br /> <br />I loved the concepts, music, and special effects of the film.  I am glad that they looked different.  I hate it when things are cookie cutter effects-wise.  Thus I appreciated this film's highly stylized vision of the future and of fighting.   <br /> <br />A fun diversion.
B000EULJLU|5.0|I never liked any new Tool album until listening to it for about a month, then after they sank in, I loved them all. I predict the same for this album. The music and songs are too complex to grasp in just one or two listens in my opinion. Be patient. On a side note, it was surprising to actually see portraits of the band- they always made a point of not showing themselves, even minimizing your view of them live.
B000EOTAM6|5.0|Fans of the shorts and serial AEON FLUX have been given a gift.  From the film's first frames, it pays homage to the style and design sense of the show.  The title card format that introduced each episode is there.  The trademark fly buzzing about gets a new take as well.  Many of the scenes, poses, settings, weapons, outfits, and dialogue styles of the show make it into the film-and flawlessly.  Having totally loved the AEON FLUX show, I was really surprised and pleased by how much effort went into translating so much of it to the live action version. <br /> <br />Even Aeon's signature tumbling-as-evasive-action and weird leaping is in there.   <br /> <br />Now if you are not a fan of the show, but like Sci-Fi, there is much to enjoy here as well.  I am most pleased that the action and tech in the film never feels overdone or gratuitous, but rather both are employed always to serve the story.   <br /> <br />A very refreshing film.  But as an adaptation, it is off the charts with how well it treats the source material.  Amazing! <br />
0307276902|1.0|I purchased this book based on Oprah's recommendation and because I am intimately familiar with addiction, having come from a family of addicts. I didn't get to the mid-section of this book before I put it down.  It was unmitigated garbage.  I just knew that the stories were not true or at the very least embellished.  When the true story came out I was not the least bit surprised.  I gave the book to Goodwill and Good Ridance as far as I am concerned.  The author does not deserve to profit from this, but of course he has. <br /> <br />
B000EMGAGW|3.0|I give this album an overall B-.  The first reason is, the album could've been at least an extra 5 tracks longer, the CEO was dilluting the album like another Puff Daddy, and the third reason is, there are two songs on the album that didn't need to be on there!  I mean \\"Outta Control\\" got it's respected air play, last year; the other thing is \\"Havin a Party\\", could've stayed at home with the Get Rich or Die Tryin Sdtk.  My other big disappointment to this album will probably share the same opinion along w/ other fans, was that @ least Big Noyd, did not make it to the album; which for me is a blind-side kick to the nuts of all Mobb fans.  I'm not sure how this comment will be taken if read by anyone in charge of putting this album together; but for the record, the album is good, however it could've been better than what it is just to feed a majority of hunger for their anticipation.
B000AMJG4Y|5.0|First off let me say just how amazing the Final Fantasy VII game really is. Over 5 years after its release there are still people talking of it and interested in it. Just look at this dvd which is ranked #1 on Amazon as proof...<br /><br />This movie is beyond beatiful. The cg artwork and graphics in it are beyond stunning. I have never seen cg work as impressive and seemless as this anywhere else. The work is truly jaw dropping.<br /><br />And the battle scenes. Oh what a joy!<br /><br />Seeing every character give Cloud a 'boost' during the bahamut battle was awesome. And that finishing move vs Sephiroth will put a smile on your face. The battles were a pure joy to behold.<br /><br />The story was a decent one but it was nothing too shocking. They clearly went for action over storyline in this movie but it doesnt seem to make it any worse for it.<br /><br />You will definitely be lost if you havent already played Final Fantasy VII. Though there is a handy little movie summary of the Final Fantasy VII game on the dvd.<br /><br />This movie has been in the works for years and brought some tremendous hype along with it. Well, after the long wait i must say that it was definitely worth it.
B000EHRVP6|3.0|I really wasn't sure if I was going to like this movie during the first 40 minutes!!!!  It was all sex, and drugs, and it just needed to get on with it!!!  But once it did, it got awesome!!!  Very graphic torture scenes, but I don't think they went too far with it.  I thought it was a good film, though.  No well known actors, but the movie was still pretty good.  It will keep u on the edge of your seat to see who will survive, and how much they will go thru to survive!!!!  This is a must see if u like the gory suspenseful movies.  Kind of like the Saw movies!!!!
B00005JOYA|4.0|as a fan of the game series, I was very sceptical when I heard that this movie was being made. As a huge Resident Evil fan, I was very dissapointed with the movie as an adaption, so I was very cautious, not expecting much...<br /><br />Silent Hill brings a new meaning to the word CREEPY. Its marvelous atmosphere helps sell the horror, and the monsters, while most not in the games, are true to the nature of the creatures from the video game franchise. The story deviates slightly overall from the game's but for the most part the themes are identical. Many of the characters in the movie are true to their video game counterparts...<br /><br />Overall I reccomend this movie as not only an entertaining horror movie, but as one of the best game to film adaptions I have seen so far...
0307277674|3.0|I guess I'm one of those people who are looking for a rare gem to read, and was fooled into thinking I had found that gem. After all, how can 40 million readers be wrong? The DaVinci Code doesn't really deserve to be this successful, as it is not very original in its language, or truly spellbinding. The positive thing: I finally found that gem I was looking for. Creator, by Michael A. Hills, also deals with an alternative Jesus reality, yet this book is written par excellence. For most people the DaVinci Code is sufficient entertainment. Those looking for precious things though will have to look else where.
B000006V31|5.0|Gotta say, i've lately been mining the early 70's heavy material via Poppoff's Collectors Guide to Heavy Metal, the 70s ed., and only happened to notice this one cuz it came right before Led Zep.  The description intrigued me, and I was familiar with Peter French from Cactus (which I like) so I gave it a shot.  Usually, when you hope for the great lost rock classic it just doesn't live up; Leafhound truly does.  Shades of Zep I and II, a touch of \\"Smokin\\" era Humble Pie, maybe a little Free as well; good solid riff based guitar playing, great vocals.  I was very very pleased when I put it on and pretty much the Whole Thing is consistent from the first track on.  If you like the early 70s stuff that's half riffy boogie rock and half proto-metal then this is a truly good buy.
B000EULJLU|5.0|Yet another classic entry from Tool. Pretty much everything has already been said about the merits of this album. The harder songs like Jambi, Vicarious, the Pot, and Rosetta Stoned meld really well with \\"softer\\" and more ambient songs like intension, and the brilliant Wings For Marie part 1 and 2. Right In Two is also a great song. This album probably has a greater array of emotions represented than any of their previous works. Gets better with every listen, and I can not FRIGGEN wait to hear this material on tour with all the old Tool classics.
B000EULJLU|2.0|I have loved Tool since there first album.  It seems to me that since the birth of A Perfect Circle, the aggressive and dynamic sound of Tool as slowly dwindled away.  Of course, this is my opinion, since I like heavier music.  Lateralus, to me, was a huge let down.  Very long and boring, except for Schism, Ticks and Leeches, The Grudge.  I read online that this album was going to be heavier than Lateralus.  I was very excited when I heard this and looked forward to the new album.  Sad to say, this album is anything but heavy.  Don't get me wrong, I do like Vicarious and Jambi, but that's it.  2 songs on the whole album.  Half of the album is soundscapes and instrumental.  The other songs are long, slow, and boring.  I wanted to like this album as much as anyone else, but I just can't.  I guess all the qualities I loved about Tool in their first 3 albums are no more.  Sad but true.  Just my opinion.
B000B8QG0O|4.0|Here's yet one more sequel that more than lived up to its original great start. The first Toy Story was outstanding. This is just as good, if not better.Very fast-paced and very entertaining, this doesn't have a lot of laugh-out-loud parts but is definitely fun to watch with many good lines. What I appreciated was the lack of a nasty villain and any evil overtones, as was the case with the rotten neighborhood kid in the first film. <br /> <br />I also appreciated the fantastic surround sound on the DVD (any of the Toy Story DVDs are great, by the way), along with the magnificent colors. Not to be forgotten is a wonderful, tear-jerking song in here, sung by Sarah MacLaclan. It gets to me every time. <br /> <br />When you factor in all the nice characters, music, colors and sounds, this has to be one of the most beloved animated films of the modern era.  <br />
0380789035|4.0|I thought that this story was an interesting read...exciting in some places, pensive in others.  IMO, I thought there were a few things which could've been improved - more interaction/activity with the various Gods/Goddesses...better explanations as to why certain things were the way they were (i.e. Horus being crazy, etc.)...and did Shadow ever have an emotion?  I must've missed it if he did.  He accepted things...bizarre things so matter-of-factly that it seemed a bit false.  Like the whole thing with his deceased wife...any regular person would've been scared sh*tless at first.  Anyway, without getting too \\"wordy\\"...a worthwile read, but it could've been better.
630529142X|5.0|I have to admit: this Adam Sandler no-brainer is hilarious, just had me laughing right from the start. I'd rank it in my top ten funny movies of my collection and it features one of my favorite characters in film: Bobby Boucher Jr., a heckuva lot nicer guy than Sandler's \\"Happy Gilmore.\\"  <br /> <br />\\"Bobby\\" is about as innocent and a gentle-natured a guy as you'll find this side of Forrest Gump. You can't help but root for him, and that's the idea. What the film basically involves is another \\"Revenge Of The Nerds\\" theme except it's \\"nerd \\"- singular - as the picked-on waterboy turning the tables on the football jocks. Interesting to once again see Jerry Reed, whom I haven't seen much of since his days in \\"Smokey And The Bandit.\\" He has much fatter face but everything else looked the same. Then there is Henry Winkler, \\"The Fonz\\" who now is the opposite: a guy with a terrible inferiority complex. All the characters in here are wildly exaggerated. <br /> <br />This cartoon-like comedy may not be high-brow, but so what? It's not totally low- brow either, but I do wonder why modern filmmakers cannot seem to make a comedy without all the sex references and the profanity. Nonetheless, Sandler's Cajun accent, his strange-looking-but pretty girlfriend (Fairuza Balk) and crazy mother (Kathy Bates, in the funniest role she's ever played) are all great fun to watch. <br /> <br />It's silly, particularly the ridiculous climactic football game, but then this movie is hardly to be taken seriously. It's all absurd humor,and 90 minutes was just right amount of time for it.  <br />
B000ETQRCM|5.0|Pearl Jam always been an inspiration to millions of fans since before the album \\"Ten\\" was released. \\"Marker in the sand\\" and \\" inside job\\" will fill your soul on this album. Every single song ever written by this band is poetic,real, and from who they are. They are not looking to be on the pop charts, they don't care about people accusing or judging them for not writing or playing music \\"Society\\" wants them to play. In my opinion, I think every Pearl Jam album  should be noted as a 5 Star peformance. From songs like,\\"Release\\" and \\"Out of my Mind\\" I have enjoyed every single song ever written and performed by this band. I ask the the critics \\"How can YOU say comeback\\"? Pearl Jam has NEVER left and will always be \\"true to their fans\\".
B000EHSVOG|4.0|\\"Disaster Movies\\" were a big hit in the era this came out, with airplane crashes, earthquakes, fires, etc. This one made huge fires and firemen fashionable for awhile. It certainly had people talking, and it may have been the best of those \\"disaster\\" flicks. <br /> <br />The movie certainly had an all-star cast: Paul Newman, Steve McQueen, William Holden, Faye Dunaway, Fred Astaire, Susan Blakely, Richard Chamberlain, Robert Vaughn, Robert Wagner and (gulp) O.J. Simpson. Even Jennifer Jones came out of a long retirement to return to films. It was really nice to see her again. <br /> <br />What really surprised me about this film when I watched it earlier this year was that the special effects were still good, and the film is almost 40 years old. It was also good to see Steve McQueen being the good guy again. He was the best character in the film. The worst was William Holden, who turned out to play a lot profane-spewing nasty people as soon as the Hays' code was totally abolished in 1967. Same thing for Paul Newman.  However, McQueen kept his class as did Jones, of course, and Astaire. <br /> <br />The film is almost three hours long but, a few soap opera scenes aside, it's a solid adventure story that holds up well and it served a good purpose, making hotel owners more aware of potential fire hazards.  <br />
B000EULJLU|4.0|There were about six REAL standout songs on the cd, with Vicarious being the favorite.  I rank that song with Tool's best.  I also really enjoyed Jambi, The Pot, Rosetta Stoned and Right In Two.  There were definitely weak spots, but with Aenima, I had to play that several times before it clicked big time.  Maybe it will happen again, maybe not.  Still, this is Tool.  One of my favorites releases this year.  Can hardly wait to see them live later this summer.
B000000OQ5|5.0|Few \\"metal\\" bands can successfully integrate melody into their music without falling back on the overused \\"power ballad\\". Tesla seems to be able to turn it on when needed, and shut it off when unnecessary. This debut from the Sacramento quintet is full of enough speed to satisfy any metalhead, yet also contains enough substance to satisfy those who want more from their rock than double kicks and 140 on the metronome. <br /> <br />The album starts off with a great rythym section groove, then growing and ripping into EZ Cum EZ Go, a song that takes the listener up and down more often than a Valencia theme park ride. Comin' Atcha Live seems destined to be the song that the band opens their live shows with, falling back into the rif-filled melodic offering of \\"Getting Better\\". Then the pace swells again into \\"Too Late For Love\\", and thunders into the anthemic fist-pumping \\"Rock Me To The Top\\". \\"We're No Good Together\\" may start like the dreaded power ballad as Jeff Keith laments about the proverbial one that got away, but screams to a conclusion through a profusion of lightning fast (pun intended) guitar solos. \\"Modern Day Cowboy\\" is the token political anti-war statement, slows down a bit for \\"Changes\\" but up next is one of their fans' favorites. \\"Little Suzi\\" begins with a tasty acoustic piece, and progresses into the culmination of the bands' melodic songwriting talents as they chronical the ups and downs (pun intended) of a young starlet discovering the high costs of fame. I'm a little surprised at the way the album closes, though. After the huge highs through the middle of the album, the final three cuts are somewhat disappointing to me. Don't get me wrong,  they're still decent, but I would have liked these three shifted to the middle of the album and slid the rest towards the end - \\"Little Suzi\\" would have been a great way to end the album. Overall, even though the band did a lot of great stuff (including their biggest commercial success) in later albums, this remains their best body of work.
B0000931QA|5.0|MTV Rocks is the biggest idiot ever! He bashes on this classic masterpiece and yet he says that a real concept album is Usher's \\"Confessions\\"! What the hell! He also says that this album sucks because it wasn't played on MTV or a Top 40 station but who gives a fu**?! He also says that Avril LOSERlaving and Lindsey HOEhan are \\"da bestest gatar plyas eva!!!!!!!!\\" That's so untrue! MTV Rocks sucks and always will!!!<br /><br />Okay on to the album. This is one of metal's best concept albums ever right up there with King Diamond's \\"Abigail\\" and Iron Maiden's \\"Seventh Son of a Seventh Son\\". The storyline is about a guy named Nikki who gets brainwashed by the evil Dr. X. He makes Nikki do bad things like develop a drug addiction. Then Dr. X tells Nikki to kill a politican, his girlfriend, and a priest. Will Nikki be able to overcome the evil Dr. X?! Listen to the album and find out...<br /><br />The album's great! The vocals, guitars, synths etc. are all perfect! MTV Rocks is a complete idiot and he should delete his fu**ing account! This is truly one of metal's best albums and is a classic not to be missed!
B000EULJLU|5.0|I dont know what all these haters are talkin about, this album is great, its heavy, progressive, everythng u want from tool. adam jones is awesome, he has a never before heard sound on this album, well on every album tool has made, hes just even better now.  It exceeded my expectations.  Dont listen to these haters, they obviously wouldnt know what good music is.
0800130928|5.0|If any DVD needed a commentary its this one!!!   <br />So Martin Scorcese if yur reading this please do a Commentary !!! <br />This movie is a classic and there are some scenes that are subject to interpretation.  I particuarly enjoyed the previous review which states that the ending is a dream sequence. Very well done. I must admit that ending always left me confused. Since a commentary is almost commonplace on new releases--its definately time to re-release Taxi Driver
B00005JOFQ|5.0|The world has suffered too much from people without depths and intelligence, and after I read some of the reviews, I felt that I must counter Plom de Nume \\"Rob\\" so that others with intelligence and depth should shine <br /> <br />His view of the movie can be categorized by many reviewers before as incorrect, prejudged, and shallow. But instead of pointing back at all the positive reviewer's comment to demonstrate his integrity, let's go right into his test. <br /> <br />Do we want to watch Brokeback Mountain over 3 times. The answer is Yes. In fact, my family, and friends, and just about everyone I know watched this movie at least 5 times in theatre, and have all bought the DVD release. On the other hand, Crash, though won the award, did not generate the same feeling. In fact, I was ready to pack the movie and ditch it within 30 minutes. The movie talks about contraversy in racism, but where's the depth, the emotional connection, the spiritual value? All it does is repeat the American wave of racism over and over again. <br /> <br />If you have not already done so, go to the store, and buy this movie. This is absolutely the best movie you will ever see, as long as you are smart and have depth. Nevermind what shallow people like Plom de Nume say about this movie. Their review alone is enough to demonstrate their lack of integrity.
B000ETQRCM|5.0|Love this CD.  I`ve loved Pearl Jam forever but was kind of turned off by the uneventful sound of Riot Act as it all just kind of blended together and really had no relevance today.  The new album is the exact opposite.  Beautiful music, great lyrics and song that are crafted apart from one another while still carrying a thread that connects the album.  Severed Hand, great song.  Unemployable, probably one of their bests.  Army Reserve, great, Come Back, beautiful, Inside Job haunting and gorgeous.<br /><br />You can finally understand what Eddie is saying and his lyrics mean something rather than just words mumbled together.  The music is more complex but still catchy. Definatly similar to VS and Vitalogy but not sounding dated, they`ve stepped up their music and are current.  You`ll love it!
B000EULJLU|5.0|I don't understand all these tool \\"fans\\" saying they need more than one listen to get into this album- this is Tool- let it take you.  This album is amazing (and yes, I've been a fan since Opiate)- just take it in and enjoy.
B00080ZG10|5.0|I at least hope not.  All of the reviews are very good on here, but I have to be honest, this is one of my top 10 favorite movies of all-time.  I have never been a leonardo fan, until now.  I will be reviewing the 2-disc edition here.<br /><br />The movie itself is wonderful in showing us a GOOD version of the howard hughes story.  the commentary does a lot of explaining hwo you can't tell a 100% true life story of a this guy, so they took facts and built on that to make this movie.  They go over many historical events and seem to hit many of the good ones.  But leonardo's portrayal is magnificent.  Not only is he perfect for the young free spending howard, but also for the older role.  There is a wonderful part in the movie that is showing you just how crazy this guy is.  He sees a dirty janitor cleaning, howard asks somebody if that guy works for him, he tells the guy to fire him.  I thought it was a great part, but the commentary gives you great insight of how he was supposed to be seeing himself years from now all dirty and stuff.  It doesn't make the movie any better, but it is always good to have an understanding.  So it would take to long to go over this long ass movie, but it is awesome and I have to say that the court scene is definitely one of my favorite scenes in cinema history.<br /><br />The commentary is pretty good, btu not enough talking, not coherent enough, and A LOT of repeated stuff from the interviews.<br /><br />And all of the interviews and documentaries are well worth watching.  There is also a lot of stuff on the miniatures and how they got the action scenes to screen.  Also costume and music featurettes.  Overall the extras get a 4/5, it's just I can't rate the extras anywhere near the actual movie, it is truly inspiring.
B000EBD9TY|5.0|*WARNING: May contain spoilers.* <br /> <br />A Streetcar Named Desire is a fascinating film for a lot of reasons. It's very difficult for me to compose my thoughts on this film, as there are just so many things happening on so many different levels. <br /> <br />I suppose I'll begin with the element that really makes the film what it is: the one and only Elia Kazan. For some reason these days, Kazan's films seem to get labeled as outdated and heavy-handed. I can understand why one might think that about Boomerang! or Gentleman's Agreement (though I think those are both very good films, especially the latter), but there is certainly nothing outdated or heavy-handed about A Streetcar Named Desire. It is one of the subtlest and most well crafted films I have ever seen. <br /> <br />The story concerns aging southern belle Blanche DuBois (Leigh), who moves to New Orleans to stay with her younger sister Stella (Hunter) and finds a culture clash at every corner, especially with Stella's \\"unrefined\\" husband Stanley, who is played by a very sexy Marlon Brando. <br /> <br />It is extraordinarily interesting to see the juxtaposition between Vivien Leigh and Marlon Brando. Leigh is an old-fashioned, classical actress of the highest order, charming the audience with her sunny disposition and perky smile, though she definitely has a dark side. Then we have Brando, a young, up-and-coming user of the rising art of method acting. It is one of the most interesting on-screen interactions one is likely to see. <br /> <br />What is also very interesting is watching Blanche's slow spiral into insanity. All of the elegance and wealth she grew up in is gone, and she has done unthinkable things to survive. Now she is stuck in a New Orleans slum with a sweaty simpleton yelling at her. Pair that with the tormenting suicide of a past lover, and you have a recipe for madness. <br /> <br />Being based on a Tennessee Williams play, the film takes place in essentially one location, that being Stella and Stanley's apartment, but Kazan utilizes the New Orleans locale to perfection, and the combination of his direction, the gorgeous, glowing black and white cinematography, and Alex North's sultry, jazzy score gives the film a consistently surreal, almost dreamlike atmosphere. <br /> <br />But more notably, the New Orleans atmosphere gives Kazan the perfect opportunity to play with the story's sensual aspects, and he occasionally even delves into pure primal sexuality, such as in the famous \\"Stella!\\" scene. The film is so subtly steamy and wrought with sexual tension that it pushed the boundaries of censorship back in its day. This also may be due to the fact that it alludes to some very controversial subjects. This is another point at which the film's subtlety becomes a marvel of cinematic engineering. Was Blanche's lover homosexual? Did Stanley rape Blanche? There are no solid answers to these questions - it is left for the viewer to decide. <br /> <br />But as I first mentioned, the real virtuoso behind this film is Elia Kazan. Some people may still be upset over his actions during the Red Scare, but it is undeniable that he made some extremely good films. A Streetcar Named Desire is one of his absolute finest masterpieces. It was very much ahead of its time, and it remains one of the most intense, subtle, and well-made dramas in the history of film.
B000EULJLU|4.0|I enjoy how everyone prefaces their review with \\"Look I'm a tool fan...\\"  So to be part of the group, I have listened to Tool since Opiate, and I'm old enough to know that 4-5 years makes a huge psychological difference.  These guys have been putting out Albums for fifteen years.  Keep in mind, there are only four full length studio albums.  Undertow came out in 1993. <br /> <br />All of these musicians have other \\"Jobs\\" so Tool is a labor of love.  I'm pretty sure they have gone beyond the whole process of trying to please fans, and lean more towards enjoying the fact that people can grow to understand and enjoy their music.  Of course, I only assume, I am not the band. <br /> <br />All this said, although each album is significantly different from the previous one, there is a methodology to the evolution.  I don't fully have my entire head around this album yet, but I understand the progression.  If you jump from Undertow to here, it's hard to recognize the band.  But then again, when I first got Aenima and played it for some people who liked undertow, they didn't like it either. <br /> <br />The Album:  It is deep and layered and has moments of uncharacteristic vocalization for Maynard.  He seems to toy with styles and emotions different for him, not only with Tool but his career in general.  But keep in mind, Tool is not about Maynard.  His voice is an instrument, and always has been.  The method with which he attacks this role has just evolved with the rest of the band. <br /> <br />So far as I can tell, this is not a perfect album.  It is however strong and admirable.  There are moments of musical self indulgence, that appear take away from the songs themes as a whole, but only briefly.  The songs are long, and I even hesitate to call them songs when they are more like pieces or movements.  In many cases they grow from start to finish, and are a different entity at their completion as they were at their conception.   <br /> <br />The characteristic peaks and valleys which Tool is know for are still  there, however, they have taken a slower approach to this.  The songs build and deconstruct, but the soft/loud/soft attack just is not suitable for the songwriting, so they have avoided it. <br /> <br />With a few precursory listens, I can't make a complete judgment, but I do know art when I hear it, and I know there is a lot more for me to discover. <br /> <br />This album is not for the casual listen, and that will turn many people off.  I guarantee you that suits tool fine.
B000006OBQ|5.0|I strongly recommend you purchase 2 copies for yourself.  Your friends and family will want this for themselves.  I would have loved to have been in the audience this one night at The Sands Hotel in 1966 wearing a nice sport jacket with a bourbon in my hand.  This is Frank Sinatra still in his prime at the age of 51 with Count Basie and his orchestra right behind him.  Great music! <br />
B000EHRVP6|4.0|So, what's the big deal with this Hostel movie you've been hearing so much about lately?  Well, it's a big deal coz horror films like this don't tend to make their way into the mainstream much.  In fact, I wouldn't say Hostel is a horror film in the traditional sense, but considering the subject matter, what other category would you put in in?  It's horror in the same way that Last House On The Left is horror in that you get people senselessly tortured and killed, and a little revenge thrown in at the end.  Everyone who hated this film is very quick to point out that \\"it wasn't even scary\\".  Well, lets cut through the B.S. for a moment.  Since you were a child, have you really seen a movie that was actually scary?  I know I certainly haven't.  Entertaining, yes.  Creepy?  Disturbing?  Yes.  But no movie has ever made me afraid to walk around my home in the dark.  No, Hostel isn't scary, but it is disturbing.  All the tough guys out there are also quick to point out that it's not as gory as it's reputation would have you believe.  True, it's no Cannibal Holocaust, but we are talking about a mainstream film here.  Horror fans won't see gore they haven't seen before, but folks who occasionally dabble in mainstream horror films will probably get a smack in the face with this film.  I think the gore was in an acceptable amount, and handled well.  A movie packed with gore , while entertaining, is far from scary and usually becomes a parody.  Peter Jackson's Dead Alive is a no holds barred gorefest, but the film's hilarious.  Hostel tries to treat it's violence seriously.  The reactions to the violence from the main characters are realistic-they react with terror, disgust and pain.  While the acting from the leads in this film won't get oscars, you have to admire how well they switch from dumb comedy stereotypes to frightened helpless human beings.  Their lameness in the first 45 minutes is almost forgiven.  If these same characters were in a slasher flick, you'd be rootin' for their deaths and cheer when they came.  The intensity of their performances in the torture chamber are good enough that they become human, and while you don't actually care for them exactly(this is only a movie after all, it's not like they're in any real danger) , you don't really want to see them die this way.  The film does a decent job with suspense in the first hour when the guys are starting to catch wind that something wrong is happening.  In fact, the buildup is actually better than the payoff.  The actual torture chamber scenes only take up about ten minutes of the film.  After escaping his room, the main character tries to find his way out of the building(the overall look of the factory is actually quite stellar).  Some decent suspense here, but it kinda plays out like a stealth mission from a video game like Manhunt or Hitman.  Once out, the guy gets the Charles Bronson bug and wants to get a bit of revenge.  This was cool also.  Considering this character was the wisecracker of the bunch, it's neat to see him so serious for the rest of the film.  It would have been so easy to have him deliver some smartass comment to his assailants, and that would have been awful.  Most likely it would have happened that way too if it had been a bigger production.  Folks seem to think the ending was a letdown as well.  Well, I guess every film can't end with a big explosion and twenty minute chase through the streets of Slovakia, which I'm sure Jerry Schmuckheimer would have provided if this was his production.  The ending may have been anticlimatic, but it seemed more realistic to me.  In fact, anyone who would escape such an ordeal would simply run away and not look back, and not even bother messing with the torture people anymore.  The only big mistake Roth made was with that gang of little kids who kill a couple of guys when payed in candy.  This was actually quite stupid and ruined what up to that point was a serious film.  Overall, Hostel is actually a good film when you consider the current state of mainstream horror films.  There's no MTV/Attention Defecit Disorder style editing, and thank God it's not a remake of a great classic horror film.  The humor was more miss than hit if you ask me.  I've also never been a big fan of sex and nudity.  Folks  who hate this seem to always point out the nudity as a redeeming quality to the film, but I always figured if a movie sucked it sucked, nudity or not.  I can't watch a bad film even if it's wall to wall breasts.  Yes, it was a bit excessive in the sex department.  If I want nudity, there are other types of films I prefer to see it in(they're usually in the back of the video store and come in black dvd cases kept behind the counter).  It's certainly not a film I would purchase, but I'd have no problem with watching it again.  Best horror film we'll see come out of the mainstream for awhile.ilm when you consider the current state of mainstream horror films.

B00005NTN5|5.0|If you find yourself wishing there were more lesbian gangster movies with gratuitous violence, Bound is the answer to your prayers.<br /><br />As the hard-edged girl (ex-con) next door, Gina Gershon is alluring, sexy, and convincing.  She is particularly adept at plumbing, which becomes a plot point later, and the scenes of her in a muscle T-shirt working on pipes are among the steamiest on screen.  However, Bound belongs to Jennifer Tilly whose Betty Boop voice and figure provide the film with its most intoxicating appeal while concealing its most intelligent and devious personality.  Watching these delicious dishes go to Home Depot together and test power tools for 90 minutes would have been fine with me, but the Wachowski brothers instead elected to trot out the exhausted rogue's gallery of gangster devices including Mob bosses and under-bosses, briefcases with gazillions of dollars neatly bundled, the obligatory truly moronic henchman, and of course, the double-cross.<br /><br />Joe Pantoliano, a journeyman actor doomed to a life of roles like this, who added much to the amazing Memento, helps keep the various balls airborne with a fine performance.  As Caesar he is cruel and clueless all at once, unaware that his girlfriend, Tilly, is caulking tile with Gershon, and more.  As it does in all such gangster films, the third act finds things going terribly awry, and there is a fair bit of needless, indelicate violence.  However, this is redeemed by madcap comic timing that will have you overlooking the downright Shakespearean body count as you focus on split-second exits and entrances that could, and do, change everything.  (Scarface meets A Day At The Races.)<br /><br />The end of this movie will cause you to smile and wonder how you could have been so readily deceived, but then, even for another lesbian, falling in love with a lesbian is a tricky proposition.  For a straight male, at the very least it's living dangerously.  A delightful flick worthy of inclusion in your collection.  Arguably the greatest lesbian gangster film of all time.uably the greatest lesbian gangster film of all time.
B0006L0LOS|1.0|Common sense kept me away from this film, but I happened to catch some of it.  I didn't catch much, but something tells me I really didn't need to see more than I did.  First off, it's directed by a guy who uses only one name to address himself.  That's a big no-no, especially if you're a nobody.  Second, and this is the most valid point:  How in the hell can you take an insanely sexy concept like Catwoman and an insanely sexy woman like Halle Berry and completely screw it up so it isn't sexy at all??  Only Hollywood can.
B000ETQRCM|4.0|Contrary to conventional wisdom, Pearl Jam's last several albums have all been very good.  No Code didn't sell well, but that had more to do with Pearl Jam's overhyped rage against the machine, and specifically against Ticketmaster, than any lack of quality material.  Yield is right up there with Pearl Jam's best.  Binaural and Riot Act both sport a few clunkers towards the end, but each has several songs as good as anything Pearl Jam has done. <br /> <br />Now comes \\"Pearl Jam,\\" being hailed as the band's best since Vitalogy.  It may be, but Pearl Jam has never made anything other than a very good album, and this is yet another great one.   <br /> <br />\\"World Wide Suicide\\" is their best single since the glory days, but only because Pearl Jam finally picked the \\"right\\" song to release as the first single, rather than past choices like \\"Who You Are,\\" \\"Nothing As It Seems,\\" or \\"I Am Mine,\\" all good songs but none well-suited as singles. <br /> <br />In addition to \\"Suicide,\\" \\"Pearl Jam\\" has several great punk-flavored rockers.  \\"Severed Hand\\" is an instant PJ classic, and \\"Life Wasted,\\" \\"Comatose,\\" and \\"Big Wave\\" are not far behind and punky, riff-driven hard rock. <br /> <br />In the mid-tempo range, \\"Army Reserve\\" and \\"Marker In the Sand\\" are both good album cuts, and \\"Unemployable\\" has a cool 70s laid-back vibe to it.  The CD closes with two slow-burning anthems, \\"Come Back\\" and \\"Inside Job,\\" but the former takes the edge if only because of McCready's clumsy lyrics in the finale.  There's not a bad song on the CD. <br /> <br />The playing, as always, is impeccable.  But then name another big time band that plays a different set list every night, and not just by rotating a few songs, but by playing an entirely different set.  They've again captured all their playing talent on tape:  guitars are great, bass is fluid, and few other rock drummers can pull off the strange timing of cuts like \\"Parachutes\\" and \\"Life Wasted.\\"  Vedder may be losing his voice a bit, but thesinging is still great and though his lyrics have always received far too much attention, they continue to be well above the average rock schlock. <br /> <br />In short, another great album from a great band that has never failed on CD yet.  And we all know the tour will be awesome.
0812974611|4.0|If you're like me, you've been fascinated with Pompeii since you were a child.  Who doesn't remember staring at pictures of the plaster casts of the people who met their demise during the eruption? <br /> <br />This book brings back all of the facts and more to the forefront.  It tells the story of Vesuvius and the surrounding historical characters from the viewpoint of the Aqueduct Engineer.  Harris includes interesting tidbits concerning the appetitites (horrific food), depravities and other social aspects of Pompeii.   <br /> <br />If you've ever wondered what the ancient Roman's were really like; I'd definitely recommend this exciting, and quick read.
B00005T30L|5.0|LA has everything, and everything there is always changing.  As a middle-aged man, born and raised in LA, I was able to identify with Thora Birch's character.  Forty years ago (1965), I cared little for the changes going on then.  Now, I refuse to live there at all.  There is no sense of permanence within the culture.  Even in socialist Europe, they hang on to the skeletal framework of their religious past. <br />The psychological implications of subjecting youth to capitalistic absurdity is revealed in this film.  Where \\"Falling Down\\" depicted the psychosis of one of LA's unfortunate, Ghost World presents a non-violent study of someone who is beginning to acknowledge how lonely the world is.  Humanity's vulnerability is displayed with simplicity and humor in this brilliant film.
B000ETQRCM|4.0|First of all let me say I am sick of so called fans saying \\"when are we gonna see another TEN?\\" The answer is you're not. Ten in my opinion isn't Pearl Jam. It was written by Eddie (lyrically) when he was what 25? full of angst and in a new band that was basically an offshoot of an old band.  <br /> <br />PJ in my opinion found their sound on Vitalogy (although I love Vs.) and this album is like the spawn of Vitalogy and Yield - my 2 fav PJ albums the result my 3rd fav album, although I don't want to rank against the others until the honeymoon period is over. <br /> <br />To the album anyway. The best tracks are Life Wasted, Marker In The Sand, Comatose (Vitalogy anyone?), Gone (Yield?), Inside Job and Come Back. The latter is awesome!! About half way through I was ready to skip but that solo and outro singing blew me away, A real crowd ready sing-along. <br /> <br />I always have high hopes for a new PJ album, but must admit to being dissapointed by Riot Act and Binaural (by no means bad albums) but this is an album that finally lives up to the hype and should once and for all remind the world that PJ are one of the most powerful rock bands around!!!

B00006LLNU|5.0|I have a very large and varied musical library, and until yesterday didn't own a single Sigur Ros track.... <br /> <br />On Saturday night - April 29, 2006 - I had one of the most wonderful musical experiences of my life while attending The Coachella Musical Festival in Palm Springs.  I \\"EXPERIENCED\\" Sigur Ros live as my introduction to their music.  It was towards the end of their \\"set\\" and I was standing behind the woman I love.....the sun was setting, the desert air was chilling, the palm trees were swaying and the music just ripped through my body and twisted my soul.  The tears ran down my cheeks as I realized this was a night I would never forget!!! <br /> <br />If you're afraid to let music take you to a place in your heart that you've never been, then don't buy this album. If you're brave enough to go there, you'll never be the same.  As I indicated, I own LOTS of music....nothing compares to the sheer beauty of this album, or any of their other work/art. <br /> <br />DON'T PASS THIS UP!!!
080726203X|4.0|As many reviewers noted, The Giver is a wonderful book. However, the audio CD is is not divided by chapter. Each CD contains about 14 files. They all have the same track name, such as \\"track 1\\". All CDs have a \\"track 1\\". It's confusing for the player when you load the CDs. It thinks it's the same file. <br /> <br />Anyway, I was commenting on the audio CD itself, not the novel.
B00004YW6I|5.0|Stories from the city, stories from the sea by the ultra-cool P.J. Harvey is a kick-ass album with a great concept. Harvey wrote these songs in New York which compose the theme of this album, I love concept albums, they are creative and special. I love all 12 tracks, this album is my all-time favorite by Harvey. A Place Called Home is her best song on this album, \\"You're wanted this time when love comes the day, just hold on to me...\\" Good Fortune and This Is Love are great love songs with great guitar riffs blazing in the background. There is something about the song, You Said Something, very mysterious yet simple, \\"We lean against railings, describing the colors, and the smell of our homelands, acting like lovers...\\" This Mess We're In is a duet with Radiohead's frontman Tom Yorke, a lovely song. We Float and Horses in My Dreams are epic ballads. The whores hustle and the hustles whore, and Big Exit perfectly desribe the city of New York, \\"I'm sacred baby, I wanna run, this world's crazy, give me the gun, baby baby ain't it true I'm immmortal when I'm with you...\\" I'm sure a lot of fans were none too pleased with the high-production on this album but I love it. P.J. Harvey got it right with this album, highly recommend this fabulous and earthy creation.
B000EULJLU|2.0|I can't believe that they took 5 years to make this cd.  This cd is soooooo not tool material at all.  Maynard is too worried about being a bleeding heart liberal and not focused on his lyrical ability and music ability anymore.  The lyrics are not so deep and meaningful and there is a song on the cd where maynard's balls sound like there getting squeezed.  There also is a couple songs which are just noise, and for taking 5 years to create this album that should not be on there.  I think TOOL is running out of ideas for music and this album proved it to me.  I love any previous album before especially Undertow and Aenema, even Lateralus was alright, but this one just sucks.  I like 2 songs and that's it.  Maynard stop being so worried about the war with the rest of the Hollywood Liberals and start focusing back on your music.  They should put out another album quick and act like this one never came out.
B000EULJLU|5.0|You cant expenct to hear every detail in this listen right away.  <br />Magnifent this album is just wonderfull to listen to. <br />Tool are masters of drum, bass , guitar and vocal.  <br />They keep you right on the edge this whole album.  <br />I have bee listing to tool for 9 years and this stands as there best work yet. They incorporate elements from all there past releases. As  musicans they Danny, Justin, Adam and Maynard has refined themselves  to near perfection. As evident on the whole album. The druming is fast and complex. Best drums on any tool album. The bass is will destroy your speakers, Adam Jones guitar is well timed and very sick. Maynard is just excellent to see how much he has come as vocalist is wonderfull. He busts plenty of good screams through out.  <br /> <br />Yes alot of the songs well all of them a 5+ min not to mention the few 10min+ crushers. Yes there are a much on \\"segue\\" tracks that are bascially gradious intros to other songs but tool has always done this. Its funny to see reviews actally complain about this. I'm sick of typing now. This album is awesome,intense as any tool relase, and inspiring. 5 Star essincial listen.
B000EULJLU|4.0|I waited for three days before I wrote this review, because I don't believe anyone can listen to a TOOL album in the first day and actually absorb it.  Here is an accurate description of what to expect. Typical TOOL, there is too much \\"filler\\" that should have been used for \\"real\\" songs. Just like Pink Floyd, they always try to bridge the gap between songs with various sounds and create a visual and sonic landscape, but it just doesn't work for me. Maynard's voice has really gone downhill. However, \\"The Pot\\" shows he can sing with a lot of emotion. <br />I don't really like the lyrics on most songs. Too vague maybe? <br />Adam's guitar is just incredible. Justin's bass lines should finally put him in the same class as Geddy Lee and Chris Squire for being able to make the instrument an integral part of the song. And Danny. Well, he is a musical talent that goes beyond any comprehension of what a drummer and percussionist is.  <br />Since it is TOOL, I know it will grow on me more each day. But this is not a perfect CD. There are 4 instant classic songs.  <br />Beyond that, I wish they would break away from being so experimental. Just a little bit.
1400062756|5.0|For anyone who is frustrated and feeling like they are not living up to their potential this is definitely and must-read book. <br /> <br />It's a highly informative and insightful work which explains how our mindsets can effect everything we do in life. Through exhaustive research and many anecdotes (including the author's own life experiences)we learn how attitudes and mindsets have the ability to transform who we are and what we achieve. The book draws the reader in immediately because of lively prose and intelligent style. The fact that the author illustrates her points using life experiences and stories from dozens of individuals, including celebrities and captains of industry, gives this scholarly work a unique edge. Everyone can really learn and benefit from this book, but it should be mandatory reading for all parents. The ways we praise our children can have a profound impact on their futures, on both their performance and the way they view themsleves in the world.  <br />If you want a happier life for yourself and your kids read this book. <br />
B000EULJLU|5.0|I have read others' reviews of this album posted here on this website...I was so thrilled to buy this, album.  I have been waiting for years, and when I read some of the more disparaging reviews, I thought \\"oh no\\".  Nonetheless, I bought the album.  Let me just say, I am more than relieved with what I am listening to.  The detractors must be Aenima fans...those that only listen to four minutes of the song before pushing the arrow button on their stereos.  This is an incredibly sophisticated and beautiful album...deeply tragic and full of primal feeling.  Certainly, Tool takes their time and some of the tracks are too 'Eon Blue Apocalypse', but most are magnificent.  Ignore the bad reviews and listen to each and every song all the way through.
B000002KGT|5.0|This has got to be one of the best Albums ever put out. I bought this many, many moons ago. I still have the original Album I bought when I was a teenager and have now bought the CD. I listen to this all the time and it will never go out of style nor lose its freshness. Fleetwood Mac is not only a Vintage group, but they set the path for so many other artists.
B00005JOIH|1.0|Eric Bana turns in a fair performance as Avner. Bana is not known for his blockbuster roles.<br /><br />The story is absurd. The movie is based on true events, but when the cut and pasted pieces of the actual events of September, 1972 end, complete fantasy ensues. The movie shows a handful of relatively incompetent \\"regular\\" guys plotting assassinations to avenge the Black September attacks on the Israeli athletes. They are so darn regular you just want to get up from your chair and go watch a football game rather than sit through any more of this long, dragging snooze of an action movie.<br /><br />The movie, worse still, smells of political righteousness and how humanely these people were assassinated. One scene shows one of the conspirators running desperately to stop his associates from activating a telephone bomb when the target's little girl answers the phone. The scene left the sense that there was some political message that the scene and the movie reek of for 2 hours and 45 minutes. That message is the same tired saw...love Jews, love Israel, oppose Israel and you are an anti-Semite. Its not as simple a conflict as that in reality.<br /><br />There is nothing memorable about the movie, the score, the cinematography, the script and the acting are all subpar at best. It leaves you wanting to watch a good movie. How this piece of drivel could garner even one academy award nomination is obvious. Steven Spelberg. Mr. Spelberg I celebrate your accomplishments, Jaws, Poltergeist, Schindler's List and Jurassic Park to name a few. Please don't inflict any more movies like this on us anymore.<br /><br />After Munich, we watched \\"One Day in September\\" [[ASIN:B000BNXD6E One Day in September]] which is a documentary about the same 1972 attacks. We decided that, for the time involved, we would have rather watched One Day in September twice rather than Munich once and we still would have had a few minutes to spare. If you want to watch something that fairly treats both sides and is extremely entertaining, walk by Munich and pick up One Day in September.<br /><br />After this review I watched the made-for-TV original fictional account of the horrific Munich Games attacks \\"21 Hours in Munich\\" [[ASIN:B000BNXD5A 21 Hours at Munich]]. Its much better than \\"Munich\\" and escapes too much one-sided political preaching. It doesn't pretend to be ponderous, its a 70s \\"Cowboys and Indians\\" type movie. William Holden is a fantastic actor. I guess you could see Munich as the sequel to \\"21 Hours in Munich\\"?
068987474X|4.0|I actually enjoyed reading it, matter of fact I bought it for a couple of my friends for Christmas. I dont think they liked it as much as me. I think the women that have a hard time in this area might find the book too offensive because the writer goes right to the core of the problem and does not sugar coat it. He tells it like it is and the truth hurts especially if you know you are one of these women that fit the stereo-type. Alot of us stay in denial especially when we really want it to work.... but the signs are very clear when 'He's Just Not That Into You!'
B000EULJLU|5.0|Prior to this CD, I had to listen to Tools album several times to absorb and appreciate the music. This is the first ever CD I've  picked up and loved from beginning to end! Although the wait was long since the release of their last CD, Lateralus, it was well worth the wait! Excellent percussion, guitar riffs and vocals - it's Tool, what do you expect? <br /> <br />There is definitely a sound of maturity. Ten Thousand Days seems more grounded and cohesive and less experimental. This album gives me the impression he has something to say and he wants us all to pay attention...and I'm listening!
B00000IL1K|5.0|Sarah's style and her music are so unique. She has such a wide array of followers/fans because she creates things for all types of music lovers. She is so faithful by staying within her classical background, but she mixes in her own style that gives it a freshness and a very unique sound.
B000EULJLU|5.0|Like most people, I'm sure, the first time I heard 10,000 Days I was a little disillusioned but more scared than anything.  It was very similar to the feeling I had the first time that I listened to Lateralus.  This is the same TOOL greatness we have all come to love.  Each song is distinctive and necessary.  The rocky soundscapes of the album's middle are book ended masterfully by the more conventional TOOLness of Vicarious and Right in Two.  You will probably have to learn to love 10,000 Days.  Listen to the album at least three times through, which can be difficult at nearly 76 minutes, but in usual TOOL fashion could not be more fun or more worth it.  One of the most pleasant surprises about this album is it's packaging.  The CD is amazing and the package that it comes in is worth the purchase price alone.  This has been well worth  the wait and every last bit of this album is pure TOOL brilliance.  No one should hesitate when buying a TOOL album, and 10,000 days is no exception.  You won't be disappointed.
B000EULJLU|1.0|This cd is bland, unimaginative, and possess portions that would only appeal to someone on so many drugs that they would occasionally forget how to breathe
B000EULJLU|5.0|While not as powerful Aenima or as epic as Lateralus, this Tool album is still amazing, to say the least.  Listen to it once all the way through, and it's guaranteed you won't like every song- and that is how all Tool albums are- but keep listening and it's sure to grow on you like a tumor, haunting your every thought and step.  Not joking, and not a blind-Tool love review, but this is one of the best efforts of any band, ever.  As long as Tool keeps working the world is a better place.  peace
0671027387|3.0|If you've already read The Davinci Code and Angels and Demons, and are looking for more Dan Brown suspense, you might be a little disappointed with Deception Point.  It's slow in the beginning, but don't give it up.  The last 100 pages is some of the most exciting I've ever read.  Check it out!
B000BNNLN4|5.0|This book is a delight - but especially for anyone with any sort of background or experience of Eastern Europe. The characters are amazingly true-to-life - they make you laugh and make you cry, and in doing so illustrate the chequered history of Ukraine. It's a land that's been left a grim legacy by the Soviet Union - but the people bounce back, in whatever way they can. It's a great story of family interactions, between two sisters, their elderly father, and his new wife - and I loved every word.
B0007P0LO8|5.0|I completely disagree with some of the reviewers.  How easy it is to misunderstand a fine director's intentions!<br />The story of \\"Butterfly\\" is one of the most sordid tragedy in all opera repertoire. Think about it.  An innocent 15 year old girl to escape poverty, thru a profit-hungry marriage broker, marries an opportunistic and unscrupulous American sea captain who seduces and abandons her..  She is cursed and abandoned by society, robbed of her child and driven to suicide.<br />So what do the reviewers want?  Pretty Japanese scenery with Fujijama in the background?<br />The director created a unique film  that's atmospheric, surrealistic, colorless to suit this story.  The set: a nondescript cottage surrounded by a depressing barren field.  Characters are well drawn, even the secondary ones. (eg. the grotesque but frightening Goro  or  the terrifying Bonzo).<br />It is unfortunate that the 15 year old Cio-Cio San is played by a much older singer which is illusion destroying, but Mirella Freni is superb, it is HER role.<br />Musically this set is absolutely without equal,(perhaps the magical Sinopoli comes near,but that's a CD) but I must emphasize the contribution of Karajan, who is the genius behind it all.  I never thought he was a Puccini fan, but obviously he has a special feeling for this work.  He takes a dramatic view of the score and almost re-discovers the opera. His ear for detail is uncanny, the love-duet is sensuous with soaring melodic lines, the great aria (Un bel di) rarely sounded more dramatic, full of emotion. It just builds and builds!  And the 3rd act is so powerful, it will leave you breathless. You won't forget this film easily.
B00005NWLO|5.0|This is a must have in your CD collection. By far one of the greatest live CDs I have ever bought. The triple guitar threat can not be beat!!! Steve Gaines, Al Collins, & Gary Rossington ripped it up on every song. They added new guitar fills in majority of the songs that you can only hear on this CD. Will for sure take you back to the Southern Rock Days. I would not pass up this deal. 2 CDs of non stop rock-n-roll. Will not be upset with this buy.
B000EULJLU|5.0|Tool has always had a way of evolving through their cds.  This cd is no exception. Many people post that this cd isn't heavy or catchy enough for them like the past cds.  I don't think it was Tool's intention to be catchy or heavy on this cd.  Upon the first listen (in my car) i noticed that the vocals were a bit low in the mix and hard to hear in my car. I took it home and went straight to headphones.  This is the way to listen to this cd.  There are so many layers that pop out at you through headphones, especially in Wings for Marie/10,000 Days and Rosetta Stoned.   <br />     This is an incredible album that definately shows musical maturity, but also looks back a lot to styles from all of their past cds.  The Pot really sounds like a song that couldve been on Undertow, and Rosetta Stoned could've easily fit on Aenima...etc.. Anyways, it seems to me that the mood of this cd is meant to be a lot calmer, more reflective, and melancholy than their past works which had a lot more anger. and i'm sorry, but angry music has just become a bit mundane these days.   <br />     It is true that this cd is a bit less cohesive and doesn't flow like Lateralus did.  And when someone complains about the filler, I mean seriously, listen to Aenima all the way through.  There is a whole lot more filler on that cd than this one. <br />      All in all i think that this is a really great cd, even though I am still partial to the epic proportion of Lateralus, this cd still is worth every penny.  <br />Wings for Marie/10,000 Days in my opinion is a fantastic masterpiece musically, lyrically, and atmospherically as well. Remember the headphones and you will really be taken into the music. <br />I can't wait for the tour, Keep up the good work Tool!
B000EULJLU|5.0|Lets keep this short and sweet.This album blew me away. Beautiful, haunting, heavy at times, climactic, and most of all spectacular. I cant believe anyone who enjoyed all the previous albums(most of Tools fan base) could possibly say this isnt a masterpiece. The only reason one could say this CD is bloated with filler is because the rest of it is so exceptional. A couple of the tracks are remeniscent of its predecessors but uses the nostalgia created to berth a musical beast all its own.  Faves: Wings 1 and 2, Rosetta Stoned, and Right in Two
B00006IU73|5.0|Very memorable melodies, beautiful atmospheric interludes and well- crafted tunes make this a MUST buy! Listening to this album brings a joy to my heart. This is intense, penetrating music which strongly contradicts the very superficial garbage being peddled by the media at large. WARNING: This music will affect your SOUL, but in a very positive way. These are highly talented MUSICIANS that don't have to wave a banner by the use of overindulgent, ego- gratifying solos. They simply let the music do the talking, and this WORK speaks volumes. PORCUPINE TREE RULES!!!!!PS: I am not someone who simply jumps on a bandwagon. I am a progressive rock fan of 30 years and it's just DARN exciting to hear GREAT music again!
0140143505|2.0|Why do publicists lie so much? A 'love affair'? This shows how unreliable the comments on the flaps and covers of books may be.      Her correspondence with Mr. Doe is scarce for a span of +20 years. And how on earth did she manage to keep the letters she sent to Marks&Co? Maybe she wrote them on carbon paper and kept the copies for +20 years? She retrieved them from the addressees after +20 years?     Leaving aside the veracity of those letters, Helene Hanff's relationship with Frank Doel is that of a customer and a seller; nothing more, nothing less. Their letters educate us about some literature and about the availability and good/bad conditions of the books in Marks&Co, in a post-war background. Not very enticing.    If we bear in mind that this is a 'diary' kind of book, it is essential that we get on with the author. But I find her writing style irritating: she often behaves like a hysterical insisting person; she over-uses words written in capital letters and exclamation marks; and always tries to be witty and funny. No wonder the attitude of londoners was often restrained and odd while she was in London.    I'm glad Miss Hanff got her letters published at last, but in my opinion this is an overrated booky.
B0000027RL|5.0|Simply stated, a better rock album has never been produced.  Every song on Ten could be a hit single.  \\"Evenflow\\" is the best song Pearl Jam has ever written, heading the list of great songs like \\"Alive,\\" \\"Release,\\" and \\"Black.\\" If you don't own Ten, you are not a true rock fan.
0671646788|3.0|Most of what the author said is easier said than done. We all know this kind of saying: \\"If you think you can, you will. If you think you can't, you're right\\", but what matters most is how to take action.  <br />David Schwartz give us many great facts about thinking big. Unfortunately, his suggestions are rather short and not very well effective. To think big, one needs much more motivation and inspiration, which can be found in much greater and more complicated books like \\"Your best life now\\" and \\"NLP\\". These books challenge us more and give us better solutions. <br />At the end of the book, David Schwartz talked about \\"Setting Goals\\". Hey there, setting goals is the single most important and difficult task of one person's life. A big book may not have helped us enough with this, not to mention just a few pages. <br />I'm not saying that this book is not worth reading. It's just that it's not enough. You may like this book if you're new to the concept of thinking big, but you'd need more and better books to really grasp the concept. <br />(to the reader who prefers this book to Think and grow rich by Napoleon Hill and those who haven't read TnGR: Napoleon Hill is one of the greatest teachers to us all. If one really wants to challenge your mind and transform your life, TnGR is THE book. Great books are never too easy to comprehend. We need to really THINK, PONDER! <br />
B000EULJLU|4.0|Okay well I have had the chance to listen to 10,000 days a few times and I think it's great, even if it may have some shortcomings. True, there may not have been an enormous evolution since Lateralus, and that has disapointed fans. True, the more experimental stuff wears a bit thinner. But all in all, the sound is just fantastic. This band do what they do and they are top notch at it. It's them for sure and I can't seem to get enough of it for the time being. I don't care how deep or not deep it is. The songs still work for me.  Must listens in order of preference: Vicarious, Jambi, Wings of Marie, 10,000 days, (Lost Keys and)Rosetta Stoned, the pot, Right in Two.      This is fantastic stuff.
B000E1ZBGS|5.0|In reading other reviews of this movie, I felt I just had to be one to say something nice about it! Just like every other movie, this one had strengths and weakness, here is my take on it:<br /><br />Strengths-<br /><br /> This movie looked amazing, it was truely beautiful to look at! The cinematography was beautiful and more artistic than a lot of flims that have come out. The colors were very rich, and the lighting was...perfect. Location shots were wide and encompassing; when Elizabeth first saw Mr. Darcy's home, you can \\"feel\\" and see how large and impressive it is. Another seen that stands out, was when Elizabeth was being shown around Mr. Darcy's home and is shown into a room full of light, and sculptures. The feeling of coolness in the room, being full of diffused light, and pale white marble figures, was lovely!<br /><br /> I also enjoyed a more \\"down to earth feel\\" to the family, and their looks. They may have had a richer station in the book, but the fact that the family was not swimming in silks, furniture and little lap dogs, hardly detracts from the film. Not to mention the sisters acted, well...like girls! We are not all perfectly behaved all the time, nor are we little angels.<br /><br /> Also, the ages for Elizabeth and Mr. Darcy in the actors, were closer to the book. And I think their youth and inexperience with love/relationships, was a nice refreshing way to act their parts.<br /><br /> Finely, I loved the big ballroom, dance! The music, wall to wall people and activity was very realistic. I felt like I was there in the room, listening to the girls talking, dancing and laughing. In our modern age of elictric lights, CD players and deodorant I think we sometimes forget what a candle light party, with a bunch of sweaty people in it would look like.<br /><br /> Weaknesses-<br /><br /> Yes, the story is kind of choppy. If you haven't either read the book, or seen the four hour A&E version you might be lost. Although strangely enough, I went to see this with four other women...all fairly \\"girly girls\\", and they all felt the story went \\"too slow\\" and was almost \\"too long for a movie\\".<br /><br /> Another thing I have to agree with, is that the different relationships could have been given more time, or better development. But still, at the end of the movie you don't leave wondering what happend to anyone, or wondering why someone was left out. You know what happens!<br /><br /> Conclusion-<br /><br /> In the end I really liked this movie. The twist's and a different artistic take on a good story, is always a pleasant thing. Maybe it wasn't historiclly perfect, or exact to the book...but if that is what you really want; Stick to the book.r women...all fairly \\"girly girls\\", and they all felt the story went \\"too slow\\" and was almost \\"too long for a movie\\". <br /> Another thing I have to agree with, is that the different relationships could have been given more time, or better development.

0393317552|5.0|This book altered the way I think about history.  It synthesizes a wide variety of information, some of which was familiar to me but was presented in a new light, into a coherent vision of how the world works. <br /> <br />Furthermore, in those areas where I have some knowledge, such as linguistics and the history of writing, Diamond does well--I am therefore inclined to trust him on matters closer to his field of expertise as a biologist. <br /> <br />So yes, some reviewers are in a spilkas because he concentrates on some factors at the expense of others (though several argue against strawmen instead of the actual book).  You show me a book where every statement is guarded and balanced with qualifications and hedges, and I'll show you a dull-as-ditchwater textbook.
B000002H70|5.0|The Cure is probably the best Goth-rock band ever! Robert Smith has a cool voice that suits their down-tempo yet bleak music. Disintegration is (arguably) one of the best albums ever written. I think every decade has its \\"album of the decade\\". The 60s had its Revolver, the 70s had its Dark Side Of The Moon, and the 80s had Disintegration (oh, and the 90s and Ok Computer). I'm sure many people would disagree with me on those, but whatever.<br /><br />Disintegration is mainly down-tempo, dark Goth Rock with lyrics that can make someone feel better. The melodies are actually quite catchy, such as in Last Dance and Fascination Street. But the lyrics.... so hopeless.... so bleak. Naturally, I love it. The synth gives a very cold atmosphere to the music, which sends chills down my spine every time I listen to it.<br /><br />If you want to hear the band that started (at least popularized) goth, buy this album to start out with. Then, move to other classics like Pornography and The Head on The Door. An amazing album indeed.
0671045865|5.0|I love to read and I really enjoy in depth stories ,yet feel I don't have enough time Vs. the anticipation of wanting to read all the time, so I started listening to books on cd's while I comuted I found myself listing to this book in my house, on my lunch break, aside from durring my comute; because it was that good. It really isn't typical Stephen King, but it is what we all know him for, in depth detailing and how he sucks you in to his story. A must read for all!!!!!
B000EMGAGW|2.0|I'm a huge fan of Mobb Deep. The Infamous and Hell On Earth are one of my favorite albums of all time,but this is just ridiculous. The people who say that we're \\"hating\\" try to hide the fact that Prodigy SUCKS now. Hell,He's not even rhyming on most of his songs (this has been happening ever since The Infamy came out) and most of the beats are garbage. I'd jam Get Rich Or Die Trying anyday instead of this POS,and I don't even like 50 Cent. Sad to say,but they need to give up the mic because they obviously got rich and stopped trying........

B000002IMG|5.0|When Testament released \\"The New Order\\" in 1988, they laid to rest the rumors that they might go through a sophomore slump. This album showed that Testament definitely didn't follow in the footsteps of some bands and use up all of their good material on their first album, thus leaving them strapped for ideas when the time comes to write/record their sophomore release. Now, don't get me wrong, I don't think Testament held anything back for their debut; \\"The Legacy\\" was a great album. But Chuck, Greg, Louie, Eric, and Alex obviously didn't run out of ideas, because \\"The New Order\\" is another prime example of thrash excellence.<br /><br />Chuck sometimes hits high notes (as in \\"The Preacher\\"), but he sounds best when he uses a low, gruff voice (which is most of the time). Louie's drumming is typically fast and talented, Eric anchors the songs with his rhythm guitar, and Greg's bass notes are occasionally audible, but (as is the case with \\"The Legacy,\\" and most early Testament discs) lead axeman Alex Skolnick runs the show. I shouldn't even have to tell you (it should just be a given) that Skolnick is in fine form, here. After all, he didn't earn the title of being a \\"classic\\" for nothing. On almost every song here, Alex pulls out more than a fair share of hefty riffs and amp-shredding solos.<br /><br />\\"Into The Pit\\" is one of my personal favorite Testament tunes, and it remains a concert favorite to this day (probably because Chuck has admitted the band wrote this song just to get the crowd moving). With a highly energetic beat, pounding, rapid drums, fast tempo changes, and a catchy shout-along chorus, \\"Into The Pit\\" is a timeless, top-shelf thrash song, and it's one of heavy metal's first ever mosh pit anthems..<br /><br />The other nine songs are almost as great. \\"Eerie Inhabitants\\" opens the album with a pretty, spacey acoustic guitar intro, and segues into a stomping beat which is propelled by a blistering guitar lead. Also included is a lengthy (50 second), winding, melodic and very complex solo (is there any other kind of Skolnick solo?!) Track three, \\"Trial By Fire,\\" has grinding, churning riffs and a wailing solo, making it probably the best song on this record for showcasing Skolnick's sheer talent. There are three other lost classics on here, including the speedy, bruising sixth track, \\"Disciples Of The Watch,\\" which is backed by a thumping rhythm section and careening guitars. \\"Nobody's Fault\\" is a risky but well executed and fitting Aerosmith cover, and is highlighted by clean singing and some almost Hammett-style guitar work. And, lastly, the album concludes with \\"Musical Death.\\" This is a mostly slow, completely instrumental song with beautiful acoustic plucking.<br /><br />If you're a thrasher or metalhead, you shouldn't even be reading this review. Even though it's sound quality is a bit dated, and the album, as a whole, is less than forty minutes long, you should already know that \\"The New Order\\" is a classic. Essential listening?

0671027573|5.0|And I don't mean it in the bad sense! Both of them were really something. Their arguments and generally all scenes together were the highlight of this novel. Both of them were smart-ass as Jaine herself pointed out but both of them gave and took insults at the same rate... I know a lot of people who can rip others off with their sharp tongue but none like Sam and Jaine who took being insulted too in the same spirit.  When the book ended I felt so disappointed because I was having so much fun with both of them and also Jaine's father who made an appearance in the end and his one joke kept me laughing for hours after I have finished the book. I wish Ms. Howard has given more scenes to the old man.<br />Shelley, Jaine's sister, told Jaine that it was near impossible to read a book peacefully after you have kids and I felt such a connection with her at that time because while I was reading this book I yelled, begged, tried to reason with my 2 and half year old daughter to let me read this book, just this one in peace because I was enjoying it too much.<br />Jaine's attempt to cut down on her cussing by paying for everytime she did it was hilarious. It wasn't working much and she had her own rules for it. I loved how Sam made her cuss and then ask her for the fine... i loved just about everything about Sam and Jaine.<br />The list consisting of Wannabe Qualities of Mr. Perfect wasn't entirely a joke in my opinion, after all it isn't like any woman would NOT like having a faithful, nice, rich,good looking man, with ten in.....uhhh ... generous physical attributes, who is also good in bed. So why the hell would the women of the world mind if some woman had the guts to say what they really wanted? I can understand men getting mad but why would women mind?<br />I for one enjoyed the formulation of the list and agree with it completely. It's not like I am asking for a Mr. Perfect. How can I? After all I am not Miss Perfect myself but what's so wrong in just dreaming of one. And the women who made the list called it science fiction themselves. But I guess not everyone in world can take a joke as it is intended to. As with the killer in this Novel couldn't take their joke and set on killing all of them. Well suspense was not held till long. You had almost guessed it even before it was revealed but I wasn't disappointed in this respect because I don't read Linda Howard for suspense. I read her books for romance and hilarious dialogues. I found Jaine similar to another of her heroine, Blair Mallory from `To die for', the kind who scare the guys off with their smart mouth and sharp brain.  But Sam was no Wyatt (who did get scared off by Blaire). I loved Sam. And Jaine was much better than Blair.<br />I would recommend this to all Linda Howard's Fans and also those who like to laugh out loud while reading their romance novels.who made the list called it science fiction themselves.

B000EMGAGW|4.0|There's been a lot of noize around Mobb Deep joining G-UNIT, how they sold out by embracing $.50 as their new boss. Well, when you get pass the haterade, the fact is, Blood Money is good, and Mobb Deep is still Mobb Deep, which shouldn't be a surprise, they epitomize gangsta rap, so I'd be more worried about G-UNIT sounding like the Infamous.<br />The production's got that grimy quality, you know Havoc's still on point, as far as the lyrics goes, well, gunz, money, drugs, sex, what else ? Mobb Deep's still Mobb Deep.<br />I can't understand why they didn't choose \\"Daydreamin'\\" or \\"Pearly Gates\\" as their first single instead of \\"Put em in their place\\", I'll bet $.50 had a hand in that, he probably doesn't want the Mobb to grow too big anytime soon, look at what happened with the Game.<br />Overall, a solid effort, don't listen to the haters, Mobb Deep is still Mobb Deep.
B000EULJLU|3.0|My biggest peeve with 10,000 days is their aren't any songs that I can both bang my head to, and sing along to.  The older Tool songs were catchy.  Sounds silly, I know.  Not that I am into commercial music, but I loved it when Maynard would spit venom while singing, 'Jesus won't you F***ing whistle!, something but the past and done?', 'Don't you step out of line, don't you step out of line, don't you F***ing lie!', 'Hope this is what you wanted, hope this is what you had in mind, cause this is what you're getting!'.  Very angry words that we can get into as music lovers.  Now I don't think one has to be angry to make a good song.  I am just saying their could have been more to this CD that gets me in the mood.  You know, a Tool mood.  I am not going to really compare this cd to the others.  It isn't supposed to be the same.  And it isn't.  It is definitely a journey, and I can listen to it and appreciate it for what it is.  I just wish they could have rocked out a little more, made it a little less 'artsy', and cut out a few of the filler songs.  But with them being Tool, I have grown to expect that.  I don't get it myself, but I am sure they have their reasons.  All of that being said, Tool is a tremendous band, and I hope this isn't the end of them.  I see them coming back with another CD that totally rocks.
B000BRBA8S|5.0|After watching this film, you know you've just seen the work of a filmmaker at the top of his game.  Wong Kar Wai has done some fascinating work.  In the mood for love and Days of being wild are both masterpieces.  But in 2046 he manages to put together the sort of layering that i thought was only possible in lengthy novels.  Story builds on top of story between two parallel worlds, one real and one fictional.  The score's amazing, the imagery is compelling, and the writing is sharp as a knife.  If you're a fan of WKW and haven't seen this movie, then you shouldnt immiedietly go find a copy and a good place to view it.  If you've never heard of Wong Kar Wai, I'd recommend watching Days of Being wild first.  And if you're not into films revolving around intense human relations with each other, i wouldn't recommend any of Wong Kar Wai's work.  Because honestly, that's a good 75% of what his movies revolve around.
B000ETQRCM|5.0|Ignore any review saying this is not a great record! I am a huge Pearl Jam fan, but I have to admit there last 3 studio albums where boring and strange. I love all of there live albums. And there is not a band out there that is better live then Pearl Jam. Anyways what everyone loved about 10 was it was raw straight forward rock, and the new album recaptures that energy and takes it a step forward. This is flat out the best ROCK album since the days of grunge. It is straight forward in your face rock and roll. What makes this better then 10 to me is how much better musicians they are now. I can go on and on, but if you are looking for the next hall of fame rock album look now further. Simply great. I can't wait to see this show live!
B000002BFL|4.0|Except for \\"Dry Lightning\\" and \\"My Best Wasn't Good Enough\\", I believe the songs on Springsteen's second acoustic record are very good. <br /> <br />The reason I give this four stars, however, is the production.  If I was the producer, I would have turned up the mike for Bruce's vocals and I would have drastically cut down on the keyboard instrumentation.  If he had only cut down - or, even better, cut out - the keyboards, we might understand his words better.  Also, if you listen closely to the acoustic guitar work Bruce does, it is wonderful... only problem is... you guessed it: keyboard overkill. <br /> <br />Looking beyond the keyboard instrumentation and the two aformentioned songs, though, I still recommend this album as Bruce portrays a portion of the United States that we either do not see or choose not to see. <br /> <br />Like I said in the title of this review, this record is not his best, but it is good nonetheless.
B000002P5R|5.0|(Astroman) Revolutionary YES!  Jimi's music revolutionized the rock world in a blaze of color, all of the great players of the day knew he was special.  Although he too derived his style from other music greats, his spirituality and raw energy created a new, ORIGINAL and enduring sound.  Nobody does Hendrix like Hendrix (it gets tiring hearing others claim that another guitarist does IT better ... INVENTING IT is the impressive part, even I can imitate IT pretty well, along with a legion of others enthralled with the beauty).  SRV, Robin Trower, Shawn Lane, Steve Vai, Terry Kath, Gary Moore, Eric Johnson, Nick Soloman and all others could only begin to approach his vision (of course they were/are huge talents in their own way, they could be thanked for carrying on the tradition).  He lived and breathed beautiful music, and what is demonstrated here is no exception.<br /><br />Listen carefully to this and weep for what was to come ... this dude was all over the place - just genius! Some of the songs just needed more work in the new studio, and WHO KNOWS what could have been.  Watch Dolly Dagger on Wild Blue Angel, for one of many examples, and see where these were going to be taken - powerful!  Get the Hendrix box set to see many of these stretched out and played with, you won't be disappointed.  I just don't feel like discussing the details of individual tracks - there are many, and I would have too much to say.  Of course, if you're a guitar player, get ready to go into psych (for psychedelic) 101, 201, 301 ..., every listen brings out new elements;  So many still emulate his sound today (his imprint is all over my consciousness and playing as well).  And don't just analyze complexity, but feel the spirit shimmering, this is gut-level soul music.<br /><br />His sun set far too soon, but the heavenly, warm, brilliant glow will stay forever (look at the right on cover art).  Essential recording, if there ever was one, even Electric Ladyland barely outdoes it.  The seeds that were sown have branched out impressively, hopefully the blooms will always set and never fade.  Thanks Jimi, for saving the day ...... FLY ON ANGEL!e sown have branched out impressively, hopefully the blooms will always set and never fade.  Thanks Jimi, for saving the day ...... FLY ON ANGEL!
B00005JOIH|4.0|This was by far one of the best films of 2005 and ranks right up there with Spielberg's Private Ryan and Schindler's List. However, I beleive that Speilberg spoiled the film by choosing the World Trade Center as the background of the final scene. What was the message of that shot supposed to be? Since America did not do enough to stop terrorism that we ended up paying an enormous price for our lack of effort? Was it supposed to be some ironic forebearance of the future? Up until that shot I was enthralled by Munich, but I left the theatre angry about the final scene.
B000EULJLU|5.0|When I heard Vicarious, I thought hmm... kinda like Lateralus as an album... but it isn't.  <br /> <br />Lateralus was very cerebral, songs were about very abstract concepts, the music was very repetitive and carefully jammy.  <br /> <br />So how do we open up the new Tool cd? A song about how humans need to watch stuff go down in flames, with some vivid and direct imagery.  <br /> <br />Next up, we have Jambi with its odd-time stomp and frightening (with headphones) talkbox solo, the topic of which is a testament to.... ? <br /> <br />Following the stomp, we pick up some insistently plodding songs where Maynard pours out his soul regarding his mother's death after suffering the affects of a stroke for roughly 10,000 days.  <br /> <br />Abruptly, omgwtfbbq, is that Maynard singing? Yeah, it's Maynard singing the intro to The Pot. Wow, I can't believe he did that! Well, he did that song on the Underworld soundtrack so don't be so surprised. Anyway, this song is the next radio single or I'm going to eat my hat. A big tirade following Ticks and Leeches, and Opiate, it rocks hard and features a pretty trippy guitar solo... except it's a bass solo. Also, it's not really about pot. Surprise! <br /> <br />Lipan Conjuring is some weird stuff.  <br /> <br />Lost Keys is this album's Parabol, a long intro with no words this time, save a dialogue between a badly-voice-acted nurse and an Aussie doctor regarding a patient who seems catatonic and freaked out. <br /> <br />Rosetta Stoned is why the patient's catatonic and freaked out. I   wanted to write it down for all the world to see, but I forgot my pen. This is a somewhat startling and really, really, really awesome song. It's about drugs, but it also reminds me of a greek myth... <br /> <br />Intension was seemingly boring, but it's not. It's just not a hard rocker. Enjoy. <br /> <br />Right In Two is a great look at how silly humans can be, and ends up the album quite nice. <br /> <br />Viginti Tres is a weird pile of noise.  <br /> <br /> <br />This album is really pretty awesome. That's a good way to describe it... awesome. Not awesome like, awesome dude, san dimas rules!! but more like, full of awe. <br /> <br />Finally, the stereoscopic packaging takes the weird lenticular graphics of Aenima and the Alex Gray eyeball-spiral-buddhist-dmt-acidtrip artwork of Lateralus and smashes them together in 3D photos of the band, signature Adam Jones artistic creepiness, and metaphysical trip-out graphics.  <br /> <br />If you like tool and think this album completely sucks, I would be surprised. This album is Tool, as much as any of their other work, if not more.

B0001GL3K4|4.0|\\"Love Actually\\" is an ensemble film with a smashing cast, a lot of mischief, class and wit that hide the fact that underneath it all lurks something that resembles those old television shows, \\"Love American Style\\" and \\"Love Boat.\\"  As Christmas nears, many different characters couple or uncouple amid the emotions and fuss of the holidays.  The creators look at just about every variation of love possible, from sexual lust to puppy love to friendship to realistic couples to Cinderellas and their Prince Charmings.  The pace is brisk, the cast so lovable that you don't realize quite how long the film is or how flimsy most of the storylines are.  Emma Thompson, Liam Neeson and Laura Linney will break your heart.  Hugh Grant and Colin Firth make the most of their charm.  Bill Nighy does an outstanding job as a bad boy over-the-hill rocker doing a come back, and while his story doesn't exactly hang with the others, it helps level the overall sugar content.      As long as the film runs, it was once 1 1/2 hours longer.  The DVD has scenes and storylines that were edited out.  Some of them are just as good as what is in the film.      Not for younger children.
B0000041DZ|5.0|There can be no serious doubt that these are among the distinguished performances by any musician on disk. Brendel recorded this cycle early in his career for Vox, then once again for Philips in the 80's; this last cycle, very likely the last he will ever record, exhibits Brendel, a magisterial musician, at the zenith of his genius. Comparisons with other great cycles, while inevitable, do little to point up the particular maturities of these readings. There are, of course, many ways of doing these sonatas. Schnabel is electrifying if a bit rushed on occasion, and often somewhat approximate in his fingerwork. Richard Goode has, perhaps, more rhythmic urgency, flexibility, and (where appropriate, particularly in the opus 2 sonatas) wit. Brendel's forte is in the elegant intellectual clarity of his playing, the sonic beauty, and a respect for the music that communicates itself instantly in the attention he gives to voicing, balance within a chord, to the shaping of phrase, and (most impressively perhaps) to the overall architecture of a movement. The clarity of his playing is nearly unexampled even among the very greatest Beethoven pianists (Backhaus, Arrau, Solomon, Ashekenazy). Goode alone among contemporary pianists gives as much attention to clarity (if not beauty) of tone, separation of voices, lucidity, intellectual and emotional meaning. The more intelligent the listener, the less apt he or she is to seek to stand above and evaluate these radiantly beautiful performances, and more apt, by concentrated listening, to absorb their beauty and learn from them.
B000ETQRCM|5.0|I just cannot understand any negative reviews for this album.  It's the best one they've made since Vitalogy.  After 3-4 listens it really really grows on you.  They've gotten back to an edgier & guitar-driven sound.  The first 4 songs are so explode out of the speakers.  Eddie Vedder has got the mojo back and sings with a sense of urgency.  Trust me, if you like Ten, Vs., & Vitalogy buy this record.  The album is a cross between Vs. and Vitalogy.  I highly recommend it.

On an Island is a great record from the Pink Floyd singer/guitarist and despite low sales is a great record with classics like the title cut, Take a Breath, This Heaven and Where We Start. I think Roger Waters said it best and I quote \\"if album are good only on how many albums have sold then Grease is a better record than Graceland\\", end quote. On an Island kicks the Hell out of any [...] TRL, eMptyTV and E2 drenched [...]!

0767803434|5.0|``Air Force One'' is a thriller that taps into our secretly cherished associations with the presidency. It gives us the president of our dreams, a president of mythic virtues, and then shows him desperately at risk.<br /><br />The catch is that the audience must believe that it's watching the president of the United States. Buy it, and ``Air Force One,'' now out on video, is halfway home. Don't buy it, and the film becomes a preposterous thriller.<br /><br />Fortunately, the film finds in Harrison Ford the one actor who can fully inhabit two kinds of grandeur -- action-movie bigness and the aura of the presidency. He has the ego and the intelligence for the job. He has the Gary Hart hair. He also has a quality that Americans perhaps are nostalgic for -- sincerity.<br /><br />As President James Marshall, Ford is beyond sincere. He is an impassioned visionary. We meet him for the first time at a Kremlin banquet in his honor, giving a speech in which he's about to implode with rage and moral fervor. ``It's your turn to be afraid!'' he warns terrorists. By the time Gary Oldman, as an obsessed Kazak super-nationalist, and his band of Communist mal contents hijack the president's Boeing 747, the act seems like a chilling violation.<br /><br />There's a violence to ``Air Force One'' that's simply not present in the more cartoonish action films. Bullets rip nasty holes into doors, and the sound of gunshots in the confined space of the presidential plane is a jolt. Oldman's enjoyment in murdering defenseless people makes the violence more personal and frightening. Director Wolfgang Petersen's action fantasy escalates into midair dogfights and elaborate stunts that have people dangling from the Air Force One parachute ramp and later trying to transfer via a cable to a rescue aircraft. There is a tone of confident military heroics and almost a reverence for the presidency that seem a throwback to World War II propaganda movies. ``Air Force One'' might not be the role of Ford's career, but it might be the ultimate role of his maturity.ord's career, but it might be the ultimate role of his maturity. <br />
0553381407|5.0|I have read several books that attempt to help adult children of abusive (verbal or physical) parents, but most authors fail to connect with me because they feel a need to give the most horrible stories and examples in their books.  My father didn't sexually molest me or tell me to die, but he did constantly belittle me with subtle remarks, jokes, criticisms.                                         This book spends over 100 pages giving stories and examples of all kinds of toxic parents,not just the ones that make the most horrifying read.  It seems  a little vague and scattered at first, because there are so many different examples of so many different types of toxic parental abuse, then you realize that most of the symptoms of the adult child who has suffered, are the same.  Children of alcoholics, molestors, belittlers, hitters, all share a commond bond of lacking an identity, and struggling with their self esteem, and fighting a rage deep inside them.   <br />   The second half of the book is the most impressive.  The author is surprisingly and refreshingly realistic in her advice on how to start healing.  She conveys that it is ok to feel whatever emotion you are feeling, because it is an emotion.  She sheds a brilliant light on the act of forgiveness, and how the general concept of \\"total forgiveness\\" is not always best with toxic parents.   <br />     It was just a well written and realistic book that I think will appeal to all adult children who had or have \\"toxic\\" parents.
0898159156|5.0|They have captured the imagination with grisly fascination... plants that EAT meat...and their sinister reputation has spawned generations of urban myths and 'B' horror films...<br /><br />Like the witty and intelligent man he clearly is, Peter D'Amato capitalizes on that popular image of carnivorous plants in his delightful book, THE SAVAGE GARDEN, describing the death-throes of an insect lured inside the glowing green hood of a Cobra plant with Hitchock-like glee.  But THE SAVAGE GARDEN is much more than gruesome description: D'Amato offers plenty of \\"meat\\" in his lively volume, describing in clear, concise prose the best soil mixtures, containers, and growing conditions (indoor and outdoor) for the best known, and some of the more obscure/rare varietals of carnivorous plants in the world.<br /><br />The day I stumbled upon D'Amato's invaluable guide, I had just rescued a depressed Venus Flytrap from my local nursery, and diligently potted it in a terracotta pot with regular soil on the advice of my supposedly knowledgeable garden expert. Thank goodness D'Amato told me what my nursery did not: the exact soil mixture needed, the ideal growing conditions, and the ALL IMPORTANT tip to use only rainwater or distilled water to avoid killing my little Flytrap with excess mineral deposits.  My 7 year old daughter and I have become utterly hooked thanks to D'Amato's clear, witty, and utterly intelligent approach to the care and cultivation of these plants which are largely misunderstood and sadly, quickly disappearing from their natural habitat.<br /><br />If you are interested in starting a collection, or simply learning about these beautiful and unique plants, D'Amato's book THE SAVAGE GARDEN will tell you everything you need to know quickly and concisely, and spur you to further exploration. D'Amato also offers gorgeous specimens for sale on his website, californiacarnivores.com.<br /><br />Our carnivorous \\"pet\\" collection has now grown to include 3 Cobra plants, 3 Venus Flytraps, 3 Sundews, and a tiny Pitcher Plant.

B000069CWE|1.0|Linkin Park were bad enough when they came out with hybrid theory which was basically three chords per song and a bad singer that got attention because he was saying everywhere: \\"hey look I can scream!\\" wanna hear real screaming? Check out underoath. Hybrid Theory has some OK songs but the way they remixed the stuff with a maximum of dj and turntables and sound effects is just terrible, the songs don't even sound like the originals anymore (which we could take as being good!). The only song I found good in this album was crawling and the only reason was because the guy from Staind was in there to stop the song from falling apart. If Linkin Park consider themselves to be heavy, why on earth do they bring stupid rappers in their song? I just don't get it, so if you're into famous bands that release an album to make money then there's no problem buying the only two original cds they made but for your own good, and for the good of your wallet, please dn't buy this one.

B000EQH2QK|3.0|For Shakira fans who supported her by buying the initial release of the album it's unfair to have to have a re-release with 2 new songs added. Next time I'll wait to buy her CD or just rip it from someone else. In this day and age when artists are constantly asking their fans to buy the CD instead of burning a copy from a friend, I would expect the artists to show some loyalty as well. I'm not buying the same CD twice for 2 extra songs, even though those 2 songs are probably the best on the album.
B000AMJG4Y|5.0|I never was really into Final Fantasy *FF* that much until after seeing a few short movie clips on Putfile.com and the TV commercial for the Final Fantasy:Advent Children. Now I'm a diehard fan of FF. The graphics are FF:AC are incredible !! Close to human-like details. I'm looking forward to seeing more Final Fantasy movies like this. Cloud and Vaan are my FF lovers ! I always ask myself why do they always make Anime men so sexy but you can never find one like that in real life. But this DVD is EXCELLENT !! I actually give it 10 stars and for the price they're selling at ... Add 5 more stars for Value. I expect this DVD was gonna cost me like $50 like some Anime DVDs I've seen at the store. But under $20 ? It's a steal !!! I highly recommend this DVD and you'll become a FF Fan yourself !!
B000EULJLU|5.0|This album is so amazing.  People complain of the long track length. Yet the album itself is seamless.  It is not in a pop format.  It is art for the sake of art.
0736412409|4.0|This is a cute board book for the purpose of introducing Disney characters.  It's a VERY condensed version of the Lion King story.  My son is 2 & it's condensed to an age-appropriate level of words to listen to.  However, the story is so condensed that it's really not that interesting as a story.  My son does like it though...  but you would only buy this book if you really want to introduce the characters to your child (especially if you were taking a trip to Disney soon).  The story itself is not that fascinating.  However, my son does like to see the zebras, giraffes, ostriches, etc.
0753453800|5.0|There is more to this book than meets the eye, you may lay to that. Apart from the fairy tale plot there is superb dialogue and dialect hidden in the pages. The relationship between Long John and Jim unfolds grippingly. There are also superbly detailed scenes of action and adventure allways achieved with an economy of language. The seafaring language is used very deliberately without any ostentation.  Always a pleasure to read. Great pace.
B000EULJLU|5.0|To sit down and actually analyze any tool cd is an overwhelming task. The unusual timings, the lyrics, the simple yet powerful guitar riffs, the uncomparable drum beats, they're undeniably, the best band. After \\"Lateralus\\" I couldn't begin to imagine what was next. Now that I've heard it I'm literally \\"blown away\\". The agressiveness of thier early albums, the complexity of \\"Aenema\\" and \\"Lateralus\\" rolled into 11 songs of pure bliss and euphoria. Finally, let me say, I waited 5 years for Lateralus, I waiter 5 for 10000 days, if I have to, I'll wait 7 for the next one. Anyone not sure about purchasing this album...Trust me, as a worshiper of Tool, listen to or (perferablly) buy this album... It will be the best 10$ you ever spent...
B000ETQRCM|5.0|Yes, indeed.  After you've eaten your own foot and drowned in a bowl of your own guts... yum yum yum, this one boils down to classic Pearl Jam fun.  Everything about this epic album is stripped down to the bone... raw artwork imagery, raw Vedder vocals, raw music that feels like a live recording with the energy of a live concert, and, yeppers, raw vibes blasting out your speakers with guts not often witnessed in the art world.  Hail, Hail you beautiful Jammers!
1400079179|1.0|It's really amazing that Dan Brown was only sued by one author. This book pilfers so much from Indiana Jones & the Temple of Doom, Name of the Rose, Adventures of Hudson Hawk, Foucaults Pendulum and presumably Holy Blood Holy Grail that he should have been tied up in the courts for years.<br /><br />The book covers gender history, religious politics, art, fantacism, asctetism, etc. I was definitely excited and receptive to see someone punch a few holes in Christianity's cloak of respectability. While the material is provocative it's linked in the junkiest, most arbitrary ways. The A/B storyline gag last used to such annoyance in Devil & the White City is used again here; where every chapter ends with the solution of a riddle or just short of the solution of a riddle to leave some bait to lure you through the next plodding police procedural chapter, which are all a snooze. Why did he choose \\"potboiler\\" as the genre to explore this material? At the halfway mark I was tired of each new shallow revelation of a yet another religious society, and wished the author would cover something (anything!) in depth. I was tired of beatin gthese idiot characters to solutions. I was begging people to point me at a good summary of the 2nd half so I could be spared the annoyance of continuing. It hedges it's bets that academia is a hard-sell that must have lots of physical action to relieve the poor audiences boredom. Robert and Sophie have no depth whatsoever.<br /><br />Next up is the movie (the book is a thinly-veiled script) from champion-of-the-dull Ron Howard. Watch for all references to sex to miraculously dissappear from Opies opus.<br /><br />Spoilers ahead>>><br />Worst of all the goal is never reached. But hey we all learned something. Isn't that swell?<br />Most unforgiveable, the moment the secret-villain was introduced I knew it, because it's the laziest, dumbest gimmick that lazy authors have been thinking is clever for twenty years (See Eyes of Laura Mars, L.A. Confidential, The Phantom Menace, & 2,000,000 other narratives.)000,000 other narratives.)
B000EMGAGW|5.0|the cd is actually 4 stars but all the haters continue to say this album is worth 1 star which is ridiculous. They clearly dont know what good rap is.
1400079179|5.0|I'm mainly a reader of non-fiction books. In fact Da Vinci Code is the first fictional book I've read in 4 years - I only read it because of the hype, the up-coming cinema version, and because my latest order from Amazon's non-fiction collection hasn't arrived yet. That said, it is fun and entertaining.<br /><br />For people deciding whether to read this book, I have some quick comments that may help you with your decision. First, it takes about 50 pages for the story to really build momentum; if you can bear with some mediocre writing to that point in the book you will be rewarded.<br /><br />After the first 50 pages \\"The Da Vinci Code\\" is written in a series of short punchy chapters. The construction of the story poses questions and mysteries, and leaves the answers just out of reach (until nearly the very end). I found this construction fun as a reader, because I kept guessing what the answers might be, which then kept me interested enough to keep reading to see if I was right. Frankly, (slow start aside), I found it a thoroughly engrossing story.<br /><br />Just one final point. People are now debating whether this book outlines, in fiction, a conspiracy that is factually true. Moreover, people are saying this book undermines Chritianity. I think such discussions are blowing the implications of a well-told murder mystery way out of proportion. If you really want to examine the basis of religion there are plenty of non-fiction historical and philosopical books on the subject that will tell you far more than \\"The Da Vinci Code\\" does.
B000EULJLU|5.0|When you have a band as special and unique as Tool, they are clearly held to higher standards, which is a double edged sword. I do feel that, unless you've listened to this about a dozen times, you shouldn't review it. It REALLY takes a lot of listens to sink in, something very little modern music does. I've seen a few complaints on here that it's sort of like \\"Lateralus\\" Pt. 2, and that's somewhat fair, but is that a bad thing!? Anyway, I'm sure i'm not adding anything new here, but i think this is a brilliant Tool cd, and almost perfect. I just think it takes a LOT of listens to realize just how special it is!
B000EULJLU|5.0|You,<br /><br />All,<br /><br />though that,<br /><br />this would be,<br /><br />an Epiphany,<br /><br />sent by Tool for you all to see,<br /><br />the divinity,<br /><br />deep with in,<br /><br />our soul,<br /><br />Ha!<br /><br />Ha!
B000EULJLU|1.0|No hunger, no honesty, no need to make music anymore for the sake of self expression. <br /> <br />Sounds to me like they got together in the studio because they have signed a contract over a number of recordings for their label. Simply money-making. Fake-Tool, eyes on black ground are not enough. <br /> <br />I guess Maynard wanted to go home to APC as soon as he could, \\"let`s get over and done with it\\" <br /> <br />I don`t want to listen to music which is \\"produced\\" just for commercial reasons. I want to hear things from people who have something to say. Tool is dead, they have nothing more to say.
B0000028RR|5.0|Rage Against the Machine's incredible debut stands head and sholders above all other metal albums of the 90s as far as originallity goes.  They fuse rap and rock/metal/hardcore perfectly with Zack de la Rocha's intense lyrical delivery, Tom Morello's totally unique way of playing the guitar (producing a variety of crazy sounds that seem to have no place coming from a guitar), and a tight rythmn section that never lets up. When put together these four tallented artists deliver a kick to the face in the form of the most militant sound ever produced in a studio making them the undisputed leaders of the modern \\"aggro\\" genre. An interesting fact about this music is that it is totally sexless, Zach and company stay true to thier political agenda/assault from the opening riff on \\"Bombtrack\\" to the final electrifying screams of \\"Freedom.\\" This thunderous album is right up there with Korn's debut two years later as one of the angeriest albums ever produced. Essential listening.
B000AP04FG|5.0|Some of the reviews about this movie simply made me write my own. And the most important thing I want to say is: relax, people! Have fun! If you want to feel smart and philosophical, pick up Kant or Schopenhauer and do some reading. \\"Mr. and Mrs. Smith\\" is a movie intended to make the audience laugh and hold their breath from time to time, but in a relaxed way. It's a light movie, but a well made one, with witty lines and gorgeous actors. I strongly recommend it to all who remember that the whole movie business started out as ENTERTAINMENT.
B000002LQR|5.0|This album is great. Buy it and you won't be diassapointed, i promise. There's something for everyone on Blood Sugar Sex Majik. Theres so much awesome stuff, so many different styles at work here ranging from funk to metal to rap to punk.  No doubt their greatest recording.  With the help of wonder boy producer Rick Ruben RHCP have created not only a thoroughly interesting a enjoyable listen but also makes a political statement and makes it fun. If there were six stars available i would give it a seven.
B0009WFFS6|5.0|When I first heard of the Cream reunion I thought this will most likely be good. Well it turned out to be GREAT. I have watched this DVD over 10 times last month.     So many of these reunion things are so disappointing, usually people do it for a quick buck and the music is bad. Cream however sound better then ever, 35 + years have really shown in their musical growth. Eric Clapton, Jack Bruce and Ginger Baker were all equally great. When I hear and see Eric, Jack and Ginger play those songs from the past, I can only think of one analogy: Fine Wine - better over time. So much has already been written concerning this great show, and most of it is accurate.     The one thing that was overly apparent to me after viewing this DVD is that Jack Bruce and will forever be lost to the fact that he is a great vocalist/bassist, yet so little of his work is known to the average music fan. Ginger Baker also has a lot of great albums, many sadly out of print, that are truly great. I love this DVD, I wish I could have seen the live show at Albert Hall.
0786856297|5.0|I read a chapter outloud to my two boys (7 and 8 years old).  They love it.  And, I can't put it down after they go to sleep! <br />It is exciting and creative and I love the use of greek mythology.  Plus-  any ADHD kid will love the idea that they could in fact be a demi-god!  We wondered aloud which kids in my son's classes could be demi-gods and which teachers might be monsters.  Lots of fun.
B000DZIGDU|2.0|first and foremost, this is basically exactly what being deployed is like. that being said...NO ONE NEEDS TO KNOW WHAT BEING DEPLOYED IS LIKE!!!!! it's boring, depressing, and not very interesting. any insight that might be made in your life is just internalized and rarely expressed with anyone, and once you get home you realize that you're probably just going slightly crazy. the monotony of if all is terrible and i wouldn't wish it upon anyone. so why in the world would anyone make a movie about it?    the acting is good and i could, maybe, understand why someone that's been in (or has been in) the military would watch it. it is definitely relatable if you've been in that situation.    NOTE: if you're on deployment i wouldn't watch this. the \\"dear john\\" scene will get you way more paranoid that you probably already are.
B000ETQRCM|5.0|I've been waiting for this album for a while and now that it's out I'm loving it. The album met or exceeded all my expectations. I took a 6 hour road trip the other day (the day the album was released)and I played this album the entire way, and with every listen I loved it more and more. <br /> <br />Pearl Jam is pretty much the last band left from what was a great era of music (early 90's), and thank God they're still doing their own thing and not \\"going techno\\" or anything lame like that because the music these guys are making is amazing. No corporate BS, no plotting out the music for the pop-radio-sucking masses, no hype. Just heartfelt, well written tunes have something to say. Speaking of which, PJ really lays it down on the Bush Administration here (\\"No more upset mornings/No more trying evenings/It's the American Dream I am disbelieving./When the gas in my tank feels like money in the bank/I'm gonna blow it all this time, take me one last ride\\").  <br /> <br />The album opens with a killer track in \\"Life Wasted,\\" then moves into one of the best PJ singles in a while with \\"World Wide Suicide,\\" and continues on with the heavy up through one of the albums standout tracks, \\"Marker in the Sand.\\" \\"Parachutes\\" is a really cool acoustic number that paints a picture of tiny men toppling to the earth in little parachutes. \\"Gone\\" is another stand out track here, as well as \\"Inside Job,\\" but my favorite has to be Eddie's lamenting Mazzy Star-esque plea for a dead loved one to return in \\"Come Back\\"--brilliant song. <br /> <br />Whether you're a fan of the band, or just looking for something that will give you a real rock fix, this album will not disappoint. Can't wait to see them tour this album--what a show that's going to be. <br /> <br /> <br />
B000002U82|5.0|Some albums have a collection of fantastic songs and they add up to a very good album....but they still don't make the realm of a musical masterpiece. And why is that? because a masterpiece is Gestalt....that is, it is more than the sum of the parts.  <br /> <br />Listen to the individual songs off this album and they are good, but you know of better songs by other artists. Listen to the whole album though and those individual songs mix and combine to form something that can never be gained from the individual songs. A concept, a composition that binds together so tightly that you cannot seperate the individual parts. <br /> <br />Greatness is hard to define but you know when you are in the presence of it. Sit back and listen to the whole of Dark Side Of The Moon and you will realise that this album has that je ne sais quoi that all bands dream about. It is quite simply a masterpiece.
B000E6GBV2|4.0|...I enjoy this album immensely.  I first heard some hype about Band of Horses on Insound or something, and ordered their tour cd from Subpop.  That cd has demo versions of 3 songs off the full-length, and 3 live songs.  The demo versions definitely got me excited to hear the full-length, but in retrospect, I kinda like the rougher versions better in some ways.  I think the lo-fi aesthetic really served the songs well.  That being said, the full-length album didn't let me down at all.  The product description is fairly accurate- Ben's voice is definitely reminiscent of Doug Martsch and Wayne Coyne, and if you like Built to Spill or Flaming Lips, I don't think this would disappoint.  I'm not a huge fan of either of those bands; I think Band of Horses have their own thing going.  Definitely not \\"alt-country,\\" but he songs give a feeling of yearning for wide-open spaces.  The feel is maybe more reminiscent of Neil Young, but with more of a pop sensibility.  I would recommend this to most anyone who enjoys music.  It's something I have to be in a particular mood for, and I guess my one complaint is that they don't stop and breathe too much on the album.  Maybe because it's their first album- there's definitely a sense that they're trying to fit a lot of ideas into one record.  That's a pretty small complaint.  I think this is worth picking up for \\"The First Song\\" alone.
B000ETQRCM|4.0|El nuevo  CD  de PEARL JAM  es realmente excelente y lo situo de una vez como  entre mis preferidos de esta espectacular banda , ademas PEARL JAM  es mi banda preferida de todos los tiempos y sin lugar a dudas han creado un gran trabajo musical lleno de buen rock y de sonidos que me lleva varios a?os a tras cuando comenzaban y fueron en su momento la mejor banda del planeta por sus inolvidables TEN , VS Y VITALOGY. canciones como Comatose, Life wasted, World wide suicide ,Army reserve, Inside job y Big wave son realmente epicas y de lo mejor en los ultimos tiempos.Salud a todos los fans de PEARL JAM
B000EULJLU|3.0|Well, here we are approx. 6-months after Tool released this mediocre album. I gave it a long, fair chance to impress me more than it did initially. Don't get me wrong, there are some GREAT! songs on here. Unfortunately, this release lacks the depth, and effort of previous works. If you peel away all the filler b/s, and useless intros... you're left with a nice gem called \\"Rosetta Stoned\\". Now your saying to yourself, well this guy is an idiot, because there are atleast 2 other Tool cd's with \\"filler b/s aka useless intros\\". Yes, I realize. Those albums, however balance themselves out with more actual lengthy songs to support the \\"noise\\", whereas '10,ooo days' just falls short. I think we could have used atleast one, if not two more decent songs. I'm sorry but \\"wings part 1 & 2\\" (which take up approx. 1/3 of the CD are waaaaaaaayyyyyyyy too drawn out. Could have shaved it down to 1 actual decent song IMO. And overall, they don't \\"blow my skirt up\\".. so to speak. <br /> <br />To summarize my true, overall impression of this CD, is that it's good. Compared to \\"lateralus\\", or \\"aenima\\"... it's complete garbage! \\"the pot\\" makes me want to hang myself... funny thing is I actually liked it a bit at first. It's official, Tool's first mis-step.
B000EULJLU|5.0|I am guessing that a lot of the people that wrote negative reviews for this album will either come to regret their review or they will come back and write a positive review under a different name.  Anyone who listens to Tool enough knows that their albums tend to take shape over time.  Anyone who is disappointed with this album should give it some time.  Those of you who have said that this album is full of \\"filler\\" are forgetting that Tool produces albums not singles.  They are one of the few modern bands that build album integrity.  I am looking forward to letting this album take shape over the next couple of years while I wait patiently for the next Tool CD.   <br />     Those of you that are saying this album is Perfect Circle-esque are ignorant.  Not that I don't like A Perfect Circle- I do, but if this sounds the same as A Perfect Circle to you, your ears might be broken. You might be better off spending your money on DVD's than CD's.  Try Brokeback Mountain, it'll be right up your alley. <br />
B000EMGAGW|1.0|This album is terrible. Mobb deep should never have signed with g-unit. Their beats, their flows are going downhill and it's sad to see because i am a fan of the mobb. 50 you are ruining rap.
B000EXZKQM|5.0|I caught a few episodes of \\"Legends of Jazz\\" before buying this, so I knew I would like it. Some of this has not been shown yet by PBS in my area, so I didn't know if the ones I hadn't caught yet were going to be as good as the earlier ones. Well, it turns out that the remainder of them lived up to my expectations. I really like the Kurt Elling and Al Jarreau version of the classic \\"Take Five\\" and the Robert Cray and Keb Mo collaboration on \\"The 12 Year Old Boy\\". The only thing I'm disappointed about is that there is no Roy Hargrove on here. Hargrove is my favorite living trumpet player and I really enjoyed his playing on the first episode. Oh well, you can't win 'em all.
B000EULJLU|3.0|It seems like everyone says \\"give it time, it'll grow on you\\". I did and it didn't. After listening to this CD a few times over in different places I've concluded there are 2 ways to listen to this CD. The first makes this CD horrible, and that's listening to it in a car or somewhere you can't capture every single sound on every track. The second way of listening to this CD still isn't that great, and that's being somewhere almost completely quiet. I have found that there are a lot of little sounds that can't be appreciated unless you're wearing headphones or in a sound proof room with the volume cranked up.  <br />     Overall, this album is not very good. They had 5 years to put this together and they could only make 5 actual songs. That's ridiculous. If I wanted to listen to something to relax and meditate to I would go purchase something just for that. When I buy a rock album I expect to hear rock music. I know what everyone is saying, \\"but it's Tool. They're unique and special. You can't compare them to other rock bands\\". That's crap. You can and you should. This cd isn't a wonderful masterpiece, it's a band who couldn't think up enough material to make 11 songs so they plugged in a bunch of slow, repetative garbage to fill up 30-40 minutes. <br />     So there's my take on the bad, now for the good. There may only be 5 actual songs on this album, but those 5 songs are very good. I enjoyed every second of them, but for anyone who's reading this my recommendation would be: if you have itunes then I'd suggest you go on there and only purchase tracks 1, 2, 5, 8, and 10. Perhaps track 4 if you want somewhat of a song. It's 11 minutes long and the first half is just noise and a couple guitar riffs being repeated. After 5 minutes of that the songs starts and it's decent.
B000F0UV0E|5.0|My wife Jae and I are eclectic in our musical tastes, e.g., classical, jazz, rock.  Now and then we encounter a \\"keeper\\" performance--this is one of those.  From the first to the last track you will not leave your seat.  Disparate partners in song?  Perhaps, but the sum of the whole is greater than the parts, and the parts ain't too shabby if you've followed both careers.  Tickets already purchased for their Chicago concert.  Just buy it and enjoy.  Nothing more needs to be said.
B000EMGAGW|3.0|Love Mobb Deep since \\"Me and My Crew\\" (check the The Large Professor Remix of \\"Peer Presure\\" too) on Juvenile Hell. Then The Infamous storm I remember openin The Source and seein them give The Mobb 4 1/2 mics (and thats when u could trust the source now i wouldnt recommend that ish) I knew it was over then, Hell on Earth first five tracks was crack rock it kinda slowed but finished strong then one of my fav albums from these boys Murda Musik the consistency was that of The Infamous album. Next The Infamy album where the commercialism kicked in but it still had enough Mobb sound to appeal to their fans; but we knew what was coming Amerika's Nightmare well the tru fan's nightmare anyway, this was a definite low point because they really was goin for that commercial sound but songs like \\"Shorty Wop\\" and \\"Neva Change\\" we knew the Mobb Deep of old was in there some where but u cant hate u got to remember they got to eat too so the transition was expected (I JUST HOPE ALL OF YALL THATS HATIN ACTUALLY BOUGHT SOME ALBUMS, CAUSE IF NOT THIS IS UR FAULT -SERIOUS TALK)but the album was just off. Now Blood Money I GIVE IT 3 1/2 STARS at least the sound is consistent, honestly if u minus tracks like \\"Creep\\" and \\"Backstage Pass\\" its a good Mobb and G-Unit album u cant lose sight of the G-Unit influence. Even though I'm not a fan of the whole G-Unit they do have the occasional gems (like 50's \\"Ski Mask Way' hardest track off his last album). But they (G-Unit) did help The Mobb fine tune that radio friendly sound so for the original Mobb Deep fan IF U CAN FIND THE ALBUM ON SALE UNDER 12$ IT'S WORTH IT just to hear the Money Mobb. I'm just hoping that M.O.P keep their sound and use only the G-Unit name to sell their albums lets cross our fingers my people I think I might go OUTTA CONTROL on that review stay tuned!!!!!!-Thee Music Man
B000AP04OM|5.0|I think the sound of music is, if you excuse the term, a sign of contradiction. Just reading here a few pages of commentaries one can see how different people's reactions are to it, some people loathe it with a passion that is fascinating to me, I, who love it with delirium. <br /> <br />Going over some reviews and comments from the sixties, you can find people who have seen the movie hundreds of times and their conclusion is that it's because it really helps their psyche in a similar way that a therapy would. Indeed, I'd say a 90% of the people who adore the Sound of Music don't find the words to express or understand the reason. But obviously, they keep on watching over and over because there is a positive essence that affects them in a nurturing way. The movie brings into spotlight purity and happiness as something totally possible and independent of personal circumstances. One can see in Maria, as Julie Andrews herself said, the person you'd like to be if things wouldn't be so rough in their own lives. Maybe that is why Julie's performance in the movie is timeless and fresh: so sincere and real, she really *wanted* to be Maria. <br /> <br />As a big fan of the movie, I've found myself seriously reflecting upon one question. Does it deserve the place it has in my heart as the best movie ever? I am torn at the question, because I find myself comparing it to something so disparagingly as Citizen Kane, the movie that is heralded by most critics circles and serious polls as the greatest movie ever. Yes, Citizen Kane is perfect and genius from a technical point of view. Cinematography and photography are flawless. But it's a shallow classic even if it's perfect. As Ebert said in his comments to the movie, the appeal of the story is to the interest of people in gossiping and intruding in the lives of the famous. So the heart of the best movie of all times is this? This is what is represented by the Number one movie humankind has produced? Deep question indeed. Maybe Itake it too seriously, but truth is I really love arts and I think they should be taken seriously cause they are some of the few things that will survive long after we all are gone. <br /> <br />Now, although it's a completely different genre, the Sound of Music is Art. It's the movie that contains the most perfect balance of beauty I have ever found in any other film. The beauty of the soul of Maria, the positive ethics the story has, the joy that is underneath has nothing of sugary as many shallowly purport, but instead it's a soundless song by itself. The lovely and simple score with it's unforgettable songs is just natural because so much energy and youth as it is transmitted by the movie cannot be contained and bursts out naturally. The scenery of Austria gives the beauty a character and truthfulness. It's like a master painting that transmits and communicates directly even with the less sophisticated of the spectators and manage to make a direct bridge with their heart. <br /> <br />The script is what keeps it all together, while it's not complex it is not superficial, it has humor, irony, and fast paced wit. <br /> <br />It all put together seamlessly makes up for, what for me personally, is the greatest movie of all time. If indeed in one thousand years nothing is left of humankind, maybe The Sound of Music would by itself be a testimony of what is the best of the human spirit. That is love, beauty and art. <br /> <br />This is something I am very thankful for.
B000002H2H|5.0|This is truely a Metallica Masterpiece.  From the fast, hard punching beat in Fight Fire With Fire, to the more methodic sound of For Whom The Bell Tolls, truely an amazing CD to listen to.  I highly reccomend any person with any musical taste to get it.
0671027387|3.0|This is a good book, but not so much when you compare it to his religious thrillers.  He does much better in Angles and Demons and Da Vinci Code than this one.  Yet is is still a good book.
0321344758|5.0|Not much too add beyond what many of the other reviewers have said, except that it was a real pleasure to read such an approachable book, and get so many good ideas in such a short amount of time.  Note: this isn't a book about theory. It's about what works and doesn't work in practice and that's it. Krug gets right to the heart of the matter on every point. If you're looking for detailed discussions of web design techniques and why they're good or bad, this is not the right book for that.
B0002EXH5O|5.0|This record is fast intense with great music around every corner. Every song is very unique, and the added tacks makes this album a must have for any metal fan.
B000E6UK5K|4.0|A bit of context: I've been listening to Floyd since the early 80s and most of the time favor the classic works. My favorites: Animals, Wish You Were Here, and Dark Side of the Moon. I enjoyed the two newer albums from the 80's, and listened to them often for several years, but still, I'm one of those people who believe it just doesn't quite measure up. A little too electronic I think....<br /><br />Now for the review: most of the tracks I warmed up to after a few days worth of listening. Only one or two tracks still leave a bad taste in my mouth, though none are \\"bad\\" per se. Overall it is a *very* mellow collection, with a lot of subtle points and welcome memories that come flowing back. Little sounds and effects that you immediately recognize and take to. It's not a clone but the influence here is unmistakable and there's no attempt to hide it. If you're a true fan of the old Floyd, you will most likely find at least a few tracks on this CD that you really enjoy, and will continue to enjoy over time.<br /><br />The obligatory radio DJ track -On and Island- is enjoyable but not the best song on the album by a long shot. I consider it a look into Gilmour's mindset as the album begins; sort of sets the mood. Other tracks vividly harken back to earlier times, while maintaining their own style and interest. This isn't a plate of leftovers served 30 years later. More like an old recipe dusted off and changed to reflect some new ingredients. The Blue and Then I Close My eyes are are both very good, as is Smile. Smile -once you really let it wash over you- will send chills down your spine even though it's as mellow as can be. It's just a very rich song lyrically and musically. Possibly the best on the album.<br /><br />There's also a little bit of the modern flavor in there, most notably \\"Take a Breath\\". However this song falls short of its 80s predecessors. The early part of the track, with the chanting \\"take a breath\\" bit, and the blatant edginess just seem forced. It doesn't fit and is pretty much fluff as far as the way it was written IMO. Catchy, but very simplistic and repetitive. Reminds me -in concept, not sound- of Robert Plant's solo stuff. Tries very hard to fit a style that you can't really relate to in the first place, and then fails on a musical level anyway. Off kilter, out of place, take your pick. It just doesn't belong here IMO.<br /><br />The earlier noted \\"Close My Eyes\\" track is a very low-key and enjoyable intstrumental, as is \\"Red Sky at Night\\", which has a sound I would descibe as a sort of mix between Wish You Were Here and Division Bell. Hard to describe but I like it. The point is, there's some great instumental tracks and interludes to be had here also. And everything just flows together except that one track. Just uncheck Take a Breath in your iTunes list and let the whole thing loop.<br /><br />Last but not least the use of orchestral music in this album is well executed and worth listening to (carefully). As you might guess, this album is best appreciated in a relatively quiet, peaceful moment. And it will grow on you a bit as well. Don't expect to have an aural orgasm after the first listening, and don't bother trying to \\"get it\\" with kids running around or at work. Give yourself space and time to enjoy it properly, and it will reward you a little more each time you listen.tty much fluff as far as the way it was written IMO.

B000E33VWW|2.0|While I expected to be interested..this film turned out to be everything I had expected with no real revelations and a tiring and mocking performance by the oscar winning lead..
B000EULJLU|4.0|Ok come on guys it's not THAT bad.....I mean it's tool they have some good songs on there, but the question is Could have done better? and the answer is YES!!! don't get me wrong this has alot of great work but I dunno it's just not tool....the first 2 songs are good but then it goes instrumental and stuff....nothing wrong with that but I think they overdue the instrumental intros alittle.....I hope Tool has a next album and if they do they can see some of the mistakes they made on this album and make some changes....and go back to 100% Tool!!  Maynard I guess has been with APC for a long time he still has alittle bit of APC maynard in him....I think if maynard stays with tool long enough then about the time they make another album then he will go back to the Tool Maynard that everyone knows and loves....he still has it in him just listen to Vicarous and Jambi and acouple of other songs (can't name them off the back, sorry)....THIS is pretty good if U give it a chance....we will have to go with this and all of tool's other amazing work until tool goes back to the tool everyone loves....it's not the end of tool, just give it some time
B000AMJG4Y|2.0|This is a horrific movie even by anime standards.  The plot is shallow and character development is weak.  This movie picks up 2 years after blah blah blah.  Its the same old spin.  The evil corporation \\"Shinra\\", the ex SOLDIER who has lost all faith in anything, the helpless children, barf!  The list goes on and on.  I can't believe they took so long to come out with this trife poo.  Nothing like watching one boring combat scene after another thats so predictable even with FF standards.  I couldn't wait for it to be over and I felt like I was watching a dumbed down version of Gasaraki (which I also gave an F).  It was a waste of 90 minutes.  At first I was thinking maybe I would like to play the game again but after watching it, I changed my mind. Its been a long time since I played FF7 and thankfully they have a remininence feature to remind you about what happened.  I now realize how butt ugly the graphics were back then and wonder what I ever saw in it.   <br /> <br />The FF series has really never advanced or gotten better.  Every game is the same thing.  Its like eating the same thing over and over again.  It just gets old and that taste that you used to crave, makes you gag.  This stale movie is no exception. <br /> <br />Will I recommend this to anyone?  NEVER!
B000EULJLU|5.0|Tool's new album title almost captures how long most fans feel it took for the band to finally produce an album after 2001's Lateralus.  But it was worth the wait.  10,000 Days is perhaps a bit more atmospheric or \\"experimental\\" than Tool's previous work but that doesn't necessarily make the album of any less quality.  In fact, the overall sound of the album is very solid, and the heavier tracks balance very well with the more ambient-oriented songs.  The overall experience of the album creates a very etheral kind of mood that evokes a trance-like experience for the listener that few other bands can achieve.  Tool's music is more of a psychological experience than entertainment, so similar to a new book or a new piece of art or a good film, 10,000 days takes a bit of digesting before you can truly appreciate its merit.  The technical ability of the band members is very good and does not seem contrived like many other \\"math/art metal\\" bands seem to make music.  There is no pretentiousness in Tool's new album.  There is a feeling of mystical force to the sound, but it is very genuine and controlled, and the band has a strong command of their music now more than ever before.  10,000 Days - STRONGLY RECOMMENDED. <br />This is one of the few bands left that really care about making art elevate to new heights.
B000E97Y6K|4.0|This film could have been a contender for movie greatdom, but slips up with miscasting of the two male leads, and a sappy overplay of the inter-species love story that suggests that Anne Darrow (Naomi Watts) is seriously kinky.  No doubt she needed years of therapy after the monkey took the dive.   <br /> <br />The Skull Island sequences of this classic, \\"which is not just an adventure film,\\" were brilliant, and the overall approach to and reworking of the original film was very successful.  The movie appears to be full of \\"insider\\" cinephile jokes - especially the Jack Black charachter's send up of Orson Welles (including mugging with a pipe), and the probably deliberate parody of the (equally sappy) death of the character Jack's death as he slips into the ocean at the end of the film \\"Titanic.\\"  Also note some humorous re-use of the original film's dialogue as \\"Carl Denham\\" shoots scenes from his film.  I suspect that there are many other such hidden jokes in KK. <br /> <br />Overall I give this four-and-a-half stars...
1591396190|2.0|I would not consider myself an astute strategist, but with the little reading and exposure to organizational strategy that I've done and been a part of over the past years, this book is nothing but a horse of another color.<br /><br />This is a reiteration of work done by Michael Porter 25+ years ago.  For an HBS book, I was incredibly disappointed.  The authors use `fun' little metaphors with bloody oceans and smooth sailing blue waters and thus create a smoke and mirrors show to convince potential customers that they've developed a new unprecedented theory of business strategy.  All they are doing is pedaling a differentiation strategy pioneered by Porter with an emphasis on innovation (one aspect of the differentiation set - e.g. branding, pricing, market niche).<br /><br />If you've never read anything on competitive strategy, then it should be a fun read.  If you have, don't waste your time.  If you believe this is really a NEW strategy on which your organization can capitalize... then I've got a great deal on a bridge.
B0002OERI0|4.0|Why, why, why is this cd NOT AVAILABLE without cursing? This cd ROCKS, but you can't buy it edited anywhere. Even gangster rappers offer edited versions of their cd's. I love to rock, my kids love to rock, but only without the profanity. It is a great CD. There must be an edited version out there somewhere. I can usually depend on wal-mart for edited versions of cd's, but they don't carry it edited because it doesn't exist. It gets played on the radio without cursing. At least the record label could offer an edited version for those of us with kids (and morals). AND: Leave out the politics and Billie Joe-go easy on the eye liner. <br /> <br />
B000E97Y6K|4.0|The task was to remake the original 1933 King Kong! This monumental undertaking was to update this film to today's standards and viewing habits. The one director pegged for this undertaking was the \\"Lord of the Rings\\" trilogy director Peter Jackson. This three time Academy Award (LOTR) winner was also a big fan of the original. So in a nutshell he had an unlimited budget. (Cost to make was $250 million)<br /><br />Naomi Watts (Ann Darrow) portrays her character with vitality and vigor. Adrien Brody (Jack Driscoll) and Jack Black (Carl Denham) play supporting roles to Watts and Kong. But Kong (Andy Serkis) steals the show (which he should) and falls for the vitality of Ann Darrow.<br /><br />The special effects make this film come alive with real life feel for that 1930's era. The sound and sound editing cannot be disputed for receiving Academy Awards. Kong's movement and expressions truly characterized Peter Jackson's attention to detail. And I was unexpectedly surprised by the Skull island inhabitants. They are not your ordinary, friendly type original movie islanders. All I can say is that they are very scary.<br /><br />I truly enjoyed this version of \\"King Kong.\\" Peter Jackson has honed his film making skills. And is becoming a must see for any film that he touches. I recommend purchasing the two disc widescreen version. The second disc contains the \\"Post Production Diaries\\", \\"Skull Island: A Natural History\\" and \\"Kong's New York, 1933.\\" I am now a big fan of Peter Jackson.
B0009FU0ZQ|5.0|Simply put, this was one of the most refreshing and enjoyable TV movies in decades.  It had the courage to take its own sweet time getting to where it wanted to get (and yes, you must have an attention span longer than 5 seconds to enjoy this).  Selleck is simply great, and the wonderful feel of coastal New england just oozes from frame to frame.  I am so looking forward to more if these gems...maybe now I will actually keep the TV!
B0002KQNZO|5.0|Hard bop, soft bop, shoobop a doolop. I don't know where one style ends and another begins and I don't care. I do know that this is not that dinnertime, does-the-cheese-go-good-with-the-wine? kind of jazz. And I know that Art et al takes your ear hairs and wraps them up in knots with this blistering set. \\"Free For All\\" is raw yet contemplative, like the thoughts bubbling through the mind of the man saddled with the task of cleaning up the blood after a boxing match; it's like acid eating through the petri dish and it's the mood crystallized and cast in neon on the side of the highway, dripping into the gutter and leaving goodies for you to pick up and ponder in the daylight. It feels like cloth on flesh melting. It's that moment, if you will, where the Hulk realizes where he is and what he's done ... before he starts shrinking back down to human-size.
B000E97HIA|3.0|I must say, after the freshness and success of Musicology, I was hoping for something as appealing from Prince's latest effort. Alas, it seems that Prince's style now sits uncomfortably between the latest commercial rnb drivel and whispery memories of his former glory. \\"Lolita\\" sounds embarrassingly out of date, while \\"Incense and Candles\\" sounds like it could have come from any commercial rnb debutant.  Saving graces include \\"Black Sweat\\", a genuinely edgy track that reveals glimpses of inspiration and originality; \\"Satisfied\\" is definitely the aural sequel to Musicology's \\"On the Couch\\"; and \\"The Word\\" personally does something to me, I don't know, Prince's meandering voice hits the spot with this track. And \\"Beautiful, Loved and Blessed\\" is your standard chart-pleaser.  Unfortunately, the rest of the tracks take a little more effort to enjoy than is comfortable.
B0001Z52RU|5.0|This movie was exceptionally well written, great acting(Ashton Kutcher made up for that horrible piece of crap Dude Where's My Car with this movie)great effects,well paced and intelligent. I was rivited from begining to end with this movie. This is by far one of the best movies to come out in a long time. I love this movie and you will too.
0393320928|5.0|This book was great.  It won't be the literary testament of the 20th century but the stories are thought-provoking, humourous and edifying.  This book dwells a lot on the Challenger incident and the ensuing investigation.  There is a fair amount of detail there which may not interest some readers but this reader found it to be a good mix of technical information into a very human story.  I have actually not read Surely You're Joking yet so I cannot compare it.  In short, recommended to anyone interested in the whole Feynman persona and more generally, the inner workings of a genius.
0743454537|2.0|Right, not wanting to run the risk of what many other reviewers stated, I WAs extremely dissapointed with this novel; especially since the premise was of intriguing and important value. I think the central flaw with Picoult's writing is that she asks difficult questions but, then lacks the courage and trust in her characters, abilities, and talent to actually try and answer them. Some of the characters were simply too shallow, stupid, gimmicky, or down-right contradictory to the extent that readers' emotional investment in them is slowly curbed and retracted. Personally, Anna was the only character that I truly felt in touch with, since she was the helpless poor victim of her mother's obssession in saving her terminally ill daughter; now, the obssession was a bit too much for me and I'll get to that soon. Now, to the characters' \\"emotional turmoils\\", obsessive behavior, and all-together non-sensical attitudes towards the situations they are faced with. This will include a few spoilers for those who still want to read: <br /> <br />1- Mommy gets out of law to take care of children, she's been out of it for years, yet she has no trouble bouncing off like she was present in a courtroom only yesterday. <br /> <br />2- Mommy also only cares for Kate, with Anna being the neccessary donor, and Jesse simply a lost cause. Yet, she drowns in grief and show real emotion towards her daughter only after she dies? What about when she really needed her mother's support? <br /> <br />3- Daddy forgives arsonist son's crimes, although it endangered human beings, and are serious state felonies. He 'punishes' him with a hug! <br /> <br />4- Kate seems to love Anna, but in her 'earliest memory' she's trying to kill her sister...WTF?! At least she could've offered some explanation on why and how come, but Jodi offered nothing. <br /> <br />Although the story is +400 pages, the plot seemed thin, Anna files a lawsuit, Mommy turns into super-lawyer, Daddy becomes supportive of Anna, Jesse continues making fires, Kate continues getting sick, Daddy screws Anna up in the end, Anna wins lawsuit, but then she dies in a reincantation of a biblical story about how fate governs all life...was that what the story is about? I thought Jodi meant it to be about making hard decisions, obviously, she has a hard time getting what she's writing about!  <br /> <br />Now to the ending. For some weird, vague reason, I thought the final chapter was from another book; like it had absolutely nothing to do with the previous chapters. It was disintegrated from the rest of the story, and I felt that we were in another setting, when I grasped what the whole commotion and confusion was about I realized that this was too much coincidence to be real. Anna finally had a choice with her body, she could be on even grounds not only with Kate but with her parents as well, yet Picoult decided to dodge the new complication, throw the towel, and kill off Anna...very sad, and contrived doesn't even begin to describe this escape from the question that the book was founded on in the first place. <br /> <br />In a word, very disappointing, good concept but Picoult seems to have a fundamental flaw in executing her stories as she would like them to be read.

B000EJ9MTW|3.0|OK, here's something to ponder. Say you love this movie you saw three decades ago and now some hot-shot decides to release an updated version and it's pretty much the same thing, but you can't help yourself; you're the first to jump at the chance to credit the director for being faithful to the original film. So here's the question: Isn't that just like applauding a monkey for doing a good job of staying in the lines when it's tracing an image? It's hard not to like Wolfmother when they're such a well-inked carbon copy of the annointed Black Sabbath (with a sprinkling of The Who and Led Zep -- and, OK, \\"Joker & the Thief\\" sounds like a heist on latter-day White Stripes -- to alleviate their comfortably numbed conscience). But should you applaud a sucker-fish for latching onto a shark at an opportune time? When there's so much crap floating to the surface, it almost seems like a moot point. You feel like giving them a pat on the back for appreciating good music. And I won't lie, I'll go and see them when they play live. So what's my beef? It's not like Sabbath hasn't gotten the respect it deserves. You can thank Lester Bangs for that. And didn't MTV help Ozzy get off his flubber meds? It's just that if we're going to forgo experimentation and give into the Brave New World, I'd much rather go back to beating on rocks, if for no other reason than that my particular rock will not have first been molested by a corporate pimp. Illustrated another way, let's pretend rock bands are dog breeds. You know that it takes inbreeding to build prize winners. And so it is with A&R slobs scouting in the vacuum. But inbreeding is the afterbirth of creation, and if we're all comfortable wearing the same genes, then we're ascribed music that sounds alike, looks pretty, does cool tricks and suffers horribly because it's not fit to live a healthy life.
0201626632|2.0|I am a little shocked at the positive reviews that this book has received. It was on this basis that I decided to get the book.  <br /> <br />I have just finished undergrad and will be starting a graduate degree next year. I have known for only about 2 years that this was the path I wanted to take. In that time I have asked questions, read papers carefully, decided what was effective and what was not, watched people I admired at work and attended conferences. Based on my experience almost all of Feibleman's advice is painfully obvious.  <br /> <br />While I was reading the book I had the overwhelming feeling that Feibleman is of the impression that the naive mistakes he personally made will be made by everyone and that it was the responsibility of his mentors to have stopped this from happening to him. I suppose in some fields it may be easier to miss the subtle skills that will help you succeed but in mine (biology) all that is needed is a willingness to pay attention to the people that are leaders in your area(s)of interest. If you are curious about the book or feel clueless about what a research career is all about, you may find something useful here. Otherwise, just start asking some good questions of the people around you that have been there. <br /> <br />I also found Feibelman sexist. He gives a number of scenarios in the book and notes that he has used initials to protect identities and to avoid attaching a racial designation to the individuals. He does not offer the same courtesy for sex. The one scenario involving a woman was a story of someone whose motivation was soley based on her need to please her father, while the men grappled with more academic problems. He also very pointedly assignes a male gender to \\"management\\" throughout the book.
B00000099Y|4.0|I love this CD... god there are some amazing songs on this CD. I understand that tool kinda wanted a murkier,grungier kinda tone to the recordings, which is sweet and all, its just not my cup of tea for an entire album. Overall, great songs, a lot of intermissions I find, but still, great CD, worth a listen.
1932100385|5.0|I loved this book. I have a copy of my own that I return to regularly for information; I donated a copy to the local library; and I have a \\"loaner\\" copy to share with friends.   <br /> <br />Dr. Campbell's book demonstrates that people can take control of their health by making good food choices. We don't have to fall prey to heart disease, high blood pressure, diabetes, and cancer. We can choose instead to be healthy throughout our lives and as we age. Dr. Campbell's professional credentials are impeccable and make the truly radical diet change (for most Americans) that he advocates completely rational. <br /> <br />Some will find parts of this books to be more science than they bargained for. Others will find some of the \\"food politics\\" troubling. But every aspect of this book is well thought out and essential toward the goal of changing the way we think and the way we eat  <br /> <br />In the United States, diabetes is an epidemic. Hundreds of millions of dollars a year are spent to treat the disease. Especially with respect to young children, who are not responsible for their own diets, it's tragic that various government agencies and the medical establishment refuse to avail themselves of this excellent body of information.  <br /> <br />Thank you Dr. Campbell and son for sticking your necks out and saying what needed to be said!
B00003ZKS1|5.0|The first MSG album (1980) showcases Michael Schenker at his best with the help of real studio musicians (not that rag tag bunch from UFO that he left behind to do this project).  This is THE pivotal album that got me into hard rock with flashy guitar solos.
B000BVQ9JO|3.0|Don't get me wrong, i love the strokes and i started loving them because of 'Is This It?' and loved them with 'Room on Fire' although it was different in minute ways to the debut but they still kept true to the style they originated with.  <br />'First Impresions..' still has The Strokes essensce but lacks the strokes punch, there is a sense of doom and death in a lonely world filled with minors and sharps and no love.  <br />The songs are more complicated and adress a whole new set of themes.I think i expected too much from the album hearing juice box, seeing as has similar sounds to Is This It and Room on Fire i thought it represented the tone of the album as a whole. <br /> <br />I don't know i feel that its missing something, mabey the cheery numbers they had before, or the optimistic, innocent carefree lyrics where being alone together was it, mabey the short,sweet,searing leads and the fact that life was life and when things get hard to explain that you had to try your luck and make it as fun as you can.I guess this album is one of those u can either just take it or leave it. <br /> <br />
B0000DD7NL|1.0|The version thatI have seems to be different than the other reviewers, I have one that has the subtitle of \\"A Documentary Film\\"  with this diffences noted, I found this to be one of the worse DVD's I have ever purchased! <br /> <br />This product might have been great for the under 30 group but for this older viewer it was a complete let down.  I was expecting to hear music and to see her perform.  I was not interest in her stay in an expensive middle eastern hotel, and junkets through the street of this city. <br /> <br />I wanted to watch her sing, even with her excellent talent she is still to young to have such a product released purporting to be her life!  I would have rated this zero stars if this had been a choice.  This DVD should have been like the CD and I would have been a much happier follower of her music <br /> <br />I have just purchased her most recent DVD. I can only hope that this one is only music and performance, instead of talking and walking around a location?
B000EULJLU|4.0|****1/2/***** <br /> <br />The number of terribly written negative reviews for this album has me wondering, are these reviews for the 10,000 Days that was leaked on the internet or for the actual album?  <br /> <br />I'm sure by now it's apparent to everyone that the \\"album\\" that was leaked on the internet is a fake, completely different and far worse than the actual 10,000 Days. <br /> <br />I purchased the album thinking that I knew beforehand the material that I would find on the disc. And when I read the song titles on the booklet I just assumed it was the same stuff I had heard weeks prior. But I purchased the album anyways because I am a fan of this band and wanted to support them, despite what I considered to be throw away material that I had downloaded. <br /> <br />When I heard the opening moments of Vicarious I was shocked. It wasn't what I had heard previously! And as I listened through the entire album...it was ALL different! <br /> <br />This album is outstanding, and as usual with Tool, well worth the wait. Every non-intro song eclipses the 7 minute mark and the musicianship, singing, and production are all excellent as usual. Usually Tool albums take a few listens to really get in to, and this is no exception. <br /> <br />Don't listen to the seemingly endless number of awfully written reviews from pre-pubescent, angst-ridden 14-17 year old teens on this website. In fact, it is a bit of an insult to the band that this is their core audience...But that's a different story. This is, in my opinion, an excellent album from an excellent band, and certainly MUCH better than 90% of mainstream rock that is being manufactured and thrown on the shelves these days. Unfortunately, this is one of the few bands who has a relatively mainstream following and has substance as well. Especially the genre of \\"metal,\\" which...other than a few bands, is comprised of nothing but pretentious garbage and awful musicianship and screaming/singing. Chances are, if you have any/good taste in music, you will like this album and the direction that Tool has taken since Lateralus. Just another good Tool album.
B000EULJLU|1.0|This disc blows. i can't believe all those Tool fanatics that swing from these guys nuts. Every Tool album sounds the same, the production is the same, sounds the same, same rehash riffs. Adam Jones is meticulous in the studio but can't come up with something better than this every 5 years. Maynard thinks he is so ultracool but really he's just an ugly blad guy with a god complex. Like I said, if you've heard Undertow you've heard this crap. Mathmatics have no place in rock Adam.

0375707972|3.0|It is a strange novella, a coming of age love story of a 15 year old adolescent, Michael Berg, falling far an older woman, Hanna, narrated in first person by Michael. As the title implies Michael is asked to read out loud various books to appease Hanna. They have a steamy affair and then Hanna disappears without a trace.<br /><br /> As the story unfolds we learn that she was a concentration camp guard and was responsible for the murder of numerous women and children. During her trial when the prosecuting attorney shows her a written confession and asks her whether she wrote the document, Hanna agrees it to be hers. She was an illiterate and did not want the ignominy. One can argue was it shame or guilt which prompted her to own up to her sins. In the end Hanna redeems herself but at a cost.<br /><br />It is almost impossible to reconcile with the fact that after she was sent to jail for 18 years, the narrator, never bothers to contact her. He sends her book tapes but never writes her a personal note. It defies logic or human nature.<br /><br />Germans for generations would be burdened by the guilt of their parents, ancestors, participants of one of the most heinous crimes ever committed.
B00005JOUM|2.0|**1/2<br /><br />Spike Lee's \\"Inside Man\\" is probably the most commercially viable and least cutting-edge film the maverick director has ever made.  I wouldn't exactly call it a sellout - Lee is as entitled as anyone else to make money off his projects - but it is a bit disheartening seeing Lee aiming his sights and his estimable talents as low as he has here.<br /><br />\\"Inside Man\\" starts out like a dozen other bank robbery tales, with a gang of masked gunmen storming into the establishment and turning the terrified customers and employees into ready-made hostages, then hunkering down for a prolonged standoff with the law enforcement officials outside.  Denzel Washington plays the hostage negotiator whose job it is to bring the perpetrators to justice with a minimal loss of innocent life.<br /><br />The movie deserves credit for bringing a few novel twists to the storyline, but, frankly, most of what happens in this film simply defies credibility.  We don't believe for a moment the goings-on here. Despite a \\"surprise\\" ending and a plethora of Lee's trademark cinematic flourishes, we leave the movie shrugging our shoulders uttering, \\"Is that all there is?\\"<br /><br />Washington does the best he can with a halfheartedly written character, but Clive Owen, Willem Dafoe and the ubiquitous Christopher Plummer aren't given much to do in their various roles.  Only Jodie Foster - playing a ruthless real estate agent inexplicably brought in to assist in the case - seems to be having any fun at all with the film.  She brings a much needed note of high-spirited camp to a movie that really doesn't seem to know what it wants to be.<br /><br />\\"Dog Day Afternoon\\" this ain't.

B000C20VRS|5.0|Let's face it - Scarface is an American classic. For those of you who went to film school, Scarface follows the classic pattern of any successful dramatic work.<br /><br />*THE STAR YOU LOVE TO HATE. Tony Montana epitomizes everything a lead actor should be. He's egotistical. He's violent. He's not very intelligent, but he's extremely \\"smart\\". He's a drug addicted, narcissistic, alpha male drug lord who you just can't help but to like. He has a sense of humor, but he can turn on you on a dime. You know he's bad, really bad, but you want him to win in the end.<br /><br />*THE CLASSIC RAGS TO RICHES TO RUINS TALE. It's the American dream. The movie is long, but you'll never notice. It takes you on Tony Montana's journey from a Cuban \\"political refugee\\" to the most powerful drug lord in the world. And you're riveted by every blood soaked scene. He finally has money, he has the woman, he has the power, but he never quite gets the happiness or satisfaction. Like all classic rags to riches to tales, it doesn't end well.<br /><br />*THE CONFLICT. There are so many subplots in this movie, you must pay attention to keep up. But they all come to a head in the dramatic finale. He loves his sister, but will kill anyone who looks at her twice. His best friend seems to be the only one who has a sense of reality, but he's intoxicated by Tony Montana's power. Montana is surrounded by \\"goons\\" who would kill him to be him, but it just makes his character stronger. You see his self destruction, but you can't turn away.<br /><br />This is one of the best movies of all time. Pacino is SO good, no role he's played in the last 25 years lives up to this one.<br /><br />If you don't have the Scarface collector's edition in your DVD collection, you're not a true aficianado of the art of the gangster movie.<br /><br />5 stars.
B00005614N|5.0|I write this as a Louis Armstrong fan. I respect Duke Ellington, but I haven't heard nearly as much of his output as I have of Louis Armstrong's. My judgment is more about Satchmo's performance here than about Ellington's. <br />I consider this an example of Armstrong showing a musical colleague how much he cares about all music. At this point in Armstrong's career he had committed most of his repertoire to Long-Playing vinyl. It's easy to forget that, in 1961, many of the classic 78s of the jazz era had still not been transferred to LP, and it is easy to forget that such transfers were not necessarily cleaned up for playback. This is my roundabout way of saying that, in re-recording much of his own material, Armstrong, throughout the fifties, was playing music he'd played since the twenties. He and the All-Stars, his small combo founded in the forties, were well attuned to each other and waxed some of the greatest performances of Armstrong's career, live or in the studio. But Armstrong had only been recorded with Ellington very rarely previously. I am not certain, but I think there are literally a couple of songs he and Ellington played live on the air in the late 1930s, and I wouldn't be very surprised if they played once or twice without being recorded at other times. But they'd never really sat down and worked out a set until 1961, when they were both in New York at the same time and had the opportunity. The songs on this album were not songs Armstrong played in his stage shows and he didn't make records of them. But he was not caught short here. He knew this material, either because he learned it for this project or because he'd been listening to this music for years, and he understood it. The marvelous thing is he clearly cared for it. Armstrong sets aside his personality for THE GREAT SUMMIT, or, more to the point, he set aside everybody else's expectations and interprets the lyrics in all their somber beauty. His trumpet is earnest here. His trumpet is always full-bodied, but on this project, Louis Armstrong is not, if you will, playing the showman, but expressing, through his trumpet, the music of another genius. It may be the most giving performance of his career. And that's saying a lot, given that his career is full of high peaks. <br />I sometimes put this CD on when I go to bed at night. It sounds like New York City. There's a breeze, some laughter in the air, and cameraderie. Two musical innovators commenting on what they see, for all to hear.
1400034205|5.0|Somerset Maugham is one of my favourite writers, there is no other writer who can make laugh out loud as oftem as Maugham. He has a way of presenting human beings as foolish, ridiculous and enslaved by there own vanity, yet always seems to possess the self awareness to see himself in the same terms. <br /> <br />This is an excellent book to read if your at a bit of a crossroads in your life and considering going away to \\"find yourself\\". I would also recomend \\"of Human Bondage\\" if you have fell in love with the wrong girl. \\"The moon and sixpence\\" if you wish you could be an artist. One of his most underated books \\"catalina\\" is one of my favourites as well
0767810856|2.0|What a disappointment!  I remember Siskel and Ebert raving over this romantic comedy.  Romantic, maybe, but comedy - never.  Very predictable plot from beginning to end.  And Rosie Perez was truly offensive.  A few times I couldn't understand what she was saying.  There is no way I could buy that she and Cage's character were attracted to each other.  Maybe critics liked this movie because it had no sex, violence, or rough language.  Although Cage does get shot in one hold-up scene.  It was just that you knew what was going to happen every step of the way.  I am beginning to Like Cage more and more as he ages. [ spoiler] I was really disappointed at the end to find out that the real people whom this story is based on were always happily married to their original partners.  Either they shouldn't have changed it so much or they shouldn't have let us know about the real story it was based on.[end of spoiler]  But Fonda and Cage were very engaging together.

630521610X|5.0|Scream: <br /> <br />Scream was the movie of all movies my senior year of high school.  It was all most people could talk about for the longest time...  Presumably because of how realistic it was.  This wasn't a monster fest.  This was a real person, with a really messed up mind going around killing high school students!  What more could a teenager who loves scary movies ask for? <br /> <br />This movie is more suspense than horror, I think.  Yeah, there's blood and a little bit of gore, but that is greatly outweighed by suspense that builds up to the reveal of who the killer is.  This was one of the first movies that really kept me guessing - although I sort of had the surprise ruined for me by my best friend who assured me that I would think the killer was \\"hot\\" whenever I got to see the movie.  But even though she told me that, I still got tripped up in my thought processes when I was trying to put the pieces together.  Only a good suspense movie will do that to you! <br /> <br />Let me not forget to mention the excellent levels of comedy relief that this movie has.  Even though there's a masked murderer roaming their community, the characters in this movie still manage to deliver some pretty funny dialogue.  My favorite characters have to be Dewey and Gail Weathers!  Although Stu was also pretty funny... <br /> <br />In all, I thought the story for this movie was completely original (at that time), and was very well acted, directed and produced.  I have seen all of the Scream movies, but I really don't think either of the sequels even comes close to the greatness that the original movie achieved. <br /> <br />Every lover of horror/suspense has to see this movie.  It should be a requirement. <br />
0156027321|5.0|Now I understand what all the fuss has been about over this prize-winning book! It took me awhile to get around to reading \\"Life of Pi,\\" the genre-bending novel by Yann Martel. I thank my friend, Andrew Cvitanov, for recommending this book to me. Depending upon what page you are on and which of the one hundred chapters you are currently ingesting, the book feels like a tragedy, a comedy and a romance. Yann does a magical job of bringing us on a journey - a voyage, if you will - of deprivation, intrigue, challenge, terror, mystery and epiphany.<br /><br />I will not give away any of the interesting and surprising plot twists, but I will reveal that the author leads the most discerning readers down some interesting philosophical paths - exploring issues of metaphysics (the nature of reality) and epistemology (how do we know what we know?). He uses rich language of metaphor and allegory as he holds a mirror to the human soul and asks us to examine - to compare and contrast - ourselves with the rest of the created order.<br /><br />At its core, this is a deeply spiritual book. On a technical level, I take issue with some of the underlying theology of the author; he is more syncretistic and pantheistic than I am comfortable with in my own belief system. But those theological differences did not prevent me from marveling at Martel's adroit ability to weave a tale that poses deep existential questions.<br /><br />Martel, speaking through the voice of his protagonist, Piscine \\"Pi\\" Patel, makes some stunning and extraordinary observations about animal behavior, including the human species, that by themselves make this book a worthwhile read:<br /><br />\\"Sometimes I got my majors mixed up. A number of my fellow religious-studies students - muddled agnostics who didn't know which way was up, who were in the thrall of reason, that fool's gold for the bright - reminded me of the three-toed sloth; and the three-toed sloth, such a beautiful example of the miracle of life, reminded me of God.\\"<br /><br />\\"I never had problems with my fellow scientists. Scientists are a friendly, atheistic, hard-working, beer-drinking lot whose minds are preoccupied with sex, chess and baseball when they are not preoccupied with science.\\" (Page 5)<br /><br />\\"I'll be honest about it. It is not the atheists who get stuck in my craw, but agnostics. Doubt is useful for a while. We must all pass through the Garden of Gethsemane. If Christ played with doubt, we must we. If Christ spent an anguished night in prayer, if He burst out from the Cross, `My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?' then surely we are permitted doubt. But we must move on. To choose doubt as a philosophy of life is akin to choosing immobility as a means of transportation.\\" (Page 28)<br /><br />This is a terrific book to read along with family and friends. My edition of the book contains an appendix with twenty-three intriguing discussion questions about the book and its meaning.<br /><br />Enjoy.<br /><br />Alreminded me of God.\\" <br /> <br />\\"I never had problems with my fellow scientists.

B000002J6H|5.0|Who the hell is writing this review for Amazon.com??  What kind of moron would assert that Stills is the least accomplished and that his personality only comes through on his solo work? This \\"least accomplished\\" member of CS&N was actually the workaholic and control freak that dominated their albums, played most of the instruments, and probably drove the others off with his maniacal perfectionism.  His \\"personality\\" is by far the strongest stamp on their albums.  How far off can such commentary possibly be? <br /> <br />As for this album, it is by far his best solo album.  I'm still waiting for a follow-up.

B00005JLKB|5.0|Season one was a simpler time in Smallville. Clark and Lex were still friends, and there was Pete. The only reasons Clark couldn't get close to Lana were that she had a boyfriend and that she wore jewelry made from Kryptonite. Then there were the meteor freaks, people we all may have known from our own lives, only in Smallville they get infected by meteor rock and turned into mutants with super-powers. You got to like Bugboy and the High School Football coach whose hot temper set things and people on fire. The Pilot episode was brilliant.    <br />   We're late in season 5 now and things are so much more complicated. Some characters have gone, and the personal relationships are getting very muddled. Still enjoying every episode but  sometimes missing the old simpler formula, the way things were back when Clark was still in High School.

B000F0UV0E|5.0|I was sitting in a bar on the Tuesday Imus had Mr. Knopfler and Ms Harris on. The TV is turned down so the satelite music is heard. I'm a regular and the six sitting with me are to. When Harris and Knopfler began to play the satelite music went down and the TV sound went up at my request. The bar fell silent at the sound coming from New York to Kansas.  <br />I have been a huge fan of both artists for years. I am in heaven with this CD. One criteria I have for buying music anymore is not to have heard them on the radio. Radio stopped playing anything new by Harris and Knopfler a long time ago, which is fine with me. These two are mavericks who go their own way relying on their fans, like Ms Harris pointed out in a recent interview. I'll keep on buying their CD's as long as they keep making them. <br />Anyone without this CD is missing out in a big way.  <br />
B00008OP6Y|5.0|There is a mood that Bergman creates in his films that is special.  An intention seems to run so deep beneath the surface that we can only peel back layers of understanding but never arrive at the final solution.  One suspects that this intention is beyond Bergman himself who only provides a vehicle for its imperfect expression: a stage for the unpredictable interaction of autonomous concepts; which in Persona include ambition, sensual love, envy, fate, and madness.<br /><br />Liv Ullman's retreat from a savage world - her attempt to step off the merry-go-round - ends unexpectedly as the fate which has been frustrated in expressing itself through her persona begins to work through her caretaker, Bibi Andersson .  Ullman is left to watch, horrified, as an intrinsic piece of her identity is appropriated by someone else.  The self-immolation of the monk that Ullman had earlier retreated from is encountered once more as a kind of bonfire of her own vanity.  Fate is the consequence of a person's actions, and it catches up with Ullman who has run away from the responsibility of raising her son.  Andersson's own approach to an unwanted pregnancy is shown to be a more responsible reaction to life's challenges, yet it haunts her and provides the catalyst for the operation of Ullman's fate.<br /><br />Did Bergman intend to communicate all this at the outset?  I don't know or care.  This is moviemaking as a higher calling: an attempt to create an experience so rich that it leaves an indelible impression on the viewer, and changes him for the better.  It is mythmaking.
0786852550|4.0|I think \\"The Amulet of Samarkand\\" was a very good fantasy.  Somehow, however, it hardly even seemed like fantasy, despite the constant references to djinni, magicians and `other places'.  It's told in alternating perspectives, 1st person told by the djinni Bartimaeus and 3rd person told from the perspective of the young magician, Nathaniel. The story was good, if a little classic, in a good v. bad sort of way.   I won't go into the story line here and ruin it for you, but I will say it is engaging and fantastical, foreign but very easy to relate to.  The dijnni is witty and scathingly honest but still endearing.  You can't help loving his prickliness. Nathanel is young, good hearted, somewhat naive but very ambitious.   They make a great pair.  Good characters, good story, great book.
0786867973|4.0|Ever since I saw Nigella Lawson on TV, I'm captivated she makes things look easy.  I would love to buy her other books however I don't cook and I'm an AVID BAKER! so I mostly collect baking books. And I think that food that she cooks I admit seems quite weird for my taste, I guess its because most the ingredients she uses is no available in my country.  But I still bought this book is its mainly on baking which I absolutely adore.  Her recipes are quite unique and more importantly taste good I love making her banana bread coz since I live in a tropical country we have bananas all year round so sometimes we ge way too much bananas and its a pity just to throw away the overriped ones, so banana bread is the answer! <br />I also like it that in each recipe there's a paragraph with tips, recipe background and the way she wrote it was like the talks in the telly which I really like.
B00000J2SP|1.0|I consider myself a Rainbow fan, but this album was just horrible.  Rainbow really peaked with \\"Long Live Rock and Roll\\", but with this release, Blackmore abandoned all rock and roll and went for the pop jugular.  It was like listening to Survivor.  The lyrics were uninspired and the songs were paint-by-number.  Especially annoying were the keyboard playing by Don Airey (God I miss Tony Carey).  I was wondering why \\"Spotlight Kid\\" sounded so familiar, then I realized it was \\"Kill the King\\" warmed over.  I literally threw this cd out of my car window during the second listening of \\"Magic\\".  Ughh.  The trouble with Rainbow is that Blackmore changed the line-up constantly so that the band never really aged together, like Zepplin or U2.  The reviewers who loved this album were brought up on pop tunes, not rock and roll.  Sorry, but this album ain't rock and roll.
B0006FO8RA|5.0|Britney Spears is smart, articulate, intelligent, beautiful, exciting, radiant, pure, wonderful, responsible, and talented.  This CD is a testament to her inner strength.  This lady has staying power, and I'm so thrilled to hear about her second pregnancy.  Good luck on the second baby, Brit!
0071373586|5.0|I'm always concerned about, how can I live in my clients mind where clients are consistently depending on my specialty, while dismissing my competitors cluttered \\"me too\\" approach...    I want to define my service and cater to a certain audience, as well as define my competitors as being all over the place or out of touch in a certain area, whereas I can specialize in one area...    Positioning is for leaders who desire winning, not for losers who get high on marketing ideas to get attention like a child...    When I teach my students spiritually how to live young and flourish in our program, they see the difference in their lives, not growing old on social security at church.     Dr. Garner
B0001GF2DS|5.0|the story of 3 violent men chaseing after gold hidden during the civil war is still the best of the three spaghetti westerns clint made. with this two disc set and footage restored this looks so great that i keep both my old and new copy of this movie,i like it that much. a must
B000A6T1HC|5.0|I was left speechless when I first listened to this CD.  A powerful, emotionally intense interpretation of some fabulous, albeit almost forgotten, oratorio pieces.  As a big opera fan, I have really enjoyed listening to it. To Cecilia and to whoever came up with the idea to rescue these musical wonders in her amazing voice:  Bravo, Bravo, Bravo!
B000E6UK5K|1.0|This year, David Gilbore of the so-called \\"legendary\\" band Pink Floyd released his zillionth solo album, and it FLOPPED BIG TIME everywhere around the world!  While people are digging Kelly Clarkson, Chris Brown, and the Pussycat Dolls, America completely ignored this borefest of an album, which also got a two star rating by Rolling Stone.  Just avoid and wait for Nick Lachey's new CD.
B0008ENHTE|5.0|this is the one,until the road warrior,the best car chase in a movie ever made. i say that because this movie is much more. frank bullitt is a cop who takes no stuff from anyone,bosses,bad guys,or anyone else. because of this he is given the job of keeping a witness alive till a big mob trial. of course the mob,and \\"others\\" don't want that and try to kill the witness. frank must now find out what is going on and get his hands on the shooters before anymore people die. <br />    simlpe story,great car chase,and steve mcqueen at his coolest,does it get any better!!!!
B000EULJLU|4.0|10,000 Days is an aptly titled CD, as for any diehard TOOL fan out there, it has certainly felt like we've waited that long since Lateralus came out for new material. But was the wait worth it? Well, yes and no.<br /><br />There is no mistaking that yes, 10,000 Days is TOOL. The sound of the guitars, the complex and long songs, and the double-sided lyrics are all part of the trademark TOOL sound. This time around, the music has mellowed significantly. There are still heavy guitar riffs, but the music has turned much more towards a melodic, almost spiritual sound than previous CD's. This isn't neccessarily a bad thing, and I'm not going to start with the whole \\"sell out\\" bullcrap some people throw about when a band changes its sound. The musical difference is actually pretty nice and fits in well with TOOL's way of changing their sound from CD to CD.<br /><br />My main issue with the CD is the lyrics. While there are still the deep, complex lyrics Maynard James Keenan has come to be known of, several tracks are much more straight forward and less poetic sounding than previous TOOL releases. There are two songs that make it quite clear that they are about drugs, and one that leaves no question about the band's opinion on america's voyeuristic obsession with tragedy. While these tracks are not terrible tracks, the straight-forwardness of the lyrics feels very out of character for MJK.<br /><br />Also, many of the guitar riffs felt recycled. I swear the opening riff of Vicarious has been used on both AEnima and Lateralus, and the guitar solos rarely add up to much more than long drones of one or two distorted, high pitched notes.<br /><br />Still, these minor imperfections do not ruin the CD. 10,000 Days is still an enjoyable seventy five minutes of music, even though it feels at times like the band is simply going through the motions.
B00005NTNU|5.0|i like clint eastwood just like i like john wayne. two sides of the same coin i guess.this is a great collection and i am happy to have it in my collection. <br />1.dirty harry= the first and still best finds harry up against a crazy who works the system as he kills and does other bad people. 5 stars  <br />2. magnum force=harry is after killers who ARE cops. good movie but harry and the killers aren't that far from each other. 4 stars. <br />3.the enforcer=this one ties with sudden impact with me as the least of the movies. 3 stars <br />4.sudden impact= clint looks tired and not into making this one, the only dirty harry movie he directed. 3 stars <br />5. the dead pool=clint has a glint in this last dirty harry movie. he has a good time and it makes this one a great way to say goodbye to harry with
B000EULJLU|5.0|I love TOOL. They are an amazing band and always break musical ground. When i first got this cd i'll admit i was a tad dissapointed, but after listening to it a couple times i found that i couldnt stop listening to it. This is a great cd, although some may say it is a lateralus 2, i think that it is a combo of both lateralus and aenima. Overall a brilliat cd.
B000EULJLU|5.0|The hiatus between albums was great but not necessarily void of progression. As we all know Maynard stayed busy with APC constantly honing his voice (whilst recovering from a wrecked larynx a la 'Ticks and Leeches') into a more sonorous acoustic instrument to convey his cynical other-worldly sense of humor. You can immediately hear this in the opening track 'vicarious', which can be taken as a keen jab at America's obsession with negative and gorey media. Move on to 'jambi', a well constructed song in almost every way, you get the best of Tools heavy guitar riffs and pounding drumming couresty Mr.C and you can surely hear Maynards growth and maturity at this point. 'wings for marie' is the first part of the infamous two-part serenade that began in lateralus, a powerful message about MJKs late mother. The albums namesake being the second portion. The ambient sentience of these songs combined should bring any true Tool appreciator to the brink of tears it's so moving. 'the pot' displays MJKs renewed vocals in all their glory, and his everpresent vitriol towards the ingnorant and self-proclaimed. 'lipan conjuring' is an tribal and other-worldly reprieve from modern music but is a welcome glue to the oncoming preternatural ' lost keys (blame hoffmann)'. 'rosetta stoned' follows its latter introduction brilliantly, bringing deeply desensitized accounts of a life changing abduction, in one's mind, and the inability to cope with the lack of evidence to persuade his doctor's of it's validity. Very humorous and moving again, typical MJK. 'intension' displays a distinct spiritual maturity which is only a precursor to the fully developed anthropomorphic 'right-in-two'. With a striking message to the bullheadedness of humankind, one can surely hear residual waves of 'emotive' on this track. 'viginti tres' leaves the album on that indinstict wordless path as tool has so often done. A mindblowing album.
B000EULJLU|5.0|This album is fantastic. But let me tell you that if you're expecting another Lateralus, you'll be dissapointed. Listen to it with an open mind and enjoy. <br /> <br />

0553378384|5.0|I bought this book as one of my first astrology texts and loved it then, but did not realize what a wealth of information was truly in the book. Based on where the nodes are, Jan Spiller tells you what you need to move towards to fulfill your life's destiny and the tendencies that you need to leave behind that are from former lives, that which we feel comfortable with from the past. Since becoming more involved in astrology, I have found myself going back to this book several times to remind myself of what I  need to learn as well as to understand others who have come into my life. It also describes the attitudes one has regarding relationships, work, etc. An invaluable source of information for both the beginner as well as the advanced.
B00000DLVA|5.0|This was quite a shock for a Cardigans fan who starting listening to them when First Band on the Moon came out.  After listening to Life and FBOTM over and over again, I was not expecting the Cards to go electronic.  But I have to say, I'm glad they did.  They more or less abandoned their original 60's sound; the only song on here that sounds like their earlier work is \\"Junk of the Hearts\\".  The Cardigans have the same uncanny grace that bands like Saint Etienne have, able to switch sounds completely between albums and yet still sound like they've been playing this way forever. <br /> <br />\\"Paralyzed\\" is a great opening tune, I love the lyrics.  \\"Explode\\", \\"Erase/Rewind\\", and \\"Hanging Around\\" are also oustanding tracks.  My favorites would have to be \\"My Favourite Game\\" and \\"Do You Believe\\". <br /> <br />I haven't heard Long Gone Before Daylight very often and I have yet to hear their new one (who knows when it will be released in the US), but I can safely say that I will listen to whatever music they want to put out.  Because chances are, it will be fantastic!
B000EMGAGW|1.0|I'm a long time Mobb Deep fan but I think they lost me with this garbage album..The production is unbelievably wack and the lyrics are mediocre at best..I was waiting for this album for a looong time and I can't even put into words how dissappointed I was after listening to it all the way through...With an album this sorry, they are the shook ones...
B000EMGJM2|3.0|When this CD came out, I ran and bought it because  <br />I loved his debut \\"Van Hunt\\" so much!... <br />But as I listened, I found that there were songs  <br />that I liked that were tight and funky, while others,  <br />which sounded more like demos, left me cold! <br />But I still think that Van Hunt is one of the  <br />hottest new talents out there today...(a genuine talent!) <br />and if only he could get some good promotion and  <br />if urban radio would open it's long constipated  <br />minds and tired playlists and let him, Rashaan Patterson,  <br />Jon B., Anthony Hamilton & Me'shell N'Degeocello in  <br />and upon an urban music public which is starving  <br />for creativity and originality to come back from  <br />the dead...then the world will get to give brilliant  <br />young kats like this a chance to shine, develop and  <br />in the process, awaken a long dead R&B / Urban  <br />contemporary music scene to come forth! <br />HIP-HOP IS DEAD!!....PUT THE FUNK & THE LOVE BACK IN IT!!
B00005NB8J|5.0|It's hard to put how much I like this movie into words. I watched it and was hooked. It's very original and keeps you wondering. Music score is excellent! Characters are just great and addictive, very much like the characters in the book. It's a first rate movie to the end and it was put together well.
6305320802|5.0|Bought this item in April 2006 and don't find the Todd-AO version as bad as described. It looks OK on a 32\\" non-HDTV screen but the degradation is noticeable when run on my computer's HDTV-like 19\\" screen. <br /> <br />The movie is timeless - accept it as Hollywood fluff, sit back and enjoy the outstanding dancing, rousing music that sometimes approaches the heroic, clever lyrics and actors in atypical roles. I wish they would show this in movie houses again as it cries out for big screen treatment. Until then, this two-set DVD will have to do, warts and all. <br /> <br />For the film buff it is worth the price just for the comparison between the two versions. The movie was shot twice to accommodate the different cameras.  Checking them out reveal subtle and not so subtle variations (the opening scene of \\"Kansas City\\" for instance) due to the angles and freshness of the actors and dancers (Todd-AO better in this respect, IMHO). There's also the scene in \\"Kansas City\\" where Will breaks through the packing case -- in CinemaScope he does it right, in Todd-AO only one foot breaks through and he is only kept from falling by Lizanne Truex's quick reaction. <br /> <br />I suggest that on your second viewing, concentrate on the two young girls who form an on-going sub-plot as teens infatuated with Will. They appear in every dance scene and almost attain co-star status yet are referred to only as \\"Dancers\\" in the credits. Pay particular attention to the pixie-like blonde, Lizanne Truex, who is emphasized throughout the film moreso than her partner, Jane Fischer. An outstanding and very talented actress/dancer who unfortunately didn't appear in any other films - a loss to the trade IMHO. She also had three one-liners, which is unusual for ensemble dancers. <br /> <br />Check out my profile's website for my tribute to her as well as the IMDb \\"Oklahoma\\" message board discussion titled \\"Who are the 2 dancers?\\" for recently discovered details about her. Recognition is long overdue.
B000EULJLU|3.0|I have been a TOOL fan from the beginning, and I never thought I'd ever say this, but I think Maynard was confused!  Maynard is the current heavy metal GOD in my eyes, but I think he may have forgotten that this was a TOOL cd, and not A.P.C..  Dont get me wrong A Perfect Circle is a great band, but its not TOOL!!!!!  He didnt put the edge on his voice.  The music is AWESOME, just Maynards anger, and hate that we all have grown to love and fear, wasn't brought out through his voice on this cd.  I will always love TOOL, and anything that Maynard does, but I just wanted, and expected more from 10,000 Days.  The art work on this cd is the best I have ever seen, and definitely worth the money.  Any A.P.C. fans out there that have never heard TOOL before( come out of the rock you are living under!), this is the first album you should get, then try the rest of TOOL's unbelievable past.  In Maynard We Trust!!!!!!!!666!!!!!!!!!
B000ETQRCM|4.0|\\"Pearl Jam\\" shows off Pearl Jam as Eddie Vedder probably always wanted them to be--punky, political, ignored by the masses and embraced by the fans.<br /><br />It's a quirky album, dense and angry up front, mellower near the end. It's not their best album, so a lot of fans and critics will probably give it that backhanded compliment, the good old \\"Best album since...\\" qualifier. And, like all of their post-Vs. work, you have to listen to it a few times to get used to it. But it is worth getting used to.<br /><br />There are, by my count, three Pearl Jams. One produces gorgeous radio-friendly rock like \\"Black\\" and \\"In Hiding.\\" Another's responsible for all the pure angry discordant thrash like \\"Satan's Bed\\" and \\"Lukin.\\" The third frequently mars a perfectly fantastic album by throwing in a track or two of unlistenable junk. (Ever listen to \\"Bugs\\" and \\"Hey, Foxymophandlemama...\\" on \\"Vitalogy\\"? Me neither. I rest my case.)<br /><br />Call them the Good, the Bad and the Boring. Call them what you will, the success or failure of any Pearl Jam album depends on their being mixed in exactly the right proportions--a lot of Good, a little Bad, and almost no Boring.<br /><br />And I hate to say it, but there's just a little too much of the \\"Bad\\" Pearl Jam here for my taste. (There always needs to be some, or else things get a little vanilla, like on that Star Trek episode when Kirk got split into a \\"Good Kirk\\" and a \\"Bad Kirk\\" and the good one couldn't do anything. But I suspect Eddie puts in too much of the \\"Bad\\" on every album, just to throw fans and critics off the scent and avoid being pursued with the bloodhound-through-the-Georgia-swamp fervor of the early 90s.) On the plus side, though, there's almost no \\"Boring\\"--especially not in the first half.<br /><br />\\"Life Wasted\\" starts out pure anger and noise, and it's only mid-way through that it opens a little to let the Good in. As you can probably guess from the title, \\"World Wide Suicide\\" is another angry tune, with more than a little politics thrown in. (This is probably Pearl Jam's most political album yet, but I'm sure you've already decided whether to accept or ignore their politics, so it probably won't make a difference.) \\"Severed Hand\\"'s an angry, funky, propulsive little ditty about drug use; it's a great little tune, but by this point you'll be ready for a breather.<br /><br />Rest assured, the album calms down in the second half. It's as if Eddie decided to imitate Bob Dylan's electric/acoustic split on \\"Bringing it All Back Home\\" but instead ended up doing \\"electric\\" and \\"less electric.\\" \\"Parachutes\\", the first mellow tune, isn't up to the standards of, say, \\"Off He Goes\\" or their other better ballads, but at that point you'll be glad you're not getting an album full of \\"Satan's Bed\\" clones. There are a couple uptempo songs sprinkled in the back end, but by and large it's calmer sailing. In fact, it becomes a little...Springsteen-esque.<br /><br />That's right. Eddie Vedder's deep, dark secret is that he'd probably be perfectly happy as a slightly punkier version of The Boss. Like Springsteen, he fancies himself a working man's troubador; like Springsteen, he's really, at heart, a classic rocker. Eddie sang \\"Atlantic City\\" on one of his ealiest demos and often seems like he'd be comfortable in the Boss's career at any point besides the Born-in-the-USA stratosphere.<br /><br />Hence the anger and abrasiveness on this album. You may hanker for a return to the blissful days of early grunge, when all was still wrong with the world but at least all was right with music, when Pearl Jam ruled the airwaves. You may want that, but Eddie never did.

B000060MMI|5.0|I deliberately seek out new music, and this band is probably more mainstream than most of what I listen to.  I don't listen to any particular genre, and in fact the main thing I'm looking for in a CD is a sound that is unfamiliar, like nothing I've heard before.  I make a habit of listening to one new cd a day at work (from the library) and this was one of the few keepers.  I don't understand the comparison to the Pogues and Dropkick, neither of which I heard before I came to Amazon to buy another FM CD.  To me, FM has a sound that is unique--at least on this CD, which is all I've heard so far.  My first thought was that it was a Celtic punk band--in other words, a novelty or a joke.  I still think it plays a bit like that, sort of like a musical experiment which the experimenters are having great fun with. <br /> <br />Anyway, I'm just writing this review because I'm not a fan, I'm not particularly drawn to this category of music, but this is still one of my favorite CDs.  This is one of the only CDs I listen to where I listen to every track, in order, and I enjoy every bit.  At first I thought all the songs sounded too much alike.  It's undeniable that there's not a lot of variance here, but even that grows on you; if you listen to it enough--and I have--you start to appreciate the subtle differences that exist among the tracks, and the even subtler transitions that occur from track to track. <br /> <br />To show my tastes in music, my favorites are:  any cd by Louis Prima with Sam Butera and Keely Smith; the Dirty Dozen Brass Band (best CD:  Buckjump); the Romanian Gypsy band Taraf de Haidouks (if you like Drunken Lullabies, check out Taraf de Haidouks, particularly their song Return of the Magic Horses, if you can find it online); the Stanford a capella group Talisman; and lots of other more obscure titles, and usually individual songs, not whole CDs. <br /> <br />Enjoy...
B0006399FS|5.0|U2 is one of the best bands in rock history because they are so passionate.  'How to Dismantle an Atomic Bomb' is characteristic of what they can achieve when they channel their passion well.  This C.D. may become known as the pinnacle achievement of their later works.  It is consistent throughout, and, like 'All That You Can't Leave Behind,' they skillfully master their new evolutions of sound.  Still, it isn't as good as 'Achtung Baby' or 'The Joshua Tree,' but it so cohesive musically, that in some ways, it is more satisfying than any of their other albums.  And also like '...Can't Leave Behind,' they do leave behind the inconsistencies and meandering of 'Pop' and 'Zooropa'.      The album starts off full throttle with \\"Vertigo,\\" one of their best songs ever.  The passion is nearly answered later with beautiful and mesmerizing \\"City of Blinding Lights\\" and the musically muscular \\"All Because of You\\" (complete with a Bono scream that is nearly as transcendent as Roger Daltry from the Who).  Their passionate venue is extended with other fine songs: \\"Miracle Drug\\" and \\"Yahweh,\\" which has Bono singing tenderly and powerfully in alternate verses.  As propulsive and hypnotic as the recordings are, \\"Love and Peace or Else\\" provides a heavy dose of hard rock to give the C.D. more weight.    The album bursts with well-polished thrusts of sound, but it is framed by tender moments as well.  \\"Sometimes You Can't Make It on Your Own,\\" a personal song for Bono's deceased father, is a mournful elegy that still maintains a britzkrieg of sound.  Yet, \\"A Man and a Woman\\" is a necessary ballad with its intricate acoustic guitar and pensive lyrics.  The scope of the album is further enhanced with the playful song \\"Crumbs from Your Table\\" and \\"One Step Closer,\\" which borrows at least the mood from the Velvet Underground.    'How to Dismantle an Atomic Bomb' showcases a skillfully crafted, powerfully delivered album that is channeled in a masterful way.  It all comes from an athleticdrummer, a brilliant guitarist, a motivated singer-songwriter, and a powerful bassist who simulates the group's throbbing heartbeat.  This album has all the serendipity of U2's best work.
B000E1ZBGS|1.0|The mini series was so much better. This try at Pride and Prejudice was a mistake from start to finish. The characters in this version of Jane Austen's book, except for Elizabeth and Darcy and Mrs. Bennet, are card board cutouts. If a person is not familiar with the mini series or the book every other character in this movie would make very little sense. The special connection between Elizabeth and her father is missing. Donald Sutherland is a fine actor. He made a dreadful Mr. Bennet. Kiera Knightly had too many nothing closeups that didn't really develop the character of Elizabeth. Matthew MacFadyen seemed too soft to be Darcy. <br /> <br />The dance scenes at the hall in Meryton are much too long and took away time that the movie needed for character development. Too many extras took away the feeling that this was a country dance for the gentry, and not some crowded London ball. It made me feel that because so much money was spent on these scenes the producers wanted to get their money's worth in screen time. <br /> <br />Elizabeth's clothing was dark and dreadful. She looked like she was wearing what a servant would wear for most of her scenes. The Bennent home was shown as shabby. The Bennents had a good income they just spent it all as it came in so didn't save for the future of the Bennent daughters or Mrs Bennent. Because the estate was entailed on a male relative they would be turned out when Mr. Bennett died. That was Mrs. Bennet's biggest worry. Even then each daughter would get a small income. So why show them living like they were in such poverty? <br /> <br />Jane Austen was making a point about society, and how circumstances could change a woman's place in it. This version of Pride and Prejudice misses the mark here too. Jane Austen expanded on this theme with Sense and Sensibility. The 1995 movie version of Sense and Sensibility is also worth seeing. <br /> <br />This Pride and Prejudice was slow and tiresome, and I wondered how much longer? I had read good reviews and thought there must be something better ahead. The silly ending was all there was.  <br /> <br />Buy the A&E mini series instead, and don't forget to also buy the wonderful 1995 version of Sense and Sensibility with Emma Thompson and Kate Winslet. Both the 1996 TV and movie versions of Emma are also worth buying.
B00005JM0B|4.0|Good movie.  Not great.  I wonder how much John Connor prepared to become THE MAN.  He was trying to avoid that fate throughout the entire movie.  Still fun.  First action scene may be one of the top 10 scenes of all time.  No kidding.  20 minutes or more.  Over the top... and great.      Even though Arnold is too old/engaged in his duties as Governor to make another Terminator, this movie definitely piques my interest for a further telling of the story.  It'd be fantastic to see a movie telling the story of the inevitable war between machine and man.      Thoroughly enjoyed this one, though.
B000002AH1|3.0|I owned Live-Evil on Lp when I was younger and though this CD remaster is fabulous, it still sounds like a mish-mash of material.  I'm not crazy about the stuff recorded with the Brazilian chap, these little minature interludes between the tracks compiled and condensed from the Cellar Door sessions sound out of place and out of tune in places. Now that I've heard these a few times, I'm usually pressing the skip button to get to the next live track.  I'm not sure what Teo Macero was smoking (gimme some of that) but there are some HORRIBLE edits in the live material.  The feature review claims this is more focused that Bitches Brew.  That is sheer nonsense, this release is horribly disjointed due to those annoying little interludes with the Brazilian chap.  The tune selection is about as schizophrenic as it could get.<br /><br />On Nem Um Talvez, one of those little interludes, there is a point where it sounds as though Miles has been playing his horn slightly off mic and then suddenly turns and blasts this one note right in front of the mic. The singer is slightly out of key here making for an extremely uncomfortable moment for those who's ears can appreciate staying on the note!  From an engineering perspective, it sounds wretched and amature-ish to me.  Note to those who \\"love\\" this stuff:  This emporer was wearing no clothes at this particular moment.<br /><br />While I'm a big fan of McLaughlin's work with Miles, it doesn't do much for me here.  I'm thinking the band is probably better on the Cellar Door Sessions on the sides where McLaughlin is absent.  His playing doesn't sound particularly  thoughtful here, it sounds like he's just playing licks as fast as he possibly can. I hate to be irreverent since so may people love this release, but the guy sounds pretty sloppy (on this session)to me (I'm a life-long guitar player.  I'm no John McLaughlin but I know sloppy playing when I hear it).<br /><br />Gary Bartz and Miles's playing is amazing and I really mean that.  The improvisations are about as hot as it gets.  Jarrett, Henderson, and DeJohnette provide an incredible foundation to all that is going on here.<br /><br />Airto!  Mmmmmm.  Not so much. I get tired of Airto trying to whack, pull, bash, shake, and tinkle everything he can get his hands during every second the tape is rolling.  Dude.  It's ok NOT TO PLAY once in a while. His whistling during the opening track while Miles solos is just plain annoying.  He starts wailing like some Porteguese fisherman who has a big crab attached to his big toe by the claw that is chowing down on his foot.  \\"Waaaa la duh luh duh de laaaagggggghhhhhh!  Waaaaah duh luh luh du luh laaaaaaaagggggh!\\"  This occurs in a couple of the pieces, even smack dab in the middle of one of Mile's incredible solos.  He also has the annoying habit of shaking those  sleighbells of his while some of Jarrett's more intense improvisations are in progress.  It's very distracting.  He keeps shaking this thing that sounds like a box of Good-n-Plenty... Theatre size!  Much of what he plays sounds totally out of rhythmic context.  Some might find this energetic and exciting but I find myself wishing Airto would just STFU most of the time.  Contrast this to Airto's playing on the recently released \\"It's About That Time\\" Live at the Fillmore, March 7, 1970.  Airto isn't so intrusive on that recording.  I do like Airto's work with Santana and Weather Report.  I just find it obnoxious and annoying on Live-Evil.<br /><br />Jarrett's playing is amazing but I can't stand those nasaly little shrieks of joy he makes when he feels he's played something very cool. Surely they could have edited that stuff out. Really irritating.  He made an entire career out incredible playing accentuated by those nasaly, joyful shrieks of his.<br /><br />The artwork selected for this release (though painted by a white Swede who converted to Islam) is overtly rascist (turn it over) but then Miles always did have a problem with lumping all of us white folks into the same group of \\"white, blue-eyed devils\\".  I love Mile's music but this was a particular annoyance. Judgement coming from a man who fathered illegitmate children in all corners of the globe and all points in between is just ridiculous.<br /><br />Yeah, this review reads like I hate this disc but I don't.  This really is one hot band!  But there are some problems with the interludes and the inclusion of an unrestrained Airto.  I love Mile's music from this period.  I pull Live-Evil out and play it once in a while and enjoy large portions of it.  I pull out his other material such as Bitches Brew, Tribute to Jack Johnson, Big Fun and On the Corner far more frequenly.  As far as I'm concerned Live-Evil is for the complete-ist and I am a complete-ist.  Maybe the Cellar Door Sessions is better?  I don't know and I'm not going to spend $90.00 to find out.

B00005JL7Q|4.0|I had resisted to see this film mostly because I'm not a huge fan of Hugh Grant, but after watching this film I have to say that I have a new found interest in his films...for he is quite a good actor.  Hugh plays Will, a single man who preys on women left and right to get laid.  He's crude and shallow and, well, he's really really shallow.  Things change for Will when he decides to join a single parents group all in serch of his next date (you'll see why single mothers are his prime choice).  Inadvertantly, through his meeting, he meets Marcus (Nicholas Hoult) who is in desperate need of some male attention.  He lives with his mother Fiona (Toni Collette) who is chronically depressed a bit suicidal.  Marcus, feeling that he's 'hit it off' with Will decides to make the first move and ask Will to spend time with him.  Throughout the process of the film we see that these two 'boys' need each other to become the 'men' they should be.  As Will realizes that he's finally caring about someone other than himself he has to fight to make sure he never loses it.  The film, while delving into the romantic comedy genra once Rachael Weisz steps onto the screen, is really more about finding ones place than finding ones mate.  Will may get the girl, but even more important, he got himself.
0714843377|5.0|If you're looking for quick hits on the creative process -- and/or advertising and brand communication techniques -- Arden has it down. His book (and the one by James Webb Young) greatly inspired the format for my two books -- \\"IdeaSpotting\\" and \\"Zing!\\"  I prefer the out-in-the-open style of fast, punchy information versus nuggets buried in 500 pages of narrative -- especially since most creative folks tend to have rather short attention spans!
0316921173|5.0|This is an exhausting, stimulating, infuriating, and altogether remarkable book.  It is a story about addiction, to both traditional substances (e.g., alcohol, drugs) as well as some unexpected ones (e.g, tennis, information).  Wallace has imagined a very near-term future-one, in fact, that we're already living in since the novel was published in 1996-that is populated with more characters and plot lines than any writer should be allowed to put into three books combined.  Scattered amongst the 1,100 pages (including, by the way, about 100 pages of footnotes, which was a fictional first for me), the author does quite a bit of showing off; he is smarter than you and me and he seems to want us to know it.  However, those pages also contain some of the most hilarious scenes I have ever read and that is what ultimately redeemed the experience for me.  It is hard to recommend this book without reservation-how can anyone in good conscience compel you to surrender at least a month of your life, which is what it will take to absorb this magnum opus?-but I can say that it was thirty days well spent on my part.
0071410945|5.0|As I acknowledged in my latest book, \\"IdeaSpotting,\\" James Webb Young wrote one of the most helpful books about creative thinking in the least number of words -- and \\"A Technique for Producing Ideas\\" is the book! Young trimmed away the fat and kept the muscle. Truly a classic.
B00005JOFQ|5.0|Although it's clear that BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN is terrific filmmaking, I was not really interested in seeing it until I heard Annie Prouix interviewed about the project. (It was her short story that the film is based on.) Prouix described how she had wrestled with finishing the tale for years, and had a much harder time with it than she had had with her longer works. (BTW, her book THE SHIPPING NEWS is a brilliant novel and a pretty good movie.)<br /><br />Anyway, Prouix did eventually finish the story, but had absolutely nothing to do with the filming of this movie. And here is the telling moment: Authors are almost always dissatisfied in some ways with the films of their work, particularly when they are not associated with the movie project as creative consultant or some such.<br /><br />Not Annie. She was absolutely floored that the movie had stayed so true to her story's original tone and purpose, and even substantially expanded upon it. (The fact the adapted screenplay won an Oscar for Larry McMurtry and Diane Ossana is a testament to its excellence.) What a story, and what a movie.<br /><br />INTERESTING SIDELIGHTS: BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN is a western set mostly in Wyoming and Texas. But it was written by a woman born in Connecticut, filmed in Alberta, and directed by a man from Taiwan. Go figure.
B000DWMYQ8|1.0|The people who made Chicken Little are suffering from the Carol Burnett Disease - the one where the creators are much more interested in amusing themselves than they are in entertaining the audience.  The musical throwbacks to decades-old tunes will surely not amuse any children in the audience.  Also, the non-stop fat jokes are poison.  I can't recall a single Disney movie, animated or live action, where a character must take such constant abuse.  Again, the creators were merely amusing themselves and not thinking of the effect their bullying jokes would have on some sensitve viewers.   <br />I could hardly sit through the last 30 minutes.  It was horrible
B00005JOFQ|5.0|<br />Movies like Brokeback Mountain are the kind of films that are watched with open mind in order to penetrate the meaning beneath the superficial manifestation of \\"violence\\" that you see. Reality to one is a fantasy to another, and vice versa. To say that \\"this movie was nowhere near the realm of any reality,\\" is also admitting that the only reality existing for you is the one that was formed in your mind. So with respect to other people's reality, that is a fantasy. <br /> <br />Love can be defined in different categories. If you missed the kind of love embedded in this movie, I guess you already missed the love of your life.
1594481717|5.0|This compassionately written book came at a time when I had very serious doubts about my career.  It provided a desperately needed structure to the process of thinking about which competencies I need to develop and how to develop them most effectively.  The book also contains a wealth of citations, which I have also found to be indispensable to my personal and professional growth.
1592401791|5.0|I have read numerous books on the Beatles' story, the individual Beatles' biographies, and about their social lives after the shows ended. HERE, THERE, AND EVERYWHERE shines light on the Beatles' lives as recording artists in the studio, a topic usually untouched in most popular Beatles books. The story line is written with a direct nature that seems genuine because it doesn't seem to sugar coat their image or come accross as tell-all yellow journalism. No, it seems the author Geoffrey Emerick is calling each event as Recording Engineer for the Beatles as he actually saw them, and offers interestingly new points of view as to why the Beatles broke up, when the cracks started to appear in their relationships, and he also explains the immense pressure that everyone involved with the Beatles were under during their career.
B0006FO8RA|1.0|BRITNEY is arguably one of the worst and most overrated singers to have emerged from the western hemisphere.She is a dumb,talentless woman who blatantly lip synchs,does not write her own songs and cant play any instrument.I would rather get Syphilis than listen to Britney and her nonsense.Skip this BOREFEST and get the latest PEARL JAM album instead.
B0002NRQTS|3.0|Presto marks the turning of another corner...a transition between Hold Your Fire and Counterparts. Fewer are the key driven riffs and the guitars begin to return. The melody is there still, but the new waveness has passed into a more laid back, mature piece of work. <br /> <br />I'll start on the weak end this time, and that's that there are about four songs on the record that are fine but nothing exceptional...and they all come in a row from Superconductor (chorus reminds me of Robert Palmer) through to Hand Over Fist. Any one of those songs could be cut and it wouldn't effect the album except make it leaner. Like all `bad' Rush songs, it seems, there are \\"moments\\" and \\"elements\\" that grab you...but on the whole leave you unimpressed. <br /> <br />Being one of the longer Rush albums, in terms of total tracks, it's encouraging that you're left with what I consider seven pretty darn good songs (hey - more than an entire album's worth in 1978..!). Available Light and Scars mark the two unheralded gems. The former has a great dynamic and melody to it...and a lilting part of the chorus that mentions the title that I really like. It's a good reach for Geddy. Scars smacks of Grace Under Pressure with its bobbing, snappy bass line, crystal keyboard accents, and tribal beat. GREAT song.  <br /> <br />Chain Lightning and War Paint each fall into the oft-overlooked category as well. Lighting has a great set of lyrics and a catchy chorus (respond...vibrate...feedback...resonate). Nice tempo changes too. A nice bass line and crystalline keyboard riff drives the verse.  <br /> <br />The title track, Presto, is amongst my favorites too and one of the rare Rush titles that qualifies as a ballad. I would love to hear this done with Alex acoustically at the front of the stage. This would be great to hear live. More strong lyrics again (man, we seem a million miles away from By-Tor right now....and that's quite the good thing).  <br /> <br />This takes us to the most prominent and clearly strongest songs on the record. Show Don't Tell is a driving little number that kicks the album off with intensity and purpose. Love the guitars here. Just a great song all the way around. Nice band dynamic here...playful, riffy, catchy, etc. Finally The Pass is a wonderful tune (probably a top five Rush song for me). I loved it long before I learned the band did too, but was happy to hear that tidbit just the same. One of the most well-crafted songs the band has ever done. There's a great dramatic tension built from verse to chorus and then into this strong break before the tempo drops back down into the verse format again. Excellent. <br /> <br />Generally Presto is a pretty laid back record, but not in a way we've seen before. Rather than subbing guitars for keyboards and teching it up, it's more an exercise in going to a cerebral and melodic place. It's a more mature place this Rush album takes us to, both lyrically and tonally. And I like it quite well. <br /> <br />I'm knocking it a star-and-a-half for filler and excess. This is a very good 11 song disc that's clearly a notch above Power Windows and Hold Your Fire, but it would be an extraordinary (and 4-star) 8-song event with the correct selections. <br />
B000000WJK|5.0|Sheer bliss, a record full of wonder with Nick McCabe's hypnotic, soothing guitars as it's focal point. Richard Ashcroft's vocals accompany rather than lead through this ten track psychedelic voyage.<br /><br />A different beast altogether from the worldwide smash 'Urban Hymns' but if you liked that album's dreamier songs such as 'Catching The Butterfly' or 'Neon Wilderness' then 'A Storm In Heaven' is definitely worth checking out.<br /><br />There are five songs that make this album essential and in my opinion they are 'Star Sail', 'Slide Away', 'Beautiful Mind', 'Make It 'Til Monday' and 'See You In The Next One (Have A Good Time)'. They are all spellbinding, goose-bump inducing jams that (to use a Richard Ashcroft song title!) break the night with colour. Listen to any of these tracks on headphones while on a late evening stroll by the riverside or through a forest or across a wide open field and they capture your imagination.<br /><br />'Beautiful Mind' is the best of the bunch and is a contender for my all time favourite song! It's a majestic masterpiece that I adore wholeheartedly, every note is perfect and every second is awe-inspiring to me. Listen to it at an ideal time in an ideal setting and hopefully it will grab you in the same way.<br /><br />'A Storm In Heaven' is a much-treasured album in my collection.
B000F0UV0E|5.0|Knopfler is the best in my book but I really wasn't a fan of Emmy-Lou Harris until I heard this album.  Two tracks, (This Is Us & If This Is Goodbye[inspired by 9/11]) are deeply moving; one rocks and the other makes you want to cry.  But the rest of the album is a rich mixture.  If you're a fan of Knopfler, this is a must buy. If you don't know Emmy Lou Harris well, this is a great introduction.  Can't wait to see them in concert.
B000EULJLU|5.0|10,000 Days is Tool's latest and arguably best album.  I picked up this CD on Tuesday May 2nd, and have listened to non stop since.  Everytime I press play and Vicarious begins, I always manage to find something new, and interesting creative in most tracks.  From the setup of each track to the lyrics that are contained in them, this album is more than I was expecting from TOOL.  So I find it disturbing, after reading previous reviews, that previous albums Aenima and Lateralus were able to attract so many simple people.  The theme of the album, in my understanding, revolves around the path that leads to the ultimate end, so logically, every song is linked to this common theme.  From the voyeuristic habit we all have in seeing someone else reach the end, to Maynard's description of his mother's journey through that path, to the fatal consequence of setting people against each other in a war environment, the album delivers in giving the listener different perspectives on this subject matter.  Musically, I have read that TOOL just applied Aenima, Lateralus or even APC concepts.  To all those who provided these sort of reviews, do yourselves a favor and listen to those albums again.  You'll quickly change your \\"ripping off\\" stance.  And if listening to those albums again doesn't do the trick, TOOL have been nice enough to include a pair of magnifying glasses so you can take a closer look at the album without making fools of yourselves, although for some, its too late.
B000F0UV0E|5.0|For those of us that have followed either Mark Knopfler or Emmlou Harris throughout their respective careers, know without any doubt that once again there is another gem out there for the taking, a truly brilliant combination. To enjoy this album, all one has to do is be able to \\"feel\\". If one (Amazon Reviewer) has to become so removed from reality (probably numb) due to \\"it's my job\\" kind of attitude, it's time to either pick a new profession or go try and make your own music. There is nothing wrong with being objective but I truly wonder if you were listening to the same album? <br /> <br />Knopfler's and Harris' vocals compliment each other perfectly, Knopfler's unique style is once again brilliant. The quality of the musicians that join them is nothing but superb. The production is flawless. Together, they are able to sustain a constant mood throughout the album which is soley left up the interpretation of the listener whom appreciates these artists and their music and.... the person that just appreciates music. <br /> <br />It has so much \\"feel\\" and \\"heart\\".  <br /> <br />It's good, very good. Enjoy it!
B000EULJLU|4.0|Here's where I'm coming from:  I first learned of Tool back in the early 90's when Sober and Prison Sex were being aired on MTV.  They stood out, for obvious reasons.  I thought they were a tight band that could rock, but I didn't pick up the album at the time.  Then Aenima came out in 97.  Again, the videos intrigued me, but not enough to pick up the album.  Then then singles wouldn't stop coming.  When finally the SIXTH single off the album (insane right?) was being played for the first time on the radio, I told myself, \\"I gotta get this album.\\"  This band had to be taken seriously not only as a metal band, but as an artist.  Needless to say, I was completely blown away by Aenima.  It was one of the few albums I've ever purchase where I was entranced by the filler material.  I returned to the record store and purchased Undertow shortly thereafter. <br /> <br />The four years that followed caused to forget about Tool a bit.   <br /> <br />Then I started hearing rumors about Lateralus and I was immediately excited.  I was literally counting down the days until its release.  As many of you, I purchased it the first day and listened to it on the ride home from the record store.  It took me about four of five listens to \\"get\\" Lateralus.  It seemed very slow and boring the first time and gradually hooked me in with each subsequent listen.  Once I was completely on board, I began to dissect the lyrics, the artwork, the meaning, and hear the album as one body of work and not individual songs.  I also reexamined the videos and purchased Salival.  <br /> <br />When I stepped back for a moment, I realized that I was completely obsessed with this band.  The climax on Laterlus (track 9) was shaking me to the bone. <br /> <br />Then another four years passed. <br />  <br />Now the review: <br /> <br />My first listen is usually a sampling:  I bounce from track to track listening to each of them.  My second was more thorough (in the car), the third was with headphones, and the fourth was again in the car (this time while drinking tea). <br /> <br />There are some good tracks on this album.  Vicarious, Jambi, and The Pot are clearly the most accessible tunes.  To me, they fall somewhere in between Undertow and Aenima and Tool fans should be pleased with them. <br /> <br />Te remaining songs are what have become so controversial, particularly the 17-minute \\"Wings\\" ode to Maynard's mother.  And I do agree with many of the criticisms.  But I think the problem isn't a \\"creative\\" one, but one of indulgence.  The key element in pulling off a prog-rock album is pacing, and this album has some difficulty moving on in certain points. <br /> <br />If I were to edit the album, I would axe track 3 (Wings for Marie) altogether and cut off track 4 at the eight-minute mark.  Rosetta Stoned is similarly overly indulgent.  I would cut that track off shortly after it climaxes (it goes on for three more minutes).   <br /> <br />Doing this cuts about 10-15 minutes off the album and would have made it flow from one track to the next effortlessly without trashing key points in the album. <br /> <br />Other than the pacing (and maybe the ordering of the tracks), the songs are wonderful in their own right.  Track 4 (10000 days) starts out very slowly and develops into this really great, rhythmic bassline, almost out of nowhere.  Track 7 (Lost Keys) is totally haunting.  Track 8 (Rosetta Stoned), at least the first eight minutes, is Tool at its very best.  And Track 10 (Right in Two) is an epic masterpiece not unlike many of the tracks on Aenima. <br /> <br />I agree with one of the commetors below that you should try to listen to it with headphones.  Maynard's voice comes in much better and leads you through this jungle.
B000EULJLU|5.0|This is the best thing to hit stores since those 3D picture things they came out with about ten years ago.  I bought this product with the expectation that it was going to have music or something (I think I may have become confused because there's also a band called \\"Tool\\").  But whatever, I'm obviously not disappointed!  It's actually a 3D picture book with lots of cool photos to look at, many of which seem like they have depth or movement.  There are pictures of all sorts, including a skull with a fetus in it and some guy with weird hair sitting next to a mirror.  Then there's a list of nonsensical phrases like \\"Lost Keys (Blame Hofmann)\\" and \\"Lipan Conjuring.\\" <br /> <br />Don't become discouraged if at first the pictures don't look right.  You must learn proper viewing technique.  I bet you're like me and put the glasses right up to your eyes as if they were glasses.  How else can you explain these 1 or 2 star reviews?  All I saw was two blurry photos when I did this.  It wasn't until the next day that I discovered that you have to take your eyes away from the glasses and look through them from a few inches away.  You'll feel like you're in some sort of 1950's CIA mind-control experiment.  Groovy, man! <br /> <br />My only complaint is that there should be a little more variety in the images.  I do like the occasional \\"scary evil eyes peering into my soul,\\" but I also enjoy pictures of babies dressed up like giant flowers, and cute kitty cats.  I would liked to have seen more of this kind of thing.  But I won't take away any stars for that.  Well, okay, I'll take away 0.348 stars, but it still rounds up to 5.
0790731002|4.0|Batman Forever is often credited as the beginning of the decline in the Batman film series. If I was a bettin' man, I'd say this isn't because it's slow, uninteresting, or void of style, rather because of its lighter approach. With the first two Burton Batman films (Batman, Batman Returns), the atmosphere was delightfully dark. Not to mention the colorful and equally menacing villains. Batman Forever still has that effect, but doesn't drench every scene with the serious, gothic mood that some of the comics and animated series have come to be known for. This makes the movie a bit more child-friendly and leaves out any extra tension to make room for some good old fashioned superhero fun. And what's wrong with that?<br /><br />I hadn't seen Batman Forever in...well, forever. It had been a while, and I was afraid that with my expanded view of cinema as well as Batman that I would find it cheesy and boring. I was pleasantly surprised. I realized why I had enjoyed it so much to begin with. It's an action-packed adventure that never let's up on the thrills. Except for a few scenes that detail the relationship between Batman/Bruce Wayne's new love interest and a few scenes that expand on the story of Dick Grayson/Robin, I found that most of the movie was bursting at the seams with awesome hand-to-hand combat sequences and litterally explosive special effects.<br /><br />One of the best parts of Batman Forever is Tommy Lee Jones and Jim Carey as the leading villains. Tommy Lee Jones plays TwoFace -- the ex-lawyer who after a freak accident on the job burned half of his face into a horrific mess, resulting in psychological trauma severe enough to split his personality right in two, hotwiring his mind for fiendish criminality. Jim Carey plays The Riddler -- an almost genius inventor that after being turned down by his once idolized Bruce Wayne because his quirky mind-reading invention would raise \\"too many questions\\", shifts into a clever criminal that taunts Bats with riddles and subliminal clues. Jones was absolutely maniacal as TwoFace. From his throaty chuckles to his frantic fits of rage, he fit perfectly into the role. So what if it was way off from the comic book takes on the character? It was too crazily cartoonish not to love! Jim Carey -- goofy and comically intriguing as always -- really gave spice to the character of The Riddler with whacky antics and over-the-top manic traits (who can watch that Batcave scene and tell me it's not one of the most amusing scenes in Bat-history?). While Val Kilmer and Chris O'Donell did fine as the heros, the show was undeniably stolen by the hands of these two brilliant actors that really made each scene worth while.<br /><br />In conclusion, I think that while Batman Forever fails to live up to its predecessors, it makes up for it in an exciting and at times campy approach that causes it to teeter on the line between child-friendly fun-fest and adult-friendly punch-n-kick-fest with grace. From the engaging story to the wild performances to the amazingly well-fit score, it ain't no rocket science why this one's a keeper. The key to enjoying Batman Forever is to swallow your comic book ego and simply have a good time. There's plenty of memorable lines and stylish fights to keep you coming back for more, and if you're willing to go up a bit in price, the Special Edition Two-Disc DVD -- loaded with extras -- really adds to the experience.clues.

I strongly suggest you get this book while it is still available at the used bookshops. <br />  Ginsberg claimed to have written this work spontaneously, but this work shows the poem was written over a period of time, and edited.  Maybe he was only referring to the first draft!  It really doesn't matter,but looking at the drafts does give one insight into how Ginsberg created the poem(s) and the development of a classic.

A lot of them are great bands, but corporate products who are there solely to entertain (I won't mention names).  But this group has managed to get by doing what they do without allowing those corporate hands to get too firmly around their waste.  Their music continues to be organic, rebellious, and speak for those who don't get their voices heard in the current state of American politics.  God bless these guys or who knows where we would be right now.
B000E97Y6K|1.0|I guess I'm kind of picky: I like movies that are entertaining. This one has so many faults that I was relieved when it ended. One of those faults is that it took over three hours to end this abomination of a movie. I'll just list out some of the other problems with this movie:    1. Editing - Every scene in a movie should contribute something to the plot or character development. Too many scenes in King Kong were just there as gratuitous action without adding anything to the plot or characters. And the viewer's response is, \\"Here we go again, the characters are going to fight mudpeople, dinosaurs, bugs, Kong, etc....\\" Peter Jackson really needed a strong-minded editor to edit out about half of this movie. Then the editor should have burned whatever was left.  2. Poor special effects - In this age of amazing CGI effects, there is no excuse for unbelievable visuals in a movie, especially one with a large budget and a well-known director. The effects in King Kong are so bad that you can see the outline of the actors against the greenscreen. It makes it really hard to watch an action scene when the viewer can see a visual difference between the actors and the effects. One might expect them to integrate the effects better with the actors.  3. Poorly thought out action scenes - One of the scenes with the bad CGI/Actor integration issues involved the characters running through a brontosaurus stampede. Those Brontosauri were practically stepping on the actors, yet no one got so much as a little bruise from the experience. They should have been squashed like bugs. Although, that might be wishful thinking. In another scene, Kong is fighting off several T-Rexes while carrying Ann Darrow, the female lead character, in his hands like a Barbie Doll. The scene goes on and on, with Kong tossing Darrow from hand to hand while he's swatting the T-Rexes, and then running, ape-style, with his knuckles often hitting the ground for balance and traction. If Darrow were really in his handwhen it hit the ground, she would have been completely crushed. But, at the end of this drawn-out fight scene, her dress wasn't even torn. Granted, this is a sci-fi/fantasy movie, but one would expect some of the physical laws of the universe to hold true.  4. Continuity issues - First there were the mudpeople, whose tribe suddenly dropped off the face of the planet about mid-way through the movie. Did the director forget about them, as if they were some kind of disposable plot device, useful only so long as they presented an obstacle to the main characters? And then there's the issue of transporting Kong. By the time the explorers/film-makers got to Skull Island, their boat had taken such a beating that it was barely floating. And the boat appeared to be smaller than King Kong. Peter Jackson expects us to believe that these resourseful folks somehow managed to get the oversized ape onto this too-small boat. And, how did they get him from the shore to the boat? All they had was one small dinghy that was barely big enough for the landing party. Then, we are to believe that this non-seaworthy boat got the big ape back to New York. Hmmm... no wonder the director chose not to include the boat-ride home in this movie. That's the one scene he managed to edit out of King Kong.    Don't bother seeing thim movie unless you're interested in how bad a big-budget movie can be.
0887307280|5.0|Michael Gerber believes that the reason most businesses fail is because they are started by people that have skill in creating a product, not in running a business. This lack of business savvy causes the majority of startups to fail.  <br /> <br />To avoid this, Gerber tells his readers to work on their business, not in it. He recommends developing a business model that relies on a pre-defined way of doing business, rather than one that depends on your employees. This way, you can ensure consistent excellence from your company without overseeing day-to-day operations.  <br /> <br />The E-myth by Michael Gerber is full of practical advice for operating your small business successfully. I would highly recommend every entrepreneur read this book and apply the principles it contains.

184576045X|5.0|Whoa, dude!  What an exciting book!  I consider myself a mellow guy, but this got even my blood pumping!  It's the story of this hard-boiled psycho dude who's tracking down the person who killed a woman he slept with.  He's pretty broken up over it, because most women just find him repulsive.  Man, it's violent, which is good, because that's entertaining. <br />All in all, I'd say this is the best book I've ever looked at for five minutes, then gotten bored with and torn to shreds.
B000AMJG4Y|5.0|I have been waiting for this movie to come out for 5 years and now after the release date being push back so many times it is finally out and I have to say it is defiantly the best CG movie I have ever seen, it is true to the game and the graphics are absolutely astonishing.  Even if you have not played the game I think it should still be enjoyable because the story is great and if you don't even like that kind of movie the graphics are not something you want to miss.  It is great seeing all of the whole gang from Final Fantasy VII together and every fight scene is a jaw dropper.  I greatly encourage anyone to buy this movie.

B0000549B0|5.0|During the past decade, Hollywood has shown a strong tendency to do movie remakes. Additionally, plans are in the works for many more remakes in the near future. A few of these remakes are either just as good as the original or in rare cases even better than the original. Most remakes are worse than the original and are all too often just plain awful in their own right. <br /> <br />There are some movies that are just about perfect in their original form and as such should never, ever be subjected to the remaking process. One such flick is the 1950 classic Harvey starring James Stewart as Elwood P. Dowd. As to who plays the title role, that is a good question.  <br /> <br />You see, title role is played, at least according to Elwood P. Dowd, by a six foot eight inches tall rabbit named Harvey who is invisible to everyone except Dowd. Dowd is a barroom regular who drinks with Harvey every day and opens doors for his rabbit friend who Dowd refers to as being a \\"pooka.\\" Only problem is that Dowd is the only person who has ever seen Harvey.  <br /> <br />Dowd's relationship with Harvey is most embarrassing for the other members of his family who think that he has flipped his lid. Chief among these relatives is Dowd's sister Veta Louise Simmons (Josephine Hull) who has been assiduosly trying to get her beloved daughter Myrtle Mae Simmons (Victoria Horne) married off. Everytime Dowd talks to Harvey in the presence of a suitor to Myrtle Mae has the effect of scaring off the suitor who thinks that the family is nuts. The same goes for whenever Veta Louise Simmons has a tea party for other older age ladies. This is especially important since these parties are meant to introduce Myrtle Mae Simmons to the mothers and aunts of prospective suitors with the idea being that if the society matrons approve of her, they will talk to their sons and/or nephews about the idea of getting married to the younger Simmons female.  <br /> <br />After a party in which Veta Louise Simmons triedto introduce her daughter to prospective suitors went up in smoke after Elwood P. Dowd showed up and brought Harvey with him and introduced Harvey to the guests, Veta Louise decides that she has had enough. She goes to Dr. Chumley's Rest Sanatorioum and endeavors to have Elwood committed there. However, due to her behavior when she gets flustered and a mixup on the part of the staff, Veta winds up getting committed herself! Eventually, things get sorted out and then Dr. Chumley decides to go after Elwood himself.  <br /> <br />Harvey is a movie masterpiece of the first order. It is well done in just about every respect. It is also a model family movie outside of Elwood's tendency to drink at bars and the fact that there is some unnecessary violence. Harvey contains plenty of slapstick and screwball humor however, unlike most movies of the type, it is very well thought out. If you want a movie for the whole family, then Harvey is a movie well worth considering.  <br />

B00000IWVS|5.0|Buy this disc for the third sonata. Its chopin's best, and she owns it so hard. Her playing of the last movement puts anyone else's to shame, playing the finale with ridiculous speed and most of all, in rhythm. I hate when i hear that ending slowed down, and softened, it sounds like garbage like that. She is unreal.
B00005JOWR|4.0|Thank You For Smoking is a clever story that delves into what righteous morality can turn into if continually reasoned through a filter of moral subjectivity; as well as how reasoning is not always the greatest tool for the argument of right and wrong- but always seems to win the fight regardless.<br /><br />Nick Naylor is a lobbyist for Big Tobacco, he is not only the main character but the hero of this story.  He's quick to the draw and seemingly unbeatable.  He fits the bill as a fighter for justice and the defender of the helpless; we may dislike what the justice is or who the helpless are though.<br /><br />The supporting characters, among many, include his son, fellow lobbyists (alcohol/firearms), a tricky journalist, and a righteous Vermont congressman; all mesh well playing into the Naylor's plot as cartoon characters gravitating so easily into his super human will without much resistance or strength.  There are times when Naylor may seem out of his league or even beaten, but like any superhero he always seems to magically overcome those times without any reasonable answer for why or how it happened.<br />The greatest strength of the movie is the sharp comedic acting of the great cast and clever dialogue move the story to it's climatic final scene of victory.<br /><br />This movie is not far removed from a graphic novel or comic book story: the humor is absurd, the characters are flimsy, and the storyline is choppy, but the truth is found in these ridiculous weaknesses and the overall irony of it all.
B000EULJLU|5.0|A Perfect Circle has nothing to do with this album.  I doubt that Maynard James Keenan wrote one note on this album.  Remember, he's just the vocalist!!!!!!!!  I don't see how people can even compare the two.   <br />This is a great album.  All the things we love of TOOL--technical, emotional, and perfection!!  This album is a unique album, and just like all the other TOOL albums, you'll find yourself coming back for more!!
B000BCKFWK|1.0|The current PC word used by those who object to the unnecessary violence is probably, 'gratuituous'.... I'm not much up on my PC-correctness. To others, it contributes to the film's \\"ambience\\"; you know...  film noir. yeah, right.  <br /> <br />Sam Peckinpah's \\"Wild Bunch\\" and \\"Straw Dogs' \\" violence created about the same stir, impact, and  impression that I've read among the 4-5 star reviews here. And what is Peckinpah's reputation among the young, today? Exactly--Sam who?? (and that meager reputation is well-deserved; film as art, nor craft, didn't benefit from Sam Peckinpah) His films were just as bad; hokey-thin plots and monotonous over-kill violence for its' own sake--sure, it creates an \\"atmosphere\\", and if the viewer needs that element in film in order to consider it 'break-through entertainment' or \\"film noir\\", then I say, \\"If God didn't want them sheered, he wouldn't have made them sheep\\". There's nothing new here; in fact, it's all grindingly familiar in a borish way. The \\"special-effects\\" graphics and video manipulation delivering cartoon-esque visual cinema has been done ad nauseum--\\"Dead Men Don't Wear Plaid\\", \\"Roger Rabbitt\\", \\"Forrest Gump\\", \\"Gladiator\\", are all better examples of like talents used to better results. Mickey Rourke's performance is 'live osmosis'-- he's as wooden as ever. He might as well be Clarence Williams III. His low deadpan monotone spewing 3rd grade dialogue, coupled with action-adventure violence that is deemed 'unacceptable' for TV only means that such dribble can't be viewed for free--but it's definitely not worth even a matinee's price nor 2 hours out of one's life--we gave up after about 20 minutes.  <br /> <br />If imitation is Hollywood's sincerest form of flatulence, Peckinpah should be smilin'... and Tarantino too, for having skinned all the willing sheep from their money. Film noir? More like: film? no.
B00006BTCA|5.0|Well, where do I start? I don't normally review albums but I had to disagree with all the negative reviews! This album blew me away from start to finish. Possibly the perfect debut album. Atmospheric, haunting, beautiful. Yeah, it's been done before, but I'm 20 and I missed most of the 80s. Ignore the lazy Joy Division comparisons! This album was the one that restored my faith in rock music. Highlights are Obstacle 1, NYC and the last 2 minutes of PDA. Antics is not so good, but there is a lot more to come from this band. Regardless of the latest fad, this is timeless stuff! Seriously, I urge anyone who has faith in modern music to listen to this album. This band is one to follow.! Take it easy
B000EULJLU|5.0|I will start this review by stating that in my opinion Aenima is the best Tool album, to me that was their peak. A lot of that was in the production eg. they sounded fairly raw, there is studio trickery but it is very subtle. That is one reason why it is such a good album because it is simply tool playing in a room and frankly for them that is great thing to behold. Another reason Aenima is my favourite is the fact it is more a collection of songs each stands on it's own. They do tie into a whole however and no I wasn't a fan of the \\"noise\\" tracks. Laterlalus was a disappointment for me I do concede that it had it's merits there are some great tracks but the production was a let down. The guitars lacked the bristling distortion of Aenima the whole sound was to produced and lacked the immediacy and punch of Aenima. Also music is about tension and release and frankly (you may not like this) but the standout title track builds to an incredible crescendo and then just doesn't quite deliver. The grudge is brilliant and Schism also. Now onto 10,000 days, yes the cover Art is the most awesome thing I have ever seen on a C.D. and the production is back to form. You can hear that distortion loud and clear. As for saying it sounds like APC I think those people have it the wrong way round APC sound like Tool. Vicarious is classic Tool and obviously the single. The album is doing to me what a good Tool album does at first I was a bit sceptical but certain things drew me in to another listen and then another and now I can't take it off my CD player. Tool are back.
B000ETQRCM|4.0|When No Code came out it was such a huge change from the previous album Vitalogy. I believe that this album fills that gap between them. There is a nice mix of experimentation and heavy rockers on this album. It is a really nice change from the previous Riot Act and Binaural, both of which I didn't enjoy too much. If you want to find out where the band went between Vitalogy and No Code purchase this album.
B000E97HIA|4.0|Returning from his own self-imposed indie music wilderness exile in 2004 with \\"Musicology\\", Prince offers \\"3121\\".  This record seems to be a bit more, I don't know, sexy or fun come to mind.  It seems that Prince made his textbook record with \\"Musicology\\", here he just wants to get down.<br /><br />Some of my favorite cuts are, but aren't limited to: the title track, a deep, hypnotic, funk number, one that resurrects the vocal character Camille from the dead. \\"Lolita\\" is a fizzy, pop number that recalls some of his more pop oriented material. \\"Te Amo Corazon\\" the first single, may've seemed leaden at first listen, but amongst the other programmed work, it actually provides a lush organic breathing space. It truly sounds prettier upon each listen.  \\"Black Sweat\\" draws a falsetto vocal reminiscent of \\"Kiss\\", but an updated hip hop dance element that characterized his \\"Symbol\\" album in 1992. Ironically, he almost comes close to making this the dirtiest cut on the record.<br /><br />Lyrically, it is the same material Prince has always written about, love & sex. Though, for his age love is more the subject on the platter today. His efforts to bring his faith (as a Jehovah's Witness) on \\"The Word\\" sort of just float there.  Musically, though, this is a fun cut.  It could've been pulled from 2001's \\"The Rainbow Children\\" which dealt with similar subject matter.<br /><br />Overall, Prince makes another fun, if tame record that shows that while he may not be the innovator he once was, he sure is better than the slew of those who copied him in his wake.
0425173895|5.0|It is so difficult to write a review of The Murder of Roger Ackroyd without spoilers, however, this is absolutely the best book by one of the finest mystery writers ever. Christie was a master at developing a solid plotline, laying out all the clues for those of us with the gray cells to assimilate them and put them all together. The mystery is one of her earlier ones and is a classic dead body in a room story. Poirot works with Dr. Sheppard, from whose point of view the story is told, to interview all the suspects and at the end puts everything together in a way that leaves us hitting ourselves over the head for not having seen what was right in front of our eyes. <br /> <br />There are those who have argued that Christie cheated on the ending, which has a true surprise twist, but I think that her ending is one of the most brilliant plot devices ever used. She absolutely lays everything out, all the clues are there for us to see. This book is a work of genius from a brilliant writer. <br />
B0000089FS|2.0|From the OBJECTIVE reviewer...this would probably be considered the bottom of the barrel when it comes to Elton LPs if it we'ren't for the fact that the re-release includes the Shep Pettibone remix of \\"I Don't Wanna Go On.\\" It improves the song 100% and actually makes it a good dance tune. It's hard to find anything else worth listening to (Mona Lisa's and Mad Hatters possibly).

B0007Y08QA|5.0|Many movies take us into existentialist nightmares, though most are not this stylish.  You know the drill - lots of black, white, gray and blue, steel, concrete, chrome, and glass, no natural materials, no warmth, no light, only the suffering protagonist.<br /><br />The Machinist falls neatly into this category, but unlike so many of them, it has a point, it is going somewhere, there is an \\"aha\\" moment that makes sense of this descent into hell.  That's worth knowing because the world you enter is dark indeed.  Trevor, the Machinist, cannot sleep, and it is killing him.  As has been reported elsewhere, Christian Bale shed 63 pounds to play this part, 63 pounds he didn't have to spare.  He looks cadaverous, haunted.<br /><br />As we are drawn into his private and desperate existence we wonder, as he does, if he is really losing his mind completely or just having a terribly difficult time.  Both Jennifer Jason Leigh and Aitana Sanchez-Gijon are wonderful, offering tantalizing glimmers of hope.  Part of the intrigue of this movie is that we experience Trevor's struggles as he does, and we begin to suspect some undercurrent just as he does, our level our understanding never gets ahead of his.  We wonder, as he does, if he is the victim of some truly devious conspiracy, there seems to be so much evidence.<br /><br />Then we wonder, as he does, if the truth might be something less spectacular, but far more chilling, much closer to home.  Trevor's world is so extreme, and so relentlessly painful, that it can only be explained by something ghastly, something unthinkable.  It is.  There is nothing funny or warm to be found here, but The Machinist is a brilliant film featuring an astounding performance by Christian Bale.  If you're not afraid of the dark, you will find it riveting.

B0009R1T7M|2.0|Anyone who has the sheer courage to attempt an honest song about John Wayne Gacy, Jr. certainly deserves a second look, unfortunately, when you look again, it's still a train wreck. One cannot deny the touching sincerity exhibited by Sufjan Stevens in his ambitious work, which features highly original and entertaining titles if nothing else. However, the delivery, the voice, the style, and the overall sensibility are cloying, morbid, and dour, a quagmire oozing precious self-pity. Listen to it for a while, then pound nails through your hand for a while. See if you can tell the difference.
B000EOTAM6|4.0|It may well be that I'm simply not \\"sensitive enough\\" to catch the nuance or \\"finer points\\" of such movies. Maybe I'm not centered in the vortex correctly, or haven't found my power ring  yet. But then, when I watch movies such as these, I'm not looking for earth moving revealations. I'm not looking for redemption or a higher meaning. I watch for sheer, mind disconnected ENTERTAINMENT. At that, this movie excels.<br /><br />Story and acting aside, this movie is enjoyable SIMPLY to see Charlize MOVE.

B000EULJLU|5.0|It should come as no surprise that Tool's latest release is met with a fair share of criticism.  Five years to sit and contenplate a group's coming release is a long, no, a dangerous amount of time.  With new material on the way, fans and followers were literally salvating over the release of \\"10,000 Days.\\" <br />What one must understand before opening the elaborate packaging to this album is that, this is not music in a traditional sense.  Tool's sound has been a constantly evolving animal; one that can only be viewed in snapshots of time.  From the beginings of Tool to this newest release, Tool has mastered packaging a true experience into an 80 minute disc.   <br />On \\"10,000 Days,\\" dark soundscapes and the deepest of tribal grooves take the listener on a journey, much like Pink Floyd's \\"Dark Side of the Moon\\" (both figuratively and literally).  A closed mind will not even begin to understand what Tool tries to accomplish here.  Only the patient will see... <br />Once Tool's sound solidified with the release of Aenima, listeners soon realized that Tool was not a band to easily give up accessibility.  In fact, the inaccessability of Tool's music has increased with each album.  \\"10,000 Days\\" takes this to an extreme.  This album takes work on the part of the listener.  Not a little work, a LOT of work.  One must be dedicated and disciplined in order to see the forest for the trees, but, that being said, the rewards are huge.  Tool as given listeners a gift that will continue to give long after many current releases have been all but forgotten.   <br />Since the band's second major release, the image of a 'third eye' has accompanied the albums in some way, both in the artwork and in the lyrics.  In this particular case, the eye physically appears on the disc in a spriral design.  This is not just artwork.  This is a message.  A clue or key to understanding.  In order to see, you must open your eyes.  In Tool's case, you must open your third eye...your MIND.   <br />Is this album a masterpiece?  Time will tell. <br /> <br />As a greedy fan, I can't wait for the next release, but I'll wait as long as I have to.
B0007Z4S4C|5.0|At last after twelve studio albums (including two special collectors editions for fan club members only) since the break up of the world's greatest rock `n' roll band, Led Zeppelin, after the tragic death of drummer John Bonham, Robert Plant has released an album that stands up to the work of his illustrious previous band. The Mighty Rearranger is a mighty album which should be included in any record collection of people that like serious rock.<br /><br />There are many mitigating circumstances why Robert Plant has made such a successful return to the scene. Firstly, on this collection of works Robert Plant has not been afraid to admit his history, and influences. I am not for a moment suggesting that he has gone out and tried to create an album that sounds like a new Led Zeppelin album, but on the other hand he has not allowed them to stand in the way either. Quite naturally Robert Plant was the lead singer and one of the main songwriters within Led Zeppelin, so of course there are moments which are very Zepplenish, but so what? There are also many other influences on the album: Robert Plant's fanaticism with Moroccan music is heard, with a lot of use of modern technology to give each song a very up to date sheen. There is of course a lot of purely original Robert Plant in there to.<br /><br />But most importantly, although this album will be known as the new Robert Plant CD, it's actually credited to Robert Plant and The Strange Sensation, and the boys in the band have made no small contribution to the album.<br /><br />After the demise of Robert Plant's previous band `Priory Of Brion' in 2001, he wasted no time getting a new band together calling them `Strange Sensation'. Now the nucleus of the band has been together for over four years, and they are as tight as the All Blacks back row. Little idea was given of how successful a union this was going to be when they released their first album together, the quite frankly appalling `Dreamland' (2002), a collection of hurriedly put together cover versions that lacked any soul or direction.<br /><br />But after almost two hundred concerts as a band this has already been put behind them. All twelve songs on the album are originals, with thankfully not a cover version in sight. The writing, conceiving and creating of each song is credited equally amongst the band; so is the mixing, recording and producing. So for the first time since his Zeppelin days Robert Plant finds himself in more of a band situation, and if this is the result long may it continue. Not one note is wasted here. The dual guitars of Skin Tyson and Justin Adams weave in and out of each song providing the necessary textures.<br /><br />For those of you missing the old rock `n' roll thunder of the Zeppelin days you will not be disappointed by the bluster of `Tin Pan Valley' or the title track. In fact any song on this collection could have fit into the Led Zeppelin catalogue.<br /><br />Clive Deamer has the impossible job of no matter how much time has past, John Bonham left huge footprints to follow in when you are drumming for an ex-Zeppelin man, but instead of avoiding the issue this very talented skinsman meets the problem head on. If a song requires some percussion that resembles the style of the great man, then that is what the song gets. There is no use being coy about it, the job has to be done, and I'm sure the great man himself would have approved of the job done here by Clive Dreamer. Although, of course, for most of the time he just sounds like the very good musician that he is.<br /><br />John Baggott plays all the keyboards and is the man probably the most responsible for giving this album it's cohesion, setting up a wall of intricate keyboards and allowing the guitars and Robert Plant's vocals to sparkle over the top.<br /><br />The find of the album, though, is the bass playing abilities of a certain Billy Fuller, who is such a unique bass player that I would go as far as to say he has created a completely new way of playing the four string. His work can be heard all the way through the album, but is at it's most prominent best during second song, and first single off the album, `Shine It All Around' where he achieves a bass sound that can only be described as filthy. He is even allowed enough space for a short solo.<br /><br />Unfortunately, due to all musicians having such tight schedules these days, well the good ones anyway, since the recording of this album there have been two changes to the Strange Sensations line up: Billy Fuller moving on up the rock `n' roll family tree to be replaced by Robert Plant's old cohort Charlie Jones, and Skin Tyson being replaced by Porl Thompson, who had played with Page and Plant on their reunion tour. It's a pretty fair swap in both cases I feel.<br /><br />This must not of course take the focus of attention away from the main man himself, Mr Robert Plant, aka Percy to his friends (a reference to his affection for gardening and Percy Thrower, the man behind the gardening programmes on the British Broadcasting Television network. Led Zeppelin's gardening exploits whilst on the road are nearly as well documented as their music). Robert Plant is now in his sixth decade, and although he can still belt out a rocker with the best of them, he uses the new maturity in his voice, that only comes with the accumulation of years, to full effect. He's not kidding when on `Shine It All Around' he sings \\"These are the best days of my life/Bright, strong and golden', or perhaps more tellingly on `Tin Pan Valley,' showing his new re-found confidence and comfort with the past. \\"I come from Tin Pan Valley, and I'm moving right along/I live in a former glory, so long ago and gone/I'm turning down the talk shows, the humour and the couch /I'm moving onto higher ground, I've found a new way out.\\"<br /><br />Mighty Rearranger brings out all the best nuances of the Plant vocal chords using all his middle eastern phrasing, other worldly voices, soft blues accents, gorgeous psychedelic swooshes, and the customized heavy rock roar, plus, as an extra bonus, there is some devilish harmonica playing during the title track.<br /><br />`Brother Ray' was a late addition to the album, giving us a genuine heartfelt tribute to the great Ray Charles, starting out with some great barrelhouse piano before leading into the main body of the song. So don't click your CD off as there is a ten second gap between sections, where the band get into something much more modern.<br /><br />The Mighty Rearranger does not miss a trick. Not only does it have great impact upon first listening, but it also grows on you more and more after each new listening. If you have been put off the solo work from Led Zeppelin's old singer with his previous dabbling with such diverse musical styles as doo-wop, synth pop, and even bass and drums, give `Mighty Rearranger' a try. If you enjoy class you will enjoy this.<br /><br />Mott the Dog.g.

B000002KHH|4.0|Great classic metal/hard rock album,  and somehow Sabbath has convinced everyone they invented metal.    They didn't.   I was 17 years old when this album came out  (I'm 52 now) and remember buying this album and loving it.   But I was already listening to Blue Cheer (the band that REALLY started metal),  Hendrix, Steppenwolf, Led Zeppelin, Mountain, Deep Purple, Ten Years After, Foghat, Jeff Beck Group, Crazy World of Arthur Brown (he started satanic music, not Sabbath), and Humble Pie (nobody was heavier than them!)   So don't tell me Sabbath invented metal!!  There were a lot of heavy AND satanic music around then -- don't believe everything you read.   Plus, Iron Maiden just ripped off Uriah Heep who did it 10 years earlier.  I got that off my chest -- but I still love \\"Paranoid\\" and early Sabbath -- classic metal.
B00006FDCD|2.0|We were all VERY interested, as 20-somethings, that IT was being adapted for film, albeit for television, and to our further chagrin, on the ABC Network; they're notorious for \\"adapting\\" our favorite works by a salesman's idea of the \\"acceptable.\\" <br />   This will be remade. Peter Jackson is the Man. PETER, WE NEED YOU TO FOCUS ON THIS ONE PROJECT FOR NOW, COULD YOU? I know KONG made billions, so you're, um, free? GOOD.  <br /> <br />   GET INTO THIS NOVEL, PETER.

B000EULJLU|5.0|With every album, Tool continues it's metamorphasis from compelling prog-metal band, to a band that really matters. 10,000 Days goes beyond the average song format most bands conform to. It is an album full of pieces that flow together. With the exception of maybe, Vicarious, most of these songs are not meant to fit the regular radio format (although it would be extremely refreshing to hear the local stations push the envelope and play some music that does the same. <br /> <br />Vicarious: Excellent song. I could picture this song being on Aenima or Lateralus... definitely the perfect song to bridge their previous material to the new. <br /> <br />Jambi: Another great song. It has that classic sound you can only describe as \\"Tool\\". Cool wah-wah solo. <br /> <br />Wings for Marie: Haunting... Reminds me a lot of Pink Floyd, but again, it retains that \\"Tool\\" sound. <br /> <br />10,000 Days (Wings for Marie Part 2): Ah, the Pink Floyd influence is strong... but pleasantly so, as this song is obviously vintage Tool. <br /> <br />The Pot: This song could have been a B-Side for Aenima... or maybe even Undertow. It's aggressive, heavy, defiant. <br /> <br />Lipjan Conjuring: I'm not sure who Lipjan is, but this is some creepy filler. I would not recommend waking up to this track in an old, dark house that makes odd, inexplainable sounds... like I did. <br /> <br />Lost Keys (Blame Hoffman): A couple of eerie,detuned, sustaining notes on a guitar open this track, giving way to a pleasant riff accompanied by strange voices. <br /> <br />Rosetta Stoned: Another track whose aggresiveness and defiant tones would have fit in pretty well on Aenima... Kind of reminiscent of Third Eye. <br /> <br />Intension: More tabla... one of those cinematic type songs that starts out slow and beautiful, builds into some sampled, frenetic electonic ambience, and ends as slowly as it was born. <br /> <br />Right in Two: Great song. More table, lots of changes in tempo and intensity. Gets fast and furious towards the end (with some of Danny Careys most awe inspiring fills ever... an eclectic ending, and a peaceful fade. <br /> <br />Viginti Trees: The only real letdown for me. Sounds like a bunch of static... Ever see the film, White Noise? Yeah. But this is pretty much a Tool trademark now, closing albums with something we have to guess pretty hard to figure out what it is. <br /> <br />BOTTOM LINE: This album is not Aenima! It is not Undertow! It is not Laturalus! It is simply the next step in Tool's evolution into a band that creates music that is more than just music. 10,000 Days is a masterpiece, a symphony, and just a kick-ass musical journey. Lets just hope 10,000 days is not how long we have to wait for the follow up. 3 or 4 years to develope their art seems to be a good formula. <br /> <br />
B00005AQF7|5.0|I remember this CD very fondly. In fact it was one of my very first CD's I ever owned. I was approcahing 6th grade back when this came out in 1993. Like a vintage wine, this CD has aged really well and helped define the genre of rap, back when it was real instead of all this sellout crap that's being produced today. No mindless disses (well, certainly not on Eminem's level) no pop samples, just straight up rap from Cali yo.  <br /> <br />Before creating his \\"fo shizzle\\" catchphrase...Snoop was laying down them rhymes and letting everyone know who he was on \\"Who Am I (What's My Name)?\\" to describing the \\"Gz and Hustlas\\". This is a straight up party record as well, play this and any youth in their 20's today will remember it fondly (well those who like hip hop anyway). <br /> <br />Give it a listen fo shizzle ma nizzle. You won't regret-izle! :D

B000301YY8|2.0|I don't quite see the appeal of the trend for explicit language in music. I think it would be much better to just leave it out. Whether you sing it or speak it its just plain offensive.
B00005JOYA|5.0|Yes, the visuals were amazingly close to the game and were awesome.  I think the plot was very interesting and kept me intersted all the way through.  The end leaves it open for interpretation, and I hope there is a sequel!!  Watch out for the siren.  Not a very scary movie, but more of a psychological thriller.  Finally a video game to movie done right.
B000EJ9MTW|4.0|I've been excited about the Wolfmother U.S. debut for months now.  When I first popped it in, one of my best friends (and a helluva guitar player) immediately started complaining about how \\"derivitive\\" this band's sound is.  And it's totally true.  My friend loves Interpol, and it's no surprise that the knock on that band is that they are \\"derivitive\\" of bands like Joy Division particularly.  Wolfmother IS derivitive, sometimes painfully so.  But it's derivitive of some of the greatest bands that ever existed.  There's nothing groundbreaking about this release.  The vocalist sounds like an intersting mix of Robert Plant, Ozzy, and Jack White.  The music sounds like a combination of the aforementioned singers' bands - Zeppelin, Sabbath, and the White Stripes (and maybe some Beatles and Deep Purple thrown in).  But if you're into heavy music you can't go wrong mixing the obvious lyrical and musical tributes to rock's founding fathers with the garage rock urgency and wild abandon of the White Stripes.  There are some awesome songs on this disc, notably Dimension, Woman, Pyramid, and Witchcraft.  There are some songs that are just such obvious rip offs that it's impossible to ignore.  White Unicorn is so obviously a Zoso-era Zeppelin copy that it's painful; same goes for the much talked about \\"Apple Tree\\" which is so complete a White Stripes rip off that it even seems to have a lower sound quality than the rest of the album, perhaps to make it sound more like the Stripes early garage rock on Jack's 8 track.  All this having been said, if you enjoy heavy music and want to help usher in a new era of heavy bands in the mainstream, you need to support groups like Wolfmother and The Sword, who are leading this new generation of hard rockers.  Wolfmother, with their videos already all over MTV2 and with the backing of a major label, will be the leaders of this movement, for better or worse.  They are an overhyped band, but this CD has great riffs and some excellent songwriting in places, and because of that it's worth checking out.
B000FFJYCU|5.0|I have high hopes for the quality of this new release, and greatly look forward to seeing Grand Prix again. It was a reserved-seat movie back in 1966, and in those days epic movies took their spectacle seriously. (Grand Prix is spectacular in a different way than Spartacus, which in turn is different from Lawrence, etc.)    Back in 1966, or '56 or '46, when actors drove cars in movies, even race cars, they were invariably back-projected. Seemed fakey then, though now it doesn't bother me. But Grand Prix was maybe the first movie to eschew back projection for actor-driving-car scenes. In GP, the 70mm camera that pans and tilts, is literally bolted on the cars. The scenery flying by is real. The actual actor, e.g., Garner or Ives Montand, is out in the weather driving his race car and driving pretty fast, and you're out there with him, two feet away. What a movie.
B000EULJLU|5.0|Being a long time tool fan, I picked this album up right when it hit the shelf and while i was listining to it for the first time I read reviews about it. I read many coverering many stances, and I started to veiw the album by their standards. Then, I took a step back and listened to it while doing nothing else.<br /><br />One thing tool albums do for me, is that when I listen to it for the first time, I pick tracks that are good, and tracks that are bad, but after a while of listening to the album, the tracks start to grow on me and every song has it's place. The same was so with this album. 'Vicariouse', 'Jambi', 'The Pot', 'Rosetta Stoned', and 'Right in Two' were the ones that stuck out the first listen. Breathtaking in their own manner, and, in the case of 'Rosetta Stoned' haunting and disturbing.<br /><br />Many people had problems with the album's lyrics, and I have to admit, I did too. Why would I want to listen about Maynord \\"S***ing the bed\\" in 'Rosseta Stoned' or \\"Monkeys\\" in 'Right in Two?' If you look a little deeper, though, the songs are about being in a mental institution and the contrasting sides of creation vs. evolution respectivly.<br /><br />The songs on this album are deeper than people initialy gave them credit for to begin with, and are nothing short of what I expect from tool. Tackling contraversial subjects in a hard-to-digest capsul of amazing drum work and phonominal guitar riffs.
B000EULJLU|4.0|I remember seeing a couple of Frank Zappa shows back in the late 70s where Frank would stand in the middle of the stage, his back to the audience, and guide the musicians along with an orchestra conductor's wand because the music was so intricate. It sure wouldn't surprise me to see Maynard James Keenan (vocals) doing the same thing at the Tool live shows.<br /><br />10,000 Days is another disk of Tool's signature, complex rhythms and melodies with Maynard at the helm laying down vocals that range from the spoken word to mimicry to clear, precisely sung rockers.<br /><br />Tool stick to their customary three styles of tunes that can pretty much be summed up as 1) hard progressive rockers, 2) dark progressive Pink Floydesque arrangements (\\"Dark Side of the Tool\\"), and 3) just plain wacky.<br /><br />No matter which style they ultimately choose, you would be hard pressed to be able to whistle or hum a song all the way through without the help of your iPod. Some serious musicianship has gone into all of Tool's CDs (with the exception of course for the tracks that they clearly, deliberately are screwing around on). On 10,000 Days they do not deviate from the originality that have made them a top draw in the US and overseas.<br /><br />The originality is sustainable too. It is a welcome relief from the atrocious homogenization of pop and rock radio. Tool's originally is now expected from them. Signature. But it has not lost the originality edge. 10,000 Days is evidence of that.<br /><br />As for the songs on 10,000 Days:<br /><br />1) Hard Progressive Rockers - tracks 1, 2 & 5<br />2) Dark Progressive Pink Floydesque Arrangements (Dark Side of the Tool) - tracks 3, 4, 7, 8, 9 & 10<br />3) Just Plain Wacky - 6 & 11<br /><br />Danny Carey as always is as perfect as Neil Peart of Rush on drums. Maynard James Keenan could end up with his own separate plaque in the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame (whether he'd accept it is another thing). Adam Jones (guitar) has developed a signature sound with Tool where any attempt at imitation will be immediately called out. And Justin Chancellor has been an absolute gift to the band since around 1995.<br /><br />If you're into rock there are refreshing treats for you here. If you liked Dark Side of the Moon there are refreshing treats for you here. Don't pass on 10,000 Days.iately called out.

B000ETQRCM|5.0|EVER, PJ have taken us through the near \\"Punk-glam-grunge\\" of post-eighties, depressive angst with \\"Ten\\", explored polyrhythms and funk after touring with the Chili Peppers and changing drummers on \\"Vs.\\", then \\"found their roots\\" with the organic tastes of \\"Vitalogy\\", the first hearkenings to the sounds they would become known for. While underrated, \\"No Code\\" and \\"Yield\\" were GREAT albums, but we (and PJ themselves) were still trying to figure out who PEARL JAM was, so there was some lack of cohesion and possibly alienation of the fan base...BUT their live shows held everyone together. It was not until the mediocre sounds of \\"Binaural\\" and \\"Riot Act\\" did I truly begin to question whether or not this band was going to even be around much longer---or whether anyone was going to care if they weren't.<br /><br />But, songs like \\"Man of the Hour\\", while pensive and certainly not \\"rocking\\", along with the fire of their live shows showed that the light was still on...however, the four years of relative silence has been deafening...<br /><br />Now the band brings us the eponymous \\"Pearl Jam\\", which is as good, if not better, than any albums that came before it. I have listened from start to finish several times through and it just keeps getting better. I don't think I've ever heard the band's live sound captured so well on one of their studio recordings. Stone and Mike are playing better than ever (and Ed is playing some guitar on there as usual), and Jeff and Matt are just infernal as the rhythm section for the machine. In this man's opinion, Jeff Ament is the reason why this band has sounded so fresh from the moment they came out of Andy Wood's death with this new band...Jeff's bass lines are so original, so cool, yet so understated, and he uses so many different intruments: a fretless standup here, an 8 string bass there, a 12-string bass (on earlier records, notably \\"Jeremy\\"), a 4-string electric, a 4-string bowed electric, a 5-string bass. He keeps the songs sounding new yet familiar...<br /><br />But I digress, \\"Pearl Jam\\" is a tour de force of organic energy. I cannot stop listening to it. The realization of a \\"life wasted\\" is a scary thought for these forty somethings, and a lot of my generation feels the same way along with them, which adds to the poignancy of the first songs lyrics. \\"World Wide Suicide\\" is the single, but doesn't quite reach the heights for which it was originally intended, at least in my opinion. The trio of \\"Comatose\\", \\"Severed Hand\\", and \\"Marker in the Sand\\" are just phenomenal. I dare you to listen to the chorus of the latter song and to not sing along...this attack against hypocrisy and high-handedness hits hard. Are you listening, Republicans?<br /><br />Then there is \\"Parachutes\\", a lovely guitar based ballad by Stone that took me a while to \\"get\\". The way Ed initally phrases the verses took some getting used to, but when the song turns the mode to the Dorian towards the end just lifts this song to something ethereal, and the message is just so strong...<br /><br />One of my favorites, \\"Unemployable\\", is a blue-collar story with hook after hook, from the guitar riff at the beginning to the \\"Uh-oh-oh's\\" of the chorus, if it weren't such a sad and home-hitting topic this would be an anthem for a generation...it may still be. Who of us aren't \\"scared alive...near to death\\" at some point in our lives?<br /><br />Then there's the final few longs which are fairly laid back, but poignant topical pieces, with \\"Army Reserve\\" and \\"Inside Job\\" standing tall, with the last song being just an amazingly personal look into Mr. Vedder's soul...<br /><br />And the record fits together quite well, each song has it's own space but still feels part of a bigger whole. This record is what rock and roll is about, showing us that judgments based on age, and time, and what came before mean nothing. Listen, and listen again...and when Pearl Jam comes near you on tour this summer, go see what will be an AMAZING live show from what is probably the most important band in American history. Folks, Pearl Jam is America's Led Zeppelin...ory. Folks, Pearl Jam is America's Led Zeppelin...
B000EMGAGW|1.0|After such a reputation in the Rap Game,  Mobb is Riding Da DDDD...of all people 50.  I never.  I haven't heard the CD all I see is 50 and his camp all over the joint and I know I would rather not hear.  After all of the work they have put in over past 10 years and all of the tight MC's that exist they have camp-out with G=Unit. I guess that one hot track f/50 from the Free Agents was enough to give them trust in his reputation.  Well they are 1 on billboard so I guess it worked.  I guess after Common road on Kanye's  dddddddd which didn't actually work in his favor.  And I don't care if you agree, it is what it is and I know it is garbage without even listening that is how SMART I AM!  It is averaging 3 stars and for rap artist with such credibility that equals GARBAGE. HA HA! The OJAY'S ONCE MADE A SONG CALLED FOR THE LOVE OF M O N E Y!  What a Waste!
B000EULJLU|5.0|Tool being my favorite band (along with The Tea Party) does not disappoint in the least!  This album has my utmost support.  A lot has already been said about this album (and a lot will yet be said I am sure), so I am going to keep this short.  This is not Lateralus part 2.  Lateralus should have warned everyone that they were headed in a more atmospheric direction, so this should have been expected on 10,000 Days (at least I know I expected it, but I enjoy psychedelic soundscapes heartily).  The intense songs are top-notch Tool too.  Maynard does some things with his voice he's never done before.  This album is a step forward, not backward. <br /> <br />NOTE: <br />With the stereoscopic lenses: for those of you who don't know, the lenses make the artwork three-dimensional.  You have to cross your eyes while you are looking through them until both of the identical pictures merge.  It is by far the most creative and enjoyable album packaging I have EVER seen.  I agree with the other reviewer that the packaging alone is nearly worth the price.
B000EULJLU|1.0|I know everyone on here really likes to say they are renaissance men of rock, they understand what a band is doing and the music is timeless.... I think sometimes we get caught up as fans, and think things through too much, and fool ourselves. I am sure none of you were anticipating this album with hopes that there would be all of these non-rock tracks on there. I am sure if every track rocked you guys, you wouldn't be saying I demand my money back, this is an outcry, no noise?? <br />I am willing to bet all of your favorite songs ROCK. Rock I said, not long drawn out tracks filled with meditation sounds. Can I trade in the specs for some aroma therapy? <br />This band is so talented; they have one of the greatest percussionist ever, incredible song writing, and a sound all their own that really moves you.  Couldn't they have pressed a double album with just one concept track filled with these noises? Think about it  50-60 minutes of non stop noises, oh the journey we could have all been on getting used to those sounds. I would have been happy to split the album any of you who wanted all the new progressive noise. I'm not buying all this, it's brilliant let's get used to it give it time. Bring back the complex primal rock and roll!!! <br />
B000EULJLU|5.0|The thing I love about Tool is how the music can sorta take you beyond time and space. Maybe its the polyrythms and strange effects, maybe i've eaten too many mushrooms for one lifetime, but this album has a way of drawing you into a more subtle state. <br />I like it more than Lateralus because this one is more dynamic, feeling and otherworldly. <br />The polyrhythmic aspect is more pronounced and sophisticated on this album than any so far. There is also a kind of bluesy quality to this one that hasn't really been present in prior albums. <br />You can really see why Maynard claims Joni Mitchell as a major vocal influence when you listen to 10,000 Days. His vocals have a few more vulnerable and honest moments than in past albums. <br />If I was still that small minded metalhead kid who thought anything that strayed from its appropriate genre was lame, I would hate this album. <br />However thanks to continuous expansion of consciousness since then, i can say that with this album, tool takes the listener into another unforseen genre shattering universe. What other band does that?
B000EULJLU|5.0|Finally, after 5 years we once again rejoice in the musical tapestry woven by Tool. As with Lateralus, the songs may not hit you with full effect until the third or fourth listen. The Pot does not disappoint those craving the tool of old, while the Wings For Marie duo carry the band to a place not far removed from Lateralus. Also, does anyone else notice the similarity between the mid fillings of Right In Two and those of Forty Six and Two from AEnima? Thank God, five years is a long time!
B000002G0Q|5.0|Until I saw all the positive reviews here, I thought I was like Antonio Salieri in Amadeus...\\"worshiping the sound that I alone, seemed to here\\".  I bought this cd when it came out in '92 and have yet to grow tired of hearing it.  I can say the same only of works by Zeppelin, the Beatles, and Queen and that's it!
B000EU1KRS|5.0|The reveiwer before said it all! Sometimes you throw sht in the blender and what comes out is strangly pallatable and other times it comes out like this -- gourme'.
B000EULJLU|2.0|What I dont understand is why we keep buying this 3 to 4 song cd and the rest is sh** Nothing but noises to fill the CD!!  <br />And also you cant even hear the vocals. Dont get me wrong tool is a very creative band but come on!!!!
B00005R1N3|4.0|Most people look to Halloween when looking for a landmark film that started the slasher subgenre of horror.  I did for quite a while, and, don't get me wrong, Halloween is a classic of massive proportions.  However, Black Christmas is somehow constantly overlooked.  Even I, a devoted horror fan, had somehow never seen this movie, even though I claim to be an expert on all things horror cinema.<br /><br />After finally watching this film, I am not disappointed at all, and it frustrates me even more that it can be so ignored by most horror fans.  The plot of Black Christmas is really simple: a group of sorority sisters are getting ready to all head home for Christmas break, and on the last night together on campus, they start to receive weird, disturbing, perverted phone calls.  Soon after the film starts, we are introduced to the killer through a first-person view as he climbs into the attic.  The film starts out fairly slow and unfocused.  We are introduced to a few characters who seem as if they are going to be important but never really pan out.  Once the film \\"slims down\\" its cast, it gains much more tension and ability to actually scare the viewer.  Jess, the main character, is actually a pretty good actress, and, while she does buy into some stupid horror cliches, she is a very believable and sympathetic character that we have to root for.<br /><br />The film obviously wasn't trying to win any awards for screenplay or acting, but the film succeeds on almost every level that a horror movie strives for.  It achieves a large amount of tension, a good number of genuine scares, and it makes the viewer grit their teeth even though it avoids most gore throughout the entire film.  While the film may feel a little choppy, and it seems like  it doesn't make very good use out of its limited run time, you have to give it major credit for being the first movie to jump into this genre and do it without fear.  Any horror fan will greatly appreciate this film.
B000EULJLU|5.0|10,000 days is the type of album that grows on you after you give it some time. When I first downloaded the album I thought that 10,000 days didn't quite live up to the tool name, or the bar that was set by Aenima and Lateralus. But this is great music whether some of you would like to admit it or not. I downloaded the album the day it leaked and after constantly listening to it, -all the way up to 3 days before the release- I began to comprehend the sound that was flowing into my ears. And its only sounded better since then. 10,000 days is the most progressive release that the band has ever done, So don't come into 10,000 days expecting an onslaught of singles. You'll need to listen to the album from start to finish without skiping a track here and there.(with the exeption of some of the interleudes, if you should choose)<br /><br />Some of you seem to be frustrated that the album isn't angry enough for you...Well what did you expect? In case you haven't heard this whole album is based about maynard and his deceased mother and how she affectes his life to this day. So I don't know how you would come into this album expecting angst.<br /><br />But that being said, I have a feeling tool may just shake off more then a few fans with this release, becuase I get the feeling that some fans want a Aenima Pt II or Lateralus part II. Or might think that this is an album of \\"Filler\\" tracks.(For the record, Wings part 1 and intension are NOT filler)<br /><br />I can't really say where 10,000 days ranks up compared to their back-catalogue in my mind yet, because I feel that I still haven't given it the proper amount of time to sit in my head. Tool still seem to be able to deliver great song after great song, and the only break in the consistancy comes in when Lipan Conjuring and Lost keyes come in. I don't think that it was a great idea to put two interludes right next two each other. But other then that I have nothing but good things to say about 10,000 days.<br /><br />And please If you downloaded the album when it leaked, go out and pick up the real thing if you haven't yet. The great artwork alone is a good enough reason to buy the album.m when it leaked, go out and pick up the real thing if you haven't yet. The great artwork alone is a good enough reason to buy the album.
B000EMGAGW|4.0|This is without a doubt, one of the hardest LPs out right now.  I am not a big fan of G-Unit but I have followed Mobb Deep's Carrer,  anybody not getting this cd just cuz they signed to g-unit is a damn fool.  Almost every track on this cd is a banger.  Thier was a few tracks that should not have been on their but overall it was excellent. I was also A little disappointed that the features on this cd were all g-unit, no noyd or cormega.  Thats why this cd only get 4.5 stars. Mobb for life!
B000002WYT|3.0|I've heard from Dave die-hards like my best friend that many hardcore fans don't like this album because they feel Dave somewhat \\"sold out\\"... but in my mind, they're missing the critical point... if you sell out and the material actually sounds BETTER (especially with regard to the general mainstream!!!!), then one has justification.... <br /> <br />Case in point with Crash... Dave usually kicks his albums off well (As he did with Under The Table and Dreaming)... and this time, 'Too Much' really does satisfy as a follow up to the title track... I just feel that there is better sequencing in this album compared to Under The Table... the jazz infused semi-funk of 'Too Much' is really really impressive... I like it.... and then there are songs like 'Tripping Billies' that have great energy and a great bluegrass feel... so for not being a \\"Davehead\\", I think this is the best album for a beginning fan..
B000EHRVP6|1.0|Horrible movie,very poor acting & weak script very predictable.I got this movie thinkin well if Quentin Tarantino had anything to do with it this should be good.But I was way wrong this is one of those movie where you see the trailer you think wow this will be awsome.But basiclly all your seein is the best parts of the movie.Don't waste the time or money it's 94 min you'll never get back & you'll feel alot smarter for not watching.
B0000AQS0F|4.0|First let me state that I am a fan of the works of Whedon, this one included. Contrasted to Buffy and Angel, it comes from a concept seldom tried, that of mixed genres.  <br />The series, unlike Buffy ans Anngel which, not quite as gruesome as the various CSI shows, is a series that will not give children the heebie-jeebies. All the gruesome stuff is left to the imagination, even encounters with the Reivers, who practice, torture, murder, and sustenance cannibalism, as compared to ritual cannibalism, found in many cultures. Residrnts of New Guinea in the twentieth cnetury, and Fiji in the nineteenth, were notorious for practicing sustenace cannibalism. Here, the Reivers are never shown, letting your imagination run wild. Boo! <br />Due to the explcitly sexual activities of the principal character of paid companion played by Morena Baccarat, the series should be at least PG. There is no soap opera type grappling, or NYPD Blue type nudity. At least, if there had been it was certainly unmemorable; so though the action is never shown, this is PG. Reminds me of Laurette Spang's role of Cassiopia in the pilot of the original Battlestar Glactica. In the first (third aired) episode her role was changed to that of a fully clothed nurse so the series could run in family time at eight pm.  <br />Compare this with the plenitude of half-dresed space hookers featured in the Buck Rogers series, starring Pamela Hwnsley as the wicked Priness Ardala, and Erin Gray in her skin tight silver cat suit as Col. Deering. And the plenitude of others including party girls, the most memorable of whom was Pamela Susan Shoop wearing a sideless, backless dress made of what appeared to be horizontal sections of window blinds. <br />So in this series, most of the women dress in mechnic's clothes, pionner days long dresses and getups reminiscent of Stewart Granger in King Solomon's Mines or all the jungle set advenures and SW Pacific-set pot-boilers of the thirties and forties. Breeches and high lace boos et al.  Every else wears clothing of American cowboy movies, except for the Alliance soldiers and the upper-class exploiters. So although both men and women are equally clothed, the absurdity of dress comes from the anachronistic appearance.  <br />The next most absurd thing is that though there of plenty of whar appear to be snti-gravity shuttle craft and larger space ships, there is no mechanized ground transport, except for very small ATVs and standard railways. But where are the coal-burners? Everyone rides horses to get aroundt as well go all the way. ;0) Number two! <br />And, since it is cheap to film in the desrt, all the worlds are arid. No ice planets or heavy forests and jungles as in Star Wars. So absurdiy number three is all planets are arid! <br />Next is the personal weaons carried by the cast. In Star Treks they all carry phasers or some sort of disintrator like the Klingons do. Though the Discovery Channel seres Mythbusters disproved that a single hole in an air liner fuselage will not vause explosive decompreesion, it seems that Star Trek has the right idea that impackt weapons are not desirable when fighting insode a space ship. Babylon Five made this point explicitly that firearms are no longer used. Yet not only are firearms carried, they appear to be vap and ball revolbers like those used in the Amercan Civil War, Where are the tommy guns, or the modern HK MP5, M16s, or any kind of crew served weapons for close in ship defense. I only saw Jayne use an automatic weapon once. And no one appears with a semi-automatic pistol or a MAC10 so popular with drug smugglers on TV. Another absurdity. <br />I enjoyed this series, have bought the film on DVD, and recommend it highly. Though I recognize the reality of the clothing I did enjoy looking at the space babes on my VHS tapes of Buck Rogers. <br />The characters are all interesting, some are even sympathetic, most are a bundle of contradictiond as are real folk. No captain Picard here! It is just I think that a series, no matter when it is set, should be of one time and setting and be internally consistentnot mixed up as this one is.
B0000E6XH3|4.0|That's my title, because you really have to watch it twice to really appreciate the work that was put into this.<br /><br />The music is amazing, of course, and very repetitive. Also, there's no dialogue. You need to be prepared for that, otherwise friends you want to enjoy this will be upset.<br /><br />Visuals are fun and funky. They even toss in a CG scene or two to emphasize the city stature. You should take a look at the \\"Making Of\\" extra in the extra features menu.<br /><br />The story is neat and presented sufficiently in the way everything is sequenced on the screen. There are no real plot holes, and some of the concepts are so bizarre and retro. In one particular scene, I commented, \\"This is where it goes all Scooby Doo.\\" You'll see many retro animation and 70's pop culture references in this movie.<br /><br />If I could change one thing, I would maybe change the transitions between songs, but other than that, it's all groovy.
B00005JOIH|5.0|Politics, especially when its players are so close to home, is a finely drawn tightrope for a filmmaker to cross, but Spielberg has done it with aplomb, originality and respect to all concerned. A complex view of a political situation where no one wins. Israelis and Palestinians are human beings caught up in an impossible and brutal reality. No one is above politics. No one is a beast of pure evil--just fallible, desperate human beings caught up in impossible political realities of which they must take less-than-perfect sides and make less than perfect decisions that affect others. I cringed and cowered at the beginning with Munich scenes. I cringed at the Paris scenes later. I cried inside for the bloodshed being wrought by kin against kin who are being manipulated to fight against each other by the powers that be. Acting and editing at least should have won awards rather than panned by the Oscar committee. Never mind, Spielberg has done one of his finest works and will recieve a deserved lifetime achievement witin thirty years.
B00003CXV4|2.0|The only good thing about this movie is the guy that plays Luscious Malfoy in the Harry Potter movies, and the guy that plays Lex Luthor on \\"Smallville\\" play a gay couple.  They're freakin' hilarious, but otherwise this is terrible.  Keanu Reeves trying to be sensitive and romantic is every bit as frightening as you might imagine.  He should go back to being Ted Theodore Logan.
B00005JKQ6|3.0|This is one of the more strang movies Ive seen over the years. Then again, portraits of delusional, mentally-ill people tend to be a little different. This, however, is VERY different and is a success because Burt Lancaster plays the the title role so well. <br /> <br />Lancaster's character, \\"Neddy,\\" is a man  who decides to \\"swim\\" home, doing laps in neighbors'pools for several miles until he reaches \\"home.\\" That's the plot. <br /> <br />However, the real story is uncovering who and what he is really was in the past. It's also an expose of Yuppie suburban snobbery, something that will never go out of style but is 1960s-ish in this film. It's interesting to see a bunch of familiar actors faces pop up as the various neighbors as Lancaster swims from pool to pool. <br /> <br />To focus on the shallow neighbors - and they are shallow, vain and pretty revolting - is to miss how \\"Neddy\\" is worse than them. Slowly but surely, he is exposed as an adulterer, crook, completely selfish, poor father, etc. etc. <br /> <br />In the end, we see just how delusional he is, too, completely unable or unwilling to see reality, still living in his dreamworld. Apparently, two years before the scenes in here take place, he booted out of his house by his also-unlikable wife and lost everything...his family, job, you name it. <br /> <br />Much of this film is dream-like, nicely photographed with some pretty nature shots, particularly the first half which features a young actress, Janet Landgard, who was \\"introduced\\" in this film but never did much after this film.  She plays Burt's former babysitter and he meets up with her early on and then tries to hit on the pretty 20-year- old, finally scaring her away. <br /> <br />Landgard has the second-biggest role in the film. The third belongs to Janice Rule, who appears near the end for a long pool-side soap opera scene, the last encounter Burt has until he reaches his destination.  <br /> <br />Overall, it's an unpleasant, haunting tale of shallow people but it's well-done and sure to evoke a number of discussions and interpretations. It's also interesting to view this movie twice, seeing it a second time when you know exactly Lancaster's situation and mental state. This came from a very short story by John Cheever (10-15 pages, depending on the size of the book) so much of the movie and almost all of the dialog, is made up. This is certainly a film you remember.  <br />
B00005JO20|4.0|This is a pretty cool movie, great special effects, and Jack Black and Adrien Brody are both awesome in it, but does it really need to be 3 hours long?  I mean, they spend like 45 minutes on the boat ride to the island.  I'm surprised there's not a scene of Adrien quietly reading a book for 10 minutes.  Once they get on the island, it's nonstop, but it takes too damn long to get there.  I guess that's the \\"Peter Jackson Curse\\".  Peter, your movies rock, but learn how to make something under 3 hours, please. <br /> <br />Oh, and I cried like a little girl when the monkey died.  I can admit it.
B000AGTPUK|5.0|I found myself saying \\"wow\\" over and over as I watched this movie on DVD went it came out just before Thanksgiving of 2005. Since then, I've seen it a half-dozen times and it continually amazes   Each time I think I'm watching the most beautiful or amazing artwork I've ever seen drawn for a movie. The visuals are just stunning, scene after scene.     The sound ain't bad, either! Those not playing this on a surround system are missing an integral part of this movie and a lot of fun. The roar of train as it comes and goes, for one example, is awesome.    It isn't just the great visuals and audio; the story is extremely entertaining all the way with some very adventurous scenes. There are a couple of roller coaster-type scenes which were especially fun, and actually thrilling.     Normally, 100 minutes is a bit long for me to sit through an animated film but this was filled with so many amazing sights and fun action scenes that time was no problem. Along the way are some touching messages about sharing life with other humans, and about giving.
B000E1YW0E|5.0|I'm normally not a big fan of musicals, but this movie is just freakin amazing.  Great music, great cast, touching story, it's just perfect.  Adam Pascal (who you might remember from \\"School of Rock\\") is an awesome singer, with killer range.  Rosario Dawson did a great job too.  I had no idea she could sing like that. <br /> <br />Anyway, this is really good stuff.  Like I said, the best musical ever.
B000059XUI|5.0|This is the best of the Superman movies because of the three villains, played by Terrence Stamp, Sarah Douglas and Jack O'Halloran. <br /> <br />Those three are so good, particularly Stamp, that they make this easily the most memorable of the four films. The scenes with them on the moon, their first encounter on earth and their climactic fight against Superman in the skies above Metropolis are all outstanding. <br /> <br />Once again, Superman goes a little overboard in his romance to Lois Lane (do you believe some reviewers are upset there weren't explicit sex scenes in the film?) Hey, folks, it's just a comic book and it's supposed to be innocent, clean fun. Sorry that turns you off. For the rest of us, this is generally very enjoyable film from start to finish, with no real lulls.  <br />
B00005JNJV|5.0|This is the best Batman movie they've made so far.  Christian Bale does an awesome job, and Liam Neeson and Cillian Murphy are great as the villians.  Katie Holmes isn't that great, but at least she's nice to look at.  Also, it's cool that they actually did something good with the Scarecrow character.  I was worried it was gonna be like in \\"Batman & Robin\\", with the horribly done Bane with the super-crappy foam suit, and the guy making \\"Rerrr!\\" sounds.  But they actually pulled Scarecrow off really well, and Murphy's natural creepiness fits perfectly. <br /> <br />Definitely buy this, if you're a Batman fan.  It's surprisingly very good.
B000ETQRCM|1.0|I am a big Pearl Jam fan and this album is musically and lyrically not very good at all.  Don't believe all of these reviews.  I was shocked when I listened to the CD the first time.  The quality of the CD is very poor. On the first 4 songs it feels like they are rushing to play the music which is repetitive and unappealing to the ears.  Then the CD mellows out a little bit.  I really like a lot of thier softer music(loved Live at Benaroya Hall) but these songs don't do anything for me.  A couple of more bland rock songs are follwed by the best part of the CD.  The last 3 songs sound like a gift after listening to the first 10.  Overall very disappointing.  Can't wait for the Chili Peppers.  I heard their double CD on VH1.com and it sounds great.
6305882592|5.0|When I grow up, I want to be just like Maude. <br /> <br />This movie dispelled my fear of growing old, and turned me on  to Cat Steven's super great music and lyrics.  <br /> <br />This is a black comedy , a cult classic. I used to gauge my future romances by whether my date liked (and got) what this film was all about.  <br /> <br />This is my favorite movie of all time. At first I liked it, but each time I saw it , I enjoyed it more , until I fell in love with it.  <br /> <br />It is offbeat and quirky, with snatches of dry humor and profound truth.... so if you are looking for a comfortable neat and tidy movie, look elsewhere, as this will irritate you and you won't know why. <br /> <br /> For , as Jack Kerouac said so eloquently: <br />      \\"The only people for me are the mad ones, the ones who are mad to live, mad to talk, mad to be saved, desirous of everything at the same time, the ones who never yawn or say a commonplace thing, but burn, burn, burn, like fabulous yellow roman candles exploding like spiders across the stars and in the middle you see the blue centerlight pop and everybody goes \\"Awww!\\" <br /> <br />Yeah, you know who you are, and you know you will watch this one..
B000EJ9MTW|4.0|There are a lot of recent retro rock bands coming and going, but if this album is any indication, Wolfmother will hang around for a while.  Unlike many of those other bands, these guys *get* classic rock (like The Darkness *get* glam metal).  This disc doesn't just have a 1970 vibe; it really sounds like it came out in 1970.  And the songwriting chops are there -- these are memorable tunes, not throwaway riff-rock. <br /> <br />Upon first hearing it, I wasn't sure how much staying power this material would have, but the more I listen to it, the more I'm digging it.  This stuff rocks! <br />
0393035158|4.0|By page 22 of \\"The End of Faith,\\" the reader is aware that Sam Harris does not feel the least bit conciliatory toward religious worldviews.  Moreover, he knows just how and where to insert an intellectual stiletto:<br /><br />\\"Whatever is true now should be discoverable now....By this measure, the entire project of religion seems perfectly backward.\\"<br /><br />Indeed, religious thinking does seem to have an uncanny knack for being not just wrong, but exactly wrong. For example, it credits the Old Testament god with being merciful, patient, forgiving and wise, although even a cursory reading of Genesis through Numbers shows him to be cruel, petty, vengeful, selfish and embarrassingly ignorant of the cosmos he supposedly designed and constructed.  While highlighting this and many other faith-based nonsequiturs, Harris makes an eloquent case for the proposition that religious claims MUST compete with other knowledge about the world on a fair basis -- no automatic allowances for tradition, \\"sacredness,\\" or other distractions having zero relevance to truth value.  He further warns that given the clear and present dangers of fundamentalism, we risk far too much by sacrificing rationality on the altar of political correctness.<br /><br />The book's seven chapters cover the roots and dangers of religious irrationality, the perverseness of faith without reason, the history of religious persecution and internecine vendettas, the particular threat of Islam, the toxicity of church/government mixtures, a scientific approach to morality, and (rather surprisingly) the experimental side of consciousness.<br /><br />In the chapter on Islam, Harris begins with the obligatory mention of (long past) positive contributions from Muslim culture, notably the invention of algebra and translations of the Greek philosophers.  But the next 40 pages are devoted to exposing the threatening side of Islamic beliefs and traditions  -- even the \\"moderate\\" ones.  Harris points out that the revered Koran and its lower-ranked companion the hadith (sayings of Muhammad) are liberally stocked with contempt for other religions, death sentences for apostates, eternal suffering for infidels, and the promotion of jihad (religious war) as a duty for all Muslims.  He offers statistical evidence that suicide bombing in defense of Islam is endorsed in at least some circumstances by majorities or substantial portions of the populations of 11 of 12 Muslim countries (the lone exception is secular-governed Turkey).  The author maintains, with ample evidence, that the usual characterization of radical Islamists as mere hijackers of a peaceful religion is grossly misleading.  In fact, he says, \\"Nothing explains the actions of Muslim extremists...better than the tenets of Islam.\\"<br /><br />Harris's clear and forceful writing style bolsters his step-by-step case for rejecting the vacuous certainties of religious doctrine.  In Chapter six he tackles the concept of atheistic morality, which seems to trouble so many people.  He keys his outline for scientifically valid ethics to one simple but not widely recognized principle: \\"...questions of right and wrong are really questions about the happiness and suffering of sentient creatures.\\"  By \\"sentient\\" he means conscious and able to comprehend different levels of well-being.  This plausible and incisive idea immediately clarifies important issues to which religious morality is both dumb and blind:<br /><br />1. All human and non-human animals have ethical rights.  Sentience alone is sufficient to confer moral standing.<br /><br />2. The objective of shared ethical standards is to improve the condition of living beings, not to avoid the wrath of an imaginary cosmic supervisor.<br /><br />3. Harmless private behavior is not open to ethical dispute.<br /><br />Harris uses point 1. to illuminate the abortion issue.  If sentience confers moral standing, then lack of sentience removes it.  Hence it is not rational to equate the ethical rights of one, or two, or a hundred cells with those of a fully-developed person.  There is of course a gray area, but it does not (by any sensible standard) reach back to conception.<br /><br />In his sharp (both senses of the word) critique of absolute pacifism, Harris offers on page 202 a very provocative and pithy admonition: \\"...when your enemy has no scruples, your own scruples become another weapon in his hand.\\"<br /><br />Although I found much to admire in \\"End of Faith,\\"  there were some aspects of it that puzzled me.  For instance, on page 16 the author claims that \\"there is clearly a sacred dimension to our existence.\\"  He goes on to say that exploring such a dimension shouldn't require untestable propositions, but the original appeal to sacredness still seems odd.  In other places Harris tentatively supports the reality of psychic phenomena (p. 41), suggests a \\"deeply rational\\" basis for spirituality (p. 43), and states that his case against blind faith was \\"written very much in the spirit of a prayer\\" (pp 48-9).  On page 192 he defines spirituality as cultivation of happiness,  an interpretation very much at odds with any dictionaries I've encountered.  Seventeen pages later he declares that spiritual practice is the investigation of consciousness through introspection.  Will the real spirituality please stand up?  Finally, on page 208, Harris expresses doubt that the brain produces consciousness, but fails to offer a plausible guess at what does produce it.<br /><br />Despite such reservations, I found \\"End of Faith\\" to be a thoughtful work with a cogent and worthwhile theme -- religious claims deserve no special or privileged status among the welter of competing ideas about the universe and our role in it.e the ethical rights of one, or two, or a hundred cells with those of a fully-developed person.

B000EULJLU|5.0|I love this new CD to death, its wonderful <br /> <br />Wings For Marie / 10,000 Days the song is quite possibly my favorite song in the history of music right now, its amazing <br /> <br />The rest of the songs are great as well, there isn't a single moment i dislike in all ~75 minutes <br /> <br />Lost Keys and Rosetta Stoned are also amazing songs, make sure you find some lyrics when you listen though, cause you won't be able to tell what's going on. <br /> <br />And the case for this CD is enough justification for paying $10 for music.  BUY THE CD.  Use iTunes if you must but you will be missing out big time on the case.
1592400876|5.0|Like most adults these days, my grammar and punctuation could do with some work. Thanks to this book, however, it doesn't need quite as much help as it used to. As a person who abhored English class as a kid, it wasn't until my early 20's when I finally, of my own volition and not the teacher's, decided to try and learn how to write a little better. I've still gots me some learnins to do, but some common (and not so common) errors I have corrected thanks to this. <br /> <br />The book is light and highly readable. Although Mr Buxton, who reviewed this book earlier, took issue with the writer's pompous tone, I found it added to the book. She is, afterall, British; we have to expect that a British pundit is going to have a certain tone about him or her, but I didn't find hers was over the top. Her subtly dismissive tone and humour throughout made the book quite unlike a grind--which I remember all classes in English used to be. <br /> <br />I imagine she isn't correct in all cases. Writing is an area in which people love to debate. Arguing the minutiae is something that should be done (by people who are bored) once the foundation is laid and this book helps to lay it. It is a great selling book because it takes an inherently (to most people) uninteresting subject material and makes it digestible to the commoner. <br /> <br />It is not a book on writing per se, but rather punctuation. It won't belabour the benefits of structuring a sentence in a certain way. What it will do is belabour the contrast between 'you're' and 'your', 'it's' and 'its', etc. These are basic, grade 3 (or should be) things that so many people do not understand. Now that I've read the book, I notice them all the time. More people should read it. <br /> <br />I bet that a lot of people writing reviews on this book spent a lot of time ensuring their punctuation was flawless. I didn't put more effort in than normal, and if I missed out in areas it's because I need to re-read the book :)
B00005U122|5.0|This DVD captures Waters and his all-star band at their best. Most of the Pink Floyd classics are played.  Waters mixes in some of his solo material as well.<br /><br />The show appears to be broken into segments; each to honor a particular album.  The show opens with a 4 song salute to \\"The Wall.\\"  \\"In the Flesh,\\" \\"Happiest Days of our Lives,\\" and \\"Another Brick in the Wall 2\\" are all true to the original versions.  The guitar solo in \\"Mother\\" tingled my spine.<br /><br />A couple of songs from \\"The Final Cut\\" are played; somewhat of a rest for the show.  This allows the viewer to take a breath in anticipation for what comes next.<br /><br />The next part of the show focuses on the Floyd classic album \\"Animals.\\"  This can be summarized with one word - \\"Dogs.\\"<br /><br />\\"Wish You Were Here,\\" is a very underrated Floyd Album.  \\"Shine on You Crazy Diamond,\\" is played in full with incredible percision.  \\"Welcome to the Machine\\" is accominapied by the classic Floyd visuals.<br /><br />\\"Set The Controls for the Heart of the Sun\\" is the one song in the set from the very early days of Floyd.<br /><br />The DVD reaches its peak as Waters and company pay tribute to \\"Dark Side of the Moon.\\"  \\"Breathe,\\" \\"Time,\\" \\"Money,\\" \\"Brain Dmage,\\" and \\"Eclipse,\\" are all played.  These songs have stood the test of time for the past 30 years and likely will be listened to by music fans 100 years from now.  Timeless.<br /><br />Waters then reaches in to his solo catalog with cuts from \\"Pros and Cons of Hitchhiking,\\" and \\"Amused to Death.\\"  Good stuff, but not Floyd.<br /><br />The show is closed with stunning versions of \\"Comfortably Numb,\\" and \\"Each Small Candle.\\"<br /><br />While Waters is the obvious focus of the DVD, I found Doyle Bramhall II to be the star of the show.  Bramhall plays most of the lead guitar and sings many of the parts orginally sung by David Gilmour.  Bramhall absoluyely blisters his guitar.  The rest of the band is very good too.<br /><br />In summary, if you like Floyd buy this DVD NOW!
B0006GAOJA|2.0|What makes a movie great?  What are you looking for in a movie?  The answers to those questions will determine your reaction to this movie.<br /><br />There's a lot of realism here, though not in the boxing scenes.  I haven't yet seen a realistic boxing scene in a movie.  I've watched maybe hundreds of boxing matches, but I've never seen boxing done accurately in a movie, and it is nowhere near accurate here.  It is laughable here, as usual.  Overly dramatic, the punches way too noisy, the reactions of the fighters way too stupid and unrealistic, like LaMotta standing along the ropes with one hand on the ropes, neither hand even trying to protect his head, while Robinson pummels him.  Yeah, right, whatever.  No effing way.  And that moment with Robinson raising one fist slowly.  Spare me.  That was just stupid, boxing for non-fans in a dream world.  Maybe you think this bit of unrealism is artistic, but if you are a boxing fan you see it for what it is, overdramatic nonsense that doesn't look anywhere near real.<br /><br />If you enjoy that scene because it shows how the hero ignored his own safety and opened himself up to pain, and you like identifying with that macho behavior, well go have a beer and picture yourself as this character.  To me, it's just baloney.  It's like that silly Rocky nonsense, completely unreal, a macho fantasy, a little kid thing.<br /><br />But the rest of this movie, pseudo-boxing scenes aside, is too real.  It is about a guy who makes a mess of his life.  There's a lot of agita in this movie as the lead character behaves like a jealous and paranoid violent dictatorial jerk.  That's not easy to watch and it's not enjoyable to watch either.<br /><br />There was a Bogart film noir film like this one.  Bogart played a jealous and violent guy who messes everything up.  I didn't like that movie either.  It was like cod liver oil.  You watch it, you realize that the main character has a lot wrong with him that is painful to watch, you applaud it for being realistic because some people are that way, and when the movie is over you are glad it's over and you don't have to go through it anymore.<br /><br />It's hard, as a reviewer, to realize that other people have other things they are looking for in a movie.  Look at this site.  So many people are calling Raging Bull one of the greatest movies ever made.  I don't get it.  Why?  What are they looking for in a movie?  To me, this was just a lot of agita with no payoff.  This didn't deliver what I'm looking for in a movie.  It just basically annoyed me from start to finish.<br /><br />I didn't get the female character at all.  I don't know what her game was.  It wasn't fleshed out.  She was a cardboard wife, pretty much.  I didn't see a real person there.  I think one weakness of Scorsese as a director is that he doesn't understand women on screen.  They don't really matter either.  They are just props.  This isn't about them.  They are just there to be the lover, the cheater, fill one role or other in the lives of the men.<br /><br />So it seems to me that all the rave reviews on this site are kidding themselves.  This movie really isn't Great with a capital G.  No, it isn't.  And since I didn't enjoy following this crazy man's messed up life, since I was happy when they started showing the credits and I could be free of this annoying and messed up man's problems, I can't even give it three stars.pplaud it for being realistic because some people are that way, and when the movie is over you are glad it's over and you don't have to go through it anymore. <br /> <br />It's hard, as a reviewer, to realize that other people have other things they are looking for in a movie.

B000EULJLU|5.0|...and worth it.  I'll be high on this one just as long I was on Aenima.
B000000H4V|5.0|Sepultura released their 4th album in 1993 titled \\"Chaos A.D.\\" and it quickly became their best album. This album although still death metal isn't extreme like \\"Beneath the Remains\\" and \\"Arise\\". It has more normal thrash metal elements. They also in some of their songs have a Brazilian tribal drum because Sepultura are from Brazil after all. The lyrics are more political than any other Sepultura album actually. Max Cavelera's an awesome vocalist especially among death metal vocalists. His song-writing is also superb and he's an awesome rhythem guitarist while Andreas Kisser handles all the solos. This is Sepultura's best album. Their follow up \\"Roots\\" was a bit slower and lighter but was still awesome. Buy all of Sepultura's albums from \\"Beneath the Remains\\" to \\"Roots\\". Their first two albums weren't very good at all. Avoid anything from that idiot Derrick Green. He sucks bad! He's the Blaze Bailey, Tim \\"Ripper\\" Owens, or Michale Graves of death metal.If you want to catch Max Cavalera now, he's in his new band Soulfly.
B000EULJLU|5.0|Man I see people don't get this album. 4 stars for a tool album? maybe for opiate but come on! you've got to listen to it more than once... it's TOOL! same with a perfect circle. maynard deserves better. this album is incredible
B000001FOS|5.0|Odyssey and Marching Out tie for the best Malmsteen albums. I like Odyssey for the catchy, melodic songs that just keep begging to be played over and over. Marching Out was a metal slaughter-fest that just plain rocked. <br /> <br />Although a little cheesy in places, Odyssey is just fun to listen to. So many memorable lyrics and great riffs, I just wish the lyrics could have been a little stronger. And the sound quality is superb. Only two other CDs seem as crisp and clear to me: Metallica's \\"Garage, Inc.\\" and Candlemass's self-titled album. Every note comes through perfectly and the music sounds \\"full\\" and complete. This CD wraps you in sound. Very nice. <br /> <br />Every song on Odyssey is a masterpiece. Even the slow, thoughtful songs still sound \\"heavy\\" enough, but the music is emotionally moving at the same time. And Joe Lynn Turner is at his best on this album.
0399241523|5.0|Ark Angle kept my son's attention and it was very exciting.  Alex always gets into tight squeezes but gets out somehow.  I highly recommend Ark Angel.
015603252X|5.0|I decided to read this novel-like memoir after watching a program about it on Greek TV, and also after an American anti-Israel friend told me that he found a radio interview with the author \\"very moving\\". As other reviewers have pointed out, it's not easy reading, and the degree of detail can be tiring at times. But I am glad I read it, and I would heartily recommend it to others as a good introduction to Israel.    Why so many details? One answer is \\"because the author, being such a famous writer, could\\". Another answer is that this was the only way to portray and compare Jewish life before and after Israel. For example, the excruciating emphasis on his grandmother's obsession with 'Levantine germs and viruses' is suddenly followed by a telling  episode that marked her arrival to Haifa: as a British doctor attempted to spray his grandfather with disinfectant, the author's father grabbed the spray and doused the doctor instead -- for Jewish honor \\"should no longer be trampled underfoot or disinfected\\"!    Another great 'surprise' is the way the author's tragic mother really 'enters' the memoir: right after his father is meticulously shown to receive the first copy of his book with unimaginable affection and liken it to a newborn baby, his mother dryly retorts \\"when it's time to change its nappy, I expect you'll call me\\".    Is the author's mother's suicide presented as a metaphor for the pains of Israel's birth? I would say yes, even if indirectly and unintentionally: her suicide took place in the same room that noted Israeli general and archeologist Yigael Yadin was renting during the War of Independence; less poetically, her death compelled the author to leave Jerusalem for a kibbutz, moving from the abstract Zionist ideals and debates to the reality of toiling on the Land of Israel.    Will this book be remembered as the saga of modern Israel? Perhaps, although the absence of Sephardic Jews and -- despite the author's 'accidental' visit to a wealthy Arab home --Palestinian Arabs reduce its chances substantially. Still, if you read it Jerusalem will never be the same!    One last note: I read the excellent Greek translation of Yaakov Schiby and, comparing it to Nicholas de Lange's English translation, I am stunned to see that the latter has omitted one of the 63 sections (where the author writes about novels and writing) and generally altered the text here and there; as a glaring example, only 2 of 10 lines from Zelda Schneurson-Mishkovsky's -- author's second grade teacher in pre-Israel Jerusalem -- magnificent poem \\"In an Old School for the Blind\\" cited by the author (and the Greek translator) appear in the English translation:   \\"For the first time I am thinking  about a night when the constellations are only a rumour\\"...       [*12/20/07 EDIT*: I have good reasons by now to believe that the poem's author is not the teacher but the student (i.e., Amos Oz himself); in any case, here is how the Greek translation rescues that shadowy poem:            \\"Why has the mountains' contempt scared me so much          My soul landed here like a bird flying          from the land of a fruit that never tasted...          That the night's garden violated its vow to the tender darkness          For the first time ever I ponder          a night in which the constelations and the degrees          are but a rumor            ......................................................            But when am I going to feel that its darkness          is full of signs,          that I know nothing about its soul's journeys          into the magic, the profound, the luminous,          the impossible\\"    This incident shows how fiction and fact may be weaved into each other in Oz's 'Tale': whether this was done randomly or with a pro-Israel agenda in mind I am leaving to others to investigate; what I would like to do here instead is to cite, straight from the English translation, the one marvelous paragraph where the author casts a bit of affectionate doubt on Israel (through an aunt's narration of her 1938 journey, along with a Greek and her baby, from Trieste to Tel Aviv):    \\"I even remember that at one moment I had a fleeting thought, why did I  have to go to the Land of Israel at all? Just to be among Jews? Yet this  Greek girl, who probably didn't even know what a Jew was, was closer to me  than the entire Jewish people. The entire Jewish people seemed to me at  that moment like a great sweaty mass whose belly I was being tempted to  enter, so it could consume me entirely with its digestive juices, and I  said to myself, Sonia, is that what you really want? It's curious that in  Rovno I'd never experienced this fear, that I was going to be consumed by  the digestive juices of the Jewish people. It never came back once I was  here, either. It was just then, for a moment, on that boat, on the way,  when the Greek baby fell asleep in my lap and I could feel it through my  dress as though at that moment she really was flesh of my flesh, even  though she wasn't Jewish, and despite the wicked Jew-hating Antiochus  Epiphanes.\\"]
B000005S0E|4.0|Robert's uncomfortable vocals on this record make it unlistenable for most people who aren't Cure fans. But, for those of us who like the band, we can appreciate how they fit the music.    This record has some great songs, like Piggy in the Mirror and Birdmad Girl. Give Me It is one track I always skip, however.
B000002UAU|4.0|Having read many reviews on this site for Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band, it's very obvious that any review that doesn't give this album credit for being one of the top 10 albums in history will get negative feedback from the vast majority. I guess objective comments don't count for much when reviewing this particular theme album, only favorable ones. Here goes, anyway. I love the Beatles with a passion. I have every single album they ever made, including compilation albums and even an old LP of the Beatles live in Germany in 1962 (recorded on an old hand-held reel-to-reel tape recorder and very grainy... but I LOVE it!). The Beatles were riding high in 1967 when Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band was introduced to us. At the time, a theme album was a novel concept and very fresh, and The Beatles were given much-deserved kudos for having mastered a different sound. The Beatles could do no wrong in 1967, and this album is proof. I recall some of my friends talking about what a fantastic album it was, but I noticed they rarely ever listened to it unless they were high. Indeed, many of the songs on SPLHCB are psychedelic in nature and almost seem to cater to the less sober listeners among us. While I like this album immensely, I have to say that by today's standards, a fresh listen reveals many songs to be quite strange and others pretty ordinary. Again, I realize this review will be either panned by this crowd or else completely blown off, but as a true Beatles fan, this is my honest opinion. The first two songs are true classics. \\"Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band\\" and \\"With A Little Help From My Friends.\\" Beautiful! \\"Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds\\" is an ordinary song, IMHO, and not to sound blasphemous to other fans, but I truly thought Elton John's version was much better. This is one of the strange songs that the 'psychedelic' crowd seemed to embrace. \\"Getting Better\\" is a nice tune. I like it very much, and \\"Fixing a Hole\\" is above average. After this, though, the album becomes bogged down a bit by silly songs such as \\"Being for the Benefit of Mr. Kite\\", \\"When I'm Sixty-Four\\" (although the tune is quite catchy) and \\"Good Morning, Good Morning\\", as well as sappy tunes like \\"She's Leaving Home\\" (this one becomes a bit tedious halfway through it) and \\"Within You, Without You\\" (which I actually like, however not as much as those who call this one of the best Beatles songs ever. I like it despite the Eastern flavor. That sound just never did anything for me.) \\"Lovely Rita\\" is a definite keeper and the album winds itself up nicely with the 'heavier' version of \\"SPLHCB\\" and \\"A Day in the Life\\", two EXCELLENT songs. I guess my whole point is that, although I love this album, I feel it has gotten far too much credit for being among the best ever. Yes, it was very creative for it's time, but there are just too many ordinary songs mixed in with the legendary ones to maintain that status over the years. Some of the album almost seems to have been recorded for the benefit of listeners on LSD or something. So, go ahead, Beatles fans, use me as your new punching bag, just remember that I really am one of YOU! The fact is I like this album a LOT, I just think it's been a bit overrated. I give it four stars because 1) It was a very creative and novel concept in 1967, 2) it really is an excellent album, although far from perfect and 3) it's the BEATLES, for crying out loud! :-)) Peace.
B000002H4Q|3.0|Firstly, the CD is still missing Hey You, even though modern CD players can play 80 minute discs. Further, it's missing the songs Breathe and A Chain of Flowers, which are B-sides that should have been included since they're better than songs that made the cut like Torture, Fight, and The Perfect Girl. <br /> <br />This CD desperately needs to come out in remastered form (no clipping or compression in the remastering process, please) with Breathe, A Chain of Flowers, and Hey You.
B000B8QEZG|4.0|The review by Porfie Medina \\"Porfie Jr. Medina\\" (should be the first review) is wrong several areas: <br /> <br />GET TOGETHER does NOT contain a sample of Stardust's Music Sounds Better With You. <br /> <br />FUTURE LOVERS does NOT contain a sample of Donna Summer's I Feel Love.  Part of the song is an homage to Giorgio Moroder.  No sample involved. <br /> <br />LET IT WILL BE does NOT sample Madonna's own Papa Don't Preach.  In fact, the two string parts sound nothing alike. <br /> <br />PUSH does NOT sample Madonna's own Like a Prayer. <br /> <br /> <br />I won't even start on the grammatical errors in his review...
0380789019|4.0|I've been a big fan of Neil Gaiman's comic books for many years and thought it was high time I gave one of his novels a shot. Neverwhere was the book I chose and it lived up to all my expectations. A modern day fairy tale, Neverwhere is a typical Neil Gaiman comic book sans the pictures. It's an enchanting fantasy set in present day London (the perfect setting for a story like this) where an ordinary bloke is unwittingly thrown into a dark, dangerous and fantastical underworld that invisibly exists alongside the contemporary London to which he belongs. The book is a fast paced, quick read that is told for the most part, in a continuous narrative. This was refreshing to me in the sense that the trend of most books I have read lately is that each chapter switches to a different character's story and those individual narratives are then tied together at a later point in the novel. It was nice to just stick with the same crowd from cover to cover. <br /> <br />Gaiman thoroughly and imaginatively describes the world in which he is taking us through, giving us enough information and descriptions about the places and characters to keep us fascinated but leaving enough out to allow our own imaginations to wonder how things got to be that way. Consequently, we are left at the end of the novel craving further adventures and more insight into London Underworld. I truly hope that Gaiman returns to Neverwhere because it is ripe for further exploration and story telling. <br />
B000EULJLU|5.0|Tool sound here as if they did what any artist's got to: go as far as one can and then try to extrapolate.  I believe they swung it.  When CDs first appeared I wasn't too happy with how the idea of the 'album' had changed since I started buying music.  How the hell is a composer supposed to fill all that damn space? Suddenly filler is a tantalizing concept.  Not so hot if you value the way an 'album' flows from song to song.  In the 1950s Elvis Presley could get away with 10 minutes on the side of an LP.  When the LP died an 'album' was considered to be about 45 minutes.  Now a band's got to come up with 70 minutes of music to fill a CD, in the case of this one 75.  No wonder it took the guys 5 years to get this CD on the market. <br />     Was worth the wait though, in my humble opinion.  No filler here, I even get a kick out of 'Viginti Tres'' slow voices and muddied synth.  Tool take a hell of a chance on '10,000 Days': they expand their vocabulary, they toy with tempos, dynamics and structures a lot more than on 'Lateralus,' and they barely crook a finger at the listener while walking away, never really bothering to look back and see if we're following.  You gotta like that.  Geez, they think we have brains and we can use them.  'Aenima' and 'Lateralus' took over the listening room; '10,000 Days' prefers to mesmerize,  dragging you into the speakers.  Subtle and hammering by turns, the 'Wings' suite, for example, builds from a whisper to a scream again and again.  Adam Jones' flamenco electric guitar figure is a joy, Maynard James Keenan's voice thrums in a net of bass and cymbals.  No, it won't make your dorm mate bring you up on charges with the residence moderator (not until later in the song, anyway), but it's what can be done with the form in the hands of a master.  Danny Carey's cymbal work could be a jazz drummer's, as melodic as some keyboard players are, and the slow boil of 'Part 2' is nicely underlined by rainstorm sound effects.  Made me flash on the Doors' \\"Riders on the Storm\\"... what is it with L.A. bands doing tunes with rain in them?  Because it almost never does, over there?  But Keenan has other things on his mind, doing a 'Prodigal Son' thing (\\"My time now!  Give me mine! Give me mine!\\").  Very effective.  Another reviewer name-checked President Junior (among other dubious personalities)  while listening to this one... thanks, my man, gave me a big laugh.  Seeing what's going on in the Middle East lately, I need one.  \\"Vicarious\\" sports a trademark Tool bass riff, Justin Chancellor doing a near 'rhythm guitar' motif that's similar to what I used to hear from Peter Hook in Joy Division.  This melody is so damn good, I almost forget to listen to the words (the nice thing about televisions is, they all come with 'off' switches... yeah, why CAN'T we just admit it?).  'Right In Two,' by turns murderously taut and jouncing with odd percussives, recalls the opening scene of Stanley Kubrick's '2001' ('Monkey killing monkey killing monkey,' and so forth; 'my bad' if I didn't hear that right); kicks ass.  Doesn't even bother me that it and the even more lunatic \\"Rosetta Stoned\\" do ricochet a little bit off 'Third Eye.' The only tune I'm not too fond of here, and this is just me, is \\"Jambi\\"; I don't know, I get the feeling that the productions's a little off, or maybe the guitar needed to be louder.  But then, over the years I've worn out 4 copies of 'Black Sabbath Volume 4': maybe I'm finally going deaf. <br />     Well, I'm glad my ears still sort of work. Try this.  You will too.  And yes, I agree with a lot of the other listeners here: it might even be a cure for ADD.
B0000630BT|5.0|\\"Painkiller\\" by Judas Priest is definatly the best album the band has ever put out! After those two cr a p-fests \\"Turbo\\" and \\"Ram it Down\\" which were super poppy albums, Priest puts out an album that's the complete opposite of those two stinkers! It's a thrash metal masterpiece that completly blowed everyone away and wasn't MTV friendly like \\"Turbo\\" and \\"Ram it Down\\". Their best since \\"Defenders of the Faith\\"! This album had a new drummer Scott Travis. My favorite songs are the title track, \\"A Touch of Evil\\", \\"Metal Meltdown\\", and \\"One Shot at Glory\\". BUY THIS NOW!!!
B000E1155E|1.0|Man, what a total disappointment - this album is STONE DULL. Once again, just because you think you can play a guitar / drums / bass does NOT mean you have talent. This stuff might work if I heard it played live in a warehouse, but I doubt it. This album is nothing but a paltry Strokes imitation. Even FIOE is better than THIS, and that's saying something. After all the press, I thought I was going to hear something exciting. That wasn't the case. I kept looking at the time remaining on the cd player, sorely waiting for it to end. I don't think I've heard worse singing / lyrics since \\"Separation Sunday\\" by The Hold Steady - consider the Arctic Monkeys their UK equivalent.
B000002MP2|4.0|im not really a green day fanatic, but i must say this album is good. i only like green day, the old school green day if u know what i mean. not the green day now. they're corporate sell outs and overrated,... sorry green day hardcores! (hey still i gave it 4 stars)
B000EULJLU|5.0|To all Tool junkies out there if you are buying this CD to experience Tool from years ago than by all means pop in those early CD's and commence to listening. If you are like me and ready to listen to somthing so brilliant and so evolving then pop 10,000 days in, sit back and enjoy the ride. Yes it does take several times before this CD will grow on you but once you actully sit down and \\"Listen\\" to the music and lyrics you will find pure genius here at heart. Take note everyone, Tool is a band that has grown up and is ready to experience all that life has to offer, and they are here to share it with all of us through their passionate music.
B000BHIKRM|5.0|Orson Welles was a genius in filmmaking in the same way that Lord Laurence Olivier could act Shakespeare. He was inspired by Randolph Hearst's life, the publishing tycoon. The film is probably just flawless. It's not too long or too short. It has the finest cast together including the divine Agnes Moorhead, Dorothy Comingore, Joseph Cotten, Ruth Warrick, and even the master, Orson Welles. He got into a lot of trouble making this film but it's worth it even in black and white. The acting is superb and the writing and directing are equally flawless. You won't find better. IT's still the number one film of all time for a reason.
B000ETQRCM|5.0|First I'll say the recent reviewer saying Pearl Jam makes the same album over and over again is dead wrong. Pearl Jam is the epitomy of a classic rock band that changes its sound from record to record. They've never had a specific formula for writing songs and they experiment plenty. I can tell he's never listened to No Code or Yield before. Both albums were very experimental(thanks to drummer Jack Irons) and they've continued to evolve since then. Also I recommend readers of these reviews not to listen to any that say Mike McCready is no where to be found because they're lying. They obviously haven't listened to the CD more than once and even then it was probably the horrible quality of the ripped version. Mike is all over this album with some great guitar solos stretching 30 seconds. All of them are well placed and he really shines. <br /> <br />This album shows PJ at their finest with some more new firsts for the band. Eddie, in particular, as a different way of singing in some songs like Unemployable or Inside Job. Then in other songs you have his signature growls dripping with passion. This is a great rock album that show all those crappy artistically flat bands like Nickelback how it's really done. The politics aren't over the head bashing you senseless so even Bush supporters like myself won't be upset to the point of not enjoying the music. If anyone is they take life and politics way too seriously. This will be talked about as the best album of the year come December 2006.
0064400018|4.0|I introduced my daughter to the works of Laura Ingalls Wilder with LITTLE HOUSE IN THE BIG WOODS.  This is a wonderful book, following the seasonal changes in the ordinary life of a late nineteenth-century Wisconsin family.  My seven-year old loved, for instance, the story of the two bears; she laughed out loud when she heard how Pa discovered that the latter bear in this story, which he encountered in the dark on his way home from town, was but a burned tree stump.  Laura Ingalls Wilder tells this story with suspense, humor, and a depiction of genuine family closeness.<br /><br />In reading other stories in this book, my daughter imagined what it would have been like to have seen a town for the first time, and she was enthralled with the chapter on the (maple) sugaring party.<br /><br />This book, like its famous sequel, LITTLE HOUSE ON THE PRAIRIE, includes terrific, sometimes somewhat long accounts of how certain mundane jobs or chores were accomplished in those days.  Be forewarned that some children might grow restless, but they might also, as my daughter did, listen with some interest even through these parts.<br /><br />This is good, plain, innocent even naive writing.  In some respects it is, perhaps, not politically correct by our standards.  It's not going to be to every child's liking.  But I urge parents to give it a try; your children might surprise you, and respond to it with fondness, enthusiasm, and intelligence.<br /><br />With respect to the age of a prospective child reader, my daughter did not find it too difficult.  She did, however, end up listening to me read much of the book to her.
B00026WU82|5.0|I was all of 12 when this record came out.  I didn't really get to hear the whole thing until much later, when I was 15 or 16, but of course \\"Like A Rolling Stone\\" was all over the radio that year and everyone was abuzz about \\"folk rock\\"--which in the popular press included everyone from the Byrds to Sonny & Cher.  It was an exciting time.  As David Crosby once said, it was rock'n'roll with literate lyrics.  And by '65, it felt like high time too. <br /> <br />When I finally did get around to listening to the complete album much of the controversy around it had diminished.  Dylan going electric?  Of course, it had to happen.  Dylan abandoning the overtly socio-political lyrics of \\"Blowin' In the Wind\\" etc. in favor of surreal, druggy and depressive lyrics like \\"Desolation Row.\\" It was a necessary artistic development, looking back at it all a few years later.  The times were a-changin' and Dylan changed along with them.  Or ahead of them. <br /> <br />It's easy to see why electric Dylan alienated many folk traditionalists.  But he knew exactly what he was doing and where he was going.  He assembled a superlative back-up band featuring blues rockers Bloomfield and Kooper and developed a sound so rich and textured that it now can only be viewed as inevitable.  \\"Like A Rolling Stone\\" has been in a generation's bloodstream for so long now, it's hard to remember how revolutionary a sound that was.  The swelling keyboards, the rambling harmonica, it was all very bold in '65.  Forty one years later, it still sounds great. <br /> <br />There will always be some controversy as to just what Dylan's masterpiece is.  But this album was a breakthrough, and it's no surprise that it's the favorite of many fans.  This or BLONDE ON BLONDE?  BLOOD ON THE TRACKS?  Pointless arguments really.  They're all essential, all great.  And each captures the Zeitgeist of its era perfectly.  Or perhaps it's more accurate to say he defined it. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
0142004413|4.0|From a young age, Gerald Durrell, an early environmental preservationist, had a love for all types of animals. This interest was greatly encouraged during the five years Durrell and his family lived on the island of Corfu, an undeveloped paradise before WWII. Durrell's calm and rather long-suffering mother brought her three sons, including the not-yet-acclaimed writer Lawrence Durell, and daughter to the island as antidote to England's year-round gloomy weather. A warm and witty look at an eccentric British family also introduces the reader to the rustic residents of Corfu and flora and fauna ranging from insects to owls. This wonderful family read-aloud for ages 12 and up.
B000002LGA|5.0|I was such a huge fan of the Velvets as a teenager (growing up in Maine which sometimes seems to surprise people who did not grow up in Maine) that it almost became something of a surprise when I very gradually, over the course of many years, kind of broke off my aural relationship with Lou Reed the solo artist.  I'm not quite sure how it happened, but I went from \\"Oh, Wow! Lou's got a new album.\\" to \\"Hmmm. I see Lou's released something new.  I wonder when it'll hit the cut-out bins.\\"  And then eventually I reached a point where I'd forget to check out the cut out bins a year or so later.    Actually, it's probably inaccurate to describe this shift as a kind of \\"break up.\\"  It was more like losing touch with an old friend.  You keep meaning to check in, but somehow don't get around to it.  And that can be a shame really.  Sometimes you forget how sharp, how incisive and witty an old friend can be.  Checking in from time to time goes beyond nostalgia value.  It can be a source of renewal and rediscovery.    I've long been aware that NEW YORK was considered by many to be one of Lou's latterday masterpieces, but it still took forever for me to get around to really listening to it.  I had been largely indifferent to much of his 80s music.  How could I have guessed that he would have closed out that decade with such a bang?    I suppose it was high time that Lou dedicated an album to his home turf.  His first \\"city\\" album BERLIN took place in Nico's old stomping grounds, but that was more about its characters than its setting (which I gather Lou really was not particularly familiar with).  NEW YORK has characters, it has setting, it has myth and harsh reality.  In short, it does everything Lou has traditionally done when he is at his best.    And there's not a bad track on it.  From the jagged street romance poetry of \\"Romeo Had Juliet\\" to the mytho-poeic \\"Last Great American Whale\\" to the somber, meditative \\"Dimestore Mystery,\\" this is music that radiates intelligence--and something not every Reed album possessed--a real vision.      I'm sorry I lost touch.
B000ETQRCM|3.0|\\"The Best PJ in 10 years\\" \\"back to the old days\\". I dunno folks. I like the album. Army Reserve, Marker in the Sand, Gone, Come Back and Inside Job are very good songs. Many comments I have read say that this album ends the funk of Binaural and the hideous Riot Act. Hmmmm... Binaural is good, but I really like Riot Act! It's not Ten... it's not hard edged. But it is a great CD. Yes there is filler.... all PJ has filler (except Ten. And I admit the new PJ doesn't have filler either). But it has great songs- PJ is good at rockers, but some of their slower more accoustic songs I think are some of their best (my personal favs of all PJ are Black and Release). Now back to the new album. Yes- it belongs on my CD rack next to all my other PJ CD's (except Vitology which I hated and do not own! Like I said- I'm the atypical PJ fan). I wouldn't call it their best in ten years. Every CD they have made in the last few years has moments of brilliance next to... ummm... less than stellar material. If you like Pearl Jam you need to buy it. If you are blown away GREAT!!! I can't share your enthusiasm, but I will enjoy the disk. I didn't waste my money. Guess I'm getting old... slower music appeals to me- sometimes more than hard rocking stuff (so the last two cd's I bought were David Gilmours' \\"On An Island\\", which is very mellow, yet amazing (the tour was incredible! Looking forward to the DVD with Echoes on it!!!) and Tool 10,000 Days... which, in spite of negative comments I've seen, I'm enjoying a lot- more than the new PJ. There ya go.
B000EULJLU|3.0|After four sittings of '10,000 Days', (none of which have been in it's entirety), I am still baffled to whether I dig it or am disappointed by it. More so than any other Tool record, the spacious interludes break up the positive momentum of the more driving tracks. My attention drifts off on '10,000 Days' at about the 7th track mark, something which is rare regarding my love of the majority of Tool's work. I'm pretty sure that with a few more listerns, a greater understanding of the album will raise it's appeal with me as time definately improved my regard for 'Lateralus'.  <br /> <br />Putting the negitive aside, the opening track 'Vicarious' and track 5 'The Pot' are so perfectly Tool in every sence that the album is worth picking up just for these two magic moments. The production is flawless and monsterious in weight, although Maynard's vocals are buried in the mix which has never occured on any previous Tool disk. It would have been nice to hear him more in the front as his superb melodies, phrasing and lyrics are partially lost under the power of the band. <br /> <br />Too early to decide......
B000AMJG4Y|5.0|You do not have to be a Final Fantasy aficionado to appreciate this film.  It is a visual master-piece.  The imagery is absolutely stunning.  You may need to watch it a few times to understand it fully, but each time you will discover something about it that you had not discovered before.  And if you find yourself thinking things like \\"humans can't jump that high\\" or \\"no one could weild a sword that heavy\\", remember: THAT'S THE POINT!  It's a fantasy, a window to a world where anything can happen.  A dream where you can do things that are not otherwise possible in reality. <br /> <br />I highly recommend watching the film in its original Japanese dialogue.  The English version is a good translation in meaning, but it doesn't have the same feeling as the Japanese.  The creators went to great lengths to match up the guestures and mouth movements precisely with the Japanese language. <br /> <br />The soundtrack is wonderful too.  Every aspect about this movie is A+.  The only bad part is that it eventually has to come to an end.
006056251X|5.0|Lisa Kleypas is the Joe Dimaggio of historical romance, hitting home runs and making it look easy with her smooth, sensual and satisfying stories of love and luxury and desire.<br /><br />Sexy and suave Sebastien is a bad boy. Sinfully handsome, but still a very bad boy. The last time we saw him, in \\"Autumn,\\" he was trying desperately to kidnap an American heiress for her money and getting beaten to a bloody pulp for his trouble. Bruised and bloody and aching all over, he retreats to his lair, meaning to brood away the hours and seek forgetfulness in the welcoming arms of the nearest brandy bottle.<br /><br />Just as he is beginning to feel the usual soothing effects, however, Sebastien is roused from his torpor by the arrival of a most unexpected guest. Evie Jenner is a nobody, a wall flower of common birth whom Sebastien has been ignoring all summer. But Evie has money -- and a desperate plan. Pursued by her own rapacious relations, she seeks safety in a marriage of convenience to a man she knows to be weak, cruel and heartless. Her matter of fact attitude, and her courage, stir something in Sebastien. Something very different stirs as he becomes aware of her flaming red hair and magnificently ample figure -- virtues that the shy, frightened Evie kept carefully hidden during the social season.<br /><br />The love story between Sebastien and Evie is nearly perfect, and it takes them from the gaming hells of London to the wilds of Scotland. The one complaint I have is that the villain in this book is no match for Sebastien. He's a yucky, diseased low life who literally crawls out of the woodwork on cue, mumbles a few obscenities in Evie's general direction, and is dispatched with ridiculous ease. I know Lisa Kleypas can do better than this! In the last book, the villain was sexier than the hero -- mainly because he turned out to be Sebastien. It's getting really annoying in these romances, too, when the villain threatens the heroine early on and she says, \\"oh, no, don't tell my husband -- he'll want to save me in the last chapter.\\" I kid you not, Evie comes very close to using these very words!<br /><br />But it's okay -- this book is still a classic, and the way Sebastien goes from cruel and cynical (and drunk) to tender and passionate and totally wrapped around Evie's finger is really something to cherish.<br /><br />Dimaggio always makes it look easy -- and so does Lisa Kleypas.\\"oh, no, don't tell my husband -- he'll want to save me in the last chapter.\\" I kid you not, Evie comes very close to using these very words!       <br /> <br />But it's okay -- this book is still a classic, and the way Sebastien goes from cruel and cynical (and drunk) to tender and passionate and totally wrapped around Evie's finger is really something to cherish.  <br /> <br />Dimaggio always makes it look easy -- and so does Lisa Kleypas.  <br /> <br /> <br />
B00082IJ08|5.0|Some people have trouble listening to entire albums without skipping at least one track.  I don't.  Even if I don't love every song, if I felt enough like listening to the band to actually start it up, I can usually tolerate the weaker songs while I'm at it.  I even tend to grow to like those songs on some level anyway.  There are several albums I have where I do at least strongly like every song on them, though.  The one thing that's pretty rare is for me to be able to specifically remember what all the songs sound like just by reading the titles.  Demon Days is one of those are few. <br /> <br />The fact that Damon Albarn and company are able to mix such a range of genres and artists and keep all the songs unique while also creating a sense of cohesion, on top of making them all so catchy and enjoyable at the same time, is an astonishing achievement.  There's rap, there's rock, there's electronica and dub and dance, there's spoken word and choir, and it's all extremely fun to listen to.  My collection is almost exclusively rock, but I still find this to be one of my favorite albums to listen to.  There's just something about the seamless blending of styles that makes you want to throw all your cares to the wind and just enjoy what you're listening to. <br /> <br />\\"Last Living Souls\\" has the most amazingly infectious electronic beat going through it the whole time.  It's so good.  \\"O Green World\\" has a very catchy vocal part and is another fun song.  The single \\"Feel Good Inc\\" mixes a great base line and rap from De La Soul with the acoustic chorus very well.  \\"Every Planet We Reach Is Dead\\" has a title that reflects the supposed darker tone of the album in relation to Gorillaz' self-titled debut, and the catchy melody reflects that in an odd way.  \\"November Has Come\\" has probably the best rapping on the album.  The song \\"All Alone\\" combines a driving synth part with some strange vocals that I really like.  \\"DARE\\" is just a blast, with the two vocal parts coming together well to create a fun dance song.  \\"Fire Coming Out Of A Monkey's Head\\" features the great Dennis Hopper reading a strange, slightly disturbing story, and leads into the last two tracks which blend together to form a very spiritual ending to a great album.  Danger Mouse does a great job mixing it all together, and Albarn's vocals keep it connected and entertaining.
B000BYA5GO|4.0|In the first half an hour of the movie, I smirked and thought to myself, two things are for sure <br /> <br />1. Yuri's charasmatic brother will probably die (in slow motion) <br />2. Yuri's demise will be inevitable <br /> <br />At its core, Lord of war, provides a familiar story in character progression, Yuri begins and ends his journey in the same manner as a cocaine dealing 'Tony Montana' or 'Henry Hill'. Opertunistic and cunning at first, spinning out of control by midway and out of luck by the end.   <br /> <br />However, thats not what L.O.W. is really about. It turns into a fresh experience. The stakes are completely different and the moral grounds more frightening. Although Yuri isnt a violent man (more of a leech), his actions are more destructive, and more inhumane than any person you will see weilding a weapon... in any movie. He is completely detached from reality, oblivious to righteousness, and completely ignorant of his responsibilities. And when everyone around him is shooting each other, he is the ultimate sinner. For me, I guess that's one of the big messages, and in fact its a very informative movie into the gun trading business.  <br /> <br />          <br />
B000068PQ0|4.0|Yoshimi Battles the Pink Robots is a strange record.  The music is soft and pleasant while the lyrics are about evil robots coming to kill us all.  There are bizarre instrumental tracks with electronic beats and the noises of women screaming in the background.  The songs can sort of be described as electronic/pop/rock.  There's no reason it should work besides the fact that the Flaming Lips are a talented group of guys and know how to keep it more entertaining than silly, and so it does work. <br /> <br />\\"Fight Test\\" is an energetic opening that sets the tone for the rest of the album.  The first part of the title track is very pleasant, and is more strange goodness. \\"Yoshimi Battles the Pink Robots Pt. 2\\" has a nice groove to it, accompanied by the slightly unnerving shrieking.  \\"Are You A Hypnotist??\\" is a little more slower paced and is a nice song.  \\"Do You Realize??\\" is my favorite song with its enjoyable musicianship and high rising vocals.  \\"All We Have Is Now\\" is one of the more interesting songs lyrically, and the album is closed by another fun instrumental, \\"Approaching Pavonis Mons By Balloon (Utopia Planitia)\\". <br /> <br />I'm not in love with the Flaming Lips, but they've intrigued me enough to check out other albums by them.  Yoshimi Battles the Pink Robots is very enjoyably to listen to all the way through, it's just lacking that element that makes me really love it.
B0002Y69NG|4.0|James Saad wrote a review a while back about how it would've have been awesome if Brandon Lee had played Neo. Truth is, Lee was the Wachowski bros first choice for the part, but alas he passed away.  Neo was initially going have long hair (like Brandon had in the crow) as you can see in the comic like screen boards you can see in Matrix Revisited. Kinda adds to the Matrix curse people have elluded to (Aaliyah who was  supposed play either Niobe or Zee, died in a plane crash before Reloaded, Gloria Foster (Oracle) passing before Revolutions, Keanu Reeves almost fatal accident (neck injury), etc..)  You can find this info on Wikipedia.
B000ETQRCM|5.0|Pearl Jam (2006.), Pearl Jam's eighth studio album<br /><br />When it comes to looking at Pearl Jam's 16-year long existance as a band, you see a band which has a progressed in a totally unique and unusual way. In the early 90's, simply put, Pearl Jam were one of the biggest bands in the world. The band's first three albums, 'Ten', 'Vs.' and 'Vitalogy' were overnight multiplatinum successes. However, starting with 1996's 'No Code', the band made increasing moves in a much more uncommercial, experimental and underground direction. Many early fans of the band dropped off, unable to appreciate to changing direction the band was going in, leaving a much smaller base of dedicated fans to appreciate their later works. However, 2006 rolls around and the release of the band's first album in four years is announced. The album is rumoured to be one of the band's most complete efforts in a long time; suddenly more people, dare I say the mainstream are talking Pearl Jam and anticipating the new album. Is Pearl Jam back? Read on...<br /><br />Firstly, I personally believe that the band never went away in the first place. The band have produced some classic albums whilst being out of the spotlight and are still an extremely important musical entity. That aside, this new self-titled release blew me away from the first listen; again my favourite band haven't disappointed me with this release. Musically, this is no comeback for the band; that would suggest the band's last few albums were sub par however, you sense this album has a completeness and power to it that harks back to the Pearl Jam of the early 1990's - a sound which is bound to attract more listeners. However, with this more rocking and sometimes aggressive sound the band presents on the album, they make no compromises to their artistic vision. The album's sound is vintage Pearl Jam; it's definitely been worth waiting for. After just a few days of listening, the 'Avacado' album is already my 3rd favourite Pearl Jam album behind 'Ten' and 'Binaural' and may have chance to go higher with further listening. Put simply, all 13 songs on the album are incredibly strong and all hold up on their own - there's no filler. It's music like this that is keeping rock n' roll going strong.<br /><br />As far as individual performances go, Eddie Vedder's singing is some of his strongest in a long time. As usual, lyrically insightful, Vedder covers plenty of issues be it the recent Iraq war conflict, attacks on certain politicians (umm, I wonder who...!) and stuff like unemployment. As usual his vocals hit home very strongly and gives an impressive front to the album. Mike McCready is also very strong on this album. There's some classic sounding lead guitar work whether it be in the more aggressive songs (i.e. 'Life Wasted' or 'Comatose') or in the more slower gems (i.e. 'Unemployable' or 'Gone'). Also, not to go amiss is his lyrics to 'Inside Job', an impressive effort. Stone Gossard (guitar), Matt Cameron (drums) and Jeff Ament (bass) are all in great form also. The band sound more cohesive than they have done in a long time; this album is a true group effort. Combining the raw power and vitriol of the band's early albums and the emotive acoustics seen on albums like 'No Code', 'Vitalogy' or 'Riot Act', the band's sound is uniquely fresh sounding.<br /><br />'Pearl Jam' gets underway with hard hitting opener 'Life Wasted'. This has a vintage, memorable riff to it that will easily stick in your head. Vedder's vocal aggression is in full throttle throughout the song. McCready's blistering guitar exit has a bite to it not seen as often since the days of 'Vs.'. The well received single, 'World Wide Suicide' follows next. This is a fantastic song, who's release two months ago only made me anticipate this album more. Another great riff to this one, in a similar vein to 'Do The Evolution', Gossard and McCready's guitars are on fire throughout, as is the power in Vedder's vocals, casting his views on recent conflicts. The chorus is a classic. 'Comatose' is a short but very strong song. It has a very punkish elements to it, with lots of subtly varied rhythms and well placed aggression. 'Severed Hand' has a sonic intro before building into another strong guitar opening with some resonant drumming from Matt Cameron. Vedder's deep register vocal work very well with the tone of this song and the lyrics are great. The 'If I Don't Lose Control' bridge is particularly impressive and is followed by another great McCready solo. 'Marker In The Sand' is an equally strong song, with more great vocals and impressive guitar contrasts between acoustic and crunching electric in classic PJ style. Again, another strong chorus on this one.<br /><br />Following an awesome set of 5 guitar heavy, aggressive opening songs, the album fully ventures into acoustic territory with 'Parachutes'; afterall, where would a Pearl Jam album be without the acoustic ballads. This Gossard penned song is to this album what 'Thin Air' is to 'Binaural'. It has an interesting skipping acoustic riff over a very mello vocal performance from Vedder. At times the song has an almost Beatlesque feel to which works very well. 'Unemployable', the b-side to the 'World Wide Suicide' single, is next. Eddie Vedder tells the tale of a man who loses his job and the struggles that arise from it. The sound has a very chilled out, 'classic rock' feel to it, with great guitar melodies and catchy chorus, with Vedder's 'Uh-oh oh oh' chant. More aggressive, punkish styles return with 'Big Wave', complete with a rapid fire chorus and an intersting bridge later on in the song. With 'Gone', we have one of the album's finest songs. The quiet and acoustic opening sets the scene for an emotive vocal performance from Vedder. The introduction of wailing guitar is soul stirring before the song cleverly builds into full-out climax. This is Pearl Jam at their very best. Next, in true Pearl Jam tradition, we have the short track of the album in 'Wasted Reprise'. The weak point of the album, this song none the less puts a different slant on the album opener, with the inclusion of Boom Gaspar's organ (which for the record adds to the texture of a lot of the songs on the album). The guitar rock picks up again with 'Army Reserve', a song tributed to those serving in military conflict who are risking their lives. There's more classic PJ guitar work. 'Come Back' is a real gem of a song. It has a really soulful feel to it, with subtle toned down guitars, lots of organ and slow groove. Some people are calling this a song of 'Yellow Ledbetter' like proportions and I can see what they means. Vedder's lyrics and performance are the centrepiece to the song, with the 'Come Back' vocal exit being particularly strong. This song will definitely be a hit with the crowd at the PJ gigs in their up coming tour. Next, we have 'Inside Job' to close the album. Again, Pearl Jam close their album with an exceptional track, perhaps the best cut on here. This song is what 'Indifference' was to 'Vs.' or 'All Or None' to 'Riot Act'. A slow melodic song, extending out over 6 minutes with a chilling opening guitar melody setting the mood. Vedder's vocals, in tune to some great piano melody is very powerful, as are Jeff Aments bass fills. McCready's lyrics are excellent on this song. The strong exit to the song hits home very well. This song is pure emotion and genius; a fitting closure to what is a classic album.<br /><br />Pearl Jam is have been putting out great music for years and they're still here. With an effort like this one, they're going to be around for a lot longer. 'Pearl Jam' was well worth the wait; this is one of the finest, complete and cohesive efforts by the band and deserves all of the praise it has been given. All the 5* reviews on this site have got it spot on, this is a classic and is definitely the album of the year so far.<br /><br />MY RATING: 9/10classic. 'Comatose' is a short but very strong song.

0671027387|5.0|After reading The Da Vinci Code, I enjoyed so much Dan Brown's writing that I decided to give a try to another of his book. Deception Point looked interesting to me because of the NASA / politic conspiracy theme I had never seen before. The novel is quite different from the DVC and \\"Angels & Demons\\", two books featuring Robert Langdon as the main character and art, symbology and riddles as main topics.<br /><br />After only 3 chapters, I had a hard time trying to put it down. The intrigue is fascinating and well-built, the characters are not numerous but complete and well developed as the story gets more complex. A few parts of the intrigue are predictable but the global development is great and full of surprises.<br /><br />With this book, Brown proves he is an intelligent and dynamic author with a great sense of perfection (he did plenty of researches to expose the numerous technologies presented in his book). Great intrigue, great pace, a good novel for occasional and fanatic readers !

The sound has a very chilled out, 'classic rock' feel to it, with great guitar melodies and catchy chorus, with Vedder's 'Uh-oh oh oh' chant. More aggressive, punkish styles return with 'Big Wave', complete with a rapid fire chorus and an intersting bridge later on in the song. With 'Gone', we have one of the album's finest songs. The quiet and acoustic opening sets the scene for an emotive vocal performance from Vedder. The introduction of wailing guitar is soul stirring before the song cleverly builds into full-out climax. This is Pearl Jam at their very best. Next, in true Pearl Jam tradition, we have the short track of the album in 'Wasted Reprise'. The weak point ofthe album, this song none the less puts a different slant on the album opener, with the inclusion of Boom Gaspar's organ (which for the record adds to the texture of a lot of the songs on the album). The guitar rock picks up again with 'Army Reserve', a song tributed to those serving in military conflict who are risking their lives. There's more classic PJ guitar work. 'Come Back' is a real gem of a song. It has a really soulful feel to it, with subtle toned down guitars, lots of organ and slow groove. Some people are calling this a song of 'Yellow Ledbetter' like proportions and I can see what they means. Vedder's lyrics and performance are the centrepiece to the song, with the 'Come Back' vocal exit being particularly strong. This song will definitely be a hit with the crowd at the PJ gigs in their up coming tour. Next, we have 'Inside Job' to close the album. Again, Pearl Jam close their album with an exceptional track, perhaps the best cut on here. This song is what 'Indifference' was to 'Vs.' or 'All Or None' to 'Riot Act'. A slow melodic song, extending out over 6 minutes with a chilling opening guitar melody setting the mood. Vedder's vocals, in tune to some great piano melody is very powerful, as are Jeff Aments bass fills. McCready's lyrics are excellent on this song. The strong exit to the song hits home very well. This song is pure emotion and genius; a fitting closure to what is a classic album.    Pearl Jam is have been putting out great music for years and they're still here. With an effort like this one, they're going to be around for a lot longer. 'Pearl Jam' was well worth the wait; this is one of the finest, complete and cohesive efforts by the band and deserves all of the praise it has been given. All the 5* reviews on this site have got it spot on, this is a classic and is definitely the album of the year so far.    MY RATING: 9/10
B000009QPE|3.0|I'm gonna make this short and simple...<br /><br />Reign in Blood CAN be ranked alongside thrash greats like Master of Puppets and Rust in Peace, but I won't. If you could take out all vocals from the entire album, THEN I might...
B000E97Y6K|5.0|Director Peter Jackson's epic King Kong is a masterpiece. Yes this movie is 3 hours in length but it is worth your time and patience. I saw it in the movie theatre and was very impressed by this classic tale. Naomi Watts is brilliant and cute as Ann Darow She is good in every role she is in, such a talented actress! The movie is a bit slow in the beginning but by the time King Kong arrives on screen, the action quickly picks up and never stops til the end. Great cinematography and art direction. I am not much for action movies but this is the best one I have ever seen. Big kudos to the cast and director, I give you Kong!!
B000F0UV0E|5.0|I've been a big fan of Knopfler for a long time now, I was intrigued when I heard about his collabaration with Harris, and I am no fan of country actually, but this album has proved to be very special, a very personal album for both musicians on many levels, I thoroughly enjoyed all songs, especially the title song, a beautiful song laying bare the insecurities of an artist, and we truly appreciate all your roadrunning MK & EH.
B00000AFFI|4.0|Is This Desire? by P.J. Harvey is such a haunting and strange album. I like it though because the songs are not silly or pretentious, Harvey never tries to be somebody she is not. She is a real artist who likes doing her own thing and I respect that. Standout tracks include: The Sky lit up, The Wind, The River, No girl so sweet, Catherine, A perfect day Elise, and my personal fave, Angelene. That song is so good, \\"I've seen men come and go but there will be one to collect my soul and come to me, 2 thousand miles away, he walks upon the coast, 2 thousand miles away it lays open like a road...\\" The River is sweetly mellow and sad, \\"Two silent birds circled by like our pain in the river...\\" But unfortantely some of the tracks are less than average, but Is This Desire? is a great album just not one of my all-time favorites, I prefer Dry and Stories from the city, stories from the sea. If you are just discovering P.J. Harvey then I recommend all her albums to see which one is your favorite. Enjoy!
1400079179|5.0|This book is a work of fiction.  My aunt called it anti-Christian and the whole controversy surrounding this book is absolutely ridiculous.  I read the book before learning about the controversy about it.  I did this on purpose.  This book is a work of fiction not something to contemplate your faith on.  The theories proposed in this book do make you think.  I am Catholic and I find it very interesting to read anything having to deal with religion.  If anyone would have a religious objection to this Work of FICTION...then it might be that it dosn't look fondly on the Catholic Church at times and talks about pagan religion.  It brings in many religions.  Regarding the unfondness towards the church, many Catholics I know don't always look upon the Vaticans rules as totally acceptable.<br /><br />Beyond this is was an excellent book.  It does require a good amount of thinking to keep up with the plot in points.  If you like a book that makes you think and sucks you in until the very last page you'll love this book.  I suggest reading the book before you see the movie because I'm told the movie might be quite different than the book.  Remember, don't take this book as some kind of controversial document.  It's a GREAT work of fiction.
B0006SSOHC|5.0|Two men, Leigh Whannell and James Wan, obviously had a lot of time on their hands when creating the now breakthrough film that redefined what Horror really is; \\"Saw\\".<br /><br />The story goes about when two strangers find themselves trapped in a mysterious room chained from the leg to the wall.<br /><br />Now, for a plot as simple as that, the creativity has room to grow and even to pulsate with ingenious gimmicks and clever plot twists.<br /><br />What I really enjoyed about this movie is the fact that it started out dark and began to open up more, almost like it was giving birth to the new creative side of franchise horror, introducing you to the new baddie that will take the place of Freddie Kruger, Jason Vorhees, and the Seven Killer. In fact, one would say that the tone of the movie has a slighly \\"Se7enish feel.\\"<br /><br />The good part is that that doesn't take away from the excitement or the suspense. Along the way, the film educates you on the one holding them hostage and his method of killing. The Killer, apparently called Jigsaw, wants the victim's to figure out the puzzles of the death game that he has created. There are several ways to escape but all of them are either preconceived or pre-thout out ahead of time in where the chances of survival and escaping are both on a very jagged plane.<br /><br />I'd say that this movie finally captures what every other director was trying to do with modern day Horror. I'll go one step further and say that this movie Re-invented the Horror franchise. And, for a first try, debut film, these two filmakers really raise the bar higher than ever anticipated.<br /><br />I highly reccomend this film if you are a hardcore horror/thriller fan but also want the thinking that goes along with it, as with the Movie Seven.<br /><br />I saw this movie when it first came out around Halloween and let me tell you that this Franchise did something Newer, Bolder, and that they have invented a new Franchise for the Horror fans in need. You ABSOLUTELY HAVE TO WATCH THIS FILM!!!<br /><br />IT'S GREAT!!!!<br /><br />I GIVE IT TEN STARS!!!!!!You ABSOLUTELY HAVE TO WATCH THIS FILM!!!<br /><br />IT'S GREAT!!!!<br /><br />I GIVE IT TEN STARS!!!!!!
B00003CX5P|2.0|Kids willl love everything about this movie: Jar Jar, the semi-interesting villian Darth Maul, the lightsabers, the podrace. They might not get the unneccesarily complicated plot, but they won't care either. Adults and teens will be forced to take a different view. <br /> <br />The greatest thing that can be said for this movie is that it's usually fun to look at. Take the podrace sequence, for example. It's extremely realistic, especially for it's time. <br /> <br />Then it drags on for twenty minutes. That's just too much, especially when the average race feels long at five minutes, in a movie. <br /> <br />Unfortunately, most of the acting is terrible as well. Ewan McGregor is the most talented moment of the cast, but he barely does anything. The main problem with the acting is actually the dialogue. Liam Neeson might be good if we could except that normal people actually said truly bizarre things like the stuff coming out of his mouth. But we can't, and the don't. <br /> <br />Then there's Jar Jar. Oh, Jar Jar. Possibly the most despised character in reccent years, including villians. This character makes fart jokes. Yes, my friends, you heard me correctly: Star Wars now has fart jokes. <br /> <br />However, visually and in terms of special effects, this is a revolutionary movie. The planet of Naboo features some of the most beautiful scenes, and an underwater sequence is especially spectacular. The lightsaber fights are fun, but unfortunately it's impossible to care about the villian too much--he's no Darth Vader. Speaking of which, it's hard to believe that little Jake Lloyd's Anakin, who jumps aroud saying \\"Yippee!\\" and \\"Mom, you said most of the problems in the galaxy are cause people don't help each other\\" will really grow up to be the most loved-hated villian ever? Because I don't. <br /> <br />If all you want is visual spectacle, or something that can be watched on really boring evenings with a bowl of popcorn, buy this. If you're new to SW, stick with the Empire Strikes back, or just go with something more substantial than the unfortunate mess that is \\"The Phantom Menace.\\"
B000EJ9MTW|3.0|I read a blurb on Wolfmother in Rolling Stone recently, so I thought I'd check out the CD on Amazon.   I've listened to all the track previews and couldn't decide whether I should purchase this CD, so I read all the reviews and then re-listened to the previews.  Still couldn't decide, as the impression I got was one of somewhat weak and somewhat Ozzy-like vocals and \\"thin\\" guitar.   So I wondered, \\"Is this just because I'm only listening to 15sec clips?\\"   To be fare, I pulled up Black Sabbath\'s Paranoid and Deep Purple's In Rock (both of the heaviest of heavy metal ever) as well as the Living Things' Ahead of the Lions (my favorite new band).   Well, Wolfmother stills seems weak to me.    So what's a poor boy to do?    Well, a week later I found the CD on sale at Best Buy, so I partook.  Confirming my fears, I found a band with Ozzy-like vocals, some Shades of Deep Purple-era organ, some nice rhythms and cool chord changes.   I remain, however, still in search of a guitar solo...which would truly make this a 70's era band.   Without this addition, I think the music will exist only as background music.    I just don't hear what all the bandwagon folks are talking about....Jack White plays occasional solos, Wolfmother is a Wolfchild without any.
B000EULJLU|5.0|All I can say is that the price I paid for this cd was worth it just for the title track, which is in my opinion one of the greatest songs Tool have ever put out. The \\"song\\" 10,000 days is epic, atmospheric and soo subtle in it's power. The rest of the cd is also very good and was well worth the wait. Forget all the bad reviews and just go buy it.
B000EULJLU|5.0|I'll try not to reinstate other reviews. The difference between this tool album and previous ones is there are a few tracks here that are weak (in the conventional sense) by Tool's standards. Where every song in Lateralus and Aenima is a completely brilliant rocking entity in itself, the musical meat of this album is watered down more amongst sprawling atmosphere; although in this respect this is probably Tool's most cohesive album. Subjectively, Tool are exploring new moods and song structures (the album is brooding and dark compared to the positive spiritual lyrics of Lateralus), with more extended and meandering songs, which take more patience than previous Tool, but which are incredibly rewarding to listen to over and over. In this respect 10,000 days has a depth that other albums didn't. Objectively though, the composition techniques are really just the old Tool formula, but I guess that's what makes Tool Tool! They are just reinstated their formula with a whole new inspiration.     I can't decide if this is as good as Tool's other albums. It certainly has to be listened to as one whole album, you couldn't play it on shuffle, or analyse individual minutes of it by their self, in which case one would conclude there are many weak moments. In this respect, we can commend Tool for exploring new paths, although fans of more conventional rock and metal may be disappointed. This album needs to be listened to in a new way; when you're in the right frame of mind it'll spring at you and you'll be bowled over! Tool are the enigmatic geniuses of rock!    My favourite songs are 10,000 days, the Pot, Right in Two, and they are still growing on me! My least favourite are Jambi and Rosetta Stoned, which both seem generic and uninspired, although the latter is kind of the sequel to Faaip De Oaid ;)
076790592X|5.0|This book is a must read! It is a moving book that will remind you of what is important in life.  It is a quick read that is well written and worth a few hours of your time.  I think you will find the book to be inspiring, funny, hopeful, sad and uplifting.  Read it, you will not regret it!
B000002KGT|5.0|Every single song is a hit in my opinion. One of those enduring classics and a must have for any rock fan.  Stevie Nicks has an incredible voice.  My faves are The Chain and Never Going Back Again.
0140067477|5.0|I've always loved Winnie the Pooh, ...so I browsed around in the book store and ran across this book.  When I opened it, I couldn't put it down.  Who would have ever thought that inside a sweet children's story could be so much depth? Benjamin Hoff is a genious.  He takes me down a river of patient thought.  You'll love this, no matter where you are in life.  A \\"have to read it at least once\\" book.
B000EULJLU|4.0|My first review I said I was bored with this album, but that was only a week after it came out.  It gets better.  Wings for Marie part 2 is amazing.  Vicarious is obviously great.  I would put it up there with all the other tool albums as simply amazing, but now I just want to know: when's the next Tool album?
B0006L16N8|5.0|this is the best a,bum ever. if any1 ever says that this is not good, like the stupid metal people, then they should burn. this is a great album and coldplay is very very talented. the guitar work is great and the singer has a great voice. even the drumming is above average.<br /><br />if you love great music, get coldplays 2004 CD \\"x & y\\"
B000EULJLU|5.0|Buy and listen! <br />Am I the only one that thinks of GOP and Bush when listening to Wings part 2?
B000002MP2|4.0|this is almost as good as american idiot. green day and the hottie billie joe have been around since forever and they know how to make gret punk music. still nothing beats the legendary american idiot because that album is the greatest album of all time behind coldplay and kanye. this is more like real punk than the new pop-punk greenday. and for everyone who hates green day i think you shuld all go burn in hell for that they are the most innovative, greatest band of all-time and the metal and rock ppl should just go back to slitting there wrists, sacrificing themselves to iron maiden and listen to that decide crap/<br /><br />get everything by greenday, like american idiot and nimrod and dookie.<br /><br />DOokie is great. pEaCe OuT.
B000EULJLU|5.0|Okay first off let me start by saying that Mr Censored doesn't know what he's talking about.  Cheap artwork in the album, are you kidding?!?!!?  The album comes with stereoscopic lenses built into it, so you can look at the pictures inside and they all become 3d.  Several Alex Grey psychadelic freakout pictures, and also (gasp!) pictures of the band members, surrounded by weird things.  I would pay 20 bucks for just the artwork, the cd is a bonus. <br /> <br />Now for the music.  There are only a few reasons you could not like this cd.  1 - you're a pop devouring simpleton and can't understand any music that doesn't involve 3 chords and a 4/4 beat.  2 - You're 15 years old and say omg!  I wanted this cd to be more heavy like meshuggah!  This isn't as heavy as Atreyu!  3 - You don't like music. <br /> <br />Is this cd heavy?  That would depend on your definition.  If you want head banging power chords you'll find them.  If you practice hard you might be able to play air guitar to Jambi, but don't count on it.  It's a natural progression from Lateralus, yet it has shades of all their previous work.  You'll catch hints of H., Prison Sex, and others.  Dense, swirling soundscapes shift to heavy, driving rhythms that leave you completely satisfied. <br /> <br />This album is definitely a slow burner, with the exception of The Pot, which is the most straight ahead rocker of the bunch.  Just like Lateralus it will take awhile to grow on you, just keep listening.  I wasn't really impressed initially, but now I can't take it out. <br /> <br />So don't listen to the feeble-minded, or the 15 year old Atreyu fans that say this album sucks.  Especially don't listen to Mr Censored who says the artwork is cheap.  He's either missing an eye, or burned the cd off the internet. <br /> <br />Plus, Jambi is about the genie from Pee-Wee's Playhouse.  How can you go wrong with solid subject matter like that??
B000EULJLU|5.0|I cannot write a review comparing this album to any other Tool record because I have no favorite album by this band. Each release is unique and incredible in its own way. This one is no exception. I am, however, glad that I spent a few days with it before writing this review, because, much like Tool's other records, it is not possible to digest the whole thing on the first or even the second listen. <br /> <br />This is probably Tool's most complex album. The quieter and more reflective moments definitely make the heavier songs such as Vicarious or The Pot stand out all the more. The two song suites:Wings For Marie parts 1 and 2 and Lost Keys/Rosetta Stoned are the absolute highlights. Wings is probably, lyrically and musically, the most moving piece of music Tool has ever produced.  <br /> <br />Some of the complaints I have read from other reviewers, both on this site and elsewhere, have said that the album may be too long or that there are only 4 or so \\"real \\" songs. However, the only tracks that are not actually \\"songs\\" are Vigenti Tres and Lippan Conjuring. Overall Aenima, which some of these reviewers claim as their favorite has more non-song tracks, and Aenima and Lateralus are both longer (by approximately 2 and 3 minutes respectively.) <br /> <br />So in the end, we have a new album that should be appreciated by anyone who has the patience to allow it to take the listener where it wants to go. Tool has been my favorite band since Undertow came out in 1993 (I was 23). The fact that they are still my favorite band at 35 says a lot, since your tastes inevetably change a bit as you get older. This band, however, has never let me down.  <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
1400079179|4.0|Great story, very entertaining.  I could not put this book down, it really sucks you in till the end.
B000EULJLU|5.0|This album is perfection. For everyone who rated and reviewd the album below its highest amount offered, you obviously do not understand the album or its content. You are better off continueing your routine of listening to the mindless, catchy,[...] you call music. Each member of Tool displays their artistic talent and point of view superbly.
0671027387|4.0|I am usualy a romance reader and needed a change, this book was a great choice.  The story is very interesting that keeps you turning the pages. I really liked the characters and the plot was unusually different, which was also a nice change.
B000002G8L|4.0|Eric Clapton has always been involved in the blues, even before joining the Yardbirds in 1963.  From time to time Clapton's music has strayed into other areas, including pop, but blues has always been an integral part of his music.  This two-CD live album focuses on blues-oriented music.<br /><br />Much of the music is slow and easy, but some of it is electrifyingly fast.  Clapton performs several of his biggest hits, including \\"Lay Down Sally,\\" \\"Wonderful Tonight\\" and \\"Cocaine.\\"<br /><br />Clapton plays the blues especially well on several of these songs.  \\"Worried Life Blues\\" is very well done and is performed as well as any blues I have heard.  This CD allows this song to extend for eight and a half wonderful minutes.  Other extended blues songs include Otis Rush's \\"Double Trouble\\" and the mellow song \\"Rambling on My Mind.\\"<br /><br />Perhaps the fastest song on this two CD set, or at least the most powered, is the song \\"Blues Power,\\" where the vocals are powered along by guitars and piano.  \\"Cocaine\\" is almost as powerful with a strong guitar track.  The audience gets into this song with claps and providing an occasional \\"cocaine\\" in the background.  The lead guitar in this song does a nice job of wailing in places.<br /><br />Clapton also takes on songs by others such as Don William's \\"Tulsa Time.\\"  Clapton sings a song he made famous, J.J. Cale's \\"After Midnight.\\"<br /><br />The second CD closes with the bouncy rock and roll song \\"Further on Up the Road.\\" This song left me wanting more, and shows that someone was thinking when they ended this CD with this song.<br /><br />Eric Clapton has always proven that he is a master performer, entering his fifth decade of professional music.  This collection originally recorded in 1980 is nicely representative of Eric Clapton the blues man, and fans of the blues and of Eric Clapton should have this one in their collection.  Enjoy!
B000F3AB0Q|5.0|<br />Gary Moore!  What a wonderful new album from this incredible musician! <br /> <br />His singing has continued to get better, either from coaching, practice, age, or some combination.  This is a really well-sung album.  And of course, his playing is just always spot-on and so highly fired-up. <br /> <br />He has continued to build his talent and energy as a guitarist! ... and that amazing driving fire that underlies everything is just as complete as ever.  He pours his full personality into this music. <br /> <br />You might think that Gary \\"jams\\" lots of his playing.  However, if you go back and listen to any of the cuts off of \\"Still Got The Blues\\", for example, and then find live versions of the same cuts, you will quickly see that he leaves nothing to chance.  His composition is planned in detail, but the execution is still so entirely inspired that it comes out as spontaneous jam - the best of both worlds.   <br /> <br />Gary uses a horn section on a couple of songs to great effect and I like the range of tones, such as the semi-clean leads on the remake of Midnight Blues (2006).  Gonna Rain Today is flat-out beautiful. <br /> <br />To me, Gary is the most meaningful blues/rock player of all time.  He did it with great talent, discipline and lots of focused work.  This album continues fully in his track record of excellent, beautiful art. <br /> <br />Gary, if you ever read amazon reviews, man, you did it again.  This album is just a treasure and I'm just grateful you made another one! <br /> <br />
B000CS45QU|5.0|Beth Orton has a quality to her music that is not always immediately apparent upon first listening.  Her songs, if given the chance, get inside of you and almost always find a permenant place there.  Her voice, both in her vocal delivery and in her lyrics, have a beautiful, incomparable quality, wonderfully musical and poetic, if often difficult to understand -- obviously, deeply personal, yet ambiguous enough that the listener (as with any great art) can find their own personal meaning therewithin. <br /> <br />With this album, \\"The Comfort of Strangers\\", Beth Orton brings her acoustic sensibilities, so prevalent from her live perfomances, more fully into the studio, creating her softest and most hauntingly beautiful album to date.  I will leave it to others to expound on each particular track, but I would be remiss if I didn't point out that the \\"Limited Edition\\" disk contains (among others) two of the most beauiful songs ever recorded by any artist:  \\"What We Begin\\", and \\"On My Way Home\\" -- each of which, like many of Ms. Orton's songs, draws you back time and again almost like an addiction you can't live without. <br /> <br />Of all the little-known performers I've stumbled across in my years of musical exploration, Beth Orton has been, and remains, an absolute favorite.
0765315246|4.0|Old Man's War has been nominated for this year's Best Novel Hugo. I think it's fair to say that it's the one novel on the shortlist that makes you say \\"Where did that come from?\\". Having read it, well, I still kind of say that. I don't think it's worthy of a Hugo. But it's not bad at all -- it's an always entertaining book, very Heinleinian in tone, with some neat ideas, and some silly ones. It would be unfair to criticize it for being less than worthy of a Hugo -- treated rather as a promising first novel, one can only say \\"It was fun, and I'll be looking for more by the same author.\\" (But it won't be first, or even fourth, on my Hugo ballot.) <br /> <br />The book opens with 75 year old John Perry enlisting in the Colonial Defence Forces. It seems that when you are 65 you get an offer to sign up for the CDF in ten years. John and his wife signed up, but his wife has since died. Rumor has it that CDF members get life-extension treatments, which is what makes the offer interesting, even for an old war-protester like John. <br /> <br />The CDF is the space arm of humanity's military. It seems that Earth has colonized many planets, though only with geographically disadvantaged people. Unfortunately, most alien species seem to have the attitude \\"Shoot first and ask questions later\\" vis-a-vis other species. Which makes a CDF necessary. To be sure, one might ask (and the book does ask, but not very deeply) \\"Aren't humans guilty of the same attitude?\\" <br /> <br />Anyway, Americans cannot be colonists, but they can join the CDF. After ten years in the military, a veteran can become a colonist. <br /> <br />So John joins, and gets his new body, and has some great sex with it, and learns to be a soldier. The rest of the novel follows his military adventures. Which are fairly well-depicted, with a couple caveats. (The battle against the inch-high people frankly destroyed my Willing Suspension of Disbelief.) At the end an interesting, though not exactly, in my opinion, logical, wrinkle is added. Along with a strange and very powerful alien race. <br /> <br />So: is it fun? Yes. Is it a quick read? Yes. Does it have some nice ideas? Yes. On the other hand, does it have some silly ideas? Yes. Is the morality of the whole war thing given short shrift? Yes -- though it's not entirely glossed over, to be fair. Is the structure a bit slack? Yes. In the end -- a good first novel, worth a look. Not brilliant. But I'll read Scalzi's next couple of books to see how he develops. <br />
0684824906|5.0|This book is not short, and it is not a particularly easy read; but I love it.  One of the best ways to learn about anything is to study the actions and behaviors of someone who is exemplary at that skill.  Abraham Lincoln was an exemplary leader in many ways, and in this book you will gain many insights into his approach to leadership.<br /><br />This book takes you far beyond the things you may have read or learned about Lincoln in the past.  For example, did you realize that his Cabinet was made up of those who were his challengers for the Republican nomination and members of the opposing party, and that many of this group didn't agree with him on major issues?  From those facts alone I hope you can surmise that there are many lessons about building teams and consensus in these pages.<br /><br />If you like history, especially American history this book will fascinate you.  I recommend it for more pragmatic reasons. Read this book to apply the lessons and approaches of Lincoln to your own leadership challenges.
B00009W0WM|5.0|Many have tried to remake or duplicate Casablanca.  None have succeeded.  It's not hard to understand why either.  How can you remake one of, if not arguably, the best motion picture film of all time?  The answer is simple: you can't.<br /><br />One of the enigmas that makes this film such an incredible feat, is that throughout most of its production, the story wasn't finished.  They had no idea how it was going to end.  Does Ilsa stay with Rick?  Does she go with Lazlo?  And yet, they obviously found a way to tie the whole story together.<br /><br />I simply cannot think of anyone else to play the part of Rick Blaine, or Ingrid Bergman as Ilsa,  or Claude Rains as Capt. Renault.<br /><br />Eveyone knows the story of Rick Blaine, an embittered saloon keeper who never understood why the love of his life, Ilsa Lund, left him high and dry in Paris just before the German invasion.  He's found his entire idealistic world has been turned upside down.  He claims to care about no one and nothing.  \\"I stick my neck out for nobody!\\"  We quickly find out that those feelings of love and fighting for justice have never left, but have simply been buried beneath anger and feelings of mistrust.  Is this ever more apparent during one of the film's most touching scenes, when Rick saves the virtue of the young Bulgarian wife who feels their only chance at leaving Casablanca may be for her to sleep with Capt. Renault in order to secure a visa.  Rick's entire staff goes nuts at this beautiful gesture, which Rick dismisses as a simple gesture to love.<br /><br />It really is fun to watch this film for the first time to see how Rick helps Ilsa and Lazlo.  At first, we are led to believe that he's planning to be selfish and take Ilsa back.<br /><br />Humphrey Bogart is nothing short of magnificent.  He embodies one of the most memorable characters in film history.  We see him in the white coat and black bow tie, running his club with a simple coolness.  Bogart made the trenchcoat and hat a signature outfit as well, not only in Casablanca, but in such films as The Big Sleep and The Maltese Falcon.  He is one of my favorite actors of all time, and Casablanca is probably my favorite role, although it's very difficult to decide which is best out of all of his great portrayals.  Entertainment Weekly had him listed as the best actor of all time and the most entertaining.  It's difficult to argue against this.<br /><br />Ingrid Bergman.  MGM made the right move in negotiating for Ingrid, as she was under contract with David O Selznick.  No one else could have played the part of Ilsa.  Bergman is my favorite actress of all time.  She brings such passion and ease to her roles, and yet she plays Ilsa with a calm, cool sense until she realizes she can no longer deny her feelings for Rick.  She loves Lazlo too, which is obvious, but for different reasons.  Lazlo represents the figure battling for justice and a restoration of a broken world back to what it was.  He inspires Ilsa.  However, nobody has brought out a passion or resevoir of feelings from her than Rick.  We know that Lazlo is often occupied, as what he's fighting for is bigger than himself or even Ilsa.  Rick was once like Lazlo, but Rick devotes his feelings to Ilsa, something that she's never known before.  And ironcially, it is Rick who commits the most selfless act, the most loving act in the end.<br /><br />Claude Rains is one of my favorite character actors.  He's simply wonderful.  He can play any part you put in front of him.  He plays Captain Renault with charm and a man who tries in vain to be neutral, but it is obvious he isn't.  Just look at Renault during his talk with Major Strasser.  As Strasser points out that occupied French territories are \\"honey-combed with traitors.\\" You catch a glimpse of Renault who is not happy with that remark.  You also catch a glimpse of this during the film's most powerful moment: when Lazlo asks Rick's band to play the Les Marseillaise to drown out Strasserand the Germans as they sing the anthem of the Third Reich. That moment in the film when Les Marseillaise is played is one of the most powerful in all of film history.  It still gives me goose bumps when it is played in the film.<br /><br />Casablanca is simply timeless.  This is, as Lauren Bacall states during the documentary feature, the true definition of a classic.  AFI rated Casablanca as the second best film of all time.  I, personally, put it at the top.  It is more compelling than Citizen Kane, in my opinion.  Everyone remembers Rick and you often find yourself visiting Rick's Cafe Americain over and over with repeated viewings, because you simply never get tired of watching Casablanca.  At least, I don't.Third Reich. That moment in the film when Les Marseillaise is played is one of the most powerful in all of film history.

B0000DYJM6|5.0|Like any expert in their field, trials and tribulations are natural for evolving.  Pearl Jam jumped into our faces, said they were here for the long haul, and gave everyone the middle finger in the modern \\"ship-sinking-iceberg-filled\\" world of egos and icons and backstabbing bullsh*@t riddled two-faced wannabees.  These boys have put their heart and soul into everything they have done, and deserve nothing less then a life of peace and happiness.  These B-sides and more prove they are craftsmen and wizards stirring a pot filled with inspiration and love.  Listen and behold a love of life in the making.
B00003CXAA|2.0|So, a bunch of mafia gangsters come over and shoot each other up, then they go out west and shoot each other up there, including one particular scene in which a bunch of people all get shot up together as part of a sort of montage. Woo hoo. How brilliant. I'll never forget this movie. NOT.

630522577X|3.0|Why is this the dumbest movie on the block? Well, because it's just dumb. The notion of Eliza Doolittle's father, who is a drunk, at one point going off and marrying is a sad occasion. This man has no conception of fidelity. The only reason they are getting married is because now they have money. He will cheat and with just a little bit of blooming luck he wont get caught. In sum this movie sucks.
0743201140|4.0|A well written book about the need to capitalize on strengths rather than constantly trying to improve on weak areas. I must admit that the theme finder is rather effective and is a good take if you are confused about what you can do best in life. <br /> <br />However the book does not cover a mapping of the various themes to the roles that individuals can assume. Missing this vital aspect is a major short coming of the book. <br /> <br />May be the authors want you to think for yourself !  <br /> <br />Overall a good read.
B000ASDFEU|2.0|Did Patton make this movie? Because it seems like it was done as a hatchet job against Richard Montgomery and the great people of Great Britain and Ireland. I love how they turned an operation that was 90% successful into a defeat. The anti-British racism in this movie is disgusting. The Germans are portrayed as great heros fighting against all odds stopping Market Garden. Montgomery is portrayed as the blundering fool. Watch this movie if you get WWII mixed up with the American revolutionary war.
B000002NZO|5.0|The production is simple, the guitar sounds muted, the lyrics are somehow pedestrian, it is not the classic Genesis lineup, all these it's true but none matters because the music is absolutely masterful! Songs like Stagnation and Dusk are among the most beautiful compositions done in any music genre, ever. You listen to this and you are transported to another space and time, it is the musical equivalent to Hermann Hesse's 'Strange News from Another Star'.  Genesis may have more mature and better produced albums, but this one shows the band's main essence in it's most pure and primordial form and stands as a lonely, unique and unacknowledged masterpiece in their catalog.
B0002J4ZWS|3.0|I have to admit, I loved the idea of 'The Shawshank Redemption' ... an innocent man convicted by the evil fascist state of a murder he didn't commit, even though overwhelming evidence places him at the murder scene. What's more prison is a wonderful communist paradise where all the felons are perfect angels and martyrs of the state. That's perfectly wonderful. What I couldn't stand however was the worship of individual determination of perseverance that was idolized in this Hollywood tripe. That main character guy was terrible. Didn't you just wish the sewer rats had gotten to him? I know I did!
B000001EAQ|5.0|I remember vividly when I saw for the first time the video of 'Discoteche' and thought: 'What the hell is this? U2?', then I listened this same song and the rest of the album at a party, and inmediately loved it. For the common, U2 is just With or Without You, One and all the bunch of hits. For the real music lover and melomaniac, Pop is like the Holy Grail, just like another reviewer suggested. This album takes U2 to the extreme, where no boundaries exist. Discoteche, Mofo, Gone, Staring at the Sun, Do you feel Loved are fantastic pieces, all the songs in this album shows the musical genius that the band had (except maybe, If God will send its Angels, a standard tune to please the common). Even Miami, which is severely critized by 'professional' critics, is unique in the U2 the catalog of songs.   It is a shame that the band disqualify this album's music as a bad step, when the truth is that it is their last work where U2 showed its greatness, what came after is just competent music that follows a simple selling formula. I guess the band is now only interested in selling themselves to the masses even if they compromise  their musicianship and creativity.  I recommend also their Passengers project with Brian Eno, they go even further. I miss that U2 and must say that all my fellow melomaniac friends also do.
0688170528|5.0|Jodi Picoult tells more than a love story in this book. \\"The Pact\\" is an eager unravelling of a relationship and of a love unlike any other. Emily is shot on the first page and subconciously leaves behind a chain of unanswered questions, doubts and lies. Through a series of police investigations, Chris interprets their story, painting a moving story of a \\"suicide pact\\" between them. Yet in the end, a different story is told. It evolves into a truth no heart could fully know; it is really, an unfathomable truth of love.
B000AADYRQ|5.0|This is a great album from Deathcab, featuring some of what I think is their best work. I love all the songs, and they are all well done. Some of my favorites are, Soul Meets Body, a song i have played over and over and never tire of, I will follow you into the dark a tear inducing ballad, what sarah said another great song with a beautiful piano solo, crooked teeth a catchy tune I play over and over, and summer skin a wonderful song that gets better everytime you listen to it.
B0007GAERG|5.0|In recent times Mariah Carey has been harshly singled out, particulary by gutter press, about her music and even worse printing detailed stories about her personal life. Whether these stories are true or not is irrelevant, by being a superstar singer does she really deserve to have her life or lies whatever it is dragged through the papers. Mariah has a certain responsibility as a role model to people that look up to her and in my opinion she fulfils it admirably with style and class. I have witnessed on many an occasion after interviews, the way she treats fans with respect standing there signing autographs. Now we have set the record sort of straight let us talk about all that we care about Mariah and her amazing music career. The biggest selling artist of the 90's a Blue Chip award for receiving over a 100 certifications for her releases. This album has everything that is good about Mariah musically. The album opens with her urban chart monster \\"It's Like That\\", personally not my favourite cut on the album but it served a purpose and done that job admirably. \\"We Belong Together\\" follows next a superbly written, produced and vocalled smooth as silk swayer that is so made for Mariah it is a joke. \\"Shake It Off\\" is more mid-beat but just as strong. Mariah joins forces with the oh so talented James Poyser on the sublime silky smooth \\"Mine Again\\". Mariah rejoins with Snoop on \\"Say Somethin'\\" as solid as they come solid radio friendly R&B track. The producer that can do no wrong Kanye West produces the best mid- beat cut on the album \\"Stay The Night\\" sampling \\"Betcha By Golly Wow\\" to it's maximum potential. But if I had to pick a track on this album that summed up why you should by it, is the breath taking \\"Circles\\" absolutely phenomenal. This is Mariah at her breath taking vocal best other a smooth as silk backing. \\"Your Girl\\" is so retro its sick largely due to its sample use of \\"A Life With You\\" recorded by Adeaze. This solid track really shows Mariah's passion for ol' school soul. The slick and silky smoothed out \\"I Wish You Know\\" adds even more class to this album, if that's possible. Clubwise there is no finer cut on this album than the Neptunes produced and Nelly featured \\"To The Floor\\". The chants, near marching snare drums and Pharells vocals added to Mariah at her seductive vocal best all add to this masterpiece that should have been and was going to be at one point the first single lifted from the album. Whoever changed their mind should have been sacked. The icing on the cake on this album comes via the stunning \\"Fly Like A Bird\\".

B000EJ9MTW|5.0|This may be the best album of 2006. I bought this CD along with two others last tuesday. I have'nt even opened the other two yet. These guys deserve a big audience. Zeppelin, Black Sabbath, The White Stripes, Dare I say STYX.... All wrapped up in one. The sound is old and new at the same time.... I think if the kids want to hear what real rock and roll should sound like they need to buy this CD. It is a really refreshing sound and I hope some other bands take note.
B00082IJ08|5.0|The first album from the Gorillaz collective since their 2001 eponymous debut - if you ignore the rather good remix album that came out a couple of months later - Demon Days springs a few surprises, as one might expect.<br /><br />Away from his more regular gig as Blur frontman, Damon Albarn's laconic vocal delivery is as much in evidence as before and there are familiar hip-hop quirks as on November Has Come and funky moments as on Dare, which features the vocal talents of ex-Happy Mondays' singing sensation Shaun Ryder, but overall the Demon Days is a more sophisticated work than its predecessor.<br /><br />Funky pop seeps through on the new single, Feel Good Inc, but many of the tunes attempt to gain access to places Gorillaz's earlier material wouldn't have dared to reach for, such as the complex but catchy El Manana, the ragga-tinged All Alone which features Roots Manuva, and Fire Coming Out Of A Monk, which has Dennis Hopper telling an eerie tale to a hip-hop backing.<br /><br />More measured than their first album, Gorillaz have illustrated why they are one of the most innovative collection of musicians around today. At a time when most of the record industry's output is determined by focus groups and TV talent show debacles, Gorillaz are a breath of creative fresh air...
B000ETQRCM|5.0|Pearl Jam are back with their first album of original material in nearly four years with their eighth release, simply titled \\"Pearl Jam\\" (2006).<br /><br />While fans are divided on Pearl Jam's catalogue, I've liked pretty much everything that the band has released. While I am in all honestly more partial to the band's early albums, I felt that the band's more obscure work like the world-beat sounding \\"No Code,\\" (1996) and the arty-experimental \\"Binaural\\" (2000) were fine albums. And while the later-day Pearl Jam albums certainly have the ear of the hard-core fans, the general public, with the attention-span of a fruit fly, has been rather indifferent.  \\"Pearl Jam\\" is an album that is sure to please hard-core fans as well as causal ones that gave up on the band along the way.<br /><br />With the exception of the straight-forward \\"Yield\\" (1998) \\"Pearl Jam\\" is probably the band's most assessable work since their sophomore album \\"Vs.\\" (1993). \\"Pearl Jam\\" can best be described as a cross between \\"Vs.\\" and \\"Yield.\\" It has the ferociousness and energy of the former, but the refinement and straightforwardness of the latter. \\"Pearl Jam\\" is easy to digest after one sitting and is instantly assessable, but it also throws the listener a few curve-balls and can be more greatly appreciated with repeated listens.<br /><br />Fans of guitar rock, yearning for the days of when solos were front-and-center, will be well pleased with \\"Pearl Jam\\" as guitarists Stone Gossard and Mike McCready deliver.  Jeff Ament (bass) and Matt Cameron (drums) provide an exciting, dynamic, and sometimes unexpected rhythm section. Eddie Vedder's lyrics and delivery are as impassioned and thoughtful as ever.<br /><br />The opening \\"Life Wasted\\" rocks hard and sounds somewhat akin to \\"Go,\\" the opening song from \\"Vs.\\"  The gritty anti-war anthem \\"World Wide Suicide\\" vents the frustration of the futility of war, without sounding preachy or simplistic. \\"Comatose\\" is derivative of \\"Spin the Back Circle\\" (from 1994's \\"Vitalogy\\") but is still captivating. The psychedelic backwards into of \\"Severed Hand\\" is unexpected, adding to its effectiveness, before heading into the loose, mid-tempo body. The melodic, relaxed \\"Marker in the Sand\\" is probably one of the album's more commercial songs and wouldn't be a bad choice to use as a single. The light-as-a-feather lullaby-like \\"Parachutes\\" comes out of left-field and offers a nice change of pace. The light organ adds a really nice touch. \\"Unemployable\\" an ode to financial and employment woes is probably the album's strongest cut, with its infectious sing-along verse and lush backing vocals in its chorus. \\"Big Wave\\" is a short-but-sweet hard-rocker with awesome dueling solos. The morose, reflective \\"Gone\\" sounds like a cross between \\"Release\\" (from 1991's \\"Ten\\") and \\"In Hiding\\" (from \\"Yield\\"). The utterly somber \\"Wasted (reprise),\\" with its underlying organ, offers an entirely different take on the album's opening track \\"Life Wasted.\\" \\"Army Reserve\\" is another anti-war anthem, from the point-of-view of a wife/mother having to deal with the anxiety of having her husband go to war. Much like \\"World Wide Suicide,\\" \\"Army Reserve\\" doesn't try to give simplistic answers or preach, but rather it attempts to emphasize with the people that war affects.  The gentle and solemn \\"Come Back\\" is one of the band's most personal and reflective songs. The dueling solos and Eddie Vedder's soft-spoken but impassioned hums toward the end provide some of the album's highlights. \\"Inside Job\\" is truly epic and elegant. While it starts off calm and delicate, acoustically with subtle intertwining piano, it soon flourishes into an all-out rocker. The light piano/organ outro adds a nice touch.<br /><br />Pearl Jam fans are sure to love \\"Pearl Jam,\\" as it is another fine offering from the band. Casual fans, and those that mostly liked the band's early work should also check  out \\"Pearl Jam,\\" as it eschews many of the more ambitious and arty trimmings of the last few albums. \\"Pearl Jam\\" is a lean, muscular, rocking album. Even with the year not quite at its half-way point as of this writing, \\"Pearl Jam\\" is sure to be one of the best albums of 2006.s a lean, muscular, rocking album. Even with the year not quite at its half-way point as of this writing, \\"Pearl Jam\\" is sure to be one of the best albums of 2006.
B000059TPN|3.0|From what I've seen, the Criterion label is reserved exclusively for groundbreaking and historically incredible films.    \\"The Rock\\" isn't one of those (though I heard somewhere that a possible justification that Michael Bay will have a place in movie history years from now).    But it is an entertaining ride of an action flick. It's definetely better than your standard action movie. The car chase scene is one of my favorites and city of San Francisco looks great.     There's no point in rehashing the plot summary. It's given above but I will say a few things about how the studio went about this release.    I have the original release and it's just terrible. In fact, it's worth one star because it's a lousy non anamophic release. It's a got a good DD 5.1 track, but a DTS certainly wouldn't hurt for this. Several films were released like this (especially a few early ones by Touchstone and Hollywood). Two other good action/suspense /thrillers released that way are \\"Crimson Tide\\" and \\"Enemy of the State\\", both being re-released as 'extended editions' in the next few days.    Looking at it one way, it wasn't a particularly bad idea on the part of the studio at the time. After all, practically no one had a widescreen television at the time (and few still have one now) but it's catching on as more people buy HDTVs.    In the end I'd rather give this a 2 1/2 star rating, but I'll be generous and give it a whole extra star. This film isn't Criterion \\"worthy\\", but it's entertaining and the bonus disc has a huge amount of extras. I just wish they released a decent edition of this film by itself with a DTS track and anamorphic transfer for a much cheaper price. I'm not convinced this is worth paying anywhere near what it's asking for unless you either completely love this film (I like it's soundtrack and would buy it if it included that by itself) or don't mind shelling out money for a good but, not extraordinary piece of work.
B000DZIGDU|4.0|Jarhead is a great movie that takes a look at human nature and the psyche of our mind.  The only real war we are fight is our self. The young man in the movie comes to realize that. There no real enemy it just people killing people. I never been in the military, I don't know what happen during Golf war and Hollywood has sensationalize the event taking place in the movie, but I think there is some truth to the movie. War is war and Hollywood will keep making war movies until there are no more wars. If you do not like this movie is because you are lying to yourself.
0780020685|5.0|I don't have any problems with long films, but I was a bit skeptical if I could sit through a film that clocked in at almost 3 and a half hours, that too in black and white with subtitles.  <br /> <br />But I'm pleased to say it kept my attention and I see why it is hailed as one of the greatest films of all time. <br /> <br />First of all, the plot is very universal. Most every culture has variations of the theme (a village is threatened by gangs/thugs/etc and a group is hired or asked to help them).  <br /> <br />You will also understand many of the influences action films have had from this.  <br />  <br />I haven't seen the Criterion edition of this film, but I look forward to seeing the commentary as well by the film expert. It might prove to be interesting as well.
B000EULJLU|5.0|I'd review this album but that would slander everything Tool represents.
B000EULJLU|5.0|Personally, the first time I heard this record (not the fourth or fifth, etc...) I was totally blown away. How in the heck does anyone write a song with a structure like \\"Rosetta Stoned\\"? It's hilarious all the comments about how the songs are just noodling, formless riffs played ad nauseum. Not so. That speaks more to the listener's attention span. Nothing TOOL does is unintentional. Every note on the album -- every song in the track list is placed just so. <br /> <br />I really think that listening to the album from start to finish is an awesome experience. Lateralus achieved an over-arching theme in many ways, but the encompassing themes in the structure and content of the music on this record (as a whole) is amazing. Example: \\"Viginti Tres\\" is an ambient track, it's true...but it's also set up as a conscious point of re-entry and re-integration after the listening experience. If you're looking for ditties you can play in your car or on your iPod, it's true that this probably ain't one of them. So what?!? That doesn't devalue the track at all. <br /> <br />This is not Lateralus 2. This is not TOOL from the 90s. Those days are gone. Get over it. Every TOOL album is a great snapshot of where the individuals in the band are musically at that point in time. The subsequent releases will never be the same. That's just how it is. I LOVE that this band refuses to stay in one place. How many other rock bands are there who just put out one turgid, chugging piece of ho-hum after another because they're afraid of being abandoned by their fans? TOOL doesn't give a crap about whether we like their music or not, and God bless 'em. <br /> <br />10,000 Days is just ridiculous! There is no other current band at this level.
B000E1ZBGS|4.0|I've read Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice, Emma, and Sense and Sensibility.  She rivals Shakespeare as the greatest artist of English literature.  Both writers were concerned with basic human motivation, but Austen limited her observation to what she knew best, the courtship of 18th Century men and women of all classes.  She particularly enjoyed matching rather struggling middle class girls with the Bill Gates of their day, the local nobility.   <br /> <br />Keira Knightley makes a lovely Elizabeth Bennet.  She's has every virtue and flaw that her love match, Mr. Darcy possesses, and there is the problem.  They are so alike, they are blind to each other's virtues initially, obsessing upon their human foibles instead, mostly their unmitigated pride.  But what smitten couple of any century is any different.  Ah, Austen is universally appreciated since she spotlights what most Earthly inhabitants will encounter one or more times in a lifetime, love. <br /> <br />I think I may prefer the Laurence Olivier version made in the 1930's.  After all, his Darcy is superb, never to be duplicated, but this newer version uses modern color cinematography to advantage.  Jane Austen is always worthwhile.  This is an excellent rendition. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
B0002Y4TZG|5.0|If you're thinking of buying this edition of \\"London Calling,\\" chances are the original album needs no introduction.  But if you are unfamiliar with it, suffice to say it's one of the very best hard rock albums of any era, especially its own.  For a band usually classified as a punk band, the Clash proved to be far more versatile than that genre would suggest.  Elements of everything from rockabilly to reggae put in an appearance here, all with an unmistakably punk attitude.  Listening to the original album gives you the feeling that the style would have lasted much longer than it did if all those bands had learned how to play their instruments this well. <br /> <br />But odds are you knew that!  What of the extras?  The Vanilla Tapes were new to me, although they're apparently already well known among more serious Clash fans.  In any case, they're probably only of interest to serious fans.  The sound quality is generally poor, and most of the tracks are essentially practice runs for what ended up on the album.  That said, there are a couple of previously unreleased songs here that are a nice addition.  \\"Lonesome Me\\" is the best of these, an unlikely country-rocker that doesn't quite fit the sound of the final album but sounds great among the practice tapes.  Also of note is \\"Where You Gonna Go (Soweto),\\" which fits the London Calling sound so perfectly you'll be sure you'd heard it before.  So if the original album is among your favorites, the extra CD is worth a listen. <br /> <br />As for the DVD, I'm surprised it's not more popular among the other reviewers.  My only problem with it is that a lot of the vintage footage (much of it newly discovered according to the liner notes) is all too short and gives you just a taste of seeing the boys live in 1979.  Still, it's great to see even snippets of the actual recording of the album and vintage concert footage.  There are also some great memories from the surviving members and their friends, notably the story behindthat picture of Paul Simonon destroying his bass, and Joe Strummer's hilarious reaction to the news that Rolling Stone had named London Calling the best album of the '80s. (Hint: if you're old enough to remember when the album really came out, your reaction was probably the same!)
B000EHRVP6|4.0|Hostel is a horror produced by Quentin Tarantino (Kill Bill), directed by Eli Roth (Cabin Fever), and starring Jay Hernandez (Carlito's Way: Rise To Power), and Derek Richardson (Dumb And Dumberer: When Harry Met Lloyd).    You've heard the story before, so I'll just recap: Hernandez and Richardson play two Americans who, while vacationing in Europe, get stuck in the most gruesome and terrifying experience one can ever imagine. Along with an Icelandic buddy they met during their trip, they are lured to a town right outside Bratislava in Slovakia where the girls will presumably give in to any guy who speaks with an American accent. They meet two attractive locals, and later find themselves chained in a horrifying chamber where men dressed up as surgeons pay to committ random acts of torture.     Before watching Hostel, I was hesitant in forcing myself to watch a movie I knew would probably make me nauseous, but to be honest, it wasn't all that bad as they make it out to be.    Even though I found Hostel a bit flawed, the idea of the movie is original, the execution is accurate with all the gore and disgust, and the act of revenge in the ending is refreshing...all within 94 minutes of running time.    Recommended    B-

0887307280|5.0|About 3 years ago, our accountant handed us a copy of E-Myth and told us to read it.  Being very busy as business owners, we shelved it and forgot it.  Now our business is failing and we'll be closing soon.  Only now have we taken the book down, blown off the dust, and read it.   <br /> <br />Michael Gerber knows small business owners like no one else I've ever read.  He could be me!  I'm exhausted.  I've worked 90 hours a week for 5 years now.  The store cannot run without me and my husband, so we're chained to it 6 days a week.  No vacations, no time off, not even sick leave.  I'm sick and tired of my business and I don't care anymore.  I just want it over with.   <br /> <br />This book has real suggestions that, had they been implemented years ago when our accountant first gave us the book, would have saved our business.  We would have taken the leap to hire some help and spent the extra time to find ways to pay for the employee.  Instead, we're so busy working FOR our business, we don't have time to work ON our business.  As a result, not only are we completely burned out, but our business hasn't grown.  We have basically the same inventory, the same ideas, the same tired marketing that we had 5 years ago when we opened.   <br /> <br />If you're starting a business, BUY THIS BOOK!  We're now passing it around to our business friends.  One who was destined to go the same route as us has now hired a bookkeeper, fired his lazy staff, and is using his extra time to find good employees and woo back his customers.  His business is doing great and he attributes it to E-Myth.
B000EULJLU|5.0|I've seen alot of reviews for this album, some bad and some good. I dont wanna bad mouth any opinoins I just want to add my own. There was alot of hype surronding this album as there has been since Aenima. I bought the album on the first day (forcing myself not to leak it before then cause I wanted to listein to the album with the artwork) and I listeined to the whole thing in it's entirety. I wasn't really that impressed, it was good but I just feel that nothin really really jumped out. I have since then listeined to it 8 more times all the way through the last 5 days and I've pretty much gone 180. The things I thought weren't there in this album I now have seen are there in spades. Firstly the Wings of Marie suite are some of the best songs Tool has written.  There beautiful and epic and once you can realize that these two songs our more like a novel having the climax not at the end but more at  2:00 mintues away from the end, you reliaze the end of the song is more like a denoument (a closing up or tying up loose ends).Intension also for its experimental nature and very well crafted amibient vibe it gives off is another song I have grown to love. Now you be may saying why did they put on so much filler though? Well firstly there Tool they can do whatever the hell they want it's there album. Secondly i think people are missing the big picture here this album is not a 1-2 song pop album where you can skip around to find your best track. Tool albums are something you have to devot time to and really listein to all the way through because this album especailly feels like a work of art that can't be noticed for its beauty until time goes on. Maybe I'll change my mind about the album in 2 years and say nah it wasn't that great but for now its my second favorite in the Tool cannon right behind Aenima and I think it will be that way until there next one comes out

B000EULJLU|2.0|What happened? Perhaps the most disappointing album to come out by one of my favorite bands in a long time. Imagine Tool's 'Lateralus.' Now imagine all the passion, instensity and general awesomeness completely stripped away from the album and you basically have the depressingly inadequate '10,000 Days.' The first four tracks are absolute masterpieces, featuring some of the best musicianship and arrangements ever done by Tool, in particular 'Wings for Marie Pts. 1&2.' Beyond these songs, however, the content is almost non-existent. Whether it be the short soundscapes of 'Lipan Conjuring' and 'Lost Keys' or the ridiculously awful 'Roseta Stoned', the latter half of the album completely flounders. Maybe next time Maynard...
B000002VCT|4.0|Released in 1978, the Pyramid album more or less follows the formula of the very good I Robot album (1977), although it does not seem quite as inspired - to me at any rate.  There are however, some very nice and heavily orchestrated pop songs and atmospheric synthesizer pieces that make this a very listenable and enjoyable album.  Conceptually, the album (and I quote from the liner notes) \\"seeks to amplify the haunting echoes of the past and explore the unsolved mysteries of the present\\" - hence, the Pyramid theme.  The musicians on Pyramid include Alan Parsons (acoustic guitar); David Paton (bass guitar and acoustic guitar); Stuart Elliott (drums); Ian Bairnson (electric and acoustic guitars); and Eric Woolfson (synthesizers and additional vocals).  The vocalists (and there are several, including Colin Blunstone) are pretty good and their voices work well with the track they were selected for.  With respect to the orchestration, string and brass parts are scattered across the album, in addition to passages that feature a choir.  Both the orchestra and the choir were directed by Andrew Powell.  Finally, although there are saxophone parts on the album, they are not credited.  The nine tracks on the album are in the 2-6 minute range and alternate atmospheric and interesting instrumentals (Voyager, Hyper Gamma Spaces, and In the Lap of the Gods), with some very well-written and heavily orchestrated pop songs.  Of the nine tracks, Pyramania is the weakest (it is \\"quirky\\" in a contrived new-wave manner) and contributes absolutely nothing to the recording, although it does not reduce the overall quality.  Alan Parsons not only produced this album, but engineered extremely well-recorded albums including two by Pink Floyd (Atom Heart Mother (1970) and Dark Side of the Moon (1973)) and as such, the recording quality of this album is very high.  All in all, this is a good album of British symphonic pop and is recommended along with Tales of Mystery and Imagination (1976) and I Robot (1977).  This trilogy of albums comprises the most interesting music the entire late 1970's British symphonic pop genre had to offer.I Robot (1977).

B000EULJLU|5.0|UPDATE 12/30/13: It has just occurred to me all these years later that Rosetta Stoned is probably the greatest thing ever recorded by this band. This track is compositionally a work of genius. That is all.<br /><br />------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />So much has been said about this album, but what this record needs is two things: repeated listens and a shedding of any and ALL preconceived notions. If either of these you are unwilling to give, then this album may never sit well with you.<br /><br />I will try to be consise, and I will start by saying that 10,000 Days is in no way a disappointing record. In fact, it is better than I was actually expecting from this band after such a long string of successes. It was rough at first to really warm up to, but what I discovered is that 10,000 Days is Tool's most organic and also most in-your-face effort. Note that my discussions of the music are not in the actual track order.<br /><br />Vicarious, Jambi and The Pot are classic tool rockers that need a little while to get fully under your skin, but once they do -- especially Jambi -- you won't get the vocal or instrumental melodies out of your head.<br /><br />Intension is a slower, more ambient piece that was the most difficult of the songs for me to warm up to. At first it seems like an uneventful soundscape, but once you start listening to the lyrics and really trying to wrap your head around the larger picture of the song it becomes apparent how meticulously orchestrated it is. It is followed by Right In Two, an initially mellow song with a straightforward but thought provoking message about the divisiveness of our species. It starts off gentle enough with a catchy vocal melody, but spirals into a twisting wall-of-sound ending that is sure to put a smile on many a Tool fan's face.<br /><br />The album's two epics are Wings For Marie/10,000 Days and Lost Keys/Rosetta Stoned. Wings/10KD is a very specific song lyricially but it is sung with a great deal of emotion and will hit home with anyone who has ever had to go through losing a loved one, especially if there was a longtime source of tension or difference of belief separating you. It can seem long and droning until repeated listens reveal the larger musical scope of the composition. This song's genius is its subtlety. At about 17 minutes for the combined 2 tracks, it's a long song but if you really listen closely you'll realize not a second was wasted.<br /><br />The other epic, LK/RS, seems to be a thematic companion to the song Third Eye from Aenima -- and with a well-placed musical cue, it seems to be a musical companion as well. Lost Keys sets the aural and narrative stage for Rosetta Stoned, and once the latter kicks in, you're taken on a twisting, frenetic musical journey with claustrophobic lyrics that will be especially haunting for anyone who has ever been looked at as if they were crazy when telling an unbelievable story. Such helplessness is so evident in the lyrics to this track -- which takes a while to grab onto you -- and it is not without it's share of Tool's classic sarcasm.<br /><br />I was a little less satisfied with this this album's two 'filler' tracks -- Lipan Conjuring and the closing Viginti Tres -- than I was with ones on previous albums, but they seem strangely relevant nonetheless to the overall mood here. Not out of place or even seemingly unnecessary, just not as memorable as Intermission from Aenima or Eon Blue Apocalypse from Lateralus.<br /><br />There is so much quality music here, it can seem daunting. And with lengthy track times all over this disc, it could prove challenging for those who yearn for the simpler days of Tool. Given the time, these tracks will undoubtedly win over even the most skeptical.<br /><br />10,000 Days is at times the band's most straightforward and at other times the band's most complex release to date.<br /><br />Finally, the artwork for this album is definitely very well done and I don't think anyone has included 3-D stereoscopic lenses in a CD package before. It really helps set the mood for the album and I'm certain that these images mean more than they seem to mean at this point. Tool seems to be one of the last bands since the days of vinyl to pay so much attention to album artwork. Bravo, guys!<br /><br />Genius is definitely at work here. All I can say is that I'm glad I gave it a little while to grow on me before hiding it away forever.<br /><br />A classic.
B000A3DFZE|4.0|Its true, Eric Clapton's best performances are when he is singing and playing the blues.  His cutting guitar licks and passionate vocals on previous releses like Disraeli Gears, Layla And Other Love Songs, and From The Cradle are certainly Great A performances.<br /><br />However, Back Home, Eric's newest release evokes a different side of the man.  The mood is a jovial one with some spunk and spirit thrown in for good measure. Some folks say that Eric's guitar is quite muffled.  I partially disagree as such songs as One Day and Lost And Found feature some good guitar embelleshments.  I appreciate several other tunes that show Eric in a happy go luck spirit.<br /><br />Maybe this release is not quite Eric's best material, but I have to say that its nice to see a different tone to this true legend of contemporary music.

B000EULJLU|5.0|As an OGT and proud member of the Tool cult I am utterly aghast at all the negative comments about their latest release. I think a large segment of fans miss the old days of primal rage and hostile aggression when Maynard would scream his vitriol and stare into the audience ready to kill someone. I was a young angry twenty-something at the time and relished the shows from the Undertow/Aenima era but I've grown older and wiser as has Maynard who appears to have attained some form of spiritual enlightenment that was reflective of the tranquil transition that is Lateralus. While his performance and demeanor was still rough around the edges he chose to \\"let this go\\" whatever that horror was that's always haunted him. Lateralus was a moment of pause, reflection, disposition, and at the end of The Grudge a catharsis. The \\"stone\\" was purged. I'm just guessing of course, Maynard has always been an enigma. <br />Many fans however didn't care for the more laid back, soothing, meditative moments of the Lateralus shows which continues in 10,000 days by far the most eclectic, complex, deeply layered, cerebral release yet. I suspect they just wanna rock out and punch someone in the mosh pit like the old days. Alas, Tool's nonstop evolution and metamorphosis to sublime beauty and artistic apotheosis has surpassed them leaving us to enjoy this special moment in musical history. <br />I was breathless when I first embraced the CD and hit the play button. It didn't take several listens to comprehend it I was immediately overwhelmed and carried away far beyond this world. Every listen is an ethereal, visceral, transcendental journey to the divine and I can't stop listening to it. Being an old metalhead Jambi and Vicarious were early favorites because they rock so immensely but within a few days Right in Two and 10,000 Days have taken over as I am so moved and almost in tears every time I hear them. I cannot even imagine what these songs will be like in concert with the amazing visualsto accompany them. Right in Two may go down as Tool's masterpiece. Beyond words. The Pot is a nice change of pace with the obligatory bashing of the current administration which is now a requirement for every new rock album. Justin has always been a tremendous bass player but this is his finest work so far. After a more laid back performance on Lateralus Adam is back with the raw gusto and forceful fretwork that was all over Aenima. <br />Before being dismissed as a fanatic who can find no wrong I do have some criticism. It's usually a bad sign when a band decides to produce themselves as Tool has done here. Every band no matter how good needs an objective listener and co-producer. Which begs the question- where is David Bottrill??? His work on Aenima and Lateralus is nothing short of amazing. Why on earth would they not bring him back?! The overall sound and mixing job is average at best. Danny's drum sound is a bit weak compared to previous albums especially Lateralus which just knocked your socks off. Yes, Maynard's voice takes a backseat and not nearly as dominant as before but maybe it's on purpose. His vocal chords have taken alot of abuse over the years. Rosetta Stoned is so reminiscent of Third Eye in sound and style it seems like an inferior sequel to that song and turns into a jam session that doesn't go anywhere.  <br />Aside from those minor setbacks they have surpassed the great things I expected. This album as well as the entire Tool catalog has altered me and had such a profound positive effect on my life I cannot even describe it. Thank you gentlemen.
B000BJS4TO|4.0|I have always liked John Williams ever since I heard Hook.  He's a good composer and this soundtrack shows that. <br /> <br />I like this soundtrack but everyone else has covered why it's good so I won't bother. <br /> <br />I just have one problem and that's the 'Going to School' track.  It was a good try, and he didn't horribly ruin it, but the original is better.  Also, give credit where credit is due.  That track belongs to David Byrne and he did a wonderful job with it the first time.
B000EULJLU|4.0|I've been a follower of tool sense the begening, I was soarly disapointed with their last album, which by sheer happetence manage to pick up teeny boppers and slut puppy's, as fans.. I was hoping for salvation in this album, and at first I was let down.. But I figured I owe'd it to them to keep listening to this CD, the CD at first is hard to get use to, but the more you listen to it, the more it grows on you, though not up to par with the first 3 albums, it far surprasses lateralus in the dark artistic romantic chords that were tool. the only thing that could make this album better is if it somehow kept the teeny boppers away from their shows.
B000006TSC|4.0|UK's Camel were contenders on the progressive scene, but had to take second place behind bands like Genesis, Jethro Tull and Yes in the popularity stakes. This doesn't mean their music is any way inferior - Camel simply lacked the sheer audacity of pretension and scale of ambition that made works such as Lamb Lies Down on Broadway, Songs from the Wood or Close to the Edge set texts in the 70s progressive canon. Camel chose to plough their own furrow, offering up a smooth blend of - mainly instrumental - rock with jazzy and classical overtones. And herein lies the secret of their failure - Camel were happiest doing long, meandering pieces and suites, letting Andrew Latimer's eloquent guitar do the talking while Pete Bardens' dreamy keyboards filled in the gaps. This worked well on records like Snowgoose and Mirage, but record company only wanted to release records with real singing, so Camel had to start writing tunes with lyrics. Breathless was the result of this new direction. More singing, broader appeal. But Camel never sold out the way Genesis did, and were never interested in courting chart success or blagging a slot on Top of the Pops. Breathless therefore remains refreshingly uncommercial, with the towering 7-minute magnum opus Echoes (Latimer's guitar playing on fire here), the jaunty goings on Down on the Farm (with some lovely flute work from Mel Collins); the poppy, infectious You Make Me Smile (and it does); the funky, danceable Summer Lightning and the joyous opening salvo of Breathless - all wonderful stuff. There's even a lengthy jam, The Sleeper, that sounds like an outtake from Moonmadness, but still a highlight. There are some weaknesses - on Starlight Ride, there`s a dire cod-baroque twiddling (now you realise why punk rock came along), on Wing and a Prayer Andy Latimer's shortcomings as a lyricist rear their collective heads. The sleevework and packaging is poor (compare this to Moonmadness) and the liner notes are unispired. So, not a coherent album concept, then, but more of a treasure grove of goodies to sooth our tired ears. Although less meditative than Moonmadness, and while lacking the artistic coherency of that album, these are still some of Camel's best, warmest tunes to date.lbum concept, then, but more of a treasure grove of goodies to sooth our tired ears.

630460291X|3.0|This movie, while the idea is great, was ruined by Kevin Costners' terrible, lazy acting. To me it seemed he had no interest in even trying to play the part well. The ONLY reason I give this movie 3 stars is because of Alan Rickmans superb acting. He did a magnificent job, as he always does and far out did costner. If your a Rickman fan and must own everything he's been in then I suggest going to the scene selection menu and only watching the scenes he's in, it's really not worth watching all of costners' ghastly scenes.
1400079179|3.0|I rarely read novels, and this is the first novel I've ever reviewed. Since it is a novel, and a rather popular one, I don't think a summary of the book is appropriate or necessary...<br /><br />My favorite thing about The Da Vinci Code is the suspenseful plot. Brown did an excellent job of creating a mystery that kept me guessing throughout much of the book. Though many of the \\"facts\\" he drew from are debatable, I mostly enjoyed his creative use of religious history and theology.<br /><br />At a few points in the book I felt like I missed something and had to reread a page or two, only to find out that whatever I felt like I missed wasn't there. I think these were attempts to create suspense about plot points that just didn't come across smoothly. While we learn quite a bit about the secondary hero, Sophie Neveu, we learn very little about the main character, Robert Langdon, outside of his professional career. The result is that I didn't feel very committed to Robert- I didn't care much whether he failed or succeeded.<br /><br />There are, of course, a number of historical problems with the book. For example, the book claims that the Dead Sea Scrolls contain gospels that were not included in the New Testament canon (p254*). However, very few scholars (secular or religious) believe any of the Dead Sea Scrolls have anything to do with Jesus or Christianity. Even the secular scholar I studied them under (Robert Eisenman) believes some of them describe James, but not Jesus. There are countless books that document other historical errors, so I'll stop there. The problem with this is that at the beginning of the book Brown has a list of three \\"Facts,\\" including: \\"All descriptions of artwork, architecture, documents, and secret rituals in this novel are accurate.\\" Due to the fact that many of the descriptions are not accurate, Brown betrays the trust of his reader.<br /><br />A significant element of the book is its promotion of the \\"sacred feminine.\\" After reading all 489 pages*, I don't think Brown made it clear what he specifically meant by \\"sacred feminine,\\" except that it has something to do with sex. In fact, the book ends up talking about sex at various points in some explicit ways.<br /><br />Overall, the religious conspiracy and mystery of The Da Vinci Code made for an interesting read. It was mostly enjoyable, though I naturally cringed at some of the historical inaccuracies. If you're looking for a light religious mystery, this may be a good book for you. However, I would not let someone read it under 16 (due to the sexual content), and I would recommend reading one of the response books afterward so you're not left wondering what was fact and what was fiction.g all 489 pages*, I don't think Brown made it clear what he specifically meant by \\"sacred feminine,\\" except that it has something to do with sex.

1400079179|5.0|It's now a little after 3 am and I have just finished Da Vinci Code.<br /><br /> It pained me having to do mundane things such as sleep, eat and go to work because they kept me form reading this great story. What I really like about Dan Brown books is the labyrinth type of ride he slaps you on. He takes a few key characters and then twists them through so many universal feelings and hidden emotions that you no longer know who the bad guy is and who's really good. Having read Robert Langdon's first story in Angels and Demons two weeks ago put me back in the comfy set of a great adventure.<br /><br />The main idea is to take the reader on a sort of a scavenger hunt along with Langdon and Sophie Neveu as they uncover ancient clues that gathered together wits of many famous artists and scientist on a grand search of the Holy Grail. This story is one of Brown's signature 24 hour type escapades. He takes hours and not days to solve a plot that really looks obscenely cryptic to an average person. I would hate to spoil anything but all I can say it that as most fiction books there are facts and then there's writing, fantasy and taking your readers faith for a ride, make them chose what in the story inspires their personal beliefs.<br /><br />This is a great tale, which reads like a movie and takes no time whatsoever to complete. It might look large and impressive but your eyes will melt it like butter on warm bread. I got sucked in the hidden evil guy, The Teacher who knew everyone's move and who could have literally been just about anyone, Silas the pink eye albino who made me feel sorrow at the end and changed my mind about a few things, close inspection of famous works of art sparked interest I had in them when studying art history at school, running through tombs, churches on foreign soil, solving  a family guarded secret and fishing out the answer to what it was all about - because you might sit at the edge of your eat a few times when the really good parts happed and the smooth writing simply pulled it all together. I had a great time reading this, and I personally think that this story can be very individual and doesnt have to have any negativeity towards it, so relax and enjoy!

B000EULJLU|5.0|There are two types of Tool Fans: Those who liked Aenima, and those who liked Lateralus. People who liked Aenima and are looking for another heavy catchy metal album won't like 10,00 days. People like me who liked Lateralus better and enjoy the Progressive side of Tool will love this album. <br /> <br />Listen to Reflection and Disposition on Lat, and you wont be surprised that the album moved into this direction. And everyone who is pissed about the fillers, I would rather hear melodic chants than how to make soup in german, like on Aenima. <br /> <br />This album after about 5 listens, really stands out as phenominal. <br />I think that their riffs are more complex and the band tried to foucus on more unusual and complex rythyms. <br /> <br />All this is coming from a guy who doesnt really like haevy metal......
B00005JOFQ|1.0|First of all let me clarify, I hated this movie because it was a bad movie.  I have no homophobic feelings, whatsoever.  The kiss between Jack and Ennis when Michelle Williams first sees them is a wonderful scene. <br />I just thought this movie went haywire from the beginning.  First, it was horribly and strangely miscast.  Sure, Heath Ledger and Michelle Williams are compelling and turn in sound performances, but the rest of the cast was completely misplaced.  Jake Gyllenhall isn't a cowboy, he is a great actor, but every one of his scenes was laughable due to his and my uncomfort with him playing a cowboy.  Anne Hathaway was in the movie, I guess, to dye her hair every other scene.  And let me point out the other strange casting . . . Randy Quaid and Anna Farris??   <br />Secondly, while the movie may have been a political victory, maybe they should have focused on making it a film victory.  Ang Lee is a horrible story teller.  All his movies jump around incoherrently and in this case sometimes creepily (the scene where Ennis goes to visit Jack's parents still gives me nightmares.)  He has a spectacular eye and the cinematography is great, as is the soundtrack, but the directing and the script are a mess. <br />Finally, and this is the most important point, (SPOILER) Jake Gyllenhall's death is just another part of the obnoxiousness of this movie.  Yes, it is sad they couldn't share their love to the world.  Yes, it is sad that people attack people just because of their sexuality, but watching Jack get attacked with a tire iron screamed CLICHE!  I wanted to vomit.  It was at that point that I was really just watching the same old love story, like Titanic, without a boat.  Who cares if they are two men . . . the love story is a typical one, and that why it was so easy for so many to swallow.  This is nothing that Guess Who's Comming to Dinner or West Side Story or Say Anything wasn't, the only thing that makes it worse than those movies . . . it isn't clever of cutting edge or worth the two and a half hours.   <br />I give this movie a very vehemet one star!
B000EULJLU|4.0|This album is a must have if your a Tool fan. Vicarious is one hell of a way to kick off an album, next, Jambi, which has a kick-ass solo in it.  10,000 days is a very deep song, this is the song on the album that stands out the most.  The pot is more of an up beat song, it has maynard really singing in it.  Like Parabol is to Parabola from Lateralus, Lost keys leads up to Rosetta Stoned Perfectly, Rosetta Stoned is long and good that way.  Intension is an ambient, calmer song, but good.  Right in two is my second favorite on this album, because Tool has succsessfully combined ambience with hard rock in this one.  All in all another classic for Tool.
B000069KE0|5.0|Like most kid's in England during 1960's we were really spoiled when it came to great music. I however have to conceded that America produced so many groups who defined new genres. Thus it was with Chicago who intially were described as a \\"jazz rock\\" outfit. However this was only one of their styles. Listen to the album and you will hear jazz/rock/avant guard and yes political stuff as well. I remember hearing the single, \\"Does anybody know what time it is?\\" on UK Radio programme called Emperor Roscoes round table and noting that the reviewers just did not know what to make of it. They thought it was two separate tracks !! when the piano introduction suddenly switched to the main tune. Essentially this album is a tour de force of musical styles. Intellectual and Political/Experimental/Pop/Jazz/Beatles Homage etc. My favourites are Beginnings, Introduction and Does anybody know what time it is?,I'm a man,Listen. This album is up there with Pet Sounds and any of the Beatles best, possible the best for creativity and energy. I was lucky I listened to it when I was only 16 years old and free of musical prejudice. Buy it before your ears fail you..

B000002UJQ|5.0|Anyone looking for a strictly objective review need not read further. But if you do, keeping in mind the subjective nature of music, I hope you can allow yourself to drop any pride at the door and read on ahead anyway.    Let's go back a few years. It was 1999 and I was a senior in high school. For a few years I had begun investing heavily into a decent sized CD collection. I had started as every other male jr high/high school student with standards such as Metallica, Ozzy, Nirvana, and the like. After a while, I wanted to delve deeper into different, less radio-played bands.    Around this time, the only songs I really knew of Radiohead's were \\"Creep\\" and \\"Karma Police\\" - the latter of which I was only vaguely familiar with. I had remembered hearing from somewhere that Radiohead was critically acclaimed for their later work, namely \\"OK Computer.\\" So I decided one night to go out and buy both \\"The Bends\\" and \\"OK Computer\\" at the same time, having not heard anything from either album before except for the aforementioned \\"Karma Police.\\"    Right away I loved \\"The Bends.\\" I loved the balance of rock and the sincere, delicate acoustic numbers, namely \\"High and Dry\\" and \\"Fake Plastic Trees.\\" It caught me without much effort. In contrast, I popped in \\"OK Computer\\" and didn't really know how to process what I was hearing. I didn't dislike it, but I didn't like it, either. It was just kinda...well, it just was. Immediately, I declared the Bends my favorite Radiohead album.    Fast forward a few years. By now, Kid A had come out and after one listen I was a little angry. Two and three listens, I was only a little less baffled. Ten listens, and I was absolutely enthralled - enthralled in a way I had experienced with no other album up to this point. I thought it was the album to save all albums. It enveloped me.    But I still didn't get OK Computer.    As time went on I really wanted to get into OK Computer. But, unlike what many Radiohead haters will try and convince people,I wasn't going to \\"force\\" myself to \\"get\\" an album just for credibility and to belong to the \\"club.\\" If I was going to see the album for what it seemed to be for so many others - a true masterpiece - it was only going to occur naturally. Otherwise, I would eventually join the others who thought the album was nothing special.    To get to the point, over the next few years and up until now I have grown to realize what so many others had before me. OK Computer is a mind blowing experience. I realize now that The Bends is merely a little minnow in the sea, and OK Computer is Goliath. From the opening guitar to the perfectly appropriate single triangle \\"ding\\" to close the album, Thom Yorke and co. take you through life in an alternate world, a world where paranoia, urgency, uncertainty, and desparation flow like the very blood in your veins. This world is so perfectly painted, so perfectly penetrated into your psyche that you cannot help but get lost in this world.    I still haven't found my way out.    The point of my story isn't to show that I'm better than anyone who still thinks this album is for pretentious, snobby, know-it-all music afficionados. Far from it. My thoughts are just another drop in the overflowing Radiohead bucket. They are simply to show that this album has come to affect me in ways many other albums can't. There's no reason it shouldn't be able to do the same for anyone else.
B000065TWQ|2.0|I am dissapointed of the this DVD to much cut out during the concert, & more on  behind the scene... who cares!
B000EULJLU|5.0|It's difficult to reveiw an album based on a past bands work, especially since it has been five since anything new has been released. I can barely remember what I was doing five years ago, let alone draw comparisons to anything back then. It was a hugely different world five years ago, it's been a rough time for everyone 9/11, the war, the hurricanes, the tsunami, and everything else in between. So attitudes have changed. Maybe that's why Tool has as well.<br /><br />I am not a \\"headbanger\\" I never have been, nor will I ever be one. I've always preferred, \\"lighter\\" music, I don't care to elaborate, I don't need to. When it comes to Tool though, I can listen to these guys jam any day. This album is no different. They have a sound on this album that draws you in and won't let you go. They have always had the ability to do this, this one is no different. While it may differ from past efforts, this album is far and way the best offering from anything I have heard in quite a long time. Tool, is quite honestly one of the very few music artists left. In an age of cookie-cutter garbage, this album is a breath of fresh air.<br /><br />Much like Nine Inch Nail's new album this album has shown how a band can grow and become different, but yet remain the same over time. Tool explores different areas of music here (seemingly more sweeping, driving hard rock, epic music, than before), but yet they still retain the same Tool sound. Tool, has always had the ability to blend hypnotic and hard driving music together in a way that is pure Tool, this CD does not disappoint. I don't care to go over each and every song, so many people before me already have. If you've enjoyed Tool's past work, you certainly won't be disappointed here. I know I'll be listening to it for quite sometime. That's what Tool does to you, draws you in and won't let you go.
B000002B1M|5.0|I'm writing this review because I've simply had enough of people denigrating off this album - People say that it's Nas' biggest flop following his debut album Illmatic!!! <br />   After Illmatic's success, everyone expected something even better for Nas' second album, and over the last 10 years people have been saying that Nas failed to follow on from Illmatic's classic beats and tight flow, and he has never produced an album quite as good as Illmatic was. BUT, I completely disagree. While Illmatic is a seminal album, there's no denying that It Was Written has far surpassed Illmatic! <br />   I bought It Was Written about 5 years ago, at the same time as I bought Illmatic, and first discovered Nas. I was just 11 then and failed to appreciate Nas' clever messages, rhymes and allusions, with which he peppers this great album. Illmatic was my favourite for a long time. I loved the 'old skool' style of rapping that is ubiquitous in Illmatic, but as I grew older I felt that Illmatic simply got a little boring. Sure, the classics like 'Represent' and 'Life's a bitch' I still love, and always will, but they lack one fundamental thing that It Was Written seems to have throughout. <br />   The track 'Take it in Blood' from It Was Written is the best Nas song I think I've ever heard. The song has a mellow, chilled beat that matches perfectly the gentle, clever rapping style of Nas. I think that the song is all about rappers' personae and how they make stories up and lie about their gangster life in their songs in order to make them more interesting. I can't be sure though because this song, for me, just keeps on giving and never tires!!! <br />   Nas' lyrics are genius on this song and also on 'I Gave You Power,' in which he raps pretending to tell a story as if he is a gun, being abused by those who carry 'him,' with a clever twist at the end. <br />   If you liked the Illmatic style then 'The message,' another classic, has that and introduces the listener to what the wholealbum will contain. Also, guest appearances from Mobb Deep add another dimension to the album in 'Live Nigga Rap.' The album never gets boring - it just keeps on giving, song after song. <br />   Don't hesitate to buy this if you like any Nas, and just want something more from him. I doubted Nas' lyrical prowess when he lost the battle with Jay-Z a couple of years ago, but after listening to this album I began to wonder how Jay-Z could ever beat someone this brilliant!! I wish to silence this album's critics, who say it is a flop after Illmatic. No one wants the same from a rapper, album after album. It is variety of style, subject and approach to songs that set apart the greats, like Nas, from the not so great rappers out there... Nas' albums are all great because in each one you don't know what your getting until you've finished listening to the album throughout, and even then this album keeps on giving and giving. <br />   I put this album up there with 'Only Built for Cuban Linx' and 'Life After Death,' and am sure that you will not be disappointed by this album if you do buy it. Thanks... had to get that off my chest!
B000EULJLU|5.0|It's not as good as Aenima, but come on that was a masterpiece, they very well may never be able to achieve that again. Though with each album they put out I hope they one day do and it blows me away. It is a very good album, however, with a powerful set of songs even if they're not as hardcore as before.
B0009W5JS2|1.0|Question:  What's the worst movie you have seen?  We all have seen at least one, and this POS is certainly one the worst I have seen.  The main character, out of shape and unable to act, seemed better suited to play a street pimp than a hero who saved the President.    I borrowed this movie, and it saved me the regret of spending my money on absolute garbage.
B000B5UL7G|5.0|I say that because Robbie Williams seems to be getting better with every new release, if that is even possible. <br /> <br />The track that I listen to the most is \\"Spread Your Wings\\" but, honestly, I could listen to any of those tracks on a loop. <br /> <br />
B000EULJLU|4.0|I don't think I've anticipated an album more than this one in a long time; maybe since Queens of the Stone Age put out Songs for the Deaf, but not even then.  And actually, I was kinda hoping for this to sound like Lateralus, which I see has disappointed many reviewers on the discussion boards and in the online reviews.  But the overarching criticism that this album doesn't go anywhere, has too much filler, is a disappointment - it's all true.  And, yet, all wrong.<br /><br />To be sure, Vicarious is classic Adam Jones.  He is after all at his best by tooling (no pun intended) around the edges of an idea and then throwing himself into it.  Lateralus is full of examples like this, and 10,000 Days has several cases in point (I am not citing examples on purpose).  On this point I have no truck with the new album.  But while on Lateralus - which I consider to be the best album of this millenium and one of the best of all time, including the Classical and Baroque eras - it all tied together and flowed evenly, 10,000 Days often seems off step.  Not choppy, mind you, but just not quite there.  And Danny Carey sounds somewhat uninteresting, or uninterested.  Usually he is full of fire and brilliance, but I didn't hear it this time.  By contrast, Justin Chancellor has some very nice segments, and I like that Maynard tried some different approaches to his vocals.<br /><br />I'm going to listen to it a few more times, at the suggestion of some of the more eloquent reviews on this page.  I'm sure it will grow on me, as all great music does.  And while I have found some parts of the album that stood up to the tremendous pressure of a five-year waiting period, my overall impression is that something is amiss.  I wanted more; as much as I am happy with the continued direction from Lateralus, I find few phrases that will play in my head over and over and over, which I still get from Lateralus (Saturn ascends, comes round again...).  There is no epic ending, like L's title track, or the climax of Schism, etc.  I'm OK that they haven't written anything like Aenima again, but I really wanted something to catch on to, and maybe that's my problem: I don't hear hooks in their writing this time, save perhaps Vicarious.<br /><br />For all these reasons, I can say I am disappointed.  But I can't say I'm depressed, and I'm not upset or angry with the band, as some people are.  It is certainly a Tool album; it fits in with their ouvre; but I will only be satisfied if this proves to be the low point, and their next project bounces back to the standards of genius that they have set for themselves.  And hopefully, we won't have to wait another five years for it., or the climax of Schism, etc.  I'm OK that they haven't written anything like Aenima again, but I really wanted something to catch on to, and maybe that's my problem: I don't hear hooks in their writing this time, save perhaps Vicarious. <br /> <br />For all these reasons, I can say I am disappointed.

B000EULJLU|5.0|For the first listen, I went into a farmer's field, ate a handful of shrooms, turned on the headphones and sat back to watch the show.  <br /> <br />It's not a CD you can really enjoy but rather experience. It's about as pretty as 10 week roadkill and as inspiring as dieing.  <br /> <br />Vicarious, for example, is not a song to listen to... just put it on and hear it. That's because it's not even musically pleasing, it just builds anxiety, which makes the end of the song that much better as a release.  <br /> <br />A lot of the album is like that. Instead of using dynamics of quiet to loud within a song, Tool goes from dull songs to bright moments to highlight the bright blasting climaxes.

B000EULJLU|4.0|While this isn't ?nima (which I don't think can be topped by Tool),  I think this has a very ?nima feel to it and has quickly made it up to my #2 Tool disc.  Lateralus was good but too much ambience and while this one has it's share I am able to listen to it over and over much like I did ?nima when it was released and this will be getting a lot of listening time.
B00003BDXG|5.0|A hurtful, violent, breathtaking movie.  Harrelson is perfect here - so focused, so scary because you know he's for real.  The images and camera shots are incredibly innovative.  Meant for the TV generation that needs all its info in split second sound bites.  That's what they get.  The only jarring note, and it's a big one, is Tommy Lee Jones, surprisingly.  He is way, way over the top, just too cartoonish to be believed.  Harrelson is sinister; Jones seems merely foolish.  And that has to be Stone's fault, for Jones is ordinarily very good, and very chilling, which is what was needed here.  He was just, too, too camp, from his hairstyle to his suit.  I'm not sure I've ever seen a more violent movie (well, \\"Reservoir Dogs\\").  Did Stone go overboard with it?  Many reviewers called it a satire; maybe, maybe not.  It is the total opposite of \\"Forest Gump\\"; surely in its way a satire too.  One of goodness, one of evil.  And \\"Killers\\" meshed very well with Clint Eastwood's \\"A Perfect World\\".  It's not really TV that is the culprit; it's the parents.
B000E6UK5K|5.0|Just went to two of his recent concerts in the U.S. and have to say I wasn't much of a fan of this album before going to those two concerts.  But after seeing it performed twice, once with david crosby and graham nash and the other time without.  Man this album just grows and grows on you.  If your after a album with instant gratification look elsewere.  But if you want to be touch and caressed and moved to the limits of your senses this is the one. Close your eyes and just relax and let the island take you out to blessfulness....
B000067CPX|1.0|When I band like the Red Hot Chili Peppers puts out a sixteen track album, and only three songs (\\"Around the World\\", \\"Zepher\\", and \\"Throw away your Television\\") are the only songs worth a s**t on this album, then that makes for a poor album. The Red Hots have seemed to change musical direction here, and instead of giving us the usual in your face funk rock, they give us thirteen songs of drab and filler that takes away from what the band really is...FUNK! I have never heard such a disspointing album from these guys, not even Red Hot Minute, and that has an excuse since Dave Narvarro was filling in and his style just didnt really fit. The only reason that I didnt say it was a total disaster was for three good songs, (hence the half star) yet those songs still arent very strong, but passable. This is the one RHCP album that I would skip over, as its not even worth to have in your collection. Do yourself a favor and get the other songs somewhere else (hint-hint) because there is no reason to own this disaster-piece even if it is to fill your RHCP collection.
0066620996|5.0|This is a truly amazing book. Our company was considered to be the top dog in the coutry for around 50 years. Then suddenly it went through the worst period in its history and in the space of a few years it's share price fell to a half. When we were trying to turn it around copies of this book were distributed to all the managers and it seemed profoundly relevant at that moment in our history. A number of processes/changes were put in place that seemed almost lifted from the contents of this book and our share price has increased by some 100% in the last 9 months. <br /> <br />The main point that differentiates if from many other management books is that it is a result of serious time spent in research. Which companies that had been doing nothing spectacular for at least 15 years suddenly went supersonic and continued at this pace for more than 15 years while competition (in the same industry) stayed the same and what was the common factor that the companies who turned around had and that the companies who didn't... didn't. The level of analysis (and in particular quantitative analysis) makes it more credible to me than many 'apple pie statement' books. It's actually a how to book. <br /> <br />The major points are: <br />1. People who are satisfied with being good will never become great and so the biggest obstacle to being great is paradoxically being 'good enough' <br />2. Leadership matters but again paradoxically the best returns are not from the most famous charismatic leaders from outside brought in to revitalise a decaying company. The best performance comes from home grown managers who are humble and fiercely committed and probably believe in the company's own value systems <br />3. The turnaround does not happen by figuring out what to do and then getting the right people in the right positions. It's getting the right people on the bus (and the wrong people off the bus) and only then sitting down and figuring out what needs to be done. <br />4. The great companies had a tradition of being brutally honest about bad situations (rather than rah rah cultures) but confident that it would EVENTUALLY work out (and not necessarily any time soon). This is called the Stockdale paradox after an army fellow called Stockdale who was tortured some 20 times over 8 years but mainained his sanity. He said he never lost his hope that one day he would get free but the people who died were the most opimistic, the ones who thought they would be free the next day or the day after and so they had to keep dealiing with their own disappointments and ultimately they died of a broken heart. <br />5. The companies followed the hedgehog concept (the hedgehog has just one defence and doesn't try anything else but it does that one thing - roll up into a ball of spikes - better than anyone else). They had to do what they were passaionate about, what they could be best at and they focused on one key metric. <br />6. They had a culture of discipline in which rules, bureaucracy and heirarchy were not required. These rules (for the minority problem employees) actually resulted in other places with the good employees getting frustrated and leaving. <br />7. The great companies didn't use technology better, they just used it to enable their existing processes better <br />8. There was no one moment or one initiative that was the key. The employees and leaders just kept on plugging away and after a while they gained momentum and then the acceleration just kept getting faster and faster <br /> <br />Great lessons! <br />
B000E41MS6|5.0|I grew up watching Doctor Who in England, and the new series is a brilliant extension of the best elements of the classic series. Christopher Eccleston is absolutly terrific as the ninth Doctor. Thank you to the Sci Fi channel for bringing the new series to the U.S. I hope they will show all future (and past) episodes as they become available.
B00000J7JO|4.0|\\"Californication\\" should actually be called BSSM part II, since it seems to groove along the same lines. Even though its not as strong, its still a very solid release, and even though there are many songs on this album that got radio airplay, the pop songs dont seem to kill the album. Sometimes when a group conforms to try to write songs to be FM radio friendly, it can really hurt the band (ex. Weezer, Metallica, Korn) but actually if you never listened to the radio, you would never know which songs are the radio favorites. Actually \\"Parallel Universe\\" is a outstanding song, maybe one of the strongest on the CD's, its done so damn tight, once again it sounds nothing like a pop song. I really like this Peppers release, and even though there are some holes, it doesnt seem to disapoint! ENJOY
0060516402|4.0|This is a book that tries to uncover the common traits between companies considered visionary (companies that are regarded as being the standard bearers for the industry they compete in, that outperform the market and have been around for at least 50 years). <br /> <br />I think the sequel 'Good to Great' is better but this one is pretty instructive too. <br /> <br />The 12 myths it explodes are: <br />1. Visionary companies do not all start with a great idea. In fact great idea companies soon founder after the idea loses relevance. A company that is set up with processes that keep generating good ideas (a research lab that attracts the brightest talent for example) will over time outperform one set to capitalise on one 'big thing' <br />2. Visionary leaders and charismatic leaders are sometimes destructive for their companies in the long term since they lead to an over reliance on themselve and do not build successors who can take the company to the next level after them. Humble gritty guys are more likely to make the best CEOs <br />3. The best companies don't put shareholder returns as the prime objective. Although they think it's important they define their raison d' etre as for some greater cause - quality or innovation or pride or people or customers or product or whatever <br />4. Visionary companies do not all share the same set of shared common values. In fact some companies have completely opposite values from other companies and both can be equally succesful. However whatever they value, great companies truly believe in it. <br />5. Great companies do not keep changing with the times. There are core features that they just do not change no matter what. At the same time on the superficial level they adjust and keep ahead of changing times. <br />6. Blue chip companies do not always play safe. The best companies have at some time stake the house on a bet. But it has been a calculated well though out approach to risk taking. <br />7. Visionary companies arenot great places to work for everyone. If you believe in their values then it is but for others it is distinctly an uncomfortable place and many people who 'do not fit' hate it there and soon are ejected like a virus. Fit is vital <br />8. Complex planning is not vital to building a great company. Instead quite often their strategies come from a 'let's try lots of stuff and keep what works' approach that is the opposite of analysis paralysis that plagues other companies. <br />9. The best CEOs are not those brought in from outside to reform a company. They are in fact the ones who have grown up from within the ranks who strongly believe in the company and have grown with it. <br />10. The most successful companies don't focus on beating the competition. They focus instead of focusing relentlessly on self improvement. <br />11. Great companies manage to make paradoxical things work together rather than chose one of them. for example they manage to give freedom of expression and yet have cult like conformity. Other companies try to go one route or the other or fail at trying to take the middle path. <br />12. Comapanies don't become visionary through visionary pronouncements and mission statements. Instead the entire tapestry fits seamlessly together and those mission statements and values are embodied in every facet of the organisation. <br /> <br />Some pretty interesting stuff here.
B00005JOFQ|5.0|This superb and superlative movie is one of the saddest and most uplifting I have seen in a very, very long time.  The acting by all involved is exemplary and Ang Lee's direction is understated yet emphatic at the same time. <br /> <br />I saw the first matinee of Brokeback Mountain here in Ottawa, Canada and at the end there was much sobbing and wimpering - mostly from the WOMEN in the audience.  That is how affecting this movie is to viewers of all sexual persuasions.  For that reason I believe the Academy Award for Best Picture was stolen from Brokeback Mountain because of the hidden homophobia still present in Hollywood, of all places!!  There must be more gays and lesbians per capita there than any other place on earth but it is the producers and the power elite who ultimately decide - in their own minds only - what is palatable and acceptable for the American \\"unwashed\\".  We must not forget the \\"casting couch\\" and the crypto-fags who produce and cast movies but are married with children yet still DEMAND sexual favours of all persuasions and perversions from aspiring AND established actors in order for them to get the parts.   <br /> <br />As a Canadian I was very proud of the cinematography of Banff and Jasper National Parks which stood in for Montana and the film is a glowing advertisement for the breathtaking scenery of those locations.  The rise in the tourist trade from the US of A must have skyrocketed after Americans realised the natural splendours   <br />existing north of our common border. <br /> <br />The acting by Gylenhaal and especially Heath Ledger is outstanding.  Ledger carries the movie with his anguished non-communicativeness and the scene at the end with Jake's family  will tug at your heart and your mind.  Ledger's subdued and stylish acting there and at the very end is one of the best performances by an actor I have seen in a very long time.  HE should have gotten the Academy Award for Best Actor but then Philip Seymour Hoffman's portrayalof Truman Capote was very tough competition indeed.  It is too bad there was not a tie vote because they both demonstrated their consummate mastery of the art of acting. <br /> <br />The female stars are also very good and since this is basically a family movie about love, longing, and lust their presence is essential. <br /> <br />Every aficianado of fine cinema should run out to get this DVD and you don't have to be gay to appreciate its qualities.  It is a movie for everyone and speaks universal messages. <br /> <br />Very, very highly recommended for ALL sexual persuasions. <br /> <br />TIMOTHY WINGATE   Ottawa  CANADA
B0000AGWJ7|5.0|look, i'll honest. Once I thought that these guys sucked also. But that's before I listened to this album, which is amazing. To be honest, i really really don't care if they're not considered metal, the point is that they sound really good. The guitars are awesome, and if you think that the drumming sucks, then you are in fact a homosexual. as for vocals, i never used to like screaming, but i think thats something that grows on you. so i dont blame u if you think that the singing is bad, but you have to be on crack if you think the rest of the band sucks.
B000AYEI5Y|5.0|I love James Blunt's music!!! My youngest sister found out about him last year when he's still barely known in the US.  She told me she just heard this person with the most unique and wonderful voice.  You must know that my sister is very hungry for new sound, she's tired of what's currently playing in the radio.  After she heard JB, she searched him & found his video \\"You're Beautiful.\\"  She introduced me to JB's music & all 3 of us sisters got hooked. We were very fortunate to actually see him live in concert in Warfield, SF on April 6th, and I must confess that it was the time of our lives.  We'were practically 2 feet away from him. We stood the whole concert for the whole 5 hours, plus the wait outside the venue, but we didn't mind :) <br />Back to reviewing this CD...what can I say is just I LOVE every song.   <br />HIGH--is JB's way of describing how he felt watching the rising sun.  According to JB, the inspiration came to him after staying late at night and witnessing the dawn.  It's very uplifting. <br /> <br />YOU're BEAUTIFUL--I'm sure everybody knows about this by now.  It's his first single & video in the US.  The song is very simple, but very addicting.  I don't know why.  It may seem simple, but it's actually hard to sing to it.  I love this song. <br />WISEMEN--very fun & catchy song.  I love the part, where he ask, \\"Where are you now?\\"   <br /> <br />GOODBYE MY LOVER--according to JB, it is the most personal song for him.  He recorded it in the bathroom of Carrie Fisher (Actress) in Los Angeles, where she actually keeps a grand piano. During his concert, he pours his heart when singing this song, and I got teary-eyed.  I was overwhelmed by this song.   <br /> <br />TEARS & RAIN--is my favorite!  This is the song, which I can totally connect with James.  To me it's about looking deep inside you, surveying your inner feelings & thoughts about life and the present time.  My favorite lines are:  <br />\\"How I wish I could walk through the doors of my mind; <br />Hold memory close at hand,Help me understand the years. <br />How I wish I could choose between Heaven and Hell. How I wish I would save my soul.I'm so cold from fear. I guess it's time I run far, far away; find comfort in pain,All pleasure's the same: it just keeps me from trouble.Hides my true shape, like Dorian Gray.\\" <br /> <br />OUT OF MY MIND--is another catchy & fast song.  love the lyrics: Judging by the look on the organ grinder, <br />He'll judge me by the fact that my face don't fit. <br />It's touching that the MONKEY sits on my shoulder. James using the \\"Monkey King\\" in his logo. There is a great story behind that monkey :p <br /> <br />SO LONG JIMMY--great lyrics & music.  One of the highlight in JB's concert.  He just love performing this song. What've heard this is dedicated to the famous JIMs Morrison & Hendrix.  As you may know, James is also Jimmy.  I guess James is trying to compare his humble self & songwriting skills to the famous JIMs. <br /> <br />BILLY--is about a prodigal son.  According JB, he wrote this song for Billy, an irresponsible friend :) who owes him money and who's now in-charge of website: jamesblunt.com.  Billy is really a coold guy!! <br /> <br />CRY--another favorite of mind. This song is just like talking to a friend while trying to help her open up and speak to you. It's about friendship & sharing during those dificult time. <br /> <br />NO BRAVERY--a very emotional song not just for James but to the listeners.  This is based on his experience as a soldier in Kosovo war.  In concert, he plays the piano with great intensity and variety of emotions.  You can hear in the song what he's feeling...sadness, fear, fury, disappointment,etc.  I can't forget James's eyes and face when he sang this, as if he's reliving the war again.  It breaks my heart, but what a release!!!
B00006M183|5.0|Another great album by Pearl Jam.  This one has been out for awhile now but I just had to put my comment down.  They are the greatest rock band of these times that are now.
B000EULJLU|5.0|To call 10,000 Days an amazing album would be an understatement.  And how can anyone possibly call Wings for Marie and the title track a \\"filler that is much too long\\" as a lot of people before this review have?  It is one of the most personal and heartfelt tracks I have ever heard from Tool. (Maynards mother Judith Marie was parylized for 27 years before she died...do the math...maybe this album will make a lot more sense)  As for the rest of the album it is EXTREMELY heavy, dark, and beautiful....and as far as I'm concerned Right In Two is the grestest song they have ever recorded.
0804115613|5.0|This book was amazing!  Fannie has a gift of putting you right INTO the story.  Throughout the whole thing, I felt like I was right there, on the street corner watching a private life unfold before my eyes! <br />I had to read this for AP English, and I am so glad I did!  It's probably one of the best books on the list!
B00004Y6O9|5.0|YOU should be tossed in jail if you give this less than 5 stars.  <br /> <br />First and foremost this is without a DOUBT the finest debut album of ANY group, period. PERIOD. That discussion is not even up for debate. Secondly, Eddie Van Halen, overnight, completely reinvented the guitar, period. We all have our hero's yes, I understand, but I can assure you Eddie is the number one and ONLY guitar hero in terms of invention. Hendrix? Yep. Love him. Problem is, Jimmy couldn't play this stuff on his best night. NOT trying to start a war here, just stating the facts. It is rumored that Ted Nugent at one point during this tour with VH supporting tried Eddies equipment to see if \\"he would sound like Eddie\\" if he used the equipment, predictably he sounded like Ted Nugent using Eddies amp; READ, NEGATIVE. It's in the technique Ted, not in the wiring. <br /> <br />Thirdly, the production is so stellar, so sound, you would think this was recorded yesterday and not nearly thirty YEARS ago yesterday. ALL the songs fit so superbly together which is the best indicator of any classic album, plus each and EVERY SONG is an absolute winner for one reason or another. The cover art is perfect. The amount of songs is perfect. EVERYTHING is perfect.  <br /> <br />If you do not buy this cd or do not already own it, you may know nothing at all about rock music. If you have it and do not like it, it is a guarantee you know NOTHING about rock music. There are not many things in life I feel as passionately as I do about this cd (and certain others) but there are moments in time when opinion is irrelavent and perfection takes over, this is the time.
B000EULJLU|5.0|This album should be viewed as a whole piece of art.  It's not the radio friendly single album that the mindless public will love. It takes many listens, but then starts to grow on you. It is much like Dark side of the Moon, for a new generation. Each track flows so well into each other that time seems to stand still while listening. It is a must buy and must listen.
B000005RTG|5.0|it's hard to believe this release is over 30 years old. originally released on vinyl in '75, there is not much from that era that can match this one. if you don't own this cd, or have never listened to this, then you better snap it up now. and when i say that not much can match it from circa '75, i'm including some lofty players like Rush, Zeppelin, Thin Lizzy, you name it. the musicianship is absolutely trmemendous, the songs catchy, the vocals on point. this is by far the best Coverdale DP release, and that is saying alot. check out Bolin's guitar work. superb. Ian paice easily out does the likes of Bonham on drums. and, well, Lord and Hughes are just being themselves. i especially like the track \\"love child\\" with it's funky rythym section and catchy hook. \\"gettin' tighter\\" is a nother good one as well, but all the tracks are great. it is hard to believe this is 30 years old. it could be released today and be a hit. it's a shame it never really got the acclaim of Machine Head, and is, in my opinion, a much better album. it has all the taste of Purple, a sprinkle of Foghat, a dash of classic Travers and Lizzy, but puts it all together to make a 4 course, 5 star meal. peace.
B000EULJLU|5.0|Cool 3-d, X-ray Spex that come with the CD. <br /> <br />Sweet! <br /> <br />Try this: Sit naked on a rock, and eat a bowl of Grape Nuts cereal while listening to track #6, \\"Lipan Conjuring.\\"  Trust me, you'll trip. <br /> <br />Ha, ha!  TOOL puts some space between the notes on a few songs, and some die-hard, corndog-munching fans lose it and throw in the towel on the band.  Grow up, or just switch to Kid Rock and be done with it! <br /> <br />This CD is warmer-sounding than Lateralus; hence, less fatiguing to listen to.  It's intoxicating flavor has a dark glow to it, like a ruby or a glass of red wine...I'm drunk!        <br /> <br />This work is an exploration, an education.  It needs to be studied.  <br />
B00005MP58|5.0|I'm not going to talk about the color on this edition of this movie- check out other reviews on sound/picture quality. <br />This is the 3rd rendition out of 4 that I have seen of \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" and I thought it was the best. I wasn't even a Firth fan until I saw this (very recently).  It did spoil me, however, for the Knightly movie (which IS a good movie). So, if you plan to see both, see that one first. And to anyone who liked that one, you'll LOVE this one.
B000F0UV0E|4.0|A good album by two excellent musicians that would have been better if only they had enunciated the lyrics clearer.
B00005JOYA|4.0|First off, the downsides: Some parts of the movie seemed a little drawn out, the film was two hours, and at certain times, you could feel that. It's far-fetched, and I can imagine some people rolling their eyes at the storyline, and there WILL be some people walking out saying \\"that was a stupid movie\\". (As many people responded to Final Fantasy: The Spirits Within.) Of course, some of them will be saying that in response to the sheer amount of gore and violence, which brings me into the 'upsides': This movie certainly had it's 'wow' moments with shock, anticipation, and gore, especially near the climax. Scenes and even alleyways and monsters from the games were almost identical. If you've played the games you will get a lot of deja vu. (For example, the camera goes crooked at exactly the same time and place it does in one of the scenes in the game.) Also, a lot of the sounds and music tracks from the games are used, and so are the monsters. The entire feel of the games is preserved in the film, and you will have trouble keeping your feet on the floor the entire movie. The creepy presentation works, and if you haven't played any of the games, this movie will scare you in new ways.  <br /> <br />
B000BJS4TO|5.0|This soundtrack from one of my favorite movies is the perfect end-of-day music to enjoy in bed or bath. Darken the room, light a candle, contemplate.
B0007Y08IS|5.0|Not everyone will like this movie, and that's fine; I don't like _The Wizard Of Oz_, so use my review with caution.  This film works because of all the absurdities: the overkill and collateral damage in the pursuit of terrorists, the soundtrack's lyrics which are as funny as the movie's dialogue, the articulation and vast number of puppets used in the film, and one underlying premise: an actor CAN save the world.  You should buy the unrated, unedited version for the sex scene alone, nevermind that this is the funniest movie since _The Passion Of The Christ_ or _Philadelphia_!
B00005JNZJ|5.0|I loved this film. Marton Csokas's take on Trevor Goodchild was awesome.
B00005V9IL|5.0|I never write reviews, but this is necessary. I can understand why this film was cut, though it was cut without Cameron's permission. A film about ending nuclear war, tossing out the military, and human beings being a bunch of idiots? Yeah, that doesn't sell. Those scenes, though, make the film fantastic. And I think this film is more than a masterpiece. It's a moral lesson about human agression that just never gets old.
1400079179|4.0|I couldn't put this book down. Every chapter was very interesting and the suspense made you want to read more and more. I liked how he alternates each chapter with a different character in the book and this keeps you on edge and wanting to read on to find out what happens next. I really enjoyed reading this book.
B00004VVNB|3.0|when i was growing up i must have seen this movie 5 times and really loved it. even though i had read the books and knew that the movie was different,but i loved it anyway. <br />    flash foward to now and i watched this again just a while back and oh man did it age bad! the story was always paper thin but at 9 and 10 years old you don't see that,well i see it now. the f/x are bad(but to be fair they were pretty good in the 70's),and the acting is just not there. oh well like they say, you can't go home again. still you may find something to enjoy about it,i mean i still own it and won't sell it so even if it's not great you may like it.
B000EMGAGW|3.0|If anyone has listened to any form of hip hop or rap music as long as I have you know that Mobb Deep's career jump started once \\"Shook Ones Part 2\\" was released.  \\"The Infamous\\" is and will always be Mobb Deep's best CD with classic tracks like \\"Survival Of The Fittest\\", \\"Give Up The Goods\\" w/Big Noyd, \\"Eye For A Eye\\" w/Nas & Raekwon, and \\"Drink Away The Pain\\".    \\"Hell On Earth\\" was decent as well with tracks like \\"Drop A Gem On 'Em\\", \\"Extortion\\" w/Method Man and the title track.  Then just when you thought Mobb Deep couldn't come anywhere close to \\"The Infamous\\" again they blessed us with \\"Murda Muzik\\".   My favorite tracks ended up being \\"What's Ya Poison\\" w/Cormega, \\"The Realest\\" w/Kool G Rap, \\"It's Mine\\" w/Nas, \\"Where You From\\" w/8Ball and both versions of \\"Quiet Storm\\".    <br /> <br />However, after one verse on Jay Z's \\"Takeover\\", Mobb Deep's career took a dive.    After that, my man Prodigy has never been the same.  I am not sure if the diss took something out of Mobb Deep, especially Prodigy, but they have never been the same.  Don't get me wrong I have \\"Infamy\\", I even purchased the double disc \\"Free Agents: The Murda Mixtape\\".   \\"Infamy\\" kept my attention for awhile with \\"Burn\\" w/Big Noyd, the classic \\"Get Away\\" and \\"Nothing Like Home\\" w/Littles but never in a million years would I have expected to see Mobb Deep on a track with 112.   \\"Hey Luv (Anything)\\" while it was catchy did little to try to bring Mobb Deep back to some kind of respectability.    \\"Amerika'z Nightmare\\", Mobb Deep's last CD, was definitely a step in the right direction.   The 1st single \\"Got It Twisted\\" was a scorcher from The Alchemist, so was another favorite of mine, \\"Win Or Lose\\", as well as, \\"Throw Your Hands\\", produced by Kanye West and \\"One Of Ours\\" w/Jadakiss.  After the second single, which was produced by Lil Jon, \\"Real Gangstaz\\" didn't go anywhere, Mobb Deep was on the grind again and then Curtis Jackson called. <br /> <br />When I first heard that Mobb Deep had signed to G-Unit I had mixed feelings.  I was glad that Mobb Deep was signed to another deal but at the same time I was worried that they wouldn't be able to come close to their 2 greatest creations which were \\"The Infamous\\" and \\"Murda Muzik\\".   The first Mobb Deep/G Unit collaboration that I heard was the remix to 50 Cent's \\"Outta Control\\" from \\"The Massacre\\".   Dr. Dre slowed things down on the remix and the track was pretty good.   The next collaboration was a track that featured 50 Cent, Mobb Deep and Nate Dogg on \\"Have A Party\\" which was featured on the \\"Get Rich And Die Trying\\" soundtrack.   The track was acceptable but trust me it wasn't better than the \\"Outta Control\\" (Remix).     <br /> <br />The 1st single on \\"Blood Money\\" is the Sha Money XL and Havoc produced \\"Put 'Em In Their Place\\".   This track was definitely a step in the right direction but I was interested to see what the actual CD was going to sound like.   Die hard Mobb Deep fans may have a hard time trying to stomach this CD.   After about 3 listens you may have to invest in some Pepto Bismol or some Pepcid AC.   Don't get me wrong, \\"Blood Money\\" does have its moments.   My favorite track ends up being \\"The Infamous\\" which for some reason is the only track that The Alchemist produces.  This is definitely the best beat on this CD and the closest that Hollywood Hav and V.I.P get to any of their best songs from the past.   \\"Stole Something\\" has Havoc producing one of his best beats on the CD.   Lloyd Banks comes along for the ride and the results are pretty good.  Havoc also does a nice job on the production on \\"Creep\\".   50 adds his 2 cents to the track as well, but atleast the track is something that you can listen to.  \\"Speakin' So Freely\\" features the Havoc that I have come to expect.   Once Prodigy started to falter on \\"Infamy\\", Havoc started becoming the best lyrically, in my opinion, because some Mobb Deep fans thought Havoc was the best lyrically all along.  However, on this track Prodigy does give hima run for his money.   \\"Pearly Gates\\" features 50 on a tight sample and the M.O.B.B and Curtis \\"Interscope\\" Jackson have their best collaboration on the CD that 50 actually raps on.   However, Prodigy takes things a little too far with his lyrics.  Interscope wasn't having it and you will find alot of parts of his verse edited by the powers that be in Interscope.   I respect most opinions that I hear about religion, but Prodigy might want to think before he starts writing rhymes.   If you want to hear the actual verse you'll have to catch the song on a mixtape somewhere.  I also like \\"Daydreamin\\" because of its dark beat and the way that Prodigy reminisces about the times that they wished they could be in the rap game.   The 2nd single on this CD should be the Mary J Blige and 50 Cent featured \\"It's Alright\\".   This song may take a while to grow on most Mobb Deep fans but this is the next best thing to a 2nd single on \\"Blood Money\\". <br /> <br />My problems with this CD are 1) 50 Cent is on this CD entirely too much.   If you include the bonus tracks, 50 raps on the \\"Outta Control\\" (Remix), \\"Have A Party\\", \\"Creep\\", \\"Pearly Gates\\" and \\"It's Alright\\".  He is also featured on the chorus of \\"Backstage Pass\\" and \\"The Infamous\\".   If I really want to hear 50 on that many songs I will pull out \\"Guess Who's Back\\" or \\"Get Rich Or Die Trying\\".   Why not have M.O.P. on atleast one track.  If 50 can be on 7 tracks, then I need M.O.P. to be atleast on one track, if they are still in G-Unit. 2) There are too many songs where Mobb Deep is talking about how much money they made, are making or how much money they stand to make being in G Unit.  Mobb Deep if you have dropped 7 CDs you should have some money.  Please don't waste your time or my time telling us how much money you have or how rich you are and 3)  I need someone to sit Prodigy down and play \\"The Infamous\\" and \\"Murda Muzik\\" atleast 3 times and to ask him where did the old Prodigy go and to please go find him.  There aretoo many times on \\"Blood Money\\" where Prodigy's rhymes don't come close to matching Havoc's.  I am not sure if he is taking a lazy approach to rhyming because of his newfound money, but he needs to take a long look at himself.   Some tracks you will find totally ridiculous.  On \\"Capital P, Capital H\\" hear is Prodigy: Capital P, Bandana P, VIP, MVP, RSVP or R.I.P, VSOP, ASAP, PCP....   Now I have never claimed to be a rapper and I never will but Prodigy even mentioning this in any shape or form demonstrates how much he has lost his skills.   You won't even want to listen to \\"Give It To Me\\" featuring Young Buck a second time.   That track will definitely get the skip button EVERYTIME.  That's how bad it is.   This may be the worst Mobb Deep song ever made.   \\"Backstage Pass\\" is in a close running for second.   The beat is catchy but you won't be listening to this track too many times.  Just as reviewer, Constant, stated I don't need to hear them talking about groupies. <br /> <br />In closing, if you are a fan of \\"The Infamous\\" and \\"Murda Muzik\\" like I am and you have supported Mobb Deep as much as I have, you may not like \\"Blood Money\\".   The CD does have its moments but the rating of this CD is inbetween a 2.5 and a 3.   I am being as brutally honest as I can be.  I know that is a harsh rating for a Mobb Deep CD, but if you don't trust me you can buy the CD and listen  for yourself.   On \\"Click Click\\", Tony Yayo outshines Mobb Deep on a Havoc produced track.  As much as I like the energy that Tony Yayo brings to G-Unit, real Mobb Deep fans know that's not supposed to happen.    <br />Somehow, someway Mobb Deep has to \\"Get Away\\", from the \\"50isms\\".   \\"50isms\\" in so many words means that just because you have money, that doesn't mean that you have to take the easy way out and just put out a CD.  There was a reason why Eminem didn't want 50 to release a CD this year.  If you don't believe me listen to \\"The Massacre\\".  If Mobb Deep can get back to being hungry like theywere on \\"The Infamous\\" then they stand a chance, if not, the future isn't looking too bright for the M.O.B.B. <br /> <br />P.S. R.I.P. Proof <br /> <br />James' Top 5 <br /> <br />1) The Infamous w/50 Cent <br />2) Speakin' So Freely <br />3) Pearly Gates w/ 50 Cent <br />4) It's Alright w/Mary J. Blige & 50 Cent <br />5) Daydreamin' <br />
B000AMJG4Y|5.0|I just saw this DVD today and wow it was one of the best CGI animation movie I have seen in a while...with great graphics and a pretty good story line. <br /> <br />I was never much into the Final Fantasy RPG games but heard that it is a popular series. This movie kinda got me into doing research on all the characters from the game...lol <br /> <br />It wasnt just the A+ graphics that made to movie great but the characters development and story line, which was better than your average animation. I mean Final Fantasy The Spirits Within (same company?) had great CGI animation but was such a snore fest. <br /> <br />There were some reviewers that gave this movie a one star stating that it had no plot...these people have to keep in mind that this is a continuation of the story 2 years after the game's ending. <br /> <br />I think the writers made the right approach in not explaining about all the characters in detail, which would make the movie alot longer and probably a little boring.  They made both the main guy and girl characters interesting, and I'm pretty sure there are more back stories behind the quieter/non-action scenes between the two.  But if you want to know more about them and the other characters, just do an Internet search like I did or look at the console game cut scenes themselves on the DVD extra sections. <br /> <br />This movie is added to my favorite list of animated movies next to such titles as The Incredibles, Ghost in the Shell, Princess Mononoke, and Appleseed. <br /> <br />
B000E6UK5K|4.0|I bought this album on the first day it came out and waited almost two months before reviewing it. At first, I was somewhat disappointed because it doesn't sound anything like the Pink Floyd we've all come to love and expect. Apparently, in David Gilmour's opinion this is his best work, which I don't really agree with. But it is still a very decent album especially with all the garbage thats coming out of the music industry lately. <br /> <br />Like majority of the people I also think that the lyrics could have been a little more intellectually appealing. I thought Polly Samson (Mrs. Gilmour) did a very good job on the Division Bell but not so much on this one. David's guitar work shines in a few of the songs but in others it was kind of choppy and sometimes forced. <br /> <br />I really enjoyed the On an Island, Take a breath, Red Sky At Night and This Heaven. David plays pretty good sax in Red Sky. He almost sounds like Santana in On an Island. I didn't really care much for The Blue and Smile. <br /> <br />All in all, its a very nice album but it does take time to grow on you. I enjoyed the Island theme and different styles of music (blues, jazz, rock etc.) that Sir Dave brought to this album.  <br /> <br />I think this will be his last album, so enjoy it. Thank you David!
B000EULJLU|5.0|This Album is well worth the 11 bucks its worth way more,the album starts out very powerful with vicarious the first single off the album letting u no that Maynard and the tool boys mean buisness very good tribal drums and very guatiar driven record. it is also an album with a story line behind it may take a couple of listens to get but the album flows together. 10,000 Days is a soon to be classic and if your a tool fan its a must own still tool maintains there title as the best rock band ever...
0375751513|5.0|Would you sell your soul for eternal youth? Dorian Gray did and didn't regret it.<br /><br />So what's the moral of the story? Indulgence and youth and beauty -- these are things that really matter in life.<br /><br />Good book. Bad moral.
B000FL7CAK|5.0|With most television shows, the sophomore season is kind of key. That's when you can tell if the series has long-term potential to be one of the great classic shows, or if the first season will always be remembered as the only \\"true\\" season of what once was a good show. With this second season, \\"Veronica Mars\\" proves to be the former. While most of the sophomore efforts of the big hit shows that I've seen have been disappointing this season (the worst offenders being the ones on ABC, imo), \\"Veronica Mars\\" and NBC's \\"The Office\\" remain as two of the only exceptions. For those new to the show (and I hope there will be plenty of those, b/c the show still doesn't get the viewers it deserves), here's a quick, as-spoiler-free-as-possible, season 2 synopsis: <br />  <br />With her best friend's true murderer finally behind bars thanks to her, 18-year-old detective Veronica tries to start her senior year by getting her life back to normal after the cataclysmic events of last year. As we learn in the phenomenal season premiere, \\"Normal is the Watchword,\\" she'll find that very difficult since the noir-ish town in which she lives, Neptune, CA, is practically crumbling around her. Tensions between the haves and the have-nots have escalated exponentially ever since a mysterious tragedy that occured over the summer. In season 2, the class warfare becomes literal with someone very close to Veronica at the center. Oh, and at the end of the first episode, 8 people will be killed in a not-so-accidental accident that may have been meant for our heroine. This season introduces many more of the shady faces of Neptune, including femme fatale Kendall Casablancas (gleefully protrayed by Buffy/Angel-alum Charisma Carpenter), the new friendy, yet kind of creepy mayoral candidate Woody Goodman (Steve Guttenberg), and Neptune's \\"first family of crime,\\" the Fighting Fitzpatricks. As she gets reluctantly sucked into the season's two big murder mysteries, Veronica will also encounter everything from psychotic babysitting clients to a serial rapist at the college she will probably attend in season 3 to a dead guy who washes up on shore with her name written across his hand, and she will learn throughout the season that \\"normal\\" just isn't her. <br /> <br />The great thing about \\"Veronica Mars\\" that sets it apart from other high-concept mystery shows (yes, I'm referring to \\"Lost\\") is that you have complete confidence in the writers (which was justified in season 1) to actually answer it all and tie all of these threads up into a neat little bow at the end of the season and still leave you dying for more. Next season, this and \\"The Office\\" will probably be the only non-HBO shows I'll be watching (unless the miracle that is \\"Arrested Development\\" somehow returns). This amazing 2nd season is not only more briskly-paced than season 1, but it's also more, as Logan would say, \\"epic\\" in scale and complexity, so this season, even more than season 1, will benefit from the DVD format so viewers can watch the episodes back-to-back to keep up with everything. As a major bonus, this set actually has *gasp* EXTRAS! It will have a behind-the-scenes featurette, a gag reel (Rob Thomas has mentioned that it will be from both seasons. Huzzah!), deleted scenes, and maybe more. That said, if you haven't seen Season 1, what are you waiting for?! That's available now! The brilliant writing and acting alone (Kristen Bell and Jason Dohring both turn in Emmy-worthy performances) make this well worth the price of a DVD set, not to mention the gorgeous and quirky cinematography/art direction and great music. Pick up both seasons. You won't regret it. <br /> <br />
B000EULJLU|5.0|Unbelieveable piece of work. This CD is VERY deceptive because it seems simple and light on the surface, but it is a far, far, far cry from that. This is Tool's most complex and HEAVIEST album to date. <br /> <br />Let me repeat - this album contains Tool's heaviest, hardest and most complicated music to date.  You just need to listen very, very closely and you'll see what I talking about.
B00005JOYA|4.0|OK, I have just returned from seeing silent hill. Did I like it? Yes! Did I love it? HELL YES!  <br /> <br />The movie pretty much has a solid pace. The cinematography is beautiful and the special effects are great. So what about the story? It does get a bit convoluted, especially when we have scenes solely there to explain WTF is going on.....Sean Bean is a terrible actor, he was bad in LOTR, he was bad in that crappy ITV show he was on and he is pretty crappy in this.....I wish they had cut him from the film entirely..his scenes added nothing, except some explanation on silent hill and to remind us that Rose is in another reality to them...also I was a bit annoyed that PH was really only in two scenes...HOPEFULLY he will get used more in later instalments. The ending was a bit upsetting, I get why it happened...I just got a little chocked up (yes I am a wimp, so sue me). The score is wonderful, I really could listen to it all day....I don't know the names of the songs but I would definitely buy the soundtrack. Rhada is a amazing actress, she has a face which can tell a billion tales with just a slight twitch and she is very believable as a mother looking for her child. Cybil actually was my favourite character, in the beginning she is pretty much a tough ass bitch, but she does become more human towards the end.....what happens to her is pretty graphic,which leads me to another point.....this movie actually is pretty gruesome in parts, a little to gruesome for a silent hill movie. The tension in the film is nail bite ting, the nurse scene actually made most of the audience jump and someone screamed LOL! Thats what is so amazing about this film, you get the same feeling you got when you were playing the game by yourself, complete stillness and fear.  <br /> <br />Overall this was a great movie, the visual and grand scale of the movie is so astonishing to watch. It really has some striking visuals...i.e grey children first attack, the first change to alternate silent hill and the final battle which holds much of the gore.  <br /> <br />A almost perfect horror movie.  <br /> <br />
0786852550|5.0|Once upon a time, in an alternative magical version of London, there lived a young boy by the name of Nathaniel, who was apprenticed to a magician.  In this London, magicians ruled the country as members of parliament, with their own invisible army that included imps, marids, afrits and djinns, waiting to be summoned into service.<br /><br />Young Nathaniel was a fairly diligent pupil, until one day when a haughty, braggart magician named Simon Lovelace humiliated him publicly and his weak master failed to defend him.  Angered by this unfortunate experience, Nathaniel immersed himself into his studies, and just like the Sorcerer&#8217;s Apprentice before him, soon began experimenting with magic far beyond his capacity to control.<br /><br />In a calculated act of revenge, he summoned a powerful and ancient djinni named Bartimaeus and commanded him to steal Lovelace&#8217;s most cherished possession.  Bartimaeus is the craftiest, funniest, and least modest fictional character in recent young adult fiction, and his part of the story is the most entertaining I&#8217;ve read for a long time.<br /><br />Of course when magic is involved, lots of things can go wrong, and they certainly did for Nathaniel, his master and Bartimaeus.  Diabolical deeds, murderous plots, and magical mayhem are all on the menu in The Amulet of Samarkand, which I highly recommend to all young readers.<br /><br />Amanda Richards, May 5, 2006
B000000OMB|5.0|Given all the middle of the road shlock that came out in the early 80's, this album was a breath of fresh air. Great melodic rock hooks with progressive art rock leaning, that still sounds fresh today. Of course the rock critics and snobs who roll their eyes at prog rock of any sort will attempt to diminish this piece of work as formulaic pablum, but don't believe them. The fact that they were labeled a prog \\"supergroup\\" made them all the more a target by the predictable music critic establishment (i.e. Rolling Stone, etc).  <br /> <br /> <br />I love music that takes your mind on a journey...Radiohead, Yes, XTC, etc. And I surely put this album in that category. Though Asia's subsequent albums were somewhat uninspired and worthy of lackluster reviews, this one is gold, where every song is great. If American radio wasn't so predictable, 4-5 songs here would be classic rock staples, but of course they are rarely played, other than \\"Heat Of The Moment\\". You'd never know this album spent 9 weeks at #1 by the respect this it gets. Just once I'd like to hear \\"Time Again\\" instead of \\"Jet Airliner\\" or \\"Sweet Home Alabama\\" for the Nth time. <br /> <br />If you don't already own this, get it. I originally bought it on vinyl, but it sounds even better on CD.  <br /> <br /> <br />
B000AJJNPY|4.0|If Sigur Ros' 2002 album ( ) was the aural equivalent of a lonely walk along a desolate shore, then Takk... can be visualized as a majestic flight, creating the impression of soaring gracefully above the clouds on a clear day. Takk...'s uplifting, atmospheric melodies make it a perfect comlimentary piece to ( )'s meloncholic soundscapes, conjuring an image of the afternoon sun breaking through the grey clouds of a rainy day.  <br /> <br />Front man Jon Thor Birgisson's haunting, effeminate vocals once again add themselves to the group's lush melodies as another instrument rather than a focal point around which the songs revolve around. Adding to the depth of Sigur Ros' richly layered melodies is Birgisson's return to singing in his native language of Icelandic after ( )'s simple yet effectively eery gibberish language.  <br /> <br />Although it's great to hear the group experimenting in new sounds, some of the more creative instrumentation sounds a bit akward and out of place. The brass horn section in Se Lest, for example, steers an otherwise beautiful song into novelty circus music territory. <br /> <br />But Takk... hits more often than it misses, as evidenced by Gong, in which mournfully somber string arrangements usher in a mid-tempo drum beat harmonizing perfectly with dreamlike guitars. <br /> <br />Sigur Ros may be overlooked by MTV and mainstream radio, but it suits then just well for their albums to serve as the hidden treasure buried in a chest in a dusty attic.

B000002VCZ|5.0|I just listened to this the other day after not hearing it for maybe eight years or so, and I appreciate it now more than ever. This is a much softer Project album than many that came before, but that doesn't mean it's bad by a long shot. There are a bunch of Project albums that aren't as good as this one. This is just a beautiful album and I use to return to VULTURE CULTURE more than some of the other Project albums. The album closer &quot;The Same Old Sun&quot; is probably tied with &quot;Silence and I&quot; and &quot;Old and Wise&quot; as my favorite Parson's song. Don't listen to the reviewer who said that this is the worst Parson's album because it isn't, and even if it was the worst one it's still a great album. Don't hesitate in buying this gem.
B000002KIE|5.0|The Bollocks album is by far one of the purest rock n roll albums ever put to tape. The production is phenomenal, in your face - something alot of punk albums did not have at the time, which is certainly a factor in why this is considered one of the greatest punk albums. The more I listen to it now, the more I fall in love with it. I will admit I did not like the album upon first hearing it - but then again, I didn't know punk from rockabilly. Once I started getting heavy into punk music and great bands like the Clash and the Damned (and especially physically playing it too), I returned to the Bollocks album and finally \\"got it\\". <br />I hate the fact that some people say the Pistols could not play to save their life. You've obviously never even held an instrument to believe that load of garbage. Steve Jones is nothing short of fantastic - Paul Cook is one of the most solid drummers you will ever hear - Glenn Matlock stands up with one of the best bass players in punk - and Mr. Rotten is one of the absolute greatest frontmen in history. Sure, Rotten couldn't sing you a lullabye, or too much else for that matter, but that was not the point. The point was he was dangerous, furious, and had the stage presence most frontmen can't even touch - he was a great singer in that he put forth all the anger and rage into his vocals. His voice is the only one that could have taken the music to even higher levels of anger and attitude - anyone else would have ruined it, falling short of Rotten's sneering genius. <br />If you're unhappy with this album you haven't heard punk rock. I don't think the Pistols are the greatest punk band ever to walk the planet - there are a few other others I would put ahead of them. However, I think they are high on the list. If Rotten's vocals piss you off, good - that's just the point. This is a great slice of rock n roll and punk heaven - it's simple, loud, and everything rock music should be. Something loads of bands from Journey to Yes should learn from.

B00005JOYA|4.0|I'm not sure what the original comment leaver saw last night, but it certainly wasn't Silent Hill. <br /> <br />I saw a critic screening last night, and must say I was highly impressed. As a fan of the games, and anything related to them, my faith has been firmly established in Gans and Avery, and I can only wish for sequels. <br /> <br />The atmosphere was perfect, the acting was on point, the creatures were amazing, well, everything was amazing. <br /> <br />The town itself looks just like the town we love, and it's almost like coming home again. You'll see what I mean when you finally get to see the film. <br /> <br />Just be prepared for a disturbing, bloody (oh man, the blood), and genuinely creepy ride. <br /> <br />I'd say more, but giving spoilers would be like slapping you in the face. <br /> <br />Go see it!
B00005ASGG|5.0|If there has been an authentic Godfather of the American Western, this is John Ford.<br /><br />This admirable movie with such Farewell taste is a personal homage to this genre. And there are so many details that support this statement: the black& white edition, the theatrical stage, you may realize Ford filmed indoors, the Saloon, the Shinbone Star remarks an important detail to take into account; the Press liberty, the duality between two men who pretend the same woman, John Wayne the hard good guy, accustomed to resolve the villains according his own wild rules: to kill or die; on the other extreme we have the emerging spirit of the law, the civilization embodied in James Stewart who plays the role of the tenderfoot good guy, a good will guy who will understand the Far West will not assimilate so soon those rules of the new times.<br /><br />The legend has been wrought, but we will have to hide the secret. So beware where the historical truth begins and the legend ends.<br /><br />Three giants actors: Wayne, Stewart and Marvin (and three awarded actors), the presence of Vera Miles and the raining star Lee Van Cleef, the secure directorial hand of John Ford. What else may we request?<br /><br />A true classic.
6304981635|5.0|\\"Enter the Dragon\\" is an excellent movie starring Bruce Lee. The movie was released after his untimely death in 1973. I first watched the movie as a young man over twenty years ago and I have seen it several times ever since and I thoroughly enjoy it all the time.<br /><br />The storyline is simple and straightforward enough. Bruce Lee is asked to go to a tournament of martial arts ran by Han (Shieh Kien) on behalf of the British Government. Han convenes an annual martial arts tournament to recruit the best fighters that he can use in his evil drug and prostitution ring. From this is created a first rate film that is full of action and excitement.<br /><br />This is the best film by Bruce Lee. There is excellent fighting which is a treat for lovers of martial arts. One can see why Bruce Lee is the legend that he is. No one has been able to match his skills, charisma and spirit. Incidentally, Jackie Chan and Sammo Hung also make an appearance when they were still relatively unknown.<br /><br />As a bonus, you will also get a very interesting 30 minutes documentary on the making of Enter the Dragon with some new and rare footage.<br /><br />All in all, a skillfully crafted film with amazing acting. This is close to perfect as it gets. Highly recommended.

Brothers in Arms is an amazing song that's full of meaning and great instumentals. Ride Across the River is an erie example of how a song can effect you, I felt the same way about this song as I do about Bob Dylan's Masters of War.
B000EULJLU|5.0|Eveeryone who says this will grow on you is correct.  Tool has produced something sustantial in a world of radio fluff.  The artowrk in the packaging is thoughtful and incredible with the stereoscopic lenses.  A very well-produced work of art on the whole.
0060958324|5.0|Essentially this book is a treatise on a man's ardent search for himself, which has been lost somewhere in the shadows of an obscure past. The theme opens up and is nourished by the first person account of an intense journey undertaken by him on his motorcycle across parts of mainland America. Throughout the course of his journey, he analyses, with passion, and he reasons, without inhibitions; and he raises forth some of the most fundamental questions appertaining to human existence and human action. And brilliantly, he provides answers to most of them; sometimes citing instances of motorcycle maintenance (he reasons that a motorcycle can quite relevantly depict the mechanism of rationality and human life; so the art of motorcycle maintenance is essentially the art of running the machine of the human mind), sometimes citing tenets of the ancient Zen religion and at other times by employing his own irrefutable arguments. Very aptly paced, the book builds up its tempo as it proceeds and ultimately culminates in an intense climax (of course, not a dramatic one!). This book has to be devoured slowly, word by word, argument by argument, and one will certainly get more than involved. Certainly not for the purpose of frivolous reading, this book is meant for those who are at least somewhat into heavy reading. The author's arguments and criticisms in this book are sharp, appealing, and set on a terra firma of awe-inspiring logic; his narratives are intensely passionate and his philosophies brilliant and thought provoking. This book might provide answers to some of the questions that may have been tormenting one's mind since long, or, perhaps, not strangely though, it might raise in one's mind more questions that it would ever be able to answer.
B000FL7CAK|5.0|Veronica Mars has some of the best writing on television today.  The show is full of multi-dimensional characters who all contribute to the world of Neptune, California, while the show's mysteries are well thought out and executed.  So it's a wonder as to why so few people watch the show. <br />Minor spoilers below <br />Three months after almost losing her life to the killer of her best friend, Veronica Mars' (Kristen Bell) life has settled down for the most part.  She has left the private investigation business to become a waitress at a coffee bar called Java the Hut (did I mention that the show loves to play around with names?), and is once again dating Duncan Kane (Teddy Dunn).  She left Logan Echolls (Jason Dohring) after he was put through numerous trials and tribulations throughout the summer dealing with the death of a biker gang member.  Logan's inability to avoid trouble eventually drove Veronica away.  As the school year is ready to start, she is comfortable with her life.  Then she is pulled right back into the P.I. world when her best friend Wallace Fennel (Percy Dags III) fails his mandatory athletic drug test.  In addition, a few other non-09er (Neptune is a very rich town, and the rich kids are known as 09ers because their zip code is 90909) kids fail, as does Meg Manning (Alonna Tal), an 09er and ex-friend of Veronica.  The twist is that Meg was a friend to Veronica during their junior year; perhaps Veronica's only 09er friend.  However, Duncan and Meg dated in the previous season, and Meg blames Veronica for her break-up.  Needless to say Veronica finds the truth about the drug tests, but her victory is short-lived when a terrible bus crash takes the lives of 6 students (including Meg), a teacher, and the driver. <br />Although the crash is originally thought to be the fault of a suicidal driver, evidence soon comes to light that indicates that someone sabotaged the bus.  Meanwhile, Weevil (Francis Capra), the leader of the biker gang with the member that died, is trying to get to the bottom of his friend's death.  While Logan seems to be the prime suspect, the pair both need to find the truth in order to save themselves.  Also, something from Wallace's past comes to Neptune after his mother accompanies Keith Mars (Enrico Collantoni) to Chicago.  Dick (Ryan Hansen) and Cassidy \\"Beaver\\" Casablancas (Kyle Gallner) also get expanded roles this year when their rich father marries a gold-digging step-mom, played by the wonderful (and hot) Charisma Carpentar. <br />The side mysteries are all entertaining, but the bus crash is the most interesting and entertaining, and there are numerous new characters brought in to expand the mystery.  Woody Goodman (Steve Guttenberg) is the owner of the Neptune baseball team who is now running for mayor.  He hosted a field trip at the stadium, and the bus was returning from the stadium when it went over the cliffs.  Terrence Cook (Jeffrey Sams) is a former ballplayer who was present at the stadium.  His daughter Jackie (Tessa Thompson) provides for an interesting character study.  She begins the season as a typical 09er who is spoiled and bratty.  After getting some help from Wallace, they begin a relationship that drives Veronica nuts.  But when her father is implicated in the crash, the students of Neptune turn on her, much like what happened with Veronica prior to the beginning of the series.  It's interesting to actually see the character's fall from grace that was only described when Veronica told her story in the series' pilot. <br />All of the actors deserve a lot of credit for their characters.  Bell and Dohring especially are able to breathe such convincing life into their characters.  Veronica and Logan are two of the most complex characters I've ever seen.  Veronica is still sarcastic and pessimistic, but she is beginning to let people like her again.  Logan displays more emotions in single episodes than some characters do in the entire run of their series.  Sometimes he is a brazen jerk, other times he is sensitive and sad.  Wallace's role increases from the sidekick he was in season 1 to a full-fledged character this year.  Keith, Weevil, and Duncan are all as great as they were in the first season, and all of the newcomers do very well.  Of note are Jackie, whose character expertly adapts to the twists of the series, and Cassidy, whose emotions are almost as ranged as Logan's. <br />Most of the recurring guest stars from the first season return and get even more screen time this time.  Mac (Tina Majorino) and Sheriff Lamb (Michael Muhney) are given expanded roles, and Mac starts a relationship with Cassidy.  Madison Sinclair (Amanda Norret), Cliff McCormack (Darran Norris), and Vinnie VanLowe (Ken Marino) all get their share of comedic moments, and many new characters show up, played by actors like Kevin Smith, Joss Whedon (of Buffy, Angel, and Firefly/Serenity fame!), Michael Cera and Alia Shawkat (of the wonderful Arrested Development), and Lucy Lawless. <br />If there is one thing to nit-pick, it would have to be the resolution of the bus crash mystery.  Fans are very divided on the issue; some loved it and thought that it seemed very natural, while others hated the finale, claiming that it moved too quickly and created some plot holes.  Personally, I still don't know where I stand on the issue.  I will say that I was upset because it retconned something from the first season that I thought worked much better the way it originally ended up.  Still, despite a polarizing ending, the season as a whole is amazing and is deserving of your attention. <br />Sadly, despite the great acting and excellent writing, the ratings for Veronica Mars were still fairly low.  They got picked up for the new CW network at the last minute (and there was a great Arrested Development-style in joke reference in the last episode of the season).  It's amazing that shows so great (hey, mainstream critics love the show, so it must be doing something right) can struggle so much while mediocre and formulaic shows thrive.  If you love good television, you will love Veronica Mars, so please check it out if you haven't yet and keep Veronica and the rest of Neptune around for years to come.
B000002U82|5.0|No wonder, DARK SIDE OF THE MOON is the most heard album in rock music. Pink Floyd, a band which I respect the most, is second to none. They have the ability to talk to your soul with their music, and the finest example is DARK SIDE.What can I say, this album has no weak points, none fillers at all, the best way to listen to it is from start to end.

B000002KGT|5.0|As countless people before me have written and said, this is undeniably one of the greatest albums put out by any rock band--ever. I played it endlessly when I was in junior high--so much so I practically wore the grooves off the record! I got the CD early on and after so many years in my CD collection this remains one of my favorites.<br /><br />Yes, the band was going through some tough times when they produced this music--and maybe that DID help them to produce such a great set of songs here. However, despite all their internal struggles, you'd just never know of it by simply listening to the songs, the overall smooth flow of the song set, and the electricity and energy of the songs and the way they are performed. The CD boasts numerous classic rock songs such as Christine McVie's \\"Don't Stop;\\" Stevie Nicks' \\"Dreams;\\" Lindsey Buckingham's \\"Go Your Own Way;\\" a song written by the band called \\"The Chain;\\" and a song I always liked personally, \\"Second Hand News\\" by Lindsey Buckingham.<br /><br />The quality of the sound is excellent, even after all these years of playing this CD on several different CD players. I love the way the liner notes are so nicely done. You get great photos of the band and the lyrics are there along with the song credits.<br /><br />This CD remains-and will remain-as timeless as the best of the best of the rock CDs. The songs deal with relationships between lovers as well as the entire range of emotions that come about when people are in love, together or be it unrequited. Indeed, Q magazine included this album as one of the \\"Best Relationship Albums Of All Time.\\" When you listen to this album and the incredibly thoughtful way with which the songs are performed it will truly touch a nerve in you!<br /><br />This CD is highly recommended for fans of rock, pop, and classic rock. If you fit into one of these fan groups, as I certainly do myself, you can't go wrong with this CD.
B000AMJDHY|1.0|I was reccommended this band by a friend of mine who solely listens to emo music. I figured that I enjoy Emery, SOME My Chemical Romance,The Promise Ring, Sunny Day Real Estate and a bit of Taking Back Sunday, that this band would be added to this list. I was VERY INTERESTED by the opening notes of I Write Sins, Not Tragedies. Then...he opened his mouth. Possibly one of THE MOST ANNOYING voices reached my poor ears. I tried listening to a few lyrics. The whole wedding theme has been killed by emo bands. Like that atrocity Die My Bride by the Murderdolls. Who names their freaking band Murderdolls!?!? What is the OBSSESSION of emo kids and brides? And who calls a song I Write Sins Not Tragedies? How do you do that? Do you sit there, thinking of of something that would impress people about your ongoing despair? How about you write a song NOT about your b-tchy girlfriend? I mean at least I could listen to the Hawthorne Heights to make fun of them, but this has to be the most bland, tuneless, piece of garbage in music right nowYou cannot sing to this music at all. . Next to Ryan Cabrera. I hate him. Go away bad music.

B000AU9UYM|5.0|Christan Bale as a young Bruce Wayne/Batman is a much needed reinvention of the Batman movie franchise. He has amazing screen presence and makes you believe that he is the Dark Knight. I was impressed how naturally he jumped into the role and made it his own.  <br /> <br />The story is tight and easy to follow. The cinematography is beautiful, especially the parts filmed in Iceland. Big sweeping shots of snow covered mountains and raggedy buildings lining the slopes. Just fabulous. <br /> <br />The 2 disc DVD set is spectacular. The video transfer is almost perfect and there are plenty of extras for the rabid Batman fan. The compilation comic book is a very nice addition. I would recommend this set to anybody.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|What can be said about Firefly that has not been said already? Joss Whedon's short-lived science fiction series seizes the most successful qualities from a half-dozen distinctive genres and recombines them to create an inventive episodic drama that is nothing short of brilliant. The post-apocalyptic spaceways traveled by the Serenity and her diverse crew--with \\"Earth-That-Was\\" left far behind--contain an inspired melding of cultures, lifestyles, personalities, and ideas. Whedon has crafted a unique and unforgettable universe, one that is so believable and engaging that it seems comforting and instantly familiar. There may be something for everyone in this DVD collection. Firefly's highflying adventures are much more than standard space opera. The show's amusing, emotional, and sometimes contemplative stories call upon viewers not only to look to the future of mankind but also to re-examine our shared past, to consider history and heritage in meaningful new ways. The series is almost always believable, thanks in part to some impressive production values. The visual effects, sets, costumes, direction, and music are perfectly executed. More importantly, both the cast and the show's sharp scripts are superb. Firefly is endlessly amusing, it's true, and damned witty too. What's most involving about the show, however, is its undeniable heart. As they laugh and cry together you can see that it would be difficult to watch these episodes without becoming emotionally attached to such a charismatic cast. The only unfortunate aspect of this collection is that it contains so few installments; truly, it's a crime the series was brought to such an early end. Firefly encapsulates the excitement and adventure of science fiction, the soul and humor of a character-driven drama, and all of the down-to-earth charms of a traditional western. Ultimately, however, like all great works of art, the series is much more than the sum of its parts. Firefly delivers on almost every level of expectation and maintains the strength of its spirit throughout. The series has earned its audience accolades and has already become an unforgettable classic. <br /> <br />--Brian A. Dixon <br />Revelation Magazine
B000AMJG4Y|3.0|FF7 was the game that got me into rpgs.. I still play that game. When I heard the movie was coming out I couldn't wait. Now that I've seen it, I have mixed feelings about it. The graphics are unparalleled. Every last detail is perfect, the lip syncs are perfect, everything. The dialogue left a lot to be desired though. There were a lot of scenes where people said very few things and you were just left there to sit and stare at the scenery. Then the whole \\"mother\\" thing. Dont know about anyone else but it ruined it for me to hear people talking about mother and saying things like \\"I want mother\\" or \\"don't insult mother\\" throughout the movie.  <br />I enjoyed seeing the world of FF7 again, but to be honest I would rather this have been a game than a movie.  <br />Bottom line, I enjoyed seeing the familiar characters and places from the game but people who have never played FF7 will not understand or enjoy this movie, unless they like lots of eye candy. <br /> <br />
0060012218|1.0|Boring and irritating. Not one character is likable, and not one character is 3D.
B000AXSN5G|3.0|As on \\"Silver & Gold\\", Young seems focused on creating songs that could become part of the American consciousness. \\"Prairie Wind\\", while a worthwile collection of songs, seems to be built around the masterful \\"When God Made Me\\".  One of Young's greatest songs \\"When God Made Me\\" seems to be a companion piece to John Lennon's \\"Imagine\\". It's no coincidence that Young performed \\"Imagine\\" at the 9-11 benefit. What is interesting about \\"When God Made Me\\" concerns Young's belief in God. Various past quotes from David Crosby indicated that Young typically had an \\"Anti-God\\" or atheist stance. While creating a song with all the necessary \\"sounds\\" of a hymn (a choir, plaintive piano) Young ultimately delivers a powerful and thoughtful piece of music that not only questions God's existence, but his existence as well.
B000002GY9|5.0|\\"Invitation to the Blues\\" is remarkable. <br /> <br />There are several narative threads running through it, telling life-story chapters in a line or two.  The tempo is perfect; Tom's reading is just laconic enough, yet just drawn to the waitress enough to create the tension of the inevitable to come; and the melody is as evocative of the blues feeling as you could want.  Superb work, but glossed over by other reviewers. <br /> <br />There's plenty more worth while on the CD, too.
B000005IS1|3.0|When it comes to obnoxious agression and extreme volume in 60s Rock, nobody--not The Who, not Cream, not Hendrix, not even Blue Cheer--could beat the MC5 as a live act, and this disc captures this band at the height of their prowess. Not even among their Detroit peers. Compare this album to the one fellow Detroit natives, The Frost, recorded at the same spot, the Grande Ballroom, a year later. Whereas The Frost might have been more melodic and technically-proficient than the MC5--equipment-wise, even a year later, The Frost sound light years more primitive and \\"tiny\\" with their little \\"Beatle\\" amps, than the MC5 did the year before. The MC5 defintely had the latest \\"blastoid\\" gear in existence at the time--big Marshall amps cranked to the max, guitars with \\"whammy bars\\" afixed and feedback-capable. The only thing the MC5 lacked in 1968, that the bands they tried to emulate--such as The Who and the Jimi Hendrix Experience--had in their possesion, was the ability to really play well. Aside from the fact that they had one guitarist half-heartedly imitating Pete Townshend on rhythm guitar, and another one half-heartedly attempting Jimi Hendrix-type guitar solos, this band appears to have a real lack of song structure and melody. Numbers like \\"Ramblin' Rose\\", \\"Borderline\\", and \\"Rocket Reducer no. 62\\" are almost like the first attempts at \\"thrash-metal\\" ever recorded in rock and roll--no melody, just pure agression and white noise. All the talk I hear about this band having great musicians with jazz-leanings, I just don't see it here. Maybe it came later. As Michigan bands go, the Amboy Dukes (all but Ted Nugent) didn't play much better, but at least they had melody and song-structure, and I notice more \\"jazz leanings\\" in the playing of Mark Farner and Don Brewer on Grand Funk Railroad's first album than I do this one by the MC5. The MC5 seemed to have \\"song-writing issues\\" like the Stooges, and the fact that the MC5's first album here was a \\"live album\\", perhaps it tooka \\"studio setting\\" to bring out their songwriting abilities. The songs (or jams) here that were apparantely written by the group sound more like improvised \\"on-the-spot\\" creations. \\"Come Together\\" is pretty-much a rip-off of The Who's \\"I Can See For Miles\\" with different, more unintelligent lyrics, and a Beatles title to boot. \\"I Want You Right Now\\", one of the songs that wasn't written by the group, sounds very similar to \\"Wild Thing\\" by The Troggs--almost as if it was a lesser-known little brother of \\"Wild Thing\\"--of course, played with extreme volume and pyrotechnics--a la Jimi Hendrix at Monterrey Pop. But of all the numbers here, the one I find most creative is perhaps the last one, \\"Starship\\". Same sort of concept as Pink Floyd's \\"Interstellar Overdrive\\" and Jimi Hendrix' \\"Third Stone From The Sun\\" (space travel), but with a \\"spoken word\\" monolgue in the middle, given with a \\"spooky\\", ghost-story-type delivery by singer Rob Tyner, reminiscent of the kind Alice Cooper would give later in his stage shows--perhaps the MC5 did have some sort of influence on Alice Cooper during his brief stay in Detroit around that period. <br />As much as I may deride the MC5 for their playing ability, and being as overrated as musicians as I feel they really were--altogether, this is good, agressive heavy metal music, much louder than anything else until the first appearnce of Black Sabbath two years later. Just don't expect their later output to be anything like this album, because their future studio work was apparantely as different from this album as night and day. Once they settled down in the studio and really had to learn how to play better, and actually write \\"real songs\\", the heavy stuff fell by the wayside, and their music became much more tame, subdued, and restrained. Just the perfect \\"Jeckyll-and-Hyde\\"-type band--mild in the studio, wild in concert.  <br />But this band's sloppy playing has really grown on me. Hooks-and-grooves, regardless of the sloppiness, can, asRob Tyner sings on \\"Kick Out The Jams\\"--'stick in your brain, and drive you insane'. Really good music to listen to if your feeling angry, defintely gets a \\"10\\" on the head-banging scale, even for 1968. This is the kind of disc that must only be played \\"loud\\" for best effect.
B000EULJLU|5.0|This is absolutely (IMO) the best TooL album yet.  The music is intense and complicated.  Maynard's voice is in top form, and the album artwork by Alex Grey is wonderful as usual.<br /><br />I have never listened to an album that takes me places like this one does.  I get goosebumps, and even teary-eyed at some songs, including 10,000 Days and Right in Two.  The emotional power behind this CD is overwhelming.  I'll happily wait another 5 years or longer if another TooL CD could be this good.<br /><br />The band has evolved from self-awareness to awareness of the outside world.  They are spreading a powerful message, and it's up to the listener to grasp it.<br /><br />I need 3 more copies, just because.
1573228737|5.0|What can you say about a novel that when you are through reading it you actually miss the characters in it because they have almost become part of your life? <br />Margaret and I had become old friends.  We had walked those narrow prison hallways together.  We had wondered about Selena and her gifts and whether she was what she said she was.  And we had decided to trust her.  Actually, the point had come that we had no choice but to trust her because we were no longer capable of clear thinking where she was concerned.  And we mourned together when we discovered how badly we had been used.  I couldn't have asked for more in a book. <br />The characters were likable, recognizable, and fully human.  The plot was old as time itself, if a bit out of mainstream for our puritanical day and time.  Some may consider this a \\"lesbian novel\\" but I consider it a human novel.  Just as Brokeback Mountain is much more a human story than it is a gay story.  Its theme?  Honesty, pure and simple!   <br />Sarah Waters' work should be topping the best seller lists instead of most of the tripe that sits there now.
B000EQ4G5K|5.0|I love this new album. Rihanna is not only beautiful but VERY talented. Her looks, her lyrics, her body and the way she moves, her sex appeal, her voice is just incredible. She's made such an impact since she's arrived in the game. She's here to stay. I LOVE HER!!  My favorite song since I bought and popped in the cd is \\"UNFAITHFUL\\" written by Nee-Yo (her record label mate). Her new video is even HOTTER than any of the previous. Go out and support this beautiful talented goddess. <br /> <br />Savion~
034544678X|5.0|I loved this book, and it taught me soooooooooo much about  why we do what we do with our dogs. <br />More importantly, it taught me how to be the Alpha dog in the family,and how to handle unknown dogs when I walk. <br />It does read a little bit like a college text book, but gives fascinating information that no dog lover will want to miss. I highly recommend this book!
0812550706|5.0|If I ever get in a conversation about books, I ALWAYS recommend Ender's Game.<br /><br />Now this is science fiction, but is appropriate for people that don't normally read science fiction.  The list of people that are not Sci-Fi fans that have read this book and liked it is large.  This includes my mom.<br /><br />One of the cool things about this book is that it is actually the first book in two different series.  Sort of the trunk, of a story tree.  I really find this a neat idea.<br /><br />The book is a good read.  The characters are great, and Orson does a great job in getting you involved with 'the game'.  If this game existed I would want to play!<br /><br />The main characters are children, and it is very appropriate for teenagers.  I was around 28 when I read it the first time, and have read it five times since.  Had I picked it up sooner, I know it would have been read even more times by now.<br /><br />Just remember I ALWAYS recommend this book, and I have not had anyone that has taken my recommendation come back and tell me they didn't like it.
B000B0QOJA|2.0|I cannot see the hype this reissue has generated. Not counting the sound, this sounds like every other live Coltrane recording, bottleg or authorized. The \\"My Favorite Things\\" has to be one of the lamest ever issued live from Trane and almost sounds like a preconcert warmup. Sorry folks, nothing new or earthshattering here.

B00005JOWR|5.0|Nick Naylor (Aaron Eckhardt) is a lobbyist who has made a succesful career out of defending one of America's most reviled industries - Big Tobacco. He comes up with the idea of bribing Hollywood to use cigarettes in the same glamorous and sexy way smoking was portrayed in the films of Bogart and Bacall. This sends him on a series of misadventures involving the boozing and cantankerous Captain (Robert Duvall), a sneaky, seductive reporter, Heather Halloway (Katie Holmes) and the crusading Senator Finistirre (William Macy). All throughout, Naylor maintains his moral ambivalence while doing whatever is necessary to earn a paycheck.    I expected this movie to be a critique of the evils of tobacco. But actually it was much better than that - as, with intelligence and humor, it manages to skewer a whole host of hypocrites, liars and con artists, including politicans, journalists and the cheese industry. Basically, everyone in this movie is desperately grabbing for money, power or whatever else might advance their own self-interest. Some, like Naylor and his MOD Squad pals, are relatively honest about their intentions, while others, like Senator Finistirre, attempt to mask it with self-righteousness and pomposity. We all play a part, sometimes a less than honorable one, in the human struggle for survival. This movie does a brillant job of satirizing some extreme examples of greed and phoniness while never becoming pretenious or \\"holier than thou\\". Go see this movie!
0670034711|5.0|Reading this memoir of Elizabeth Gilbert's soul-searching trip around the world is both inspiring and uplifting. It is so beautifully written that one feels as though they have escaped into the private diary of a charismatic young woman in search of herself but at the same time the book works to help others who find themselves in similiar situations of feeling lost in the world. Essentially what Gilbert has created with EAT, PRAY, LOVE is a memoir that reads both like a novel and a self-help book. Gilbert was a finalist for the National Book Award and the National Book Critics Circle for her previous work. The strength of her prose lies in its ability to evoke clear and beautiful images with the turn of a phrase. A highly recommended read.
B000EULJLU|5.0|For your visual edification, this CD sports a pair of 3-D, X-ray Spex along with some tripped-out, retro-futurist artwork.      Sweet!    Try this: Go up to Sedona, Arizona, sit naked on a rock, and eat a bowl of Grape Nuts cereal while listening to track #6: \\"Lipan Conjuring.\\" Trust me, you'll trip.    Ha, ha! TOOL puts a little space between the notes on a few songs, and some die-hard, corndog-munching fans lose it and throw in the towel on the band, like they just released a Disco record or something.     This CD is warmer sounding than LATERALUS; hence, less fatiguing when listening for extended periods. Its intoxicating musical flavor also embodies a dark glow, like a ruby or a glass of red wine. I'm drunk!     Check out the groove on track #5: \\"The Pot.\\" It sounds like TOOL climbed aboard the P-Funk Mothership, Area 51-style, for a supersonic ride across astral planes of progressive metal.     One can detect clandestine shades of The Doors, a few covert echoes of Led Zep & Pink Floyd, and--believe it or not--Peter Frampton (the 1970s-style, Talk Box/Wah-wah solo on Jambi), along with some wind, rain, thunder & lightening and music from the Hearts of Space.     10,000 DAYS is a compositional helix of sound that needs to be experienced with an open mind to be appreciated.  If you're not quite up to the task, wait a few years and you might catch up.      Avanti!  (Forward!)

But Gerry has left his wife one last gift: a series of notes to be opened the first of every month for the rest of the year following his death.  Cecilia Ahearn's debut novel is a cross between Marian Keyes and Maeve Binchy.  She has a wholesome and uplifting tone that pushes the reader deep into the \\"cute\\" world she has created.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Firefly was one of the best shows. Period. Joss Whedon combines depth of character and quirky humor in this scifi series. A space western style tale, the show focuses on humanity instead of aliens. Each character has a fully developed history and relationship to the rest of the crew, and the plot slowly unfolds to reveal a larger picture. It has a lot of appeal for a wide group of people. Give it a shot, you WILL NOT be disappointed.
0786890762|5.0|Cecelia Ahern returns with a charming and unique follow-up to her hugely successful debut novel, PS, I LOVE YOU. With her sophomore effort ROSIE DUNNE, Ahern has created a twosome that is as charismatic as Harry and Sally.  Rosie and Alex are meant to be together, but life has other plans for them. The powers that be seem intent on keeping these destined love birds apart. The story is told through the unique methods of e-mails, letters, greeting cards and instant messages. This was a very enjoyable read. <br />
B000EULJLU|4.0|If you are an old Tool fan, that meaning that you got to know them way before Lateralus, then this album won?t let you down. <br />It has some reminiscent sounds from the older efforts, but it takes Tool?s music further again. <br />Not as \\"pure\\" in concept as Lateralus, 10000 Days has the mundane aspect of Aenima and Undertow to it. <br />As usual, there are some trippy tracks, so from 11 tracks, you have a total of 8 real songs, being tracks 3 and 4 related, so I counted them as one. <br />It has the heavyness you expect from Tool, it has their distintic sound. Sonic landscapes, great lyrics. <br />In brief: if you like Tool?s discography there?s no reason not to get this one. It also has one the coolest sleeves/artowork EVER put to a CD. <br />And like any Tool album, it will take you quite a few spins to get it all. Getting the lyrics also helps to appreciate it. <br />This is a sure shot. Get it. <br /> <br />Highlights: <br />- Right in Two <br />- Rosetta Stoned <br />- Vicarious <br />- Jambi <br />- The Pot
B000000OTY|5.0|I never got to see Peter Gabriel in concert during his now revered Secret World Tour since I was far too young to understand the music artists during that time. However I did get the next best thing with his Growing up Tour but that's for a separate review later.<br /><br /> This double-CD set is of a concert performance from November of 1993 in Italy and compiles the best known songs he did up to this point including several from his then-new album \\"US\\" from a year before. But also included are the currently rare B-Side \\"Across The River\\" which was on a world music sampler from two decades before but the live version on this Live album is entrancing and surreal like I've never heard before. I especially love the last minute and a half of this version of the song as it goes from eerie and dramatic to almost optimistic and energetic before ending.<br /><br /> The set concludes with a stunning performance of his best ballad \\"In Your Eyes\\". The live performance of this concert song goes for a whopping 11 and a half minutes and is a beautiful rendition of the \\"Special Remix\\" version of this marvelous classic with a slighly different chord structure and different ending. I would even for far as to say that I even like this more than the album version from \\"SO\\".<br /><br /> Highly recommended live CD. Live albums I odn't think get any better than this.
B000EHRVP6|3.0|For all the hype this movie got, it wasn't as good as I expected. When I went to the theater to watch it, I expected to be on the edge of my seat the whole time. It was called the scariest, most gory movie of the year. But I did not think it was scary or gorry. The parts that were supposed to be \\"gorry\\" were sad attempts. The plot was also weak. There was very little that was exciting or scary about this film.
B00005JOFQ|5.0|Brokeback Mountain was a terrific movie. One of the best I've seen in a long time. The love story of Jack and Ennis, two cowboys that fall in love with each other while working on brokeback mountain. The movie follows their love story, their struggles with their feelings, and their double lives and ends with a sad and bittersweet ending. I loved it.
0393327655|5.0|Mark Twain figured this out long before John Lennon or Sam Harris.  But what's the use?  You can tell by the reviews that this is preaching to the choir.<br /><br />Let's just be thankful that president Bush's religion--which is better and stronger than yours, by the way--doesn't promise virgins in heaven for those who commit suicide.  Then again, if it did, we'd be on a level playing field with the bad guys, wouldn't we?
0752852280|4.0|I had never heard of Gardner before picking up Alone but I will definitely be telling others of her existence after reading this great novel.  Alone takes you into the minds of the main characters extremely well, especially Mr Bosu the psychopathic killer and sniper Bobby Dodge.  This certainly won't be my last Lisa Gardner novel.<br /><br />In Alone, Massachusetts State police sniper Bobby Dodge is one of the first to arrive on the scene of a domestic violence situation where he is informed the father is possibly holding his son and wife hostage at gunpoint.  Through the scope on his rifle he sees the husband throw his son across a room raise a gun to his frightened wife's head and his finger start to pull the trigger.  Years of intensive training has prepared Bobby for this moment and he does not hesitate to remove part of the husband's head with his own bullet.  However the husband is the son of a very influential and rich judge who also has the local police, prison officials and others in his pocket. It is not long before Bobby learns he not only has to deal with the fact that he took a human life, but is looking at spending a large part of his life in jail for murder.  He is also learning that the wife he saved has a disturbing past and the judge and many others claim she set up the shooting and is abusing her son. Soon everyone that can dispute these claims is turning up murdered and if Bobby doesn't figure out what actually happened he will either be behind bars or worse, dead!
B00005B36H|4.0|I like it a lot but it's just not up there with Opiate, Undertow, 10,000 days, and especially Aenima (dont know how to do the old english thing). Still, this album surrounds you like a storm, it radiates with a positive energy, and it is truly an album you can feel. It has more of a buzzing bee sound than tools other albums. Its great, for any other band it would get 5 stars. But its just not quite as good as Tool's other albums.
078062999X|5.0|Ken, you hit a home run on this one. I have always enjoyed your work, and this one is my favorite. Bravo! Id like to see this come to DVD to reach new audiences, but I already own the tapes so I don't think Id buy the DVD.
B000EBEHR2|5.0|I've been a fan since their first release, this album is pure placebo music. Meds takes you emtional trip with many peaks and valleys and leaves you wanting more! If you are a fan this is one album you want to get. Meds to is a combination of all the albums that Placebo has released so far. This album does not get boring if you like to dive in the abyss and emerge in an unfamiliar ground this ablum will help you escape nicely, no Meds needed!
B000001FKY|3.0|Although Def Leppard is \\"pop-metal\\" , this album leans more towards their pop side. It has more of a electronic feel to it.For example,the beginning of \\"Excitable\\" sounds like a robot repeating \\"are you excitable\\". Other examples include Rocket and Love Bites. Now don't get me wrong, \\"Rocket\\" and \\"Love Bites\\" are memorable songs. So are \\"Hysteria\\" and \\"Pour Some Sugar on Me(I didn't really like it, but its one of Def Leppard's best-know songs)\\". After reading the other reviews and listening to Pyromania 20 times, I was positive that this album was going to be the best I've ever bought. After I bought and listened to it, I noticed that this was quite overproduced and DEFINITELY didn't have that \\"Pyromania\\" feel to it. Pyromania, another one of Def Leppard's best selling albums included more of a hard rock feel to it and was the perfect balance between pop and metal. If you are into more of a metal sounding feel such as in Pyromania, stick with Pyromania and Def Leppard's earlier albums. If you are able to accept that Hysteria is more \\"poppish\\" and experimental - go ahead and buy it.
B00005IC2H|5.0|About and hour and a half ago I walked out of the venue where I just saw Sigur Ros play. No, let me rephrase.

B000002UQJ|3.0|Looking for Changes ought to be PETA's anthem.... <br />that's a great song... it's so funny... it's like every once in a while... Paul <br />will just churn up a wonderful song making you forget momentarily that <br />The Beatles are no more.... and then... he'll slip right back into mediocrity.. <br />overall though.... this album has a nice environmenal message and <br />some interesting song-writing by Paul... I don't recommed it unless you're <br />a big Paul fan...
B000EMGAGW|2.0|I downloaded this album about 2 days or so b4 its release, and was going to give it a chance. I didnt hold any bias for these dudes for signing to G-Unit, but after I heard the album front to back, I was completely wrong. The Production is decent, nothing special, but STILL doesnt save this album from being wack. Prodogy cant make nothing RHYME 90% of the time on this cd, and runs on....Havoc? Its the same thing, his flow just isnt the same....The club tracks on here, (and this is what other people havent metioned yet) ARE FORCED AS HELL ON HERE. YES, FORCED, unoriginal hooks that dont become that memorable to the listener....man, deez boys may be gettin put on the spotlight, and gettin their money, I have no problem with that, but had to lower the standards of their music to get it. Just look @ tha cover of Blood Money, Prodigy looks like he's about to damn near cry because he knows they sold themselves out.     Overall, decent prodcution, nothin special    Lyrics, Nothin classic, nor quoteable nor memorable, forced tracks are on here, what more can I say.    Guest apprearances-Didnt do nothing to make this album better, personally, even with 50 on it, this ish is trash.......    I expected some serious bangers on here and dead-on production, but I was completely wrong......    I'll pick up another new cd that offers more than this one
B000001DVD|4.0|Leppard became a household name in the U.S. after \\"Pyromania\\" scored with hits like \\"Photograph\\" and \\"Rock Of Ages\\".  Prior to that third album's breakthrough, Def Leppard were a hard hitting metal outfit lumped in with Iron Maiden, Judas Priest, Saxon and other Brit outfits breaking big in the states as part of the \\"New Wave of British Heavy Metal\\".  Of course, Judas Priest had already established an audience here, but the \\"new wave\\" helped them, too, and Leppard modeled their twin guitar attack after Tipton and Downing.<br /><br />  \\"High 'N Dry\\" was one of the heaviest releases of its day, prior to Metallica's and the Bay areas' thrash bands that were soon to hit and hit hard.  Produced by Mutt Lange, who boosted the guitars up several notches and made Joe Elliot a better singer than the tepid showing on the first Lep album \\"On Through The Night\\" (which still has the best guitar work Leppard ever did, despite the anemic production).  With the exception of \\"Bringin' On The Heartache\\", which probably ushered in the godawful power ballad days of the '80's, \\"High 'N Dry\\" is a great slab of metal, with a pinch of AC/DC to boot, ala the title track and Lange production.<br /><br />  \\"Let It Go\\" still rocks like hell, \\"Switch 625\\" is a great metal instrumental, and \\"Mirror, Mirror\\" shows inventive time signatures and riffs that sadly were not to be repeated again.  The main difference here is Pete Willis, the wunderkind lead guitarist who formed the band with Rick Savage and is responsible for the ferocity and enthusiasm of the first two discs.  The weak spots are Rick Allen, who was mediocre with two arms and Joe Elliot, who, like the photo suggests in the CD, is somewhat of a meathead, especially in his boneheaded interviews.  The guitars save the day, though, and \\"High 'N Dry\\" remains a fine piece of work.
B00004BZ0N|5.0|Its this simple- its the greatest album ever. From the songs to the words to guy stevens production to topper headons amazing drumming to the rock ska punk reggae party political. If you dont own it or like it- well i dont know what to say really!! London calling combines punk energy with every great rocknroll lick- note that was ever played. Ps take some time to read the lyric sheet- what a clever truthful cat strummer was. Ofcourse all credit to mick jones too- and for simonons kingston inspired bass. It was truly a pivotal moment in rock history!!! my fav standout tracks- london calling- death or glory- clampdown- the right profile-lost in the supermarket(for the words).
0440241588|1.0|I liked all of his other books, but this one isn't worth 1 cent used.  I think there was a tax angle here.  Grisham got to write off all of his expenses visiting Italy and quickly writing this book.
B000006TZ8|4.0|All mod cons is wellers dive into manhood and away from the jams early sound. Its more polished but not in a bad way. This is where the modfather would begin to prove his weight in gold- the songwriting is fantastic for someone so young and would continue  for years to come. The anger is now laced under character studies ala Ray davies- the rickenbacker not only barks but weaves great double tracked lines- great use of reverse guitar in \\"in the crowd\\"  This is the start of a great set of albums- Setting Sons- Sound Affects and the final offering of the Gift. All these albums should be in your collection- the Jam were the only band to give the clash a run for its money( the jam were more popular in the uk) and over the long haul weller has proved to be the class of 77's greatest songwriter. Among the best albums of the 70's!!
B0002IVN9W|5.0|I bought this album because amazon kept showing it under \\"you might also like\\". I gave the short samples a listen, added it to my cart...  Now that it's here I can't seem to get it out of my CD player, it's a solid album from beginning to end.
1400079179|5.0|I only read a few novels a year and if a story is not really keeping me awake I have a hard time getting through it.<br /><br />The Da Vinci Code got such a big success, so I gived it a try, and I was not disappointed ! I could not stop reading it, even if I was quite busy at that time. The intrigue is the most solid-built I have ever read in a novel. Brown's research is incredible and the characters are fascinating in the middle of complex and intelligent riddles and puzzles !<br /><br />I have decided to leave aside the controversy and SIMPLY ENJOY both the fictional and historic parts of the story. Pretty sure this one is gonna get a second read after seeing the movie.
B000000993|5.0|There is no common opinion on what is the best Tool album. Some will say they got better with each release, while some others think their first two releases, Opiate and Undertow, are better and more musical. Without getting into this debate, I'll kindly suggest, if you've never heard Tool before, start right here, with their first full-length release, Undertow (their debut Opiate is an EP).<br /><br />The songs on Undertow are all significantly more simple and direct than their work on Aenima and Lateralus; it could be argued that the band hadn't matured fully while they were writing these songs yet, but still, for a 1993 release, Undertow is one of the most innovative discs ever, given how the scene was littered with a million grunge bands at the time. This is not to say Tool has no alternative elements in their music though. The second track of the album actually sees vocalist Maynard Keenan opting for a slightly grunge-styled delivery with great results. However, aside from that, \\"Prison Sex\\" is an ultimately adventurous piece and easily transcends the boundaries of grunge. Pairing a gritty bass motif with immensely powerful drum fills, the song also contains a dynamic guitar theme that soars above this combination, climaxing at the final second, suggesting there is not a single overplayed note on it.<br /><br />Actually, Undertow, as every other Tool album, immediately impacts the listener with its solid rhythmic angle, the amazing Danny Carey on drums and Paul D'Amour on bass (now replaced by Justin Chancellor). Carey's drumming style is absolutely mind-blowing and his tone is to die for, while D'Amour on bass really defines the character of the album, be it with his fat bass lines on \\"Intolerance\\" (with killer guitar effects at the end) or his meticulous grooves on \\"Bottom\\", a song with a phenomenal atmospheric undercurrent that emphasizes tranquil passages filled with whispered spoken words, sporadic bass throbs, and glistening cymbal work. Guitarist Adam Jones is equally important to this album. His minimalistic yet effective guitar expressions are in a league all their own. You won't hear a million flying solos on this album (or any other for that matter). If that's what you're looking for in music, you'll have to look elsewhere. Tool simply rocks in a different kind of way. Sure, their music is riff-based, marked by plenty of visceral rock nuances, and amidst all these complex passages, it is Jones himself who chooses when and where to insert those riffs, each one having a point and purpose. The guitar work of Tool is simply one of a kind. Adam Jones' guitar lines bleed atmosphere through and through, in a very unique way. \\"Sober\\", my personal favourite off of this album, is not only a relentless attack on religious hypocrisy, but it also displays what an amazing lyricist and singer Maynard Keenan is. Just listening to this song, I can already hear how all those new bands, such as Dead Soul Tribe, have been influenced by the genius of Tool's songwriting. The chorus of \\"Sober\\" is so well-written and infectious that it won't let go days after you stop listening to it. And I really, really love Keenan's haunting lyrics. He conveys his thoughts with zero pretense, which, in my opinion, is a big plus.<br /><br />I wish I could describe each track in great detail, but it would be impossible to do so without missing vital moments. Though, at face value, Undertow may seem rather simplistic and concise, repeat listens expose great details. You may be as surprised as me when you start enjoying the numbing guitar drills on the bleak \\"Crawl Away\\" or effect-laden guitars paired with oppressive instrumental interludes on \\"Swamp Song\\". The title track, besides going back to the band's grunge-infused themes, is also one of the vocal-based cuts, where you hear so many changing chord progressions your head spins; while the Eastern influence on \\"4 Degrees\\" (complete with terrific percussion) make you believe they further explored thison their following releases.<br /><br />\\"Flood\\" is arguably the most brooding number on Undertow. Its slowly-picked bass guitar, Keenan's vocals echoing distantly in the background, and dense atmospherics build on through its eventless yet languid first half before venturing into a hard-hitting rock number with philosophy-infused lyrics. The last song \\"Disgustapated\\", starting at track 10 and ending at track 69, is a trippy piece of over 15 minutes, littered with odd sound effects, tribal percussion work, spoken lyrics about abuse and intolerance, and a static hammer sound that goes on and on. I'm not even going to go into the pictures in the booklet, which are equally 'different' and 'unusual', for lack of a better term.<br /><br />It was incredibly difficult for me to crack Tool's music. However, once I did, I never looked back. It may take months or even years, but if you're a music fan with an open mind and enjoy innovation and musical depth as much as I do, give Tool a listen. If you heard them before and thought they were obtuse, maybe you should go back and give their album(s) a new spin.

0670813028|5.0|\\"It\\" features one of King's most complex story with dozens of characters and an incredible psychological evolution from childhood to adulthood. It is a novel about fears, friendship, and the importance of cooperation in the most horrible situations.  <br /> <br />I've read quite a few of Stephy's books and this is by far one of my favorite. It is a very long story, with a few slow paced chapters, but it is really worth getting through the entire intrigue ! Fascinating, well written, King at his best !  <br /> <br />This book will keep any good reader awake for a couple of days, and maybe more if you are afraid in the dark...!
0553212478|5.0|This is the true and orginal Frankenstein story.  My high school teacher recommended this book to me and I am grateful she did.  This book is packed with suspense as well as horror.  You will be drawn into this book and will feel like you are actually living in Frankenstein's world.  Mary Shelley is a great writer and everyone should read this classic.
B00001ZULV|4.0|If I would have rated this item a few months ago, I would have given out 5 stars. But with the release of the new 3 CD box set \\"Platinum Collection\\", I can only say that the song selection on this album is incomplete if you love Genesis music. The new box set has the best quality/value. <br /> <br />However, this \\"Greatest album\\" is still a great choice if you are new to the band or if you really want the \\"singles\\". You should note that nearly all the songs are from the \\"Phil Collins\\" time. For a \\"Peter Gabriel\\" time greatest, get the \\"Seconds out\\" live album.  <br /> <br />The CD duration is well above the average and it is a great choice to discover the band.
B0002STNQ2|5.0|Michael Crichton does and amazing job with this book.  His mix of suspense and science draws you in and won't let you go.  This book is extremely well researched and an exciting read.  I absoultely loved this book and I recommend it to any Michael Crichton fan.
B000EULJLU|5.0|Don't you listen, he sold out long before you even knew his name <br />He tell's you where to point your finger. This is a great album. <br />Everyone spends so much time trying to point the finger and say that this or that sucks and, I venture to say that not one of the finger pointers would have any idea what it would take to make any song on any album, period. Tool is a band of artists who's life long journey is to make music. It is ridiculous to think that this is a big F you from the band. It is another great piece of art from some truly gifted artists, hooray
B0000524CY|5.0|Best horror movie ever even thought or made. No one can top this. Great acting, great story. Still does gve the chills that it did a long time ago. You have to go and see this if you have not already seen it.
B000EULJLU|5.0|Well, I feel sorry for ppl who don't \\"get\\" TOOL.  This album is a journey in art, both in music and in theory.  The CD case is way cool, with nice 3D images to get you thinking what the album or artists are trying to say.  The songs rock and take you away from this daily life.  The lyrics are as esoteric as ever and suggest many things to many ppl.  The haters are..well..just ppl that think they can do better.  I don't get it.  Tool is an unique sound/vision/band/entity.  Please don't compare them to any other band or sound.  That is where you all lose it.  Take it as it is, no other band sounds like TOOL or is TOOL.  No wonder you didn't like it, you compared them to your favorite other TOOL album or to other bands or sounds.  This TOOL album is what it is...bad ass.  Sonically massive and brilliant.  Get out and Buy...buy...buy...spend your money!!!
B000056K04|4.0|Compare the two albums by Dave that get the most negative reviews, and it's like heaven and hell. This is a mfing amazing album next to Stand Up. I really don't understand the disillusionment by all these Dave Matthews fans over this CD. There are some pure golden songs on it, and like any other album, there are some not so great ones, but this at least still SOUNDS like DMB. I never had any doubts about this CD until I started reading such negative reviews. I went back and listened a little more critically, and I still stand my initial impression. Not his strongest, but still an acceptable album.
B000EULJLU|5.0|I remember when Lateralus first came out 5 years ago. Initially I was disappointed since I was expecting it to be as good as Aenima (which at the time was my favorite album) and I just didnt feel like it lived up. Most of my friends felt the same way. After months of listening to it, though, I began to appreciate Lateralus as being just as good as Aenima, but in a different way. Lateralus surrounds the listener like being in the eye of a hurricane; the music is fuzzy and grinding but extremely powerful.<br /><br />My initial impression of this album is better than my initial impression of Lateralus. It has a piercing feeling to it. The structure of the songs is somewhat similar to Lateralus, but in spirit it almost reminds me of Undertow- albeit way less convential and more sprawled out. Its got a more a bass heavy, precise sound. Maynard sounds angrier, although parts are meditative. Some of the filler stuff seems a bit odd, but I feel like it fits in well with the album.<br /><br />There's nothing as immediately striking as Third Eye or Aenima (the song) here, but as a whole it comes together in an amazing way.<br /><br />My only reservation is some of the lyrics felt less developed than the direction tool has been going on, but Ive only listened a couple of times. I'll save judgements on that until Ive listened more.<br /><br />Overall, a great record- both familiar and groundbreaking at the same time.
B000EULJLU|5.0|I wasn't into tool before this album, but it really turned me into a fan. The songs are pretty creative, and the quality is great. just about every song shines here
B000059H98|5.0|The best line in this movie is a single word.  I won't give it away.  You'll have to see for yourself.  In the scene in question, as well as in the whole movie, Tank Girl never acts as a victim and never apologizes for standing up for herself and others.  She's a super role model.
B000005HLV|5.0|This is Mayhem's second LP after Deathcrush. It feastures Atilla on Vocals, which is kind of hard to get used to because his voice is not traditional black metal like Marduk or Kult ov Azazel. THe songs here are all pretty good with standouts ike Freezing Moon, Pagan Fears, Life Eternal, and the title track, but basically everysong is a classic.
B0006GANOQ|5.0|This is one of the coolest, most suspenseful, most awesome films I've ever seen! It's about a cop named Jack(Keanu Reeves)who is facing a former cop, now a villain wanting his pay for his duty as a cop named Howard Payne(Dennis Hooper)He's going through a lot of games, traps and explosives, and of course shootings to try and save the innocent, stop Payne from terrorizing and/or killing people. Along the way, he meets up with a pretty cute little lady and they soon fall in love, or at least start to. In the end, Jack fights with Howard Payne atop a train(what a copy of SpiderMan and Doctor Octopus!)Payne is kicking his ass all over the place until Jack sees a red stoplight. Payne is capped after his head hits the light and snap goes his neck. Jack and his lady then survive the train crashing and their love life begins at the movie's end. It is an intense, cool and funny film that anyone over the age of 15 would adore. I love it and would suggest anyone who likes fighting movies to buy or rent it.
B000002KD9|5.0|Yes, it's a very good album. But the \\"editorial review\\" by Steve Knopper above the customer reviews is very annoying. He writes, \\"He's equally passionate with trippy riddles (has anybody figured out what 'We've got mother nature on the run' means in the title track?).\\"    Huh. Well.  The line is actually, \\"Look at Mother Nature on the run in the 1970's.\\" Gosh, what DOES it mean? That the environment is threatened by our species?

0767853636|4.0|The Amazon.com reviewer could not be more wrong, in my opinion.  The terrific cast makes this version far superior to the 1999 version. There is just no comparison. The 1999 version is flat and boring; this version is full of life. Carol Burnett and Bernadette Peters are especially good.  Go ahead and ignore the Amazon reviewer, buy this movie, it's lots of fun.
B000EJ9MTW|5.0|Wolfmother is pure rock n roll!  Their main influence is classic rock, and the comparisons are endless, from Black Sabbath, to Deep Purple, AC/DC, Jethro Tull, etc. Example: The single 'Woman' reminds me of Queen's 'Tie Your Mother Down'.  Even with the classic rock influence, metal heads should be satisfied, and singer Andrew Stockwell reminds me of Perry Ferrel.  These guys are talented musicians and songwriters.  This is the most promising band I've heard since Nirvana, and I listen to alot of music.  BUY THIS ALBUM!!!!!
0425074811|1.0|I bought into this book hook, line and sinker (and the movie) as a child. THen I grew up and learned that everything you read isn't the truth. <br />It's been proven the author manufactured artifacts (they even found the artisan who made a few of of them aftre being paid). <br />Anyone considering reading this book or seeing the documentary should read the book Crash go the Chariots and other books that pick apart Von Daniken's work point by point. <br />It does make fascinating reading but it's largely fiction. He twists facts. Leaves out anything that even remotely refutes his theories and as mentioned before manufactured 'evidence' where none existed. <br />A bullet hole in a 40,000 year old Bison skull? How laughable is that? <br />THis book IS valuable in that it can be used a teaching tool to show students they shouldn't believe everything they read. <br />Every year some 'scientist' announces he's found Atlantis. Because of von Daniken I'v learned not to take such reports at face value.
B000002BDB|3.0|The four albums (well, three and a half) that trumpeter Miles Davis and arranger Gil Evans recorded together between 1957 and 1964 rank among the most celebrated works in either man's discography, and indeed they contain a wealth of fine music. They were and remain, however, carefully rendered studio sculptures, pared down from many hours' worth of recordings deemed unworthy of release at the time by the principals, whose judgment we should certainly note even if we choose to ignore it, as Columbia Records has repeatedly done (for better and worse) in assembling and releasing its ongoing series of \\"complete\\" Miles Davis boxed sets. <br />   Miles' and Gil's COMPLETE COLUMBIA STUDIO RECORDINGS was, of course, the very first of these packages, and as such it has served as the mould for all of the expertly remastered, tastefully packaged and extensively annotated boxes which have followed over the past decade. No doubt about it: it's a first-class piece of work. The trouble, alas, is the music itself, which in this case really does disprove the old adage about too much never being enough. Stunning as they frequently are in their own right, these precisely orchestrated, heavily arranged pieces don't lend themselves particularly well to alternate versions and outtakes; and with nearly three whole CDs (each the length of two full albums) devoted to material from the single LP MILES AHEAD, monotony is a powerful presence in this box. <br />   Fortunately, MILES AHEAD - as well as PORGY & BESS, SKETCHES OF SPAIN and QUIET NIGHTS - can be easily obtained by itself with the same wonderful sound and even a few of the bonus tracks included herein; and unless you're utterly fascinated by the long, slow process through which albums are - or at least were - assembled, that would probably be the better way to go. Kudos to Columbia for its fine Miles boxes (all of which started here) nevertheless!
B000002UAI|5.0|...because it felt like it predicted that I'd be listening to the cd someday.  I'm referring to the line \\"The kids of AD 2000 will draw from the music much the same sense of well being and warmth that we do today.\\"  Now I admit that I was 18 in 2000 so I guess I technically missed the literal kid description by a year, but the more general prediction of the inter-generational, timeless appeal of the Beatles was right on.  I didn't see them on the Ed Sullivan show.  I was born almost twelve years after they broke up, and about a year after the tragic shooting of John Lennon.  But I, like many, many other people born too late to have experienced Beatlemania as it was occuring, have since become a huge fan of all their work. <br /> <br />This album has my favorite of all the Beatle's songs:  I'll Follow The Sun.  That song alone is worth the five stars, but thankfully the rest of the album is great too.  This album gets a little bit too much grief, and it may not be quite as amazing as something like Abbey Road, but it's still better than just about anything else out there.
B000059S9D|5.0|I am simply blown away that this band can continue to release the calibre of music they do so consistantly! I actually don't remember the order in which I purchased this CD ,but it is definitely one of my favorites. I understand that some of the older fans became upset when SW switched to shorter, more melody- oriented songs (much as I did with the great group YES.)But I've had no problem listening to ANY music this group has made, starting from IN Absentia and Deadwing back through the whole catalog. Everything Porcupine Tree has produced has been of the utmost quality and just plain enjoyable to listen to, or should I say experience. This album reminds me of Sgt. Peppers in a darker sort of vein. Every song is a winner, tells a story, invokes emotion, strikes certain nerves, you name it..... As I said, this music is something to experience, not casually listen to. There are some Pink Floyd- type atmospherics, but I just don't feel that \\"angry\\" vibe I felt listening to later Pink Floyd. And maybe that's the similarity I'm talking about with Sgt. Pepper's. Taking simple, everyday situations and turning them into delightful, other-worldly events. You just have to try this one. You won't regret it!
B0002W4SWC|5.0|Bridget Jones's Diary is my favorite film by Renee Zellweger, I love her acting, she is so vulnerable and real. This movie is such a cute, smart, and hilarious romantic comedy. Hugh Grant and Colin Firth are great in their roles as they both try to win the affections of the nicely plump Bridget Jones. Zellweger reportedly gained over 20 pounds to play Bridget (she looks even more ample in the sequel), her body looks actually healthy to me then how Zellweger normally looks in real life. Anyways besides the weight gain this movie is so cool. My favorite scene is when she runs after Firth's character in her leopard knickers, so funny! I also recommend the sequel as well, just as good as the original. Bridget Jones is the sexiest ninny in the world, keep on sista!
B000EULJLU|1.0|What happened to these guys?<br /><br />  My opinion may be a little biased seeing as i am just not into them anymore.  It's hard to follow up an album like AEnima.  SO naturally i was very dissapointed in Lateralus.  I had some high hopes for 10,000 days but  no good.  I like Lateralus better..  All the senseless filler they do now, every song has to be 10 minutes long and they have to throw in as many parts and tempos and time signatures into one song as they can..  The result is just a bland blend of prog rock.  I haven't been able to stand Maynard since Perfect Circle, the music is just too much..  Hooker With a P+nis off of Aenima was great.  Heavey hook, solid length and a great song.  Now, they are just trying to pull off the AEnima production with lower quality hooks and songs... Tool's gone, forget about them.<br /><br />Oh and thanks guys! see you in another 7 years.
B00005JNDZ|5.0|Bridget Jones - The Edge of Reason is a great follow-up to the surprise box office hit, Bridget Jones's Diary. Only Renee Zellweger can play this role, she is wickedly fabulous as larger than life Bridget. Renee looks adorable all chubby and curvy, she is too thin in real life, I like her body in these movies. The second one is just as good as the first one. Bridget gets herself arrested and still has boyfriend trouble but this time with new beau, Mark played by Colin Firth. Hugh Grant returns to his role of Daniel Cleaver, he is even a bigger wanker in this one, I love to hate him. I love the scene where Bridget thinks she is pregnant ( funny dream sequence!). The Edge of Reason is a strong sequel, I have seen a lot of sequels and this one is pretty great.
B000E8NQU4|5.0|Besides the remastering, fans of the band will be most interested in the bonus tracks on the initial 5 Moody Blues reissues. \\"Lost Chord\\" does well in this department, especially with the instrumental version of \\"Visions of Paradise' which pre-dates new age music by over a decade. This track alone makes one realize how good this band was and one wonders what this band could have produced if it followed this direction more purposefully.  <br />Another standout bonus track is the version of \\"Simple Game\\" sung by Justin Hayward. Hayward intereperts the verses a tad differently than the previously released version, making this quite unique from the released version. As good as this version is, Mike Pinder sings more forcefully on his composition. Pinder's version is added as a bonus track also. <br />Oddly enough, tracks recorded around the time of \\"Lost Chord\\", \\"King and Queen\\" and \\"What Am I Doing Here\\" are added as bonus tracks, but \\"Gimme Little Something\\" does not appear. (These are all available on \\"Prelude\\" and \\"Caught Live +5\\"-the version of \\"What Am I Doing Here\\" differs however.) <br />Other treats include a longer version of \\"Om\\" that ends with an extended acapella chorus, and an extended \\"Best Way to Travel.\\" <br />Not to nag but- As excellent as this release is, one wonders why the 1968 period Coke commercial couldn't have been added? <br />
B00006CXXU|5.0|I am quite surprised because there is no Christina Aguilera - Stripped:Limited Edition CD/DVD Combo in your store. I was really lucky because I've got it from the music store nearby my hometown. It's an imported cd/dvd. The Cd is nothing different with the other worlwide released but I've got a bonus dvd which contains 9 of Christina Aguilera Video such as Genie in The Bottle, What A girl Want,Come On Over,I turn To You, Dirty (Uncensored Version), Beautiful, Fighter, Cant Hold Us Down and The Voice Within. Christina have changed herself from an ordinary teenage girl singer like Britney Spears to a beautiful butterfly diva like Mariah Carey.Christina prooved that she's the best. I dared and sorry for Britney's fan to say that Christina is millions better than Britney. Christina is ahead than Britney with this album. Get this edition guys if you are great fan of Christina Aguilera. I believe you won't regret.
B0000931QA|5.0|OK, yeah, so I reviewed this already, but that was a stupid as s review. Well, maybe it was not that bad but my views on it have changed, so I must rewrite it.    For those who don't know, Queensryche is an American band from Seattle that fuses power metal (Iron Maiden) with prog rock (Pink Floyd), but it sounds nothing like grunge and it doesn't have cheesy vocals and Helloween-esque dungeons and dragons lyrics. Their 3rd album 'Operation: Mindcrime' (1988) is simply one of the best albums ever and my review title is no exaggeration, this stands as the best album I've ever heard. When it comes to a concept album, this is by far the best ever put out. Yes, it's even better than 'The Wall', 'Tommy' and 'Scenes From A Memory'. This has everything a rock/metal fan could ask for; superb vocals, musicianship that doesn't fail to impress, thrashy and speedy moments and even ballads. Sure, it's not very heavy and not very technical either. But that's not what matters here. What really matters here is the depth of the songs. Although don't get me wrong, I do appreciate techincal skill (that's why Dream Theater is one of my favorite bands), and I also like listening to technical music yet brutal (ex. Cryptopsy's 'None So Vile', Morbid Angel's 'Covenant' and Slayer's 'Reign in Blood'). Geoff tate is one of the best songwriters ever (with all the help of Chris DeGarmo), and is an amazing vocalist. Aside from his great voice he has ability to hold high notes and switch from a high shriek to a low growl (NOT a death metal growl), much like The Air Raid Siren. And the musicianship, while not that technical, does go perfectly with the vocals, what makes it a PERFECT album with no single boring moment. EVERY second of the whole hour it takes is just perfect. There is no filler to be found here. Every song here gets at least a 10 out of 10. The album also tells a story (duh, it's a concept album). I agree with other reviewers who said this is the besr story to be told an a CD. The main character is Nikki, a drug addict who seeks help, then meets Dr. X who brainwashes him and orders him to kill a politician and an ex-wh ore called mary. The rest you'll figure out. Anyway I'll go through my favorite songs.    After a short introduction (I Remember Now) the album starts with an instrumental (Anarchy X) that goes into 'Revolution Calling' which is my favorite song on the album, it has a very catchy chorus and an incredible solo in the beginning. Then come the title track which is another one of my favorite songs. 'Speak' has an Iron Maiden-ish opening riff with creepy vocals an in all is another good song. 'Spreading the Disease' has a great drum sound and vocals. 'The Mission' is the best ballad on the album, it starts soft with a phone ring, but during the chorus it becomes heavier. 'Suite Sister Mary' is the longest song on the album as well as the darkest song on the album. And also consist awesome female vocals, and Geoff Tate is like one BMF here. The comes the much maligned 'The Needle Lies', it is the heaviest song on the album, the guitars here kinda remind 'Freewheel Burning' by Judas Priest, don't skip this one. 'Electric Requiem' and 'Breaking the Silence' while not my favorite songs are still superb tracks. 'I Don't Believe in Love' is the best song between TNL and EOAS. Then there are 2 skits, 'Waiting for 22' and 'My Empty Room' which lead into perhaps one of the best hard rock songs ever, 'Eyes of A Stranger'. This one left me speechless when I first heard it, it ias one of the best album closers ever. No words can describe this song.    Now this 2002 remaster has even sharpened the sound so I even recommend this over the original record.    I guess I won't go on anymore, I can't really do this masterpiece justice. It's just unbelievely good. If you are a rock/metalhead you MUST have this in your collection.
B000002U82|5.0|.....when he made the comment that \\"Microsoft doesn't have to fail in order for Apple to succeed\\".  In a sense, this is most analogous with David Gilmour and Roger Waters when it comes to the legacy of Pink Floyd.  In the most basic of assessments and the barest of critiques, the whole is greater than the sum of its parts and, regardless of the divide between the Gilmour and the Waters \\"camps\\", let's appreciate the genius and the sonic resonance that was created by the union of Gilmour, Waters, Mason and Wright.  After all, Roger Waters said it best when he described the creation of the \\"Dark Side of the Moon\\" as an \\"expression of political, philosophical and humanitarian empathy that was desperate to get out.\\"  Putting all differences aside, our world would be that less appealing had David Gilmour and Roger Waters not been able to harness the musical creativity that drove them apart.....much like Mozart and Soliere.  History will teach us nothing if we don't learn from our mistakes.....
B00005K3NR|5.0|Other than Delores Claiborne, I still think Carrie is the best adaptation of a Steven King novel.  The diary format of the book is shelved for straight narrative and it is beautifully told and brilliantly cast.  Spacek and Laurie deservedly received Oscar nominations, Allen, Travolta. Irving and Soles are perfect for their parts.  Very gorey and frightening at times, it's still heartbreaking and moving at others.  This is one of DePalma's best achievements and even at its age, it's timeless.  One of the best horror flix ever.
B0002234LS|4.0|Johnny Depp stars as writer Mort Rainey living in seclusion in a lakefront residence in upstate New York after having been estranged from his wife Amy, played by Maria Bello.  Depp is licking his wounds from the discovery of his wife having an affair in a motel room with Ted Milner played by Timothy Hutton.<br /><br />The Steven King created storyline gets weird almost immediately when Depp gets an unexpected visit from Southern drawling stranger John Shooter played by John Turturro.  Turturro alleges that Depp has plagiarized a story he had written and threatens him.  In short order everything surrounding Depp begins to become destroyed.  He asks for and gets help from detective type Ken Karsch played by Charles Dutton but the tragedies keep on occuring.<br /><br />In typical King fashion, the storyline gets a jolting twist when we discover that both Depp and Turturro may not be exactly what we think they are.  \\"Secret Window\\" was an entertaining but not especially noteworthy investment of 96 minutes.
B000EULJLU|5.0|Listening to Tool requires unperturbed attention. With 10,000 Days, Tool (once again) has eluded folks who are bent upon judging music relative to specific genres &/or categorizations. An album like 10,000 Days (or any of Tool's previous compositions) are classy pieces of work. Be patient, think wide, and explore their abysmal depth. Tool make great intense/dark/intelligent music! 10,000 Days only testifies this point.    And, the generous use of Tabla (mandala) on Marie I/II, Intension and Right-in-2 is real cool. Loved the interludes too!
1594481938|3.0|It would be nice if British novelist Nick Hornby followed the advice given by one of his suicidal characters from \\"A Long Way Down\\". She says that sometimes life is so boring, seeming so pointless that you don't need much to change it, just a tiny little jiggle is enough. And a tine little jiggle in the writer's formula would be great. After publishing five books, his literature is resting in the laurels of a formula that has made him famous worldwide. One can always know what to explicit from his books. And this is a problem, actually.<br /><br />Hornby found a formula that worked and he never surprises his readers changing it. His books are funny for most of the time, but readers who are after more, won't find it here. Packed with wit, his novels are superficial and sometimes very shallow. While they were the new black it could be at least fun to read them. Now, his latest book is just more of the same. You can't see him maturing as a writer.<br /><br />His latest, \\"A Long Way Down\\", is about a group of four people that meet by chance on the top of a building on the New Year's Eve when they are trying to kill themselves. After they decide not to do it, they become friends and one changes the life of the other showing that is not that bad being alive. Anyone can see how it will end, but, for his credit, Hornby tries at least to find a creative path for his characters. On the other hand, none of them seem to be real people, and they inhabit a cotton-candy clouded world where problems are kind of funny.<br /><br />Hornby fails when he tries to create his characters. He seems to be playing the same song all over again -- the thirty something male -- even if the writer brings women to be the narrator. Each of the four people has a chance to tell their own story, therefore, the book is changing narrators all the time, but this change never seems to happen. The voice is all the same all the time, they speak different, but you feel that the voice comes from the same chords.<br /><br />It is high time Hornby has tried something different. He has potential but it has been wasted on the same thing twice, three times. He may be afraid of disappointing his audience by changing, but a little jiggle has never hurt anybody.e chords. <br /> <br />It is high time Hornby has tried something different.

B000005L86|5.0|Of all the classic Lee \\"Scratch\\" Perry produced albums of the '70s (i.e., Junior Murvins' \\"Police and Thieves,\\" Max Romeo's \\"War Inna Babylon\\"), this is hands down the best.  Believe all the hype you're reading in all the reviews on this site.  Cedric Myton's angelic falsetto, Roy Johnson's vibrant tenor, and Scratch's insane, towering production (is that the \\"Reggae Cow\\" I hear?) join together to produce an epic work.  Are you skeptical when you hear me use the term \\"epic\\" when describing a reggae CD?  Listen and you will understand.  This CD is 100% essential.  As an addendum, if this whets your appetite for more Scratch Perry, it would pay for you to track down a copy of Perry's close-second best title, the Upsetter's \\"Super Ape\\" which is, inexpicably, out of print at the time of this writing.
B0006L16N8|4.0|These guys have something to offer. X&Y has become my favorite album in 2005 and actually it still gets better and better everytime I listen to it. This CD has some amazing songs like \\"A Message\\", \\"Fix You'. It takes a little while to grow on you but once it does its a must have. They are still making the same mellow songs with deeper meanings behind the lyrics, which is one of the things I like about them. \\"Square One\\" This song starts out slow, but surprises you when it comes out with a catchy melody, and great lyrics. The vocals and band are amazing on this song. This is by far one of my favorite CD in my fairly extensive collection.So in the end, all there is to say is that Coldplay has goten better with age.
0307277674|2.0|Mildly interesting, but believe me, I could put it down, have put it down many times and don't even know if I want to finish it.  I bought it to see what all the fuss is about.  It's fiction with religious overtones.  Big whoop.  Brown isn't even a very good writer.  When I'm done with it, it's going on amazon.com.  Maybe one of the millions of people who love mediocre fiction will buy it.  I'm ashamed to say I was a sucker.
B000002KE2|5.0|This album is where doom starts.  I know the three previous were heavy as well (real heavy), but come on; Under the Sun and Cornucopia??!!  Two of the heaviest songs still to this day.  An underated & completely phenomenal album.  Doom fan looking for roots or just a metal fan in general, this is just as good as any Sabbath album.
0066620996|3.0|With all due respect to Mr. Jim Collins, what he spent 4-5 years researching and writing 200+ pages on, could have been said by an undergraduate economics major from any university off the block in less than 5 pages. <br />I started this book as an assignment for my upcoming internship in NY for IBM, and was expecting some really great concepts, kind of the ones that make you sit up and think about what is trying to be conveyed.  But the concepts presented in this book almost mock the reader's intelligence.  Neither is it an academic read, nor an intellectually promising one.  For example, if you're not going to be disciplined in your work and with the hiring of your staff, then what exactly will you be? undisciplined and expect your company to soar to new heights? The same goes for hiring the right people.  who're you gonna hire? the wrong ones? An organization doesn't actively pursue people who are not of high calibre and then pay them a salary to not do their job and much more. also, face the brutal facts? I highly doubt CEOs are acting on their whim in lalaland. We're talking about the brutal corporate america.  Things aren't hidden well and neither do people have short memories when it comes to deception and lies. <br /> <br />The only 2 concepts I thought were important were the Hedgehog Concept and the Technology Accelerators.  People (including myself) often mistake a complex plan to be the right one, and thid chapter does a good job in removing that myth.  The same goes for technology.  A new technology can temporarily make a company good, perhaps great, but it's the ability to use that technology in the right manner and in the right ways that determines it's economic growth/decline in the future. <br /> <br />Though I am new to Corporate America, there are basic concepts that I even know and understand.  Unfortunately, Mr. Jim Collins does not provide me with the challenge, nor the promising pursuit in business that I was looking for.
B0007P0LO8|1.0|How can a respected company like DG can issue a DVD with such a poor film quality?
B000AYEL6U|2.0|The BBC has done so many wonderful presentations based on classics, and they almost always do spectacular jobs: Middlemarch, Pride and Prejudice, The Way We Live Now are all wonderful pieces that convey the spirit and the sense of the novels they aim to portray.    I wish the same could be said for North and South.  Now it is a hard book to update: Mrs. Gaskell attempts to portray both the workers and the factory owners in a positive light, and I suppose that's not entierly politically correct these days.  How else can I explain that the first time we see Mr. Thornton he is beating up one of his workers?  I'm sorry, I think I missed that part of the book.    And it's just downhill from there: the changes they make waver between odd and ridiculous.  I understand that to condense a novel into a miniseries requires some serious editing, but the problems here aren't so much what they leave out but what they add in: the fist fight at the beginning, the circumstances surrounding Mr. Hale's leaving the church, Mrs. Thornton's lace being factory made (a rather important point in the book is that it is antique), the strange things that happen during Margaret's Helstone visit, Mr. Bell's fate (the biggest \\"huh?\\" of the movie)... the list goes on.  And don't even get me started about the final scene, where Margaret's behavior is EVEN WORSE than the behavior she exhibited earlier in the movie that got her into so much trouble!  Not exactly a historically accurate way for a 19th century heroine to be acting...    This wasn't exactly my favorite book of all time, though it had its charm and I enjoyed it for what it was.  I was looking forward to this movie because I assumed it would be made to the same high standards as similar movies.  But do yourself a favor: skip this movie and read the book.  It is far superior.

0201485672|1.0|I have written software for development projects for 30 years and I have managed several projects. Martin Fowler has extraordinary insight, and I enjoy reading his papers for the gems of thought I find.<br /><br />The main lesson I pick up from this book is: Break your large project into projects sufficiently small that you can sensibly abandon Refactoring for each of the small projects.<br /><br />Refactoring works well in some cases, I suppose. Refactoring works well for some people, I suppose. I'm skeptical, though. Fowler filled the book with page after page of the detailed Refactoring method applied to a problem he acknowledged as too simple for application of Refactoring. He assures us that Refactoring may overload small projects with methodology, making it unsuitable for them, and it works really well for larger projects. I suspect, however, that the burden it imposes enlarges as the job enlarges. Fowler gives me no good reason to think otherwise. If I'm to risk this methodology on a large project, I want to see it perform well on a smaller project first.<br /><br />Fowler conceives methodologies that attract zealous disciples. In the case of Refactoring, the methodology may succeed for its attractiveness rather than for its practical utility.

B000EULJLU|5.0|I don't usually review albums on Amazon, however I feel very strongly that the new record by Tool is being unfairly maligned by certian fans who don't want the band to continue evolving. When it comes to Tool, I've never got the impression that sticking with the formula was going to be an option. Seems they continue to write music for themselves, as it should be. If you wanted another Undertow, there are plenty of second rate, unimaginitive bands out there who continue to mine that formula just for you. I'm glad that Tool has continued to keep things interesting and take risks, that's what true artists do. That said, my opinion of this record the very first time I heard it was, in all honesty, somewhat disappointed. My first impression was that it sounded too `samey' in places, and in others I felt it just kind of dragged out & defocused. But because I respect this band's work so much, and because there have been many times that my initial judgement on a piece of music has been wrong, I gave it more time to open up to me. I came back to it a few times, and let it do it's work. I'm sure glad I did, because my opinion changed drastically as I suspected it would, and it's become my favorite record to listen to right now - which is what I've come to expect from this band. They write music that is deep, inobvious at first, and opens your mind over repeated listens. I can't say the same about the majority of music out there today, and even less so in this particular genre. I can only say that in order to appreciate this amazing work of art, you have to disregard your previous notions on the band's music, because it should be clear by now, these musicians do not stagnate. Those of you who dismiss this band's work without giving it time, and who come on here and `critique' by saying simply, `the album blows', well, good riddance to you. It's impossible to not consider this record an amazing accomplishment on every possible level, and I for one am grateful that these 4 guyscontinue to produce highly intelligent, inspiring music for my pleasure. The show in Oakland, as well as last time they came through town in Berkeley, Ca. were both highlights of my concert going life. I will continue to be inspired and grateful for this band, and I hope they continue to alienate those who just want them to \\"Rock\\". Sorry, but you guys are stupid beyond words.

B0002VEPRQ|5.0|I probably give too many movies five stars.  However, this movie truly deserves five stars, and probably six.  While this movie was an achievement for Disney, it would have been an achievement for any studio, winning five Oscars, another twelve awards, and another twelve nominations, which included a best actress award for Julie Andrews in her first movie appearance.<br /><br />What makes \\"Mary Poppins\\" so magical?  Certainly the production values are incredible.  Though everything was filmed on a set, the production in this two hour nineteen minute movie is crisp and tight, with every moment focused on moving the plot forward.  But the magic in this movie is the focus on the children, and the children's view of our world; they see the world as a place of magic and wonder, and we see objects and obligations.  Whose world would you rather live in?<br /><br />When children are the age of Jane and Michael Banks (Karen Dotrice and Matthew Garber), they are trying to understand the world, which can seem so confusing.  Unfortunately, their father, George W. Banks (David Tomlinson, a Disney regular who also appeared \\"The Love Bug\\" and \\"Bedknobs and Broomsticks\\"), is a banker who has forgotten what it is like to be a child.  Worse, he barely acknowledges his children at all.  The children's mother, Winifred Banks (Glynis Johns, who has made more than 90 movie and television appearances), is barely better as she focuses on the needs of society rather than those of her family.  So who is to explain to the children what is expected of them as they grow older?<br /><br />Mary Poppins magically arrives and provides the bridge between the world of adults and the world of children.  Wonderfully aided by Bert, played by Dick Van Dyke, Mary Poppins shows the children first and foremost that she understands them.  Then Mary Poppins shows Mr. and Mrs. Banks that they have forgotten how to have fun, and that they could learn much by trying to understand their children.  Lastly, Mary Poppins shows the children that their parents really are looking out for them, if they could only understand their parents.<br /><br />To make all this magic work, Disney combined animation and outstanding special effects.  Indeed, this movie won the 1965 Oscar for best visual effects.  Mary, Bert and the children gambol about an animated countryside, in a style that was used again in \\"Bedknobs and Broomsticks.\\"  There is a marvelous scene with Uncle Albert (Ed Wynn) where we see Uncle Albert is laughing so much that has floated from the earth.  Then there is the wonderful scene with chimney sweeps singing and dancing on the rooftops of London.<br /><br />This 40th anniversary edition has a second DVD that includes an incredible number of extras.  If you are not a fan of extras, these will mean little to you.  If you like extras, these are excellent, including a fifty minute documentary that helps explain how some of the scenes were filmed.<br /><br />\\"Mary Poppins\\" is not only practically perfect in every way; it is a rare movie adults and children can enjoy without provisos of any sort.  Furthermore, it is an opportunity to remind adults of a time when they too could see our world as a magical, barely understood place, and to remember that our own children still see the world that way.  Watch this one again and remember your own childhood, and relive that childhood through your own children, or perhaps grandchildren.

1573223026|5.0|I just love Nick Hornby's books. Only he could make a book about 4 people contemplating suicide funny. This book really is hilarious but has some food for thought in there too.<br /><br />Four very different people meet on top of a tall building on New Year's Eve. They all went there to jump off but of couse they don't. They form a weird sort of friendship - I say weird because they have nothing in common with each other and don't even like each other. Eventually they bond in different ways.<br /><br />I've liked Hornby's other books but I have to say this is the best - or at least tied with About a Boy. I highly recommend it.
B000056NX5|1.0|Never in my life would I have imagined that the brilliant works of Andrew Lloyd Webber and Tim Rice could be butchered in such a horrible way. <br /> <br />After seeing Cats the DvD I had high hopes. I believe the phrase being \\"let down\\" does not even begin to describe the emotion caused by this sorry excuse of a musical. <br /> <br />Everything about it, was a piss ass poor job. Jesus was fine, not good, but able, Mary also was not too bad, and King Herod, despite his brillance as an actor was terrible in this. However I think the prize definately goes out to Judas. I do believe a tap-dancing mute giraffe would have performed much better than this over-acting, deaf-toned, poor excuse for a 'performer'. Not only do I feel that I should get my money back, I feel I should be able to be given money for putting up with it as long as I did. I am honestly disgusted in how the editors didn't cut out majority of the musical. If they did so, they would have been left with possibly 15 - 20 minutes of film and it would have been passable. <br /> <br />I am literary in shock! I think I need to watch 'Cats' again and regain my love for theatre from scratch. If you love yourself and love musicals and especially Jesus Christ Superstar, I beg of you   don't even consider looking twice at this absolute rubbish since it will burn your eyes right out of your head, leaving you in much disdain, like me, and confused as how talent has been replaced with used toilet paper. <br /> <br />Thank you.
B0001BS4Q0|4.0|I've been listening to this album since the UK release, and it has yet to wear out on me. Sia's music is not for everyone; you must listen to the songs carefully to appreciate the melodies. But once grasped, these melodies are so exquisite and subtly layered that it is difficult to tire of them. The songs are understated, the vocals vulnerable with emotion, and compositions, sumptuous. What baffles me is all the attention being given to \\"Breathe Me\\", as if the rest of the album is secondary. I do not believe this to be the case at all. While \\"Breathe Me\\" is a good song, there are many others on the album that surpass it, such as \\"Sweet Potatoe\\", \\"Sunday\\", \\"Moon\\", and \\"Numb\\". This is a beautiful collection of original songs worthy of attention.
B000EGF0B4|3.0|More haunting than entertaining. I did watch it twice. Is THIS what MEN do who want to get together without their wives, or is this simply what the movie is leading us to believe is a possible reason?  First off, this is no documentary.  Secondly, it's fiction.  Third, is an explosive mix of taboo and today's political correctness.  I am left with the feeling that Broke Back Mountain is more of a fantacy.  A fantacy about a lifestyle  with a never the less realistic pattern of self destruction.
0385513755|5.0|Dan Brown's \\"The Da Vinci Code\\" (sequel to \\"Angels and Demons\\") is amazing.  I read it in about a span of four days, and I was completely hooked from the first page to the last.<br /><br />The story starts with Robert Langdon (the protagonist from \\"Angels and Demons\\"), an American Harvard symbologist, who gets called in from his hotel in Paris, France, in the wee hours of the morning to help solve the puzzle of a mysterious murder of a Louvre Museum curator.  What Robert Langdon doesn't know...is that the French Police is under the impression that the American symbologist is the murderer.  The curator happens to be the grand master of a highly secretive religious society whose duty is to guard an ancient secret.  Now that the curator and another set of members who know the secret are murdered, the secret may be lost forever...and that's where Langdon comes in.  Langdon manages to escape the Louvre with the help of the intelligent cryptologist, Sophie Neveu.  The next few hours will take him through a frantic cat-and-mouse chase through the streets of Paris, and all the way to England as he and Sophie Neveu evade the clutches of the French Police, always staying just several steps ahead.  Langdon and Sophie hurry to solve the mystery of the secret society's secret, before it is uncovered by the wrong hands.<br /><br />This illustrated version of the book helps greatly as one envisions the symbols, paintings, and sites in various parts of Europe...they're right there for you to study as you read along!<br /><br />The plot of this book moves fast, a roller coaster ride that definitely keeps your fingers itching to look ahead in the book to see what comes next.  Brown keeps the story moving along nicely, with short and to the point chapters and different points of view.  His words flow fluidly and beautifully, and at times I had to remind myself that most of this was fiction!  Expect twists and turns that will make you gape at the pages and not want to move from where you are sitting.<br /><br />This book is an amazing blend of history, conspiracy themes, and action, all in one clean and neat package!om where you are sitting. <br /> <br />This book is an amazing blend of history, conspiracy themes, and action, all in one clean and neat package!

B000EHSVOG|5.0|Irwin Allen decided to follow up his \\"The Poseidon Adventure\\" success with the 1974 suspense-thriller \\"The Towering Inferno,\\" a movie which also garnered an impressive 10 Oscar nominations and is released as a 2-disc DVD special edition this week.<br />Whereas in \\"The Poseidon Adventure\\" the leads had to travel up, the only way is down for Steve McQueen, Paul Newman, William Holden, Fred Astaire, Richard Chamberlain, Robert Wagner and Faye Dunaway. Attending the opening night gala the guests are trapped on the 129th floor of the world's tallest building which becomes an inferno thanks to the shoddy wiring system installed by chief builder James Duncan (Holden) and his electrician son Roger Simmons (Chamberlain).<br />Newman plays Doug Roberts, the proud architect behind the Glass Tower, a skyscraper, which dominates the San Francisco skyline at a height of 138-story's. Returning from a long vacation Roberts immediately recognizes that something is wrong and he is proven correct when a circuit breaker burns out and ignites garbage on a lower floor.<br />While the script can be a tad melodramatic at times, the effort put into this movie is obvious. Nominated for Best Picture and winning for best cinematography, best special effects and best song, the movie was a smash hit and still holds up well today in this age of blockbuster special effects extravaganza's.<br />As with \\"The Poseidon Adventure\\" the previous DVD release was sorely lacking in special features and has been replaced with three hours of extras. Joining the nine all-new featurettes which includes a retrospective, a look at the special effects and the art design is the AMC Backstory on the making of the movie, 32 deleted or extended scenes and an audio commentary by film historian F.X. Feeney.<br />Feeney's commentary is fascinating and comprehensive, covering all aspects of the production from the writing and dialogue all the way through to the sets and the sense of anticipation director John Guillerman builds up from the start. Feeney tells us that this movie was a milestone for Hollywood in that it was the first time two studios had co-produced a feature. Warner Bros. and 20th Century Fox owned two separate books, \\"The Tower\\" by Richard Martin Stern and \\"The Glass Inferno\\" by Thomas N. Scortia and Frank M. Robinson, and both planned to make two competing movies on the same subject.<br />It was Allen who stepped in and proposed the historic deal and the two studios agreed, splitting first the cost and then the profit equally.<br />Though not for the full length of the feature special effects director Mike Venzina and stunt coordinator Branko Racki both individually comment on individual scenes. Verzina discusses eight scenes and Racki talks about nine separate scenes. Their observations are largely technical in nature and center on their selective specialties.<br />The longest of the documentaries is once again the AMC Backstory which runs 22:08. It is in this featurette that we learn that the model used for shots of the tower was itself seven stories high, that William Holden became aggravated with Faye Dunaway's tardy-ness to the set and that despite the media attempting to portray conflict between the two stars Steve McQueen and Paul Newman, the two actually got along well together with a mutual respect and friendly competition (as evidenced by a funny blooper).<br />The other featurettes range from 4:28 in length (on the directing of the movie) to 9:15 on the writer Stirling Silliphant. But they cover a wide range of topics from a retrospective by the cast and crew \\"Inside the Tower: We Remember\\" (8:16) in which Richard Chamberlain likens the set to being at a really glamorous Hollywood party day after day with the standard six star dressing rooms being increased to 15 to the architecture of the tower in \\"Still the World's Tallest Tower\\" (8:28) which compares The Glass Tower to other real-life skyscrapers and the impact these high-rise buildings have on the surrounding communities.<br />Other topics touched on include the safety aspects employed on the production in \\"Putting out fire\\" (4:58) in which Allen comments \\"You'd better have all the camera's rolling because fire waits for no man,\\" and also reveals that firemen were on the set each day to \\"Running on fire\\" (5:52) which discusses the work of the stuntmen and includes the facts McQueen did not like anyone else doing his stunts and even Newman and Chamberlain did a number of their own stunts.<br />Also on this special collector's edition are 32 deleted or extended scenes that range from the 40-second \\"Still Waiting for the Elevator\\" which featuresshots of crowds of people pushing and shoving each other at the elevator and Holden's character assessing the situation on the telephone to the 2:55 clip \\"Four Alarm Fire\\" which covers the spreading of the fire through the building, the call from security requesting a four-alarm fire and shots of fire engines screaming through the streets of San Francisco.<br />All of the deleted or extended scenes were originally part of a longer television broadcast.

B00005JMUA|5.0|Kill Bill Volume 2 is an amazing spectacle directed by the best filmmaker in Hollywood today, Quentin Tarantino (Reservoir Dogs), and starring Uma Thurman (Pulp Fiction), David Carradine (Death Race 2000), Daryl Hannah (Wall Street), and Michael Madsen (Reservoir Dogs). <br /> <br />Kill Bill Volume 2 delivers yet another heavy dosage of blood, Samurai swords and quirky dialogue. The movie begins where Volume 1 left off: The Bride, now revealed as Beatrix Kiddo, played by Thurman, has just killed two of her former co-members in the Deadly Viper Assassination Squad: Vernita Green, played by Vivica A. Fox, and O-Ren Ishii, played by Lucy Liu. Now, Beatrix is determined to get to the leader of them all and once she does she will kill Bill, played by Caradine, but not before she confronts the one-eyed maniac Elle Driver, played by Hannah, in the most memorable fight scene of all Kill Bill films, and Bud, played by Madsen, Bill's trailer dwelling brother. Along the way, we are finally introduced to Bill (in the first Volume, Bill is heard but not seen). We're also given Bill's motives for ordering the assault on the Texas church where The Bride, her fiance and companions were brutally massacred by the DiVAS. The sequel also explores how Kiddo, or The Bride, was trained into becoming a killing machine, and, finally, introduces us to the fate of The Bride's baby and who the father is.  <br /> <br />Kill Bill Volumes 1 and 2 have been hailed by many critics as Quentin Tarantino's best work since 1994's Oscar winning Pulp Fiction. As one whole movie, Kill Bill is undeniably his bloodiest film to date, and one of the most brilliant films of the first decade of the millennium. <br /> <br />Recommended <br /> <br />A
0316172324|5.0|The author makes compelling arguments about when quick decision making--in a blink--works and when it doesn't, but he doesn't highlight them, so they're easy to miss. I suggest reading it a chapter a time. Even though it's short, give it some time for the impressions to sink in. <br /> <br />The examples and stories are stupendous. They'll stick with you. I still find myself referring to them months after I read it.
B000EULJLU|5.0|It's always a great anticipation when a new Tool album comes out and this one does not disappoint in the least.  The first 2 songs start out on an energy filled adrenaline pace then you get the balance of the more mellow but equally powerfully epic 10,000 days.  Tool albums to me are not just a bunch of songs it's an experience they are some of the only albums where you have to just sit and enjoy the entire album as a hole to appreciate it to the fullest.  Right in two is an amazing song that is one of my instant favorites great lyrics and great song.  I definitely recommend it although I imagine if you are a Tool fan you bought this album a week ago the day it came out as I did.
B000002J1S|5.0|Strange concept album that manages to capture the atmosphere with it's wonderful music. The lyrics are way out there like Amnesia of the hoax and sometimes bog down the music. The music itself is so creative and inventive that it more than makes up for the sometimes lacking gabriel and his warped lyrical banter. Of special note is the amazing Tony Banks- what a unique player. Buy this one proggers!!!

B000002LQR|5.0|I couldn't let the opportunity to post a review about THE album that made me pick up a bass guitar go by. I used to have a copy way back when until I lent it to a friend of mine (who subsequently moved and was never heard from again) I finally was able to source another copy recently. In short the album is jaw-dropping. I am hard-pressed to pick a favourite from the album, but I think Sir Psycho Sexy, Funky Monks and Give It Away will always be up there. In short, whether you play a musical instrument or not this album drags you kicking, screaming and partying through 75 minutes of pure funk/punk/rock excess and the world would not be complete without it!
B000002UAR|5.0|This is by far the best album the Beatles made (yes, even better than Abbey Road).  I personally find Sgt. Pepper's mediocre; Revolver is a million times better.  \\"Taxman\\" and \\"Eleanor Rigby,\\" well, everyone knows those.  In fact I think they're two of the worst songs on the album, which says something about how great it is!  \\"I'm Only Sleeping\\" is absolutely gorgeous.  \\"Love You To\\" is maybe my favorite George Harrison/Beatles song of all time; it really takes you to India.  \\"Here, There and Everywhere\\" is a very pretty Paul McCartney song.  \\"Yellow Submarine,\\" what is there left to be said?  You all know it already.  \\"She Said She Said\\" is a really lovely, psychedelic song that I like a lot.  Very enjoyable.  Now starts the more filler-ish section of the album... \\"Good Day Sunshine\\" and \\"And Your Bird Can Sing\\" are great but not spectacular.  \\"For No One\\" I kind of dislike, because it's so sad and minimal, but perhaps you'll like it.  \\"Doctor Robert\\" is pretty decent.  Then we get the amazing finish: \\"I Want To Tell You\\" is a catchy, great Harrison song; \\"Got to Get You Into My Life\\" is pretty neat; \\"Tomorrow Never Knows\\" is the best song after \\"Love You To\\" on here, with its trippy effects and cool, well, cool everything.<br /><br />If you want to really enjoy the Beatles, get this album.  If you didn't like the White Album and that turned you off the Beatles, get this album.  If you want something to take you away for thirty-five minutes, get this album.  Just get this album!
B00000CQJZ|5.0|1935's The 39 Steps is the film that really put Alfred Hitchcock on the map as a world-class movie director.  With its mixture of classic Hitchcockian wit, dark (and light) humor, and suspense, it brought to the fore the man's genius and set the stage for many a classic thriller to come.  Robert Donat is excellent in the role of Richard Hannay, a young Canadian who finds himself in between a rock and a hard place after his encounter with a young female spy in London, while Madeleine Carroll brings beauty, grace, and a sense of romance to Hannay's increasingly harrowing quest to not only prove himself innocent of murder but to safeguard the defense of Great Britain from foreign agents.  All he has to go on are a cryptic reference to something called \\"the 39 steps,\\" a name of a town in Scotland, and a warning to stay away from any man missing the upper digit on his right pinkie finger.<br /><br />When the mysterious Annabella Smith (Lucie Mannheim) invites herself home with him and tells him her fantastic story of intrigue and danger, Hannay doesn't quite believe her - until, that is, she turns up in the night with a knife in her back.  Knowing that the killers are waiting for him outside (and also knowing how likely the police would be to find him guilty of the murder up in his flat), he quickly adopts the classic mantle of the innocent man on the run, desperate to ultimately prove his innocence.  The journey he makes from London to a little town in Scotland is not an easy one, as Hannay finds himself running from the bad guys who want to kill him as well as the cops pursuing him for murder.  Deceit and double-crossing as well as assistance from unexpected quarters keep things very interesting - particularly after he finds himself on the run yet again (after one of several narrow escapes), now handcuffed to the lovely and initially unsympathetic Pamela (Madeleine Carroll).  The romantic element thus introduced into the film deviates from the original novel on which the screenplay was based, but it clearly strengthens the film, setting the stage for a most climactic conclusion.<br /><br />One of Hitchcock's best-known British films, The 39 Steps doesn't prove as gripping or dramatic as many of the master's later movies, but the exquisite dialogue and direction do make for some memorable moments (none more so than Hannay's improvised speech at a political meeting, which definitely qualifies as a classic in my book), and the twists and turns along the way continuously ratchet up the suspense, with everything working in concert toward a finish that does not disappoint.ch the screenplay was based, but it clearly strengthens the film, setting the stage for a most climactic conclusion. <br /> <br />One of Hitchcock's best-known British films, The 39 Steps doesn't prove as gripping or dramatic as many of the master's later movies, but the exquisite dialogue and direction do make for some memorable moments (none more so than Hannay's improvised speech at a political meeting, which definitely qualifies as a classic in my book), and the twists and turns along the way continuously ratchet up the suspense, with everything working in concert toward a finish that does not disappoint.
0375707972|2.0|I've read a few books about the Holocaust but always from the Jewish point of view; never one from a German point of view after the war. This book focused on the German guilt after the WWII for the next generation of German children.  I gave this book a two because while I felt the topic was interesting, I also thought the writing was too choppy (probably something lost in the translation).<br /><br />I also felt little for the characters of Hanna and Michael.  It wasn't just the fact that I didn't like or dislike the characters, but I also didn't understand them.  I felt the writer could have given a little more detail about Hanna's past in the concentration camp and the trial.  It was also hard to understand how the relationship between Hanna and Michael even started.<br /><br />While a portion of this novel did focus on the Nazi crimal trial of Hanna and 4 other female guards, the majority of this novel centered around Hanna and Michael's relationship.  The guilt, confusion, and hurt feelings Michael had over Hanna leaving continued into his relationships during his teenage years, his young adult life, and into his forties.  It was an incredibly sad story because no character ever seemed happy or complete.<br /><br />I think I would like to continue to read novels about the after effects of the Holocaust both from the perspective of Germans and Jews but perhaps novels that focus more on historical facts.
B000EULJLU|5.0|I'm not sure I quite understand the negative reviews of this album.  Let's go back for a moment to some of the Aenima shows before Tool went on hiatus.  In these shows they tried something I never thought they would do (taking the lyrics of Hush as a reference): they edited themselves when playing the song Jerk Off live.  Tool edited themselves, I thought?  Not possible. <br /> <br />But it was.  Tool (and Maynard specifically I imagine) was becoming aware that their catharsis of anger could lead to violence.  They were coming of age, hitting the point where they couldn't keep making the same angry music over and over. <br /> <br />Lateralus saw Tool making their first large strides toward intentionally not being the angry band they were once known for.  In fact, there is only one directly angry song on the album.  Instead, they pulled towards a sort of pedagogic explanation of responsibility and moral standards (both internal and external).  As with each Tool album, it was an experiment. <br /> <br />10,000 Days shows Tool further down the line.  More dextrous as players and more subtle as song writers.  Gone are the snide comments and (potentially overly-)moralist sentiments.  Gone also are the licks that take a couple minutes to master.   <br /> <br />It's not the kind of album that will pick you up and bang you around.  It gives you a little of that, but then moves into something deeper, something that tries to get at the layers beyond aggression.  Sure, they could have made an entire album of hairpoint turns and complicated percussion at full volume, but then it wouldn't be Tool.  This album is as much about being dynamic (in ranges of emotion as well as ranges of seriousness) as it is about acute lyrics or jaw-dropping technicality. <br /> <br />I say give it time, and if nothing else, keep it in your collection and listen to it months from now.  The material Maynard chose to wrestle with in this one isn't easy to come at, and it doesn't give you a lot of ground to feel holier-than-thou (like previous albums could be used to).    As such, it may take some time to warm up to.
B000EULJLU|5.0|This album is infectious.  There are references to all the previous tool work, but the songs are new, they are long and intricate.  There is not heavy hit-after-hit like Aenima, but this one stomps much heavier than their epic Lateralus.  Justin's basswork is even more solid, and Adam is up to his usual antics, but playing faster and with more lead.  Joe Barresi has gotten a much thicker, better sound.  Highlight track: Jambi.  I can't believe the average rating is **** out of 5.  That's what Godsmack and Audioslave's latest albums got.  These three albums are equally crafted and satisfying?  I'm glad we all review fairly here on Amazon--thanks to everyone for making the numbers meaningless.  This is album of the year, the rest are crud.
B000E5N62U|5.0|The world is a much better place because of Donald Fagan... The voice... The funk... The lyrics... The mind... I welcome a new project from Donald Fagen (or Steely Dan for that matter) like a letter from an old friend that isn't always in communication, but when they are, it's moving.  MORPH THE CAT is in power rotation on my iPod!
B00005JKQZ|5.0|This resulted in four well-deserved Academy Awards in 2002: Best Picture for Brian Grazer and the people at Imagine Entertainment, Ron Howard for his direction, Jennifer Connelly for her supporting role, and Akive Goldsman for his script adapted from Sylvia Nasar's biography.  It is a beautiful and touching movie, uplifting and full of a lot of things that Hollywood does very well.<br /><br />Russell Crowe is believable as the arrogant yet vulnerable mathematician John Nash who fell into paranoid schizophrenia while an undergraduate at Princeton University.  A philandering and selfish man who is paradoxically almost as lovable as Albert Einstein, Nash can also be humble and exhibit a wry, self-effacing sense of humor.  To me he is a great hero, not because of his work in Game Theory for which he was awarded the Nobel Prize in Economics, but because he is one of the very few people ever to conquer, as it were, schizophrenia.<br /><br />In the outstanding documentary from The American Experience PBS series, \\"A Brilliant Madness\\" (2002) Nash explains how he did it: he just stopped listening to the voices.  The voices that the paranoid schizophrenic hears are inside his head and they are amazingly persuasive; the delusions are as compelling as monstrous personages come to life, vivid, demanding, in many ways more \\"real\\" than the reality we normally experience.  So it really was heroic of John Nash to come to grips with his delusions and to mentally shove them aside.  The vast majority of paranoid schizophrenics can never do that.<br /><br />Yet the movie merely resembles his life and his singular experience.  Goldsman's script and Howard's direction take the life of John Nash and distill the essence of his triumph while brushing aside many of the unpleasant and non-heroic details.  I don't object to this because this movie is clearly aimed at the widest possible audience, and I appreciate the wisdom of that approach.  But for those of you interested in a more comprehensive and objective picture of the man I can recommend both the documentary mentioned above and Nasar's biography.  I especially found it valuable to view the one-hour documentary because to actually see the man and to hear him speak allowed me to better appreciate the fine performance by Russell Crowe.<br /><br />I found Jennifer Connelly absolutely mesmerizing as Alicia (not to mention gorgeous).  Ed Harris was a hardcore graphic nightmare as the unrelenting Parcher while Paul Bettany was intriguing and clever as Nash's nonexistent buddy.  Howard's direction not only got excellent work from everybody, but he was able to bring the pathos and exhilaration of Nash's life to the audience in a very satisfying way emotionally.  If you can watch this without shedding a tear or two you may want to check your synaptic connections.  Incidentally the makeup work on Crowe and Connelly to allow us the illusion of the passing years was outstanding (and got an Oscar nomination).<br /><br />The key to the movie and to Howard's vision is the way that the real world and the Nash's delusional world are meshed.  It's clear he wanted to compel the audience to share the paranoid schizophrenic experience.  While not a paranoid schizophrenic myself I have known people who are, and I have had similar, limited experiences myself under certain, shall we say, circumstances.  The sheer terror that can sometimes be felt came through in the car chase scene (yes, Howard managed to get one in) while Nash's obsessive energy was revealed on the walls of the rooms that he had completely covered with pages from magazines that he had frantically searched looking for secret Soviet codes.<br /><br />Some quibbles: while undergraduates loved beer then as they do now, they did not in 1946 go out for pizza, and if they had they would have called it \\"pizza pie.\\"  There were no pizza parlors and no pizza at the market.  If you went to an Italian restaurant you had spaghetti or ravioli, and the pizza that was served was mostly bread with a thin topping of cheese and sauce, nothing like the great thin platters we have today.<br /><br />New Zealander Russell Crowe's West Virginia accent faded in some scenes only to return strong in another.  Incidentally he is not to be confused with Cameron Crowe, who wrote the script for Fast Times at Ridgemont High (1982) and directed such films as Jerry Maguire (1996) and Almost Famous (2000).  Russell Crowe has starred in a number of excellent movies including Proof (1991), LA Confidential (1997), The Insider (1999), etc.<br /><br />Also, no mention in the movie is made of Nash's homosexual experiences nor of his running away to Europe or his desire to renounce his US citizenship.  I understand that Howard decided to leave out the homosexual angle because associating homosexuality with schizophrenia would open a can of worms that would detract from the theme of the movie.  Also left out was Nash's other paternity with a woman he never married.<br /><br />Nash is not a saint, but he is a hero, and this beautiful movie is a fine tribute to him and his accomplishments.a that was served was mostly bread with a thin topping of cheese and sauce, nothing like the great thin platters we have today. <br /> <br />New Zealander Russell Crowe's West Virginia accent faded in some scenes only to return strong in another.

B00005RHF8|1.0|Jane Eyre Starring George C. Scott and Susannah York has all the potential of being an excellent movie. I truly believe that if the ORIGINAL UNEDITED version were allowed to surface and produced by a reputable company, this would be a 5 star movie.  If George C. Scott knew what this Farce of a reproduction company has done to this movie, he would surely turn over in his grave, rise up and haunt the dickens out of them!
B000083C49|5.0|Two Discs packed with entertainment information, and an extremely good time.  Nicholas Meyer wrote part of this Film, and despite that short coming, :-), it is great; you get to discover which parts he wrote too !!! And surprise, surprise, both Meyer and Shatner  agree on one thing, the use of Time Travel as a device is not that great. However, its very good fun in this film.  Nimoy once again shows his brilliance as a director in what I believe is his third directorship, and maybe fourth( but not in thje STAR TREK Universe). He correctly picks some significant changes in the stories edge, and manages to safely create one of the most popular films in the STAR TREK film series.  The features on disc 2 are brilliant, and the detailed Tribute to Mark Lenard  is awesome !!! Some of the discussions may be a bit too much for some, but the loads of extras is more than enough to justify the cost, even with the disc one audio and video quality, as well as a DVD  menu that is way better than STAR TREK VI ( the only  other one in this series I have seen so far), the icing is on the cake.
B00006469V|5.0|I have owned the 1962 Bayreuth performance conducted by Knappertsbusch for twenty years and one cannot help noticing, especially as compared to the Decca version, the disadvantages of the Festpielhaus's covered pit: loss of high frequencies and orchestral colour and restricted dynamic range so that the experience is less moving and thrilling than Solti's version. If only I had bought it earlier! In every way it is outstanding: no expense was spared to get the best possible cast, down to Kiri Te Kanawa as one of the Flower Maidens. The Vienna Boys' Choir is also striking in the Temple scenes. The recording is vintage Decca with orchestra and singers perfectly balanced and with plenty of depth of perspective so that one has the impression of watching a stage performance.<br />Solti and the Vienna Philharmonic are wonderful throughout, ecstatically uplifting, and Solti knows just how to pace this work so that it never once hangs fire not even during Gurnemanz's monologues (Gottlob Frick must of course take a lot of credit too); indeed, the opera seems amazingly short (and there is nothing longer or more tedious than a bad \\"Parsifal\\"). Solti also brings out more orchestral detail and colour than most, maintaining constant interest and fascination. One is left wondering if this isn't after all Wagner's masterpiece. Certainly I have never heard a performance to match this one.
B00005M91K|4.0|This was a lovely film, no doubt about that. I'm in agreement with most of the reviews here. BUT, can we please note that the huge continent known as Africa was barely represented. I don't know if it had to do with licensing or travel or politics or what? But I fined the fact that only the Massi (and they barley got any attention) and Egypt were the only representations that I saw. This film is being toted as a film that graces the entire world and that is a very inaccurate statement given that Africa is barely given a nod. <br /> <br />That said, it's a given that this film is not what most people are used to. But should all films BE what we are used to? Come on.  <br /> <br />I highly recommend this film because it forces you to slow down. Contemplate spirituality from a broad (though not fully inclusive) perspective. And it's gorgeously shot. Yes, it may be a little difficult to get into but not all good things are easy. In the end, it's very very very worth it.  <br />
B000EHRVP6|1.0|I will be brutally honest with you. I hated the movie. I'd been told that it was a 'must see', but I wouldn't recomend it to just anyone. If you go for the mindless violence and torture thing, then by all means, go buy this movie, you'll love it.<br /><br />Storyline? Not bloody likely. The storyline as I saw it was this: Go to Europe, get laid, get drunk, get tortured. Yeah, that's how the movie goes.<br /><br />It's these two friends that go to Europe on break, looking for a good time. In one of the countries they visited, they met this thrid guy that agreed to show them around Europe. So now we have three guys, going to all these European countries, looking for one thing: A good time.<br /><br />They get a tip off about a place where the women go insane for American blood, and they head on down there, to a town/place called Hostel. Hence the name of the movie. While there, the meet some people, mostly women. Then out of the blue (or so it seems), their European friend just up and disappears with an Asian female, leaving them alone.<br /><br />That is the beginning of a downward spiral of insanity. People seem to be just up and checking out of the hotel left and right, then the Americans get split up, and one of them is abducted.<br /><br />He wakes up in a dark room and a bright new world of pain. The American tourist is being tortured by some rich guy that can't figure out a better way to spend a couple grand and an hour of his life.<br /><br />The guy's best friend somehow gets taken to the place where his friend is being held and is the knock out cold. He also wakes up later on to his own little world of agony.<br /><br />The whole point of this movie is pain and torture.<br /><br />I do not recomend it, although maybe it's just that I wasn't in the right mood when I saw it.<br /><br />I wish I had never bought it...
B0007GAEW6|3.0|I'm hardly prog-averse, and I'm always up for listening to a great drummer, which the guy in this band certainly is. And Mars Volta is probably the tightest band around right now, but what they lack next to the bands they're often compared to - Yes, Led Zeppelin, and even Rush (who I don't particularly like) - is songwriting. There's scantly a hummable melody on this entire unfocused mess of an album, just a lot of minor-key intense jamming, like a darker Grateful Dead (except, again, without the songs). The band shifts dynamics often and yet does so in a totally boring and predictable jammy way (louder, louder, LOUDER LOUD LOUD! LOUD! LOUD LOUD! Loud loud softer softer softer softer...), and Cedric's impressive vocal theatrics never seem to hit any sweet notes but rather just meander around in a blues scale -- the typical fallback of a vocalist who, again, can't write melodies. Get these guys a songwriter though and they'll be the best band in the world.
B00005JNTX|3.0|In Sin City you will get to see violence in such an explicit way, it isn't shocking anymore. After a couple of action scenes <br />with Mickey Rourke you'll just look at the violence as if it is fun like Tom and Jerry. When you reach that mood the cartoon based movie is definetely nice to watch, especially with so many colourful characters being there. However Sin City should <br />have been at least 30 minutes shorter as Rodriguez needs to use his brilliant trick with the violence for 3 story lines. After the second story line his trick I would have liked to see something else, but this is where the movie let me dow a little. (SARR) <br /> <br />
B000078DOH|5.0|I first bought this on a cassette back in 1985 when it was released.  I wore the tape out.  Yes, enough playing can do that.  I first hear the single \\"Jungleman\\" on an independant radio station.  I am disappointed that there are other review on here that compare this tape, album, cd, mp3 to anything current by the RHCP.  Does any band sound the same as they did 20 years ago?  Would they still share the same success if they did.  I agree that there is a heavy funk vibe to this cd.  I agree that George Clinton might have influenced the band a bit more then another producer might.  But it was the 80's and it was a largly trasitional time for music.  Name another time that rap, funk, disco, rock, pop, new wave, metal, glam, goth, punk and dance shared popularity prior to the 80's. This is a gem of an album which gives you an idea of the roots of the band.  RHCP have continued with the funk.  In this album they discovered it.  A must have for anyone who is a fan.
B000ETQRCM|5.0|To be perfectly honest, I didn't really think that I was going to buy this album. A few weeks back I won a gift certificate to Wal-Mart that I hadn't used. Since Wal-Mart's selection of discount DVD's and music sucks, there wasn't really anything that I felt I wanted. Also, since there isn't anything coming out anytime soon that I want (Stadium Arcadium, uh...no), I decided to buy this CD along with the new Tool cd to dispose of the gift card.  <br />I'm not a real big pearl jam fan. I have Rearviewmirror, but no other albums, and the single \\"World Wide Suicide\\" wasn't exactly blowing me away, but as soon as I popped this disc in I fell in, I was very happy that I had bought it. I'm not the first person to say that this album revisits the band's early sound, and it's great.  <br /> <br />It's still too early to judge this album, but for the moment, I am happy that I took the chance on it. <br /> <br />Good tracks: Life Wasted, World wide Suicide (which grew on me), severed hand, Marker in the Sand, and Unemployable.
B000028U0Y|5.0|I only learned about this cd through the film- what a find. It is so electric and incredible. I highly recommend.
B00005JKG7|5.0|AMAZING!! This is one of those scary movies that brings the horror movie to a new meaning. What I enjoyed about the FOG was that the `scary' part is brought into the movie through suspense, music and so on without using useless bloody/guts scenes like in the modern horror movies. Also this is one of the only scary movies who freak you out from the first second until the rolling credits. For horror/scary movie fans a must see
B000DZIGDU|4.0|The movie was sort of a cross between M*A*S*H and Saving Private Ryan.  Parts were funny and light, parts were quite difficult to watch.  The characters were developed enough to cause the viewer to care, but not so much that we didn't wonder more about them.  Well done.
6301777387|1.0|This movie glorifies sexual harrassment, homophobia, and adultery. \\"Trapper\\" and \\"Hawkeye\\" are the film's heroes, who are constantly sexually berating nurses. In one scene, \\"Hot Lips\\" is exposed while take a shower to the entire camp. She helplessly crawls away naked, screaming, while the entire camp laughs and jeers at her. How can that be funny? This scene was boderline rape.    This movie was created by 60's counter-culture Hollywood to expose the horrors of the Vietnam war. That was accomplished, but the movies' creators exposed themselves as selfish, immoral, and hatefully disrespectful of women.
044024157X|4.0|This is the first time I have read a book by John Grisham and I think that this one was AMAZING.  It takes you on a wild adventure from the eyes of a newspaper owner by the name of William Traynor. He winds up meeting new friends Miss Callie and Harry Hex. As a murder unfolds in this town he must recount all the news and other things going on in the town. But soon the jurors are all dying one by one by an anyonimous killer. Now he has to cope with more murders and the saftey of his friends. I think that this is a great book and I would recomend it to anyone in the feeling for an exciting book full of murder and deseption.
B000F0UV0E|5.0|Don't listen to the clips of these songs. Listen to the CD. I saw this at the store and said, \\"Why not?\\" Tonight, I'm listening for the first time. I haven't smiled for months. Tonight, I'm smiling. Mr. Knopfler... I'm so jealous. You had the good fortune to sing with an angel. I'm in love.
B000000I0I|5.0|Released in 1975, the haunting Ommadawn is an excellent recording and the last of the trilogy that featured album-length works including Tubular Bells (1973) and Hergest Ridge (1974).  All three of these albums can be purchased in one shot with the \\"Boxed\\" package.  Of the three albums, Ommadawn is a personal favorite.<br /><br />Mike Oldfield is quite the multi-instrumentalist and on Ommadawn plays everything from acoustic/electric guitar, to bass, to (tons of) synthesizers (amongst other instruments), including a brief vocal passage on Ommadawn Part Two (he sings quite well).  In addition to the wide range of instruments Mike plays, he is joined by Irish musician and Chieftains leader Paddy Maloney (pipes); Mike's sister Sally and Irish singer Clodagh Simmons (vocalese passages); Leslie Penning (recorder); a team of excellent African drummers (Jabula); and most notably, virtuoso Gong drummer/percussionist Pierre Moerlen.  Unfortunately, Pierre is not allowed to rip it up on the kit and simply contributes percussion bits here and there.  The way I see it, a full drum kit, especially when handled by a master percussionist like Pierre Moerlen, could have added another (dynamic) dimension to this recording.<br /><br />This should not imply that this album is dull or one-faced.  On the contrary, it is richly textured instrumental music with touches of progressive rock here and there and a great deal of traditional English folk music.  I should note that although the term \\"world music\\" was used in the liner notes to describe the album, I do not feel that it is appropriate here, given the emphasis on European melodies, harmonies, and rhythms.  Mike has a good handle on melodies and they are both abundant and haunting.  He also knows how to put a large piece together, and the two works, including Parts One (19'14\\") and Two (17'17\\") flow along very smoothly, develop nicely, and more than hold my interest.  Mike also has a sense of humor and there are (exceptionally) brief passages that are bouncier and lighter than the rest of the music, which is largely brooding and contemplative.<br /><br />This remastered album was transferred using HDCD technology and the sound is incredible with deep rich bass and crisp treble.  I would have liked to see more in the way of liner notes and photos, but we can't always get what we want.  All in all, this is a pleasant instrumental album that is recommended along with Hergest Ridge.rief passages that are bouncier and lighter than the rest of the music, which is largely brooding and contemplative. <br /> <br />This remastered album was transferred using HDCD technology and the sound is incredible with deep rich bass and crisp treble.

B000F0UV0E|4.0|.... yeah, and if there is a more perfect match in the pure musicality of this release, it would only be in Emmy Lou's pairings with Neil Young. The story here is that these two have been planning on collaborating for a decade or more and finally got it all focused for this effort. It's terrific. I happen to like K's RAGPICKER\\"S DREAM and Harris's WRECKING BALL more, but that's quibbling. Here the Notting Hillbilly and the Sweetheart of the Rodeo combine to pressent a set of songs that will carry you away. All of K's best traits are on display: the fretwork, the odd stories in the songs, the low grumble of his baritone. Harris, well, is there a finer singer around? <br />She brings a level of grace to every project, even with a toad like Costello, she raises the quality of an endeavour to a shimmering level. Emotion, passion, depth, she has it all in spades, and apart from either Young or Parsons, I can't think of a better vocal pairing than with K.  <br />As a record, this hasn't the devastating song cycle of Harris's STUMBLE INTO GRACE. But you can't do that every time out anyway. What's key to this is that the collection picks up where The Notting Hillbillies left off, as worthy a side project as The Travelling Willburys. To that end, K delivers a Brit's take on roots americana, with the added dimension of Harris's authenticity. You will continue to listen to this for a very long time. Much has been made of the solo on the last cut. I'm not as impressed, not that there's a thing wrong with it, but you have to remember \\"Brothers In Arms,\\" \\"Cal,\\" Local Hero,\\" among others. In any case, this is a terrific release that will hopefully keep Knopfler from feeling he has to generate another money for nothing. This one is on the money.
B000EULJLU|5.0|The painfully long five year wait is over. And WOW was it ever worth it. Tool's new album 10,000 Days was released yesterday. I previewed the album last night all the way through, and then went and listened to a few of the songs that really stood out for me again. I liked them even more the second time around. As usual, Tool have created a piece of work that gets better each time you listen to it. I told my wife last night, I feel Tool is the only band I can think of that has legitimately gotten better with each consecutive release. There isn't a band out there I can name that betters themselves with each release. <br /> <br />The album starts off with \\"Vicarious\\". It's a great opening track that really sets the tone of the album. It reminds me of \\"Intolerance\\" from \\"Undertow\\" in the arrangement. Adam Jones talked about the fact that he used a talk box on the album in an interview with Guitar World that I read on my flight to Atlanta. He employs it in the second track \\"Jambi\\", which is deliciously heavy. I cannot tell you guys how great that one sounds on my stereo when I have it turned up nice and loud.   The next two tracks sealed the deal for me. Track three is \\"Wings For Marie (PT1)\\"  which is very mellow. It meshes into what I can tell you right now is not only the BEST song Tool has ever written, but one of the best songs I've ever heard in my life, period. It's the title track \\"10,000 Days (Wings PT2)\\" and the dynamics in this song are nothing short of amazing. It builds up to an absolutely orgasmic finish, and is worth the price of the album by itself. I'm telling you this right now, Tool have written their \\"Stairway To Heaven\\", and it is this song. I listened to it three times in a row last night, and just could not get enough. I've read that the song is about Maynard's mother who died 27 years after having a stroke. From what I could read into it, he's talking about being able to finally let her go. 27 years = 10,000 Days...Geddit? If ever there was a songthat was going to be as emotionally touching as this one, it would have to be about the artist's parent passing away or something equally as painful. Maynard achieved his goal in writing a touching tribute to his mother, and the band achieved theirs by creating their masterpiece. <br /> <br />The album could have ended for me after \\"10,000 Days (Wings PT2), but it keeps going strong with \\"The Pot\\". I've read the lyrics to this are a referance to the old saying \\"the pot calling the kettle black\\". This one reminds me of something that could have been taken off \\"Undertow\\". It's one of the more straightforward songs I've heard them do in awhile. It's not as proggy as they normally are, and I'm willing to bet it will be the next single released. After that is a short track called \\"Lipan Conjuring\\" which has Maynard chanting like a voodoo priest. It's actually pretty creepy! <br /> <br />\\"Rosettta Stoned\\" has got to be one of the strangest songs I've ever heard out of Tool. It doesn't need to grow on me because I already love it, it's just got a really trippy vibe to it. This one I can't really accurately describe right now, I need to hear it a few more times.  Trust me on this, it's quite odd, but definitely in a good way! <br /> <br />The last song on the album is \\"Right In Two\\". This one is right behind \\"10,000 Days (PT2)\\", and \\"Jambi\\" as my third favorite track on the album so far. The vocal melody, and the killer drumming make this yet another standout. It's about a subject I've always thought about. The fact that all human beings really are when you come down to it, is talking monkeys killing each other. It's about the arrogance of the human race, and I love them for talking about it because it's true. The album ends with \\"Viginti Tres\\" which is just some strange synth effects. Tool love to end their albums on a weird note, and this is no exception. Whenever I listen to the album I'll be done after \\"Right In Two\\", but that's fine. I am so thoroughly satisfied withthe previous 70+ minutes of brilliance, it doesn't really matter at that point! <br /> <br /> One other thing that definitely deserves mentioning is the absolutely fantastic packaging. The album comes in Digipak form with 3D glasses attached. Aside from being an excellent guitarist, Adam Jones is a fantastic artist and has come up with some seriously cool art to look at through the glasses. I'm not going to give anything away, but those of you who buy this album are gonna have a good time looking at this stuff. I know I did! <br /> <br /> I'm going to say this right now. No one else needs to even bother releasing another album this year. This album IS the album of the year as far as I'm concerned. Not only that, Tool has released their masterpiece. It took me awhile to fully decide that I liked \\"Lateralus\\" more than \\"Aenima\\". Not the case with \\"10,000 Days\\".  It's not too often I'd be able to honestly say I think an album I've bought the day before is one of my top five albums of all time. I can tell you that is the case with this record. This is a very special album that I can guarantee you I will be enjoying until I'm six feet in the grave. If any of you reading this should still be alive when that happens, I request \\"10,000 Days (PT2)\\" be played at my funeral.  <br /> <br />They've done it again folks.
B000001G5H|4.0|Hello, I am a music graduate in classical piano from a university in hamilton ontario... <br /> <br />I read an earlier review that complains about Maurizio's 'lack of expression' <br /> <br />If he knew anything about this artist then he would know that THIS WAS HIS INTENT...(he recorded the etudes a second time later in his career) <br /> <br />This recording of the chopin etudes was intentionally performed with a cool and calculating style.... <br /> <br />and yes it does not do justice to chopin's music, I don't think any performer should avoid the composer's original intent.... <br /> <br />but he is forgetting that a lot of the hype that goes into classical music, is based on the performer manipulating the composers music to make something new out of music that has been recorded a million times over... <br /> <br />and although I do agree with the reviewer's judgement of the ocean etude...(since I've played it myself and know the score inside out) I still think that maurizio's format works for him, it makes an impact on the listener <br /> <br />Etude no. 3 in E major sounds dreadful and rushed... but again, I've heard lots of pianists ignore the composers written indications on the score to bring something 'new' to the piece of music. <br /> <br />I believe that this is all he is trying to do, classical artists try to create a distinguishable style by recording old music in a new way, yet it is frowned upon... because it's not JAZZ music (where a composition is an outline and not made to the letter) so, the complete score allows people to look at a classical composition critically and make arguments against a performers interpretation. <br /> <br />classical music shows more proof in the score when someone is doing something erroneous....or something merely prodigal.. <br /> <br />Listen to Vladimir Ashkenazy's recordings of the Chopin Etudes if you would like a more sensitive interpretation, and (arguably) is closer to the composers intent/personality. <br /> <br />Just remember that if the music is old enough to exist before a composer could make his own recording of it.... <br /> <br />then 'authentic interpretation' will always be in a grey area.
B000053VJI|5.0|I'm also of Dominican descent and love love love Merengue.  But, some of the music out there is really perverted and not to be heard by young ears.  My daughters (ages 2 & 3) absolutely LOVE Juan Luis Guerra and I encourage them to listen to his music because I know that the songs he sings are sweet, romantic and respectful to women.  This album has my vote!
B000000W5N|5.0|The Stones, of course, have made many great albums and this one tops my list. Songs like \\"Brown Sugar\\" and \\"Wild Horses\\" are on the short list of best Stones songs ever. \\"Dead Flowers\\" is one of their best efforts at country. \\"Sway\\" and \\"Moonlight Mile\\" are very underrated cuts and Mick Taylor just is outstanding on \\"Can't You Hear Me Knocking?\\". Throw in \\"Bitch\\" \\"Sister Morphine\\" and the 2 bluesy songs and you have one great LP. This was in the middle of a hot streak for the band and probably the true peak of the band.
B00001OH7O|3.0|Coming on the heels of 'Man Who Sold..', this seemed lame and weak. TMWSTW (The Man Who..) was a Mick Ronson tour de'force guitar primer. Hunky was a complete 145 degree turn. Very little smoking lead guitar--bright production--catchy/pop songs-- <br />Sure, DB's just become a father at this time...Zowie/John <br />There are obviously some classic tunes here: <br /> <br />Changes--Ch-ch-ch...great tune--WAY too clean--needs to be 'dirtied' up <br /> <br />Queen Bitch-- the stand out rocker on the LP--A re-write of Sweet Jane (and who hasn't done that!) <br /> <br />Life On Mars--quite possibly DB's greatest song ever!! This song has been done by everyone from The Flaming Lips to Streisand--yes that one! it's on the \\"Fly\\" LP.  <br />Ronson's arrangements of the strings at the end of the song show his ability to work the song to the end <br /> <br />On this LP, Mick had a HUGE impact. He was allowed to arrange the songs. <br />It's a very personal LP for DB, Mick gets his say on production, DB becomes a father and things are looking up career wise. <br /> <br />Not one of my all-time faves, but a goodie none the less <br />
B000002MTR|3.0|Its not really fair for me to rate this Peppers album, since I havent heard it in ages, but from what I remember it was \\"average\\" The real reason I am writing is how in the world could the reviewer below me (Wesley A. Mcbryde)say that BSSM, arguably the most creative Peppers album to date, only manage to have the singles released on this be the strongest songs on the record, and the rest below par (not a quote from the reviewer, but summin it up in a few words. OK folks, you decide here are the singles of BSSM<br /><br />1.Under the Bridge 2.Breaking the Girl 3.Give it Away 4.Suck my Kiss OK what the hell about the other amazing songs on this album how bout Power of Equality, If you had to ask, BSSM, Sir Psycho Sexy, Naked in the Rain, and I could have Lied??? Those might be the strongest songs on the album, forget the singles. Sure those are good songs, but are you really a Peppers fan, or just an FM radio fanatic that just likes the songs on the radio. I find it very hard to believe why you think those songs are weak, but find One hot Minute a 5 star effort..EXPLAIN
B0002YLC24|4.0|One of the most charming films in many years, Before Sunset gives love a second chance with two enormously believable actors in their original roles. Reprising the roles of Jesse (Ethan Hawke) and Celine (Julie Delpy), the story takes up 9 years after they parted in Vienna after a one night stand, and the failed plans to meet again in 6 months, a semi-broken promise. But, for the couple, their paths cross again when author, Jesse winds up his publicity tour in Paris, and Celine, the environmental activist, attends his reading at Shakespeare and Co. <br /> <br />If Paris is for lovers, the city is the stage for the duo to cruise its afternoon haunts and river as they catch up with their lives that have gone in diverse successful but unfulfilled directions. Celine follows her career to help environmental causes, but her heart remains closed and unwilling to open to another failed relationship. Jesse married his college girlfriend and has a child, but his dreams of something more still bring the memory of his unresolved relationship with Celine to his sleeping hours. What if is always seductive and so the reunited couple discuss what seems least important and hurtful in an effort to avoid the regret that seems to envelop them at every sentence.  <br /> <br />The notion of a second chance with the one who got away is every middle age and older individual's daydream, yet so few adults get an opportunity to have their dream come back in their life.  <br /> <br />With an abandonment of youthful pretext, the mature Celine and Jesse admit how the other was the innocent and most intriguing moment for them. However, they failed to act with foresight beyond youthful exuberance. In hindsight, they are both wounded or unfulfilled having failed to achieve what they held as the most personal goals -- that of meeting again with the lost love. Richard Linklater creates an enjoyable and mature film of resolution and renewal as the story of Celine and Jesse begins and ends at the exactright moment to leave audiences satisfied.  <br /> <br />Using both the on screen chemistry of his actors and the perfect timing of their storyline to resume the characters next move, Before Sunset is perhaps one of those rare films that is a better film than the first installment. It picks up right where it should with characters who have grown as individuals and through life's adventures, might grow more as their story continues to unfold. <br /> <br />One need not view Before Sunrise to enjoy Before Sunset and the aging of its actors is both right and enjoyable. Hawke is not a boyish student, and Delpy is seductive with a French confidence that exudes sexiness. The film's locations, dialogue, and music by Delpy as well is just right for anyone who wants to step in the shoes of Jesse and Celine, and perhaps, take the next step along their crossed new path to happiness?  The perhaps is delightful!
B000ETQRCM|4.0|While it's inevitable that listeners of this new release will compare it with Pearl Jam's past work, in my opinion, this misses the point. Don't get me wrong: I am a true Pearl Jam fan, and have enjoyed their prior discs immensely.  But we are in a new era in 2006, and if you pay attention to the events in the world around us, you can't help but have a strong opinion about what's happening and how it effects mankind. Pearl Jam pays attention and their new disc conveys a lot of what they think these days. It's no longer 1991 and the band members are no longer in their 20's, just rocking out and acting like punks who dare us to take them seriously. So, in my opinion, it's unreasonable to expect songs that are very similar to what they've produced in the past.  Now they have something new to say, and in order to be fair, it should be evaluated by how well it relates to what's going on now, not in the past. The songs on this disc are a mixture of strong statements about war, struggle, and life's gains and losses. Some are better than others, but all are worth your time. The band has matured, the world has changed, and listeners should expect something new and different for their money. This disc delivers and is a worthy addition to your music collection.  I recommend it.
B000EULJLU|4.0|When these guys came out I didn't like them. I had friends that liked them, and I used to say, \\"well, I just don't get it.\\" I respected it, I just didn't get it. Maynard seemed pissed, but about what? I heard rumors he was a cross-dresser, he was molested as a kid, all this crap that fueled his so-called rage. It was on a \\"Rage\\" album that I first heard Maynard. Hell, I hated RATM when I first heard them, now I own every album of both Tool and RAGE and I love them both. I realized that TOOL used rumors and gossip amongst the people to garner interest in the band. They used to make stories up about the band members and you never knew who was who. At concerts, my friends would say: \\"Maynard was dressed as a chick and hid behind the drummer\\". Later I found out that Peter Gabriel used to pull the same crap with Genesis on stage. One of my friends even said at one of the concerts: \\"Nobody made a sound...we were waiting for Maynard like we were waiting for God\\". In the end, the band grows on you, and you hate them for a while for doing that too you. But then you pop them in and for one, I remember my youth through them and I thank them for it. It was good, careless \\"Friday\\" like times in the mid-ninetees when I was a teenager not giving a damn and getting a little something-something.  <br /> <br />This Album: I popped it in and already knew I'd love it and I did. I heard Lataralus and my first opinion was, \\"This isn't Aenima; and it's way too damn quiet. I think Maynard was having trouble transistioning from Perfect Circle to Tool\\". All I knew is that I wanted \\"fast, hard-edged\\" tool again. I love Perfect Circle too; actually I would call them a very \\"romantic\\" band--maybe you might go as far as saying you could have a candlelight dinner with your girl while listening to them...but that's me...and only the quiet tracks. BUT this album is fantastic: my favorite track being 5 \\"The Pot\\". My only complaint is that the sounds are not as diverse as on Aenima. You knew what songs were what--on this, the songs kind of sound the same as they bleed into one another. But these guys give their all on every album. As far as I'm concerned these guys knew what we wanted and they delivered. And the fancy domino album cover isn't too shabby either with wonderful art direction by Adam Jones. Can't wait to see the videos and Mr. Jones sick directing. Hear you in another five guys!
B000F0UV0E|5.0|I'm sitting in my living room listening to \\"All the Road Running\\" for the first time. This has just become a wonderful Sunday afternoon. Knopfler's guitar and Emmylou's voice are a perfect compliment. This is just plain beautiful music. I know a lot of the younger rockers aren't into nuance and melody so it doesn't surprise me that some rock critics wouldn't like it. I don't know what the Amazon reviewer means by center piece, the whole album is stunning. Doesn't break out of it's mid-tempo groove? Maybe it's not supposed to. Mark and Emmy are building a mood here. There is a definite dynamic to this album.It builds slowly and culminates with \\"Beyond My Wildest Dream\\" and lets you down easy with the last tracks. Doesn't take any chances? Well,thats just a reviewer's cliche. Amazon get yourself a reviewer who is open to the music.
B000002J1U|2.0|Sorry Led Zeppelin just does not do it for me.  And this third release by the band is certainly not comparable to their best material.  I give them credit for trying to explore their acoustic side.  However, too many of the songs have either unmemorable melodies or are just plain annoying.<br /><br />Out of the ten songs on this recording, I genuinely like three may be four of them.  Surprisingly my fave is the longest one Since I've Been Loving You.  The guitar riffs are very captivating and the organ touches are beautiful.  Robert Plant's vocalizing even sounds pretty good and I am usually not much for his shrieking.  Celebration Day and Bron Y Aur Stomp are also very distinguishable.  The later tune has a nice coffee house feel.  Immigrant Song is OK in spite of Plant's shrieks.<br /><br />The rest of the tracks are a bit toothless.  Four listens in and my memories of Tangerine and That's The Way are feint.  They have some nice acoustic touches but the melodies are weak.  Hats Off To Roy Harper is totally atonal.  Out of Tiles is just plain grating as is Gallows Pole although that one at least has a melody.  Friends at the moment falls into the forgettable tune category.<br /><br />Therefore two and half stars seems about right.  Decent effort weak execution.
B0000VCZK2|5.0|The Alien series never broke out the way that Star Trek and Star Wars did--you don't see the presence of an Alien-worshipping subculture, the way you do with Roddenberry's and Lucas's franchises. However, the series has been far more inventive and varied than those two franchises. Explore the Alien movies (minus the abomination known as Alien vs. Predator) on this 9-disc set. Even though they are very different films which have little commonality, aside from the presence of those vicious monsters and the lovely Sigourney Weaver, they complement each other well, and collectors would be wise to pick up this boxed set instead of buying the movies piecemeal. Far from being simple horror films, the Alien movies are attempts to put into film the anxieties of the modern age, from the biological to the corporate, and the series is at its best when it exploits these anxieties. <br /> <br />This is what the first entry in the series, Alien, does best. Directed by Ridley Scott, whose other work includes Blade Runner and Gladiator, this 1979 film pits a group of commercial astronauts against a foe which cannot be killed and will not be placated. With a cast that includes Weaver, Tom Skeritt, Yaphet Kotto, John Hurt, Harry Dean Stanton and Ian Holm, this is probably the most impressively-acted of the bunch, and Scott has style to spare. Unlike most terror films, this movie derives its thrills not from continual pop-ups at the screen, but from building a sustained mood of dread--the alien could pop up at any moment. When it does come, it doesn't stay around for long. Perhaps the movie's greatest attribute is its allegorical simplicity--one is bound to reflect on what the alien represents? Perhaps it's a Rorshach Ink Blot to some extent, however, this movie is the perfect counterpoint to such movies as Independence Day--instead of taking off and kicking ass, in Alien, nothing we can do can protect us from the Alien. In our post-Iraq, post-9/11 nation, perhaps this film will have gained some resonance in its treatment of the subject matter. <br /> <br />Aliens might be decried by some as a pure action film, but it is a bit more than that. James Cameron logically extends the concepts in the first film, and while it lacks the atmosphere and creepy suspense of the first movie, it is an extremely exciting and emotionally satisfying film. In this film, Ellen Ripley returns to the beast's planet with a squad of marines, which includes such personalities as the humane Cpl. Hicks (Michael Biehn), the freaked-out Pvt. Hudson (Bill Paxton) and the macho Pvt. Vasquez (Janette Goldstein). Also in the mix are Paul Reiser as the personification of corporate malfeasance, and Lance Henriksen as a sinister-seeming android. Trivia note: Henriksen would be the only actor (aside from Weaver) to appear in more than one Alien film. Ultimately, this is a movie where the thrills come from stuff popping out at you, but if you are willing to suspend disbelief a little and come along for the ride, it is actually quite good for a genre picture, and became the benchmark against which the later pictures were compared. <br /> <br />Alien3 is a film which never got a fair chance. Consider: a script which underwent more than a few major revisions, several changes in directors which actually produced the perfect man for the job (future Fight Club auteur David Fincher), a meddling studio and fan expectations which could not possibly have been sated. It was, in retrospect, a recipe for disaster, so one should not complain about how flawed it is, but rather realize just how good it is. Fincher manages to create a wholly convincing atmosphere of dread in a prison planet populated by monk-like inmates. It takes up the allegorical mantle again, but rather than the open-ended allegory of the first, this installment has overt religious parallels that anyone even remotely familiar with Western Civilization should be able to pick up on (even though some of the imagery is subtle). Thisset notably includes the Assembly Cut, billed euphamistically here as a \\"Special Edition\\", which is far closer to the movie Fincher intended to make. While there are any number of legitimate complaints against the film--the most sympathetic character dies halfway through, many of the inmates never really stick out, the final action sequence is too disorienting, high on gore but low on scares, etc.--it is actually a rather compelling film in its unedited form. Not perfect, but in terms of the plotting, main characters, and its insight into the mindset of the religious isolationist mindset, it is more than adequate. In terms of visuals and mood, no installment of the Alien series has been better. In my book, it's a good film with flaws rather than a flawed film with some good parts. The beginning and ending are contentious--watch the film and you will see why--but both serve the story, and the ending in Fincher's version is a surprisingly powerful one, as opposed to the theatrical version, which might have some Biblical undertones (the story of Jacob, specifically) but it feels more hollow. Overall, with this restored version, hopefully the movie will see an end to the backlash that has been pervasive since its release in 1992. <br /> <br />Alien Resurrection is the final film in this group, and while it is less polarizing than Alien3 among fans, it is also less memorable. If the original film was about a post-Vietnam set of anxieties, then this film is about a post-Berlin Wall set of ironies, and it cannot be displaced from the culture from whence it came--a culture which prided itself on being so \\"over\\" everything. Yet another director, this time Jean-Pierre Jeaunet of Amelie, brings a different twist to the franchise. Armed with a screenplay by TV wunderkind Joss Whedon, and game performances from Weaver, Winona Ryder, Ron Perlman, et al. The fundamental problem is that the viewer never really connects with the characters, and thus isn't invested in their fates. This being the case, the movie then becomes a series of action setpieces which don't quite add up to anything. The visual style is surprisingly lacking here as well: I once heard Amelie described as a David Fincher take on a Meg Ryan film, so I expected memorable visuals. I instead discovered that Roger Ebert was right when he said there was not a single shot to inspire the imagination. While the production values are high, the grotesque violence, fast-paced editing, camerawork and lighting all come together to make one feel as though in a video game, and while that might work for fourteen year-old boys, it's a far cry from the film's heritage. On the other hand, the satirical aspects of the film are enjoyable, and it somehow was much more beloved in Europe--maybe I'm missing something. Ultimately, the film is either a standard-issue thriller or a savvy satirical deconstruction of a standard-issue thriller--I'm not entirely certain. <br /> <br />The bonus features are interesting--commentaries on all the four films, featuring directors, cast members, and production staff. I guess that, given the amount of commentary tracks punctuated by uncomfortable silences, the folks over at Fox decided to cut to different conversations at different points during the films. There is a constant stream of information, some interesting and enlightening, other parts are funny (Bill Paxton's contributions especially), but the only one that is tough to sit through is Alien3's, which is unbalanced in favor of the technical side of the production and only has about 15 minutes of Henriksen and another actor. The documentaries go into great detail about all the films, essentially from the germination of the story all the way through to critical reception. Overall, it's a good collection of special features. <br /> <br />Overall, as far as franchises go, the Alien films are one of the better bets out there. As a receptacle for millenial anxieties, a proving ground for new and talented directors, and just plain scares, this is a series which should appeal to most and I highly recommend this set.
B000EULJLU|5.0|Before I talk about the album I just want to say if you are a Tool fan and you just burned the album instead of buying it then you are not a fan of Tool or rock music you are just killing an art that is fading away as I write this so just buy the album as well as other rock albums. Well since I said that I want to say that the album art is the best I have ever seen. The glasses and the 3D art is nothing less then breathtaking. Alone that is worth the price of the album, I mean the art work is just amazing. Now for the album, as lots of people I have been waiting a long time for a new Tool album. So when the time came for this cd to come out it just seemed unreal. Was the album worth the wait? I would have to say yes! This album is a masterpiece; there is a lot of meaning in the lyrics and the atmosphere it provides for the listeners is very understanding to ones soul. This album must me listened to a few times to understand this, you almost have to block everything around you and just listen to the music, that works best with headphones this way you can try and get disconnected from the world around you and let the music guide you. I know this sounds crazy but Tool fans can relate to this type of listening. I can not compare this album to the other ones because as we all know Tool's albums as much as they are the same from one another they are completely different. Each one is a new journey and you have to allow yourself to go there or you just won't get it, you have to allow the process to take over.
B00003CXCW|5.0|Loved and hated initially for it's biting view of the business of movies, this is a dark movie about people using people and Hollywood using everyone. Gloria Swanson's last words on how much she loves everyone, \\" . . . especially all the little people in the dark\\" really seems to be Billy Wilder's comment about us and Hollywood, that is to say, we're all in the dark.<br /><br />Well, perhaps with movies kept on the shelf for two and three years because the powers to be convinced themselves they would not make money . . . winning the oscar (Crash), we begin to see that art comes in second to money.<br /><br />Joe Gillis is a kept man and we slowly realize how he arranges it, goes along  with it and then eventually succumbs to it. William Holden is great in the role, and in the DVD 'extras' we learn that he wasn't the first choice for the kept man, Montgomery Clift was. Well, Holden proved his metal and was not found wanting. Probably Gloria Swanson stole the show although with time as an ally of 20/20 vision, she may have been playing herself.<br /><br />Definitely a keeper for any true movie buff. One of the great ones. 5 stars. Larry Scantlebury

0375507256|4.0|This is a pretty interesting book, both in story and in format. The first part of the book, Mitchell tells the first half of six stories spread out over a period of hundreds of years, starting with the year 1850 and ending at some undetermined future date. The second part of the book, Mitchell tells the second half of those stories, working backwards from the future to the past. Other reviewers have summarized the stories, so I will spare you. <br /> <br />The stories do all have a very loose connection, which you discover as you keep reading. They are all intriguing in their own right, especially since you're left hanging after reading the first half, until you get into the second part of the book. What is really interesting is how Mitchell is able to tell six completely different stories, in six different voices. It is like reading six different authors, all in one book. The book tries to be philosophical at times, wrapping up in nearly two pages of philosophical ponderings at the end of the book, which I didn't like. Just tell the story. <br /> <br />I have never ready anything by David Mitchell before, but I liked this book enough to want to read more of his work.

B0002WZTOI|5.0|This movie got a lot of criticism for being unrealistic, as if there are any \\"realistic\\" airplane movies. Or realistic Gladiator movies. Or slasher movies. Or courtroom scenes. Or boxxing movies.<br /><br />Top Gun gives you a slick nearly like 'Miami Vice' production, buffed dudes, excellent rock 'n roll, and great carrier scenes. What more could you ask for?<br /><br />1) OK. Weak plot. Hard to hang together. Pete Mitchell suffering the loss of his father over 'over a place where we shouldn't have been' Tom Skerritt later explains. Wow, that does clear up the confusion.<br /><br />2) Kelly McGillis. OK. A fine looking woman. PhD from MIT? Orbital physics? Seamed stockings? Wearing a leather jacket with the collar turned up in 105 degrees? Is this a centerfold for Maxim?<br /><br />3) Finally, because each pilot was not nearly psychotic enough, let's give him his own schizophrenic call sign . . . Hollywood? Ice Man? Maverick?<br /><br />Yet the movie does what it promises to do. Good looking young men flying hot planes, the music, and the best carrier scenes ever filmed. Good cast, Cruise and Kilmer of course, the aformentioned McGillis, Anthony Edwards, Skerritt, Michael Ironside. Pretty good actors. It did what it said it was going to do. I gave it a 5.

B000A0GP18|1.0|In \\"The Longest Yard,\\" the crummy remake of the 1974 film of the same title, Adam Sandler stars as the former N.F.L. quarterback Paul Crewe, who years earlier was booted out of the league for shaving points. In the original film, directed with seriocomic facility by the great Robert Aldrich, Crewe was played by Burt Reynolds with effortless charm, tufts of visible chest hair and the tightest pants this side of Tony Orlando. Finding a perfect groove as the fallen hero, Mr. Reynolds didn't attempt to ingratiate himself with the audience or make nice; he knew that we would fall for him anyway.  <br /> <br />Mr. Reynolds is also on hand for the remake, and here's hoping he snagged a nice fat paycheck for his trouble and ours. This time, the actor plays the role of a former college ballplayer, Nate Scarborough, who has been kicking around a dusty Texas prison yard for decades and wants to lend Mr. Sandler's character a helping coaching hand. As in the earlier movie, Crewe has landed in jail after violating parole and resisting arrest, among other infractions. He has also attracted the attention of Warden Hazen (James Cromwell), a cookie-cutter martinet who thinks he can use Crewe to improve his semi-pro team made up of guards and headed by Captain Knauer (William Fichtner, stuck playing a baddie once again).  <br /> <br />The new movie was written by Sheldon Turner, whose contribution to Tracy Keenan Wynn's original screenplay consists of the usual updating, including a lame bit about the television show \\"The View.\\" It's uncertain, however, whether Mr. Turner or the director Peter Segal deserves the blame for the opportunistic use of Malcolm X's image in one scene. This iconic image pops up in a scene that, like much of the movie, plays a lot like the original, albeit with some instructive differences. In the scene, a couple of white prison guards try to bait a black member of Crewe's team, here named Megget and nicely played by the rapper Nelly. Megget smartly refuses to take the bait. But because the filmmakers want to make sure we don't think he's a coward, they toss in Malcolm X.  <br /> <br />Leaving aside the idea that the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. might have made more sense in a scene hinged to passive resistance, this scene indicates just how little faith the filmmakers have in their audience and how much anxiety they have about what it means to be a man. Only with Malcolm X watching over him can Megget be forgiven for not talking back, for not getting his skull cracked, for not getting tossed off the team; only with Malcolm X serving as his symbolic guardian angel, it seems, can he be a real black man. One of the points that Aldrich makes in his movie is that the character is smart enough to bide his time. His courageous resistance inspires other black inmates to join forces with Crewe to fight what is, after all, a common enemy.  <br /> <br />Aldrich didn't haul out Malcolm X to pump up his football saga and curry favor with the audience, partly because the film's larger theme - the relentless pursuit of power - transcends racial lines. In the remake, Warden Hazen wants to use his football team as part of his strategy to assume the state governorship. The original Hazen (played by Eddie Albert, doing a 180-degree turn from his affable role on the sitcom \\"Green Acres\\") simply covets power, a rather more nihilistic take on what it means to live and to play ball. For Aldrich, football isn't just another Sunday night entertainment, it is emblematic of the human condition. The trappings of that entertainment - the cheerleaders, marching bands and cheering crowds - are secondary to the game's camaraderie, strategies and meaning. You play, therefore you are. <br /> <br />The first \\"Longest Yard\\" doesn't represent Aldrich and 1970's American moviemaking at their finest, but it certainly moves better and skews smarter than the remake. Softer, louder and cleaner than the 1974 version, the new film sentimentalizes the prisoners and the game, filing down their sharpest edges so that winning becomes a matter of triumph rather than resistance. In this respect, it is worth noting that the new film contains more speaking parts for black actors than the original. First among these unequals is Chris Rock, who as Crewe's right-hand man, Caretaker, has assumed the humiliating job of playing second banana to a less-gifted comedic talent. But like the hip-hop-heavy soundtrack, these speaking roles are mere calculation, a crude ploy to lure in black audiences and to make white audiences feel cool by proxy.  <br /> <br />Unlike Mr. Reynolds, Mr. Sandler has never been cool. Mr. Sandler's talent, such as it is, has been his ability to embody a strain of everyday guyness characterized by an undercurrent of aggression and a thick overlay of smug. At his best (notably, the drag-down fight with Bob Barker in \\"Happy Gilmore\\"), Mr. Sandler brings the American primitive male to instantly recognizable, abrasive life. The director Paul Thomas Anderson tapped into that primitivism in his film \\"Punch-Drunk Love,\\" but Mr. Sandler needs more off-center roles if he is going to transcend his rapidly aging frat-boy persona. Both last year's \\"Spanglish,\\" in which he played a family man, and \\"The Longest Yard\\" appear to be part of a strategy aimed at turning Mr. Sandler into an adult. But that can't happen with movies made by thumb-suckers for the delectation of other thumb-suckers.  <br />
B0006FO8RA|5.0|Britney Spears conjures up many reactions from different people: either they love her or they despise her more than any other artist out there.  Interestingly, whether you like her personality or not, her music stands ground for her more than she does as a person, and it's obvious to note: she's had some awesome hits in her career.  From her debut single \\"...Baby One More Time\\" to \\"Oops!...I Did It Again,\\" from \\"I'm a Slave 4 U\\" to the Grammy-winning \\"Toxic,\\" Britney Spears has recorded some great singles that are already considered classics in pop music.  Sure, she doesn't have the best singing voice by any means, but it's unique enough to make her stand out above most of her peers who seem to bleed into a pool of gray due to their mediocrity and similarity.  Thus her Greatest Hits is Spears' only record that is worthy of a 5/5-star review because it contains all her biggest singles; there isn't any filler here because each song represented on this record, for a few months on the charts at least, was a big hit for the time.  So you can loathe the woman like a splinter in your finger, but Britney Spears did rock the charts in the late 90s and early 2000s.
B00000JYGX|5.0|i am so in love with this musical.  it was the first french musical i'd ever seen.  my french teacher showed it to the whole class after we had translated every single song into english.  the hard work definitely paid off.  the musical was amazing.  i immediately fell in love and became obsessed.  i couldn't stop listening to the CD.  i love garou and bruno pelletier.  they're both very talented, along with everyone else in the musical.   <br /> <br />i really want to buy the two-disc CD, but i can't find it.  does anyone know where i can buy it?
B000EULJLU|3.0|Mediocre is about all I can say about the album, I am not saying anything bad about it and it is still better than 99% of the rock out there. However this is not typical tool and its not tool at their best, but it is a pretty good album. I gave it three stars rated against Tool, and what they can do and have done, if I were going to rate it against whats out there now, more like 4 to 4 and half stars. They are still a great band thats pretty freaking weird but this is not their best work.
B00011F5DK|5.0|This is a game that both kids and adults will love.  Our family is hooked on it!  I bought it for my 6 and 7 year old boys but my husband and I like playing it as much as they do.  It is great for a rainy day because you can keep playing it over and over for hours and won't get tired of it.  Plus, my 6 year old also likes to play with it by himself and use it to make patterns and pictures with the pieces when we aren't playing it the right way.
B000E6ESL2|4.0|When i first was watching this movie i was thinking what the heck is going on it just doesn't make sense, the movie buff in me told me to keep watching and that i would like it eventually, And I DID! The ending just about made this movie.  Give the Movie a chance and pay attention to everything, either you can be like some people and go to sleep half way into it, or finish it and enjoy the movie's fantasticly deep ending.  I loved the ending!

0307277674|5.0|I read this book before I heard all the hype about it and therefore didnt have a clue about what to expect. I must say that I found it to be a brilliant read. Yes the characters were a bit underdevolped even I a 14 year old could tell that but what the book lacks in character depth it makes up for with its fast paced plot.<br /><br />  I have read many of these reviews and I feel that I have to say this...the book is FICTION. Yes there are people who say that certaian aspects in the book are true (like that Jesus married Mary) but that doesnt mean that anyone is trying to make you believe such things. If you disagree with the book then don`t read it. I myself am a Christian and I was not offended in the least, I actualy found the ideas presented in the book very interesting.<br /><br />  There was a great story line which made it impossible for me to set the book down. I finished it in less than a day!<br /><br />  This is a must read for anyone with an open mind.
079284131X|4.0|The first of the five Child's Play/Chucky movies is also the best, a great and genuinely frightening tale that stands out as one of the best 'killer doll' movies ever. <br />    <br />   The movie gets off to a little bit of a shaky start.  Serial killer Charles 'Chucky' Lee Ray, being pursued by the police, is mortally wounded and ends up taking refuge in a department store.  Chucky, not only a serial killer but a student of arcane magic, uses his knowledge to transfer his soul into a doll in the store, planning to later enter a new human body.  Excellent idea, but if-ish execution.  Fortunately, that's the only area of the movie where the execution hits a hitch, because everything else is masterfully done.  The doll ends up being purchased for a little boy named Andy, excellently played by Alex Vincent.  It's Andy who ends up as Chucky's target to possess, as he's the first one to come to know the doll is alive.  Here's where \\"Child's Play\\" hits a lot of its potency: Andy is the only one, for a long time, who even has any suspicions about the doll, and it's having this innocent child know the truth but not the whole truth (he doesn't know Chucky is actually an evil killer in a doll's body), and being unable to convince anybody else, even as his own fears about his new friend start to manifest, to make anyone else believe him.  Some of the later Child's Play movies have run into real hitchs by trying to make the Chucky character into almost an 'unstoppable killing machine' type character, in the vein of Jason Voorhees or Freddy Krueger, whereas in reality he's only truly scary when people don't know what he is.  What works excellently with Jason and Freddy doesn't really work well with Chucky, because he's..well, he's a doll.  About twenty inches tall.  He'd be far Less dangerous than when he was human, except for when no one has a clue he's even alive.  Most of the sequels, while having their good points, have (in my opinion) tried too hard to position Chucky as a Freddy or Jason-level monster rather than going at it the way he was in here (interestingly though, \\"Bride Of Chucky\\" - the fourth chapter - made it work very, very well that way.  The others, not so much.  To me, anyway)  I actually think one possible route they could have gone with a sequel is to have had Chucky inhabit the body of an entirely different doll; maybe not even tell the audience which one it was.  Then at the end have it turn out he's actually in a mannequin body, or has possessed some other inanimate object instead of a doll.  Anyway, I'm getting badly off track here. <br /> <br />   The point is, Chucky is at by far his scariest in this first \\"Child's Play\\".  Another thing I enjoyed a lot is the cast of protagonists: Andy, his mother, and the cop who originally shot Charles Lee Ray play very well off each other.  There's also a 'good guy' magic practicioner, in a nice counterbalance to Chucky's having adapted originally benign magic for malevolent purposes.  The special effects are awesome, as they have been in even the weakest of the sequels. <br /> <br />  One last detraction has nothing to do with the movie itself, but how it's presented: it's apparantly only in Full Frame, which is unfortunate.  Not nearly enough of a minus to justify missing out on the movie though.  Enthusiastically recommended.
B000EYK4GW|3.0|I am not denying how great this Disney classic is.  And I will be buying it on June 6.  What I don't understand is the recent increase in price.  These DVDs have gone from averaging around $21.99 to $29.99!!!  That is a huge difference.  And I would bet that the day after it comes out, the price will drop, which seems to be the trend on Amazon lately.  So what is the incentive to pre-order these anymore?
B000BW7QWW|5.0|Joss Whedon is one of the most extremely talented people working in the entertainment industry today.  His work on the brilliant television series BUFFY THE VAMPIRE SLAYER showcased Whedon's versatility as both a writer and a director.  That show's spin-off, ANGEL, confirmed that Whedon was anything but a one-hit wonder.  His last series, FIREFLY, proved that he was capable of making most anything excellent.  Unfortunately, that show was cancelled after a mere two months, leading to a huge revolt by angry fans who blamed FOX for the cancellation - and rightly so.  FOX had no advertising campaign for the show, aired it on Fridays (a terrible night for television shows), and showed the episodes out of order.  Now those fans can rejoice: SERENITY, the feature film adaptation of FIREFLY, has arrived.    Five hundred years into the future, most planets of the known universe have been colonized and are run by the Alliance, a government which has a strict set of rules intended to make the universe a better, happier place.  Mal Reynolds (Nathan Fillion), a veteran of a harsh war against the Alliance, commandeers the spaceship \\"Serenity\\".  His crew consists of old war buddy Zoe (Gina Torres); her husband and the pilot of Serenity, Wash (Alan Tudyk); the ship's kind, lovable engineer Kaylee (Jewel Staite); and tough guy Jayne (Adam Baldwin). The job of Serenity's crew is smuggling, or more often thievery.  The crew gets more than they bargain for when they pick up rich doctor Simon Tam (Sean Maher) and his sister, River (Summer Glau).  You see, River is a psychic, and she's being hunted by the Alliance because of something she knows.  Having little luck finding River, the Alliance sends The Operative (Chiwetel Ejiofor), a top-notch assassin, to retrieve her.    Though it's not essential for one to watch FIREFLY before watching SERENITY, I highly recommend that you do.  For those who decide against it, though, Joss Whedon has done a terrific job of explaining the backstory from the show.  SERENITY opens with a brief explanation of the state of the universe in the future, which Whedon then seamlessly weaves into the storyline.  The sequence in which the characters are introduced is even more brilliant.  Mal Reynolds walks through Serenity, and as he passes each character they engage in conversations just lengthy enough to give us a sense of what each character is like.  In about five minutes, we know and understand each of these characters.  Of course, one gets to know the characters far better while watching FIREFLY.  The fact that the \\"companion\\" (prostitute) Inara (Morena Baccarin) and Shepherd Book (Ron Glass) are no longer part of Serenity's crew will mean nothing to those who have not seen the show, however it may shock those who have.    While FIREFLY was as much a western as it was a science fiction show, SERENITY belongs solely to the science fiction genre.  It's an old-fashioned sci-fi film, and yet it bears little resemblance to any of the genre's previous films.  You see, SERENITY, like all of Joss Whedon's other works, is entirely original.  There is not a cliche in this movie, nor - unlike STAR WARS - is there any clunky dialogue.  On the contrary, Whedon's script is laced with his trademark wit and originality.      Another Whedon trademark is realistic characters, and the characters in SERENITY are certainly realistic.  They're heroes, but certainly not in the traditional sense.  This is particularly evident during a confrontation between Mal and The Operative.  \\"I want to resolve this like civilized men,\\" says The Operative.  \\"I'm not threatening you.  I'm unarmed.\\"  Mal says, \\"Good,\\" and without a moment's hesitation draws his gun and shoots him.  Despite this, the crew of SERENITY are most definitely heroes.  They fight for what they believe in, no matter the cost.  They are also distinctly human.  In one scene, Mal and Jayne are arguing.  \\"Do you wanna run this ship?\\" Mal asks.  Jayne replies angrily, \\"Yes!\\"  Mal hestiates, unsure how to reply.  Finally he pipes up and says, \\"Well ... you can't!\\"    As far as filmmaking goes, SERENITY is a very impressive piece of work.  The lighting is as realistic as could be.  David Newman's score is good, and at times its excellent, though it's a far cry from Greg Edmonson's popular score from FIREFLY.  Each member of the cast delivers a great performance.  Particularly delightful is Summer Glau, who makes River seem extremely amusing and wildly unpredictable while also making her someone to pity.  Nathan Fillion is also terrific as Mal Reynolds.  His performance is occasionally reminescent of Harrison Ford's in the original STAR WARS.  Mal is very likable, dedicated, and sometimes clever, but he's human just like everyone else.  Chiwetel Ejiofor turns The Operative into an interesting character who never quite comes across as being dislikable; after all, he's just fighting for what he believes in.  Also of note is Adam Baldwin, who is hilarious as the brutish Jayne.  The only real downside of the film is the editing.  Although for the most part it's very good, the editing at the start of the film seems a little choppy and disjointed.    There is one moment in particular that I really loved.  The crew of Serenity has stopped at a bar to get the payoff for their last job.  River looks up a television and smiles.  Suddenly, everything turns blindlingly white and there's total silence.  The camera focuses on River as she whispers one word: \\"Miranda\\".  The camera then follows River's robe as it slides off her body and she walks away.  Then everything returns to normal and River begins kicking butt.    SERENITY is Joss Whedon's big-screen directorial debut, and what an impressive one it is.  It's clear that Whedon has a grip on all the attributes of filmmaking.  SERENITY is an original, intelligent, old-fashioned, and just plain fun sci-fi film that will knock FIREFLY fans' socks off.  Non-fans may enjoy it as well, but it's clear that this was designed for those many people who helped turn the complete series set of FIREFLY into one of the best-selling DVD sets of all time.
B0007TKNL0|1.0|Let me start by saying that this film degrades REAL opera singers.   I found myself laughing and cringing to no end when Carlotta gets dissed for singing Think of Me in an operatic  style -however exaggerated it is- yet when Chrissy sings the song everyone stops what they're doing and slip into a trance.  I mean even the phantom aka \\"musical genius\\" himself disses Carlotta's pipes over Christine's peanut vendor sound.  Oh but clearly choir girl's lowered octave rendition is far more superior to that of the opera's leading soprano. Puh-leaze!  I don't care if this flick wasn't meant to be an opera from the start, Christine is supposed to be an opera  goddess not some poor excuse for a soprano with a very limited range.  After all, she has been coached by the  so called angel of music since her childhood.  I take issue with the fact that most people who've seen this film actually  believe that Rossum's synthetic squealing is what's called opera.  Pre-pubescent girls mostly have this moronic  misconception.  \\"LAK ZOMG EMMY ROSSUM SINGS BETTER OPERA THAN SARAH BRIGHTMAN!!!!!@1111!\\"  \\"ZZOMGZ! SHES LAK TEH BEST SAPRANO EVA!!111    Opera singers are like the superheroes of music/voice (atleast in my humble opinion) and a voice like Rossum's being  coined \\"operatic\\" is shameful, distasteful, and degrading to people with such amazing talent. Stop calling her  an opera singer people, this chick is most definitely an alto.  I enjoyed listening to her lower register more   than when she was straining for those high notes which clearly she wasn't ready to sing.  Her acting? umm, I didn't  see any acting.  All I saw was the same deer-caught-in-the-headlights expression, wide eyes, gaping mouth, she looked  practically stoned, not mesmerized...but then again Butler's voice isn't the mesmerizing type.  Rossum has a decent voice, but it isn't Christine quality.    The Phantom.  One thing is certain, Butler CAN act.  He exudes passion, sensuality, and he's menacing.    I missed something though, why WAS he hiding down there in the first place?  it certainly couldn't be because  of his hot deformity.  Maybe it wasn't because of his third degree sunburn after all. Perhaps he was  just some reject wannabe composer/musician who didn't have the right chops to make it in the music industry. So,  he resorted to hiding beneath an opera house (of all freakin' places) and try to charm some dim-witted choir girl in hopes she'd fall for his \\"bad boy\\" side.  Yeah cause all us girls prefer the bad boy rugged type. Pfft. Spare me the bull [...] of ALW saying that the phantom had to be \\"a bit rough and dangerous\\" with a \\"rocky type quality to his voice\\".  This isn't Phantom of the Opera Superstar for crying out loud!  The Phantom is supposed to be a freak of nature.  Amazingly doted in the arts of architecture, magic, ventriloquism, and what's even more important, MUSIC and VOICE.  He is by no means supposed to be a freakin' Adonis.  He hides down there because of his FACE not his lack of musical talent.  Christine is enraptured by his genius, mystery -not his overwhelming scottish masculinity- but she also fears him. There was nothing to fear about this phantom, heck Christine is an idiot (something that most people who watch this film inevitably think, when they shouldn't) for dissing him over...      Raoul. Charming voice, but Fabio isn't the musical genius here. Neither is he the lonely choir girl coached by the so called musical genius.  Maybe the real Erik hides inside Raoul's closet, that sure would explain why Raoul has better vocal talent than phantom and Chrissy combined.  He's also very handsome but that's as far as it goes.  Wilson may be a broadway actor with a charming voice, but a film actor he is not.  Well he  definitely didn't show any acting skills in this flick.  He lacked any emotion/passion whatsoever, and the wig just made it worse. Unbearable even.    oh yeah, because I dissed all three actors I'm obviously jealous of Rossum's amazing operatic talent, Butler's rockstar abilities and sensuality, and Raoul's hair. AHA. HaHaHaHa.      What's the deal with Chrissie wearing a replica of one of Empress Sissi's hand-me-downs anyway?   Where are all the dazzling colors so dearly emphasized in the Masquerade song?  Why is madame giry the only one with a french accent, when everyone else seems to have gone british in 19th century France?  Why does everyone gasp when the phantom's hot deformity is revealed?    The movie doesn't suck completely though, the cinematography is quite splendid.  Minnie Driver is enjoyable in the role  of La Carlotta.  Butler is great eyecandy for the ladies.  Rossum is great eyecandy for the guys.  There are alot  of statues of naked gold women.  There is somewhat of an erotic atmosphere to the whole film actually. *gasp* but of course! this  is the same director who ordered nipples to be placed on the outside of Batman's costume...    \\"make it sexy Gerry!\\" *hurls*      It's very sad that the lead roles were cast more in accordance to their appearances in a film whose sole message  is 'beauty lies within' and contains the word O-P-E-R-A.  I don't get why the screen tests required them to sing at all when they were gonna get the parts anyway based on their marketable looks. Young, pretty, sopranos are a dime a dozen though, and all you needed was some 30 year old tenor for your phantom.  Oh but the flick has to appeal to the younger audiences, so we're just gonna cast some pretty chick who can sing the role of opera goddess Christine decently in a popera style.  We'll cast Gerard Butler as the phantom because he's incredibly beautiful, and we can synthesize his horrid shrilling.  Let's make it sexy and oh so marketable. After all, half of the audience aren't entirely familiar with the term opera, it'll be lak so easy! Complete. Bull.    I blame Joel for this disaster, ALW is simply weak like his henchman or something.  Nice work eegore!
B0001A79JO|5.0|This is one of my favorite CDs.. Every single one of the songs on the CD are different and unique, but not to the extent that it sounds like a mix CD. The band's style of music matches up so perfectly with their lyrics. <br /> <br />Basically, it makes me want to jump on a table and dance.
B000E6UWE4|5.0|Very very realistic setting and events that would make you hold your breath and cringe at the brutality and humanity of characters in 'Gardens of the Moon'. Tragic events that seem utterly senseless.  <br /> <br />Strip away fascade, strip away dignity and you're left with nothing. Just bones and ashes, blood. No other fantasy manages to achieve it in such scale, and the repeated theme of war's terror and humanity's base nature is only reinforced step by step through from book 1 to 6. Gardens of the Moon is only the beginning. Keep reading, you'll be left reeling.  <br /> <br />Book 1 consists of a vast number of characters and POV. Witty characters like the Bridgeburners that make you chuckle. Confused characters, trapped in their circumstances that make you pity and fear for them. Characters that simply in the wrong place at the wrong time. Erikon's not afraid to kill his characters, generating emotinoal impact and lying down paths for future plots.  <br /> <br />This is a series that is not for the faint of heart. It requires readers to put the two-and-two together. It will shock you and dismay you. Vast empires. Ambitious characters. Traumatic characters. Vivid scenes. Tragic and senseless deaths. Money talk. Truths that stare you at the face like reflections of our own society. Savour the series when you read them, for you'll be missing a lot if you fail to make the connections and pick up the hints. It's not a simple series with a clear ending. Don't people often say that fantasy starts with the ending known? oh no, not this one. It's so unpredictable that you cannot guess at (though you may try) what's to come next. The series, besides being entertaining and intellectually challenging, ultimate also asks some deep moral questions that you'd find very applicable to today's world.  <br /> <br />Very unlike all the fantasy books out there. You haven't read what true epic is if you haven't tried Erikson's Malazan series.  <br /> <br />Be prepared for a wild ride.
B0006IIKS0|4.0|As an \\"old school\\" Metallica fan, I followed the group back in the day when Ride the Lightning was new and the band was really coming out as an original force in hard rock music.  Like the band, I got older and got a job and mortgage and things changed.  While I have all of the Metallica albums, I felt that they progressively got weaker after the Black album and they were really about just putting together songs to sell rather than something internally driving them to make their own art as a form of expression.  <br /> <br />As for the documentary, it too clearly depicted the band during the turbulent time of the St. Anger CD production.  It really did give you a front row seat to the turbulence that was in the band with James going to rehab and the friction between Lars and James.  It also showed pretty clearly that the band had become older too, and showed a general apathy towards actually doing the music.  It was like \\"lets throw a bunch of stuff together and see what we can polish up to sell\\".  The documentary also presented how absolutely pathetic the band members were.  Not being able to communicate with each other and having to hire a Dr. Phil wannabe at $40,000 per month to counsel them.  Wow!  Even though the Dave Mustaine portion of him literally crying about how hard things were for him since he got kicked out of the band was absolutely hilarious.  He was an even bigger loser. <br /> <br />As for the band, I have to say that the documentary sealed it for me.  I have no doubt that they are musically bankrupt.  No longer relevant and don't have anything to say.  They may slap together a few more attempts to extract some cash, but they need to hang it up.  Their alternative is to be playing a state fair near you soon.  They need to go out with some dignity. <br /> <br />If you are like me, put on your headphones and slide in some S&M or MOP and remember the good music that did come from them. <br /> <br />
0060512806|5.0|Here's a gargantuan meisterwork for ambitious readers who can appreciate ambitious writers. Step aside if you have a short attention span or a lack of patience. Everything about this book is really really really big. In addition to the 918 pages in a rather small typeface, every scene, conversation, subplot, and theme is written by Stephenson to the point of absurd information overload. And that's the point, turning this into a manifesto of tech-obsessed sarcasm and paranoia, with prose that is ponderous but surprisingly fun to read. Nerdy language is used to great descriptive effect, especially in the way Stephenson describes settings and character developments &#8211; one example among many being \\"his net worth is a negative number that can only be expressed using scientific notation.\\" Stephenson's writing takes on the characteristics of the scatter-brained deep thoughts of his various math-nerd characters, and this makes for a bodaciously braindraining read.<br /><br />The narrative goes off on bizarre multi-page tangents like a mathematical theorem about when a character's bike chain will fall off, or a specific mechanical treatise on another character's method of eating Cap'n Crunch. You'll often wonder where Stephenson's going with this longwindedness and why you're struggling through so many hundreds of pages of woolgathering, but with patience you'll find that the prose and style of this novel add immeasurably to an astonishingly intricate and ambitious plotline. With this story, Stephenson has blown the roof off of cyberpunk and modern speculative fiction, seamlessly linking the ultramodern with the past into an incontrovertible whole.<br /><br />Most notably, Stephenson has defined retro-cyberpunk here, as he reconstructs nerdy codebreakers and analog cryptanalysts from WW2 into the original hackers and the geniuses behind the earliest digital computers. The war is transformed into a paranoid web of codes and spying that underlie the everyday horrors of slaughter and destruction, and Stephenson uses this device to analyze the true inhuman futility of war and its effects across generations. Meanwhile, his intricate conspiracy extends from the war to the present realm of super high-tech, with modern hacking and programming descending from the cryptanalysis of the war. After nearly a thousand pages the disparate storylines come together into a profound and wide-ranging conclusion about the human condition, while Stephenson has also ably explored the relationships between people, economics, history, and technology. This novel is not for everybody, but those in the proper frame of mind will find it to be an immense achievement for Stephenson, as is the reading of it.

B000EULJLU|5.0|Alot of people have given this album bad reviews because it wasn't another Aenima. If they remember correctly, Aenima had loads of filler songs with nothing but weird noises. This new album, \\"10,000 Days\\" combines aspects of Undertow, Aenima, Lateralus, and even A Perfect Circle. Maynard's time in APC helped him develop a more melodic sense of singing and he brings alot of melody to this album. Sure, there are like 3 songs that could be considered filler but they actually play out like little interludes with guitar and percussion (excluding the last one which is pure sound effects). I think this album beats Lateralus hands down; it's definitely a record that isn't meant for singles but the music is amazing. Standouts to me are: Wings For Marie Pt 1, (title track), Right In Two, Rosetta Stoned, The Pot.<br /><br />But they're all great though so dont let those disappointed reviewers steer you away.
B000002BBY|5.0|I got this cd after hearing a few of the beginning songs on this cd at camp. Of course \\"Wonderwall\\" and what i now know was \\"Don't Look Back In Anger\\" were the draw. \\"Wonderwall\\" is one of the best ballads i've ever heard and i recently learned how to play it on the guitar. Quality song, but the cd as a whole is amazing. I can't say enough good things - i love every song on the cd - they just all work well together. <br /> <br />Highlights: the whole cd, but specifically - Wonderwall, Don't Look Back In Anger, Some Might Say, Cast No Shadow (MOST UNDERRATED SONG ON THE CD...ahh, such a good song), She's Electric (funny song...great chorus) and Champagne Supernova.  <br /> <br />Try out this cd to get a good feel for Oasis....another good cd to look into would be \\"Definitely Maybe\\", their first cd - great song from there: \\"Live Forever\\". LONG LIVE OASIS. THIS = ONE OF THE BEST CDS OF THE '90'S. It's so damn catchy and well-written - there's nothing bad about this complilation. STRONGLY RECOMMENDED. =)
B000ETQRCM|5.0|It usually takes me a good five or six listens to really find if I like a PJ album. And I adore several of them and I love them all in some form more or less. <br /> <br />But this one? I loved on the first listen. And then I listened to it again, and once more and another time. <br /> <br />I won't say this is a \\"return to form\\" because Pearl Jam never lost their form. Certainly Binaural and Riot Act are not in my top five PJ albums but they both contain songs that are among the best in their catalog. <br /> <br />On this record there are no \\"skip\\" songs. It's straighforward rock and roll. Accessible and really good. <br /> <br />My favorite on the disc by far is Army Reserve. It surprises me how much I find myself loving this song. Ed's voice is really excellent, the production of the song is well done and the lyrics are subtle and clever. <br /> <br />There's a lot of straighforward rock here - Comatose, Severed Hand, World Wide Suicide, Life Wasted, Marker in the Sand - all with a unique approach and all are songs that will most definitely be great live. But my favorite of the bunch is Severed Hand - I love the sweeping beginnng. And that's another that that makes this particular record so appealing - there's a bit more production to the songs than usual, it adds more layers to the whole album as an experience and it definitely makes it a better record. <br /> <br />Parachutes is uncharacteristically whimsical sounding and a nice sort of palate cleanse at the halfway point.  <br /> <br />And like Army Reserve, another song that snuck up on me is Inside Job. It's beautiful and raw all at once. The beginning is seductive and it sucks you in and then changes into something else.  <br /> <br />And yes, it's political. I can't quite figure out why this comes as such a terrible shock to people that they need to complain about it every single album. Accept it. If you can't, move on. It's not like your endless whining about it is going to change the reality of what thisband is. <br /> <br /> <br />This is probably my favorite PJ album since No Code. I love that as they grow and learn as people, it translates and they still aren't afraid to try something else.
B000F0UV0E|5.0|Simply an awesome disc.  Mark Knopfler is my favorite guitarist and has been for many years.  His playing is like listenting to someone else use their voice, it's that expressive.  I'm new to Emmylou Harris and very impressed.  Just a great disc for any fan of good music.
B000EULJLU|4.0|Maybe I have been listening to a different album than most other reviewers, but I think that many of the reviews that have criticized \\"10,000 Days\\" as being far too soft, ambient, and even boring,  are strongly unfounded. I am not a rabid Tool fan, I have never heard \\"Opiate\\" or watched any of their DVD's, I don't hang on Maynard's every word trying to decipher his cryptic words, nor do I rack my brain pondering the outrageous time changes and vurtuosic musicianship found throughout Tool's catalogue. I wasn't even anticipating this album that much. What I DO know is, is that this is a fantastic album. For all of those who think Tool have gone soft, listen to \\"Jambi\\", \\"Vicarious\\", \\"The Pot\\", \\"Rosetta Stoned\\", or the end half of \\"10,000 Days (Wing Pt. 2)\\", and tell me it isn't some of the heaviest work Tool has created. \\"Heavy\\" doesn't necessarily mean crunching, loud power chords ads nauseum. Tool is one of the best bands in the world right now when it comes to building tension and having a song in a format of \\"Beginning/ Middle/ End\\" as opposed to \\"Verse/ Chorus/ Verse\\". \\"Jambi\\" is one of the best songs Tool has ever written, with crushing buzzsaw riffs and manic time shifts reminiscent of Metallica's \\"Master of Puppets\\". Another complaint about this album is that Maynard was holding back his vocals and low in the mix. Also not the case. \\"Jambi\\" features some of Maynard's best wailing in years. Although there are some slower, more atmospheric songs on \\"10,000 Days\\", (in my opinion they are pretty good anyway; \\"Intension\\" in particular) the album is not hampered by them as the bright spots are some of Tool's best material. The five strong \\"heavy\\" songs, (Jambi, 10,000 Days, Vicarious, Rosetta Stoned, and The Pot) clock in at about 45 minutes themselves. This is more than enough material to constitute a great album these days. There are two interludes in the middle of the album, \\"Lipan Conjuring\\" and \\"Lost Keys\\"; these are my only gripes with the album. The slower tracks such as \\"Wings For Marie\\" and \\"Intension\\" are relaxing and surreal, showcasing smooth guitar textures and brilliant tribal drumming from Danny Carey. The tribal drums throughout the album are a real treat and seem to have something to do with the album artwork. The packaging of this album is something of note, it really is a special package. Adam Jones and longtime Tool collaborator Alex Grey handle the case and art for \\"10,000 Days\\". The cover of the cd is flapped by a pair of stereoscopic lenses, which allow for intense viewing of Grey's beautiful artwork. Packaging can never make up for bad music, but it can certainly augment good music; in this case, the latter occurs. The packaging for \\"10,000 Days\\" is a sight to be seen. In short, this album is receiving a bad rap from hardcore Tool fans expecting the second coming of Christ. I believe this album to be light years ahead of \\"Undertow\\" and \\"Lateralus\\", although not quite as good as the almighty \\"Aenema\\". Highly recommended to fans of intelligent, heavy music.

B000BKVQTS|2.0|My friend and I saw this movie in theaters. I figured that being it was directed by Terry Gilliam it should be a really good movie. I was wrong. I personally feel the movie is too long and drug out. For only being about 2 hours long, I felt more like it was 3 and a half. Towards the end I was thinking to myself \\"Can we just get this over with already?\\" I was so bored with it all.
B000063WDH|3.0|Pragmatically getting the job done of equal parts rockin and bluesin, yet somehow managing to reinturpret some of the oldest sounds in the book and make it sound hip to indie ears is a hard feat indeed. Few bands play with such lack of pretense and irony that it is utterly refreshing in it's sincerety to here these guys do what they do. There is a definite repetition of sound that can bog the disc down, but that self-less raw-ness always seems to kill the monotony, especially on those few hard hitting songs with insanely delicious riffs in all their tonal simplicity. <br /> <br />
B00004YZFR|5.0|While I don't condone many of the actions taken by a bunch of drunken, unruly bikers who were paid in BEER for their services, I personally think that Meredith Hunter got he deserved for rushing the stage clearly brandishing a gun! Here's the kicker; I'm a Black Man! There was no blatant display of racism at Altamont and to call some ignorant kid's murder \\"racially motivated\\" is total rubbish, if he ran in my direction with a pistol and the only way I could defend myself was by stabbing and subduing him, then so be it. As for the Stones, they are shown here merely as what they are; entertainers, no more no less. This hardly qualifies as a snuff film as others have called it, but it does have an air of dread and darkness wafting over much of it and will keep coming back to haunt you long after the last frame. A great document of the violent end of an era.
B00000IMYA|5.0|There is so much wonderful writing on this release already, so I will make it quick.  On Ken Burns History of Jazz, George Wein talks about this marvelous concert.  He said that a very attractive blonde woman was dancing in an isle to Diminuendo in Blue/Crescendo in Blue.  Gonsalves was \\"playing to this woman\\" and it caused quite a stir in the audience.  Ellington then spurred Gonsalves to continue on and on.  A great historical anecdote that makes the recording even more special.  The fact that this performance is reputed to have rekindled Ellington's career makes it all seem more fun!
B000000OSG|4.0|Overall, this album has many of the best songs between the two _Use You Illusion_ releases, but it also contains some of the least good songs Guns 'n' Roses ever recorded.  First, for as great as the original version of \\"Don't Cry\\" is on the first disc, it was simply to fill space to include an alternate lyrics version on this one.  Plus, \\"Get In The Ring\\" was silly when it was new, although it does contain one of the funniest lines ever recorded by an 80's L.A. rock band; the line is directed towards the head (owner? executive editor?) of Spin Magazine, which is really all I can say here.  I can't forget, no matter how much I'd like to, the included version of \\"Knockin' On Heaven's Door\\".  After all, it really takes some bit of talent to take a song that was originally less than 3 minutes long and stretch it to 8 minutes long!  And it wasn't a last-minute decision either, as their 1987 MTV concert had them playing this same song four years before they put it on record; actually, it was four years later that the song finally ended and they were able to turn off the tape recorder.<br /><br />The rest of the album varies from decent to excellent, but hearing how bad the three songs I mentioned above are in comparison to the rest of the CD, it makes it all sounds almost as good as _Appetite For Destruction_...ALMOST...<br /><br />I among the millions of fans patiently awaiting the next Guns'n'Roses album, _Chinese Democracy_, and no matter how good it is, no matter how many times Axl Rose needs to tweak this or rerecord that, it will NEVER EVER be as good as _Appetite For Destruction_, but I will still buy it the day it's released.<br /><br />EVER!!
B000A59PMO|5.0|As much I have loved some TV shows recently--including such quality fare as Six Feet Under and Nip/Tuck--Veronica Mars is the first show that, upon viewing the season 1 finale, has given me the urge to run to my computer and type up an enthusiastic review (and to check when the season 2 DVDs are coming out, and to see if the show will be renewed for season 3).  Actually, this is my FIRST review for ANY product on Amazon, and simply put, this is one of the best shows I have seen on television--EVER.  You may have heard it all before: smart, sassy, sexy...and that's just Veronica.  Every character is constructed in detail with complex motivations and emotions; every situation is carefully plotted to fit into an overarching scheme.  The situations are engrossing.  In fact, most of my friends have been hooked after the pilot and 2nd episode alone...and not just casually so, but in an I-need-to-finish-the-season-marathon-DVD-viewing-session-urgently so.  One friend was hooked 3 minutes into an episode in the middle of the season without knowing anything that had happened previously.  Yes, the show really is THAT good.  And my friends have very diverse tastes, ranging from the aforementioned Six Feet Under and Nip/Tuck, to The O.C., Alias, and Chappelle's Show.  If you've never heard of Veronica Mars, rent the first DVD and try it out.  If you've heard anything about this show at all and are just a bit curious, go ahead and take the plunge--buy the series, you won't be sorry. <br />Here's hoping Veronica makes the 2006 Fall lineup on the new CW network--they've got a potentially huge hit show on their hands, they just need a bigger network than UPN to support it and help it find the audience it deserves.
B000002H33|5.0|This album, around the time of its 1986 release, completely changed my perception of what music could be, and overnight I had abandoned my Bon Jovi, Stryper, Ratt, and Cinderella tapes in favor of this new breed of actually HEAVY metal.  I still rank this album among my top five of all time favorites, not only for the memories it holds for me, but for the dexterity and precision the music is played.  Not one single note is misplaced, even during the last verse of \\"Disposeable Heroes\\" for those who have heard the album half as many time as I have.  The twenty years since its release have somewhat prepared the general public for the intensity of the music here, since many of the songs can be heard during the daylight hours on many rock stations, and Metallica itself is a household name.  Let me put it this way: when _Master Of Puppets_ was released, MTV was huge and making Motley Crue and Bon Jovi even bigger, but Metallica refused to budge and never made a video for any of the songs on this album; the record still went platinum that year, WITHOUT the help of MTV, without the help of massive radio airplay, and without having to compromise their sound.  Things have changed since 1986, both with Metallica and MTV, but I'm not going to discuss that here...just buy this CD already!
B000ENWKN8|5.0|Everysooften an established artist records an album that non fans actually enjoy and embrace while long-time fans react with surprised (and usually unplesant) indifference. KISS did this with \\"The Elder\\" (1981), the Greatful Dead with \\"Terrepin Station\\" (77), Bad Religion with \\"Into the Unknown\\" (83), Sabbath with \\"Seventh Star\\" (86) and the Stones with the definnitive example \\"satanic Majesties\\" (67).     I'm not much of a Rob Zombie fan but I bought this CD because of John 5's involvement. I'm listening to \\"Horses\\" a lot- I find this to be his most accessible and entertaining work. It comes accross as a more down-to-earth version of Marilyn Manson's \\"holy Wood\\" and \\"Golden Age of Grotesque\\" with elements of classic Alice Cooper. However, bassed on several reviews posted by his \\"established\\" fans, most people I learn were disappointed by \\"Horses\\". This is why I'm placing this CD in the \\"album-for-non-fans\\" catagory.
B000003TA4|4.0|Most people reading this already owns this CD anyways, but I'm going to say my bit anyways.  This album is notorious for what it did to the music industry within months of its release: it not only helped kill off the stagnant and already-dying 80's metal scene, but it pushed everything prepackaged and inherently processed aside (it started Michael Jackson's sales decline), and for that I absolutely love this album.  Plus, if not for Nirvana, I probably wouldn't have discovered Soundgarden or Alice In Chains until much later, and considering my personal life in 1992, I dread to think of what other musical choices I had to listen to back then.<br /><br />As far as the songs on this CD, if it only had \\"Smells Like Teen Spirit\\" recorded twelve times, it would still be a great album.  Luckily, there are a few more, and they're all quite good.  As far as Nirvana's best album, that title would go to _In Utero_, but by then they were already established and people bought _In Utero_ out of habit.  _Bleach_ is another one that everyone should own, since the songs are much more raw and loose than on _Nevermind_, but the drumming kinda sucks, since Dave Grohl wasn't part of the band yet.<br /><br />I stopped listening to Nirvana abruptly after Cobain chose to leave the industry, but after a few years of listening to all the newer bands imitate the style, it was very refreshing to go back and listen to _Nevermind_ as if it were my first time.  And for killing off hair metal, I will forever love this album...
B00004RYZT|5.0|This requires a bit of a German lesson to fully understand. <br /> <br />The verb 'haben' mean 'to have' in German and the verb 'hassen' means 'to hate.' <br />Germans conjugate their verbs by changing the endings. <br /> <br />We do this in English as well. Take the verb be: I am, he is, we are. Or have: I have, he has, we have. <br /> <br />The way you conjugate haben for you have would be du hast. <br />For you hate it would be du hasst. <br /> <br />Since du hasst and du hast sound the same, and even though the lyrics say du hast, up until Till says \\"du hast mich gefragt\\" (you have asked me) it could be either one. This gives the song a double meaning.
B000000OSE|4.0|Fifteen years after its release, and many of the songs still hold up.  In fact, it would be easier to pick out the ones that have aged: \\"November Rain\\" was overbloated and tiresome by the five-minute mark the first time I heard it, and \\"Live And Let Die\\" was way too slick and overproduced to be an effective cover.  Otherwise, this album holds its own, although you'd be hard-pressed to find anyone who owns this and not _Use Your Illusion 2_ as well; they were both released on the same day, and they entered the album charts at #1 and #2, respectively.
B0002858YS|4.0|The great thing about Hot Fuss ist that these songs don't take 10 listens to really get into them, 1 listen and you remember them. It combines electronic, with 80s, with new age rock. Some people compare this band to Franz Ferdinand or Modest Mouse, but The Killers seem to have a sound all their own. It doesn't really matter that they are one of the group of bands doing their best to resurrect that new wave/punk sound. I really hope they keep it up and make a great follow up. I originally purchased Hot Fuss after hearing \\"Somebody Told Me\\". The CD ended up surpassing my original hopes.  They may not be the best lyricists in the world, but they definitely know how to create a good hook and melody. A great sounding cd as well! For any IPOD owner definitely a must to add to your play-list. <br /> <br />
B00006DEFA|5.0|This movie is, to quote Jack Mathews' USA Today write-up, \\"about as close to perfection as movies get.\\"  I say that about the original theatre release.  While I enjoyed the special features and the digitally restored and remastered picture and sound of the Director's Cut, I think that there were good reasons why Milos Forman and crew deleted the \\"20 minutes of never-before-seen footage.\\"  The pacing drags, but even more distressing, we see Herr Mozart reduced to giving \\"canine concerts\\" and submitting to other forms of degradation.  In the original release, Mozart rarely raises his voice against Constanze; in this version, he's quite irritable.  The Director's Cut does explain why Constanze later in the movie openly dislikes and distrusts Salieri.  In the original release, I had accounted for her otherwise inexplicable change in attitute as woman's instinct. The Director's Cut does allow for greater character development of Salieri.  For example, he struggles more with his belief system before turning his back on it. Salieri's jealousy prompts him to go out of his way to sabotage Mozart financially, spreading slander so Mozart will be unable to attract pupils.  And we see that Salieri has quite the sweet tooth as he's munching on some delicacy in most scenes. (Elizabeth Berridge comments that she almost got sick when she had to eat \\"the nipples of Venus\\" (marzipan) during several takes of the scene where she solicits Salieri's help to secure Mozart an important teaching position.)<br /><br />The reason I'm still giving the Director's Cut 5 stars is because I love this movie and am glad that we fans have an alternate (though less \\"perfect\\") version of this cinematic masterpiece.  The cast interviews (20 or so years after making the movie) were  a pleasure to watch, and we're given lots of inside information. For example, Tom Hulce and F. Murray Abraham contrived an off-screen animosity to keep up the spirit of their characters during filming. Elizabeth Berridge laughs about the reason why she was chosen over the other final contender for Constanze:  she was \\"less attractive,\\" and therefore, more believable as the \\"street kid\\" the movie depicts Stanze to be. (Historically, Constanze was quite the mezzo soprano; this film makes no reference to Stanze's singing nor to the fact that Mozart more than once composed with his wife in mind.)<br /><br />During the crew interviews, Milos Forman remarks that Mozart's music became the third main character, an entity onto itself. Milos and Peter Shaffer speak about being humbled by this third character and how they were both overwhelmed by the music's beauty.<br /><br />Even if this movie betrays several glitches in historical accuracy, it is both moving and entertaining. I first saw this movie when I was about 11 and at the time, had rarely (if ever) heard Mozart's music (now I'm a full-blown fan).  This movie exposed a generation to this great music and the man-behind-the-music (given the concession that Peter Shaffer distorted the maestro's personality for dramatic purposes).  I remember the MTV video \\"Amadeus, Amadeus,\\" and think it's cool that pop culture paid tribute to Wolfgang with a catchy tune (how apropros :-).

B000CBSHK2|4.0|Beth Orton is a talented and unique singer-songwriter with a consistent sense of releasing good music. The soul of Beth Orton songs have always been  two things - her great voice and her fantastic lyrics. \\"Safe In Your Arms\\" was my first favorite off this album. Next, \\"Heart of Soul\\"  a more upbeat piece to break up the slower songs. If you're a fan of Beth's or new to her, this CD is for you. Excellent music from beginning to end. It's different in style to Trailer Park and Central Reservation, but all in all a great album.
B000EJ9MTW|5.0|I bought the classic Sabbath albums when they were first released, I bought the classic Deep Purple albums when they were first released, too, and I bought this last week. Sure, it's retro, sure, it harks back to 1970, but it was recorded by young musicians in the last few months, it was released just a few days ago and it does contain all the influences mentioned by other reviewers... and then some. It reminds me of a heavier version of Marc Bolan and T.Rex, but with better vocals. In the context of today's guitar bands the album is actually a logical step forward in reinventing the past to create the future. It works, it's infectious, it rocks and it makes me wish I was twenty years younger. Definitely a five star album and I hope the band are as good live.

B000ETQRCM|5.0|Pearl Jam's newest album rocks!!  My favorite remains Vs., but this album has that upbeat feel to it.  The first single \\"World Wide Suicide\\" reminds me of \\" Do the Evolution\\".  Eddie Vedder's lyrics come alive and you can feel the passion behind all of these songs.  Personally, \\"Comatose\\" has been played the most on my player.  Buy it, you won't be sorry!!!
B00005JO5L|4.0|I've always enjoyed \\"Cruising\\", Billy Friedkin's opus on violence, male homosexuality, leather and all things bizarre. Right from that great line, \\"Have you ever been porked?\\" between stars Paul Sorvino and a fresh-faced Al Pacino, this film draws me in like few others.<br /><br />While the police action and the chase mystery are interesting, what I enjoy most about this film is Pacino's transformation from all-American boy cop to undercover cop to feigning homosexuality in the leather underground of New York and the changes he goes through to get there. The script suggests he and girlfriend Karen Allen lose their love life in the process; how could they not? Try chaning your sexual orientation sometime for the focus of your job.<br /><br />The scene between investigative chieftain Sorvino and his boss, who makes it clear to Paul that he either catches the killer by the time of the upcoming 1980 political convention or \\"I'll put someone in your seat who can do just that\\" adds an element or reality to the film, which straddles the line between fantasy and reality much of the time.<br /><br />After being given the ultimatum, Sorvino turns up the heat on his undercover cop turning gay man, Pacino. In a touching and dramatic scene, Sorvino not only turns down Pacino's request to be released from the case, he hands him potential new leads and in effect says, \\"Catch this guy.\\"<br /><br />So, for me, this film is full of human realities and conflicts that make it a great film. This transcends the somewhat mundane material -- the norish police drama focused on catching a serial killer in the gay leather underground -- that makes it a compelling film about people and situations and how the two come together in art.<br /><br />One thing I've never understood -- the ending. All seems well afterward, but is it? Does the tug in the harbor signal some rumbling beneath the surface? Or does this signal a return to normalcy for everyone. This is the kind of emotion Friedkin generated in all his films. Since no sequel was produced, I may go to my grave wondering about this. If so, I'll be pleased to watch this film another half-dozen or dozen times trying to piece this together.n generated in all his films.

Every claim that Harris makes is backed up with evidence and his bibliography provides an amazing list of further reading on most topics he discusses. <br /> <br />Islam takes a good deal of the authors criticism, but Christianity, Judiasm, and even dogmatic secular beliefs systems are not spared either. If you want a well-written book that chronicals the imminent danger and daily deaths caused by religious beliefs, this one is for you.

B000002GVZ|5.0|This CD, \\"The Best of Carly Simon\\" is one of the finest albums ever released by none other than the famous Carly Simon. All ten of these songs are true classics and her most well known titles ever to come out. This came out in 1975 (still kind of early in her career), and was her sixth album released by Elektra Records. Since this title came out in '75, it does not contain \\"Nobody Does it Better\\" or any of her later hits (which appear on later compilation titles). This would also be a \\"mixed bag\\" album, containing songs of different sounds. The first track, \\"That's the Way I've Always Heard it Should Be\\" is a nice and quiet song with a soft start and gets a little loud three times. Next comes \\"The Right Thing to Do\\", with a nice mellow sound. The third song title, \\"Mockingbird\\" is a great one, as well, with James Taylor sharing the microphone with Carly. The fourth track, \\"Legend in Your Own Time\\", is soft and mellow, with the guitar, Carly's vocals, and some bongo drums combined together for a nice quiet sound. The fifth track, \\"Haven't Got Time For the Pain\\" is great as well with Carly's voice coming in with the piano. This is a nice mellow song with a soft rock sound to it. Then, the sixth song, \\"You're So Vain\\", which I assume is one of Carly's best known songs and a signature tune for her, has a nice \\"middle-of-the-road\\" sound. This one starts out with a soft guitar sound and she whispers \\"son of a gun\\" and starts singing the lyric within the next few seconds. I have noticed that Mick Jagger is one of the (special guest) background vocalists on this one song. I have also learned that there is a mystery about who the song is about. Some people think it is Mick Jagger, others think it is Warren Beatty, or it may be about another prominent celebrity. But, whoever Carly sang about in this song, only she knows. If she doesn't want to reveal who the song is about, then that's her business as well as her decision. Sometimes something is better off being a mystery. Back to the song listing, the seventh track, \\"(We Have) No Secrets\\", is another nice mellow track. The eighth track, \\"Night Owl\\" is another nice sounding one, with almost a hard rock like sound to it. The sax solo in this song is wonderful and blends in well to the rest of the instrumentation. Paul and Linda McCartney made a \\"special guest\\" appearance, providing some of the background vocals on this title. The ninth song, \\"Anticipation\\", is smooth and mellow, and is another one of Carly's signature songs. Last comes the tenth and final track to close the album, \\"Attitude Dancing\\". This also is a great one, and has almost a disco like sound to it. I have this album on all three formats: LP, CD, and tape and I would think of this album of hers as one of my favorites. This is the first album of hers that I listened to. The CD that I have of this album is not a remastered one. I think the sound quality is excellent and clear, even though the back insert says that \\"there may be some limitations from the source tape\\". I didn't detect any limitations in the audio on the CD, but it's nice of the manufacturers to point it out to consumers before buying, just so that they know what they might get. But, even though CDs are the best format of music to buy,  there is so much that CD manufacturers can do to make the audio quality as sharp and clear as possible. If such a music title on CD has some slight audio flaws from the original master tape, they do not and should not interfere with the playability of the music (some flaws may not even be noticed in the music). Carly Simon is also one of my favorite singers ever with such a wonderful voice. This album contains her most well known songs and not a single one is a \\"filler\\". Great title to start out with if you're just discovering Carly's work. No Carly Simon music library would be complete without this album!! Get it and enjoy THE BEST OF CARLY SIMON.

0920668372|1.0|This was read during storytime at our library when my daughter was 5. While I thought the story of the mother obsessed with her child was funny (as did my daughter), when it came to the end and the allusion of the mother dying, quite a few of the children were upset. Including my daughter. She was anxiety ridden for a while after hearing this and no amount of talking, consoling or explaining on my part helped.  <br /> <br />While it is a silly, fun and sweet story of how a mother loves her child no matter what, I don't think this is a good book for young children. I agree with the suggestion of going with \\"Guess How Much I Love You\\"
B000EULJLU|5.0|This album doesn't sound like Aenima or Lateralus, that's why so many people are dissappointed. All I have to say is that if you want to listen to something that sounds like those albums, then put them in your CD player and listen to it. 10,000 days is another unique experience from a great band. At first, I thought the album was an OK effort from Tool, but after listening to it (start to finish) about 20 times or so it has grown on me and I feel it is just as good as any of their previous albums (I have listened to Tool since undertow). <br /> <br />The true songs on the album are Vicarious, Jambi, Wings (Wings for Marie and 10,000 days), The Pot, Rosetta Stoned, and Right in Two. Everything else is a standard Tool filler track. Vicarious and Jambi start off the album and sound like something you would expect from tool. The Pot is an amazing vocal performance by Maynard, and shows that he still has it in his old age, the beginning will surprise you. He makes his voice sound high like it did on undertow, but much improved. Rosetta Stoned is one of two \\"epic\\" tracks on the album, talking about a guy who had an alien encounter and is now in a hospital bed telling his story. Very unique lyrics, but a very interesting song, excellent instrumentals. Right in Two, one of my favorite tool songs ever, has maybe some of the best lyrics of any of their songs. It starts off slow, some would say APCish, but it builds up to this extremely climatic part reminding me of Lateralus a bit. The wings epic has grown on me alot and is my favorite on the album, especially the second part, starting off very slow and dark and building up to an amazing finish, beautiful lyrics revealing that the album's name refers to MJKs mother who was paralyzed for appx. 10,000 days. <br /> <br />If you are a tool fan you will like this, the instrumentals are great, Maynard's vocals are amazing, and they lyrics are as good as they get. Warning though, you will need to listen to this album a few times before you can get into it. When Aenima came out, I had to listen to it many times to get into it, and the same way with Lateralus, and now 10,000 days. Each album has provided its own unique experience and that is what Tool is all about.

B000EQ5TSI|1.0|Many people criticized this movie for having no plot. Which is a result of many people criticizing the first for being too complex. There's just no pleasing some people but this movie could have made up for it by having some class or a formidable villain. Dougray Scott is pretty much one of the worst villains ever and a poor representation of Scottish actors.<br /><br />John Woo uses some wonderful Australian scenery but fails to inject any sense of excitement to the fight scenes. The gun battles look too damn staged and the fist fights are all done in slow-motion, which robs them of any realism or hardcore. Seeing as how this is a PG-13 the action is also pretty damn tame. Which is a shame since Woo is a pro at this. You hardly see any bullets even enter bad guys never mind exit. It's all done off screen. If people wanted tame violence why on earth did they hire Woo to direct? It's a bit puzzling.<br /><br />Although it IS tame it is still darker and harder than the original. But the duff biochemical warfare plot is pure video game crap. I can't believe Robert Towne had a hand in writing this. It's like a rejected plot to a Solid Snake PS1 game. There's seems to be some focus on making it a James Bond/Die Hard wannabe instead of respecting the source material and offering us any iconic or memorable set-pieces.<br /><br />Another major thing that is wrong with this movie however is Zimmer's score. For a movie that is 124 minutes long we get about 30 minutes of music. Zimmer is known for his talent of creating ambient and versatile music. But NONE of that is present in MI-2. This was movie was made around the time of his decline into mass-produced soulless stuff. Which is also a shame.<br /><br />It's the wrong plot, the wrong director and the wrong approach that turns this into a movie for idiots. They really under-estimated the audience and fumbled the ball with this one.<br /><br />John Woo's original cut was 3.5 hours long. None of that footage is on this new 'Special Edition' DVD. What a waste!
B00004S6GL|5.0|This is Elliott Smith's greatest album in terms of composition, arrangement, and lyrics. <br /> <br />The sound is superb, and you truly get a feeling for how great of a songwriter he is;  he will go down as one of the classics along with Elvis Costello, Bob Dylan, etc... <br /> <br />I really have to dissagree with his \\"old fans\\" who think this album is selling out because he's using nice recording equipment and more than an acoustic guitar.  These people need to remember that one of Elliott Smith's primary influences were the Beatles and they had the most elaborate, orchestrated sound on most of their albums;  why wouldn't he take inspiration from one of the greatest rock groups and/or one of his greatest influences? <br /> <br />C'mon now...

B000002G7E|5.0|If the 1st Velvets offering served as an Old Testament blueprint that firmly placed them within commercial respectability as far as gaining an audience with Andy Warhol in control by shaping the sound of artistic misanthropic, doper East Coast rock (or whatever label comes to mind)this their 2nd set was so distinct from the hippie rock coming out of the West Coast at the time, and remains their album of defining greatness, their gift of enduring value..rock and roll feedback,New York decadence,Pure Rock Mania, all the bittersweet emotions of life lived on the razors edge with all the ruminations of youth,alienation,sexuality and artistic madness all rolled into a total cacophony of sound that rocks out with beauty all it's own.<br />Nothing comes close to capturing the surging feel of the opener White Light/Heat as a total rock and roll speed rush, the novella set to music,The Gift, is a long neurotic conversation with this gorgeous music coming out of one speaker with John Cale's story about obsessional love coming out of the other..I Heard Her Call My Name is pure distortion with melody..The bittersweet Lady Godiva's Operation is perverse melody..The benchmark, Sister Ray is a total blowout of 18 minutes while the quietest track Here She Comes Now smacks of lush decadent beauty..<br />Highly Listenable..belongs in every collection.

B000EULJLU|1.0|First off I'm a huge fan of all their other albums but this one just sounds like no effort was put into it.  I'd say a good 75% of the album is just weird droney ambient noise or repetative generic Toolish riffs.  The whole album to me is a big F*** you to their fans.  I was so excited when I heard this was coming out and eargerly waited just to be disappointed by this pile.  After a 5 year break you'd think they'd have some good ideas or a desire to create something amazing like their other albums.  This just sounds like a sub par band doing a Tool impression.  Lame guys lame. <br /> <br />TOOL is dead to me, I hope Maynard chokes on the millions of dollars they make off this miserable excuse of an album. <br /> <br />I only gave it 1 star because you can't give it negative stars.  If you must buy this, get it used off ebay so they don't get any more money off this turd.
B000002G7G|5.0|Most consider this release the Velvets most accessible, like-able set of songs reeking of simplistic beauty and the one to savor for eternity..You can't disagree with that assessment since this album is listenable all the time capturing the many moods that comprise a day in the life of anyone I know.<br /><br />10 songs, all clear as a bell, something so unlike their first 2 releases...the exit of John Cale, Andy Warhol, now a more mature Velvets, introspective but remaining Primal clearly in control and capable of georgeous balladry.<br /><br />There are 2 mixes out there...this one here and the closet(murkier) mix found on the box set \\"peel slowly and see'..<br /><br />both are essential.
B00005J6T1|5.0|What can you say, I had this on vinyl and it sounded new and fresh in 1983,1984. Listening to this newly remastered cd it sounds as fresh and new as it did in 1983 and 1984.catchy and pop disco filled fusion ballads along with some rock mixed in, this first Madonna album really has alot of depth to it. Starting with lucky star this recording got your attention and let you know this listening experience would be an awesome one. Holiday was the foundation song on this recording. I remember watching Dick Clark on american bandstand in March 1984 and seeing Madonna perform holiday, this moment would launch her career to super stardom. All eight songs on this cd are all a true testament to being  great music because people are still buying this cd today. The two extra mixes are cool to. The thing I like about this recording was it was'nt as commercial as Madonnas later albums. You took Madonna for what she was, not a material girl. This album along with madonna had an innocence to them. Listening to this cd brings me back to a much simpler time in my life. Yeah and like with \\"Like A Virgin\\" this record did skip on me due to scratches, thank heavens for technology!!!!
B0000033WC|5.0|Lou Reed did it..the survivor, new bandmates and studio musicians,a new age...total greatness, a 2 CD gift for the fans..the original album,the alternate album,early versions,full length versions, demos, early skeleton songs that appeared later on Lou's solo works with the demise of the Velvets, all in all not a note to be missed.. all loaded with a wonderful booklet, cover art appreciated by any NYC Subway junkie.<br /><br />On this 4th offering, the band(now officially broken up) set out to show that they remained that tight Long Island Rock band of Lou(minus the drummer Mo and John Cale's replacement, Doug Yule singing lead on 3 great Reed compositions) showering a slew of tight songs showcasing many styles on the world fully knowing that this was the sort of album that all the commercial executives wanted the Velvets to make from the beginning..but it was a sad song and too late for that type of stardom.<br /><br />Their fame was posthumous and always beyond category and comparison.Loaded was an album of hits completing a cycle for the band that began with the Nico album, culminating into a collection of topnotch song craft smacking of beautiful songs and FM staples, songs you can rock and dance to.<br /><br />The story still requires their odds and sods collections Another View and VU and the live Robert Quine Tapes, the now 2 CD set Live At Max's and that extraordinary live 2 volume CD set 1969 recorded during this Loaded period.<br /><br />You won't be disappointed in their box \\"Peel Slowly And See\\" neither.
B000002UA7|4.0|Not really the whole story, of course.  More like 'the story so far', as at the end of the first decade of her three decade career.<br /><br />Kate had an astonishing debut.  On her first television appearance, singing Wuthering Heights, she was shaking with stage fright.  Also, for the time, she cut a rather bizarre (though very attractive) figure, as she used the mime training she had received at school to perform slow, graceful movements as an accompaniment to her very novel song.  She became an overnight star.  She was treated seriously from the start, giving art-program interviews rather than the usual pop DJ stuff.  She has remained an enigmatic and revered figure, on the fringes of the pop scene, ever since, plowing her own deep furrow.<br /><br />The version of Wuthering Heights on this album has a new vocal, with a cleaner, clearer sound.  At the time, there was much discussion on what the song was actually about.  So to that extent, this is 'the story so far, retold'.<br /><br />It is a story worth catching up with, because Kate is a unique and special talent, with an extraordinary vocal range.  This is music to be sat and carefully listened to.  The music owes more to imaginative and lush production rather than melodic strength, and the lyrics, on close inspection, are often facile and sometimes rather portentous.  But the complete package is always impressive.  The lyrics are available online and it increases your appreciation greatly if you have them to hand while listening.  As they are all story-based, you get even more out of them if you watch the videos, but I couldn't find many of her videos on DVD.  If you can find Babooshka on DVD, see it.  It's wonderfully erotic.
B000E1ZBGS|1.0|Just as the \\"modernized\\" version of Emma was entitled Clueless NOT  Emma, this movie should have been given another name. It may have nice scenes of the countryside and sweeping music but it is untrue to Austen's intent and the feel of her Pride and Prejudice. The story is choppy and feels rushed, no time for character development- and what you do see of the characters are totally off base from Austen's beautifully written ones.  Aside from a couple of decent performances (Judi Dench for one), the casting, acting, an writing are terrible.  Elizabeth's strong will and stubborness are portrayed by K. Knightly as impetuous temper and Darcy's restrained pride as sullen disdain that becomes pathetic when he inexplicably falls for her. There are SO many problems with this film as P&P- just watch the BBC version to see the difference. I was really excited to see this film and then was extremely disappointed! To those that say that this is a passable film if you don't pay that much attention to the actual story: then call it something else and don't get a P&P lover's hopes up!

1881273563|5.0|The author, Gary Chapman, does an excellent job of narrating his own book on tape.<br /><br />Chapman's thesis is, simply, that we all have a love tank, and it is best filled by one of 5 different love languages. If your spouse expresses his or her love to you in a love language that you don't speak than you will both be frustrated and your love tank will not be filled and eventually you will look for other ways to fill it.<br /><br />The five love languages are:<br /><br />-Quality Time<br /><br />-Words of Affirmation<br /><br />-Gifts<br /><br />-Acts of Service<br /><br />-Physical Touch<br /><br />Chapman provides plenty of concrete examples so that most listeners will be able to identify themselves or their spouse.<br /><br />He includes a section about expressing love to one's children as well using his love language theory.<br /><br />Very interesting. Makes total sense to me. I give this one an A.

B00005KB9T|5.0|\\"Catch a Fire\\" is an excellent debut album by the Wailers. All the original Wailers are there including Peter Tosh and Bunny Wailer. Their performance here is electric. The album was released in 1973 and it was this album that got me hooked to reggae music. This is the album that popularized reggae. Wailer fans will find this a treat. Listeners will enjoy the excellent instrumentation: the guitar, keyboards and percussion combined with gentle and soothing vocals to complete an exhilarating picture.<br /><br />The songs in the album address serious social and political issues. Some of the songs include \\"Slave Driver\\", \\"Concrete Jungle\\", \\"Stop that Train\\", \\"No More Trouble\\" and my favourite song on the album \\"Stir it Up\\".<br /><br />For me, this is the best and most creative album by the Wailers with its classic roots reggae. This is great music even for those that are not reggae fans. When I need to lift my spirits up, I play this album. I always feel better afterwards.
B000EULJLU|1.0|This latest release is WEAK and OVERRATED, period.  The rehashed songs are way too long, boring, plodding, and go nowhere, like most of TOOL's anemic and masturbatory schlock rock that poses as aural grandeur.  Maynard's vocals are way back in the mix, but this is probably a good thing.  But still watch the brainwashed cult-following 'Toolies' rant and rave about anything this musically stunted group of misfits releases!  It's also riotous to hear the 'Toolsheep' rave about the CD sleeve artwork, ostensibly just because it's on a 'TOOL' disc.  If the same artwork was on any other artist's CD, they would dismiss it or give it a lukewarm review.  'Nuff said.
B000000WA4|5.0|Following Siamese Dream is Mellon Collie and the Infinite Sadness, a two disk album containing 28 total songs and over two hours of material. As the title indicates, this album truly is \\"mellon collie\\" with the unforgettable chorus on bullet with butterfly wings of \\"despite all my rage i am still just a rat in a cage.\\" Billy Corgan's lyrics are highly angst-ridden, making the album a good listen for angry teenagers. Metal heads can even enjoy this album because of the aggresive nature of bullet with butterfly wings, an ode to no one, x.y.u, and several other songs. Alt-rockers will love the epic tonight, tonight thirty three and beautiful. Sure, on some songs Billy Corgan sounds too emotional but it is a testament of much effort he put into this album. Because of this, Mellon Collie is quite possibly the best album of the 1990's.
B000002JSR|5.0|You might think that I am just a big Zeppelin fan for writing that. Well, I am. But as a Zeppelin fan, I realize that Led Zeppelin was at their finest when live. Not \\"Song Remains The Same\\" live, but Led Zeppelin DVD live. If you will note that \\"We're Gonna Groove\\" and \\"I Can't Quit You Baby\\" from this album are the same recordings (with a little editing to remove some improv songs imbedded) as the first concert on DVD 1 of Led Zeppelin DVD (Royal Albert Hall - 1970). As such, you'll note how raw and how powerful just those 2 songs are. Then you get \\"Poor Tom\\" with the great back beat drum from Bonham. The bass line from Jonesy is absolutely great. \\"Walter's Walk\\" is out of the box raunchy blues rock. Not for the one looking for a cheery happy tune or background music. \\"Ozone Baby\\" is just a great rock song. It has the Zeppelin hard blues sound to it like Trampled Under Foot. \\"Darlene\\" has a funk to it that I can only compare with Elvis. When listening to this, I can't help but thinking this should have been an Elvis song. \\"Bonzo's Montreux\\" is a great drum track from Bonham, put in a context where it sounds like a real song of its own. And yes, the beginning of \\"Wearing and Tearing\\" can sound like punk, but I can't think of anything that it compares with. Maybe like the Wanton Song or In the Evening. <br /> <br />This album is for you only if you want to hear what Led Zeppelin was really all about. This was the album of rejects that turned out to be one of the greatest collections of musician rock (not pop rock) ever put together. If your bag is the Rolling Stones or Metallica, don't bother picking up this album, it is for those of us who play the guitar, bass or drums, or listen to bootlegs.
B0007OCG4W|4.0|This movie was good, at least in my opinion. Jude Law and Julia Robert's character's seemed less thoughout and unrealistic compared to Natalie and Owen strong presences. I loved these two charcters more for the vunerability that they showed then just for the fact that they both get screwed over by their love interests. I would recommend this movie for the performance rather than the plot, the overall atmosphere of the movie and of course the music.
B0006B2A2E|5.0|When I first saw the trailer of this movie I though \\"chick flix.\\" Then I read some reviews and a good friend told me \\"just watch it.\\" I am glad I did.  <br />This movie does what all movies should do. They use the art at their hands to tell a story the best way possible. I'm so tired of movies being just a book in film, but this one really takes the magic of the movies and brings it alive. Their use of special effects serves to tell the story, not sell a product like many of Hollywood's stupid junk, they are quick, simple and never overdone.  <br />Of course, the acting was flawless. The big surprise was the reversal of the typical roles of Jim Carrey and Kate Winslet, and they both do it perfectly.  <br />Buy it, rent it, ask it as a gift, anything, but watch it. You won't regret it.
B00009V8Z9|3.0|Gavin Degraw is an interesting artist to say the least. This album was okay but not good enough to recieve 5 stars There are 3 or 4 songs that a good and mainly the rest are okay ,but the lyrics for some of them were pointless and confusing. I hated Chemical Party!!! Other than that I would just keep listening for his songs on the radio or borrow the CD from a friend.
B000EJ9MTW|5.0|It seems that we're coming to an age where liking classic rock is cool again and many bands are trying to bring back that 60's and 70's vibe.  The problem is that few of the bands that try manage to do that very well, but Wolfmother is a definite exception.  To put it simply, they f***ing rock.   <br />For three guys, they manage to make a huge sound.  The riffs, the vocals, the music in general sounds like a blend of Beatles, Zeppelin, Sabbath and maybe even a little Who thrown in.  The best part is that all these influences are blended very well, able to bring all of these classic sounds together without blatantly ripping off any of these bands.  <br />Favorite tracks are Dimension, Woman, Joker and the Thief, Colossal, but really, there are no filler tracks on this cd.   <br />Check them out and spread the word, these guys really prove that rock is still alive.
B00004Y6NU|5.0|I've been very critical of 2000's music for a variety of reasons.   For the most part, my main criticism has been what I term a cookie-cutter guitar laden sound combined with un-improvising vocals and un-original lyrics.   Many times I've tried to look back and wonder if I am being too harsh on the sounds of the first decade of the 21st century.   Then into my collection comes Dire Straits and the album \\"Love Over Gold\\".   This is an album that is from the early 1980s.   In the early 1980s, many people were critical of the sounds of that period for different reasons - namely synth-pop.   However, when I listen to \\"Love Over Gold\\", this confirms that the music of the 2000s has been very bland, while at the same time time shows that the judgment of the 1980s sound was unfair.   Overall, \\"Love Over Gold\\" might be one of the best albums that many people never heard. <br /> <br />When you look at \\"Love Over Gold\\", you may think of this as an EP as opposed to a full-fledged album.  The reason is that this collection only contains 5 tracks.   However, you still get over 41 minutes of music on this collection.  There isn't a song that is shorter than 5 minutes and 50 seconds and the album's first track, \\"Telegraph Road\\" clocks in at 14 minutes.   I'm amazed at why this album was criticized for long tracks - this is what gives the album its charm. <br /> <br />Considering the lengths of the tracks on this collection and the complex instrumentation that makes up this album, many have considered this album a progressive rock album.   I tend to think the album has progressive rock elements to it.  While Dire Straits or lead vocalist, Mark Knopfler cannot be considered a full-fledged progressive rock artist; their style of music clearly is one that can lend them to producing something that contains progressive rock elements.   Much of Dire Straits is the result of the awesome guitar work of Knopfler, but there is also some great instrumentation from other band members such as bassist John Illsley.  In many circles, Knopfler is considered as good as they come. Knopfler has also proven himself to be a top-notch lyricist - writing both humorous and serious songs. The combination of outstanding instrumentation, great lyrics and a mix of many influencing genres is really what made Dire Straits such a great band.   Therefore, I wouldn't consider this progressive element something that is experimental, but something that is more of a natural progression for the band. <br /> <br />Here is a synopsis of the five tracks: <br /> <br />\\"Telegraph Road\\":  This is a song that is well-known among Dire Straits fans, but unfortunately the casual fan may not hear it as much because conventional radio tends to shy away from tracks that are 14 minutes long.   However, this song makes the most of every minute it plays.  This is a terrific song.   This song has more of an epic Rock feel (especially with the instrumentals) and the beginning is cut in the mold of the early days of Bruce Springsteen as opposed to a pure progressive rock sound.   In fact, the keyboards remind me a lot of how Springsteen integrates keyboards in his music.  The song has a narrative feel as it tells the story of the growth of a society.   The amazing thing is how Dire Straits integrates a bit of a Rockabilly fusion at the end of the song - something that is more of a trademark of Dire Straits (and this helps contribute to the progressive elements of the song). <br /> <br />\\"Private Investigations\\": This is another well-known song among Dire Straits fans and may have been heard by some casual fans.  This song is known for it's haunting elements.   The haunting element gives the song the strongest progressive feel of all the tracks.   Knopfler speaks the lyrics as opposed to sings them - helping to add to the \\"dark feel of the song\\".  Illsley's bass also adds to the dark feel.   At the same time, you can hear every note crystal-clear on this track.  At times the guitar work has a bit ofa Latin-style feel to it.  This song is a story told by someone who is a - private investigator. <br /> <br />\\"Industrial Disease\\":  The keyboards in the very beginning of this song almost remind me of a later song - \\"Walk of Life\\".  The one single released from this album, this sometimes gets overshadowed by the brilliance of \\"Telegraph Road\\" and \\"Private Investigations\\".   This song takes a lighter feel as opposed to the serious tones of the first two songs on the collection.   It has more of a traditional Dire Straits feel including a bit of a the trademark Rockabilly fusion.  The song takes a humorous look at the impacts of diseases resulting from the industrial revolution.   If you haven't heard it, this song will catch on quickly. <br /> <br />\\"Love Over Gold\\": This is the title track.   This is the one track that takes a while to catch on to, but each time you listen to it - it does begin to catch on.   Much of this reason is that this song has a slower pace.  The instrumentation is going to be the highlight of this song.   There are even some moments where I felt the guitar work had a bit of a Latin influence on it. <br /> <br />\\"It Never Rains\\":  This is actually the second longest collection the track.   While not as peppy as \\"Industrial Disease\\", this song also has its light moments. My favorite line is \\"And your new Romeo; was just a gigolo  when he let you down.\\"   The guitar work also reminds me a bit of the \\"Rockabilly\\" sound. <br /> <br />The liner notes include all of the lyrics to all each of the five tracks.   This may seem like a small collection of long songs - and it definitely is.  However, the quality of what is included in this collection far exceeds the sum of the parts.  Highly recommended.
0783232039|4.0|BRIDE OF CHUCKY breaths new life into the \\"Child's Play\\" franchise with it's doses of black comedy and the excellent work of new director Ronny Yu, who brings a fresh approach to the Chucky legacy.<br /><br />The story picks up several years after the bloodshed of \\"Child's Play 3\\", with Chucky's girlfriend Tiffany (Jennifer Tilly) stealing back the dismembered dolly from a gullible policeman and reviving him with a voodoo spell.  Tiffany aims to keep Chucky firmly imprisoned in her trailer, but he breaks free and murders her, then transports her spirit into a bridal doll.  Hitching a ride wih two lovesick teens (Katherine Heigl and Nick Stabile), the plastic-fantastic duo must reclaim a mystical amulet if they are ever to return to human form.<br /><br />This is very much more comedy than horror and is a completely enjoyable ride even if you weren't too impressed with the earlier \\"Child's Play\\" films.  Jennifer Tilly is hilarious as Tiffany and Brad Dourif once again voices Chucky with anarchic glee.  Katherine Heigl and Nick Stabile don't really do much except scream and look pretty, and are completely upstaged by their dolly co-stars.  The ending, of course, leaves the door open for yet another sequel (\\"Seed of Chucky\\", which I hope to review soon).<br /><br />Fabulous film.
B000F0UV0E|4.0|Starting with the opening track, \\"Beachcombing\\", this collaborative effort combines Mark Knopfler's signature sound and the graceful vocal talents of Emmylou Harris very effectively. Songs like \\"Rollin' On\\" and \\"Right Now\\" jump at you with their seductive tempo, and \\"Donkey Town\\" brings in a happy balance between Knopfler's rough-edged voice a-la-Jesse James and Harris' Belle Star softer nature.<br /><br />The album closes with the title track and \\"If This Is Goodbye\\", almost blending the overall country sound with a touch of celtic, rounding up the free spirit of the album and making it one of the most interesting collaborations I've listened to in a while. Granted that the album lacks what you could label a \\"high point\\", it still works in many ways. After a few listens, the result feels like one of those CDs that are perfect for the road.
0385474547|5.0|Chinua Achebe's THINGS FALL APART is like what HEART OF DARKNESS would have been if told through the eyes of an African.  The book emerses the reader into the lives of an African village and soon one is lost in the world Achebe created.  When the firt \\"white man\\" arrives, you feel the same shock, bewilderment, and later hatred that their arrival brings.  It's like an earthquake that destroys everything that you know and love.   <br /> <br />This novel perfectly shows the disasterous effects of colonization and most readers will empathize with the struggles of the natives.  This book should be required reading for everyone that agrees with invading another country to spread religion, democracy, values, or whatever else it believes it's doing in the name of righteousness.
B00000JCOV|5.0|This is the most deeply pissed-off metal I've ever heard in my life. I'm fortunate enough to own the original version of this CD with the track \\"Purity\\" on it. Corey's vocals are heartbreaking on that song, especially when he lets out that scream at the end, and it echoes and fades out. I was floored the first time I heard it.     Totally in your face from start to finish. A great album to lift weights to, and perfect for scaring the hell out of your vegan co-workers.
B00005B4GU|4.0|\\"Like Spinning Plates\\" has the track to \\"I Will\\" (from Hail to the Thief) played backwards (from Wikipedia.com).  So really, at least one of the tracks from the Kid A/Amnesiac recording sessions didn't make it onto an album for 2 to 3 years, not to mention all of the B-sides. <br /> <br />I think this rendition of \\"Morning Bell\\" is just as good as Kid A's, in a completely different way.  This version is something you'd hear in a nightmare - very haunting (with what sounds like a bassoon, possibly, in the left ear). <br /> <br />All in all, this is a solid album.
B000021YQV|5.0|First off, I think Serj has one of the most powerful and distinctive voices in metal today, and Daron is one of the guys responsible for bringing TONE back to modern metal guitar.<br /><br />A few of the standout qualities here are the ULTRA catchy songwriting, the ethnic melodies, the smart lyrics, and the sense of humor that is a breath of fresh air from many other bands, metal or not.<br /><br />I'm a very proud to say that this is the most FUN metal CD my collection. \\"Shimmy\\" your way to getting a copy.
0440178002|5.0|I can't say enough good things about this book, it is absolutely fantastic. I didn't want the book to end, even after 1200 pages! This is one of the best books I have ever read.
B00068NVI4|5.0|These fine gentlemen deserve nothing but our admiration and praise.  I cannot imagine my life experienced without the music of Yes!   <br /> <br />I was fortunate to have met them backstage at both of the shows I saw on this tour and can honestly say in addition to being an amazing band, they are gentlemen.  Wakeman hung out and talked with us forever.  Andersen was friendly.  Howe, was a bit shy - curious - one would think he would have a huge ego, but no, just a simply brilliant talent with a no B.S. class about him. Squire and White were great too.  No visible ego issues evident.   <br /> <br />I am honored to have met them and just glad I have experienced them for 35 years.  35 wonderful years in the family of Yes.  As a teen, my best friend and I referred to Close To The Edge as \\"The Album\\".  All one of us had to say was, let's listen to THE album.  To this day we refer to it as such.  It is a masterpiece - among the other masterpieces in their fine works.   <br /> <br />The other day, when I heard that Steve Howe, the baseball player, was killed in a car wreck, I immediately though that Steve Howe of Yes was killed and that was the end of the real YES.  I was really upset for a while until I heard it was not \\"our\\" Steve Howe that the report referred to.  <br /> <br />Let's hope these guys continue to have long healthy and prosperous lives for their sake and for ours.   <br /> <br />Buy this DVD, support Yes, wish them well, reward them for having a ton of class, for writing and performing music with meaning and grace, and for being an example to other musicians of today to see what real musicians are, what they sound like and how they act. <br /> <br />Yes is a band with a ton of class! I feel sorry for those un-enlightened that don't know their work.   For the rest of us, Enjoy! <br /> <br />Support Yes in all they do. <br /> <br />BTW, I think the DVD is excellent! <br /> <br /> <br />
B0000CABJ1|5.0|This album is a terrific compilation of Donna Summer's greatest hits. The album has primarily the disco songs that made her a smash success such as \\"Love To Love You Baby,\\" \\"Hot Stuff,\\" \\"Bad Girls,\\" \\"Last Dance,\\" and \\"Dim All The Lights.\\" You also get her classic duet with Barbra Streisand, \\"No More Tears (Enough Is Enough);\\" and a group called Brooklyn Dreams helped Donna out on background vocals for \\"Heaven Knows.\\" There are twenty (yes, twenty) songs on this single CD, so you don't get many 12\\" extended versions of the songs. To compensate for that loss, however, there is a second bonus CD included inside the jewel case with remixes of some great songs including \\"Hot Stuff,\\" \\"I Feel Love,\\" and \\"You're So Beautiful.\\"<br /><br />The remastering work was well done; the sound quality is excellent in both my regular CD stereo at home as well as in my portable CD player. This highlights the richness, sexiness and electricity in Donna's voice. Her voice is exciting and always leaves the listener wanting more!<br /><br />The liner notes are great. There's an extensive essay by Brian Chin, quite a few color photos of Donna, song credits and listings of where each song charted at its' peak of popularity after its' initial release. I also liked the excerpts from Donna's autobiography called Ordinary Girl: The Journey. The extra bonus CD comes inside the regular sized jewel case, however, so you need to carefully pull it out as to not break the plastic case. (They manufactured the CD jewel case this way to save a few bucks on production costs, no doubt.)<br /><br />Summer fans also hear her great \\"crossover\\" songs into something that is more like mainstream pop. You get \\"She Works Hard For The Money\\" and \\"This Time I Know It's for Real.\\" Donna performs a sublime rendition of \\"I Will Go With You\\" and there are two \\"new recordings\\" by Donna called \\"That's The Way\\" and \\"Dream-a-lot's Theme (I Will Live For Love).\\"<br /><br />Overall, the songs Donna sings are the best and this CD is excellent proof of that. The melodies are catchy and the musical arrangements impressed me. Congratulations are due both to Donna for her outstanding accomplishments in the field of music over decades of time and to the other people who helped produce this electric album.<br /><br />I highly recommend this album as an excellent starter album for people who want to get to be more familiar with Donna Summer's talent. This CD is also great for disco fans, pop fans and even fans of dance music in general.<br /><br />This album is called \\"The Journey, The Very Best Of Donna Summer,\\" as if they are somehow implying that Donna's work is done and this is some type of complete and final retrospective. However, I for one will bet that for Donna Summer, the journey to produce great exciting music is far from over.and this CD is excellent proof of that.

B000A3VTT8|5.0|I first saw this on TV many years ago and never forgot it. So I'm delighted to see it released on DVD at last, in an excellent transfer -- great sound and a vivid, detailed image. My only regret is that the performance was shot in 4:3. Although Ponnelle has some fun with the tight framing, having characters dart in and out of the picture, the ensemble scenes cry out for widescreen. (If other reviewers are correct, the frame is even tighter on the DVD than it was as originally shot and shown on VHS.)    Except for that, though, it's hard to imagine this version being surpassed. The cast is uniformly excellent, from Araiza standing out as a handsome, ardent young prince and von Stade as an absolutely believable and radiant Cinderella, down to the chorus of footmen who are so obviously having a good time. If this disc doesn't keep you smiling, you're made of stone.
B000EULJLU|5.0|Listening to Tool requires the attention of the listener.  A Tool CD is not one which you can toss in the player and let your mind drift away while the CD plays.  Each syllable of each lyric and each note from every instrument grabs your attention - if you allow it to. <br /> <br />Like some others I consider Lateralus to be the best work of at least the past 20 to 30 years.  However, it took me at least 20 listens to that CD before I could even begin to grasp what was going on.  Aenima is perhaps the second best work of the last 20 years, and it also required multiple listens (in fact I tossed the first copy of Aenima that I owned, bought a new copy a year later and it remains in regular rotation).  Compared to Lateralus and Aenima, 10,000 Days is perhaps a 4 star disc.  However, on its own merits it is clearly a 5 star record. <br /> <br />I was disappointed after the first listen. I was even more disappointed after I had listened to the record about five times.  After about 20 listens, however, I am again blown away by the genius of Tool.  Vicarious is a song that can wake the dead, Jambi and The Pot also kick some serious tush, and each of these are moved along with incredible, thoughtful lyrics.  Rosetta Stoned is a very unique song in which Tool took some chances that really work.  The narrative from the the person is this song is stunning.  The so-called \\"slower\\" songs are tremendously nuanced.  10,000 Days (really one 17 minute song) is a powerful song about Maynard's mother.  It moves and builds, and the passion of Maynard is evident.  Right in Two is also a powerful song that builds to a passionate climax.  <br /> <br />I hope it doesn't take another 5 years before there is another Tool CD.  I can't take my freaking ears off this CD.
B00005JO20|5.0|If film-maker Carl Denham - - as played by Jack Black - - were to remake KING KONG, it would likely be very much like Peter Jackson's version starring Jack Black himself:  Unnecessarily long, overstuffed with Thrilling Action Scenes, and totally unbelievable (as distinguished from totally incredible).  Black's attempts to carry over his nudge-nudge wink-wink arch persona from say, SCHOOL OF ROCK, fall as flat as if trudged upon by the Great Ape himself.  He plays essentially the same character here he always does (which is to say he isn't acting at all, really).  And it's completely misplaced.  And I know this is strictly fantasy, but after all that poor old Ann Darrow (Naomi Watts) goes through, you would think she would, at the very least, lose at the very least one of her shoes.  Or something.  Maybe a broken neck or two.  Jackson's LORD OF THE RINGS managed to sustain its awesomness over the course of its three lengthy parts; KING KONG has woefully little to be remembered for after the course of its three interminable hours.  It isn't that the acting is particularly poor (but if you don't like Jack Black, avoid as this is actually KING KONG STARRING JACK BLACK).  It isn't that the special effects aren't particularly special.  I guess it's just a matter of overkill and oversaturation.  If you've seen LOTR or JURASSIC PARK or - - heck, the original KING KONG - - this version is just tiresome.  Many of the best scenes happen to be the quietest, actually, as if by accident the film isn't trying to call attention to itself.  Imagine that.
B000EJ9MTW|4.0|ummm first and foremost the hype behind this was led zeppelin meets black sabbath   almost true, But it is more deep purple with some hints of sabbath and zeppelin gets mellow in spots but then they tear it up  they can really jam like it was 1975 circa deep purple and sabbath, Way enjoyable if you want to go back 30 years,   but still cant wait to see them on their U.S.A. tour any way great stuff indeed

B000AJJNPY|5.0|Really Great music contained on this CD. These guys are so great. Their music just takes you to places within your self. So many moods and sounds to keep your mind occupied and the lyrics fill things in perfectly. I've heard some people say,that Sigur Ros sounded like Radiohead and Bjork, I actually liked both to a certain degree, so I bought this album. I am a dedicated fan of music. My tastes cover a wide variety of genres of music. Having said this, I can tell you in all confidence that Takk is absolutely the best album I have heard in a long time. By the way, you can get a lot of free songs from this band on their website. If you're not sure if you will like it that might be a good place to start. If you have an open mind, I think you will like this music.
0679422714|5.0|I arrived in Taiwan to learn Chinese on the very day that Lin Biao's plane crashed in Mongolia. I did my undergrad and graduate work here; nobody expected Taiwan to last that long. My interests are in Bronze Age China, so I am not an expert on modern history. However, I have translated documents from both the PRC and ROC governments, and have known so many people who have lived through the events described in this book that I am familiar with the period. I felt many parts were out of kilter. Chang and Halliday truly tell the unknown story, and straighten out the history.<br /><br />For example, the relationship between Chiang Kai Shek and Chiang Chingkuo never made sense before; now we see. Edgar Snow's descriptions of Mao always sounded like a junior high school boy talking about the pretty girl in the next class. I love the way they call him \\"Mao's American spokesman.\\"<br /><br />My experience has been that Chinese are extremely reasonable, but during the Cultural Revolution, it seemed that the whole country went crazy. That has always puzzled me. Reading this book, I suspect that they were reacting against the terror and starvation inflicted by Mao.<br /><br />There are plenty of shockers. For Chinese, the greatest shock may be Mao's role in WWII; he did not fight the Japanese, and his attitude is jolting. Americans will want to know more about Mao's role in encouraging Ho Chi Minh to fight. Although I saw unexploded Chinese shells used in Viet Cong attacks after the 1973 \\"cease fire,\\" even Bernard Fall seems not to have been aware that there were Chinese soldiers at Dien Bien Phu. The authors pile up so much evidence that it would be hard to refute their assertions. Even if what they write were only one percent true, Mao would still be a monster.<br /><br />With so much to write about, some parts are brushed over. The Korean War is discussed without mention of Macarthur, which actually may just about be right. I wish something had been said about how Mao used simplified characters to blind people to literature.<br /><br />I have a few quibbles. Page 459 refers to `fragrant intestines.' That is simply `sausage' in Chinese. Why not say sausage, then? Thrice they say Mao used the imperial `we'. There is no imperial `we' in Chinese, only chen/zhen, the first person singular pronoun reserved for the exclusive use of the emperor. Did Mao actually go that far? Just what did he say?

B000002IZM|5.0|Vangelis created one of the most seamless soundtracks ever for Bladerunner. His music and textures mixed with the brilliant production design of Syd Mead, and the Direction of Ridley Scott to create one of the most immersive and unique cinematic realms ever to be realized. <br /> <br />It is a sham that Vangelis' work on this film was not even nominated for an Oscar! I highly recommend this CD even if you have not seen the film. The atmospheres that Vangelis creates are absolutely stunning.
B0002EQ7E2|5.0|What is it about great musical artists when they age?  Why do so many of them seem to lose their original voice and talent?  And why do others, Costello, Young, Davies seem to be able to keep things fresh and real?<br /><br />Paul Simon, is constantly rediscovering music it seems.  The explosion of Graceland is the ultimate definer of this.  Here was an album that was completely new.<br /><br />Now it's been rereleased, surely to drum up attention to his latest album \\"Surprise\\", with improved sound quality and special packaging.<br /><br />But, the songs are still the same.  Excellent works.<br /><br />Paul Simon is one of the most respected song crafters of modern music.  His influence on other younger musicians is profound.  Consider indie darlings like the Shins, Fountains of Wayne, and School for the Dead.  Want to hear how Paul has influenced the next generation?  Try the song \\"Held His Gaze\\" from Henning Ohlenbusch (School for the Dead's frontman) on his solo disc, \\"[[ASIN:B000E1ZJ6U Looks Like I'm Tall]]\\".  It's all there: Simon's smooth chord changes, soaring melodies, and sung spoken easiness of intricate and evocative lyrics.<br /><br />It's all over Graceland.  Simon's natural unaffected voice tells stories and lulls imaginations into his own world of rhythmic harmonic newness.  It's still new now however many years later.<br /><br />Graceland is the sounds of summer.  Hello sunlight, my old friend.
B000EULJLU|5.0|Been a fan since I heard Sober in 1993. Wow, I cannot say enough about how much I love this album. It is truly a work of art that unveils itself after numerous listens. This is truly a worthy follow-up to Aenima. Lateralus was great, but not quite up to usual Tool standards. This, however, is fantastic. The first five tracks are tool at their finest. Tracks 6-10 are more challenging but once they sink in it is extremely powerful. I am addicted to this CD...Absolutely brilliant.
B00005JOIH|4.0|\\"Munich\\", written by Tony Kushner and Eric Roth, based on the novel by George Jonas; directed by Steven Spielberg.<br /><br />It's winter, and that means Oscar season, and that means Serious Films. The studios trot out their takes on weighty, uncommercial subject matter in search of Best Picture gold. Many Oscar-bound films tend to stiffen and dehydrate under the strain between their sombre content and accommodating their audience. \\"Munich\\" is not one of them.<br /><br />On the surface, Spielberg has made an extremely accomplished and emotional thriller, but beneath its gleaming exterior is something more. \\"Munich\\" is not about supporting political actions or taking sides. It's about the motives and justifications that lead one down a path of vengeance - a path that ultimately has no end, along the way destroying many of the goals and values meant to be preserved.<br /><br />It's the story of Avner, son of a military hero (and new father himself) who is offered the job of leading a covert team to assassinate the leaders of Black September. This group was behind the 1972 massacre of eleven Israeli atheletes during the Munich Olympics. Initially Avner rejects the offer, but reconsiders to get his family off to a better financial start.<br /><br />The body of the film, then, involves Avner and his four-man team zeroing in on eleven targets within or involved with Black September. The missions begin simply - a man is shot dead in his apartment house lobby - but become increasingly messy and complicated as the story progresses. More and more people are killed with less and less connection to the team's purpose, and Avner himself becomes increasingly desensitized and haunted by his tasks. It also becomes clear that there is a network of political groups, all with conflicting goals of their own, each being motivated to ever-escalating violence as their paths collide. Naturally, it becomes increasingly difficult to know who to trust, or to justify what trust may exist.<br /><br />In the end, Avner's trust disappears. His dreams of home and family are forever changed - he lives as a New York exile, brewing in constant fear of retribution by the groups he's attacked. His horrors of the original massacre continue undiminished, and the men he trusted are either dead or have withdrawn back into the shadows. The political targets that he eliminated have been replaced by ones all the more resolved by his violence. Little has changed. It's one of the best endings to a Spielberg film in recent memory. It's easily his best film since \\"Schindler's List\\".<br /><br />The performances are strong across the board, particularly Bana and Geoffrey Rush as his superior, Ephraim. The storytelling (with Janusz Kaminski's cinematography leading the way) is extremely visual, quite an accomplishment considering the amount of exposition needed for this type of picture. John William's score is restrained and sensitively used, helping to support the emotional currents of the film. Tony Kushner and Eric Roth's screenplay is even-handed, eloquent, and even humorous at times. There are parallels (handled well) that can be made to our current situation - our post 9/11 actions are echoed within this story as a larger history, one with a troubling legacy.exist.  <br /> <br />In the end, Avner's trust disappears.

B000DZIGDU|3.0|Jarhead is a movie based on the book of the same name, written by Anthony Swofford. Swofford was a sniper in the Gulf War conflict and he wrote his book as a collection of memoirs, describing the day to day occurrences while fighting in this short war.<br /><br />This movie is based on Swofford's true story and it lets the viewer see what it was like to be a marine in the Gulf War, from the perspective of one man and his recounting of the events. Jake Gyllenhaal plays Swofford in the movie and he offers his thoughts by narrating the movie at different points, allowing the viewer to better understand the thoughts that pass through a man's head when death and destruction are just around the corner.<br /><br />One thing about Jarhead that makes it different from other war movies is the lack of much combat action. There are only a few shooting and fighting scenes and they are not very graphic at all. This could be a letdown for those who watch this movie hoping to see violence, blood, and gore. There isn't much of this, and the movie often drags along at a slower than usual pace for this type of movie.<br /><br />If this movie isn't about combat, then what exactly is it about? Well, it is basically a film about the utter boredom of war- the majority of the hours of each day when there is nothing going on and nothing to do. The viewer gets to observe the men as they look for ways to fill the time in each day. They talk about sex. They talk about politics. They talk about sex. They talk about their girlfriends or wives back home. And they talk about sex some more. Stuck in a combat zone with other men, the guys have to find some way to fill the hours of the day and this movie concentrates its efforts on this aspect of war: What goes on when there is no armed conflict taking place and the soldiers have to find ways to occupy their time.<br /><br />Parts of this movie move very slowly but these slow moments are sometimes interrupted with military action when the enemy draws near. These action scenes, however, don't come even close to the brutal, high- powered action scenes of other war movies. Director Sam Mendes wanted to keep the emphasis of Jarhead on the boredom, since this is what filled the bulk of the day for the men fighting in the Gulf War.<br /><br />Performances in this movie are generally very good, with Jake Gyllenhaal, Jamie Foxx, and Peter Saarsgard leading the way. There is lots of abrasive language in this movie, and much of it is supplied by Jamie Foxx as he attempts to train and lead his troops. The rough language is the main reason this movie earned its \\"R\\" rating since the violent scenes are few.<br /><br />Jarhead has a large cast of characters, but you don't really get to know them on a personal level. The only person you really get to know is Anthony Swofford himself. You get to experience his feelings and thoughts through his own narration and through his own actions. But you don't get to know much at all about the other characters and this fact is one of Jarhead's strengths and weaknesses. It is a strength because it keeps the focus of the film on its core premise (the boredom of war and how soldiers deal with it) rather than on the personal lives of the characters themselves. But at the same time, this could be perceived by some viewers as a weakness because many of the characters seem very empty and underdeveloped. I didn't like this aspect of the film at first, but I accepted it more as the film dragged on.<br /><br />Because of the slowness of this movie and its scattered theme, it seems at times like a movie lacking direction. When I viewed it for the first time, I kept waiting for something to happen and I couldn't understand why Mendes didn't insert more action into some of the scenes. Like with the unknown characters, this is how Mendes intended Jarhead to be. No one person comes across as a hero; no vivid scenes of combat are shown; and no important political messages are shared. This is war at its dullest, but according to Swofford's book and the accounts of others who served in the Gulf War, this is pretty much the way it was.<br /><br />More than a movie about combat, Jarhead is a war movie about a man and his day to day experiences. This isn't a great war movie and I can think of many other war films that rank higher on my all time list. But it does offer an interesting perspective, showing how the endless hours with nothing to do can drive a soldier just as crazy as the time spent fighting the enemy.ullest, but according to Swofford's book and the accounts of others who served in the Gulf War, this is pretty much the way it was.<br /><br />More than a movie about combat, Jarhead is a war movie about a man and his day to day experiences.

B0000C6E4D|2.0|Too boring to ever really loathe, McLachlan has long remained on that cusp of mediocrity and frustration - hints of beauty surface here and there every few years, but the compendium is always the same - dull songs, listless vocals, uninspiring and lazy musical arrangement. Nothing here as breathtaking as `Ben's Song' or `Possession' or `Do What You Have To Do', but we have a host of replicates of the dreaded `Angel' and `Into The Fire' and `Solace' and any other countless fungible melodies from her pretty-enough canon. She might or might not be a hack, but if she is, she's a fancy hack.  My grade:  C+
B000EULJLU|5.0|When I first heard \\"Vicarious\\" I thought - \\"generic, same-old, same-old.\\"  I still think it is pretty much a re-tread of their earlier stuff, BUT...from that point on the CD is...amazing and a clear step forward for Tool.  The group is incorporating more aural inputs and has mellowed its edge just a bit, but I consider that a very good thing.  Even most of the so-called \\"filler\\" cuts are exceptionally fine. <br /> <br />For those who complain about the cuts being too long, I have one term - short attention span.  It is a literal disease of younger listeners (I am 55 so I know of what I speak).  I have always compared Tool to King Crimson, the spaced-out, hard-edged prog rock group from the 60s/70s.  Tool, however, rocks much harder and more consistently and the drumming is out of this world. <br /> <br />PS - If you like your cuts short but still rock-solid, go listen to Fifty Reasons To Explode by Schatzi.
B000301YY8|5.0|I went out and got this album this year after becoming addicted to the single you're Beautiful.... And my only regret was not picking it up sooner! Wow this record is amazing!  <br /> <br />The first thing I noticed about James, was his voice.... the fact that it's unmistakable which is quite refreshing in these times when everyone tends to have a similar sound, but not this guy. Some might think that his voice is a little weird but to me it's the kind of voice that is filled with emotion and takes the lyrics of these songs to a higher level and whole new meaning. James really gets in deep with the songs and it shows on each song that makes up this album...each of which is simply fantastic and can be listened to repeatedly without growing tiresome. <br /> <br />As mentioned before.... All the tracks here are fantastic but the highlights include; High, Tears and Rain, Out of my mind, Cry, No Bravery and the deeply emotional Goodbye my Lover. (I just realized that I've listed just over half the album but these songs are really good!) <br /> <br />One of the things that easily makes this one of the most played albums in my collection is you get the entire package... I mean sometimes an artist comes along that has a great voice but the songs that they sing just don't make use of that instrument and showcase their talent, other times they might have great songs in terms of lyrics but when they sing them.... It's not as moving because they don't have the voice needed to make it. This is NOT the case with James...the lyrics couldn't be better and his voice works really well to give you one hell of an experience.... one that you'll want to experience over and over.... This is what music is supposed to be like! <br /> <br />Also, there is the fact that this record is made of different types of songs...lyrically and instrumentally which also makes for a great listen because there is no way you can get bored. There are lighthearted tracks like Wisemen and So long Jimmy which are not as heavy as some of the other tracks on here, but the beats are addictive and just fun! <br />Then there are the heavier more emotional tracks like Cry (amazing!) and No Bravery the closing track that left me blown away the first time I listened to this album. There is a raw emotional feel to the last track that really shows James' talent, and is a fitting note to close out a great album!! <br /> <br />If I had to find one complaint about this album is that it is TOO SHORT! I mean come on! You cant give us this great talent in such a small dose...but hey this is just his debut album and I'm certain he'll be around for years to come...so until then I guess I'll just have to keep hitting that repeat button! <br /> <br />If you're tired of hearing the same artists singing the same thing year after year...give this album a try.... but just a warning...you might become addicted. Great job James!! <br />
0425170349|3.0|I won't discuss the plot; the thousand other reviews cover that in sufficient detail. What doesn't seem to be mentioned to an appropriate extent is the extent to which the book's hamfisted politics undermine its several strengths. <br /> <br />As someone reading from outside of the United States, it's painfully obvious to see that the book was written for those within the USA, by those within the USA. Clancy's knowledge of technical detail on weaponry is superb, except when those weapons are owned by countries outside of the US, his descriptions of Canadian weapons fraught with inaccuracies. His settings are often effective and easy to visualise, but when he ignores the difference in seasons between Australia and Britain, these visualisations are cheapened. Even the British characters, central to the book, say \\"chap\\" and smoke pipes. As an author, Clancy reinforces all of the stereotypes of the ignorant American that those Americans so resent. <br /> <br />The antagonists in the novel, a radical environmentalist group, are a crude negative representation of the political left. The brute-force, gun blazing, America-rules-OK methods of dealing with them leave no questions as to Clancy's political convictions. His subtlety in discussing technology is great; the reader is forced to ask why the same intricacy isn't applied to politics. <br /> <br />For anybody with moral or political insight, Rainbow Six is an often exciting book undermined by Clancy's crude political agenda, making it uncomfortable and embarassing to read. The fact that so few reviewers have highlighted this makes one wonder if the aforementioned resented stereotypes are more accurate than America would like to admit.
B000EULJLU|5.0|There has never been a band like Tool.  The only hard rock band with the talent to pull off something as ambitious as Aenima or Lateralus was the Who in their masterpiece, Quadrophenia.  The Who never attempted anything so ambitious again, but 10,000 Days is Tool's third consecutive masterwork.   <br />  Stravinsky wrote the Rite of Spring in the early 1900's and brought rhythm to the fore in serious music.  The Rite of Spring famously caused a riot at its premiere in Paris, but it successfully dragged the public down a new road paving the way for Prokofieff, Bartok and a wave of modern composers who used rhythm in ways unimagined in the 19th Century. <br />   Tool is the Stravinsky of modern music, and 10,000 days is driven by an onslaught of rhythmical expression as intense as in their prior albums.  It is too soon to say where 10,000 days ranks in comparison to Lateralus and Aenima -- it is probably pointless to rank works of such extraordinary complexity.
B000B8QEZG|5.0|With Confessions On A Dance Floor Madonna brings back those good old dance days. This is a very energetic and great dance album.
B0006M4SO6|3.0|The Way Up is the type of music that is ultimately enjoyable and listenable, but requires a significant amount of effort by the listener to achieve this. It seems like a fair amount of music produced by PMG over the years falls into this catagory and whether that is good or bad is a matter of personal preference. As for me, I'm starting to get weary of the effort.    Although I don't so much agree with Gavin's out-of-hand assessment of the pointlessness of the many key and time changes, I do agree with a sentiment he broaches: Oh, for the good ol' days of ECM. Oh, what I would give to have a work from PMG with the same creative barb of Watercolors that so completely and EFFORTLESSLY captivates the musical imagination. It's been a long time.    Ultimately TWU is good piece of work with an interesting mix of urban urgancy (it starts off sounding like bumper music to some national newscast) progressive rock guitar-type hooks (a la Half Life of Absolution) and general quirkiness (Vu does some very odd things with his trumpet), but I just feel the need to vent the sentiment that previous PMG works of long ago have been so much better.    The result is an almost 70 minute long (it's too bad Watercolors couldn't have been 70 minutes) contiguous composition that requires probably as much effort to enjoy as it did to create - and the payoff is not nearly what other works by PMG have been. I wonder how many listeners there are out there who are UP to this kind of challenge. For now, I still am.    If you are listening Pat, please pick up your oddly tuned Guild Starfire 12-string guitar again and compose something like Icefire just one more time...
B000EULJLU|5.0|IF there is one thing I like about TOOL, it's that all of their albums give off their own atmosphere. You never quite know what to expect with this band and therefore you always get mixed reviews about this eccentric collection of mezmerizing musicians. The beauty of this album is the ambiance of Mayard's voice mixed with melodic/experimental guitar and rhythm work that is evident in every single song on the album.<br /><br />10,000 days is a mature step up from Lateralus that deserves more than one listen before being thrown out the window.<br /><br />Highlights of the album set the mood for tracks that fallow. Those highlights are:<br /><br />Jambi<br /><br />10,000 Days<br /><br />Rosetta Stoned<br /><br />Right in Two
