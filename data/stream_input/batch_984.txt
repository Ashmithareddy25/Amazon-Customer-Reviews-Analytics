B001PA0FFO|4.0|See this movie only if you enjoy a film where the acting and writing is way above average, and only if you are in the mood for a film that will induce thought. This is not a movie to settle down with if you just want to be entertained for the evening. It's basically a quiet character study about conflicting people (although it does get fairly tense and emotional at times).<br /><br />I grew up in the 1970's and went to Catholic school; it was a decade after this film's time period but not much had changed, believe me. I was used to all the trappings of the church and of nuns and priests. I was not an altar boy but I was exposed to the traditions and experiences that are seen in this film. I would imagine that someone who is not familiar with these things at all might find some aspects of this movie to be almost foreign in certain ways. But a viewer need not be familiar with Catholicism (or even with the Bronx in 1964) to appreciate this movie.<br /><br />The four principles give outstanding performances, particularly Meryl Streep and Viola Davis (Davis has just one major scene, and she is excellent in it). Streep owns the movie as the conflicted and multifaceted Sister Aloysius; this is probably the most relentless and stubborn woman in cinema since Nurse Ratched in \\"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest\\" in 1975 (played by Oscar-winner Louise Fletcher). I was fascinated with this character, and torn over how I felt about her. She can be considered a heroine and also a villain at the same time. It's hard to explain. She can be strict, unfair, caring, funny, impatient, and cold. And it's no surprise that this would be another (her sixteenth) Oscar nomination for Meryl Streep. She never stops creating authentic characters. In \\"Doubt\\", her mannerisms, body language, accent, and expressions were all spot-on.<br /><br />The film is sometimes ambiguous, particularly the final scene. Some things are left to the audience to wrestle with and to interpret. I enjoyed that the story becomes much more than a mystery, that it becomes more about a person's choices and judgments and decisions. Kudos to playwright and director John Patrick Shanley for making this powerful film.a mystery, that it becomes more about a person's choices and judgments and decisions.

0060775858|5.0|I've been giving Goodnight Moon as a gift to newborns and young children for about 25 years now and never met a child or parent who didn't love it. It's an all time classic children's book and has won a many awards in the children's book categories. It's an all time favorite and simply an imaginative, wonderful, and compelling read for a child. Diseptively simple: saying Good Night to familiar objects page after page. In no time at all, the child chimes in with her/his goodnight. A pure classic.
B002S0OBN2|5.0|I have always loved the Phantom's story in all its incarnations & various media interpretations. It's just a story that's always fascinated me & that I identify closely with. I have been in love with the oriiginal \\"Phantom of the Opera\\" musical since I heard it for the 1st time, somewhere around 1990. The day I finally saw it on Broadway was the day I knew my life was complete. Yeah; I'm a fan (Phan).<br />Then the other day I saw a TV ad for the CD set for this sequel, which I never even knew was in the works. I immediately jumped online to hunt it down. Now I have just finished listening to it for the 1st time & all I can say is WOW. That's it. All other words escape me in trying to describe it. Just....WOW! The music, the story, the performers...wow!<br />Never have I seen a movie or read a book whose sequel has truly been able to do the original justice, until now. (I don't include multi-part movie series or book series. I refer to sequels that were decided on after the fact - the ones that suck 98% of the time). It maintains the original musical's plot integrity, musical style & general mood but doesn't reinvent the wheel, so to speak. It is definitely a continuation of the story & one must have a good working knowledge of the first in order to trul appreciate it. I wouldn't say it is better than or even equal to the original but it really competes to be as great. I can't wait to see the actual show, which has already begun in London & will come to Broadway in Nov. 2010. It's my new life goal - to see this show with its original cast!<br />All Phantom fans owe it to themselves to get this soundtrack. You'd be doing yourself a great disservice if you didn't, honestly.
0307271862|3.0|I have been enjoying the Wallander books, so I was looking forward to this new book by Mr. Mankell. Unfortunately, it did not live up to my expectations.<br /><br />It begins quite well, with an entire village of elderly people slaughtered for no apparent reason. After that, it begins to go steadily downhill. The protagonist is not a detective, but a female judge who puts herself right into the midle of the police investigation. Despite being told to stop getting involved, she continues to dig around for the reason for the killings, and that's what makes the story somewhat unravel.<br /><br />The author appears to be more interested in writing about politics and Communism than getting on with the plot, and it gets bogged down rather easily. It's a globe-spanning book, going from Sweden to Denmark, to Britain, to the United States, to China, to Zimbabwe and Mozambique. Too much travel and not enough substance.<br /><br />In the end, of course, the reader learns the reason for the killings, and even if it makes very little sense it does bring the book to a conclusion. I hope Mr. Mankell has now satisfied his urge to write about political things, and can get back to what he does best, writing thrillers and police procedurals.

B001PPLIEG|2.0|After seeing Casino Royale, I decided the new Bond was okay. I liked the more serious Bond and Daniel Craig did an admirable job. But The Quantum Solace was a big disappointment.  Nothing hung together. You didn't know what was going on half of the time and the acting was below average as was the directing. It was like most action films today, just a lot flash and nothing more. Was this a Bond Film? This is a good time for Bond to die and be gone forever.
0743455967|5.0|Who is Stephen King? How does he do what he does? What's going on in his mind? King is prolific and he has millions of fans, but On Writing might just be his best work. He reveals himself candidly, telling the story of his life in a way that does honor to his craft. He is also quite honest about his belief that many people will never be writers, even if they want to be. The book is aptly named \\"a memoir.\\" It's not a book on how to write, per se--but because King is King, his memoir is inevitably informative about what goes into being an author. I will read this book again.
B002SF9YUM|3.0|Decent film, with a really nice music track. If one has read Dali's autobiography, and a couple other pieces on him, Pattinson's portrayal seems pretty spot on..........quirkey, but then, this is Dali! Solid British actors fill out the cast.
B002T921AC|1.0|Having heard all this hype over this Justin Bieber fellow, I one day decided to check his music out.I went onto youtube and listened to the first song that came up and was shocked. It was the single most abysmal thing I had ever heard in my life. Another thing that surprised me was that I had heard this song before on the radio... and assumed it was a female singer using synthesizers. Well, dang. I wondered what the hype could possibly had been about, and searched a couple more songs that ended up being equally bad to \\"One Time\\" before I gave up. This boy (And I use that in the loosest possible terminology) has no talent whatsoever. Having heard his songs, I get the impression of listening to a three year old girl speaking into auto tune. A three year old girl with a voice higher than Alvin and the Chipmunks. All in all, I was surprised at first, but after this last decade of pure garbage being churned out by the music industry, I've gotten used to it. It's disappointing that auto tune and photoshopping someone's picture to make them \\"Cute\\" is enough to create a music \\"sensation\\" these days. Oh well, at least I still have my music from the good old days.

B0029LHW4U|2.0|A new singer requires a new- or at least modified- style of sound.  William Duvall is a decent rock vocalist but he's not cut out for droning, downtuned grunge.  He just doesn't have the personality.  Duvall's style of singing would fit well with the songs off Facelift, as that album was much more 80s hard rock than grunge.  For this record, AiC should have gone back to that style; shorter songs with faster tempos and less filler riffs.    Juding the album as it is, it's merely okay.  The best songs are typically the shorter ones that are solidly structured.  These include Check My Brain, Your Decision, Take Her Out, and Black Gives Way to Blue.  The one exception is Private Hell, which clocks in at around five and a half minutes, but is pretty good nonetheless.      Unfortunately, the rest of the album falls short.  All Secrets Known goes absolutely nowhere.  Last of My Kind, A Looking In View, and Lesson Learned sound like rejected tracks from Degradation Trip and are completely unremarkable and plodding.  When the Sun Rose Again is a weak attempt at a Jar of Flies-like ballad.  Acid Bubble is okay; it has a great chorus, but is far too long for its own good (no AiC song should be nearly seven minutes in length) and has an awful post-chorus shoutfest.    If AiC does a follow-up album then Jerry Cantrell needs let William Duvall actually sing the songs.  Furthermore, they should be songs that he can sing well; no more six-minute sludge marathons.  Keep the songs uptempo and moderately brief, and bring back the blistering guitar solos.  Enough of this overlong droning stuff.  Bring back the rock.

0142406112|4.0|I am 38 years old, but I have a young cousin who has read all the Alex Rider books, and I decided to read them myself so that the two of us would have something to talk about the next time he visits.    Having read all of the original James Bond novels by Ian Fleming, I was amused by how Anthony Horowitz pays homage to Fleming even in small ways, such as the chapter titles and character names like Alex Rider's alias \\"Felix Lester,\\" which is clearly a play on Bond's CIA buddy, Felix Leiter, in the Fleming novels.  I was especially amused at the villains, whose names (like those of Fleming's characters) have an exotic, menacing, or ironic touch, such as the severely scarred \\"Mr. Grin\\" (a man w/ a permanent smile carved into his face) and Nadia Vole (a \\"vole,\\" of course, being a rodent).  I also got a kick out of Alex's souped-up bike, which Horowitz describes much like Fleming might describe Bond's specially modified car.  Such homages to Fleming make Stormbreaker fun even for adult readers.    Although a little slow at first (obviously, since this is the first book, Horowitz has to flesh out his characters a bit before getting to the meat of the plot), Stormbreaker nevertheless has its fair share of action and suspense.  The action scenes are well-written.  I especially liked Alex's confrontation with the giant jellyfish.  I will say, however, that the ending seemed a bit disjointed and not as climactic as it could have been.    I was a bit surprised by the level of violence in this book, not b/c I think that it might warp a young reader's mind or that kids need \\"protection\\" from fictional violence.  I just would've thought that in this day of hyper-sensitivity and political correctness, the publishers would tone down the violence in order to avoid angering parents.  I'm glad to see they didn't give in to this fear.  I'm not sure that young teens (boys in particular, who no doubt comprise the vast majority of Horowitz's fan base) are really THAT delicate.    All in all, Stormbreaker is a good read, and I look forward to the next book in the series.

Her mother beats her with a flower pot. It is a sad movie. The mother is so cruel.     My favorite part is when the Jamaican girl say, \\"My favorite color is purple in Jamaican.\\" I laughed so hard that I rolled off my movie theater seat. I said, \\"That was funny!\\" I was at the theater with my mom.     If your mom or dad or sibling wants to rent a movie and you are not sure, Precious is the best movie.

B002UNMW7O|3.0|When I first heard they were making a sequel to this classic, I said, \\"oh hell no. How are they going to butcher it?\\"  And when it was finally released in theaters, a chorus of mixed reviews rang out.<br /><br />But to be honest, I didn't hate it.<br /><br />The Saints are back, (Norman Reedus and Sean Patrick Flanery), lured out of their hiding place in Ireland by a copycat killer.  Julie Benz (from the Showtime hit \\"Dexter\\") is the new Agent Smecker, if you will, and I found her quite expendable.  Her character was helpful to the boys in the same way that Smecker was but not to the same passionate level.  If she wasn't in the movie, it wouldn't have been such a horrible thing.  No offense to Ms. Benz, since I think she did a great job with the role she was given, but the role could have been left on the cutting room floor and we would have been none the wiser, especially since we had the trio of detectives from the last film, (yes, including Greenley), to help the Saints get their revenge under the legal radar.<br /><br />Romeo (Clifton Collins, Jr.) is the newest addition to the entourage and he is enjoyable, although at times he tries to be laugh-out-loud funny and I just wasn't feeling it.  But he brought a new spin to the Rocco-type vibe we had in the first film.  David Della Rocco even makes a few cameo appearances as the spirit of Rocco, letting the boys know that he is still with them in spirit.<br /><br />Billy Connolly returns as well for the sequel and this film delves into a deeper back story on him, explaining why he was in jail in the first place and how he is connected to everything.  This film feels more like a prequel of questions answered that we might not have needed answered in the first place.  Some things are better left un-overexplained.<br /><br />All in all, the humor is still there and there are a few action-packed scenes that support the kick-assness of the first film.  But it was definitely a bit lackluster.  Judd Nelson as the new villain, (i.e. Yakavetta's son), was kind of a snooze fest, at times almost even painful to watch.

B002WY65VU|4.0|Okay, I am not going to echo so much of what has been said before so I will just say this. This is a fun, gory and exciting movie with zombies and not a zombie movie. Why? Well for one simple reason. And no, it has nothing to do with these zombies simply being infected. 28 Days Later had \\"infected\\" and its a good zombie movie. Any good \\"Zombie Movie\\" has zombies at the fore. Zombies permeate the world in which the protagonists try to survive in and zombies are a credible threat. The thought of the zombie threat are never far from the characters minds and, hence, never far from the viewers'. This world, aka \\"Zombieland\\" seems mostly empty with only the occasional ghoul popping up to remind us that, \\"Hey, this isn't just an after the fall of civilization, film.\\" Except mostly, it is. Now, I know the finale had a LOT of zombies, but that was mostly due to the stupidity of two of the main characters. 'Nuff said. Now this is not to say I didn't enjoy this film. All of the characters were great and it is always good to see Woody in something. The Bill Murray cameo was, in a word, fantastic and the film is full of laughs without being simply a silly, over-the-top comedy.    You may be asking, \\"Why did you even bother to write this review if you're going to just hate on its zombie aspect.\\" Well, I want to let anyone that is looking for a zombie film, understand that this really isn't one of them. Good? Yes. Funny? Yes. Entertaining? Yes. Zombie Film? No, only a film with zombies in it. Okay, you might balk over the distinction but I feel zombie film aficionados understand the difference.
B001TZQITM|5.0|The case is very well constructed and clearly designed for a small digital camcorder.  The camcorder must be roughly the size of a 12 oz. soda can.

The name is misleading in that only smaller digital camears (not SLR) will fit in the case.  A flip camera and a small digital camera would fit nice along with the support cables, batteries, etc.

B00012BD0S|3.0|This is an earlier effort from Symphony X, and it does show some great qualities.  For a band that at the time was younger, they do a nice job with the overall production, and the song arrangements are smartly laid out.  Romero's guitar work is predictably solid, as is the rest of the band.  Allen moves his vocals between sweet & clean to powerful & gritty effectively.  Still, I can see that they have made much progress since.  For one thing, their production values have increased immensely.  Divine Wings of Tragedy doesn't have the same crisp, full mix that later efforts such as Paradise Lost have.  And while most of the vocal arrangements are excellent here, at times I didn't fully \\"get\\" the harmonies they were going for in the sense that they didn't always sound like the best complimentary choice to me.  The epic title track, however, is an excellent piece of prog, clocking in at just over 20 minutes and providing just about everything across the spectrum that a fan of this style of music could want.
0805091742|5.0|I found \\"The Checklist Manifesto...\\" to be an exposition of an outstandingly simple concept, which brought home how the daily and sometimes routine fallibilities of humans can be accentuated to our collective detriment, yet easily overcome by a very profound but simple concept of the checklist, and how those simple tools, checklists, can be adapted to all professions for promoting and promulgating failsafe environments.      If we first understand that easily avoidable mistakes that can have major consequences can be alleviated in routine practice through the checklist system, we cannot only save time, money, and inconvenience, we can also save lives and avert needless tragedy.  There has been nothing that has evolved in recent times within our highly specialized society that has had a more significant or positive impact on our lives than the simplicity of the adaptation and utilization of checklists in modern medical practice.      I found Checklists to be informative, instructional, and purposeful, and will use the concept in my everyday practice of building resiliency into modern business processes to save time, money, and avert catastrophe by avoiding human error through the utilization of checklists.

The 30th anniversary edition doesn't really improve on the sound quality of the original vinyl or other CD versions but well worth having a fresh copy.
015626224X|5.0|Down and Out in Paris and London by George Orwell is an incredible story about poverty. Orwell describes the experiences of being out of work, then of working as a plongeur (a dish washer - one of the lowest jobs imaginable) in Paris, and of becoming a tramp in London. Orwell writes beautifully with humour and describes each of the experiences with great details while maintaining the reader's interest. This novel is about poverty, but if you are looking for a story with a proper plot, then this in not the book for you.     The novel is written in first person, yet the protagonist is never named. This story is thought to include many events from Orwell's life. Orwell's stories are magnificent and are those that I always recall because they can be related to the real world.       The protagonist is an Englishman whose money is one day stolen, and as an English teacher, he is left without work because he no longer has any students. The little money he has left is getting spent too quickly, and each day he has less and less. He contacts the only man he seems to know in Paris, and finds that he is, unfortunately, in the same situation - almost penniless and without work. Work is terribly difficult to find. The lodging houses are uncomfortable to sleep in for the night. How does the Englishman deal with poverty?       It is a sad tale that makes you feel grateful that you have a roof above your head; are not forced to eat bread, margarine, and tea as your only meals; and never have to starve yourself for days at a time if you are ever left penniless. It is shocking to see how far vagabonds traveled just for free tea or food.     May contain spoilers:    I believe one of the main points of this work was to emphasise that poverty is a cycle that likely will not come to an end unless the government steps in and does something productive with the tramps. The last paragraph states all that the protagonist learned throughout the tale: \\"I shall never again think that all trampsare drunken scoundrels, nor expect a beggar to be grateful when I give him a penny, nor be surprised if men out of work lack energy, nor subscribe to the Salvation Army, nor pawn my clothes, nor refuse a handbill, nor enjoy a meal at a smart restaurant.\\" (213) Even after his tale, the protagonist concludes that he feels he has merely seen the fringes of poverty.      NOTES ON THIS EDITION    I would NOT recommend this edition. Everything seems to have a dash censoring it, even though those words are very important to the story. I had to purchase another edition just two weeks after, and now I have two.
B0036EBARO|4.0|When Goldfrapp release a new album, you never know what you will find in the box.  Is it the dreamy, quirky Goldfrapp of Felt Mountain? The glam of Supernature? Or even the folky, acoustic feel of their most recent record, Seventh Tree?  \\"Head First\\", Goldfrapp's fifth album, sees the virtuosic British duo (that electro-pop siren Alison Goldfrapp and her wizard sidekick Will Gregory) embrace 80s blockbusters (Top Gun, Flashdance), and euphoric synth-bombast (Abba, ELO, The Pointer Sisters), to buoyant - if not mindblowing - effect.  Will and Alison once again reinvent themselves, and head back towards the disco.  The CD comprises nine brisk tracks and clocks in at under 40 minutes, so there's hardly a wasted second.  There is not a sigle dud, all songs snappily titled, five with just single words.  This is upbeat, unashamedly pop album.  There's \\"Rocket\\" with its witty guide to how to end a relationship (\\"I've gotta rocket/You're going on it/You're never coming back\\"). \\"I Wanna Life\\", which quotes Johnny Mathis and Deniece Williams, is unashamedly camp and sounds like the early '80s hit \\"Gloria\\" by Laura Brannigan and the frankly implausible notion of Goldfrapp finding herself too tubby for her jeans on \\"Alive\\".  The beautiful \\"Believer\\", with its stadium-sized chorus,reminds of Fleetwood Mac.  \\"Voicething\\" tones down the disco and is floaty and atmospheric while \\"Hunt\\" is dark and dramatic.  Apart from the dance pulse, there is a subtler side to Goldfrapp, and happily that is also here, as a title like \\"Dreaming\\" might lead you to suspect.  There's not much room for the experimental Goldfrapp of old here, although the abstract album closer \\"Voicething'  with its sampled, cut up vocals and no actual lyrics could almost have found a home on \\"Felt Mountain\\".  \\"The breathy technology of Voicething is more captivating than a Laurie Anderson tribute but something of a musical non-sequitur\\".- Colin Somerville.   All in all, the album is first and foremost about all-out electropop, all done in the best possible taste.  No duds here, but not a truly killer song either.  Amazing.

B000VR824S|2.0|I was at the first event and by comparison to this show I have to say that its not better the second time around. I think that the only thing this show has over the first is Beck and W Nelson . THe whole atmosphere seems very commercial and more of a concert promotion rather than a festival to celebrate the blues and other forms of music with the spotlight on guitar work. I own this dvd and rarely watch it. The vibe on the first festival is better,more like being at Woodstock since it was a whole weekend event and the cotton bowl was packed with about 65000 friendly people.
B001MW0J2O|1.0|This is a sad attempt at a musical joke. This was never meant to be taken seriously. No sane musicians could absolutely be this inept and soundfully tone deaf. Complete incompetence. This sounds like a child's attempt to make music. These people must have been drunk when they recorded this garbage. Animals. Yes, a gorilla in a zoo cage could make more sonically coherent music than this pathetic magnum opus of misery to my ears.
B002VPE1B6|1.0|I loved Avatar so much that I went to see it 3 times at the theater, but I am hesitant to purchase this bare-bones Blu-ray due to the price.  Usually when a movie is a huge blockbuster, the studio can afford to sell the DVD/Blu-ray for less due to the fact that they don't need to recoup the production and advertising money back.  So my question is why is the price of this Blu-ray so much?!  Especially considering that before Christmas you could get District 9, Inglourious Basterds, and Harry Potter all for under $18 each, with special features, and a digital copy. It seems like the studio is being way too greedy for selling this Disc for $25.00 knowing that they are going to release at least 2 more versions of this movie in the next year.  I would have loved to see Fox set the new standard for Blu-ray pricing by releasing this movie for around $14.99. But instead they decided to \\"low blow\\" us like this?   : (

B0012GMZDG|5.0|What can you say about the most versatile guitarist on the planet? It seems that everything he sinks himself into he commands, rock, blues, techno, rockabilly, jazz, it makes no difference. Guitar players will be honing thier chops with this one as well. Wanted to get this CD for some time and glad I finally did.
0529064847|5.0|This is IMO the best edition of the NAB for under $10. If you  are inclined to read your Bible while having your lunch or where theres kids playing, then you will not want to use an expensive leather bound edition costing $$ - I've learned this by experence!    For such a cheap price, this paperback stands upto a lot of use, I've had one for 17 years of regular use, ( you should cover it with plastic adhesive book covering).    So overall full 5 stars, highly recommended.

0307271862|5.0|I was introduced to Henning Mankell's books a few years ago while visiting a friend in Sweden.  I've read through all of the Wallander series and a few of Mankell's other books (Kennedy's Brain, etc) so I was happy to see another one recently translated and released in the US.<br /><br />This books takes place both in Sweden and China.  It's a little bit of a mystery/crime and a little bit of friendship/self-discovery.  Very entertaining and a lot less awkward in the translation than previous works.  The storyline is compelling and interesting, the main character is someone I wasn't sure I like until I was well into the book.  The only weird thing for me is the main character happens to be a judge and it's a little difficult for me to understand the Swedish judicial system and how free they are with giving personal information (such as a judge's home address).  I don't know if that's true, or just written that way, but it's bizarre.<br /><br />If you're a fan of Scandinavian thrillers, Henning Mankell, you'll enjoy this book.  If you're not, give it a try, I'm certain you'll become hooked!
0312360258|1.0|This wasn't one of the worst books I have ever read, but it still was one the dumbest books I have ever read. The characters are superficial and cliched, the plot predictable and silly, and the narration is whiny and irritating. The main character and her friends are sterotypes. The writing is very childish and reads like a wet dream.
B001DCQIAU|3.0|Hi Karajan fans. Needless to say the performances here are magnificent. But if you're a fan of this conductor do yourself a big favor and purchase each composers edition separately. The individual boxes are beautifully done and much classier than this box. Yeah, it'll cost more, but they are so much nicer it's worth it. The conductor that made DGG deserves it.
0393072231|1.0|I really like Michael Lewis. The New New Thing is one of my favorite books. But the Big Short is not being made available in the format that I like to read books. In my opinion this is an inferior product. It's a bit like a record label only selling an album on casette tape.
0470477237|5.0|The book does an exceptional job of outlining what has changed and what is going to change in marketing. Socialnomics is full of relevant stats to make any marketing exec pay attention and apply the changes to their business.
B0036EBARO|4.0|This band has never ceased to amaze me.  They've gone from sultry trip-hop to stark glam-rock to acoustic bliss to...Head First.  This album definitely has a retro feel to it, as suggested by the neat cover art (especially that of the single for \\"Rocket\\").  Unlike their last outing, The Seventh Tree, Goldfrapp have returned to a more upbeat style.  While this is nothing like Black Cherry/Supernature, this still has all the delicious synthpop goodness that you've come to love about Goldfrapp.  Songs like \\"Rocket\\", \\"Alive\\" and \\"Dreaming\\" have such a great 70's feel to them.  But the really stand-out track here is \\"I Wanna Life\\", which is an anthemic showstopper that closes out the album proper.  The final track, \\"Voicething\\", is a semi-instrumental song that is somewhat reminiscent of Imogen Heap.    My only complaint about Head First is the length.  At only nine songs, it ends way too soon.  But still, it's a short and sweet album that truly can't be missed!

0312117337|5.0|I cannot think of enough words to describe how great this deck is. I was skeptical at first, based on decks I've had in the past. The book doesn't have the vague answers that most contain- it is very aptly zen. The artwork is breathtakingly beautiful. It's actually caused me pause on readings because I would get so focused on the art (and the story it holds). The readings themselves are like a form of meditation. Definitely the best of all tarot decks I've used, this is my go-to deck.
0786856297|4.0|This series was recommended by my pastor!  So, of course, I had to read them.  Book 1 was very entertaining and I recommended to my 10 y/o and 8 7/o grandsons.  Older was already on Book 4 and younger started immediately.  We had to see the movie over spring break and all thought the book was better.  Enjoy the god relationships.

B002ZTQVBQ|5.0|To anyone who was disappointed by this movie...  You have no soul.      Let me start by saying that my first and favorite Miyazaki movie was \\"Spirited Away\\".  But as much as I, the ultimate anime/animation lover, can say that...  It was long and somewhat plodding at times.  Yes I know the tone of the movie and the characters dictated this to some degree, but still...      Ponyo on the otherhand is a more stunningly realized and tighter movie with innocence to spare.  My partner and I just watched in amazement at the colors, the music, the themes, the hidden little messages, nuances... Sigh... :)  It's childhood and adulthood realized in one wonderful work of art.      If you have children or still feel like a child at heart, buy this, in blu ray for the love of!  , immediately.  You simply won't be disappointed.
B001M5UDGS|5.0|My friend told me about this fantastic movie.    People who previously posted have been complaining about everything from length to dialog to singing, but most obviously the DVD production. Let's clear a couple things up.    1- don't believe what you read. I bought this exact product from Amazon.com and it is NOT a DVD-R anymore. It is the real thing.    2- This was originally written and created during the writer's strike that brought about completely awful movies (ex. Juno), and so, yes, the script is not written in the same way as your average blockbuster, Titanic, way.    3- All the actors in this movie did it on a volunteer basis.    Despite these, as some would call them, setbacks. This movie is a sparkling gem of movie excellence. It is wacky and corny, resulting in one of the most excellent pieces of movie genius created. 42 minutes or so of comic genius, the movie centers around Neil Patrick Harris as Dr. Horrible, a 20-something scientist with a deep crush on a girl in a laundromat, and the burning feeling that something is inherently wrong with \\"the system\\" and that HE needs to be the one to fix it. (oh, and a need to be accepted by the \\"Evil League of Evil\\") Nathan Fillion stars as the dimwitted rival/ superhero to Dr. Horrible's scheming.    Basically, yes, it has your generic \\"scientist, who blogs constantly about his works\\" plot-line, and the songs have wonderfully corny lyrics. However, the quality of the acting from the performers balances out whatever someone may have against cheesy lyrics in a \\"made-to-be-cheesy\\" film.    Bad Horse recommends buying this film.
B0030Y11XS|3.0|Although I like Michael Moore's attempt to expose the corruption in America, he follows a very naive assumption that someone like Obama has some answers to the corporate wellfare state, healthcare problems, exportation of industry and jobs, and bankster's control of the federal government.  Obama, aka: Barry Soetoro, someone very familar with the Constitution has never even provided acceptable proof of US citizenship, such a certified copy of his birth certificate with doctor's signature like every other person has to provide. There is good reason to believe that he was not even legally eligible to be a US Senator, much less the US President.  How much help will he be when/if proved to be a complete fraud and puppet?    I urge Michael Moore to get away from the old left/right paradigm and look at the facts regardless of political party.  We need people in office who still defend the US Constitution and will work to comply with it, not abuse it over and over again.      If you have watched HBO's \\"ROME\\", you can see what the USA is becoming with tyrants cloaking their actions in the name of the \\"republic\\" with all sorts of political games, propaganda, martial law, wars, circuses, parades, and murder. Some playing to the \\"noblemen\\" and others to the common \\"plebs\\" in order to maintain their power. It is looking far too familar.    Like many other activists today, Mr. Moore seems to have no real practical solutions after exposing some true criminals.  I do like his attempt at the citizen's arrest even though it shows how futile the idea has become in a nation where the Constitution is regarded only as a relic.

B00005JMEW|3.0|I can't really adore this film. I really can't. A lot of people love this film (my friends and my older brother really enjoy it), but I don't see this as a great film. I mean, it's great that other people like it; I respect other people's opinions. But for me, this film is not special to me in many ways. First of all, Tarantino's over-the-top style really turns me off. I do like Pulp Fiction and Reservoir Dogs, but Kill Bill Vol. 1 is something that I dislike because of its awkward cinematography, and because of its annoying and unnecessary music. I don't mind style-over-substance, but this is really pushing it beyond the boundaries. Every scene just has to be overly stylish: 70's and 80's pop music is used, the photography is overstuffed with Avant-garde material, some scenes aren't even relevant to the story at all, and the overall tone of the film is all over the place. I mean, is this supposed to be a thiller, a satire, a black comedy? Since this is directed by Tarantino, who knows?<br /><br />I will say this, however. The performances, dialogue, and fight scenes are really superb. Tarantino knows how to create clever dialogue, and it shows not only in Pulp Fiction & Reservoir Dogs, but in here as well. Thurman, Liu, Carradine (R.I.P.), and Fox really deliver with their impressive acting. The fight scenes, while overdone and overly awkward at times, are still a sight to see. And of course, the violence is perfect, and it should surely piss off every PC freak on the planet if they ever see this film (and I'm sure they already have). But on the downside, I don't think the good things about the film are enough to save Kill Bill from the bad things about it. The excessive style really turns me off from the film, and I can't really enjoy this movie after repeated viewings. It's good that other people like it, though.<br /><br />Grade: C-
B000NTPDSW|5.0|Be prepared to waste 2+ days watching these movies, its really hard to stop watching them once you start.  A classic that you should really watch if you have not done so already.

B002LVVCQM|2.0|I'm a big fan of Prof. Dawkins. His books are always beautifully written,  clear and persuasive. This one is no exception. But unfortunately I bought it on my Kindle. I didn't realize how bad this Kindle version is until I happened to come across a printed one in a Tokyo bookstore. I was dumbfounded at the illustrations of  dazzling colors and superb quality. It's a shame that I bought a Kindle version without those wonderful pictures.  It's absolutely a great loss for such a great book and a serious disadvantage for Amazon's Kindle device. With Apple's iPad forthcoming, Amazon has to do more to remain relevant in this market, and do it quickly.

1416562605|3.0|I didn't love the story.  Actually, I think I liked the story, but didn't necessarily like the novel if that makes sense.  It lacked whatever it is that classifies a book as \\"great\\" in my mind.<br /><br />It's the story of Balram Halwi.  He is telling his story (which is one thing that always makes an audiobook translation work well for me) in the form of a letter to a dignitary who will be visiting India.  He wants him to know the story of the real India -- his India.  Because of this, I'm glad that I read it for the purposes of the challenge, because it did a great job of portraying the current poverty, class struggle, and obstacles and opportunities presented to Indians today.<br /><br />It's described as being \\"darkly comic,\\" and I agree with that.<br /><br />So in summary, I liked the story and the way the information was presented, but as a \\"great novel\\" it fell short.
B002VPE1AW|3.0|I'm not knocking this movie.  I loved the movie and would have given the DVD a better rating, but....<br /><br />If you just want to see the movie, sure get this to satisfy your curiosity. Keep in mind this ISN'T the 3D version.  There are NO extras.<br /><br />I saw this in the theater in 3D and must tell you, I can't imagine seeing it any other way.  This movie was meant to be experienced in 3D and thank goodness home technology is making that possible.  It's a completely different experience and one well worth waiting for. A great movie best seen in all it's glory (hence the three stars for the stripped down version).
B0027BOL4G|5.0|You'll never look at a hamburger (or any other meat or chicken or food product) the same way again!      I have long been a fan of a no-red-meat, organic food, and locally grown products, but now I am a Believer, with a capital B big time.      Furthermore, there is a scene in this film that epitomizes the nature of command and control in organizations, which is instructive to anyone who is a student of systems and how they ultimately and predictably break down.  The same beef processor depicted at this moment in the film had to recall thousands of tons of beef product a week or so after I watched to movie due to exactly the sort of e-coli problems the film was showing viewers they were bound to have.      Finally, there is a farmer from Virginia in this film who ought to be made head of US Department of Agriculture.  There are a number of real heroes in this movie and the movie itself constitutes an act of courage in the face of monopoly capital.
0394716787|5.0|Edgar A. Poe -- he never used Allan -- yet we do, is one of a<br />America's greatest writers. Time has only added to his reputation.<br /><br />This volume collects most but not all of his tales and most of his poems as well. Congrats to those who collaborated with the editor who offers us this cornucopia. Some entries are apparently published here for the first time.<br /><br />The editor's carefully written essay is revealing and helps prepare us for the feast ahead. But then we are left alone to discover Poe for ourselves. We are not spoonfed with endless commentary. Thus this volume is a great contribution on many levels.<br /><br />Poe has influenced writers in many countries with his dark but always gripping stories and his lyrical poems. Argentine Jorge Borges paid him hommage many a time. I am sure Stephen King has as well.<br /><br />All the great stories that scared us as youngsters are here: The Tell-Tale Heart, The Pit And the Pendulum, The Cask of Amantillado, The Murders in the Rue Morgue, and on and on. It is a joy to read them as a adult. After all we already know the ending and thus are not as terrified and can enjoy the story as it unravels.  These tales also provide us an insight to life that perhaps we did not appreciate or comprehend as children.<br /><br />So although I commend this volume to those who read Poe before, for you will enjoy the content even more than before. I hope a whole new  generation of youngsters and those not so young will be introduced to this American Master.
B002PQ7JQK|5.0|I am amazed at how great a picture they were able to pull from a 40 year old show.  The blu-ray delivers excellent quality picture and sound.  The new special effects help make the show feel a little more current.  Although I am a huge fan, I am happy that they decided to revamp the effects.  The bonus features are also enjoyable.  This is a worthy addition to any sci fi fan's collection.  Buy it!

B0036EBARO|2.0|I'm a big Goldfrapp fan, but I found this album very disappointing. First of all, it's so short! Secondly, it's a very poppy predictable album with little creativity. I don't mind an 80's influenced sound if it's done with some cleverness. They seem to have abandoned any sense of being an edgy group and turned into Kylie Minogue. Alison does continue to havea great voice so that's the best thing I can say about this record.

If Peter Gabriel were a lesser talent, I would have never endured Scratch My Back all the way through until I lost count at approximately twenty times or so. For the life of me it is impossible to see the point of transforming and reinterpreting a uniformly brilliant sampling of Gabriel's favorite artists into well over an hour of somnolent mush.     It could be that I'm out of synch with the \\"artiste\\" and I just don't get it - but with the exception of Paul Simon's Boy in the Bubble every song involved could be syndicated for elevator duty or run on endless loop during an 800-number customer-service interstitial.

B001AQO3WY|4.0|First off, I haven't been deployed to Iraq, nor a I a Marine. That being said, I found the series to be very entertaining. Granted, it may or may not be a totally accurate depiction of the attitude of the Marines themselves (there are some sequences that don't strike me as...\\"characteristic\\", for lack of a better word, of Marines, or members of any branch for that matter.) That aside, Generation Kill strikes me as being a relatively well done series just a few notches down from Band of Brothers.

1591843162|5.0|Attracted by the title and blurbs I leafed through the book and found an immediate connection with the author's ideas. Intrigued I bought the book (my first business / self-help title in over ten years) and was delighted to see a model that fit so well with my own and many colleagues' experiences over a long career. He explains that the key to building a meaningful career is to (1) focus on art or work that one is passionate about and (2) spend time connecting people & ideas to challenges that organizations care about. Sounds simple but he also makes a strong case that this is the only way to build security in our professional lives since anything else can be replicated more cheaply by someone else :)
B000OT8GCQ|4.0|Anyone who knows or loves someone with autism or aspbergers will love this book for its tender portrayal of a fully functional but emotionally removed adult father with aspergers.  It will make anyone who knows someone that is a bit \\"odd\\" look at him a little less judgementally, wondering if they are maneuvering the world the best they can.  The other story in the book - the love story - is less compelling and more typical sparks - starcrossed lovers - but it is Sparks at his best.  It is a quick easy read, great for the beach or summer vacation.
1906694176|5.0|The Girl Who Kicked the Hornets' Nest is a fine conclusion to the Millenium Trilogy, tying up the loose ends that have carried over for three novels and kept viewers around the world panting for the next installment.  Though the novel is complex, it is the best and most intriguing of the three-and highly rewarding since it builds on all the action that has gone before, further developing the characters we have come to love.  Lisbeth Salander, the focus of all three novels, is hospitalized and kept in isolation for virtually the entire six hundred pages here, but she is a looming presence throughout, and when it becomes clear that she will have to face trial for some of the murders in The Girl Who Played With Fire, Mikael Blomqvist, a mentor and friend, finds a way to unleash her formidable, secret skills as a hacker.<br /><br />Lisbeth feels isolated, unable to trust, and she refuses to have any contact with Blomqvist, the investigative journalist and founder of Millenium Magazine with whom she once worked as a computer expert.  He is still fond of her and still keeps all her secrets, even from his sister, Annika Giannini, the advocate who will be defending her against murder charges.  She has serious problems with anger as a result of her confinement to a mental institution from the age of twelve to fourteen due to the evaluation of famed psychiatrist Dr. Peter Treborian, who is actively working to have her recommitted.  Her father, Alexander Zalachenko, aka Karl Alex Bodin, a Russian defector during the Cold War and a vicious sadist, is recovering from wounds just two rooms down from Lisbeth at Sahlgrenska Hospital.<br /><br />As Blomqvist investigates the circumstances surrounding the crimes in which Lisbeth has been involved, he is absolutely certain that she should never have been committed.  Why, he wonders, do they care so much about her, and why was it so important that she be committed to a secure psychiatric facility at the age of twelve?  Others are also investigating these crimes-and Lisbeth herself:  the Goteborg Police, who found Lisbeth and Zalachenko near death at the end of the previous novel; the Stockholm Police, who are investigating other crimes involving both Lisbeth and Zalachenko;  Richard Ekstrom, a prosecutor who has declared Salander to be \\"a vicious psychopath\\";  the Swedish Security Police (Sapo), for whom Zalachenko once worked; and the \\"Section for Special Analysis,\\" a tiny group spun off from Sapo which is virtually unknown except to its own few members.<br /><br />Larsson spends the first two hundred pages setting the scene and revisiting the action of the previous two books.  The action is vivid and detailed, and as the makeup of the Section for Special Analysis unfolds, and glimpses of governments, past and present, emerge, the reader discovers that people once thought to be part of one group are also part of another.  Intrigue in the private lives of the characters and within Millenium Magazine, Svenska Morgon Posten, (Sweden's largest daily newspaper), Milton Security, the legal system, the police, and the government's security organizations, keeps the reader constantly challenged to keep track of the details which make this novel so satisfying.  The final resolution is a bittersweet experience-hugely rewarding because the important issues are resolved, but immensely sad because there will be no more books in the series.  A grand finale to a terrific series.

142313494X|5.0|The Percy Jackson series got my kids as excited about reading as the Harry Potter series did.  My 9, 11, and 15 year olds (boys and girls) as well as my husband became addicted to this series and now have it in common to discuss and share.  My 9 year old boy had never read a book this long and wasn't a particularly good reader but he was able to read without help and fully understood the plot.  My 15 year old has been learning Greek Myythology in school and now has a better understanding of the gods and demigods and their traits. Riordan is a masterful writer to bring our family together in one series.  I own very few books but bought the entire series as I know it will be reread over and over again.
B002RSDW80|5.0|This is a wonderful story, and a wonderful movie. Meryl Streep was, of course, impressive as Julia Child. I've watched several of Julia Child's videos, and Streep is so like Julia. What I don't understand is why people didn't appreciate Amy Adam's acting, or her story. Adams acting really brings Streep's into focus, as well as having a compelling part in the story. It's great to watch Streep as Julia, but we couldn't watch her without Julie. Julie used food to help her through life, and how few of us recognize a way to help ourselves through tough times, and how few others actually carry it out?  This is an fantastic movie, and it is not only about the story and acting, it makes you want to cook... at least, it made me want to cook!
B000JQU1VS|4.0|A great freebie to keep on the kindle for when you've overspent your budget and still want something to read.  You don't have to read the full book - each short mystery is self contained but you learn more about the characters as you read more of the stories.  Especially enjoyable if you have recently seen the blockbuster movie.  You will be surprised how much of the movie details are in the stories.
B002ZG97RE|5.0|In \\"The Green Zone\\" Matt Damon is quite a rebel, on a one-man crusade to change American foreign policy in Iraq. He's an army chief warrant officer assigned to find Weapons of Mass Destruction (WMD) caches, but he soon realizes the intell he's been given is bogus stuff so he takes it upon himself to veer off course and get involved in stuff not part of his mandate. It's action-packed, and it gives the feeling of what Iraq was like in the early days. It's very authentic looking and compliments \\"The Hurt Locker\\" which deals with a much smaller aspect of the war and gets into the head of one monomaniacal soldier. This is more external stuff.<br /> Damon's character is a pretty shrewd guy and seems to be operating way above his pay grade. The movie has a single-minded focus on conspiracies and doesn't bother with love interest.<br /> I found it quite absorbing and interesting because of the wider political aspects it covered. There's no time in the movie to do any deep probing of character psychology, but it proves once again that the ordinary American citizen is not only brainy but quite able to take on the establishment, quite unusual for a member of the armed forces, but part of the great American tradition of the independence and courage, one might even say recklessness, of the average Joe.<br /> The movie has a well-constructed plot. Damon meets up with an informer who's willing to give him inside dope, but of course he's fighting a battle with a defense department civilian (Greg Kinnear) who has an agenda to adhere to. The CIA guy, a very bulky Brendan Gleeson, is the good guy, and is working with Damon.<br /> It's an interesting movie, fast-paced, and with serious implications. You see the suffering of the Iraqis and the way the Green Zone in Baghdad is isolated and insulated from the country's people.<br /> It's one of the newer genres of American films in which the good guys and the bad guys are both Americans fighting turf battles.
1423101472|4.0|I am the exception to my family in not thinking this is the best in the Percy Jackson series. I found myself less eager to read through; I kept falling asleep. The characters weren't developed much further from book 4 except Luke and the majority of the book seemed to be overdone battle scenes, which may be why the 9 year old boy loved htem.  I did like the way Percy learned more about Luke's life in little pieces and the ending was excellent. Overall, it was true to the series and I recommend it to those who loved the other 4, but I was slightly disappointed. I still think Riordan is a genius.  He got my son to read this long complex book and comprehend it, pushing him so far past any other reading level he has done.
1932100660|5.0|Dr. Campbell presents and explains his and other's research with such ease and clear understanding, helping  the reader understand this significant research.  It made me look at my health and diet and helped me make healthy changes, I hope for life!   I truly can't stop sharing this book with others. I only hope people will read it and that it makes an impact in there lives as much as it has in mine.    Thanks for taking the time to do this research and write this book Dr. Campbell, you have awakened my thinking on healthy nutriton and its impact on chronic health conditions and the prevention of them!

B000JMKNV0|4.0|The brain is considered the last frontier - the unknown, unchartered territory of medical science.  Dennis Lehane's detailed portrayal of an assylum for the mentally ill, its patients and caretakers helps the reader to understand all that we cannot yet comprehend about the mind.  The fragility of the mind and the desperation of those in danger of losing their minds is what makes this book scary.  Movie commercials for the tie-in to this book left me thinking it would be a horror, reminiscent of Stephen King, but the book is very far from that.  It is much more thoughtful, a who-dunit mystery with a psychological twist and deep character development.  It kept me up at night because I wanted to continue reading, not because of the content.
B001W03UWM|4.0|The Bruder loader backhoe is a very good toy.  My 3 year old son really enjoys playing with it.  It has fine detail and looks very realistic.  The size is just right for him to carry it around.  He can even play with it in his car seat.  It is high quality but could break after time and usage since it is plastic.  My boy uses it as an \\"indoor toy\\" and it has held up very well.
B002HREKCI|5.0|This powerful book on teen suicide will stay in your mind forever.  It deals with some difficult that teens face including dating, reputations, drinking, drug use and sex.  It is important to be aware that these topics are discussed if recommending to a student or child that may not be mature enough for the topics. However, I recommend that all students entering high school and their parents read this book.  The reader will be left with a deep understanding of the effects both of your actions and inactions.  An encounter that may seem inconsequential to one person may have a major effect on someone due to the cumulative effect. Nothing we do is in isolation and we are all responsible for our actions.  Just as the characters in this book don't want to listen to the tapes that are left behind detailing the reasons for a teenager's suicide, but are compelled to keep listening, so too are we compelled to read on to find the difficult truth that could cause a youngster to end her life.
B001RTCP1A|5.0|No need for a plot overview: If you're reading the reviews, you have probably already seen the movie that launched Vin Diesel's career.  This was the very first Blu-Ray movie that I purchased from Amazon after getting a player last year, and watching it in High-Definition was simply amazing.<br /><br />I had already seen Pitch Black on DVD, and based on the sounds and visuals, I figured that Blu-Ray would bring the movie to life.  I'm glad to say that I wasn't the least bit disappointed.  The colors look amazing, the audio is great, and the level of detail was just unreal.  I did read a few comments from other reviewers about the Blu-Ray freezing up on them, but fortunately that has never happened to me.  I've since purchased countless Blu-Ray movies, but Pitch Black is easily one of my favorites to watch in HDTV.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|This is a book about dogs and racing to which the reader needs not bring a love of either.  In actuality, it is a book about a man's frustrations with his career, his dreams and his wife told through the eyes of his ever faithful dog.  The dog's unadultered love for his master colors his narration of the major events of his life, but the brilliant writing of Garth Stein permits us to see his humanity and therefore his imperfections.
B000NQPZCO|5.0|The mob movie is one of the staples of American cinema and hundreds of them have been made. Donnie Brasco,a true story of an undercover agent released in 1997 by British director Mike Newell (Four Weddings and a Funeral) is one of the best. Francis Ford Coppola's Godfather Trilogy ranks first, followed by Martin Scorsese's Goodfellas. I would put this one, starring Al Pacino and Johnny Depp, in third place.<br />Don't miss the excellent documentary included in the blu-ray edition.
B001HNE3NO|5.0|An extremely emotional and believable novel.  Have you ever read a fiction book and wondered if it was true.  It was so well written that I couldn't believe it wasn't but prayed and prayed it wasn't.  The structure of the book is magnificent as we learn the story of Sarah's key along with the narrator.  She becomes obsessed with finding out the story and as she unearthes the truth so do we.  Beautifully written!

B000JQUMPI|5.0|This classic tale of four sisters growing up in a transcendental Massachusetts home during the Civil War is sure to remain relevant to generations of young women.  The story is about relationships and self awareness and the importance of family values and moral certitude and less about the time or setting.  The language remains easily readable, even to for today's generation of slang.

B002TYZKIM|5.0|I was a fan of Michael Jackson from the time he sang with his brothers.  I watched his career all my life.  \\"This is it\\" shows how brilliant Michael was and what a performer he was.  It amazed me to watch how much energy he put into each performance even though it was just \\"dress rehearsal\\".  His voice is not as strong as it was in years past but I feel that the reason was that this was just a rehearsal.  You can see what a perfectionist he was because he wanted to make sure every note and step showed what he wanted the audience to see.  I loved watching Michael doing what he did best--performing.    The reason I hated it is the fact that we will never see him do this again.  What a loss to the entertainment industry. Have tissues handy when watching the DVD because the realization comes to you that this really is it for Michael Jackson.
B0000X61UU|5.0|It is a little embarrassing to still do this video because it is so old, but it is that good. I first did this in high school and I still pull it out every now and then because it is such a good workout.  I workout pretty regularly, but this workout always makes me sore, especially in my arms and chest.  (This is one of the best chest exercises I have found.) My regular workout video is 30-day shred, but this is great for my 4th or extra workout.
B000TGJ8AS|5.0|Excellent season, with high quality with their actors, unfortunally the audio languages changes to spanish and English, to only English, breaking they way was coming in the 3erd prior seasons.
B001TH8UUA|5.0|My item arrived in no time from Amazon. I hooked this product up to my PS3 without hesitation. There has been no problems thus far from this product. I am a strong believer of giving things a try. I can say that this product gets a good review from me. I was looking at other high end HDMI cables and I choose to save a little money to purchase this one. I prefer to purchase things online that way I don't have to get persuaded into buying expensive things that I do not need from Best Buy or Wal Mart. I enjoy doing my own research and going by reviews. Sometimes those two things are important while doing online shopping.
B000H45SDS|5.0|It's been a long time since I stayed up all night reading a book...  This one did that - very moving.

B002VPE1B6|3.0|I have absolutely fallen in love with this movie in all aspects...but... I agree with most of the other 1-star reviewers. Fox is really pi$$ing us off with this multi-release crap. First of all, I also have to comment on all of the \\"no 3D, no buy\\" reviews. Given that the technology for actually utilizing the 3D effects in home theaters is so new and still big $$$, I don't think I can take the multitudes of self-proclaimed 3D elitists seriously. So, I take them with less than a grain of salt.<br />But that said, I originally placed a pre-order for this Blu-ray/DVD set but later cancelled it in favor of renting, then buying the \\"special edition\\" with the extras. I think it is worth the wait.  I have 2 home theaters in my home. Both HDTV, Both 5:1 audio. Only one with Blu-ray so having the combo-set would be good. But I want the extras. (But, I don't care about the 3D).
B002W2AD60|5.0|This is the Scorpions album that most people forget about - just after the rocking [[ASIN:B0000073NK Virgin Killer]], and just before their first live album, [[ASIN:B00006WKSZ Tokyo Tapes]]. This is the last studio album with guitarist Ulrich Roth, and the first with drummer Herman Rarebell. A very good transition album from the Scorpions of the 70's to the group of the 80's.<br /><br />It starts off hard with \\"Steamrock Fever\\", a bouncy and rocking song you'll want to listen to over and over. Following that is \\"We'll Burn the Sky\\", with lyrics about death and meeting up again... this is a good song, but it sounds even better on Tokyo Tapes. After that is \\"I've Got To Be Free\\", one of Roth's last songs for the group, and yet another rocker, and then \\"The Riot of Your Life\\" with its oddly prophetic lyrics.<br /><br />Side 2 (or the fifth song on the album) is \\"The Sails of Charon\\", a magnificent piece of guitar work throughout, and a great song to listen to - the only unfortunate thing being that the only place you'll find the original full length version (5:16) of the song is on vinyl... the CDs have the shorter (4:23) version of the song. You really need to hear the full thing to get the full impact of it, but it's still very good even in its shorter version. After that is the softer \\"Your Light\\", Roth's other contribution to the song writing on the album.<br /><br />Next up is easily the hardest rocking song on the album, and one of the weirdest, \\"He's A Woman, She's A Man\\" - just listen to the lyrics to get your mind blown. This one will really remind you of their later works, albums such as [[ASIN:B000001EUP Blackout]] and [[ASIN:B000001EUR Love at First Sting]] - not really surprising, as Herman Rarebell co-wrote it along with Schenker and Meine. This song will blow your speakers out, no problem.<br /><br />The last song on the (regular) album is \\"Born to Touch Your Feelings\\", a mellow one from Schenker & Meine, quite good. If you get the reissued CD with the bonus tracks, you'll also have \\"Suspender Love\\" on the album (the only other place you'll find that is on Tokyo Tapes, unfortunately), which is good and bouncy. The final cut (bonus) is a live version of \\"Polar Nights\\", with some great guitar work.<br /><br />This is a great album to get if your a Scorpions fan - it's got a bit of everything, and is an excellent bridge between the two 'generations' of Scorpions. \\"He's A Woman, She's A Man\\", \\"Steamrock Fever\\", \\"We'll Burn the Sky\\" and \\"The Sails of Charon\\" are all excellent, songs you'll play again and again and again... and the rest of the album is very much worth it as well. Don't miss this album.uspender Love\\" on the album (the only other place you'll find that is on Tokyo Tapes, unfortunately), which is good and bouncy.

B000001EUL|5.0|Even though this album came out in 1979, it is considered the first of the classic 80's lineup for the group. Guitarist Ulrich Roth was gone, replaced temporarily by Matthias Jabs. Founding member (and brother of guitarist Rudolf Schenker) Michael Schenker ([[ASIN:B0018YIW48 UFO]]) rejoined the group for a while, until health and personal reasons forced him to step down, at which point Jabs returned, and the classic Scorpions lineup was born.<br /><br />The album opens with \\"Loving You Sunday Morning\\", and it's a blast - you can hear what will become the best known Scorpions' sound in it, with Klaus Meine's clear vocals and the ringing twin guitars. It's quickly followed by \\"Another Piece of Meat\\", which is a blazing rocker with some interesting lyrics, easily one of the hardest rocking pieces on the album. The semi-mellow but still great \\"Always Somewhere\\" is next, followed by the instrumental \\"Coast to Coast\\", in which the Schenker brothers show off their blazing guitar work.<br /><br />\\"Can't Get Enough\\" is another hard rocker, with the quintessential Scorpions' sound that will be repeated on albums for years to come. The slightly softer (but still rocking) \\"Is There Anybody There?\\" is next, followed by the fast & furious title track, and the album ends with the song \\"Holiday\\", another great rocker.<br /><br />This is an album that is easy to listen to again and again... a definite must for any Scorpions collector and fan. If you're lucky, you might be able to find the original album cover, showing the man and woman in a car - otherwise it'll be the 'non-offensive' blue & black scorpion. But the album cover obviously doesn't affect the music - this is a great album, well worth it for any of the songs.
B00012QM8G|4.0|Enter Steven Spielberg, and enter a gut-wrenching, eye-opening, heartbreaking tale of war and genocide on the European Jews. This story from start to finish takes you on an emotional roller coaster. Oskar Schindler, a member of the Nazi party during the time of the Holocaust, finagles a brilliant idea. If Jews were used to run his business, the cost would be significantly less. With the help of his new business accountant, Itzhak Stern, Schindler creates a war time business, that creates more money that he can use in a lifetime.   Over time, Oskar begins to battle with the ideologies of the war, and begins to journey through a path of discovery upon himself. He does kind things for the Jews, and even helps to the point of bringing on more workers, so that his workers do not feel the horrible pain of working labor camps.  At the end of the movie, Schindler realizes that all of his workers are leaving to ultimately be extinguished from society. Because of the bond he has formed, primarily with Stern, but with others of his workers, he decides to purchase these Jews to prevent them from further harm. He sets up the arrangement for them to be sent to a new camp, in his home town, where they will work. He purchases 1100 Jewish slaves. He runs his company into the ground, but in the seven months it operates, Schindler prevented these slaves from death or punishment, and even allow them to practice their religion.  This movie speaks volumes of one man's ability to change the world. Oskar Schindler saved 1100 Jews from execution, a monumental help to the Jewish community. There are now 6,000 Schindler Jews that exist in the world, a feat that would not have happened without this man's hard work and loyalty to the Jewish people.   The movie shows of horror and pain that the Jews experienced in Poland, and at labor camps. It is by far one of the hardest movies I've ever tried to watch, but the discovery that there are good people in bad times makes the movie worthwhile to see.

B002VPE1B6|3.0|3D is a rip-off. Why? The color depth capability of most newer HDTVs is around 24 to a high of 48-bit (Panasonic, etc.). Software (movies) currently being released are 8-bit for standard DVD and 16-bit color depth for Blu-Ray. All the studios needed to do was increase their movie release's color depth to [say] 36-bit and we would all have great 3D - and no dorky 3D glasses to wear. But the hardware (manufacturers) and software (studios) industry would not make any money doing that. They have to stick it to us once again and shove another \\"format\\" down our throats. Ain't greed wonderful! Now we have to purchase a new 3D capable HDTV and Blu-Ray player and all new movies, again! Not going to happen here! 3D will fail again, as it did many decades ago because it is still a gimmick - not real.    To clarify my statement above, I purchased the Blu-Ray 3D version of the new \\"Journey to the Center of the Earth\\" with Brandon Fraser. The home 3D effect on that movie was so distracting, that I got nothing out of it the first time around in 3D, until I watched it in 2D. Also, and this may be a stretch, but the 2D movie's color seemed washed out. I think the studio intentionally reduced the color level [depth] on the 2D version of that movie so the 3D version would look better (the packaging included both 3D and 2D versions). My 60-inch Pioneer Elite Kuro plasma (36-bit color depth) doesn't lie to me about things like that.    BTW, I have never seen this film. I never go to theaters because why waste the money when you can watch it without all the chaos and hassle found in theater environments, etc. I hear it is good though, and I am looking forward to seeing it. I especially like the idea that it is not being released in 3D (at least this time). However, I would like some addition footage not shown in theaters, so I will (also) wait for the extended edition release.    If you \\"fall\\" for 3D, the corporations will, once again, laugh at you [fools] all the way to their banks. Boycott 3D!

B000055Y0Y|5.0|Frank Horrigan is a secret service agent who keeps thinking back to November 22, 1963, when, as a hand-picked agent by President Kennedy, he became one of the few agents to have lost a President to an assassin when Kennedy died. Now, former CIA assassin Mitch Leary is stalking the current President, who is running for re-election. Mitch has spent long hours studying Horrigan, and he taunts Horrigan, telling him of his plans to kill the President. Leary plans to kill the president because Leary feels betrayed by the government, Leary was removed from the CIA, and the CIA is now trying to have him killed. After talking to Leary, Horrigan makes sure he is assigned to presidential protection duty, working with fellow secret service agent Lilly Raines. Horrigan has no intention of failing his President this time around, and he's more than willing to take a bullet. White House Chief of Staff Harry Sargent refuses to alter the President's itinerary, while Horrigan's boss, Secret Service Director Sam Campagna, is supportive of Horrigan. As the election gets closer, Horrigan begins to doubt his own abilities, especially when Horrigan's colleague Al D'Andrea is killed by Leary. But Horrigan may be the only one who can stop Leary. \\"In The Line of Fire\\" delivers a great game of cat and mouse. Quite simply a well-made, well-written and wonderfully acted movie. Eastwood is classic as grizzled Secret Service Agent Frank Horrigan and Rene Russo holds her own as partner  Lilly Raines. The movie's greatness comes from John Malkovich as \\"Booth\\". He captures this character's rage and hatred, as well as his humanity.  A great movie to see and peek into an assassin's mind and be on the edge of your seat the whole way through. I highly recommend it.

0393316041|5.0|Fantastic book of short life stories.  I am not a \\"physics\\" guy but all these tales, even the ones with hard core science, were easily accessible.  The writing style is fantastic and you really get to know the author so well.  He was a great writer, scientist, and human being.  Some of the way he deals with his personal life are... odd -- but it only adds to his quirky scientist persona.
0385340990|4.0|I had this book for a year before I read it.  What do they say about not judging by the cover?? I guess that goes for the title also.  This book captured my attention within 15min. and I finished it much too soon.  I want to go to Guernsey. So many little facts about the Occupation that have been glossed over and forgotten.  What strong characters to survive with little food and NO SOAP!! I wanted it to go on and on and I felt that I knew these people personally and could feel and taste the sea air.
030745455X|5.0|I read this pretty substantial book in one weekend. What more is there to say about this series that hasn't been written. It deserves all the hype and then some - however! Perhaps a bit overkill in the end on this one vs. his first but the fight scene in the warehouse more than makes up for it. This is a withdrawal inducing series of books. Warning: you will spend much time and money trying to reproduce this high. I want more.

B00328G4V6|3.0|When an innovative artist dies before he or she has worn out their welcome, material that could only be released over their dead body is issued by their record company or estate (or both). And yes, it's about commerce.    Elvis Presley's concerts, outtakes, rehearsals and just plain noodlings have provided grist for multiple box sets. All of Charlie Parker's recorded solos -- often snippets only a few seconds long -- have been given the deluxe treatment. In the cases of Hank Williams and Buddy Holly, voice-and-guitar demos were overdubbed in an attempt to create a viable commercial product. Some listeners loved these ersatz versions, while other clamored for the unadulterated source material, which was eventually released with great fanfare.    Jimi Hendrix was no exception. In the years immediately following his death, there was a glut of Hendrix albums in the racks: unreleased studio tracks, concerts, jams, soundtracks, demos, sessions he played on as a sideman, compilations, and -- ultimately -- overdubbed versions of unfinished songs. Much of it was considered to be crap. \\"Hendrix never intended to release this!\\" has been a common assessment of his posthumous releases for decades. True enough, but he probably didn't intend to die young, either, and death redefines everything. Had he lived, his set at Woodstock wouldn't be any more relevant today than that of the Grateful Dead, and the contents of \\"Valleys of Neptune\\" would have never seen the light of day -- not in this form and not in their 1970s incarnation, either.     But Hendrix isn't here to finish these tracks, and nobody is qualified to do it for him. Experience Hendrix deserves some credit for trying to make some semblance of sense out of Jimi's catalogue, and for issuing this material pretty much the way he left it -- with good sound and at an affordable price. No, it's not a great album. It's not an album at all. It's 80 minutes of jams, backing tracks, and different versions of familiar songs. Takingit to a party won't make you popular. Its target demographic is those of us who hang on to every note Hendrix played and who care about bass runs and drum rolls. From that perspective, it's pretty interesting. Call it a nicely done official bootleg of odds and ends, if you will. It's all we're going to get. Jimi has left the building.

B002MU4NL8|5.0|I don't know if GALAXY QUEST ever came out on VHS. If it did that would make this a triple dip. But whatever it is this Blu-ray is definitely worth the money.  There are brand new extras in this edition that were not included in the DVD. And, if I am not mistaken, this is new cover art as well. There are all new interviews --- and all ten years after the movie was released! Watching this movie in high def brings that old theater memory very much alive. I can't recommend this one enough! Like many have said before, this is the best Star Trek movie --- EVER.
B000A2XC1C|5.0|The best Christmas family movie ever. It is a tradition in our house to watch every year. Awesome.
B0036EBARO|4.0|Goldfrapp's new album 'Head First' isn't much like their past material. What's most appealing about this new album is it's light, happy, 1980s vibe. This is definitely more pop than some of their older songs and is (for the most part) music you would just listen to in order to put yourself in a good mood and get happy. Goldfrapp stated that one of the influences for this album was the 'Top Gun' soundtrack and you can definitely detect the influences from that iconic album in this new effort from the group. There's a lot of synth, 80s pop influence and airy-sound to the vocals that makes 'Head First' feel like it was produced and made decades ago rather than this year.<br /><br />The Good: 'Head First' worked for me due to how accessible the music is. Usually for Goldfrapp, there's one song that clicked for me and the other tracks on the album just seem too serious or too out there for me to get into. I liked that the tracks of 'Head First' are kept light and the music happy and chippy. \\"Dreaming\\" with the wailing/trippy vocals is a fun ballad set to the beat of a dance song; \\"Rocket\\" may not be the deepest song lyrically but it's optimism and and whimsical lyrics is addictive and makes it a track that never gets old; \\"Believer\\" is very upbeat and catchy. What works best for most of these tracks is the rare emphasis on upbeat, happy music rather than an album full of tracks that are slow and rather depressing. After listening to 'Head First' the listener takes away a bit of optimism and comes off a bit happier than they were with the first tracks. With so much music seeming too heavy or albums that don't seem to have themes and focus points, it was nice to find an album that wasn't afraid of being pop and taking on the dated/happy tone of '80s pop music.<br /><br />The Bad: I felt the second half of the album, starting with the title track, dragged on a bit. I'm not sure but with the track \\"Head First\\" the album starts to sound a bit repetitive and the lyrics a tad bit on the weak side. Even the vocals seem a bit more relaxed, with less singing and more murmuring of the words. I definitely enjoyed the first tracks of the album more than the later part of the album. The tracks aren't bad but they didn't feel as if they were produced the same way or with the same fun/free spirit the first four tracks captured.<br /><br />In all, a fun, upbeat album. It doesn't feel very complex or busy, which works to its advantage. If you're looking for some easy listening, dance/pop music that'll remind you of the 1980s music scene, this album is definitely for you.ide.

0143058592|4.0|Fantastic fly-on-the-wall view of The Beatles in the recording studio. Emerick gives details & anecdotes of each of The Beatles albums he helped record, along with his personal opinion on John, Paul, George, & Ringo. His views on their personalities is somewhat one-dimensional with most of the praise being heaped on McCartney. However, his insight into The Beatles in the studio more than makes up for it. Interesting tidbits include how the band and their friends created all the ambient sounds on A Day in the Life, and how the underwater sound was achieved on the song Yellow Submarine (it involves water, a microphone, and a condom!)
B0035KGWR2|4.0|Amy MacDonald's debut \\"This is the life\\" was filled with Folk/Rock tales of Poison princes and Footballer's wives and sold 3 million copies worldwide.<br /><br />\\"A curious thing\\" takes off where that effort left off and while nothing is ground breaking (even the cover art is similar to her debut's), the songs are catchy with deeply observational lyrics and that voice that reminds one of The Cranberries' Dolores O'Riordan. Recorded at Paul Weller's home studio, he features on some songs.<br /><br />Opening is the sunny Cranberries-style Rocker \\"Don't tell me that it's over\\" followed by the pulsing \\"Spark\\" (written for murdered toddler Jamie Bulger).<br /><br />Some of the lyrics take a look at celebrity culture; \\"I got no roots\\" (which starts off as a ballad before picking up speed) has her singing \\"This life I lead, it's a curious thing, but I can't deny the happiness it brings\\", the bouncy \\"Next Big Thing\\" takes a look at reality TV wannabes and \\"This Pretty Face\\" has the lyrics \\"I don't care who does her hair / Or what clothes she wears.\\"<br /><br />Other standouts are the acoustic \\"My only one\\", the melancholic ballad \\"Your time will come\\", the piano ballad \\"What happiness means to me\\" (with a euphoric piano/string Coldplay-style coda), and the hidden acoustic cover of Bruce Springsteen's \\"Dancing in the dark\\".

So much more fun, without the intense intrigue of the shoppaholics (in my case a plus). A story is something that could actually happen, wich makes it more interesting. i wanted to read more. the language was easy, for us non-brits. loved loved loved it!!!!!!
1423101464|5.0|My son started reading the series in Nov 09, he needed book for by the beginning of Dec but we coudln't find it before we left the states, he is very picky when it comes to series that he reads as they all have to be in hardcover....the first copy that we ordered was missing some print so we called Amazon and they shipped us a new copy quite fast!
B000JMKNV0|1.0|I really disliked this book, and it was a plot that has been told over a dozen times.  What a waste of money and time!!<br /><br />Basically this is about Andrew, an ex military, ex US Marshall who lost his wife, and is having difficulty coping with reality, so the institution that he is placed at puts on this elaborate scheme to restore his mind.<br /><br />Lots of boring twists.
B002WIDRM6|5.0|I had never heard their music until the Grammy Awards.  I took a chance and ordered their CD and it is wonderful! Every song is good.  The music leaves you feeling warm and fulfilled... I then purchased all of their CD's and we listen to their music over and over!

B002FOQY04|5.0|This is a great album. The tracks just blend in with each other one after another.  Its a solid album. 10 years from now I'll still be playing this album.  I became a fan after hearing \\"Day and Night\\" and became a supporter<br />as soon as the album dropped.  I actually have 2 copies.  I also bought the deluxe edition. The blending of<br />singing and rapping was Mastered by Lauryn Hill, reemerged with Kanye West, Lil Wayne, Drake and now Kid Cudi.<br />They had to categorize this type of music some how so now they call it EMO Music short for Emotional Music/rap.<br />Its all music to me.  This is a classic. If anyone says otherwise they just arent into this type of style.  No need to bash it.  Just say it isnt for you.  I hope Kid Cudi sticks around along with a list of others.<br /><br />Kid Cudi, Kanye, Wale, Clipse, Drake, Lil Wayne, Asher Roth, Kids in the Hall, Lil Brother, Cool Kids,<br />Just to name a few. I love their music.
B000YEUUCK|5.0|This 2 DVD package is a very high quality production.  It's just like being at the Celine Dion show in Las Vegas.  The second DVD is all the behind-the-scenes action and is a great addition to the concert DVD.  If you are a Celine Dion fan, this DVD set is a must-have.  You will love it!  Celine shows that her singing voice is among the most beautiful ever, and second to none.
B003102JDM|5.0|Larry appeared as clueless to what was going around him as did Velvel, the Shtetl husband in the opening village scene, but slowly he learns in this dark comic tale by the Coen Brothers.  Larry finds himself principally having to contend with Sy, the 'malicious spirit' who has turned his world upside down by pursuing his wife, Judith.  He also finds himself on the verge of tenure, as well as hounded by the Columbia Record Club because of his son's passion of Jefferson Airplane and Santana.  Ever so slowly Larry's world begins to unravel and he feels powerless to do anything about it, and so he turns to his rabbi for answers.<br /><br />The film explores the causes of angst with all the wit and irony viewers have come to expect from the Coen Brothers, however \\"A Serious Man\\" takes on deeper ethical and moral and does one dare say religious tones, as Larry finds his whole life called into question, and unsatisfied by the anecdotes and allegories of his rabbi.  Underscoring Larry's trials and tribulations is his own son's personal journey into the psychedelic world of Jefferson Airplane, wonderfully played out in the lyrics of \\"Don't you want somebody to love?\\" as he prepares for his bar mitzvah.
B000305ZS4|5.0|The production on this album is a bit lackluster. In fact it's scratchy and grissley as HELL. But I think thats how it was meant to be heard. The barbarism of the production combined with the sophistication of the melodies are what makes the experience of \\"NIGHTSIDE ECLIPSE\\" so unforgetable to me.    I have not heard anything like this before this album nor have I after it. Pretty damn good.

B0039UTDFG|1.0|I have nothing against Oprah. I was very excited to watch the Premier of the Life Series on the Discovery Channel. However, once Oprah started talking you could tell she was reading off a script. Her voice sounded so monotone that within 20 mins I actually fell asleep. The visuals were stunning but I could not stay awake through her narration, it was like a sleeping pill. I'll be picking up Attenborough's version and hopefully it'll be more exciting.
B002VPE1B6|1.0|This is a film to see once just to see what other people were talking about, not worth the expense of purchasing any form of it.  It purports Hollywood's standard theme that corporations and military personnel are bad and greedy people making this film trite and boring.  It reminded me of a very expensive Fern Gully.
B00005JLIU|4.0|This is a film for fans of Julie Andrews, Carol Channing and Mary Tyler Moore; big splashy musical numbers; the Hollywood romantic view of the twenties. The costumes are \\"really spiffy\\".  Not much storyline, but if you let yourself go, this is a lot of fun.  Warning:  This is NOT a racially sensitive film.  The reflection of the Asian community will make you cringe.
B0010X73ZG|5.0|I usually reserve five stars for stuff like Schindler's List, Sound of Music, Almost Famous, Fear and Loathing, etc...<br /><br />What surprised me the most:  1. a stephen king adaptation usually always gets butchered, and/or is horrifyingly bad. 2. I can't believe Dimension Films put out something that was actually stunning.<br /><br />Like others have said, the ending, 'UNREAL' Absolutely unreal...I just love the way the movie was filmed almost documentary style, ya know, like it doesn't look like it was done on 35mm, and just the way the film, as I am sure others have stated more fluently than I, transcends the emotional and psychological rollercoaster of something supernatural like this, rather than from just a horror, gore, B Movie, Wes Craven/John Carpenter standpoint.<br /><br />Really,really, really well done.
B002VECM6S|4.0|The Blind Side is a touching and always entertaining movie about an homeless African American teen named Michael (Quinton Aaron) that's taken in by a strong dominating white woman (Sandra Bullock) and her whipped husband (Tim McGraw). They buy him clothes, feed him and even help train him to get him ready to play football, among many other things.<br /><br />  The movie is a little overly happy through-out, even the visit from Bullock to Michael's drug addict mother goes a lot better than you'd expect. I wonder how Bullock's character would have handled Precious's mother lol. Since in the Blind Side all the men certainly seem to just shut-up and do as she says. Tim McGraw isn't bad as her husband, but his character isn't developed much. He's just Bullock's yes man basically and she's his boss even if he does play her husband. Hell, when she's ready to bring home Michael for the first time and doesn't even ask, McGraw just says \\"this is the part where I say yes\\", is he whipped or what ? lol. While Quinton Aaron is good as a huge huggable teddy bear, he doesn't get many lines. Bullock says he changed her life, but we just see how she changed his, she was already a tough and dominating woman before she even met him.<br /><br />  The movie may be about manly stuff like football and a big African American knocking people around playing the sport, but the Blind Side is really about the strong women that influenced Michael. I say women, because Kathy Bates' character tutors him to try and help him get his grades up, while Kim Dickens plays a teacher that also believes in Michael when no one else does.<br /><br />  So yeah, I a had a small problem with how the Blind Side makes men look clueless in need of the help of women, it even makes Michael's football coach appear that way. Despite having a problem with that, there was still no doubt in my mind that I was watching a special movie and one of the best of 2009. It gets to you emotionally and Bullock is less over the top than I expected, she shows that she can do more than just bad romantic comedies. Bullock proves that she's right up there with good actresses like Julia Roberts and not just a poor man's Julia Roberts lol.han I expected, she shows that she can do more than just bad romantic comedies. Bullock proves that she's right up there with good actresses like Julia Roberts and not just a poor man's Julia Roberts lol.
B00006CXSS|5.0|My family has seen Band of Brothers many times. It is an absorbing look at Easy Company's experience in Europe during WWII. The episode where they first encounter a concentration camp has vividly stayed with me. This film series helps to remind us that we must never forget. It is definitely a must have for everyone.
0399534601|5.0|This book was FABULOUS! It was completely different to what I expected as it expects 'user input' and is not a book to be read from one cover to the other.     My recommendation - get it! You'll love it!
0060005696|5.0|This book is a conscience awakening.  \\"The Paradox of Choice\\" is insightful, well written and informative. Throughout the book Schwartz has studies that back up his findings, and further validate his argument of why more is less,however he could of condensed the book down from 226  page to 100 pages thus adopted the paradox of \\"less is more.\\"    Schwarts focuses on two personality types. First, is the Maximizer. A person that is in constant quest for the \\"best\\". The back lash of searching for the best is the residual effect of never being safisfied or happy after the decision is made based on fear of regret.  The opposite of a maxizer is a Satisficer.  A satisficer is content with something that is \\"good enough\\" which is based on personal standards. They are able to make a choice and be safisfied and move on with their life.    I learned from reading this book that as a whole we should all strive to be a satisficer, not a maximizer. The terminology throughout the book was very informative and educational. Schwarts writing is intriguing and gives you the feeling of \\"ahh...now I get it!!\\", even if it seemed to be common sense. He has a brilliant and insightful way of opening your mind to look at life differently.  The book is focused on how individuals in todays modern society are over whelmed by choices, but gives an 11 step solution at the end of the book on how to achieve a happer and more fulfilling life.

And if you like to laugh and don't take life too seriously, then I recommend it to you, too. :)
0812973992|5.0|My sister sent me Let the Great World Spin: A Novel for my birthday and I was unfamiliar with both the author and the book.  Having been enthralled with, Man on Wire, the film of Philippe Petit's tightwalking endeavors, I was excited to begin the novel which I assumed would be a straightforward fictional narrative of the public's reaction to Petit's feat of walking on air between New York City's World Trade Center's twin towers in 1974.  I was so wrong.  Colum McCann opens his novel with Petit's surreptitious and halting act, but in Book One moves to Ireland in the 1950's where we are introduced to a pair of brothers who we follow to NYC.  The novel sways to and fro as did Petit on wire, from decade to decade, character to character, until the reader realizes they are all interwoven, characters and events affecting one another throughout the three Books which comprise the novel.  Characters are developed, history is revealed, and culture is defined among the ruins of lives, unpredictable liaisons, and outcomes which I personally interpreted as positive in the end.  I am not a linear thinker by nature, so I believe that I am the perfect audience for this very intricately commingled story about an assortment of individuals who are not as dissimilar as one would expect.  If you're looking for an a-b-c-d format in this tale, you'll likely be disappointed.  On the other hand, if you prefer short bursts of complexities which keep your recollection in check, then perhaps you'll savor this book and think it's one of the best you've read in the past year as much as I did.

0143113100|5.0|Having read many recent books about the brain, I was reluctant to read yet another. However, upon my daughter's urging -- she is a knowledgeable psychologist -- I read Dr. Doidge's \\"The Brain that Changes itself.\\" And I'm glad I did. The book opens a new frontier. I learned more from Dr. Doidge's book than from all others on the topic. And it is a pleasure to read it (I'm re-reading it now)! His style is easy, the contents fascinating, and his organization of the material brilliant. I catch myself thinking, aha, so that is why I do this -- and I can change it, and this is how. Our recognition that the brain is plastic and can indeed be changed opens a new frontier and hope for all of us. More important, Dr. Doidge clearly demonstrates how strongly parents impact the future of their children, especially during their early years. It's an enormous, but inspiring responsibility we face, not only toward our offspring but also toward society. Roswitha McIntosh, author
1439153663|5.0|I fell in love with the characters & felt so much a part of their life, the story pulled me in. The details of charater, food, but life were critical for me to understand something so foreign to me  & made it impossible to put down each night.  I wanted the story to go on--didn't want it to end.
B0000033K2|5.0|I saw a lot of complaints about all the outtakes but personally, i love the outtakes.  It's not like each outtake is the same and it's fascinating to hear the progression of the song, for example hearing coltrane work out his soloing on giant steps, starting off with mediocre solos finally working up to what you hear on the album.  It's also cool to hear it taken at different tempos, we've all heard it at the extremely fast hard bop tempo but to hear it at a medium tempo is something else.  I think this collection is definitely a must own for any trane fan.  It includes all his albums from atlantic which if you're just starting out listening to coltrane than this is an amazing place to start because it's his early work.  Many people favor the love supreme years with impulse but i think when giant steps came out, it changed jazz more.  Coltrane's solo on giant steps really just pushed jazz improv to a whole new level, so to hear the rest of the atlantic albums is just as amazing.  I think that if you're a hardcore fan this is for you and if you're just starting out and dont want to purchase each album separately then you definitely should purchase this product.
B0004Z33F0|4.0|The film is basically about Rambo going into Afghanistan to rescue his former commanding officer and along the way helps afghan rebels fight Russian invaders    The pros in my opinion. I love a good action film now and then. And Rambo has plenty of action. The 1990 Guinness World Records deemed Rambo III the most violent film ever made at the time, with 221 acts of violence, at least 70 explosions, and over 108 characters killed on-screen. If you want action then this film is for you. If you're a Stallone fan then this film is for you. I like that the film is based based on a real life war that was going on. I was really feeling this film and the character Stallone has crated when he was infiltrating the Russian base. Him sneaking around under tanks,jumping through holes and creeping around made me feel like I was in a real life metal gear solid game. The last battle with him driving the tank fighting a helicopter was the icing on the cake for a great ending battle scene. The film has some extras features as well. I haven't been through most of them,but enjoyed the directors commentary very much. The dialogue in the film isn't the greatest,but I don't watch action films expecting Shakespeare. I want see to Rambo kick some butt and that's pretty much all to it.    Now the cons. Not much I didn't like about the film. There isn't a deep storyline here. Not much character development. Anybody wanting a more realistic idea of soldiers in battle should look someplace else. The movie spent some time showing Afghans playing games like putting a dead sheep in a circle. I felt that it was a bit of a waste of time and wanted Rambo to get right to it. The main Russian bad guy was pretty much not worth talking about or even remembering. I really wish they could get a memorable enemy for the Rambo films. I do kind of wish the film could have spent a bit  more time on the plight of the Afghans and war crimes the Russians were committing against them. As some have mentioned here there are a few corny lines in the script which could have been worked on.     All in all I really enjoyed this film and think it's underrated in America. It's a great action film with pretty much a comic book view on war. Many people say this one was the weakest in the series,but I love them all. Easily worth the low price the are asking for it on amazon.
B000W93CXQ|5.0|this is my first review ever. i am not good at reviews nor do i expect to be. thirteen reasons why however touched my heart and made me cry. over and over again. it also made me read in class (thank goodness i wasn't caught). i have had the same list of my top ten books for several years. then i read thirteen reasons why and it moved straight up to second place.    clay jensen was just enjoying a normal day when a package arrives on his doorstep. in the package were some tapes from hannah baker. only one problem. hannah baker is dead. so clay starts listening to the tapes. he finds out that there are thirteen reasons hannah baker died. these reasons are people. hannah swears to drag the thirteenth person down to hades with her. could clay be the thirteenth person? clay goes on an emotional journey trying to figure out what he did to hurt hannah. clay starts looking at others differently and soon he finds himself falling in love with hannah baker, all over again.
B00003CX7L|5.0|Toy Story 2 on vhs is a wonderful movie, just as good as the first Toy Story movie.  I was very happy that I was able to get a copy on vhs to add to my collection. I have seen just about all of the Disney movies and this is among one of my favorites, as well as the rest of my family.

B00005QGAX|5.0|I am not a die-hard Michael \\"King of Pop\\" fan. However, when reviewing his short lived career. \\"Off the Wall\\", \\"Thriller\\", and \\"Bad\\" are a magnificant acheivment for any artist and the producer(Quincy Jones)to realize in the turbulent 80's music environment that produced much less of importance in this time period. Of course, I love U2, R.E.M., etc. but to ignore this music and cast it off because of personal differences to where Michael ended up is criminal. Love the music!
B002PMV9FG|5.0|i just read one other reviewers review and i agree with most of what he said. i think they did leave alot of important stuff out, i think the filmmakers hurried on making this movie. but it was still a good movie, mabey they'll make a directors edition and make it better. who knows. but i do have one thing to say if they did go by the book it would of been a 4 hour movie. i think they wanted to concentrate on more of voldamort's past and slughorns deception. it was an awesome movie. i can't wait until the deathly hallows.
0385504225|5.0|As a writer, I find Dan Brown to be exquisitely entertaining while utilizing factual information that propels his fictional novel(s) into the mindful masterpiece.  The \\"Da Vinci Code\\" placed the bar so high that sequels were nearly impossible to compete. Taking the effort to read his trilogy in order is worth the discipline of anticipation.  Reading other reviews compelled me to write my own in support of Brown's efforts.  So to the others who so harshly criticised his works I have only one statement to make:       \\"Great spirits have always encountered violent opposition from mediocre minds.\\"                     Albert Einstein
B00006FDCJ|5.0|I'm not certain how much I would like \\"Unforgiven\\" if I had never seen a Western before.  I suspect I would still consider it a masterpiece.  But approaching it from the perspective of decades of watching \\"Cowboys and Indians\\", I view Clint Eastwood's Oscar winner as one of the most important achievements in film history.<br /><br />Eastwood created the Man With No Name personna in Sergio Leone's spaghetti westerns, masterpieces that changed the genre.  But Unforgiven elevates \\"The Western\\" to a level I think will never be approached again.  \\"Unforgiven\\" is to The Western as \\"The Godfather\\" is to the gangster movie.<br /><br />In old Lone Ranger era Westerns the hero wore a white hat and dispatched bad guys in morally unambiguous gunfights.  By the end of John Wayne's career in cowboy pictures heroes weren't as clearly defined. In pictures like \\"The Searchers\\" and \\"The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance\\" the heroes had skeletons in their closets. Then Leone's films made the West seem an even grittier, sweatier place, and there was more than a little anti-hero in the leading characters.  Still, gunfights happened quickly and the winner was always a dead-eye who could shoot the wings off a gnat at a hundred paces.  The losers of gunfights fell quickly and silently to their death.<br /><br />In Unforgiven Eastwood gives us a vision we can imagine as closer to the truth.  His character William Munny was once \\"a known thief and murderer, a man of notoriously vicious and intemperate disposition,\\" as we're told in the opening title card.  We learn Bill Munny was once the most dangerous of a group of outlaws in hints that are given leading up to the climax.  But Munny has been changed by marriage.  His comely wife has died of smallpox, leaving him a poor pig farmer with two children.  He hasn't shot at a man in eleven years.  We can feel his struggle for redemption.  In addition to giving up his previous life as a criminal, he has stopped drinking and, when given the opportunity at a woman younger and prettier than him, he declines out of respect for his dead wife.<br /><br />But Bill Munny's demons are old and powerful.  A group of prostitutes pool their money and spread the word that they'll pay a bounty for the death of a bad-tempered cowboy who cuts one of them. Jaimz Woolvett plays The Schofield Kid, who has heard of William Munny and how he was the meanest cold-blooded killer alive.  Munny initially declines the Kid's offer, but the Munny family is poor, and the prostitutes' bounty is tempting.<br /><br />Bill rounds up old partner Ned Logan, played by the always brilliant Morgan Freeman.  You get the feeling that Ned wasn't as bad as Munny in the old days, but you also get the idea that Ned isn't as \\"reformed\\" as Munny.<br /><br />Gene Hackman gives a superlative performance as Little Bill Daggett, the Sheriff of the town with the prostitutes.  In an early scene Daggett beats bounty hunter \\"English Bob\\" (played by the late, great Richard Harris) half to death, and vows to do worse to any other bounty hunter's seeking the \\"whores' gold\\".<br /><br />Unforgiven re-writes the legend of the west.  Shifting shades of grey replace black and white.  The Man With No Name could shoot a gnat mid-flight, but William Munny takes shooting practice at a tin can with a pistol, misses several shots, then finally dispatches the can with a shotgun blast. The gunfight losers in old school westerns did their dying quickly and quietly, while a victim in this film dies slowly, in agony and begging for a drink of water.<br /><br />In an expository scene halfway through Hackman explains to a hack writer (acting as a one-man Greek chorus and wonderfully played by Saul Rubinek) that the stories of famous gunfights that circulated among taverns and dime novels of the day were wild exaggerations made up by the survivors to make themselves look faster and deadlier and more noble than they really were.<br /><br />Eastwood gives a master's class in film story-telling.  He tells us - then he shows us.  Every other Western appears a lamb-in-wolf's-clothing poser in comparison.  This film is the whole Wolf, and makes no apologies about it. If a greater Western than \\"Unforgiven\\" is ever made - I can't wait to see it.b-in-wolf's-clothing poser in comparison.  This film is the whole Wolf, and makes no apologies about it. If a greater Western than \\"Unforgiven\\" is ever made - I can't wait to see it.
B002VKE1K2|1.0|Movie was not good.  Tried to imititate \\"The Blair Witch Project\\" which at least was quite a good movie.  Couldnt watch this on my DVD player as it was asking for a Regional Code to be entered???  Big disappointment.
1400052173|5.0|This book had me crying, laughing, angry, happy, depressed, and exhilarated.  Rebbecca is to be commended for her research on such an amazing story.  I learned to love Henrietta Lacks and her family.  I was not surprised at the deceit but I was dissappointed in our doctors and scientists.  I was truly interested in the science and I learned much from this book.  This may sound strange but as I was reading this book, I felt as if Henrietta was a gift from God.  So much was accomplished with the use of her cells.  Thanks for informing us, Rebecca.
B000JMKNV0|5.0|This is my new favorite book. It kept me guessing until the very end.  And not in the way that makes you feel stupid for not having figured it out on your own.  I would recommend this book to anyone who has time on their hands to sit and read for hours because it is impossible to put down.
B0031RAOVY|5.0|This movie is a rare find and movie making at its best.      When was the last time you saw a really good G-rated movie that can move you to tears that had with no violence, cgi or special effects?  I commend the excellent job of the writers, cast, director, producers, akita dogs, and all those behind the scenes like the dog trainers/handlers and staff to produce this amazing film of the love between a man and his dog and the unceasing loyalty of this beloved dog.  This film touched me and if you are an animal lover, I'm sure it will have you in tears too.  I wish they made more movies of this caliber.
B0007R4TAS|2.0|I've always loved this version and was delighted to be able to purchase it on DVD.  However, the quality is extremely poor.  It looks like it was taped off an old television set.  There are skips in it, scratchy sound and lines that wiggle across the screen like an old home movie.  And yet, I am happy to have it.  They never play it anymore on television and I really do like the story.  I just wish it was in better shape.  At least the price was right!
B002JH3TW8|5.0|Okay, it's not the sexiest product I've ever purchased--but this cable seems sturdy and well-made.  Apple must think so too as they sell it (for a higher price) on their own website.  I have connected several devices to my 27\\" iMac--drives, camcorders, etc.--without any issues.  And it's a cable--not a hard adapter--which means chances of breakage (either of the cable or my computer) by being accidentally bumped are minimized.  Go for it!

B00127RAJY|5.0|When this first came in the mail I waited 2 weeks before starting it. I think that I was a bit intimidated by the other reviews. I didn't want to start something then stop because it was too hard. After finally putting it in and finishing the 25 minutes I knew I was hooked. This is a great workout if you are pressed for time. She definatly makes you sweat! I'm only on level 2 and won't advance until I can make it through without taking a breather. I was definatly sore the next day only I'm not sure if it was due to the short cool down and minimal stretching or if it was because of the workout. I haven't seen any changes in my weight yet but then it hasn't been 30 days. I also just started weight watchers so I will keep you posted. 5 stars for the hard core workout. I make sure to add a bit more stretching at the end.
B00005JLKB|5.0|I am finally seeing what the fuss was about.  This is an interesting take on the whole Superman legacy, with Tom Welling playing the young Clark Kent as a teen in a little town in Kansas, but in modern times.  He has abilities that his adoptive parents want to hide, he yearns for a lovely girl named Lana, and at this time he is great friends with the conflicted Lex Luthor, a billionaire's son who is torn between what his father wants for him and what he wants to do on his own.      John Schneider also does a nice job as Jonathan Kent, while the other cast members, pretty much unknown before this series, are solid.  It's interesting to watch Clark hone his skills in his slow rise to Superman, while we all know that one day, Lex will give in to the dark side and become his enemy.

0446567337|4.0|\\"Dear John\\" is Nicholas Sparks's story of a romance between John Tyree, a young man who joins the Army after drifting purposelessly for several years after graduation from high school, and Savannah Curtis, a fledgling special education teacher. They meet while John is on leave and Savannah is working with Habitat for Humanity.  They love each other very much, but there are obstacles in their romance.  John doesn't understand his father; Savannah has some thoughts about his father, but it's too soon for her professionally to discuss them, and it leads to a major quarrel between the two.<br /><br />The most important event to get in the young lovers' way, however, is 9/11.  John, like many in the military at that time, reenlists, but he probably would have had extra time added on anyway because of 9/11.  Other obstacles in the lovers' way lead Savannah to do what the title implies -- write John a \\"Dear John\\" letter.<br /><br />I found this to be a typical Sparks novel -- sad and \\"fluffy\\" at the same time.  It is well-written, but I have to give it four stars because it is so much like Sparks's other works.  There is a surprise in the ending, but readers won't have much trouble figuring out where this novel is going.  Readers who want to curl up with a well written but \\"fluffy\\" book will like this, but it's fluff, not meat-and-potatoes.
B002L3RVCY|5.0|I have been a long time viewer of Star Wars and I love this take on it. This is fresh without being confusing. Seeing Yoda battle the enemy so easily is priceless! This series is great viewing for everyone. If season 2 is anything like season 1, this will be a long series.
B00320HN00|2.0|My husband gave me a copy of the special edition for Christmas, and I only recently finished it.  I haven't listened to the CD yet, but the other bonus material did not live up to the hype.  A full color poster printed in the inside of the book jacket?  It looks like a sketch to me, with maybe five different colors.  The interview and other back matter were interesting, but I could take them or leave them.<br /><br />As for the story itself, my title says it all.  What happened?!  After enjoying the first three books of the \\"Twilight\\" series, I see this one as going out with a whimper instead of a bang.  There are several incidents in the plot that don't seem plausible at all, even if I try to consider the genre of the work and call back the imagination I had as a dreamy teenage girl.  I found myself thinking, \\"Say WHAT?  Would that character really do that?\\" and even \\"UGH!\\" several times.  Meyers can do much better than this.<br /><br />Readers who want to go ahead and finish the series should at least wait until the trade-paperback version comes out or check this book out from the library. Don't waste money on the additional material, and don't spend more than you have to for the story itself. This one's not a keeper.
B001ADPMQS|5.0|This movie is just the best. Took me back to being a little kid all over again. I have a two year old son and a ten year old daughter and they both thought it was awesome. Would recomend this for anyone who enjoys being a kid at heart when the world is so tuff.
B002Q4U9YU|3.0|Very happy with this CD. Thought there was gonna be more new stuff but there was only 1 new song. That was the only thing that was disappointing.This is just a greatest hits cd.
B000UJ48WC|5.0|The USA blu-ray is 144 minutes.    The UK blu-ray is 119 minutes.    Overall, the quality of the film is stunning.    If you haven't seen The Shining before, I recommend the 119 minute version.
B0031S4K5E|4.0|It's very rare to see a DVD coupled with a plush toy like this, especially from a movie under the Disney banner.  They like to keep those things separate so they can generate more income.  But this gift set is perfect for Ponyo!  After watching the film, how can you not pine for one of these Ponyo Plushies?!    You may want to be careful, however.  The construction of the plushie may differ in quality.  For example, mine has a shorter \\"skirt\\" than the one I saw at the store about a week after I recieved mine.  But that's a personal pet peeve and shouldn't bother anyone that isn't very nit-picky about their stuffed toys.    Now if only Disney did this with Totoro...
1439190275|5.0|My husband and I are trying to conceive.  Unfortunately, due to many years of eating high carb processed food, I have PCOS.  I am also showing signs of potential diabetes.  It was recommended to me by my doctor that I get my insulin under control.  Within DAYS of starting Phase 1, I started my cycle, which I hadn't had for over a year, even taking Clomid.  I recommend this to anyone who wants to be healthier, but most especially to women who want children but have fertility issues.
1423119509|5.0|Reviewing the physical product and shipping (my son is reading the books, and loving them)....  I was nervous about ordering this from Amazon, since some previous reviews described shipping damage.  But the package arrived double-boxed and well padded, so there was no damage to the faux steamer trunk souvenir box.  Books were in perfect condition, too.  Great job, Amazon!
184744346X|5.0|What an absolute classic this book was- far and away the best rock biography, and probably the funniest book, I ever read.  What's not to like about the Ozzy, especially since his wife-strangling, self-soiling, animal abusing days are behind him (all of which he repeatedly regrets and takes full responsibility for)?  He's a gracious and self-made family man who expresses gratitude for the cards he's been dealt, recognizing himself as perennially the least likely to succeed.  He is modest and self-deprecating, and frequently acknowledges the great talent of other industry giants he feels lucky to have rubbed shoulders with (Led Zeppelin, Brian Wilson, David Bowie, Randy Rhoads).  I Am Ozzy was written in the singer's friendly, conversational yet occasionally confused style, with fantastic turns of phrase, jokes, words of praise, and loads of stories throughout.<br /><br />Above all else, Ozzy is hilarious.  He opens with the admission that his many addictions prevent him from fully recounting his rich history, but [expletive] it, he might as well try anyway, and then treats us to 416 pages of bumbling and profane comedy.  The book begins with descriptions of his poor but audacious upbringing, culminating in a bar fight postscript during which a stitched-up, 20 year old Ozzy waxes philosophical about the differences between his dour English scene and the hippy-dippy San Francisco culture then permeating the airwaves.  [San Francisco (Be Sure to Wear Some Flowers in Your Hair) vs. Aston (Be Sure to Wear Some Glass in Your Face).]<br /><br />Ozzy's childhood misadventures and loser adolescent jobs include having a stolen TV land on him during an attempted fence-climbing getaway; working at car horn factory and passing out after huffing fumes at the degreasing machine; and getting kicked into the blood chute by a cow he was trying to kill at his slaughterhouse job.  There are hysterical Black Sabbath and solo career anecdotes: a drug-addled Tony Iommi trying to play the flute onstage despite missing his mouth; license-less Ozzy buying a horse to take him back and forth to the pub; band pranks like shaved eyebrows, fake house hauntings and ghosts, and live snakes tossed onstage.  The midget auditions during the Diary of A Madman tour are straight out of Spinal Tap.<br /><br />The substance abuse stories are comedy at its finest.  Ozzy is Inspector Clousseau, Jerry Lewis, and Mr. Magoo rolled into one coked up package.  He dosed animals and people alike (his local vicar, a woman bothering him on a commercial flight, the band Yes...), both accidentally and on purpose.  He attended the Betty Ford clinic thinking it was a place to learn how to drink with sophistication, like a gentleman.  He flushed and snorted enough coke to kill an ox after thinking Sabbath's temporary Bel Air headquarters were being raided by the cops, only to realize that drummer Bill Ward had tripped the emergency call button when adjusting the room thermostat.  Ozzy was kicked out of a tour of the Dachau concentration camp for being drunk and disorderly.<br /><br />There was a string of about 40 pages beginning on about page 218 where I couldn't make it through a half page without laughing out loud.  And the final chapter's dialogue between Ozzy and his new physician is absolutely priceless.<br /><br />Everything is here, for fan and curious non-fan alike.  You want details about the stuff from Behind the Music, like the dove and bat chomping, the Alamo incident, the Rhoads plane crash, and the Suicide Solution controversy?  Check.  You want other crazed stories that don't appear as often in print, like Ozzy's going ballistic in his own chicken coop, his passing out on the highway after partying with Motley Crue, and his HIV diagnosis?  Check.  You want Ozzy's take on the black arts, and whether he and the band's interest in the occult was genuine or a marketing tool?  Check.

B001KW0C96|5.0|As is often the case here, the reviews of this movie are all over the lot.  I don't understand the negative ones at all.  I watched this movie last night and thoroughly enjoyed it.  After having watched the completely disappointing U-571 the night before, this was a particular treat.  I give it high marks from top to bottom.  The acting, as one would expect, is excellent, and I thought the story line was fascinating.  Call me simple, but I was surprised at the ending.  The blu-ray picture and sound were excellent.  I've had this movie for a few weeks and had put off watching it because of all the negative and lukewarm reviews it has received.  Everyone seems to have a different opinion of this movie.  I thought it was great.

B0036EBARO|5.0|Goldfrapp slowly started rising to world fame when their first LP 'Felt Mountain' was released in 2000.  It was hipnotic, had hints of Electropop, Electronic music, and most of all - was far in the left field, which I tend to like that kind of LP/Music most of the time.      In the middle of 2003 Goldfrapp changed their stage, so to speak, after releasing their 2nd (one of their biggest selling) LP 'Black Cherry'.  One of the singles off of the 'Black Cherry' LP reached the top of the U.S. Dance charts (\\"Strict Machine\\").      In 2005, the world was introduced to pure Glam Electronic Rock, as I call it.  It was ranked as my favorite, to date, and then they hit rock bottom with 'Seventh Tree' in 2008.  I didn't care for any of it, accept the song \\"Happiness\\".  It was a decent song/track, but overall, the LP was at the bottom of the list for me.    Finally, I was hyped when hearing about their latest venture to be released in March of 2010... 'Head First'.  I was so hoping they would veer away from the folk-ish sounds they created on 'Seventh Tree'.  I sighed with relief when hearing and purchasing the new LP.  In my opinion, they are nearly back to form, as the smooth, professionally produced sounds of Synthpop and Electronic keyboards soar in the background of most of the tracks on 'Head First'.  And what a delight to hear the last track \\"Voicething\\".  Not a single oriented track, but it is so unique from most anything they have produced.  Off-the-wall, as I would call it, but nevertheless an excellent venture into dreamy opera-like voice overtones with flying synthetic background bass.    This, to date, is my 2nd favorite LP of Goldfrapp's catalog.  Some critics have pinned this LP for going backward, and in some sense of the matter it has, but in a good way of having the Olivia-ish vibe that I always liked in the early to mid 1980's.  Yes, I too, want what I call as well a \\"Supernature 2\\" LP, and I think they won't disappoint on that scenario in due time.  I highly suggest purchasing this dreamy and lively electronic-synth adventure.    Standout tracks:    \\"Rocket\\", \\"Alive\\", \\"Dreaming\\", \\"Hunt\\", \\"Shiny And Warm\\", and \\"Voicething\\".  Those are my top 6 (not in order).      From a Devoted Goldfrapp Fan ~
B000JMKNV0|5.0|I wanted to see the movie, but missed my chance at the independant theater. I got the book for free on Kindle (promotional period, I guess) and loved it. My only complaint about it is at times it got \\"sleepy\\" and I found myself skipping over a paragraph or two here and there.<br />Overall, I highly suggest reading this book!
0375805613|5.0|With a knowing wink at the Book of Revelation, the very title of The Monster at the End of this Book promises an unveiling of a horror.  As if that premise weren't titillating enough, a Grover, a hair-golem human proxy creature familiar to any child, materializes and at once begins an aggressive campaign of reverse psychology, goading us, the reader, into participation.  The Grover constructs barriers of increasing strength against forward progress. The barriers are, of course, virtual (as even the most backward student can perceive at once). Pages are turned; barriers are shattered. The Grover feigns increased agitation: it shouts, it pleads, it issues renewed warnings of the monster. It is a coy, calculated enticement, at once ingenious and disingenuous. The Grover is part Buddha, part sideshow huckster. His dharma: an apocalyptic strip-tease.  But suddenly the end is reached, and the promised monster is--aha! what's this?--the Grover itself, through a trick of semiotics.  No more pages lie ahead. This is a time for reflection. Behind us is still visible a trail of destroyed pages--broken lumber and scattered bricks, the remains of hastily-assembled and as-rapidly annihilated structures--our dojo--a reminder of our recent destructive desires. And before us, hovering in the void, our previously agitated guide has been replaced by a becalmed, compassionate master.  Its work is done; enlightenment is achieved. The Monster and the guide have become one; the Monster was us; the Monster was fear of the End. Fears and desires and monsters resolved, we are enlightened, free to move on.

B0036TGSR6|5.0|I was reluctant to see this film, fearing it might be dark and depressing.  I was very pleasantly surprised to find an interesting, well-made film that held my interest from the mysterious beginning to the almost amusing ending.  I won't relate the story since the Amazon reviewer and others have done that.  After seeing it I pondered just why it was so good.  Since I'm not a film student I couldn't analyze its components and come up with a good reason.  I concluded that it was just well-done, all around.     The casting is perfect.  Ewan McGregor is just right as the smart, but not-too smart guy who finds himself in a pretty mess when he accepted a ghost-writing job for a former British MP.  He is attractive, but doesn't overwhelm you with his charm.  This is no James Bond, and we like him a lot for his sort of vulnerable heroic qualities.      Pierce Brosnan is appropriately creepy as the PM, who used to be an actor back at Yale and Cambridge, and uses his talents in the political arena. Olivia Williams ('hope I got her name right) is super as his Harvard/Cambridge educated wife, and the brains in the family.  She is so funny and smart and pathetic and strong, in turn, that you want to root for her to get an Oscar nomination for best supporting actress next year.  (I hope they remember her.)    I thought Kim Cattrell was very good, too, as the PM's hyper-efficient assistant, and mistress.  Her accent may have wavered a bit but she had the attitude nailed down.  She's actually very funny.  There are brief appearances by a number of well known actors, not the least of whom is Eli Wallach.  They all add to the fun of the film, although this is not intended to be a funny film.    The dialogue is very smart, but again it doesn't overwhelm you with its cleverness.  Polanksi shows brilliance, subtlety and restraint in every aspect of the film, including the murky, menacing, seaside where most of the action takes place.  This is a smart guy and he knows how to make good films.    This is one of the few films I think I will see a second time.  I  recommend it.
B000HEWEEE|3.0|With Sandra Bullock this movie can't be too bad.  I thought it moved somewhat slowly.  I do like the time lapse aspect of the plot.
B00005JN2Z|5.0|Like good jazz Collateral is able to quietly move into your head before washing you away in an ocean of smooth chaos.  A tale of two men from two separate backgrounds meet one night in this dreary character-study in a night that will leave both changed forever.  The movie begins with a shady character exchanging briefcases in an airport.  Afterward we are suddenly thrown into a seemingly separate movie.  We are now transported into the life of taxi driver Max Durocher (Jamie Foxx), a gentle, soft-spoken man with big ambitions.  He meets a U.S. Justice Department prosecutor by the name of Annie Farrell (Jada Pinkett Smith) who needs a ride.  Not one to pass a pretty lady by he stops for her and shares a moving exchange of words; not Hollywood flirting, but natural conversation that shows two people connecting in a way few people are capable.<br /><br />After dropping the prosecutor off Max receives another passenger...  Vincent (Tom Cruise) is a grey haired, grey suit wearing man whose natural charm is radiant.  He requests that Max take him on five stops to visit some friends and to get him back to LAX airport by the end.  Max cites regulation, but when Vincent flashes six crisp hundred dollar bills he decides to make an exception.  But after the first drop off Vincent's profession is made clear when a corpse falls atop Max's cab.  Unable to escape Max is taken along for the ride as Vincent continues his job with professional precision.<br /><br />In this journey both men will learn from each other in this trek through the underbelly of Los Angeles.<br /><br />Director Michael Mann has created a tight thriller with equally award-worthy performances from his two leading men.  This isn't a crime movie with good guys and bad guys.  Collateral is a movie about people who do what is natural to them and actually have feelings.  Cruise is not some sort of post-Tarantino hit man who talks casually like the job is no big deal.  He operates with expert precision and knows the requirements of his job, but he doesn't do it out of pleasure, or amusement.  No, Vincent does it because killing is his job...but he never seems to enjoy his line of work.  His charisma and enthusiasm reflects that of the taxi driver played by Jamie Foxx who has been stuck in his boring job for twelve years and as such as a soft, kind speaking tone, but he lets people walk all-over him.  Both characters have something to learn from the other and that only makes their conversations more compelling to an audience.<br /><br />Mann drives a tight movie which explores the bad along with the good of each of its characters.  The violence is swift and sudden and will take an audience's breath away, but most of the film's brilliance is within its dialogue.  The final action scenes are well filmed and suspenseful, but I was left wishing for more conversations between Max and Vincent.  A film like this is a mixed bag in this aspect seeing as it seemed incapable of deciding on action, thriller, or drama.  The action and thriller aspects of it are good, but what makes this film great is entirely rested in the performances of Cruise and Foxx.<br /><br />9/10 Starshis job, but he doesn't do it out of pleasure, or amusement.

B003CN5SAY|5.0|One of the best cable shows ever broadcast, \\"Nip/Tuck\\" closes its doors at its plastic surgery clinic for the final time. This boxset includes all 19 episodes from the final season and comes with bonuses including a gag reel, deleted scenes, and an informative featurette called \\"Tell Me What You Don't Like About Youself?\\".<br /> To say that I am going to miss Sean and Christian as well as the rest of the cast is an understatement. Very rarely do we see shows of this caliber; the writing, acting, and production values are what made it stand out from most network shows and I doubt if we will ever see a series of this quality dramatizing stories with plastic surgery as its main content ever again.<br /> The final season has a slew of guest stars including the marvelous Vanessa Redgrave and hunky Mario Lopez reprising their roles from previous seasons. The stories are also daring as the season begins with Liz attempting to take Christian to the cleaners in a nasty divorce settlement; Julia's mother's attempt in adopting Annie; and the most shocking story in which Matt winds up in prison with his psychotic roomate wanting him to have breast implants!<br /> This wonderful boxset will be available in stores on June 8th, 2010.<br /> Goodbye \\"Nip/Tuck\\"...you were a class act!
B000MZHW40|4.0|Blood Diamond is one of those \\"Public Awareness\\" films that accomplishes its goal without relying on much preaching. In a way you could easily classify Blood Diamond as being a Hotel Rwanda film for audience members who aren't in the mood for pure drama.  So instead the issues are mixed into a classy, well thought out action thriller.  More recently we saw this concept used well in District 9, which addressed the issue of racism, slums, and xenophobia in South Africa.  This contemporary method of informing the public often turns in good films when done right and Blood Diamond does it right.<br /><br />Though not the greatest film dealing with conflict in Africa it draws enormous amounts of strength from  Leonardo DiCaprio and Djimon Housou (both earned Academy Award nominations for their roles) who play a mismatched pair that has to work together.  DiCaprio is Danny Archer, a white mercenary (who specializes in smuggling conflict diamonds to fund private wars) from Rhodesia (modern day Zimbabwe) who feels that by getting his hands on a rare \\"blood diamond\\" he will have enough money to leave Africa and retire.  This diamond has been found, but the only one who knows of its location is the man who found it: Solomon Vandy (Housou).  Vandy's son has been abducted by the guerrilla forces and after escaping slavery at the hands of the rebel group he meets Archer and makes an agreement that he will help him find the diamond, but only if he assists in rescuing his son.<br /><br />A wonderful film with the expert direction of Edward Zwick, Blood Diamond is a good film. I suppose my only gripe with the film would be its lack of concentration in regards to the conditions of Sierra Leone. Some things are just simply skimmed over, such as the issue of child soldiers, which I thought was one of the main issues the film was supposed to address. I don't know if this has to do with regulations on what you show children do on screen or what, but it definitely felt as if it was cut short.<br /><br />Regardless, this is a tight film that gets its message across while remaining an engaging, entertaining thriller. DiCaprio and Hounsou were at their very best in each scene.less, this is a tight film that gets its message across while remaining an engaging, entertaining thriller.

B0024FAR5W|5.0|Its like Sopranos with choppers.  If you like those kind of things, you'll love this series.    I had intended on watching these 1 episode at a time, because I had not watched it yet. I put disc 1 in (6 episodes) and watched them back to back right on thru to early morning hours. Great stuff! Hard to stop watching!
B0034JKZ86|4.0|All I can say is this: It's about time!  Once again the 2D animation department at Disney has completed a theatrical release.  Now, I may not be young, and I may not have children of my own, but I know as a fact that everyone can likely attest to how important Disney's animated musicals were to their childhood.  At the age of five the first film I ever saw in theaters WAS a Disney film.  I don't support the company for the most part, but I'll be darned if I don't expect quality from their 2D department.  The Princess and the Frog is a return to that warm-hearted spirit that made Disney great to begin with.  It isn't on par with The Lion King, Beauty & The Best, or Aladdin, but it is a real success.<br /><br />The story as most will know is based on the classic fairy tale, The Frog Prince...With a twist!  Our story begins with a wide-eyed dreamer by the name of Tiana, a young black girl whose mother works as the tailor for a wealthy - ...well, he looks like Colonel Sanders.  We then are taken from the mansion, through the streets of New Orleans, all the way to the shacks of the city's black community.  Here we are introduced to Tiana's daughter, a kind-face, hard-working man who looks like a cross between Denzel Washington and Barrack Obama.  Tiana dreams of opening a restaurant with her father...sadly, being in the classic Disney formula he has to die (presumably in World War I).<br /><br />In her twenties (or so I'd like to believe) Tiana (Anika Noni Ross) is working a harsh job still trying to save up for her father's restaurant.  When she's \\"almost there\\" she attends a ball where she meets a talking frog claiming to be the playboy Prince Naveen (Bruno Campos) who has had a bad run in with a voodoo witchdoctor.  Mistaking Tiana (who is borrowing a fine dress from her rich white friend and sporting a tiara for a costume party) for a princess Naveen encourages her to kiss him in order to make him human again.  The voodoo curse seems to backfire transforming Tiana into a frog.  Together, the two of them must hop into action to stop the evil witchdoctor before he condemns all the souls of New Orleans to his \\"friends on the other side\\" and become human again.<br /><br />There are many admirable traits about this new animated Disney feature, especially its leading...frog and frogger.  I love how this movie seems to possess a gender-role reversal as Naveen is the one being cursed Tiana is the hardworking hero.  Having a female lead in a Disney film that can actually fend for her is a great change of pace in their long line of helpless damsels in distress.  Now, I think its well worth that I have no idea who Anika Noni Ross is, but I'd be a fool not to note that she is one heck of a singer.  Her voice captures beauty in even the film's worst songs.  Bruno Campos lacks some singing talent, but his Naveen is very funny - think Peppy Le Pew only as a frog.<br /><br />Of course they're joined by a colorful cast.  Ray the lightning bug, Louis the trumpet playing alligator, etcetera.  As an adult viewer these characters had their moments, but they were clearly aimed at pleasing younger viewers.  By far my favorite of the supporting cast is Keith David as Dr. Facilier (or as the characters tend to call him: The Shadow Man).  This is just a cool villain, and given Disney's history of cartoon villains that's certainly says something.  His musical number of `Friends On The Other Side' was for me the highlight of the film.  Dark, intimidating animation and backgrounds merged with David's booming voice made for a really cool song that might even scare children when it goes into its final fifty seconds; the part where everything begins to burst into blazing lights and explosions to David's cry of \\"Are you ready!\\" before a skull mask appears on his face just above the jaw.  Just top notch stuff.<br /><br />My main complaints rest on the songs.  Aside from `Almost There' and the previously mentioned `Friends On The Other Side' most of the songs are pretty dull and uninspired.  Not to say they're bad, just that Disney has done so much better.<br /><br />The Princess and the Frog is great family entertainment!  ...though the title is misleading as she's not actually a princess...Probably should have stuck with `The Frog Prince' as the title, but I guess that wouldn't be able to sell as many dolls...Curse your profit making schemes, Disney!d.

B002WCLG3O|1.0|There has been written a lot already about Halo Legends in the comments, so I am trying to make it short: it was a really disappointing experience.     Most important: DO NOT BUY THE BLU-RAY if it costs more than the DVD. The graphics of most episodes are so basic, simple and even blurred, that you do not need HDTV-resolution to watch it nor benefit from paying for the extra pixels.     About the stories: sorry, but most of them are so simple, that I don't understand how people here can be even a little positive about them. I played Halo, Halo 2, Halo 3 and ODST and loved them all including the story. I read three of the Halo books, the others are waiting in the shelf to be read soon. So far I liked all of them. The stories are not the most complex or a re-invention of SciFi, but considered that this is a game we are talking about, they are definitey great and a fun experience. But this DVD? Sorry, but my little daughter could have written those storylines.     About the graphics: some animations of the stories were so basic, they were closer to a slideshow of still pictures than to being something worth of being called a cartoon. Plus the graphics were totally influenced by their japanese creators. The houses from the Elites looked like Japanese temples and the dress of the enemy in the third episode looked like a Japanese Samurai Warrior. That's not bad per se, but also not really creative and from good SciFi I expect a little more than a pure replication of our own world.    The only exception with respect to look&feel is the last episode \\"The Package\\". And now I know, why Microsoft used a part from that episode on the XBox as the advertisement for the DVD. ANY of the other episodes would just not have been convincing enough to be shown as an appetizer.    And yes, the whole stuff on the DVD reminds you totally of the Animatrix! The BIG difference being, that the Animatrix was a free extra on the regular movie DVD whereas you have to pay 25 US$ for this Blu-Ray or still over 16 US$ for the DVD of Halo Legends.    After seeing all 8 episodes I was asking myself \\"and when does the real thing start?\\". This is like a DVD full of bonus material but with the actual movie itself missing!    Sorry, but this time I feel really tricked by Bungie and Warner. Even if you are a fan of Halo, think twice before you waste your money and time on that. And don't think you would really miss any of the background information of the Halo Universe. Having fought against the Flood in any of the games should give you a good idea, why the Forerunners lost the battle in the end and had to built the Halo rings. Even worse, in the two Episodes Origins and Origins II they are showing, that the Forerunners had collected sample of the life of many planets in our galaxy to redeploy them after activating the Halo rings thus exterminating all and any life in the milky way. Funny enough, they \\"forgot\\" to include themselves in this Ark, so all life forms could be preserved and re-introduced on their planets, except the Forerunners. Sorry, but even humanity would not be so stupid to built an ark and then forget to put at least some humans into it. But a far more evolved species like the forerunners does forget themselves? Yeah, right!

0802798225|5.0|I first heard about this book because I saw a book called Rules Of Attraction and decided to check it out.   Perfect Chemistry is the first book in the Perfect Chemistry trilogy.   The book seamed interesting enough and I was obsessed with the trailer for Rules Of Attraction.   When I got this book, like I do all books, I sat down and didnt finish until I was done with the book.   It wasnt until I was done with it that I realize I was thirsty for more. I couldnt wait for Carlos's book.   Perfect Chemistry is for the ages 14 and up for a reason. Some younger kids might find things offensive or inappropriate.   Personally, I am in love with this book. I got it yesterday night and I've read it twice since then. Its that good.   You may not be interested in the book, some people just may not be. I say give it a try, if you dont like it, dont buy the second book. But, if you do you are going to go stir crazy for the next book.   Have fun!
B0036XN2L2|5.0|As a farewell, \\"Sting in the Tail\\" is an album the Scorpions and their fans can be proud of. One almost does a double take upon hearing the opening bars of \\"Raised on Rock\\". Rudolph Schenker's opening power chord riff and guitar tone sound like something from 1979's Lovedrive. When he's joined by Matthias Jabs on their trademark twin-guitar attack, and by Klaus Meine's instantly recognizable vocal, the effect is complete, the sound familiar, but fresh and not nostalgic.<br /><br />The songwriting here is characteristically tight, the arrangements and bridges are sophisticated, the production doesn't give in to modern clich&eacute;s, and the band comes off sounding like a renewed version of themselves.<br /><br />The band that vaulted to the top of the 1980s metal scene with its balance of rock anthems and infectious power ballads have decided to give it one last blast at what they do best. \\"Sting in the Tail\\" is reported to be the final Scorpions studio release. After the three-year mammoth tour, which will take them across five continents, one of the most successful rock bands in the world, will be ending their classic career that spanned over 4 decades.

B002XMGGK6|5.0|This movie is a great crime movie! The basic plot consists of Clyde Shelton (played by Gerard Butler) and his family being the victim of some thugs. Jaime Foxx plays Nick Rice, an Assistant DA who doesn't quite bring the thugs to justice as one gets let go after a deal was made in Nick Rice's favor. Clyde Shelton shows up after ten years, looking for vengeance in a wonderfully elaborate plot!<br /><br />The whole movie gives the feeling that there is a very complex and intricate preparation for Clyde Shelton's plot. However, you do not get to see much of the intricate details due to the movie following along with Nick Rice's view of things. You do not discover how this seemingly impossible game is taking place until Nick Rice discovers it. This leaves me wanting a bit more, but it would have likely detracted from the suspense and mystery in the movie if we had been given too much early on.<br /><br />This movie was well thought out. It could have been a bit more intense. I keep thinking of the background planning being almost similar to a Saw movie, where everything seems automated and foolproof. However, Saw movies tend to go into a bit more detail, and contain more complex setups. Even though there could have been a bit more effort into the revenge plans, it was still very enjoyable.<br /><br />This was indeed an excellent movie. If you like crime movies, with a good helping of mystery and suspense, and a \\"Law Abiding Citizen\\" getting back at the justice system for failing to do what is right, this movie is a good watch!
B000HA4W4S|4.0|I bought the two-disk set of \\"Ta-Dah\\" by The Scissor Sisters based on having heard just two songs, \\"Might Tell You Tonight,\\" and \\"I Don't Feel Like Dancin'.\\"  It turned out to be worth the gamble.  The Sisters channel the best of Elton John and the Bee Gees, creating a unique hybridized sound that is both cutting edge and discotheque.  While I've never been a big fan of the Saturday Night Fever falsetto, lead singer Jake Spears uses it to great effect on \\"Dancin',\\" \\"Ooo,\\" and \\"Paul McCartney.\\"  The Sisters somehow manage to create songs of great depth while being very danceable.  There are plenty of other songs that just drip with angst, a genuine emotionalism, without ever becoming a chore to the ear.  \\"Almost Sorry\\" is one of the best \\"F*** You\\" songs I've ever heard, and the achingly sweet \\"Might Tell You Tonight\\" perfectly captures the rapture of new love.  My only complaint is about the packaging, which is too clever by half.  The two-disk set opens up like a pair of elevator doors; good luck getting those doors closed again without damaging the box.  Still, if you're a fan of pre-\\"Let's Dance\\" David Bowie, Elton John, and some of the more adventurous tracks from Lou Reed's \\"Transformer,\\" I really think you'll enjoy this.

B0034JKZ3G|5.0|My 5 and 3 year old LOVED it!!  They got up and danced in the living room to the music and laughed like mad when the guys in the boat were beating each other up trying to get the frogs.  My husband and I even laughed at parts.  Yeah, the Voodoo theme is dark but they are actually being true to the tone of New Orleans, since Voodoo is nothing new down there and is actually a tourist attraction (you can Google this if you wish).  And guess what...my kids did not even MENTION anything about Voodoo.  Shadowman is just \\"the bad guy\\" according to my kids.  I loved the fact that it was a great theme for a kids' movie...\\"work hard and you will accomplish your dreams.\\"  This movie is set in, what looks like, 20's era New Orleans.  Tiana works as a waitress while saving up to open her own restaurant.  She is at a party one night, dressed up, and happens upon Prince Naveen (the frog).  He thinks she is a princess and asks her to kiss him in return for his financing her dream.  Since she is not a true princess, they are both turned into frogs.<br />This really was a cute movie and I miss hand drawn Disney movies!!!  I would love to see more done in the future.

I think that board books are generally over priced so the inclusion of the stuffed toy softens the sticker shock a bit.  The bunny isn't anything too special really, but as anyone with a toddler, or anyone who has ever bought a happy meal know, it needn't be.  The book itself, is a faithful reproduction of the original, in a sturdier form.  I am sure my daughter will enjoy eating it.  I am pleased with this purchase and cannot wait for Easter.

0596522347|4.0|Review: Slideology by Nancy Duarte<br />O'Reilly Publishing<br /><br />What gravitated me towards this book was the fact that it even existed.<br />Well that, and it's astonishingly well designed cover especially considering the subject matter - Slide Presentations.<br />\\"Finally!\\", I thought,<br />\\"Someone who gets it.\\"<br />It always amazed me that anything ever written by anyone on creating slide presentations with Powerpoint, Keynote or full-screen PDFs, was written by someone without any degree of formal design education and therefore completely devoid of any design sensibility. Usually they would run through the perfunctory getting-around-in-the-program elements and then they would culminate in how to make text spin as it entered into the screen. Hardly worthy of a read when presentations themselves have so much riding on them. Entire campaigns, careers or sales pitches worth millions of dollars often hang in the balance. Slideology provides a holistic approach to creating any sort of presentation, giving them the sort of respect and weight they rightfully deserve. The text allows you to elevate your thinking to the level of the communication specialists such as the authors - LA's Duarte Design Studios.<br />The Studio's founder reveals the thought processes necessary to effectively communicate your ideas in any sort of presentation.<br />It follows up the conceptual stuff with rock solid practical guidelines to ensure your content is not only highly effective but visually stunning.<br />Once people saw this book on my desk, it swept through our office like wildfire.

B002SJIO5E|5.0|The director says that \\"District 9\\" is primarily for entertainment, and should not be viewed as a political tract.    But it is political, and quite well done because it insinuates an interesting message without being preachy.    That's because nothing is stated, and everything is dramatized.  You are forced to draw your own conclusions.    The main message is: prejudice is deep and almost intractable.  But this message is not immediately apparent because the aliens are deliberately creepy-looking and apparently vicious.    In short, in Effective Prejudice style, the \\"other\\" is instantly dehumanized, and so it is easy to feel scared and defensive about them.    But the rest of the movie humanizes the aliens, and de-humanizes the humans (quite literally in the case of the hero).    By the end, you are rooting for the aliens and for the poor hero who realizes his own salvation depends on them, and against the paranoid and trigger-happy humans.    The documentary style is flawless and jittery and involving.    For U.S. viewers (like me), this apparent you-are-there realism is made stronger by the fact that all the actors are South African and to me unknown--they seem like actual people going through actual, unpredictable events.    Superb.
B002VECMAO|3.0|2.8 stars<br /><br />This could have been SUCH a great movie! The subject screams comedy but there are precious few laughs in Goats. Some reviewers on this site call it \\"hilarious\\", but we didn't laugh out loud once, and chuckled only on occasion. Clooney's is the sole funny performance here, and even he couldn't make this exceptionally uninteresting script take flight.<br /><br />McGregor is almost surrealistically boring; his voice-over is pablum. Ronson's book might be good (haven't read it) but the adaptation is almost a textbook case of how to make a movie boring. The script didn't make me care about one single character, didn't deliver any deep laughs, and basically just told the story with no depth or flair. A subject this good has so many possibilities but almost none of them are explored with any grace here. Director Heslov seemed content to make the whole movie as dry as possible, and it sure got boring fast; we had to force ourselves to watch the end in hope of some payoff. Wishful thinking.<br /><br />It's funny that almost every review on this site, from one star to five, is getting plenty of negative votes, suggesting that there's no agreement from the audience about this movie. No wonder. It just kinda leaves you scratching your head in many ways. Such a fine cast, but even Spacey and Bridges bring no real uplift to the proceedings. It did look good in blu-ray, but there isn't enough beauty here to really make the hi-def that necessary. The extras are ok; actually, the documentary about the real-life psy-ops program is probably the best thing on this whole disc, all told.<br /><br />But when weak jokes about Jedis delivered by \\"Jedi\\" McGregor (is that the best they can do?) are among the comedy highlights, you know this baby ain't firing on all cylinders. Only Clooney made this worth watching for me, as he brings some elan to his role that no one else in the movie seemed able to muster.<br /><br />The dvd box text claims this is like a Coen Brothers movie; I can only imagine how much more fun they would have brought to the table with this subject. Sadly, Heslov is no Coen, and this movie is miles from that standard of humor and filmmaking.<br />It's competent, but when that's the best compliment one can muster, oh well.<br /><br />Perhaps this movie would work best via remote viewing.un they would have brought to the table with this subject.

0545123267|2.0|I was hoping that this book might be the next \\"Twilight,\\" but it's definitely not. I will admit that I like the \\"Twilight\\" books, despite the fact that the plots are ridiculous and the conflicts are resolved far too easily. The characters, however, are delightful. \\"Shiver\\" attempts to capture the same audience as \\"Twilight,\\" but the characters aren't even close to as compelling as Bella and Edward. The plot, like \\"Twilight,\\" is thin. But where Stephanie Meyer succeeds -- building the characters, their relationship, and the suspense of getting them into bed -- Stiefvater fails miserably. There's very little suspense, and honestly, I only finished reading the book because I felt obligated. I could get sucked into \\"Twilight\\" and read one of those books in two days, but it took me two weeks to force myself through \\"Shiver.\\" It was boring, and the resolution was contrived. I would not recommend it, even to young readers.

This author who teaches at the University of Memphis answers no as she details the 60-year story of Henrietta Lacks, a poor southern tobacco farmer whose cells were harvested by modern medicine without her knowledge or consent and became the first \\"immortal\\" human cells used in medical research.  Today there are more than 50 million tons of her cells used in multi billion dollar cancer, virus, polio, cloning, and in vitro fertilization investigations and Lacks and !her family never saw a dime.  An outstanding book about a terrible secret
B001NPJGL0|5.0|This is a very handy product.  I am a beginner astronomer, and I bought this device to help set up my telescope.  The magnetic strip on the was helpful in holding the level in place so I could level my scope.  Once I was satisfied with the leveling, the angle gauge work like a charm in getting me to the right altitude.  The dial on my telescope is so small that it was difficult to tell with any certainty, that I was correctly aligned. The DigiPas has made the set up of the telescope so much easier.  I've not used it for much else, but I'm sure if the need arises, this product will work well.

B002ZTQVGQ|5.0|This movie, though not the best of Miyazaki's, is very interesting.  It reminds you of being in a dream.  The mother of the boy, Sosuki, is very courageous.  Sosuki is a very positive, honest child.  They both meet their challenges with enthusiasm.    The story is NOT predictable between the beginning, where Sosuki finds the fish, and the end, where Ponyo and Sosuki accomplish their goal, and is full of some very fantastical surprises.  There is only a trace of \\"The Little Mermaid\\" theme to it.    For most of the movie you really don't know whether Ponyo's father is the villain or not.  The many other characters in the movie round out this dream quite well, especially the old ladies.  Sosuke's father has some charm, too, and Ponyo's mother tops it off amazingly.  All in all Ponyo is a very enjoyable movie for young and old alike.
B000OPOAM0|1.0|Why in the hell would they release this copy of Terminator without any bonus material if they released one 6 years ago with bonus material. My way of thinking was to buy the most resent copy that has come out, which in a world with logic and common sense would be the superior copy. I would be wrong. Its my fault for not being more thorough with my search, but its still doesn't make sense that they would downgrade the newest release of the DVD. Oh well. Its still a great movie regardless.
B001C4CI8U|5.0|The person who described this show as \\"smart and stylish\\" knew what they were talking about.  Fringe is smart and stylish because of the actress Anna Torv. She wears a very stylish and sexy black leather coat in the episode \\"Bound\\" as an FBI agent, acting mean/looking nice type woman, those are the type of women I like in movies and TV shows. Anna Torv is just plain smooth.
B000PKX2KA|5.0|This item works great!  It does exactly what it should and what it is advertised to do.  Any reviewer who says otherwise is off his rocker, or is under 12!    This is worth the price, and it is a GOOD price.  You won't be unsatisfied with this product unless you don't know what it is.
B00005O438|4.0|I really wanted to share this movie with my son, who likes scary flicks. For those who like this sort of thing, this is campy and fun.  Don't take it too seriously or you will be disappointed.  The dog looks like he is smeared with candlewax, and there is some bad acting.  There are a couple of really good scary moments, especially when they are in the car and the dog decides he doesn't like Pintos (who does?).  If you want a really good story, read the book, which is infinitely better.  But if you have a 12 year old boy, watch this together on a rainy Friday night, popcorn in hand, when you want to have a little fun family fright night.
0452289963|5.0|This book is one of the most important books ever written.  Eckhart Tolle has provided a useful guide to understanding your own ego-based conditioned mind and freeing yourself from the tyranny of this mind.  His words are astonishingly simple and clear; and his examples make it real.  I have read hundreds of books that point to this truth by other authors; but never before has anyone made it so straightforward and concrete.  This is a must read!

B002QY9RMA|5.0|I absolutely am Beyonce's biggest fan.  I love this girl and everything aboout her.  I bought my initial album from Best Buy.  I have a guy friend that was interested in listening so I made sure that I bought it for him.  I also bought another copy for my mother.  She is just brilliant all the way round if you're asking for my opinion.  Her songs you can relate to if you just listen to the words. Her voice is just so angelic and perfect.  I love Miss Beyonce and I will stand to the highest mountain and tell anybody.  Everybody that knows me knows that she is MY girl and I would purchase anything that she does because its a guarantee that it will be good, with no question.  Thanks Amazon.com
B0015KG3N2|4.0|Years ago, I read this book as it made the rounds among my college friends; it was insightful, soothing & inspiration to us all.  I recently re-read this...I had been getting caught up in life's daily race & was needing a comforting, centering & easy read.  This book still possesses the positive & happy charms that delighted me long ago!  I appreciate how Hoff illustrates Taoism through Winnie the Pooh anecdotes... some of the Pooh moments so heartwarmingly illustrate life's everyday beauty that I find myself getting misty w/ emotion appreciating everyday beauty.   I must agree w/ previous viewers, though, in objecting to the book's portrayal of Buddhists as bitter sufferers, I subscribe to much Buddhist thought & feels this in an inaccurate & unfair portrayal. And as other reviewers mentioned, I think the book's points could have been made without insulting scientists, busy people, other religions, etc.  But in the spirit of the book, I see past these aspects to take in all the good that remains.  This book is chock-full of gems & anecdotes that help buoy my day!

I could never imagine that someone lives this kind of live nor how they survive it. Very touching performances from the Monique and the new actress. It allowed me to watch Monique's transformation as an actress rival that of Denzel in TRAINING DAY. Fantastic treatment of the film and screenwriting. Not to be missed; but difinitely difficult to watch.

B003196ZO2|5.0|I really enjoyed this movie for all it had to offer.      Many others have elaborated here, so no sense repeating the details.   One thing I will point out is that, if you pay attention, you can pick up on a certain tension between Michael and the Producer. It's evident, and it makes me ponder the types of pressures Michael was under during the rehearsals and planning stages.    There will never been another Michael Jackson.  This is it.

0399226907|4.0|As a volunteer, I read one-on-one to preschool children at a Head Start school two days per week.  I recently read this book for the first time, when it ended up in the bag of books I must choose from when I read.  I VERY quickly found out that it is a very special book!  Child after child in both my afternoon and morning classes chose this book when it was one of the selected books of the day.<br /><br />Kids in my classes tend to go for the board books, especially the younger ones.  This board book is unique in that it has these little partial pages that stack on one another, which I thought was quite clever.  It is a small book, just the right size for a small child's hands, and very sturdy.<br /><br />My only criticism (and the reason I gave the book 4 stars vs. 5) is that, after the hungry caterpillar eats through all these foods in one week, he is called \\"a big fat caterpillar.\\"  I think it would have sufficed to say that he was no longer a tiny caterpillar or that he had grown up, rather than to say he was big and fat.  While I don't have many obese children in my classes, I don't think it would be a positive thing to read to an obese child that the caterpillar was big and fat.<br /><br />All in all, though, a fun story and a nicely-done board book.
0061733199|5.0|I haven't had much of a need for this info in the past (I have camped a few times, though), but I have often wondered what I would do in an emergency away-from-society situation. By God's grace I will never be in one, but I still find this a fascinating and enjoyable read. The information is clearly useful and practical. After watching a few episodes of Survivorman and Man vs. Wild on Netflix, though, the initial glory and excitement of being in a situation like this has diminished for me. I think now it also may be worthwhile to spend more time learning about more currently-useful part-of-society 'survival' topics that can certainly positively affect my life and others now like: how to build a good marriage, love my wife and kids, communicate better with others, improve my work-related skills, love God and pray better to God (that the emergency/survival situations in this book won't happen, for example), etc. However, I admittedly feel better knowing this information. I actually now have an emergency/survival kit in my car (Bought one cheap online: 'Essentials 2 Person Survival Kit' by Guardian: contains some long-lasting food, emergency blankets, lights, other). Recommended. :-)

B00012FXAE|5.0|You can't get any better than this. Cameron knew exactly what he was doing, and he made a masterpiece. I love Alien, but this film blows it away. The Queen is such an amazing addition to the series, and of course, the Colonial Marines. Hicks, Hudson, Vasquez, Drake... they're all such incredible characters, and you remember all of them. The cast is phenomenal. Sigourney Weaver is so intense while Bill Paxton nearly steals the show when he should've been annoying as hell, and Michael Biehn gives every scene weight. Everybody plays their roles just right. The effects are top notch, the dialogue is great and memorable, the directing is clean and clear, and the music is brilliant.
B002VPE1AW|1.0|this movie only made so much money because each ticket is $15.  the special effects are incredibly over hyped its sickening.  i didnt see anything new about it, other than jim cameron painting his people in his movie blue & wearing indian wear.  cameron needs to stop making movies- his suck.  oh, and they arent even his- he steals all of the stories.  to ruin the movie in one sentence - 'dances with Pocahontas'
B002VKE0XA|4.0|I really enjoyed this movie. For a no-budget picture, the filmmaker was extremely clever and understood that sometimes what you don't see is more terrifying than anything you could show. It's all about atmosphere... the little sounds in the night, lights flickering on and off, sheets being pulled away, shadows in the doorway, etc. This movie isn't all smoke and mirrors though. They do show you things but just enough to creep you out. I liked the characters too, and the acting is very believable.<br /><br />I'd definitely recommend it if you like old school haunted house movies or psychological horror. When this movie isn't outright scaring you, it's building up to it. It's very effective and worth owning.
B002S0OBMS|5.0|I had the wonderful fortune to view this production in London one week after its premier. The CD captures all the beauty of this stage production. I'm not sure what others expected when listening to this album. If it had been a rehash of the same plot, or the characterizations had been the same, critics would have trashed it for not being original. I found the plot very sensible and the music absolutely divine. In fact I've been addicted to the CD since my return from Europe. Die hard ALW fans will find tiny snippets of musical motifs from previous shows such as Sunset Blvd., Starlight Express, and even Cats. Mind you, he does not rehash old songs in this production, but there are chord progressions that are recognizable to the trained ear. The duet of Christine & Gustave is particularly enjoyable to listen to, and reminded me of the Pie Jesu from Requiem. There are times when you think it will launch into the original's title music and then just leave you hanging with a brand new melody. This musical is not a fast paced or action packed swash buckler, but plays into the original character of the phantom being an illusionist. The psychology of the show is unmistakeable as Raoul sings of the mask he wears that hides the horrible person inside that he's become, while the Phantom sings of the beauty underneath. LND is refreshing in that we are treated to many original tunes rather than pulling out a collection of pop hits like so many recent shows have done. Sir Webber, I salute you and am still a huge fan!! Thank you for bringing this show to life. Someday, maybe the critics will find the beauty underneath.
B0035V35PI|2.0|I wish this movie would've used less CG blood and focused more on the ninja clans as opposed to the Interpol investigation, but I thought it was pretty good. The action could've been more clear at times, but Rain carried the movie well, and Shô Kosugi was perfect... I actually wish the film was all about him. Overall, I enjoyed it, but I wouldn't own it.<br /><br />Should you buy this? Do you like ninja movies? Bloody action? If so, go for it. If you're expecting a perfect film, don't. It is entertaining, but it's not anywhere near as good as V for Vendetta (the director's other work).

I love this album, I know it's a little over produced in spots which is why I give it the 4.5 instead of 5 stars but that is what they were going for, an album full of hits.  Women is my favorite song on the album.  I remember the first time hearing Women sitting in a movie theater waiting for a show to start when the single was released and absolutely loving it.  Looking back now the album is a little dated but in its moment it was as good as anything there was.

B0037AGASG|3.0|The first step to accepting Justin Bieber is getting past his age. It's everywhere on this record, impossible to ignore, and, frankly, if Bieber was simply a twenty-something white boy with an R&B fetish, My World 2.0 would be easy to acknowledge as a disposable adult contemporary record in the vein of latter-day Backstreet Boys. But Bieber is just following in the proud tradition of plenty of vapid pop stars before him, from the Mickey Mouse club to Miley Cyrus, and although his voice stubbornly refuses to conjure up images of anyone older than thirteen, it would be shortsighted and irresponsible to write off Bieber as a flash in the pan novelty.<br /><br />The problems at the heart of My World 2.0, actually, have little to do with Bieber's talent. For the most part, his production team, featuring ubiquitous and fairly anonymous hitmakers like The-Dream and The Stereotypes, do him little favors here. Too often Bieber is saddled with the kind of bland, by-the-numbers ballads like \\"Overboard\\" and \\"Up\\" that come off as duplicates of every other R&B slow jam out there, except sung by someone who can't have much experience in what he's singing about. Of course, therein lies the other major problem that undermines much of My World 2.0 - I'll be damned if Bieber is an expert in heartbreak, love, or any other of the sentiments he expresses in either his teenage lothario role (\\"Baby,\\" \\"Runaway Love,\\" \\"Stuck In The Moment,\\") or his grief-stricken dumpee role (uh, \\"That Should Be Me\\" - Bieber's a pretty optimistic guy, for the most part, making that particular song a contrived disaster). It's hard to take the majority of the lyrics seriously, so when Bieber croons \\"so give me the night / to show you, hold you\\" shortly followed by a chorus that goes \\"shorty is an eenie meenie miney mo lover,\\" it's not only disturbing, but unintentionally hilarious. There's not much to say about the kind of producer who thinks the use of the term \\"shorty\\" with an elementary school gimmick is a good idea.<br /><br />Nearly every song requires some sort of suspension of belief thanks to the lyrics, but if one ignores just what bull**** Bieber is spewing at any given time, My World 2.0 reveals itself as a largely unobjectionable slice of harmless pop music. In fact, Bieber's voice is the least offensive thing here; dude can sing. His decision to be more \\"edgy,\\" what with the more R&B bent compared to his debut and Ludacris and Sean Kingston guest spots, occasionally pays some worthwhile dividends, particularly the bumping \\"Somebody To Love\\" and the surprisingly enjoyable piano-based rhythm of \\"Never Let You Go.\\" It's noteworthy that the tracks that suffer the most rarely fail due on account of Bieber - even on the sappiest, cheesiest ballad, Bieber is genuinely pleasant to listen to, although the waves of hackneyed production and banal lyrics will turn off all but the most dedicated pop fan.<br /><br />Despite Bieber's rather poor reputation outside of his prepubescent teenage girl demographic and the commercial stench the album gives off (Bieber on why he's released his debut in two parts: \\"people do not want to wait over a year and a half for new music;\\" surely the record company had no say in this), My World 2.0 is effective and innocent Top 40 material, if not terribly inventive. It won't do much to quiet the haters, but if Bieber gets some quality material and reaches that inevitable \\"I'm coming out as a mature artist\\"-stage, he might establish himself as an enduring pop star. If not, I'm sure there's a lucrative future in bat mitzvah gigs for the Bieb.ea.

0451228731|5.0|The book does not start with a big enough bang to get you hooked,but it is worth getting through the first few chapters as it only gets better. I ended up desperate for the next instalment as the finish is a huge question mark. What is so compelling is that the situation seems plausible. These multi player games do have people hooked and a powerful 'meme' could indeed take over these games and move them into the real world. I need to know how the Daemon will play out as it takes over the world, over corporations and politicians and banks. It is telling that real life is not as fun as the game becomes for the participants in the Daemon's scheme - perhaps this is true of many people's lives. I am not a gamer but I still found this fascinating. A definitely buy for a fast thrilling read.

B00275EGWY|1.0|Anyone who says this movie is great, awesome, and the best movie of 09, why dont you go to Iraq and see what they really do!  I was in Iraq for 15 months and saw EOD dawn the suit one time, the suit is a last resort.  EOD does NOT go out by themselves!  They have this magical thing called EOD escort who is usually a Infantry Platoon like myself.<br /><br />I really would like to know who they are basing this off of or getting there information from?!  Normally I wouldnt have said anything but seeing some of these people's responses to this movie has triggered something.  This is a great movie for the POG's who never leave the FOB, PB or whatever else.  Gives them something to watch, and say they have seen it all.<br /><br />You want to know the truth of it all?  A unit finds a IED, they call it up to the higher command, they then contact the EOD escort and they roll, they find the IED which usually is a god damn bush in the road, they either send jonny5 (robot) or they do a drivebye, and guess whats next, the easiest thing, they BLOW IT!!  So i hate to break it to all you fools out there, their is no gerber tooling of the ied's, no walking up and pulling on wires, no chasing down haji, none of it, you were all taken by this hollywood monster.<br /><br />In my opinion the last good war movie is saving private ryan.  With all the wishy washy directors out there today i dont think we will ever see a true war film, something that shows what the US troops are really going through, not this bull!  If you want to see something that comes close to the war in Iraq why dont you go out and rent the Generation kill series, this is gritty and what its really like to be there.

B002PEP4SC|3.0|As a fan of ABC's popular Monday night dramady CASTLE, I was really looking forward to the publication of HEAT WAVE.  I thought that ABC's plan to publish the Nikki Heat series of books by fictional author Richard Castle was inspired and a really great tie-in.  Unfortunately, the resulting incarnation of HEAT WAVE leaves me cold.<br /><br />To explain HEAT WAVE, you have to understand the TV series CASTLE.  CASTLE is the story of Richard Castle, a famous crime novelist with 26 bestsellers to his name.  In the first season of CASTLE, we learn that after 26 wildly popular books, Castle has killed off his well beloved main character and is looking for new inspiration.  He finds that inspiration in NYPD detective Kate Beckett.  Kate Beckett is smart, streetwise, and sexy, and she solves murders that others can't.  Beckett really can't stand the wisecracking Castle who drops famous names at the drop of a hat, but finds him surprisingly helpful in solving crimes.  It seems that mystery writers spend a great deal of time thinking about murder.<br /><br />The above is also an apt description of Richard Castle's new novel HEAT WAVE.  Just change a few minor details:  Jameson Rook is a reporter, looking to do an in-depth story on a NYPD detective squad, Nikki Heat, head of the unit, is smart, streetwise, and sexy, Nikki resents Rook at first, but finds him surprisingly helpful, etc.<br /><br />The problem comes as you continue the comparison.  Where CASTLE, the TV series is funny, well-written, clever, and polished, HEAT WAVE is juvenile, plodding, and very rough.  Richard Castle (portrayed brilliantly by Nathan Fillion) has written 26 international bestsellers, won numerous literary awards, and is a man of the world - suave, sexy, and accomplished.  I just can't suspend my disbelief enough to believe that he wrote HEAT WAVE.  HEAT WAVE reads more like a first novel and an amateurish one at best.  A Richard Castle novel should sing, should envelop and transport the reader, and should keep the reader in suspense.  HEAT WAVE misses the mark on all points.  We know Richard Castle; we know what his books should be like.  HEAT WAVE isn't it.<br /><br />There is potential here, and I do hope that ABC tries again with another Nikki Heat novel.  But please, find a writer who can at least make us believe that he is Richard Castle.  Because we do want to believe.in suspense.  HEAT WAVE misses the mark on all points.

030745455X|5.0|Whew! I feel like I just came off of a wild ride at the amusement park! I inhaled The Girl Who Played With Fire. In this second book of his Millenium series we discover more about Lisbeth Salandar's past, including government conspiracies, parents, and just a hint more about her sister.  I absolutely adore Lisbeth Salandar's character! She is damaged but her spirit prevails.  In The Girl Who Played With Fire a sex trafficking ring is discovered that reaches all the way to the top of Sweden's government and most profitable businesses.  From the first paragraph I was totally hooked!<br /><br />  \\"She lay on her back fastened by leather straps to a narrow bed with a steel frame. The harness was tight across her rib cage. Her hands were manacled to the sides of the bed.\\"<br /><br />From there I was gone....reading the book all night long! I'm going to have to read both of these over again because I'm sure I missed key elements just because I could not wait to turn the page to see what happened next.  The things you discover in this latest book about Lisbeth's past will shock you, horrify you and make you appreciate the family you do have. It's that real!  All I can say is May is too far away to wait on The Girl Who Kicked The Hornet's Nest!
076790382X|5.0|I love this book. It is the funniest book in my large library of good reads. I have read it over and over, and every time, it makes me laugh until I cry. I laughed so hard while reading it on an airplane one time, that the women in front of me turned around and told me to \\"shush!\\" From commentaries on how to totally fail at ordering gourmet in restaurants, to the stumbling, bumbling attempts we all make to fix our computers, get a decent hair cut, or even have a little fun with chop sticks and the garbage disposal, anyone needing a bit of joy in their lives should read this book, or at least keep it handy...just in case.
0307454541|5.0|Do you like fiction? Better yet, do you like a good mystery? One that grabs you from the very first sentence and makes you hold your breath throughout until the last word?  I recently read one of those.  And if you are a mystery lover then you know those kind of books are few and far between.  I had seen The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo by Stieg Larsson in the bookstores, online, just about everywhere but had resisted the urge to pick it up for some reason.  When I finally gave in to all of the hype about the book, I was so glad I did.  I could not believe a flawed hero and kick-ass heroine with too many problems to count could become the greatest crime-solving team in recent history.  I have been telling everyone I know to RUN, don't walk, to get this book.<br /><br />So after I read Mr. Larsson's first book in what is called the \\"Millenium Trilogy\\" I had to know more about this author. I wanted to read everything I could get my hands on of his.  Unfortunately, he passed away of a sudden heart attack in 2004.  His whole trilogy is being published posthumously.  Not only did I discover he was from Sweden, but he was the chief editor of Expo, an anti-fascist magazine published in Sweden.  His life reads like a James Bond movie; it's no wonder he could write Lisbeth Salandar's character with so much life!

B0039UTDFG|1.0|OK, I am a Brit (English) currently living in the USA, and do not get me wrong by what I say in the following review, it is my choice and I love it - or so my wife tells me. She hails from MD and lived in the UK for a number of years. If I had even suggested to her that I buy the Sigourney Weaver narrated version of Planet Earth, I would have been severely beaten around the head. Whilst she does have issues with Ms. Weaver (something to do with a previous male friend having some form of fascination for white female underwear (Alien) - I see no problem with that) but her belief is that the definitive version is narrated by David Attenborough. I am also in full agreement with that view - David Attenborough, as has been quoted by many previous viewers, is the definitive voice of natural history.    Having said all that, I have not yet seen \\"Life\\" and of course when I do I will be watching it on Blu-ray, narrated by David Attenborough, there is no question about it. Many TV programmes from the UK have made it across \\"the pond\\" and have been extremely successful in their original form as well as the version modified for the US market - take \\"The Office\\" as an example. However, for the BBC Natural History series, who actually needs/wants a US English version? No doubt time will tell if the actual sales figures are made available.    Phil
0307463745|5.0|Jason Fried and David Hansson have a lot of unconventional business wisdom to share. This book is essentially a collection of pithy business proverbs, each of which is elaborated over one to three pages. The writing style is blunt and opinionated, and this helps to make the content easy to understand and fun to read. This is not so much a manual for running a business as a collection of well-thought-out ideas for challenging prevailing business preconceptions.<br /><br />What are the essential ingredients of a successful business? The authors advocate a small and lean style of business: keep the number of employees to a minimum, only hire when you absolutely have to, keep your products simple and minimalistic, minimise the money you spend on office space, advertising, accounting, stationery, IT and similar items, and avoid embracing complexity just to keep key customers happy.<br /><br />The book explains the distinctive culture of the authors' own business, 37signals, which has achieved enormous commercial success while operating on very different principles from those used by competitor businesses. Many who run businesses will disagree with at least some of the advice offered, but everyone involved in business management will benefit from considering the challenges thrown out on every page of this highly engaging book.
0375831975|3.0|We were looking for the 40th anniversary addition, but that was not what we received.<br />We love this book (one of our daughters already has it and we were looking to get another copy for our other daughter).<br />This book is awesome and I wish it was actually available (hard to find and iffy as to whether it can still be gotten. Just as we thought we had located a copy it turned out not to be the right one). There might be one out there, we did not have the time to wait as our second daughter was needing it for a school project. So for those that can track down the real copy, get it (and congratulations on finding it).<br />Even though we had the ISBN number which was posted that was not the ISBN numbered book we received.<br />Book Great, listing in Amazon and seller poor.<br />That is why the rating of 3.
B001ECQ4HG|5.0|Watching this again reminded me why Quentin Tarantino is brilliant.  The dialogue in this movie is some of his best.  The movie looks great and holds up well.
B00000I41J|5.0|I am a lover of Jazz and Cannonball. I think that, aside from kind of blue, this is one of the greatest albums Cannonball ever recorded. The other players are fantastic as well. The legendary Miles Davis, and Art Blakey. Autumn Leaves is especially good, although unusual in style. I would recommend this album to anyone who loves Jazz, and is looking to expand their listening collection. Somethin' Else...need I say anymore?
B0018PH3L0|5.0|Once in a while a film or miniseries comes along that so exceeds the usual standards for such work as to be unforgettable. Larry McMurtry's towering, Pulitzer Prize-winning novel, \\"Lonesome Dove\\" has inspired just such a monumental epic film/miniseries. I had already read the book when the film came out, and was looking forward to watching, while prepared to be a bit disappointed. Film adaptations are often somewhat of a letdown. Well, I laughed, I cried, I was deeply moved, I was awed. What I was NOT was disappointed on any level. the characters are believable and either very scary or very lovable, especially Robert Duvall's \\"Augustus\\". Casting was across the board nearly perfect. Acting performances were superior, the music soundtrack was evocative. Direction, storyline, props, costuming, scene staging... EVERYTHING was superior. I recommend this masterpiece in the highest possible terms- watch it as soon as possible. I doubt you'll regret it.
B001TH16DI|5.0|As a long time Trekkie I'd love to be able to watch and review this product but I have never received this item even though the vendor has taken my money.  No responses to three requests for information...I finally had to open a claim with Amazon.  My review is - at all costs - do NOT purchase any merchandise from the vendor Movies28!!!
B0000E6XH3|5.0|I purchased this DVD after YEARS of knowing about it - one of those situations where I kept saying \\"I'll get around to it\\". I was already a huge fan of the Discovery album, but I still never got around to getting this DVD.     I finally got it, and I was very happy with it!       I knew the Discovery album by heart, and I had already seen the first four tracks/videos before - just a hint of the story line. The full length film has a lot to it - cheesy 70's-inspired animation, comedy, drama, etc all wrapped up in a blanket of great dance music.       If you are a fan of Discovery, you will find yourself singing along to the songs as you watch the movie. It's a fun, entertaining film that you can watch without taking too seriously. The only downside is that I wish there were more special features, but all in all I'm really happy with this video!
0805091742|5.0|The KISS principle states that simplicity should be a key goal in design, and that unnecessary complexity should be avoided.  When translated, KISS stands for \\"keep it short and simple.\\"  There are few authors today that are willing to tell the truth and be objective, while still maintaining credibility.  I would like to address Atul Gawande's most recent entry and classic, \\"The Checklist Manifesto: How To Get Things Right.\\"      Gawande is also the author of Better and Complications, a general and endocrine surgeon at the Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston, a staff writer for The New Yorker, an associate professor at Harvard Medical School and the Harvard School of Public Health, and leads the World Health Organization's Safe Surgery Saves Lives program. Quite an impressive resume Mr. Gawande has there; however, his ego never gets to him.  His \\"down-to-earth\\" approach to the implementation of checklists is wholly inspirational.  In The Checklist Manifesto, Gawande attempts to redefine society's mentality through his ability to write cleverly and eloquently while being objective and straight to the point.  He supports his in-depth research and provides a variety of careers and fields where a simple checklist can be implemented.  In fact, it works.    Gawande establishes his cleverness and objectiveness early in the The Checklist Manifesto.  He talks about a true story of how an anesthesiologist used the wrong concentration of potassium that he'd intended.  In fact, the anesthesiologist used \\"a concentration one hundred times higher\\" (Gawande 6).  The team did everything they could to try to stabilize the patient: \\"The surgical team was so shaken they weren't sure they could finish the operation.  They'd not only nearly killed the man but also failed to recognize how.  They did finish the procedure though\\" (Gawande 7).  Now, you may be sitting there thinking \\"Why would it matter if they made a mistake?  As long as the surgical team was able to save the patient, then it shouldn't matter, right?\\"  Let me ask you this question: \\"Are we to rely on luck over and over again?\\"  This was just one patient and a simple mistake almost killed the patient.  By spending a few seconds (or even minutes) looking over and using a checklist, you can substantially minimize potential mistakes. Gawande also tells the reader of an instance in aviation where a Delta Air Lines flight from Shanghai to Atlanta with 247 people aboard almost crashed on November 26, 2008.  The engine failed because of icy conditions.  The pilot and copilot \\"got out their checklist and followed the lessons it offered\\" (Gawande 135).  Because of what they did, the engine recovered and all 247 people were saved.      \\"If you were having an operation, would you want the checklist to be used?  A full 93 percent said yes\\" (Gawande 157).  This was a survey taken by medical professionals.  Gawande is consistent in being clever throughout The Checklist Manifesto and never loses his focus on the importance of checklists.  Gawande is able to capture medicine in all of its complex and chaotic glory.  He inspires all of us, doctor or not, to lose our ego, implement a simple checklist, and be better.  Less is more.  Keep it simple.     I highly recommend The Checklist Manifesto by Atul Gawande to any reader because it can apply to the lives of just about anyone.    Gene

B001UJUGZO|5.0|I have been a fan of Sarah Michelle Gellar since Buffy.  This movie is another great performance.  It is also strange to see the pie maker from Pushing Daisies as a bad person.  It was a thoroughly enjoyable movie.
B0039NJTLQ|4.0|My intentions in watching this film were to watch a racy subject- a widowed wife sleeping with her husband's brother, but this film is more powerful than what the previews alluded to. This film captures the very dark and delicate side of the transitions families go through during deployments and war. This movie is not \\"another war movie,\\" it's about humanity and life. The story line demonstrates that the ways that we cope are not always right and pieces never really fit back together, but that's human nature and a part of living. The casting was perfect and I was uncomfortable by the realism between the characters. To cover such a controversial topic, the balance between truth and respect must be carefully addressed to the audience, and the director and the characters of this movie have done just that.     An excellent, but sad film.
B00005MP58|5.0|I wasn't too sure about how much I really enjoyed this version of Pride and Prejudice and watched it at the same time as a shorter version that I really did like and one that my daughter already had. Well, to my amazement, I found that I truly began to like this version and realize that it had some great merits to it. I am just beginning to be a Jane Austen fan, once I gave a 5 volume set to my daughter, and found that I really enjoy the movies. I have always loved period pieces since I was a child, ones that were true to the time period in speech, clothing and the story line. So I began to watch very closely and found myself lost in the story again truly enjoying another time period in history. I would certainly recommend it to anyone who enjoys good behavior, historical costuming, old fashioned manners and etiquette and an intriguing story line between men and women. My teenage daughter and I love to watch when all the other \\"men\\" in our house are away and we can spend some hours together! We both recommend it for all those romantic hearts who love to immerse themselves in human relationships!
B002YIHO7I|3.0|Not as good as I hoped! I don't think it will be a classic album and I hope we don't have to wait another ten years. For some real sade. This not her best work.
B002E2M5IC|5.0|I couldn't love this movie more.  It is one of my favorite Cohen Brothers films.  A SERIOUS MAN is patient, hilarious, sharp and honest, it questions the meaning of existence but seems to offer an answer as well, in a similar way that THE BIG LABOWSKI does.  Like the Dude the protagonist, Larry Gopnick is encouraged by others to seek answers and take himself seriously which only makes Larry more frustrated.  Larry tells the Rabbi's receptionist \\"I am a..serious man\\" when he is exactly the opposite.  This mirrors the Dude when he gets irate (very \\"un-dude\\") and quotes George Bush Sr by saying, \\"this act of aggression will not stand...\\"  Maybe the Cohen brothers are suggesting that it should be enough to trust one's morals and seek life's meaning there and not get corrupted by an absurd society full of grudges, expectations and superstitions.  As they say in Labowski \\"the dude abides.\\"  and in a Serious Man, the Rabbi says \\"be a good boy.\\"    In this film, the Cohen brothers have fun showing the absurdity of everything from math, law to religious ritual.  There is a sort of meaninglessness behind it all, in so far that the meaning fails to connect with the characters involved.  But there is also a tenderness and affection that Ethan and Joel have for their characters as well - more so than in BURN AFTER READING or NO COUNTRY FOR OLD MEN.    For the detractors...  I pity those who think this film is stupid or a waste of time - you're missing out.    PS.  The blu-ray looks exquisite.  Boy, is that midwestern blue sky blue!!!
B002SEW5WW|5.0|I definitely recommend One Republic's new album, Waking Up. It's a whole new sound for them that totally works! So glad they took the risk! Buy it as soon as you can, you wont be disappointed... I listen to it on a daily basis, it definitely puts me in a great mood!!!
1603580557|5.0|I've read other books on systems and systems thinking.  None of them had the humanity of this one.  None of them took so much deliberate effort to include us in our own systems.  That might seem obvious, but if it is, why hasn't it been so evident before?  This is neither a long book nor a difficult book. Neither of those traits make it any less valuable, or enjoyable.  I'm going to read it again, and recommend it some more.

B001OQCV2E|5.0|OK, I've read the other reviews and I agree that the filthy rich being able to \\"buy\\" their way onto the arks to be saved in this film sure doesn't give the rest of us minions warm fuzzies.  The reason I gave this film five stars is because of the action and the FX.  From almost the beginning of the film, I was on a roller coaster ride of adrenaline, going from one great scene of devastation to another.  Ooh - there goes a whole chunk of California, sliding into the Pacific.  Just watch the little cars go over the edge!  Old Faithful and all the other Faithfuls let loose in a tremendous volcanic eruption.  Huge tsunamis drag little people from the arms of their tiny loved ones.  In the midst of all this, the fabulous actor John Cusack, relying heavily on the the open-gaped and wide-eyed facial expression, emotes frantically as he barely escapes one potential disaster after another.  The scene where he drives through LA while buildings topple is worth rewinding and watching again and again.  To all you naysayers who say P.U. to the plot of the film, just enjoy the mayhem.  BTW, I thought Danny Glover portrayed The President, but then there were moments he seemed to be not Danny Glover.  I spent a lot of time trying to figure out just why he didn't seem to be Danny Glover when he was, in fact, Danny Glover.
B00005JLEU|5.0|This movie is great for adults and kids both. It is not your typical animation cartoon. The story is one that you don't guess the plot to soon,but will keep your intrest.
B00275EGX8|2.0|Having never heard of this movie until shortly before the Oscars, I was eager to take a peek.  Big disappointment!  It is an okay movie, but for the life of me I cannot figure out how this one made it past the first level of scrutiny wrt even a nomination. I did not serve in Iraq, but did in Vietnam, and maybe things have changed ... a lot!   But I doubt it.  I thought it was a mediocre portrayal of war in general, their mission in particular, with an unlikely plot and barely believable props (Hueys?) and scene detail.    It is worth listing on your Netflix list, but be prepared for disappointment if you are looking for the year's best!
B002N1AEN2|5.0|GOODNESS. They just don't make music like this anymore...<br />...Oh, wait. There has never been anything like this.<br />This album stands in a league of its own. It is in a genre of its own. I must say, I listened through the Entire album on my first run through. From the moment I was caught up by the intro (cleverly named \\"intro\\").<br />The album is personified by a \\"chill\\" atmosphere of some sort. The intricate exchanges of lyrics between male and female vocals are a direct contribution to this aspect.<br />Discreetly utilized elements of sampling paired with the addition of electric and bass guitar make this album flawless. Each piece is simple, yet captivating. A feat that is never easily pulled off in music.<br />Art this Beautiful is a Rare Gem in a world polluted with generic music...<br /><br />I would highlight some tracks. But I'll let You choose your favorites.<br />Buy it.<br /><br />Enjoi...
B000UR366S|1.0|With each new release Joni's stature in the music arts has been diminished to where  she has become irrelevant. Shine, like everything before it until we hit Hejira is  virtually devoid of melody and anything approaching lyrics her once vast audience  care about. Ms Mitchell is creatively bankrupt and unless she is willing to lock   herself away for 48 hours with Court & Spark on replay, I hope she never steps foot  in a recording studio again!

0307472590|3.0|Si el fantasma de la ópera y el escribidor de La Tía Julia y el Escribidor (Vargas Llosa) hubiesen tenido un hijo éste sería el escritor protagonista de este culebrón. La diferencia entre La sombra del viento y la obra de Vargas Llosa es que éste utilizaba a su escribidor para reírse de las radionovelas lacrimógenas de la época a través de una divertida parodia de las mismas (hace ya más de treinta años), mientras que Ruiz Zafón ha dado un paso atrás en el tiempo utilizando \\"en serio\\" el mismo trasnochado elemento que le sirviera a Vargas Llosa para exagerar magistralmente su parodia. No concreto más para evitar spoilers.  A parte de esto, se notan defectos llamativos en la utilización del vocabulario, por ejemplo, \\"la luz se prismaba\\", el supuesto verbo prismar no existe; el verbo aducir está mal usado en varias ocasiones, sin su significado correcto; probablemente sea un anacronismo la utilización del verbo dopar en los años cuarenta, pues no fue de uso corriente en España hasta los años ochenta.  La forma de hablar de los personajes: está claro que a Zafón le chifla, y domina, el hablar ingenioso-pedante, la pena es que le gusta tanto que dos de los personajes lo hacen de forma continua, uno de manera esporádica, y a la propia voz narradora se le escapa con frecuencia. La consecuencia es que los personajes parecen tener personalidades intercambiables.  La novela consiste en una sucesión de entrevistas que van aportando retazos de información que contribuyen a la resolución del \\"misterio\\" (que resulta ser lo que muchos lectores adivinamos en las primeras páginas,a excepción del hecho que me ha llevado a compararlo con Vargas Llosa, que cuando lo leí pensé que era una broma). La pena es que en cada entrevista se nos repite lo que ya sabíamos, con lo cual el avance es lentísimo, ralentizado aún más por las agotadoramente profusas y repetitivas descripciones de cada mansión o vivienda pisada por el protagonista narrador.  Demasiadas vidas todas ellas descritas casi con rango de protagonista, y un narrador que se enamora de cualquier señora que se le pone delante (innecesariamente largo todo lo referente a la ciega, que no va a tener ninguna trascendecia posterior), lo cual ha dejado a esta lectora muy fría respecto a la historia de amor que se supone es el plato fuerte para él.    Le doy tres estrellas porque se deja leer y se nota el esfuerzo del autor, aunque el resultado no sea tan excepcional como las arduas campañas de marketing quieren hacernos creer.
B001OQCV6K|4.0|Sherlock Holmes is a name everyone knows, but forget what you think you know about Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's legendary figure. Guy Ritchie's Holmes isn't the buttoned-down and mild-mannered sleuth he is so often portrayed as in films, TV shows, and movies. He's still the brilliant detective with unmatched powers of perception and deductive reasoning, but here, his mental abilities are matched with equally formidable butt-whooping skills.<br /><br />A master pugilist skilled in unarmed and melee combat, he isn't the sort to wait around for the cops to show up -- he takes matters into his own hands, quite literally, with knuckle and baton. In the first 5 minutes of the film, we see him infiltrate a crime in progress and listen in on the inner monologue in his head as he talks through his plan of attack. With methodical and scientific precision, we then see him carry out the numbered steps with the ruthless, calm efficiency of a master combatant. This sequence is really fun to watch in the way it is filmed and executed and it happens twice in the film. At his best, Holmes is an unorthodox and cunning crime-solver with a penchant for doing things his way and little deference to procedure. At his worst, he is an erratic recluse, an insensitive lout, and just a plain ole slob, living out of Watson's home and performing chemistry experiments on his bulldog.<br /><br />But before you complain that this is untrue to Doyle's vision, consider what he actually wrote: \\"Although in his methods of thought he was the neatest and most methodical of mankind... [he] keeps his cigars in the coal-scuttle, his tobacco in the toe end of a Persian slipper, and his unanswered correspondence transfixed by a jack-knife into the very centre of his wooden mantelpiece... He had a horror of destroying documents... Thus month after month his papers accumulated, until every corner of the room was stacked with bundles of manuscript which were on no account to be burned, and which could not be put away save by their owner.\\" Doyle's Holmes was a deeply flawed character with many personal demons (substance abuse being one of them), and this is one that Ritchie returns to for this darker, grittier film.<br /><br />Robert Downey Jr, whose own life involved a lot of personal struggles, is brilliant as Holmes and I can't think of a person better suited for the role. Jude Law is Dr Watson, former soldier, Holmes' partner and best friend, so this is sort of a buddy movie, along with all the interpersonal dramas and conflicts of that genre. Together, they match wits (and fists) with Lord Blackwood, master of the occult and the main villian in this film, and his cultists. Set in a gray and dreary Victorian London, the set designs are beautifully done and a joy to behold. If you like period films, you'll love the art direction in this movie. We do see some overly CG-heavy shots like the unfinished London Bridge and one fight scene in the drydocks that is a bit over the top with CG silliness, feeling too much like [[ASIN:B000ICLRHU The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen]].<br /><br />Overall, the film is very entertaining and worth the time to watch if you enjoy action-mystery movies and are a fan of the two leading men. The many fight scenes in this film keep things moving and there are some comic elements thrown in, as well as a recurring gag with the dog. Everything wraps up neatly at the end with all the mysteries solved and the methods explained by Holmes, though at least one of the methods is very predictable and has been done to death in mystery films. The ending leave the possibility of a sequel wide open, which I am looking forward to seeing in the future.owner.\\" Doyle's Holmes was a deeply flawed character with many personal demons (substance abuse being one of them), and this is one that Ritchie returns to for this darker, grittier film.

B0009FU0ZQ|5.0|Just introduced to the old TV series with Tom Selik? (not sure of the spelling).  Found out is was a TV mini series that never got the go-ahead from the big boys in the office.  I found this to be a much more pleasurable show than alot of the soap operas or reality shows on TV today!  A well selected cast that played their parts in accordance with the books that were written several years ago.  Action/mystery & murder/romance, were all well written in the books & acted out by A-list & B-list actors from both movies & TV.  Just sorry the corporate big shots didn't feel it was economically worth the investment for a full fledged season.

B00001OH7U|5.0|Mere words cannot describe this musical masterpiece which never sounds dated despite being recorded in 1976.<br />  Bowie experiments with a combination of Plastic Soul, disco, dance pop, art/prog rock, and what would be termed \\"New Wave\\" in a few years, and all these facets and formats of music combine into one tasty mix for the ears.<br />  The title tune opens with the sounds of a train, and then a haunting, chilling yet mesmerising futuristic-sounding instrumental piece, and first, one may think that the whole song is an instrumental -- and then, suddenly, Mr. David Bowie's angelic voice, as pure and clear as fine crystal, plaintively sings of the Thin White Duke returning to throw darts at sweethearts and of mystical images (references to the Kabbalah) until, against a hard-driving, danceable instrumental background, he compares love to a drug high and notes that love has given his face that special romantic glow.<br />  The Gentleman's performance is no less glowing on such classic tunes as the peppy, poppy Golden Years, the lushly romantic \\"Wild Is The Wind (definitely music to make love by), the catchy TVC-15, whose lyrics may seem like nonsense to the uninitiated but is really the story of an hallucination Bowie's bestie (Iggy Pop) had of his sweetheart disappearing into a television set, and the gorgeous, hypnotic \\"Stay,\\" which wouldn';t have been out of place at your local disco, regular or roller, back in the 70s.<br />  Definitely a classic and highly recommended. Five stars, my eyelash! I'd give it TEN stars if I could!

0736092269|5.0|I bought the 2nd edition of this book well over a year ago when I was on a working out kick.  Unfortunately life got in the way and I stopped going to the gym for several months, and even when I started back I only dabbled with cardio workouts.  About 4 months ago I started back on weights and dug out this book.  Prior to that I hadn't opened it.  The book as it turns out had serious printing issues, making much of it unusable.  It was long past the time frame in which I could have returned it to Amazon so I contacted the publisher, Human Kinetics, instead.  Their customer service was excellent!  They were aware of a small number of mis-prints that fit my description and were more than happy to replace it.  The CS person asked if it would be ok if the replacement was delayed a few weeks until the 3rd edition was available which greatly pleased me.  I received the new book about a week ago and it was in perfect condition.  Many thanks to the HK folks for their fine customer service!    For those that don't already know what's in this book let me explain in detail.  Everyone has seen the anatomy posters on the gym walls.  The individual caricatures on the posters display a cut-away model of the human body sans skin.  It highlights a muscle or group of muscles and then shows you an exercise that you can use to work that specific muscle.  There usually isn't much more detail than that.  Text is minimal.  This book is at it basics a book version of those posters.  However this book goes much, much further.  The caricatures for individual muscles and muscle groups in this book usually have multiple exercise options.  Text in this book explains in detail how to properly perform the exercise.  It also provides useful tips on how to slightly alter the exercise to accommodate common injuries (ie, turn your wrists this way to not engage a torn wrist flexor).  There are several pages of guides and background information on how to avoid certain injuries such as not fully extending your arms when doing curls to avoid tendinitis down the road.  As another example the book goes into detail on how and why crunches should ALWAYS be performed with an inward curving spine (ie, fetal curve).  This is to minimize the usage of the Psoas Major & Minor hip flexors and avoid the back injury they can cause.  There are several excellent section of pure information in this book.  The caricatures in this book are truly excellent.  The artist did a fantastic job positioning and drawing the body to emphasize exactly what the reader needs to see and understand.  The 3rd Edition also adds text on proper stretching among other things.      I highly recommend this book to every single person lifting weights at all levels.  I've shown the book to friends, coworkers and people at the gym.  I've even sung its praises to complete strangers in checkout lines and restaurants.  I can't say enough good things about it.  The only negative thing I can think of (more of a wishful thinking thing) is that it's only available in paperback.  I wish it was also available as a hardback.  Taking this to the gym with you will wear it out eventually.  Of course for its low price replacing it is inexpensive.  It's an excellent resource.
B0036EBARO|5.0|Goldfrapp does it again!  Head first is another classic compilation.  Head First is uniquely and distinctly different CD from Allison and Will.  It's definitely more upbeat, fun and danceable than it's predecessor Seventh Tree (Also excellent).  It' full of a fun dreamy 80's synth-pop sound that is distinctly different from a lot of the other popular 80's throwback sounds currently circulating in the music world.  So throw this cassette in your walkman, grab your rollerskates and sunglasses and cruise the park.  Just in time for summer and worth the money!
031606792X|1.0|I'm going to keep this short and sweet:     I do not understand how these books have become such a phenomenon.  They're really nothing special, and I just can't wrap my head around it??  Meyer is not that great of a writer, and the stories are very cheesey.  I agree completely with my fellow 1-star ratings on here, that Bella just got every single thing she wanted (in the end) and there were absolutely no reprecusssions or anything for her.  There wasn't even a friggin battle at the end!!!!!!!!  WHAT WAS THAT ALL ABOUT!!  There was like 2 chapters wasted on everyone standing around 20 feet away from each other just staring, then finally the \\"Volturi\\" just turns around, gets back on a plane, and head for Italy.  I was expecting this insane Lord of the Rings/Chronicle's of Narnia/Harry Potter epic battle.  NOTHING!!!!!!      LOL- I LOVE all the comments about \\"Rennesme\\"!! HAAHHAAAA!  Stupidest name ever.  She should have just called the kid \\"Renee Esme\\" and left it at that.
B0030BOCIW|5.0|Different than the old stuff. Happy and alot like 80's music. I love the old stuff and wish Ville still wrote those kind of songs but he's not the same person he was then and this is proof of that. Good for \\"Summer Music\\".
B0034JGBM0|4.0|I rarely go to the trouble of writing reviews, but frankly thank those that do, especially the superfan who really knows and cares, like me.<br /><br />I have a couple WS boots because I had to relive the live sound I have heard just a couple times, so this first official release is right up there with those efforts and to a large degree the best live releases ever. I too haven't watch the DVD but look forward to it for one simple detail, the length.<br /><br />Why when the CD has capacity for 80 minutes does any band limit the length of a live release unless it a pure audio documentary of a historic show such as many have been the case. In this case, this CD is a mix of songs from shows across this brave and historic tour so of course there was more than 80 minutes of unique music/songs that could and should have been represented here. This concept is why I love the live releases from jam bands like The Grateful Dead and Phish; they fill the empty spaces with real music and rare gems, to give the fan the full value and the full listening experience. When this CD ended at less than 60 minutes, knowing that is the length of the real show of course, I felt why not fill this void with some rare gems or candid moments from the balance of the tour.<br /><br />The same thing happened with the double CD release from another favorite band Wilco, with their official release a few years ago. That release was the compilation of a set of shows in Chicago and I heard a boot from those nights, so why did Wilco leave out many songs and leave empty void on both discs? There is no valid explanation, same with this truly wonderful and long overdue White Stripes live release. Is it possible they did this to ensure a fan also bought the DVD?<br /><br />Oh well, more my crazy ramblings and for what that is all worth do yourself the major favor of buying this CD and enjoying the Stripes like all mortal humans should in the live amazing energy amazing ability style that only Jack could seem put out there. Good for them overall and thank you.

B000002J0B|2.0|If we compare this album with Led Zeppelin masterpieces like LP II, Physical Graffiti ou Presence, we find a quite irregular album, containing some gems - like the first three tracks + No Quarter - along with some of their worst songs ever: The Crunge and D'yer Mak'er. The other two, Dancing Days and The Ocean, are just average, the first one being a probable filler.  Let's be frank: if someone wants to listen to funk or reggae, the best choice is to buy an album by James Brown or Bob Marley. Buying an album by Led Zeppelin, everybody expects to hear only rock'n'roll and blues, with slight influences from other genres. This is not what we find in this album: The Crunge and D'yer Maker are simply 2nd rate experiments with funk and reggae that embarass both the performers and the listeners. Dancing Days is almost pop and No Quarter, although a good song, is really a progressive tune.   To be short, in this album LZ tried too much and delivered too little: this is pratically an EP, if we skip the bad tracks. That's why I give it only two stars.
0143038419|5.0|I read this book when it first came out in hardcover and loved it - and am now re-reading it in paperback - and loving it all over again. It's a wonderful hybrid of funny and poignant. I strongly recommend.
B002VECMAE|2.0|MASH and Dr. Strangelove are classic war satires.   War, Inc. and TMWSAG are 'lackadaisical' attempts at satirizing war.     An effective satire requires sharp touches of black humor and biting social criticism, which are surely missing here. So, unless you rummage through this heap for the slightest hint of relevance, this is merely an example of big stars agreeing to make this picture as a favor, since they are not in need of quan. Aside from a couple side-splitting moments, this was pointless and dull, simple as that.    Goverments have been known to invest in bizarre military training methods but the mockery has to be more polished than this clusterf**k to be amusing on film. Worth a peek for the most common French expression?
B000R9J3XE|5.0|This cd is worth it for the track It's all Over but the Crying. Such a powerful and emotional song that had me in tears the first few times. Garbage continues to impress me no matter what they do. Shirley Manson is a goddess in heavy eyeliner
B002QEXN2K|5.0|Got this as a gift for my wife. She has all of John Mayer's CDs and I have not heard any complaints from her regarding this CD. She says she really likes it.
B002K4MAA2|5.0|THis is a great movie. I dont ever ever ever rate movies but this one stands out. Its actually a UK series...i think 5 episodes but they put it together like a movie. If u go to AmazonUK you can find the duel region dvd...meaning you can play it on region 1 & 2 dvd player. The US uses 1 & the UK uses 2 so that dvd will play on both. ITs totally worth it. Grat movie. Acting is superb. The story is great and the zombies r actually scary. I personally love the zombie genre and I admit there are alot of crap movies. But this one is great! Actually felt uneasy watching it. SO convincing. Must BUy!
1905492073|5.0|This book is a very good read for any diver.  It is written by a technical diving instructor and written in a manner where you do not have to have a PhD or MD to understand the physics and physiology of diving.    Mark Powell, has gone through and read and researched many diving studies and presents the material in an easy to understand manner.    As an example, his description of a PFO is the first one where I actually understood what a PFO is and how they come to be, and I could now really the information to another.    If you just want to understand more about what your body is doing during diving or you are a Dive Master Candidate and higher, this book should be in your diving library.
1439190275|5.0|I did Atkins back in 1996 and lost 40 pounds. However, I discontinued it after 3 years because I caved and listened to ill-informed relatives who didn't understand it and said it was too unhealthy. Well, it's now 2010 and I'm almost done with my masters in nutrition where I've been told the exact opposite of what this book tells you - eat fewer calories to lose weight, eat less fat, more fiber and whole grains. This is wrong! I gained 20 pounds just during my time at school following this advice. Sure, SOME people can eat this way and not gain weight. Not for me. and probably not for many others. After reading Gary Taubes book \\"Good Calories, Bad Calories\\" I ran to get the new Atkins book and have lost 8 pounds while NOT counting calories and exercising less. I eat till I'm satisfied, my clothes fit better, and I don't think constantly about food. It is hard to go against the grain and I'm sure I will once I'm a practicing registered dietician, but I know the Atkins way of eating works for me and it works for so many others. You have to block out the naysayers who don't understand the science and just keep doing the right thing. Cut your carbs and you'll lose the weight and lower your small LDL particles - it's just that simple. My cholesterol has never been better and I have SO MUCH more energy to keep up with my 2 young children. My husband is a convert too after reading the Taubes book. I'm cooking the Atkins way for him and he's dropped 8 pounds in 2 weeks. I pray that Dr. Atkins is looking down on us and smiling BIG!!! Thank you so much for this book - it's really wonderful.    And for all those naysayers who keep saying \\"There's no scientific evidence that this type of diet works\\" - can't you READ?? There are SO MANY studies showing the efficacy of this diet, published in scientific journals. Here are a few in case you care to read them:        Journal of Metabolism. 2009 Dec;58(12):1769-77. Epub 2009 Jul 25.    Effects of dietary carbohydrate restriction versus low-fat diet on flow-mediated dilation.  Volek JS, Ballard KD, Silvestre R, Judelson DA, Quann EE, Forsythe CE, Fernandez ML, Kraemer WJ.    Department of Kinesiology and the Department of Nutritional Sciences, University of Connecticut, Storrs, CT 06269-1110, USA. jeff.volek@uconn.edu    We previously reported that a carbohydrate-restricted diet (CRD) ameliorated many of the traditional markers associated with metabolic syndrome and cardiovascular risk compared with a low-fat diet (LFD). There remains concern how CRD affects vascular function because acute meals high in fat have been shown to impair endothelial function. Here, we extend our work and address these concerns by measuring fasting and postprandial vascular function in 40 overweight men and women with moderate hypertriacylglycerolemia who were randomly assigned to consume hypocaloric diets (approximately 1500 kcal) restricted in carbohydrate (percentage of carbohydrate-fat-protein = 12:59:28) or LFD (56:24:20). Flow-mediated dilation of the brachial artery was assessed before and after ingestion of a high-fat meal (908 kcal, 84% fat) at baseline and after 12 weeks. Compared with the LFD, the CRD resulted in a greater decrease in postprandial triacylglycerol (-47% vs -15%, P = .007), insulin (-51% vs -6%, P = .009), and lymphocyte (-12% vs -1%, P = .050) responses. Postprandial fatty acids were significantly increased by the CRD compared with the LFD (P = .033). Serum interleukin-6 increased significantly over the postprandial period; and the response was augmented in the CRD (46%) compared with the LFD (-13%) group (P = .038). After 12 weeks, peak flow-mediated dilation at 3 hours increased from 5.1% to 6.5% in the CRD group and decreased from 7.9% to 5.2% in the LFD group (P = .004). These findings show that a 12-week low-carbohydrate diet improves postprandial vascular function more than a LFD in individuals with atherogenic dyslipidemia.

Comparison of the Atkins, Zone, Ornish, and LEARN diets for change in weight and related risk factors among overweight premenopausal women: the A TO Z Weight Loss Study: a randomized trial.  Gardner CD, Kiazand A, Alhassan S, Kim S, Stafford RS, Balise RR, Kraemer HC, King AC.    Stanford Prevention Research Center and the Department of Medicine, Stanford University Medical School, Stanford, Calif, USA. cgardner@stanford.edu    CONTEXT: Popular diets, particularly those low in carbohydrates, have challenged current recommendations advising a low-fat, high-carbohydrate diet for weight loss. Potential benefits and risks have not been tested adequately. OBJECTIVE: To compare 4 weight-loss diets representing a spectrum of low to high carbohydrate intake for effects on weight loss and related metabolic variables. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Twelve-month randomized trial conducted in the United States from February 2003 to October 2005 among 311 free-living, overweight/obese (body mass index, 27-40) nondiabetic, premenopausal women. INTERVENTION: Participants were randomly assigned to follow the Atkins (n = 77), Zone (n = 79), LEARN (n = 79), or Ornish (n = 76) diets and received weekly instruction for 2 months, then an additional 10-month follow-up. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Weight loss at 12 months was the primary outcome. Secondary outcomes included lipid profile (low-density lipoprotein, high-density lipoprotein, and non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and triglyceride levels), percentage of body fat, waist-hip ratio, fasting insulin and glucose levels, and blood pressure. Outcomes were assessed at months 0, 2, 6, and 12. The Tukey studentized range test was used to adjust for multiple testing. RESULTS: Weight loss was greater for women in the Atkins diet group compared with the other diet groups at 12 months, and mean 12-month weight loss was significantly different between the Atkins and Zone diets (P<.05). Mean 12-month weight loss was as follows: Atkins, -4.7 kg (95% confidence interval [CI], -6.3 to -3.1 kg), Zone, -1.6 kg (95% CI, -2.8 to -0.4 kg), LEARN, -2.6 kg (-3.8 to -1.3 kg), and Ornish, -2.2 kg (-3.6 to -0.8 kg). Weight loss was not statistically different among the Zone, LEARN, and Ornish groups. At 12 months, secondary outcomes for the Atkins group were comparable with or more favorable than the other diet groups. CONCLUSIONS: In this study, premenopausal overweight and obese women assigned to follow the Atkins diet, which had the lowest carbohydrate intake, lost more weight at 12 months than women assigned to follow the Zone diet, and had experienced comparable or more favorable metabolic effects than those assigned to the Zone, Ornish, or LEARN diets. While questions remain about long-term effects and mechanisms, a low-carbohydrate, high-protein, high-fat diet may be considered a feasible alternative recommendation for weight loss.    ******************************    Appl Physiol Nutr Metab. 2007 Aug;32(4):743-52.    A randomized trial of a hypocaloric high-protein diet, with and without exercise, on weight loss, fitness, and markers of the Metabolic Syndrome in overweight and obese women.  Meckling KA, Sherfey R.    Department of Human Health and Nutritional Sciences, University of Guelph, Guelph, ON N1G 2W1, Canada. kmecklin@uoguelph.ca    The purpose of this study was to examine the effects of 3:1 and 1:1 carbohydrate to protein ratios, hypocaloric diets with and without exercise, and risk factors associated with the Metabolic Syndrome in overweight and obese Canadian women. Groups were designated as control diet (CON), control diet with exercise (CONEx), high-protein (HP), or high-protein with exercise (HPEx). Free-living women from the Guelph community were studied in a university health and fitness facility. The participants were 44 of 60 overweight and obese women who had been randomized to the 4 weight-loss programs. Habitual diets of the subjects were energy restricted and were to contain either a 1:1 or 3:1 ratio of carbohydrate to protein energy. Subjects either exercised 3 times/week or maintained their normal level of activity for 12 weeks. The main outcome measures were weight loss, blood lipids, blood pressure, insulin, body composition, nitrogen balance, fitness, and resting energy expenditure. All groups lost weight over the 12 week period: -2.1 kg for the CON group, -4.0 kg in the CONEx group, -4.6 kg in the HP group, and -7.0 kg in the HPEx. All participants exhibited improved body composition, decreased blood pressure, and decreased waist and hip circumference. Actual diets consumed by the subjects contained ratios of carbohydrate to protein of 3.0:1, 2.7:1, 1.5:1, and 0.96:1 for the CON, CONEx, HP, and HPEx groups, respectively. Cardiovascular fitness improved in both exercise groups. There were no changes in resting energy expenditure. No adverse events were reported. Significant changes in blood lipids included decreased total cholesterol in the HP and CONEx groups, decreased low-density lipoprotein cholesterol in the HP group only, and decreased blood triglycerides in the HPEx group only. High-density lipoprotein cholesterol, fasting blood glucose, and fasting insulin levels were unaltered by diet or exercise. A high-protein diet was superior to a low-fat, high-carbohydrate diet either alone or when combined with an aerobic/resistance-training program in promoting weight loss and nitrogen balance, while similarly improving body composition and risk factors for the Metabolic Syndrome in overweight and obese Canadian women.
B002VECM6S|5.0|READ THE BOOK, whether or not you liked the movie. Although there is a SOME artistic license, the movie stayed quite true to the book, which was itself a very moving story of Michael Oher, with some help, realizing his potential.    Also, these folks are REAL. The private school coach, the players, the teachers, the college coaches, the kid from the wrong side of town, and even the perfect Tuohy family are all VERY much like people I've known and worked with in 34 years of teaching & coaching. The fact that \\"I KNOW that person\\"(actually, I know the character type, of course) made the movie a joy to watch.    OK, it was a little \\"Hallmarky,\\" but with large doses of FoxSports & Comedy Channel and a dash of BET to make an entertaining - and touching - true story. Bravo to Sandra, Tim, and Quentin for bring these people to life on the screen.

B0036B8MXC|5.0|This show has everything you could want if you liked Gladiator & 300. I liked both, but Gladiator a bit more. This show is extremely realistic, and what I mean by that is that it isn't ridiculous trying to show Spartacus be some kind of a superman from day 1. He has to go through a process like anyone would who was in that situation. All the drama is very real. You are constantly caught by surprise by realistic situations that you could easily see happening. All characters are extremely complex and have a lot to them that makes them all interesting. The relationship portion is extremely good, there is a lot of drama there. The show is very brutal just as it should be for that time period, and they're not kidding when they say they try to portray it accurately, they do a very good job with everything. Once you are introduced to all the characters by episode 4 or 5, you can really start to sit back and enjoy the show now that you have the groundwork for the environment layed out. Highly recommended. Solid 5 stars.
B002ONC9NC|5.0|This simple film by Lone Scherfig may be considered as another easy tale of a naîve girl, with principles, who makes a bad decision. I found the film enjoyable on all levels. Alfred Molina and Emma Thompson were very fine, but it's about time someone recognized Peter Saarsgard as the fine actor he is. Carey Mulligan is the center of all, and she is magnificent. A brilliant lead character, with confidence and natural charm. Definitely worth the  nomination, and I look forward to seeing her again... SOON! An enjoyable, fresh take on a simple story.

B001UV4XUG|4.0|\\"She's better than my dream girl. She's real.\\"<br /> That is my favorite line from a film filled with a lot of clever dialogue, (500) Days of Summer. It's spoken by Paul (Matthew Gray Gubler) to an unseen interviewer when asked about his long time relationship with his girl friend. He first goes into a long list of the ideal qualities of his Perfect Woman. But then acknowledges he prefers reality.<br /> It's a key point in this film, which, as its tag line says, \\"is not a love story. This is a story about love.\\" Or as the other tag line says, \\"Boy meets girl. Boy falls in love. Girl doesn't.\\" The film chronicles the 500 days of a young man named Tom (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) in his pursuit of a girl named Summer (Zooey Deschanel).  Those days are not presented in chronological order, which is one of many stylized features of this clever comedy.<br /> Tom believes in true love, and Summer scoffs at the idea. He believes there is one perfect girl that he will find and then all of life will fit together. Summer is just looking for a good time. Tom becomes convinced that Summer is his perfect girl and that they are meant for each other. Throughout the film, Tom tries to convince Summer he is right.<br /> The thing I loved about this film is that it skewers many of our society's false ideas about love and romance.<br /> Tom believes in a love at first sight, that one can trust one's feelings to know one's life partner. While it is true that initial attraction can lead to something more, immediate attraction (the pull of hormones) isn't necessarily trustworthy. God's wisdom leads us to rely not just on our feelings, but also our minds and His Spirit for direction in such important decisions in our lives.<br /> Summer believes there is no such thing as love. She observed the loveless marriage and subsequent divorce of her parents, and doesn't believe that people really can care for more than their own needs and desires. Sadly, many in our society have come to believe that narcissism is the only real option for life. Summer learns from her relationship with Tom that there may be something more.<br /> The couple enters into a sexual relationship quite early in their relationship. Our  culture claims that this is no big deal, but the film shows that a sexual relationship without commitment has serious consequences. Inevitably, one person will believe such a step means more than the other. Seeing the pain this causes Tom reminds us that God did not call us to wait until marriage for sex because He is a killjoy. Sex was made for the context of safety found in a committed, exclusive relationship.<br /> Sorry about being a little slow here. (500) Days of Summer came out in the summer but I just got to it a couple of weeks ago. But the movie has hung on in the theaters for months, having gathered a bit a cult following. It's listed, as I write this, at #197 of the top 250 films of all time at IMDB (Internet Movie Data Base... remember though, this list is voted on chiefly by young computer geeks). Its following comes from solid performances, a smart script by Scott Neustadter and Michael Weber and innovative direction from Marc Webb.<br /> But I appreciated it most for showing what love is not.

B001O2MBMI|5.0|I bought the Leona Lewis Spirit Deluxe Edition and I am thoroughly glad I did. Her voice is otherworldly, it is just the personification of beauty. She takes her songs and places such passion in them it will literally blow you away. I mainly listen to country music but when I heard her voice it simply captivated me. This album is rich in a variety of songs that have to deal with the heart and its emotions. Several songs are covers from other bands and she molds them into her own and sometimes makes them better. I will make sure to keep up with this artist who seems to be on par with the likes of Celine Dion.

B00337KM2S|4.0|Everything is pretty from far away. Especially from high above. A dump, a swamp, a sewage plant... nothing looks too bad if viewed from thousands of feet in the air. Something about keeping a distance.<br /> Last year's award nominated film, Up in the Air, provides many lovely aerial shots, along with a clever script, humor and competent performances.<br /> Ryan Bingham (George Clooney) is a big believer in keeping his distance. His life is about not letting anything, or especially anyone, close to him. In this film, directed by Jason Reitman (Thank You for Smoking and Juno) from the novel by Walter Kim, Ryan Bingham has based his life and his philosophy on travel. He spends all but a couple of his weeks in airplanes, conference rooms, rental cars and hotel rooms. The few weeks at \\"home\\" are in an apartment with as much personality as the hotel rooms that are more of a home to him.<br /> Bingham has two jobs. One is as roving \\"life transition consultant\\" (he fires people for bosses and corporations who would rather avoid such messy situations) and as a motivational speaker. In his speeches he uses the metaphor of a backpack. He asks his audience to imagine a backpack on their shoulders. He asks them to load the knick knacks of their houses into the backpack and then to imagine the feel of the straps on their shoulders. Then he asks them to imagine their furniture and car and house or apartment all in the backpack and the weight they would feel and the impossibility of moving around.<br /> Then he asks the audience to imagine their friends and family in the backpack. He argues that the more attachments one has, the tougher it is to move -- and moving is life. Talking to salespeople, he changes metaphors, and says they are sharks, and if they stop moving, they will die.<br /> There is something to be said about not being attached to material possessions. Jesus has a lot to say about being willing to give up stuff that would weigh us down.  But in the film, Bingham reconsiders his attitude toward relationships.<br /> It's true that keeping people at a distance keeps us from ugly sights (aerial views are prettier).

B002RSDW8A|5.0|I figured I would enjoy this movie, but for some reason I smiled throughout the entire movie!  Meryl Streep nailed Child's.  The voice, the demeanor, but I saw another side to the famous chef.  She was smart, and funny, and loved her husband dearly.  I didn't know Child's and her husband could not conceive, or rather it was implied in the film, and I found those moments very touching.  Child's succeeded in, what was at the time, a man's world.  Not because she felt she had too, but because she wanted to.    I am a big fan of Amy Adams, and I thought her Julie Powell was simply sweet.  She played the role as you would imagine a real woman would be-sometimes frazzled, sometimes happy, sometimes frustrated.  I didn't see any grandstanding or over acting, rather she played the average, every day woman, and seemed happy doing so.    What surprised me was that my husband seemed to enjoy it as well.  I will watch movies he wants to, and he does the same for me, and I don't think he was looking forward to this one.  Right before we sat down we talked to my inlaws and they said this was a really cute movie, and how right they were.  Even my 16 year old son enjoyed this one!    I wouldn't necessarily think of this as a family movie, but if you are at all interested in cooking and looking for a movie that simply shares a story, I can't praise this movie enough!
0385340540|4.0|Grisham is a great story teller, one who usually does a good job in painting a picture for the reader. He does that in this book. The problem with Grisham's efforts in this particular instance is the main character is forced to flee to Europe after his downfall. This makes it harder for Grisham to construct a tale that is as full of detail and meaning as would normally be the case with this great author. The result is that you are not as centered in one place as you would be in a Time to Kill or The Runaway Jury. The character's actions are great and well-thought out, but not as detached in any meaning because there is no place to connect to in this book. Anyway, it is still worth reading if you bought this book at the Goodwill, but maybe not full price.
B00004XPPC|5.0|I love this movie. It's probably the best movie of it's era. Alec Guinness and William Holden were great in it. There is a lot of action in this war movie and I would recommend it to anyone that love these actors and war movies.
B001TODCII|4.0|During the summer of one of my college years I got a phone call from the father of a friend of mine. He needed me to take on an emergency house-sitting assignment. I agreed to do so, and then asked for the story behind the request.<br /> Parents John and Marg had for the first time left their 18 year old daughter home alone as they went on vacation. It was Fair season in Sonoma County, and Janet (the daughter) went with a friend. At the Fair, the girls found what most teenage girls are looking for: cute guys. Janet invited her \\"new friends\\" to her house to play pool. A good time was had by all, and the guys invited Janet and her friend to meet them the next night at the Fair.<br /> The next night, Janet couldn't find the guys at the Fair. She returned home to find that her home had been robbed. She called her parents in a panic, then went to stay at a friend's home. That's when I was called to house-sit. Janet's foolish choice to trust these strangers could have led to something very much worse.<br /> In the film Taken, a daughter's choice to trust a cute guy does lead to much worse. On a trip to Paris with a friend, she is abducted by sex slave traders. The sex trade is a real problem, but I would think the cable news networks would be giving the Paris airports a little more air time if they were as dangerous as they are portrayed in this movie. But realism is not this film's strong suit. It is a fantasy about a father who will do anything to save his daughter.<br /> And it is a fantasy many Americans have been anxious to share. This low budget French production screened in Europe a year ago and just hit American screens in January. With a fairly low wattage cast (no offense to Liam Neeson who played Oskar Schindler and Qui-Gon Jinn) and is very credible in his role) the film is looking to make $150 million  and has had a remarkable staying power in theaters.<br /> I think much of its popularity is due to its playing out two fantasies (really two sides of the fantasy coin.)<br /> One side of the fantasy is for the parent. Neeson plays Bryan Mills, a former government agent whose job kept him far from home, damaging his relationship with his daughter and ruining his marriage. His daughter thinks he is overprotective and worries too much. (When his daughter tells him he should worry less, he responds that is like telling water it should be less wet.) His daughter ignores his advice and goes to Europe with a friend. When she's abducted, it's up to her father to rescue her.<br /> And if he can rescue her, she'll see that her father was right, and she will finally appreciate him. Columnist Jonah Goldberg wrote a very funny review of this film in which he called it \\"Patriarchal Porn\\" -- not at all in the sexual sense, but rather that the film appeals to a parent's basic protective instincts. As a father, he wrote that the film fulfills the parental fantasy of seeing a child realize that indeed, father does know best.<br /> The other side of the fantasy is from the perspective of the child. (I did have a little difficulty seeing Maggie Grace as a \\"17 year old child\\" in the film, since I watched the actress play an older character in the first season of Lost a few years ago.)<br /> Still, the fantasy of a Rescuing Father is a powerful one: the idea that no matter how dire the situation, there is someone who will stop at nothing to rescue you. And Neeson in the film will certainly stop at nothing. He breaks international law, risks his own life and quite ruthlessly takes others' lives. At times, he makes 24's Jack Bauer seem rather effeminate.<br /> He will stop at nothing to save his daughter.<br /> Don't we wish someone cared for us like that?<br /> At this time of Easter, we remember we do have someone like that. We've made stupid choices. We choose to sin, and sin leads to death (Romans 6:23). But Jesus entered the world, and He would stop at nothing to save us. But instead of taking the lives of others, He gave up His own life (John 15:13, I Timothy 2:6).<br /> Watching the film, unless you are a much more worthy person than I am, you can't help wanting to cheer when you see corrupt kidnappers and sexual predators meet their nasty ends. In the real world, God sees even the worst of sinners as rebellious children that He loves and desires to save.<br /> When Jesus died on the cross and rose again, He proved Himself the Ultimate Action Hero., unless you are a much more worthy person than I am, you can't help wanting to cheer when you see corrupt kidnappers and sexual predators meet their nasty ends.

B00316DDWW|4.0|Karnivool's introspective and ambitious new box of chocolates puts a fresh finish on their formerly generic progressive rock motif of photoshop textured bugs. Although this may sound like a mere assessment of the packaging artwork, I believe it speaks for the album's character as a whole. Sound Awake is streamlined and controlled, and, although Drew Goddard's drivingly weird bouts of scattered guitar riffage have been sacrificed somewhat, the spastic Set Fire to the Hive gives us a fix of this and Ian Kenny's flailing vocals both at their best, melded intelligently in a flaming composition. The band's ability to transition, both among the songs and within them, has progressed impressively, which is considerably more important than it might seem. Although songs like Goliath and Umbra still hold traces of their tendency towards questionable key changes, the individual elements of each song have more charisma and flavor than ever and can really rock it like a magikist. Lyrically, Sound Awake takes a profoundly scientific and psychological approach to the unfortunately archetypal 'revolution' message, ultimately painting singularly idiosyncratic imagery that compels us to forgive even the song title \\"New Day\\". Karnivool have proven themselves to be more than another Chevelle or Deftones or something, and the four years they were in production of this album was well worth it. Most alleged artists of today put out singles like hotcakes.
0786915749|3.0|This book was something that I was looking forward to reading. I was always a fan of D&D and other role playing games, and was under the impression that this book would appeal to me. So, I purchased the book and started on my path of discovery. Before my path could proceed I discovered three things. First, I learned that it would be much better to spend my time reading the instructions for my stereo or my wardrobe. This was just a writing thing, It was not well-paced or interesting. I mean someone who dreams of dressing his wife or girlfriend as an elf might find it interesting, but I did not. Second, it very predictable. A teenager could have written some that had more twists and turns than this. I mean, seriously, other than houses in trees, it was not at all imaginative. It was simply what you would expect from someone who had some awareness of D&D. Third, it was simply boring, it did not grip you through the writing. It just drug on and on, about as long as the dwarf was on his voyage. Anyway, my guess is if you like this stuff you will love it. I just did not.
B000XR49VQ|1.0|Prospero's Books is one of the most remarkable films I've ever seen, and this DVD is no way to see it. Not only is this DVD not widescreen (and this movie, with its liberal and wonderful use of digital compositing must be seen widescreen to appreciate the compositions that Greenaway was creating), but the video and audio quality are terrible. The audio is best described as muddy. The video is best described as an over-compressed, bad transfer from VHS. Ironically, a local video store had a tape of Prospero's Books available for many years, and it was widescreen. So this DVD is actually worse than the VHS version I've seen. There's no excuse for that at any price, but for almost $80 this DVD ought to be flawless and filled with amazing extras. It is not. Beginning with the terrible compression artifacts in the opening text, I watched about 15 minutes of this DVD in horror, then dug up my LaserDisc copy of the film and compared them. Both are cropped, rather widescreen, but at least the LaserDisc transfer had better sound and cleaner video. If you can bear to watch VHS, and can find the widescreen version, that seems to be the only way to see this movie unmangled (apart from the massive loss of quality caused by VHS itself), outside of a movie theater. With great disappointment I returned the DVD to Amazon. To Amazon's credit, they provided a full refund. Thank you, Amazon.<br /><br />At this point, I can only hope that someday soon there'll be a high-quality BluRay edition of this film. But I've waited for a high-quality edition of this film through three generations of technology and have yet to get it (with the LaserDisc and DVD versions being nothing short of embarrassing), so whoever owns the distribution rights to the film must not give a rat's ass about it. And that doesn't inspire optimism about future releases.
B000VZPBFI|5.0|This album came out when most of the folks my age had moved on from KISS to more mature sounding rock & metal bands... but as a young Marine at the time, I wanted to see what the boys had done and harken back to my younger years, when I had long hair and played rock'n'roll with my buds.<br /><br />I have to say that I Love this album above all of the other Kiss albums I own, which is all of them (even the ones some of you have made fun of like Lick it up, which I admit was a very weak album. due to sub-par guitar work of Vinny). This album showed that KISS had more musical & writing ability then many thought.<br /><br />I played this cassette until it broke and then bought another until it got sun screetch and then another until it wore out... I'm now on CD #3 of this album.  It is usually in my CD case between my vehicle that day or my home wetbar CD player after work.<br /><br />It's a toss up really between this and the 1st greatest hits album for which one I play the most.  My teenage son who, like myself, plays guitar, likes most of the songs... even though he plays \\"death\\" metal... he tells me he can hear the influence that KISS has had on many of the bands through out the metal genres over the years.<br /><br />Ya just gotta love the fact that these guys are still out there playing and kickin ass.  Long Live KISS!!!  From a longtime fan and a card carring member of the KISS ARMY since 1975!!!  ROCK ON!!!
B000MR9D5E|5.0|This BBC series on Planet Earth absolutely took my breath away!  A measly five stars don't do justice to this amazing series!  Narrated by David Attenborough, the naturalist (not to be confused with his older brother, Richard Attenborough of the Jurassic Park fame), every episode is educational, entertaining, and enlightening.  There are five discs in the box, each disc containing three 1-hour documentaries (except for disc 4, which contained only two.)  How the BBC photographers captured those incredible images are shown in the last 10 minutes of each segment.  It made me very glad that I wasn't the photographer walking around with my knees deep in the bat poop, or the photographer waiting patiently for 120 hours for ONE Bird of Paradise to dance, or any other amazing shots in this series!  If you haven't seen this series already, prepared to be dazzled.  This is our HOME planet!<br /><br />(I know this DVD came out in 2007, but I never got the chance to see the entire series until now.  I bought the box used from Amazon.com for much cheaper price.  The condition of the DVD was: \\"Used - Like New\\" and it was true -- it was like new.  Even the box looked new.  Thanks, Amazon!)
0440244870|4.0|I must admit I found this series really enjoyable and entertaining and a nice break seeing as I rarely read books like this. It's very funny but you HAVE to be in the mood to read it. If you're not really then you may not be able to get over how frustrating Becky can be. Becky can be really annoying and clueless and irresponsible so in order to enjoy this you need to be in a good light hearted mood.
B0036EBARO|5.0|With Head First, Goldfrapp proves one thing, that less is sometimes more. While Seventh Tree dealt with heavier and darker issues, complete with chill-out electronic tunes, Head First is closer to the heady dance of Supernature and the superb electro of Black Cherry.<br />While it is unmistakably 80s in sound and mode, Head First contains 9 solid tunes, all worthy of its own mention. Lead single, Rocket, gets you humming in no time to its catchy chorus and 80s beat.  Then there's Dreaming, Alive, Believer, I Wanna Live and the hopeful title track. Concluding the album is a surprise instrumental simply titled Voicething and for once, I though Imogen Heap had a guest spot on the album. This is a trip back to the 80s but with a modern update.<br /><br />Overall, it's one of my top Goldfrapp albums after Supernature and Felt Mountain. (A-)
B001E2JNA6|5.0|I have always been a fan of this cherished mini series. I bought the 2 disc special edition on dvd years back. My friend is hearing impaired and so I have developed a preference for captioning while watching movies. With British films it is extremely handy to glance down and read a phrase. The original set I bought didn't offer captioning so when I saw that this does I bought it. What I got was a remastered film that is so much better than the first set! I couldn't believe the improvement! There are some flaws but it didn't deter me. The special features has a segment about the process of \\"cleaning up\\" the film that was very interesting to watch also. I'm very pleased that I purchased this!
B000F6YW0S|5.0|I own three different releases of this wonderful music.  The oldest one marked CBS 1975, The pair of Bach Lute music CDs V1,V2 compiled 1997 by Sony, remastered by Bejun Metha, and this latest remastering and release Sony 2006.<br /><br />Each of them has a different sound. The oldest one has a thin and sometimes metalic sound.  Detailed yes, but does not sound like a real guitar. This one is labeled \\"re-mastered, mixed and edited by MikeRoss Treavor & John Williams. The newest one is an improvement, detailed, clear, and not as metalic sounding in the bass registers, but still a litle \\"hot.\\"  The one here is simply remastered using Sony Direct Stream Digital.<br /><br />The best mastering is the middle set of two CDs.  The instrument sounds like a real guitar, easy to listen to, non fatiguing, and at least to these ears, right.  In addition you get considerably more music on the two CDs.<br /><br />For sure the digital technology has changed over the 30 years, but the handling of the digital material, or perhaps in the tape transfer stage, there is a significant spread in the results.
B0035G5IOE|4.0|The first half is fresh and fun, full of unexpected characterizations that would never be caught dead (like a chicken) in a Disney film. The second half devolves into numerous Disney-esque plot contrivances, none of which I will go into because they might be spoilers to some. I just wish the story would have finished with the same energy with which it began instead of falling flat. I loved everything else about this film. A solid four stars that could have (and should have) been five.
B002TVQ4HG|5.0|WHEN I SAW THE TRAILER TO THIS MOVIE,IT LOOK VERY INTERESTING ENOUGH TO BUY SO I PURCHASED IT ASAP. THIS MOVIE DEFINITELY LIVED UP TO THE TRAILER PREVIEW. LEAD ACTRESS MELISSA GEORGE CARRIED OUT THE MOVIE WITH SUCH A GREAT PERFORMANCE. I DO NOT WHAT TO GIVE THE PLOT AWAY ESPECIALLY THE ENDING. I DO RECOMMEND TO LISTEN VERY CLOSELY TO THE MEANING OF THE STORY WHEN THE CHARACTERS ARE TALKING ABOUT \\"AEOLUS\\" THE GREEK GOD OF THE WINDS AND FATHER TO \\"SISYPHUS\\". IT EXPLAINS A LOT. I WATCHED THE MOVIE TWICE TO PUT ALL THE PIECES TOGETHER AGAIN. SO PLEASE AVOID THE NAYSAYERS REVIEWS. THIS MOVIE HAS MANY TWISTS, TURNS AND CIRCLES, LEAVING THE ENDING TO ITS CLIMAX TO \\"SISYPHUS\\". IF YOU WANT TO KNOW WHAT THAT MEANS BUY THIS MOVIE, IT IS A SUBLIME ADDITION TO MY LIBRARY COLLECTION.

B002Z8LPZ4|4.0|I swear I wrote a review of this already, but I'm doin' it again. Well, a short one anyway. Kate and Tom are always good, and she is always cute. Nice stark Antarctica mystery scapes and scenes. Don't look too deep into the plot and you will like it if you like the two main stays. Plot is thin, but I really liked the locale. The weather at times is half the bad guy. try it once anyway.
B002VPE1B6|5.0|This is one of the best if not the best movie of all time it has something for everyone in it.Seeing it in 3d was awesome this is a must own movie
B00003CXCW|5.0|The movie starts out with a dead man floating in a pool, with reporters flashing pictures and police officers trying to fish him out. The dead man begins a narrative of how he came to find himself in that state.  And so the story starts. Joe Gillis finds himself at the home of an aging has-been movie star, Norma Desmond, who thinks he is an undertaker come to bury her pet monkey *on the premises.* (Weird.)  Then, he is persuaded to stay at her place because he needs work screen-writing, and she wants his help. The next thing you know, her bald-headed, Teutonic butler, Max, has actually moved all his belongings from his apartment to her house. (He's done What?)  Working with this obviously delusional, over-the-top, former big-screen queen, who begins falling emotionally for this much younger man, becomes too much for Gillis. His breaking point comes when she hosts a New Year's party for nobody but him and her, and makes her desires ultimately known to him. He runs away, but upon returning, discovers she has tried committing suicide.   Max then reveals one of the most disturbing facts of the whole movie: he was originally one of her silent-film directors, as well as her first husband who has been responsible for propping up her psyche over the years by sending dozens of fan letters from people that DO NOT EXIST - all out of a devotion that is more disturbing and more unsettling than anything prior to this point. (Truly bizarre.)  Feeling obligated - first financially, but now emotionally - he agrees to become her kept man. Finishing up her script and sending it to the studio, she fastidiously prepares for an upcoming \\"return\\" to the big screen; prompting a personal visit to the studio to see her former film director, Cecil B. DeMille. It is discovered while there that the studio has not the slightest interest in her, but only in her antique car.   Meanwhile, Joe has been secretly seeing a younger woman, and is falling in love with her. Discovering this, Norma begins her final meltdown and the climax is on. Inviting the young woman, Betty, to her mansion, Norma is confronted with her antithesis - a young, pretty, ingenue, whom Joe is in love with. This pushes her over the edge, and she determines that THIS TIME she will not let her heart's desire escape!  Joe begins packing and telling Norma he's leaving. He doesn't need her anymore, because he has Betty and a movie script that's actually pretty good. His dependence on her has come to an end.  This is unacceptable to Norma! She will not let her grasp be thwarted, and with a final lunge, shoots Joe in the back as he falls into the swimming pool,(thereby bringing the movie back to the beginning, where the story began.)  All is a-twitter in the house, as Norma can no longer function rationally. She's obviously lost it, but how much we'll soon see. Thinking she is on a movie set, she begins addressing all the police and reporters as though they are the crew, telling how happy she is to finally be back where she belongs. She says her classic line, \\"All right Mr. DeMille, I'm ready for my closeup,\\" as she advances towards the camera in this creepy, over-the-top pose as she descends down the stairs into a final of state dementia. (Completely creepy.)  You want some extra creepiness? Check this out. The character of Max is ACTUALLY Erich von Stroheim; the former silent movie director who ACTUALLY directed Gloria Swanson in several silent pictures; (a clip of one shows in the movie.)   Unbelievably creepy. I've never seen a movie that works on so many creepy, larger-than-life levels.   I cannot get over how astonishing this movie is. Its amazing on so many levels. (The fact that many of Gloria's real-life silent screen pals were DEVASTATED by this film is a powerful testament to how accurate and spot-on the depiction was.) It wasn't real, but it was true-to-life, and they simply could not get over that.  That Gloria Swanson did not get Best Actress for this role is a travesty of epic proportions. Its as powerful a performance as has ever been given, and I rank it up with Brando's Vito Corleone and Scott's Patton. Its that good.  The relationship of Max is what sends this movie over the top. It would be one thing if Norma were functioning out of her own faulty grasp of reality, but that Max facilitates and keeps alive so much of it suggests a conspiracy of devotion rarely imagined. That the guile of lost grandeur, kept alive in the undertaking of this man, suggests an era of delusion so powerful and so gripping that few escaped its embrace. (Which is probably the most disturbing element of the whole picture - what WAS the power of those heady days that so enmeshed these two in its inexorable grip?)  BTW - the shot of Norma on the cover of this DVD is exquisite, as it conveys an introduction to the movie far better than the original movie poster. The photo was previously unreleased, and she never wore that costume in the picture, so its as if Norma returned for an updated photo shoot just for this release. Its fantastic.
0756405890|5.0|I enjoyed the book, it was long but well worth the read. I met Patrick Rothfuss in Cincinnati and he was very nice and funny. I would recommend this to anyone that likes a good fantasy story.
B002T9H2LA|2.0|I had read some reviews of this movie when it came out, so I wasn't expecting the best movie ever made, but this was pretty bad.  Way, way too talky, many scenes go on much too long, and I was often bored.  What I DID like are the European actors, all excellent.  The violence didn't bother me that much but the squeamish might want to steer clear.  I admire some of Tarantino's work - Pulp Fiction and Kill Bill I particularly - but this piece is poorly paced and the parts don't add up to a unified whole.  Brad Pitt and his cohorts seemed to be from a different movie altogether and the American actors seem like amateurs compared to the Europeans (particularly Christoph Waltz and Michael Fassbender, both very impressive here).  I wanted to like the film a lot more than I did.  I think Tarantino needs to be reined in a bit - it seems like he's a little too fond of his own dialogue.      The ad campaign for this movie was extremely misleading. In the TV ads the only scenes they showed were the ones with the \\"Basterds\\".  I was surprised that 80% of the dialogue was subtitled, and I agree with one reviewer here that the subtitles raced by awfully quickly at times.  I realize that if they had marketed it with Christoph Waltz as the main figure in the advertisement poster, people might have avoided the film because they wouldn't necessarily know who he was, but come ON!  Brad Pitt is in such a tiny portion of the movie.  Ridiculous.  I'm glad I didn't see this in the theater.      I would only recommend this movie on the strength of the European actors' performances, or to die-hard Tarantino fans.

B000001FS3|5.0|The subtle undercurrent of U2 is a poetic breeziness. Where the Streets Have No Name and I Still Haven't Found What I'm Looking For are introspective, visceral passages that they magically turned into anthems. Those two songs may be the stars of the album but the meticulous music and words for With Or Without You really showcased their inescapable talent. Mixtures of poetry, love lost, passion and the flavors of their authenticity. Few artists can make you see their music videos in your head.    U2's musical arrangements, softer alternative guitars and drums unless an anthem, really are their Rattle and Hum and they, especially Bono, is heavily influenced by Gospel themes mostly Catholic even if fans miss it. I Haven't Found What I'm Looking For brings out as much as possible. Critics say U2 is just a single song band but really are a album band. The first introduces the other then the next with few exceptions.    Bullet in The Blue Sky was criticized but is a gem; it was a glimpse of Salvation and Hell and why and even says, \\"...Rattle and Hum.\\" Definitely an alternative twist of U2's fate as songwriters, and performers. It shows just how poetic U2 can be. A glimpse into their subconscious. As this song, it is darkly lit except the first two cuts; Anthems with a purpose to divorcing themselves from past works to diligently provide a masterpiece that rivals the greatness of AC/DC's Back in Black.    The rest of the album is solid work. Of all the songs of The Joshua Tree, another Biblical reference, With Or Without You is a hypnotic trance with \\"See the thorn twist in your side,\\" a Biblical reference, and many other poetic lines. Who is Bono waiting for? It sounds like a lover but really is more than life. Bono is waiting for Eternity. The song proves U2 can deliver a cryptic message within and with many messages. Rare for a band. It had a short and powerful buildup to something to relish.    The Joshua Tree meanders, albeit powerfully and with purpose, between alternative rock to punk. Considering the massive ground they cover in this work, it is their finest work. \\"...hear the city groan...outside it's America.\\" If a casual U2 listener, you will be treated to why U2 exists. If a fan, you'll be drenched in the nector that has made U2 one of the finest bands in history that can't be definded. Joshua Tree is a masterpiece in its complexity as much as AC/DC's Back In Black was just so much fun. Both filled stadiums.
1608201236|5.0|I don't say this often, but I loved this book! It is the end of the series and you should really read all of them to get the full effect of the book. The book reminds me of film noir, at times dark and other times poignant. It draws you into the lives of the characters and answers the questions that have been left open from the previous books to give you a deeper sense of who the characters are and why they have done the things they did. The author has a wonderful way with words that draw emotions and visualizations from the reader. I thought the metaphor he used, the dark tide, was beautiful and so appropriate for the title. The story moves so smoothly there are no awkward places and before you know it is over. I was impatient to get the end because he keeps you guessing until the end as to what was going to happen and what the characters are going to do, but at the same time I did not want it to end. I am sad that it is the end of the series and hope the author will maybe right a story somewhere down the line with our characters in it just to see how they faired with choices they made. - Ana
B0036XN2L2|5.0|If the \\"Sting in the Tail\\" is really going to be the Scorps's final album, then after 40 years of action they will leave the world of music on a very high note, leaving a great legacy behind them that not too many musicians can match. Personnaly, after listening the album, I refuse to accept that they are ending their illustrious career.  Scorps are back to their best, delivering arguably the best record since the Crazy World record. There is still so much potential in this band, that I am sad to see them leave.  I have been a fan of Scorps for the last 20 years, and I have to say that Scorpions sound as fresh as 20 years ago.  The \\"Sting in The Tail\\" has that much liked 80's and early 90's sound, when the Scorps were at the top of the rock music scene.  Guitar playing is strong and Klaus Meine's voice is as clear as it was during the 80's records.  My personal favorities from the new album are:   \\"Raised on Rock\\", which is going to become the next concert favorite and is similar to the \\"Tease Me, Please Me\\", \\"Sting in the Tail\\", which features great guitar riff and has elements of the early 80's records, \\"The Good Die Young\\", \\"Turn you on\\" and \\"No Limit\\" - the heaviest song of the record which brings the sound of the Humanity - Hour 1 record.  Now the ballads.  All three ballads in this record are absolutely breathtaking.  They will take you on the journey into the 80's.  Lorelei is a song which could be easily included into any of the 80's albums with beautiful lyrics.  SLY, is the Still Loving You of the 21 century and the Best is Yet to Come will remind you of Send Me An Angel - a great way to end the album.    I strongly recommend the album to Hard Rock fans who miss the rock sound of the golden rock era of the 80's.  Thank You Scorpions for the music you have delivered to us for 40 years.  We will miss you.
0316069906|5.0|This book is a definite \\"must read\\" for any person who eats food (which, by my estimate, is all of us). The author has taken painstaking measures to document his work from factual, scientific and industry resources(there are almost 100 pages of citations and notes). He presents both sides of the argument (to eat animals or not to eat animals) and has valid, factual and philosophical views on both sides. At no point, does he preach. After being about 3/4 dones with this book, it has changed my life. Literally. I was a new vegetarian and finding it somewhat difficult at times, but this book has made me aware of so many things (yes, I verified much of the information) that I am completely turn me off from eating meat.....and not just for the animal rights and ethical reasons. I was so sick to my stomach while reading about how chickens are processed.     Ultimately, it is up to everyone to question where your food comes from. It is our obligation not only as Americans, but as mothers, fathers, sisters, brothers, friends....humans....to question what is it we buy and who we give our money to (ultimately, increasing their power and influence).    This book should not be your only source of information, but definitely should be a primary resource in your knowledge arsenal. I have purchased a few copies for friends--all have said it changed their life (and none of them were prior vegetarians with pre-existing opinions).
B002UD56I6|5.0|I bought this bluray with a passing interest in seeing it. I had no idea how much I was going to love it! I've watched it several times. Having grown up with Michael's music from childhood, the songs are timeless and poignant. You remember them all, and each one can fill you with memories and emotion. They are still fresh and are magnificent pieces of art. Michael still had all of his talent and more... his voice and dancing were amazing. We are very fortunate that the rehearsals were filmed! The editing is also excellent as different rehearsals were mixed together to form a \\"tapestry\\" of a song. MJ's pursuit of perfection is seen throughout the film. His brilliance in picking his back-up band and dancers is obvious. All of them were 110% behind him and their talent, as well as enthusiasm, is evident and infectious to watch; they always seem to exude \\"I can't believe I'm here with MJ\\". The band nailed every song and they all sounded identical to the album work. In the end, there is a definite sadness at knowing we will not see his talent again. I am truly sorry he is gone. He came alive on stage and that's where he has always belonged.
1854714066|1.0|This book is certainly not as advertised.  The dust jacket AND cover clearly state that it contains the complete novels of Jane Austen. It enumerates all seven in both locations.  It never gives any indication whatsoever that this might be the first volume of two.  Indeed the first printed page declares that it is in one volume.<br /><br />Despite all this, the table of contents only lists the first four books from the cover.  That is all that is contained within.  No 'Persuasion.'  No 'Lady Susan.'  And most important to me, no 'Northanger Abbey' -- the book I was planning to read immediately.  Amazing.<br /><br />Please be aware that the Bloomsbury Books edition (Under license from Penguin dated 1994) with the cover as shown on this page (with the customer image from Dilli) has these substantial defects.

However, they warn you from the outset that this is \\"NOT a love story\\" and they sure do deliver.  This is a story about what is fate and what is coincidence or do the two co-exist?    Not only that, but the originality of some of the scenes here--be it the musical number of the awesome splitscreen \\"desired outcome\\" vs. \\"actual outcome\\" are unforgettable.

B0039UTDFG|1.0|It is sad when someone as talented as Oprah is misguided enough to think she is a wildlife documentary narrator.

B000002GA8|5.0|Still my favorite Rick Wakeman album of all time. Brought the original LP back in '74 while stationed in Germany. I recall many nights of collective listening with my buddies in Darmstadt,Germany. The first time I listened to it I was mesmerized and enthralled. I had never heard Classical and Rock so well fused. It felt like watching an aural movie where the soundtrack is self contained. I've had this album on every format-LP,cassette,8 track,CD. This would make a great surround release if they ever come around to it(doubtful) Highly recommended in any format. Do yourself a favor and experience this very special recording.
0307463745|5.0|If Joseph Schumpeter were to design a \\"creative destroyer,\\" he would probably come up with a business thinker who bears a striking resemblance to Jason Fried and David Heinemeier Hansson. To me, they seem to be iconoclasts who are impatient to build rather than anarchists whose objective is chaos. They quickly indicate a healthy respect for the nature and extent of difficulty when challenging the status quo. But they are not deterred by that difficulty, as their success with 37signals clearly indicates, and they probably have more confidence in their readers' (as yet) unfulfilled potentialities than most of those readers do.<br /><br />Consider this passage in Chapter FIRST: \\"There's a new reality. Today anyone can be in business. Tools that used to be out of reach are now easily accessible. Technology that cost thousands is now just a few bucks or free. One person can do the job of two or three or, in some cases, an entire department. Stuff that was impossible just a few years ago is simple today.\\" That said, Fried and Hansson realize that many people who read that passage will heartily endorse its spirit but decline to embrace and leverage the opportunities that the new reality offers. For them, the \\"real world\\" is defined by what James O'Toole so aptly characterizes in his book, Leading Change, as \\"the ideology of comfort and the tyranny of custom.\\"<br /><br />This so-called \\"real world\\" has advocates who, Fried and Hansson observe, \\"are filled with pessimism and despair. They expect fresh concepts to fail. They assume society isn't ready for or capable of change. Even worse, they want to drag others down into their tomb. If you're hopeful and ambitious, they'll try to convince you your ideas are impossible. They'll say you're wasting your time. Don't believe them. That world may be real for them, but it doesn't mean you have to live in it.\\" By now you have at least a sense of the thrust and flavor of Fried and Hansson's perspectives on how (literally) anyone can rework what she or he does...and rework how she or he does it...to achieve and then sustain success in all dimensions and domains of one's life. Indeed, one of the most important insights shared in the book is that the most valuable business lessons are also the most valuable life lessons. For example, here are ten of several dozen that Fried and Hansson discuss:<br /><br />Learning from mistakes is overrated.<br />Planning is guessing.<br />Scratch your own itch.<br />Not [having] enough of [fill in the blank] is a cop-out.<br />Embrace constraints.<br />Be a curator, not a custodian.<br />Reasons to quit [and not quit]<br /><br />Note: The material in this chapter is wholly consistent with the gambler's adage, \\"Know when to hold `em, know when to fold `em\\" as well as with Seth Godin's observations in The Dip: A Little Book That Teaches You When to Quit (and When to Stick).<br /><br />Long lists don't get done.<br />Emulate great chefs.<br />ASAP is poison.<br /><br />Granted, the tone of Fried and Hansson's narrative is sometimes confrontational, in-your-face, but I think that is necessary because their separate but related purposes are to challenge their reader to \\"rework\\" or, in some instances,  \\"blow up\\" assumptions and premises about business success that are no longer true (if they ever were), and, to encourage their reader to adopt a new mindset, then formulate and execute new strategies and tactics that will achieve sustainable business success.<br /><br />If you need some fresh perspectives on how to get more done with less, including less stress, and do so with more joy, look no further. And if you share my high regard for this book, you need to check out Seth Godin's Linchpin, Guy Kawasaki's Reality Check, Scott McLeod's Ignore Everybody, and Hard Facts, Dangerous Half-Truths and Total Nonsense co-authored by Jeffrey Pfeffer and Robert Sutton.she or he does...and rework how she or he does it...to achieve and then sustain success in all dimensions and domains of one's life.

B002KSPKRS|5.0|Sound: Great.  Only popping and cracking is when I forget to take them off to go outside for a quick gaming break.  Comfort:  Great.  I forget to take them off if I go outside during a quick gaming break.      I have not tried them with the 360 yet. Works great on the PS3, with the some additional wires (see additional customer pics).  Works OK using Sony BT as mic, but you don't get the chat boost that is key when blowing things up.  Can't knock it for that because its not advertised to do that.  Will try on the 360 someday, and have heard from friends that it works wonderully.    I have a wireless network, cordless phone, and baby monitor all operating on 2.4ghz, with no interference.    I cannot compare these to other headsets being that this is my first set, but I really don't need or want to try the others after spending some quality time with these.    Ship time, when I ordered said 1-2 months.  The AxPros were on back order and I was tired of waiting.  I planned on canceling and switching if they became available before the X41s shipped.  I got the X41s three days after ordering and glad I did.

0812973992|4.0|If you saw the documentary Man on Wire, then you know that Philippe Petit strung a cable between the towers of the World Trade Center in 1974 and walked, skipped, and hopped across in the wee hours of the morning. This day and event ties together the stories of several New Yorkers, and even an amusing group of California computer hackers. Petit broke a few laws to accomplish his feat, and Sol Soderberg, one of a diverse cast of narrators, is thrilled to be the lucky judge who will preside over Petit's case. Meanwhile, Sol's wife Claire is clandestinely hosting a support group for mothers who have lost sons in Vietnam. Her Park Avenue apartment sets her apart from the other members, but in some ways she is the most tragic character in the book, in her lonely, desperate attempt to bridge the gap between herself and Gloria, an African-American woman from the Bronx. Gloria's neighbors include Corrigan, a monk struggling with his celibacy vows, a mother/daughter pair of prostitutes, and Corrigan's brother, recently arrived from Ireland. In this case, Gloria is the one walking the tightrope as she careens between the poverty of her neighborhood and her new friend Claire's opulent life. This started out as a snoozer, but I became more wrapped up in it as the narrators' intertwining stories started to click. At the end I felt as though I had definitely spun full circle, but I thought that Lark & Termite was more deserving of the National Book Award.

0425200469|5.0|Feels like the Orient Express all over again. But instead of being a shallow copy of the plot - a horrible thing for an author to do, yes? -- Death on the Nile is more than able to stand up on its own in terms of its share of thrills, its healthy dose of the whodunit among a motley crew of characters, and even its sprinkling of romance.<br /><br />It's Poirot again at his finest.<br /><br />No, really.<br /><br />(And, may I say, so far as I have been able to tread among the Poirot Mysteries, the one at his most introspective and sympathetic yet.)<br /><br />There's really a lot going on in here. Murder, theft, hidden identities, and so on. A most interesting contrast to the placid progress of the boat along the Nile where events take place. So the temptation to guess who onboard killed Linnet Doyle, the beautiful English heiress, is all the more compelling.<br /><br />There's the hot-blooded jealous ex-bestfriend, the unscrupulous American trustee, the sullen miss whose mother is difficult to live with, the mulish young man who spouts anti-capitalist ideals, the archaeologist with a strange telegram concerning, of all things, potatoes, the snobbish elderly woman with all the trappings of prestige, and so forth.<br /><br />One of the entertaining aspects of the novel are the levels of exposition Poirot deigned to make to whoever constituted his rapt audience at the moment. By dishing out in increments who might have done the deed in so-and-so way, and then practically turning to the reader and saying, \\"Eh bien, it was a good try, no?\\", Poirot is a master in keeping those about him in  tenterhooks. And a fair share of those who listen come out genuinely outraged by the lengths with which he stretches his conjectures, just for the sake of teasing the morbid thirst of those around him. A detective first, but a performer second.<br /><br />I can understand why Christie eventually felt a little fed up with her most famous character - Poirot is really a force to be reckoned with. And he attacks in the most subtle, unexpected, but maddeningly unreservedly ingenious ways. His `clearing away' of the `extraneous matter' in order to get at the heart of the crime/s is nothing short of impressive. And such brilliance of course cannot help but go into his head. In the meantime, however, I cannot but marvel at his skill. I'm afraid it might be a long time before I tire of him.<br /><br />As things stand, this is my second favorite after Orient Express. Very fast-paced.  Verging on dramatic, even, at some points. And, throughout, a very respectful novel...in the sense that it doesn't waste with the reader's time, and is in keeping with delivering its promised goods.<br /><br />Kudos again to ms Christie.ed, but maddeningly unreservedly ingenious ways.

B000SC245E|4.0|This is the item as described. The only reason I don't give it 5 stars, is that the cost per page of the LASER printer is too high. In addition to the expensive ink, you have to routinely buy drums, belts, and waste toners. This is in addition to anything that goes wrong with the printers/scanners(scanner bulbs, ADF wearing out etc). On the pro side the unit has been fairly reliable, except that it doesn't work well with aftermarket toners. These toners should be much cheaper considering how long they last in the printer.

B00005JMUA|3.0|I explained in my review of Kill Bill Vol 1 that I generally did not enjoy watching the first film because of its excessive style & overstuffed pop culture homages and references. Well I didn't enjoy Vol 2, either, but it's because of different reasons. The second half of Tarantino's Kill Bill has a fairly simpler style, and far less pop culture references. That's the good thing, at least for me. But unfortunately, it doesn't stop me from disliking the film. The problem I have with Vol 2 is that numerous scenes are unbelievably ponderous mostly because of excessive dialogue. I don't have anything against dialogue-driven films (All The President's Men and Glengarry Glen Ross are some of my favorites that choose words over action), but the conversations in this particular film are pretty dull and uninteresting. They drag on so long that you have no choice but just sit there and wait for the fight scenes. And speaking of fight scenes, there are only fifteen minutes of fight scenes here compared to the half hour in Vol 1. You'll be sorely disappointed if you're expecting to see Uma Thurman battle dozens of swordsmen yet again. I did like the performances: Thurman and the late David Carradine are wonderful onscreen, and the supporting cast do a great job on their own. Still, I can't say that I enjoyed watching Kill Bill Vol 2. Like Vol 1, it's not a film that I would admire, even though many others do admire it. Again, if you love this film, then that's fine by me. But in my honest opinion, I don't really like this film, so I don't care for it very much.<br /><br />Grade: C-

'White Horse' is right behind.<br /><br />'Hey Stephen' is also a good song. It's very cute because of the \\"mm mm mm mm\\"'s in the song. Like Taylor could just eat the boy up for dessert.<br /><br />'Fearless' is also a subdued highlight. I didn't really notice it much when I first got the album about 2 weeks ago. But now I like it a lot.<br /><br />'Fifteen', 'You Belong With Me' both singles, 'The Way I Loved You' (with its playful way with words in the verses and during the bridge) and 'Forever & Always' are also all good tracks.<br /><br />The only tracks I don't care for that much are the passable 'Tell Me Why' which sounds strangely similar to her song 'Picture To Burn' from [[ASIN:B0014I4KH6 Taylor Swift]] and the unnecessarily-bad and shaky vocal of 'Change'.<br /><br />Besides that, this is a good collection of songs that makes a pretty good album.<br /><br />Taylor has made a nice album. Her songwriting is pretty good, especially for her age, her melodies are pleasant and although her voice sometimes needs work (not to mention better range) these songs are fitting for tons of children, pre-teens, teens and even your adult who's willing to engage.<br /><br />No major complaints.<br /><br />4 stars or an 8/10.<br /><br />DOWNLOAD:<br />'The Best Day'<br />'You're Not Sorry' &<br />'Breathe'<br /><br />SKIP:<br />'Change'
0307456633|5.0|While reading The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency, I felt as if I had gone on a trip to Botswana without leaving my chair.  This book is a simple, elegant, mystery read.<br /><br />The main character is Precious Ramotswe, a thirty-five year old woman who with inheritance money from her father decides to open a detective agency.  She becomes the first and only woman to operate a detective agency in Botswana--thus the title.<br /><br />According to the author, Alexander McCall Smith, Precious Ramotswe is a traditional built African woman.  Mr. McCall is telling the reader that in Africa they like their women with a little meat on their bones.  There is a difference in the way that Precious is perceived by the men and women in the chapters.  Women consider her to be \\"fat\\", while men consider her to be FAT (fabulous and thick).  This does not seem to hinder Precious as she takes on her cases.<br /><br />Precious has endured the illness and eventual death of her father, an abusive marriage and the lost of her only child.  These events have shaped her into believing that she can do all things with God's help.<br /><br />Along with her secretary slash office manger Mma. Makustsi, she takes on several cases in one book.  Even though you might figure out the outcome of the case mid way through, the story will keep you reading.<br /><br />This pleasingly plump detective will keep the pages turning as you enjoy your trip to Botswana.  This is the first in a series, and also the source for the HBO series by the same name.  You will see Jill Scott in Precious Ramotswe.  I look forward to continuing my journey with the No. 1 Ladies Detective Agency.<br /><br />Reviewed by Maricia D. C. Johns<br />For BBW Reviews
B002DPA55A|5.0|Another fine output of music from a gifted writer and guitar player. The songs on this CD seem to flow from one to another. since this the deluxe limited edition, felt that the 3 extra cuts could have been included on the first Cd not needed on a separate one. The dvd are enjoyable seeing the studio that Mark built and uses, for us guitar freaks, a guided tour via his tech of some of the collection of his fine guitars and how hard his crew works on getting each show to be at its best night after night when on tour. The dice, tickets, etc, all icing on the cake. Suggest seeing the show when the tour hits your city/country this year.
1591795230|1.0|I was told to read this book as it happens to gloss over some basic biology topics I was discussing with someone. The information would have been much better been gathered from a text book or anywhere else.<br /><br />He writes from a style that is full of emotion but logically inconsistent. He argues for vague feel good concepts from evidence that is often contradictory, then a few pages later, refutes his previous opinions. The book seems like a (well edited) stream of thought to me. I've enjoyed books like that before when they give me ideas, but from this one I got none.<br /><br />I felt like I was being lectured by a stoner friend, who was really knowledgeable about biology, for the duration of reading this book.
0393072231|5.0|I felt immediately at home in the first few pages  of THE BIG SHORT, laughing with Michael Lewis at our driven culture.  He said Ivy League jobhunters thought LIAR'S POKER gave them the inside track on getting hired at Wall Street investment banks.<br /><br />There is nothing ponderous, pedantic, or politically correct about his writing.  Lewis has a unique analysis that cuts through the accepted, the obvious, and the successful to show the naked emperor underneath all the embroidered fabric.<br /><br />Here he introduces us to some fly-on-the-wall contrarians who looked at what was actually happening, instead of what was sold as a profitable, new, Cuisinart-inspired approach to spinning gold out of straw in the financial markets. He shows us the few, the happy few, who made bets against the tide and triumphed. It is compelling reading, full of characters, action, tragedy, comedy, and facts.<br /><br />I adore my Kindle and I keep it stuffed with good books.  But I would never hiss at this chronicle of the massive mess in our markets because it doesn't initially appear in e-book form.  Blame the publisher who hasn't yet twigged to the fact that the more copies one sells, the better.  That publisher is fighting a losing battle. Lewis, however, is a winning writer.  Sit back with his book, read it, and enjoy.<br /><br />Annette Rogers<br />Scottsdale, AZ

0385341008|5.0|I loved reading this novel and could hardly put it down.  It seems so real that if I did not know better, I would think that it was an actual, true story.

1402217722|2.0|This is one of Georgette Heyer's unusual novels in that it took place in Georgian period about 40 years before the Regency era when most of her novels took place.  The plot is focused around a marriage of convenience between Horatia, a 17-year-old girl (with a stammer) who is constantly getting into trouble, and the 32-year-old earl of Rule.  The premise was interesting enough as at the very beginning it was clear that Horatia was rather guileless and said what was on her mind, while Lord Rule was a rather laconic man who clearly found her quite amusing.  Unfortunately, it wasn't long before the promising premise fell apart in my book.  Horatia is in fact a reckless, irresponsible girl with a penchant for gambling, spending money quite wildly, and doing any impetuous thing that comes into her mind.  She came across to me as a spoiled brat, and I had more pity for Lord Rule than I had a desire for the two to fall in love.  I didn't find myself really at all interested in her character, though I enjoyed Lord Rule's.  I could also see some readers being annoyed by reading Horatia's stammer, which is portrayed throughout the book (constant &#34;b-but,&#34; etc.).  I did not find the romance convincing.  Being intrigued initially, yes; falling in love, no.  After the first chapter or two, none of Horatia's positive traits are really portrayed, and you only see her causing trouble and grief for her husband.  This book was a bit more melodramatic than the other Heyer books I've read, with mistaken identities, double-crossing, an abduction, a sword fight in an inn, etc.  This is less appealing to me.  On the plus side, like the rest of her books, this is &#34;clean,&#34; without any sex scenes, or even any more than a couple briefly mentioned kisses.  There's also wit in her dialogue, especially in Lord Rule's.  But, I wasn't able to enjoy it nearly as much because of Horatia's character.  I've now read about a dozen Georgette Heyer books, and this is probably my least favorite.  I would recommend instead [[ASIN:037381089X A Civil Contract]], [[ASIN:1402217706 The Nonesuch]], or [[ASIN:1402219482 The Foundling]].  The Convenient Marriage is not going to find a home on my bookshelf.
B002C6K7N0|4.0|this release felt a bit odd for me at first listen. i latched on to a couple of tunes to start, then the ones i didn't connect with at first began to grow on me. it's different and a bit quirky in places but i dont mind when a band mixes it up. it's an evolution that any great band will go through eventually. it's plenty heavy and plenty fast where it needs to be and there are some areas that just groove or meander a bit. i will say that there are none of those moments where you feel a rush of adrenaline or just want to go kick someones ass, it's rather more anthem like and works well in it's own capacity. if rust in peace is a five, then this one gets a four. you'll enjoy it, i promise. props to mustaine and his employees.
B002VPE1B6|5.0|I HAVE SEEN THE FUTURE OF CINEMA...James Cameron's AVATAR Review  By Carl F.       Back in 1939, audiences were left breathless when Dorthy stepped into the Techincolor world of Oz.  70 years later, audiences are in for the same treat.      For the past four years people have been doubting James Cameron's next film, AVATAR.  They would say it'd be horrible.  The effects would be a joke, the story stupid, and they even compared it to the biggest flop ever, the animated film DELGO.  Well, Mr. Cameron can look at all of those people and with a smile on his face simply say \\"Ha ha.\\"          We enter the alien world through the eyes of Jake Sulley, a former Marine confined to a wheel chair.  But despite his broken body, Jake is still a warrior at heart.  He is recruited to travel lightyears to the human outpost on Pandora, where coprparations are mining a rare mineral that is key to solving Earth's energy crisis.  Because the air of Pandora is toxic, they have created the Avatar program in which human \\"drivers\\" have their consciousness linked to an Avatar, a remotley controlled biolagical body that can survive in the lethat are.  These Avatars are gentically engineered hybrids of human DNA mixed with DNA from the natives of Pandora- the Na'vi.           Reborn in his Avatar form, Jake can wlak again.  He has been given a mission to inflitrate the Na'vi, who have become a major obstacle to mining the precious ore.  But a beautiful Na'vi female, Neytiri, saves Jakes life, and changes everything.  Jake is taken into her clan and learns to become one of them, which involves many test and adventures.  As Jakes relationship with the relcutant teacher Neytiri deepens, he learns to respect the Na'vi way and finally takes his place among them.  Soon he will face the ultimate test when he leads them in an epic battle that will decide nothing less than the fate of an entire world.*      When it comes to CGI, I usually hate it.  I prefer my effects to be done for real as much as possible.  The perfect example of that would be THE DARK KNIGHT or even Cameron's last film, TITANIC.  But    James Cameron does  such an amazing job at telling this fresh and wonderful story with the most impressive visuals I have ever seen, my old line of thinking fades away and the new one is that if they can make it look so real, I'm game.  The work that Cameron has spent doing over the past 12 years has more than paid off.  For the first time ever, it's nearly impossible to tell what is CGI from the real world.  The Na'vi's look so real you could reach out and touch them and the world of Pandora is so lush and colorful it seems almost as if Cameron just went to a real planet a shot as documentary.  The speical effects in this film are so good, that they make films like TRANSFOMERS, STAR WARS (the new ones), & DISTRICT 9 look like childs play.    Using a much better form of motion capture that director Robert Zemeckis has used so creeplily in THE POLAR EXPRESS, BEOWULF, and this years A CHRISTMAS CAROL, Cameron avoids the infamous \\"dead eye\\" look and makes the creatures look real, not an odd mixture of real and plastic.   To sum up the visuals, and not ramble on, what you will see on screen will surely leave you in awe. With years of hard work and trials and tribulations, James Cameron has raised the bar for CGI and motion capture to a point that I think only he can reach.  And when it comes to the 3D, Cameron score again.  Every live action film to date in 3D has been a horrible cheese fest.  From the cheesy JOURNEY TO THE CENTER OF THE EARTH, the down right awful MY BLOODY VALENTINE, to the lackluster THE FINAL DESTINATION, live action 3D has only had one purpose: gimmick.  But with AVATAR, Cameron makes sure that doesn't happen. Not once is something forced into your face.  While stuff does feel like it'll get you at a few points, the main advatage is how the 3D brings you into the film, not bring stuff at you.  When a group of soldiers are being prepared for battle, you feel like your sitting right there with them.  When Jake and Neytirir are flying around on creatures, you can almost feel the wind through your hair.  With 3D, Cameron has finally proven how it should be used.  To submerse the audince in the film.  To surrond it aorund them.  Now I would have no issue with every film, from action to drama to horror to romance being in 3D.  Could you imagine what i'd feel like walking  down the yellow brick road with Dorthy?  Sitting next to the Godfather as he makes an offer no one can refuse? Or hanging off the bow of the Titanic as she slips into her watery grave? It would be beyond words.  And thats exactly how the technology of AVATAR is.  (By the way, Cameron is planning on a 3D re-release of TITANIC, so thats one adventure you won't wanna skip either!)        When it somes to the rest of the film-contrary to other reviews- its just as good.  Well a few characters may not equal the greatness of other Cameron classics, their just as good.  Sam Worthington (TERMINATOR SALVATION) stands out above all as our hero Jake.  He comes off as natural and you instantly connect with his character.  Other great cast member include Zoe Saldana (STAR TREK) is perfect as Neytiri, Sigourney Weaver (ALINES) is absolute perfection as always as the hard lined Dr. Grace Augustine, Stephen Lang (PUBLIC ENEMIES) as the down right nasty Colonel, Michelle Rodreguiz (FAST & FURIOUS) as the risky pilot Trudy, and many many more.  Not once performance is wasted in the film.  There are a few cheesy lines of dialouge in it, but what film doesn't have that?  The story is great and its so refreshing to see a story not based on a book, toy, or comic.  It's so refrshing to enter a wrold you have no idea about.    And don't worry about the running time.  Nearly almost 3 hours, you fly right through the film and when the credits role with the tear jerking \\"I See You\\" Leona Lewis song, you'll want to stay seated and enjoy the ride again.         Overall,James Caemron's AVATAR not only lives up to the hype, it explodes it.  No one had a clue how great it was going to be.  From the awesome effects to the relatable characters, you can't loose with this film.  Not only is AVATAR the best film I've seen this year, I dare say it's one of the best films EVER made.  And the man who proclaimed himself \\"KIng of the World\\" at the 1998 Oscars, well not only is he still the king of the world, but now he's officaly a true god of cinema.  I give JAMES CAMERON'S AVATAR an A+  -Carl F.       *plot taken from [...].    PS    Get the BLU_RAY now. Don't wait for the Ultimate Edition.  This is a film that deserves to be seen over and over as soon as possible.  Hell, Ill buy every version but I highly reccomend picking it up now and just getting future editions later.  Also, the film will be just as great in 2D as it was in 3D. I promise.
6304696515|1.0|I don't honestly know what I expected when I decided to rent this movie - I should have researched it a little better.  I found the story and the characters completely unsavory and, while the irony did not at all escape me, I felt almost sickened seeing the way some humans treat one another. Don't get me wrong, I like historical movies and (especially) British mysteries, but most of them have some redeeming values; however, I could not find any in this film. I thought Glen Close's character was snakelike and repellent and can't imagine why any man with half a brain would want to sleep with her, much less go to a lot of trouble to do it. I did try to watch \\"Valmont\\" because I like Colin Firth, but this whole story is just too offensive to me to enjoy.
B001HN6940|4.0|I loved seeing this film in 3-D at the theater.  I am hoping it will be offered on DVD in a 3-D format if it can be done well.  However, I'm sure a Blu-ray 2D copy would be extremely wonderful.  The story is darker than most treatments of the Alice in Wonderland/Through the Looking Glass stories.  More for the teen to senior crowd.  Leave the very little ones at home. The connection between the  characters in Alice's real life and her dream life is apparent throughout the film thanks to the scenes before she falls down the rabbit hole.  It is easy to sympathize with the plight of Alice and the creatures she meets in this \\"wonderland\\" ruled by the Red Queen.  Their characters are well developed.  It is both gripping and touching to see them work through each challenge as a team.  The action is very exciting.  The settings are beautiful and creative.  An all star cast, including Tim Burton veterans: Johnny Depp, Helena Bonham-Carter, Alan Rickman and Timothy Spall make this movie a must see.  Anne Hathaway also appears in a delightfully unusual role as the White Queen.
1439190275|5.0|If you're overweight or just want a healthier way to live, read the book, do your research and then try it.  BUT you have to do it properly and educate yourself.      The authors of this book have made great strides in bringing the science behind this diet to the general public - they've made the science much easier to understand and if you understand the science and what is going on with your body when we eat the way we do, the easier it is going to be.    The Atkins way of eating is for LIFE, it isn't just a 4 week diet where you lose some weight then revert back to your old ways.      A typical day's eating for me is:  b/fast - mixed vegetable omelette; lunch - very large salad with tuna, mayo, avocado; dinner - roast pork, broccoli, mushrooms, sprouts and onions with a chocolate cheesecake with raspberries and cream for dessert.  Tea, coffee and water to drink.  Not that bad is it?    btw, vegetarians and vegans can follow Atkins, no problem - I have a family member who is doing great on it.
B0001V6ZJ8|5.0|I cannot say enough nice things about this film. First of all, despite the tragic life of Henri de Toulouse Lautrec, this is a happy movie. The exuberance of the can-can dancers and the sparkle of Zsa Zsa Gabor play away from Lautrec's loneliness and alcoholic despair while making the viewer more sympathetic. The script is admirably balanced, and the character development is superb. But herein lies the movie's weakness, which is that it tells more about these people than about Lautrec's study and growth as an artist. In contrast, the Van Gogh bio-movie Lust for Life, tells more about how Vincent learned to paint, the long hours he spent, the practicing, the frustrations with instruction, than it tells about the supporting characters. But viewers should certainly forgive this lack, epecially those who are into Art and  who already know just how much work it takes; nobody sits down before an easel and dabbles out a masterpiece in fifteen minutes; there is a lifetime of ability, perserverance and individualization realized in every stroke of the brush. Another plus is that this film really captures the spirit of \\"The Gay Nineties.\\" Also, it gives a pretty good idea of the Art Market; showing the dealer, the collector and among the customers, a King! This is a film that should be viewed with a bottle of French Champagne,a feather boa,  and a poodle with a very frou-frou bow around its neck!
0743496736|4.0|This is Picoult's finest work. Her prose is unbelievably beautiful in this novel even when the subject matter is very dark and disturbing for some people. Picoult manages to tackle the controversy and turn it into something meaningful. The topic of bullying in school is so important. I was bullies mercilessly and this book made me ache with sympathy for all involved. It makes you question things and turns your ideas upside own.
B002VPE1B6|1.0|This is a waist of money like the Lord of the rings one, just wait until November for the ultimate edition.    Fox continues to pull back the layers of its release schedule for Avatar after yesterday's press event with director James Cameron, producer James Landau and Earth Day Network President Kathleen Rogers (above) as Reuters indicates the Blu-ray 3D version will arrive next year. What does 2010 hold for the most dedicated fans of Pandora? While the DVD and Blu-ray editions due April 22 will arrive stripped clean of any extras whatsoever, a registration code slipped in the case will give owners access to \\"The AVATAR Program\\" to view bonus content online, adopt a \\"virtual hometree\\" among the million being planted and other enticements to string them along connect this release with an ultimate edition due in November. Check the press release after the break for all the details and see if you can resist the urge to triple dip.
0802130208|5.0|Sometimes, it is not what you read in the novel, but what is written about the novel or novelist that tells you the full story.  This is one such book where the \\"rest of the story\\" delivered in the foreward and on the internet help explain the novel.<br /><br />This lumbering New Orleans resident protagonist is a  cretin named Ignatius Reilly has problems with his \\"valve\\" and mouth which make the reader laugh and cry on almost every page. His mother-son confrontations are merely verbal jawings, but of tenacity of Mommy Dearest.  The barbs between babe and mom are cutting, and Walter Percy's (author of [[ASIN:0375701966 The Moviegoer]] - another New Orleans tale of a sad sack) revelation that the author's mother posthumously tendered the manuscript to him with pride - you knew this could not be autobiographical. And, that God Percy lost out in trying to evade Mother Toole's request that he read the manuscript. \\"Over the years I have become very good at getting out of things I don't want to do. And if there was something I didn't want to do; this was surely it: to deal with the mother of a dead novelist and worst of all, to have to read a manuscript that she said was GREAT, and that, as it turned out, was a badly smeared, scarcely readable carbon.\\" The rest is history.<br /><br />And, the dialogue flows.  Ignatius introduces us to black janitors, white liberals, homosexual cross-dresser, high school pornographers, strippers with birds, undercover cops who work the mens rooms, and more.  And, that is in the first few pages - or so.<br /><br />New Orleans is seedy, maybe seedier here than in Blanche Dubois's worst days in Tennessee Williams's New Orleans. Being a tourist with jingle in your pocket in that city may be fun.  Being broke in New Orleans, we learn, is not a life of fruit and plenty for the locals.<br /><br />And, as Ignatius spirals downward in his  plunge to despair and ridicule, we learn that he sees little, if any, light at the end of the tunnel. Ignatius opines about how others think he should be put into the loony bin:\\"They would try to make me into a moron who liked television and new cars and frozen food. Don't you understand? Psychiatry is worse than communism. I refuse to be brainwashed. I won't be a robot!\\" This frustration later leads to passages concerning suicide. And, such depression he knew. Wikipedia states: \\"It was during what is assumed to be a trip back to New Orleans that Toole stopped outside Biloxi, Mississippi, on March 26, 1969, and committed suicide by running a garden hose from the exhaust pipe in through the window of the car in which he was sitting.\\"<br /><br />The oratory of the overeducated underachieving Ignatius reminds me of the gifted lip from Walter Matthau's Willie Gingrich of Billie Wilder's [[ASIN:B000056HEF The Fortune Cookie]].  Ignatius is a bumbler like Kingsley Amis's [[ASIN:0140186301 Lucky Jim (Penguin Classics)]]. He is a slob like another Walter Matthau special - Oscar Madison. But, this is not a parallel figure.  This complex and unique character, which I believe to be close to the heart of the author, is one of fiction's great gifts.e should be put into the loony bin:\\"They would try to make me into a moron who liked television and new cars and frozen food.

B001UUY3A2|5.0|it was a little difficult finding the exact version i wanted, that did not appear boot legged. i finally (and was glad I) found this for sale at a very resonable price. It has the version with the characters speaking Cantonese, with which i am so very slightly familiar. The story is entertaining and enjoyable to me, an Wing Chun Instructor within the IWCMAA.
0545123267|1.0|If you want a paranormal romance, please avoid this pitiful novel. Honestly, after the first few chapters, it reminded me of a poor girl's Twilight Saga. Sam is a werewolf who has loved the fiercely independent Grace since he saved her from his pack 6 years earlier. After he gets shot by a hunting party (and recovers just as quickly as Twilight's resident werewolf Jacob does), Grace takes him into her home underneath her (absent and flighty) parents' noses. Their \\"whirlwind romance\\" is hinged on the fact that this is his last year as a human and the fact that they can't truly be together because he's a werewolf. Like I said, it's a poor girl's Twilight. Substitute werewolf for vampire and Sam for Edward, and tada! This author is a terrible writer. At times, the things this 17 year old character is saying seems as if it would be more appropriate coming from a 13 year old. The character POV switches with every chapter, lending to a story that simply does not flow well. It's fanfic gone bad. If you want Twilight, I suggest picking up the real thing and leaving this terrible book on the shelf.
B0030IIYWA|5.0|\\"Toy Story\\" and \\"Toy Story 2\\" belong to that tiny group of perfect movies that includes \\"2001\\", \\"The Adventures of Robin Hood\\", \\"Amadeus\\", \\"Chinatown\\", \\"Citizen Kane\\", \\"L A Confidential\\" and a few others. They remain fresh, funny, and engaging even after many viewings.<br /><br />One of the reasons for \\"Toy Story\\"'s perfection is that it combines technology and subject matter so well. If you were going to make the first feature-length computer-animated film, what could be a better subject than animism -- the belief that inanimate objects are inhabited by spirits? That idea has been around for thousands of years, and though \\"Toy Story\\" is not the first film presenting it (see, for example, Ladislav Starevich's \\"The Mascot\\"), it does it spectacularly well.<br /><br />A note to all you fundys complaining about magic and the black arts in Disney films... Why aren't you complaining about this one? Do you really want your kids to believe their toys \\"come to life\\" when no one's around? It's the work of Satan!<br /><br />The Blu-ray transfer is, as I've gotten tired of writing about Disney films, spectacular. The \\"extras\\" include not only new material, but previous material from DVD editions. (Whether the latter is complete, I don't know, because I no longer have the DVDs.) My only complaint is that there is, oddly, no digital copy, which might be important to some buyers.

0061231401|5.0|In the covert world of Sigma force James Rollins continues to astound with exotic and hair raising action based on a plausable plot. His sense of timing, humor and plot development coupled with an endearing character development makes his novels extremely enjoyable to read as well as instant classics. I love this guy's imagination and can't help but think he may have been a great animal psychologist as a veterinarian because he surely knows about human psychology and how to motivate and excite us.<br /><br />The Doomsday key addresses two of the world's greatest problems, famine and overpopulation. There are very industrious and well meaning people trying to address these problems on a global scale but sometimes good intentions go awry because the industrialists are myopic, trusting and so caught up in their vision that they fail to see how evil people and organizations can infaltrate and manipulate their sense of humanity. When this happens Sigma must get involved in a very decisive and powerful way but even Sigma is not immune to manipulation and must make alliances with misguided people.
6305076995|5.0|Prime example of an excellent rock and roll band, in top form.  Much has been said of the quality of the production.  I see no big deal.  It was produced from footage from 1973.  It's not Paul McCartney or U2, but it is of sufficient quality for an enjoyable experiance.  It's not fuzzy or materially lacking in any way.  The video is quite clear and gives an accurate reproduction of a Yes concert from 1973.  The camera angles are very good, the camera is not bouncing around all over the place from musician to musician like some of the the more recent DVD's.  I have a Cream DVD from 1968 the quality is really quite good, and this footage is at least as good if not better.  I was hesitant to get it fearing it would have been sorely lacking in quality, but I was pleasantly surprised.  Yes is an awesome band, and this DVD does total justice.

Seriously, I grew up in the 80's hair glam era, listening to the likes of Warrant's \\"Cherry Pie\\" & Bulletboys \\"Smooth Up\\" and thought that was too much. BUT NOOOOOO--now we got a band that makes THEM look like Disney in comparison! JUST GOOGLE UP & READ THE LYRICS TO THIS ALBUM FIRST! IT'S SLEAZY TRASH TO THE MAX!    I can't believe the metal magazines that are praising this piece of trash left & right! It's in their top albums of 2009! Why? I guess the magazine editors fit the profile at the beginning of this review...    Looking for some excellent \\"hair band\\" music from the last decade, check out OUTLOUD. The album kicks butt and, thankfully, keeps the sexually explicit details out. BUY OUTLOUD, SKIP STEEL PANTHER. PERIOD.

I grew up listing to Ozzy as a solo artist and got into his stuff with Black Sabbath after I kenw and listend to him as a solo artist.  This book is funny and at times has good words to follow.  It is amazing to know the stuff that he has been through with alcohol and drug addiction but is still a family man and loves his kids.  He shows that he doesn't hold grudges against anyone and is very grateful to be where his is even though he has made plenty of mistakes.  I would say this book would be a good read for anyone wanting a laugh.
B002VECM6S|5.0|Absolutely loved this movie!  I was so touched by this film and family who were willing to do whatever it takes to adopt someone so different from them and make them a part of their family.  Excellent movie and Kuddos for the REAL family that made this happen for this special young man.  Motivates us all to be better people...especially those of us who claim Jesus Christ as our Lord and Savior like this family does.  If we all reached out to just one...what a different world we might live in.
B001GCUO5M|5.0|Not to give anything away, but my husband and I talked about the final twist all the way home.  The movie was claustophobic, unnerving, and completely effective.  The acting--especially Leonardo diCaprio's--was excellent.  I recommend it highly.
0812550706|5.0|Ender's Game was simply amazing. I had my doubts and put off reading this book for the longest time. Hardcore science fiction is hit or miss for me, but from the very first chapter I knew Ender's Game was going to be phenomenal.<br /><br />Since Ender is a genius, he speaks like an adult. I had to constantly remind myself he was only between the ages of 6 and 11 for the bulk of the book. The same went for all of the children, in a lesser degree. It wasn't annoying. If anything, it made his situation seem more realistic always having to force myself to think of him as a child.<br /><br />Books about aliens are usually more miss than hit for me, but Ender's Game focused almost solely on humankind. Ender and the other children's time at battle school and commander school was made to feel realistic by showing a completion between them. Ender always being one of the kids, but apart from them could be easily compared to a any everyday situation of the outcast kid at school. Ender considering the adults to be against him or toying with him can also be translated into real life.<br /><br />While I saw many messages throughout the novel, none took over. The book never because a form of propaganda, which I thoroughly appreciated. More than anything else, this book was Ender's story. You rejoiced at his accomplishments and fretted over his well-being. By the end of the book, he was very real to me. He had become my friend and my hero. Ender's Game is an extraordinary book.
B001VLXNLU|4.0|I will agree with some of the other reviews that the characters in this book are cliche. However, I found the book to be a light and fun read.

B001S86J2Q|3.0|This movie is about an Italian guy that falls in love with a girl who is very reserved in her sexual prowess. Her dull style creates a lot of tension between her and her Italian lover and they have an on again off again relationship during their final year of high school. Finally, in the end, she is shattered by her lovers disinterest and desire to have intimacy in their relationship. She decides to put on airs instead of being who she feels comfortable being. I was surprised the film ended on this note as it does not sent a great message to adolescents. The music is very catchy.

B000YDOOU0|5.0|This album is ostensibly very similar in concept to, say, Metheny's Trio 99->00 album, but yet it's not the same. I find this recording to sound fresher, more uplifting, more energetic, more clearly and crisply captured.    The compositions, as another reviewer mentioned, don't strike me as very memorable. I would generally find that to be a point of flaw, but in this case, the improvisations and chord changes are so pleasant to listen to that I don't really miss superb head melodies.    If you've already got some similar recordings from Metheny, you might not feel a desire to get this one too, but then again, you might be surprised.
B000CRQX34|3.0|This entry in the King Arthur mythos plays more like a comedy. Set in England in 932 AD. It's just a flesh wound...
B0036EBARO|5.0|Artists like Kylie Minogue, Madonna & Goldfrapp paved the way for a sound that is hopefully returning.  Lady Gaga and Kesha have made electronic/dance music hip again.  Hopefully this album won't sound too dated for the hipsters of today.  All this lounging around (lounges seemed to have replaced dance clubs) the past few years.  We need to get up and dance again!  I personally am beyond words for this beginning to end masterpiece!  I didn't expect it after the dreamy subdued \\"Seventh Tree\\" album.  This is the best of the genre since Madonna's \\"Ray of Light\\"!  I hope it catches on.  Over the past fifty years new genre's have sprung up every five or so years.  By the mid nineties we got lost in a remix haze and failed to come up with new sounds.  So in this retro music world we now live in (almost everything out is based on a dated genre)this should work.  This album is like a love song to Abba, ELO, ONJ, Giorgio Moroder (Donna Summer) and countless artists of yesteryear who pushed the electronic envelope.  Thank you Goldfrapp! I will be getting tickets when you come to town.

B002VECM6S|5.0|The Blind Side is a real-life story of Michael Oher.  Quinton Aaron plays Michael Oher, a big lumbering Black youth, who has little in life.  A caring, kind, generous family, the well-to-do Tuohy's, adopted the homeless teen.  This is a wonderful story about family, football, and fighting the odds against you.<br /><br />\\"Big Mike\\", the homeless teen knows little of his mother, but much about the streets and projects of Memphis.  All he remembers of his childhood is traumatic and sad, but he is a good person and does not expect much, if anything of others.  A well-to-do Leigh Anne Tuohy (Sandra Bullock) sees him walking in the rain and cold one night, and takes him in, although somewhat wary about whether he would rob and run.  He shows his good character, and slowly but surely becomes a part of their family.  Leigh Anne wants to know his family and finds his mother, who is ashamed of how she turned out.  Over a period of time and lessons learned, the Tuohy's adopt Michael and he changes their lives, as they help him change his.  Both the Touhly children are bright - SJ is fun to watch as he helps Michael practice football moves.<br /><br />Michael becomes a top-notch football star as well as an excellent student hitting the Dean's list.  It is one of Sandra's best roles -and Quinton Aaron's straight-forward way keeps the film from going overboard on the sentimental.<br /><br />The Blind Side is based very much on the true story, and is indeed inspiring and remarkable.
B001B6EAOY|5.0|I ordered this specifically because my friend ordered one from a proper retail seller, and has had it working for well over a year and no issues. I used my own MicroSD cards in his adapter and in my PSP and it had no trouble recognizing it. It was a little slow with two 8 gigs, but I believe that's more the PSP's fault or the cameras or whatever you use it in.     I pulled this off amazon from eTECH for it's cheap pricing. And that's exactly what this company delivered me. A cheap, and WRONG adapter. It was completely not what I ordered. After returning the wrong item and having my first mail answered somewhat quickly, they sent me a new one. This time it was broken. The second slot is pushed under the first, very noticeable under a easy visual inspection. Heck, you could notice it from inside the packaging. I'm going to have my friends try and fix it, since I don't want to return it and get another wrong or broken item from them.    I have no intention of ordering from this seller again, and I'd advise anyone else not to as well. They still have yet to answer my second email.
B002YIHO7I|5.0|The singer who is easily the most recognizable and most-played vocal artist on radio for three decades and who has been the poster child of our genre since it's inception, is poised for the release of her first album in ten years! Her 2000 release, LOVER'S ROCK sold 3.9 million copies in the U.S. Yes, Sade Adu has regrouped the band that bears her name, and SOLDIER OF LOVE is due for release on February 8th. The first single is the title track and it is marching its way straight up the charts. The groove is rich and compelling and the lyrics are deep and drenched with experience of love, which as we know is often a battlefield, hence this evocative line \\"I'm at the borderline of my faith, I'm at the hinterland of my devotion... in the frontline of this battle of mine... but I'm still alive.\\" Welcome back Sade... soldier on girl, we've been waiting a long time! ~Sandy Shore
B0026P3G12|5.0|Thank God this woman was found by that TV show!  This is the first decent music I have heard since I was a child.  She and I (also a middle aged woman) obviously have the same musical taste, which cannot be said of me and anyone else out there.<br /><br />I might like some songs by some artists, but I have never found an entire album as utterly enjoyable as this one.  There is nothing jazzy, no screaming, no discord, no overly heavy orchestra.  You don't feel like you're in a smoke-filled jazz club or a noisy rock concert. Her voice is clear and strong without being operatic.  The background music is sweet and gentle.  There is no annoyingly strong bass or treble to irritate the sensitive ear -- no jarring percussion.<br /><br />She is also not afraid to mix some beautiful, traditional hymns with some more contemporary songs, which is also my taste.<br /><br />She may think it's her dream, but it's also my dream.  I am so sick of turning on the radio and switching from station to station and never finding one single thing I can enjoy listening to -- except the religious stations where the beautiful music is unfortunately punctuated by irritating, narrow-minded narrative.<br /><br />Also, on the cover, she is dressed in a graceful, understated, flattering gown -- not glitzy, sparkly, overtight, or overshort.  She does not need to distract our attention with the visual, when the audio is so superlative.<br /><br />The lyrics enclosure also includes sweet, handwritten notes.<br /><br />This is an artist with real class.  There are no gimics.<br /><br />Just pure, unadulterated music.<br /><br />Brava!<br /><br />I hope she puts out more albums.  I am going to buy every single one -- if they're like this.
055358894X|4.0|It was a little slow in getting going.  The last hundred pages were quite good, but it took some effort to get there.  I will say that this was an original book.  I hate to read a book that feels like I've already read it somewhere before and this was unlike most fantasy books.
B00000DRXM|5.0|Whoa! Was I cryogenically frozen and stored in a cave for years to not know about the redos on Ozzy's first two albums? How did I miss out on that kind of info for all of these years?<br /><br />I just happened to be going through my old CD collection and found the 1995 versions and since it's been awhile since I last listened to them I figured I'd catch up with a couple of old classic albums, gave them a listen and then went online which I then read all the hoopla concerning the 2002 reissues and all I can say is, Wow, that's just nuts. Thank God I own the originals! - UPDATE: I just read that they will be re-releasing Blizzard of Ozz with the original bass and drum tracks added back to the mix the way they originally were recorded for the 30th anniversary editions of the album.<br /><br />Now let's go to the wayback machine and set it for 1982...&lt;Zeeeooop!> Way back in 1982, I had a friend who worked part time at a radio station somewhere in the suburbs of Detroit. I forget which radio station? But anyway, he would give me promotional albums now and then that the radio station did not want. Two of those albums were Blizzard of Ozz, and Diary of a Madman. The albums sat ignored for weeks in with my other collection of albums. I knew who Ozzy was at the time, and I'd heard some of his songs on the radio and liked them, but I never really paid much attention to the albums until one day when I was bored of listening to my other favorite albums of the time, I decided to give the Ozzy albums a try. Wow, was I ever glad that I did! I thought the albums were great, and I wanted to hear more, which eventually  led me to the awesome and legendary Black Sabbath albums, and...well, that's a story for another day.<br /><br />So these albums have a long history with me. And to now find out that Ozzy and Sharon have tampered with their greatness is just kind of shocking to me. Out of curiousity I will definitely have to give some of the 2002 reissued songs a listen when I get the chance to.<br /><br />Anywhoo...I really like this collection of songs. It is Ozzy's very first solo album after his departure with Black Sabbath, and it showed a lot of promise. It features some cool songs, two or three of which receive a fair amount of radio airplay, and the others are all really good as well.<br /><br />There's not much more I can add. It's a very, very good Heavy Metal classic album that any fan of this kind of music will enjoy, so get it if you don't already have it. Just make sure you get the 1995 version.<br /><br />Standout Tracks are: I Don't Know, Crazy Train, Mr. Crowley, and Revelation (Mother Earth)...I really like this collection of songs.

B0036B8MZU|5.0|If you like Gladiator, 300 and other similar movies of the genre, then you might enjoy this new series.  I admit I after watching the first couple of episodes, I was not sold.  The special affects were not the same par as Gladiator or 300, but then again, those were movie budgets.  After a while, you get used to and enjoy the stylized blood scenes of Spartacus.  But what sold me was the character development.  They are not shallow characters, each character has their own hopes and agenda.  Everyone is stabbing each other in the back trying to survive in that brutal world.  It is very gritty, unlike anything that is on TV right now.    I recommend this series if you are an action fan who does not mind the stylized violence, nudity and constant foul language which is well done in the context of the story.  I eagerly await season two, but that is delayed when I read about the lead actor who got sick.    I will purchase the Blue Ray version of this.  I am currently watching on Netflix since don't have Starz channel.
B0030MM68O|3.0|The movie was completely overrated.  It was ok, a little bit cheesy when they hit the soliloquies. I don't get the whole Oscar thing.  It just wasn't that good.  It's a Sunday rental not a keeper.

B002HREKCI|5.0|This book caught my interest from the first time I saw it.  I finally picked it up when I saw it at the library.  Within the first couple pages I was hooked.  They way the author presented this story was so real.  I could feel Clay's emotions as he listened to each of the tapes.  I wanted to reach out to Hannah and tell her that everything was going to be okay.  I've read reviews that state they felt Hannah was placing blame on those 13 people.  I never felt like that through the entire story.  I felt Hannah was trying to point out that a person's actions DO affect others.  Rumors, lies, bullying, etc are all ways that can cut a person down.  I think Hannah hoped that through the tapes, she could make someone (even just one) realize their behavior can change.  I was so raw in emotion towards the end, I needed to step back from the book for awhile and reflect over it.  You know the outcome of the story, but part of you hopes for that glimmer of help.  Something for Hannah to reach out and hold on to.  I hope this book becomes a must read for teens.  I think it has a very real portrayal of suicide and that things that may drive a person to believe that it may be the only option.
B002XMGGK6|5.0|I seen this movie at the theaters,great writing,directing and acting.This movie came with a well crafted mysterious ending.Definately my favorite movie for this year.a Great Mystery Thriller suspence.
1439153663|5.0|Summary:  Orphaned while onboard ship from Ireland, seven-year-old Lavinia arrives on the steps of a tobacco plantation where she is to live and work with the slaves of the kitchen house. Under the care of Belle, the master's illegitimate daughter, Lavinia becomes deeply bonded to her adopted family, though she is set apart from them by her white skin.<br /><br />Eventually, Lavinia is accepted into the world of the big house, where the master is absent and the mistress battles opium addiction. Lavinia finds herself perilously straddling two very different worlds. When she is forced to make a choice, loyalties are brought into question, dangerous truths are laid bare, and lives are put at risk.<br /><br />The Kitchen House is a tragic story of page-turning suspense, exploring the meaning of family, where love and loyalty prevail<br /><br />My Thoughts:  This book was fantastic.  It was the wow book that I have been waiting for all year.  I usually fall asleep reading at night, but not with this book.  I read well past midnight more than a few nights and had to force myself to put the book down and go to sleep.  I was torn between reading it every chance I got, and saving it so I had something to look forward to each night.<br /><br />The characters were wonderful.  The story was told by both Lavinia and Belle.  Through them we meet and fall in love with the slaves at Tall Oaks.  There is Mama Mae, who welcomes Lavinia into her adoptive family like she was one of her own, and her husband, Papa George, and their kids.  We also meet the master, and his family, including his son Marshall.  It is hard to pick a favorite.  Each one is written so well and plays such an important part in the story. If I had to, I would pick Will Stephens, who is the hard-working and fair man who managed the plantation for the master.  He allowed for some lightness and hope in the story.<br /><br />The voices of the two women narrators were perfect and gave different views to events as they occurred.  Even though the slave characters spoke in slang, their dialogue was clean and easy to read. Nothing ruins a book easier than dialect that is hard to read through.  That was not a problem here.<br /><br />In the end, I wish that the villains had been \\"taken care of\\" right away and that the characters that I had fallen in love with could have enjoyed their lives on the pages of this book.  BUT, I know that would not have been realistic, or as good of a story.  Life as a slave or servant on a plantation was not wrapped up pleasantly with a bow.  I am sure that the hardships that these characters went through were all too common then.  There was resolution though, with some hope for the future.<br /><br />All together, this was a 5 star book.  I still find Lavina and Belle and Mama and Will popping into my thoughts. I wish that it didn't have to end, but Ms. Grissom left me very pleased and wanting more, which to me, is a success.ters spoke in slang, their dialogue was clean and easy to read.

B002WIDRM6|5.0|I discovered this group on GACTV when I turned to this channel one evening looking for good melodious music.  I had been a long-time fan of Dolly Parton and Johnny Cash to name a couple.  Lady A's video to the title song came on and I was hooked by the song and the group.  Their very good voices along with the melody, hook and harmonies won me over almost instantly.  I have since bought this album and their debut album; I love both of them.  This sophomore album does them very very proud.  \\"American Honey\\" is a very different song and video; not written by them, I can see why they did it, as it fits their voices and style of music very well.  I highly recommend Lady Antebellum as a great recent group with a very bright future writing and singing melodious good music.
B0009A21R6|5.0|This is an amazing piece of audio engineering performed on an exceptional classic, timeless album.  I have heard all these songs numerous times in either CD (stereo) or on my iPod (256 kbps MP3) and it was like I was hearing this music for the first time when I popped this disc in my 5.1 system.  I heard sounds and guitar subtleties that were crushed in other mixes.  I certainly got chills on \\"Money for Nothing\\" as other reviewers have noted.  What great music!<br /><br />I can describe this album best as very \\"balanced\\" between the 5 speakers, and in no way \\"gimicky\\" like some 5.1 mixes.  When seated in the center of your room, you will feel sound coming at you almost evenly from each direction.  The mix never tries to purposely fade around or pinpoint a specific speaker just to show it is a 5 channel mix.  When it does, it is very tasteful (like to highlight a single iconic Knopfler fill).  The vocals and incredible, capturing Mark's gravely voice so clearly I'd swear he was standing in my living room!<br /><br />The only VERY slight complaint with this mix is that the center level seems a touch on the loud side compared to the other speakers, but that could just be an issue with my setup.<br /><br />This is THE ALBUM you want to buy and play to really show off the potential of your sound system and when entertaining guests.  This disc also plays in conventional CD players (like in a car), so it's a nice combo.<br /><br />It's a shame that higher end formats like SACD and DVD-A didn't take off, as this is a prime example of what could have been possible for countless other classics.  Maybe BD-Disc audio can save the day!<br /><br />**** For reference, I am listening to this via a Pioneer Elite DV-79avi DVD-A/SACD player connected via multichannel analog input to my Elite VSX-82txs AV reciever feeding Axiom speakers and a Hsu Subwoofer. (Modest setup, not \\"audiophile\\" but very nice) ****
0316044695|3.0|Let me preface this by saying i am very pro military. The U.S. military is an extremely capable and professional force. They are warriors with next-door-neighbor values. What's more, i'm in awe of what it takes to become a member of the special forces. i agree with Marcus' assessment that it's harder to become a seal than it is to become a harvard trained lawyer. thanks to marcus and especially his KIA team members for their sacrifices.    like others i felt the writing was a little ham-handed in style. And i was quite put off by the constant bashing of 'liberals' and the 'liberal media'. marcus could have made this point once and then moved on. ROE established by civilian military bosses exist for a reason. And the u.s. military answers to civilians for a reason. this is a bedrock constitutional safeguard. as a seal marcus would hopefully accept that and deal with it.    i was also a little put off by contradictions in the portrayal of the taliban. marcus constantly shifts back and forth between admiration and disdain for our enemy's skill.  i think their historical success at outlasting more modern military forces validates their skill and resiliency, and marcus could have left out the parts where he ridicules them. also at one point marcus states one of the biggest problems with Afghanistan is that everyone there owns a gun. yet i would bet marcus is very sympathetic to the position of the nra here in the u.s.    on a positive note the tale is very readable. i especially enjoyed marcus' detailing the rigors of seal training and the nature of the war we are faced with in afghanistan. and finally despite my criticisms of some of the book's content, i am very grateful that my country is defended by men and women of marcus' caliber.

B00337KM2S|5.0|I am not sucker to all the \\"Critically Acclaimed\\" films out there. Usually, I take the movies that have earned any Academy Awards/nominations and automatically label them as something I am bound to venomously hate. I was pleasantly surprised by \\"Up In the Air.\\" Indeed, it is not the feel-good flick of the year, but I feel like this movie has captured the current mood of our country's crisis with a solid cast and sharp-as-a-tack writing. I persoanally never felt depressed at any point in this fim, but then again it was a welcome relief from watching \\"Precious\\" the night prior. I highly recommend to enjoy this piece of cinematic heaven.

Featuring a wonderful cast and well-written script, this political-media thriller won't disappoint. I would have given it 5 stars if the ending wasn't so frustrating, but then I suppose how else could have it ended? Definitely not predictable and will keep you guessing till the end. Please note there are 6 episodes, with 750 minutes (12.5 hours) total so be prepared to watch as you can give it your full attention or you will be at a loss when trying to keep track.

B00267N3DQ|3.0|It is probably pointless to review the film Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs.  People with much more experience, knowledge, and writing skills have waxed rhapsodic about the importance and enjoyability of this film.  I will mention the endorsement of my 2-year-old son, however: this is the only \\"Princess\\" film he has ever asked to see.  Granted, he often picks \\"Cars\\" over Snow White, but he certainly asks for Snow White a lot.    No, readers of this review are likely more interested in the various formats and qualities thereof.  Here I can offer some insight.  This 3-disc Blu-ray edition comes with a DVD copy of the film (which includes some extras not on the Blu-ray copy, so make sure you watch them both).  I've had no problems with this disc, and it looks and sounds just as good on my TV as the Blu-ray copy (42\\", same sound system).  The Blu-ray copy of the film also worked fine, but has the same annoying problems that Sleeping Beauty had: if you stop the disc, you cannot restart from where you left off, but are instead subjected to the FBI warnings, Disney propoganda, and menu navigation to get back to where you left off.  When you have small children, they are not going to watch the film all the way through every time!  And they are going to play with the remote control, etc.  This is incredibly frustrating and is not a function of Blu-ray discs in general: my Simpsons Movie Blu-ray, for example, acts like a DVD when stopped and restarted.    The third disc contains extras.  The extras are fantastic.  No, better than that: they are FANTASTIC!!!  The highlights include an audio commentary by Walt Himself pieced together from audio recordings made in the late 1930s.  There are also lots of interviews and short video clips of other workers, including video of the director(s) setting up the multi-plane cameras, sound engineers discussing the relative merits of the echos in the men's vs. the women's bathrooms, and a promo film on Disneyland.  But best of all, there are included many of Disney's short films, most of which I hadn't seen before.  There's \\"Steamboat Willy\\" of course (the first Disney film to sync animation with sound), \\"The Old Mill\\" (first use of the multiplane camera), Flowers and Trees (first Technicolour cartoon and winner of an Oscar), Goddess of Spring (Persephone is often considered Disney's first attempt at a \\"realistic\\" human female character), and several others.  These shorts, and the technical introductions related to them, are themselves worth the price of the disc.    Unfortunately.... Disney's Blu-rays are almost too annoying to actually watch.  As mentioned above, pressing stop (or turning off the power on your player) automatically resets the disc to the beginning.  I have a PS3 player, with load times on the order of seconds (5 or 6 at most).  So it was with some annoyance that I pressed stop and then timed how long it would take to get back to where I was in the disc.  The total time: 2 minutes and 33 seconds.  This is not straight running time either - I stood in front of the machine pressing the \\"Menu\\" and \\"Fast Forward\\" buttons on the remote whenever I had the chance.  Two and a half minutes to resume a film after just pressing \\"Stop\\" to go to the bathroom is unacceptable.  Having to watch the FBI warnings and Disney ads AGAIN is unacceptable.  Is Disney trying to drive people to piracy?  Because that is the effect that technical issues like this will create.  Memo to Disney: do not punish the people who are trying to be honest and actually buy your movies.  (And I didn't even mention the fact that I had to update my software before it would even let me watch the thing in the first place!  Aanother hour down the drain...at least I didn't have the kids crying because they couldn't start watching it right away.)
B002VECMAO|4.0|Some stories are fake yet seem real. Some stories are real yet seem fake. And then there are stories that are supposed to be real but make you think \\"Are you kidding me?\\" That might be the case here with the film THE MEN WHO STARE AT GOATS. If nothing else you've got to love the title.<br /><br />Bob Wilton (Ewan McGregor) is an Ann Arbor newspaper man whose wife just dumped him for the paper's editor. Wanting to prove to himself and her that he's more than she realized, he volunteers to go to Iraq to report on the war and become, in essence, a man.<br /><br />But it isn't what it's cracked up to be as he waits for an opportunity to even enter the country. A chance meeting in a restaurant with a man he had heard of named Lyn Cassady (George Clooney) changes his life forever. Before coming to Iraq Bob had interviewed a man who claimed to have psychic abilities that he was taught by the U.S. military. And Lyn was the man he said was the best of the best.<br /><br />When Bob refers back to this interview while talking to Lyn, he is put off at first. But a drawing made in his notebook that resembles a tattoo on Lyn's chest makes Lyn believe that the two of them have been led to one another via destiny.<br /><br />And so the pair head to Iraq the next day, Bob in search of a story and Lyn to fulfill a secret mission he eventually shares with Bob. While en route, Lyn shares the story of the special ops group that was founded to use psychic abilities as well as other subversive techniques.<br /><br />The story begins with a solider named Bill Django (Jeff Bridges) who returns from Vietnam questioning why soldiers performed the way they did under fire. Given a grant and a paycheck from Uncle Sam, Bill went in search of alternative methods of gathering information. Lets just say he checked out every new age fad he could find in seventies California.<br /><br />From this gathering of information Bill puts together a group he calls the New Earth Army. Unorthodox doesn't quite sum up this group of soldiers who parade around with long hair and flowers among other things. And the top student Bill finds among these men is Lyn Cassady.<br /><br />Bill is attempting to create a super soldier; a soldier that will not have to kill unless he must, but who can use mind control to take out the enemy. Bill calls these men his Jedi warriors.<br /><br />As to staring at goats in the film's title, it refers to a time when Lyn was required to stare at a goat using his psychic abilities to kill the goat.

Bill is attempting to create a super soldier; a soldier that will not have to kill unless he must, but who can use mind control to take out the enemy. Bill calls these men his Jedi warriors.     As to staring at goats in the film's title, it refers to a time when Lyn was required to stare at a goat using his psychic abilities to kill the goat.

0375413405|4.0|Glad to have found this specific cook book on Amazon and at the great price!  It was a Valentines gift for my husband who is great in the kitchen.  From what we can tell, the book is fairly simple to follow and Julia Child's information is very informative and helpful.
B00000DQXA|5.0|The product was just as described. The seller shipped the same day the order was placed. I find Amazon vendors to be 100% reliable and are my first choice when shopping on line.
B00338QENI|5.0|Amazing. This book is well written and tremendous effort was put into bringing this story to life. I highly recommend this book.
0060751967|4.0|I felt for the charming Roman Draganesti, he was a gentle and misunderstood. All he ever wanted was love. Oh and he didn't want to look stupid... lets hear it for the damsel in distress. Great book I enjoyed every moment.
B0030ZOYHC|5.0|I've watched Evangelion numerous times on VHS and DVD but never purchased the set. When I heard they were remaking the series and putting them out with completely redone artwork, enhanced sound, etc. I was really excited (especially to be able to watch it in 1080p).<br /><br />I've been really happy with the result. The redone artwork and integrated CG is awesome, the sound is good, I have no problems with the scenes that have been adjusted. I can't wait for the others to be released.
B001FB4W0C|5.0|If you like watching supernatural on CW you will love it on DVD No commercials and looks soo much better!
B000N6TYLW|5.0|This is a wonderful season.  I wish there was more to watch.  Why did they cancel the show.  I could watch over and over.
B002LBKDYE|5.0|Everything about this documentary is excellent, from the topic to it's production.<br />It really opens your eyes and mind to the food industry.
B002SVBDYQ|5.0|Fits the movie...even if you aren't into the movies...it is worth getting!<br /><br />Amazing songs...different mood than the Twilight soundtrack, but still really good and worth having!<br /><br />Super glad I got it!  I had to have it when I read Phoenix Child's review.<br /><br />The Score is great too...<br /><br />See this review/description:<br />[...].
B003B13QQU|5.0|I'm so happy to have new music from this talented pair. Goldfrapp style is evident in this new album, yet the content is fresh and delightful.
0307271862|5.0|I  miss Wallander but I really enjoyed this and learned a lot about China
B001JNNDGA|3.0|I don't know that I could watch it again.  The agony that my Lord suffered because of my sin.  This film is very graphic and brutal.  Reading the Bible about the crucifixion is one thing,  watching is all together different.  I dislike subtitles.  I wish the film had been in English.  I would not have purchased the movie if I knew that the language was in Hebrew.
0061703257|5.0|A GREAT read!  There are so many twists and turns it will have you guessing how it will end until...the end!!
0393325172|5.0|I have to state that I didn't buy the book because I thought it would be like the movie. I really wanted to read the book as it had been recommended by a friend I respect. Having read this I purchased and read the entire rest of the series of books (YES, it is a series) which number 20 full volumes and one unfinished but published novel. The books, collectively, are widely known as the Aubrey-Maturin series after the two main characters, Captain Jack Aubrey and Stephen Maturin, the ship's surgeon. The books give a very accurately detained account of the lives of these two men serving in Britain's Royal Navy during the Napoleonic Wars. The lead character is based, in large part, on a real life British Naval Captain of the same period (whom my grandmother once told me is a distant relative) by the name of Admiral Lord Thomas Cochrane. It would be impossible to do the books justice in this limited space, but suffice it to say that once I started reading them I HAD to read them all. The writing is decidedly British and nearly matches the vulgar prose of the time in which they are set. The books are so well written, and so well depict that time in history that it leaves one imagining one were there in person. Magnificent works. You cannot go wrong in buying one or all of them.
B000JMKNV0|5.0|What a mind bender... I keep thinking about the book and wondering what was real and not real.
B000AJIF4E|5.0|This is the genuine article. You see it used in all sorts of documentaries and recording studios, and now you can take it home with you. Easily worth 5x the price and will probably last forever.<br /><br />This is the same hardware as the Sony MDR-V6, which is the slightly cheaper consumer version (non-gold plated plug and shorter warranty), so go for that if this costs too much. I own both and they sound identical.
B002OFWG7O|5.0|I waiting for this collection long time ago, i think is so good the only complaint is the video of time like this i really like this video when they throw the objects underneath the bridge is wonderful
B0036EBARO|4.0|I have been a long time Goldfrapp fan since the beginning (Yes, since 2000's Felt Mountain), and Goldfrapp has taken another sharp turn and decided to give a nod to the 80s.  It borders on the edge of brilliance and going too far back in time where you are confused which decade the track was recorded.  This is their most direct, straightforward, pop record to date.  It most closely resembles Supernature though without the cold, sharp edges.  The album is definitely a grower, it took me several listens to begin to appreciate it.  I understand that Goldfrapp do not want to repeat themselves, though I still find myself longing for the Felt Mountain/Black Cherry days.  This maybe not the most innovative Goldfrapp album, but it sure as hell better than a lot of pop music out there.  Voicething is the one track that feels a bit lost in the cohesiveness of the album though I am curious to see if they expand this style into a 6th studio album. Overall it is an enjoyable experience and would recommend it to anyone that wants upbeat, pop/dance music with some substance.
B000VKJ6VS|3.0|Lets get one thing straight.  The first album is much better despite what you read.  When it came out companies werent hiring companies to create positive review for free advertising to get people to buy the albums.
1423101499|5.0|Mythology is still getting young boys to pick up books much the way the Harry Potter magic series did.  The Library Journal lists this for grades 6-9 but I recommend for students in grades 4 annd up.  My 4th grade son and his classmates have been devouring the series.  Their teacher is stunned that all of her reluctant readers (mostly boys) are fighting over the books. The action and adventure of greek mythology in a modern setting makes it work.  But don't forget the girls.  My 11 and 15 year old also read the series and loved it, providing many fun dinner conversations.  Dad joined in and now its my turn. This is a series you will want to own, especially since library wait lists are very long.  My 15 year old said that reading the series helped her in her 9th grade English class studying Greek mythology.
0595440096|5.0|I just finished Still Alice and keep thinking about the book.  I've scanned dozens of reviews, most of which summarize the plot and the reviewer's reactions, but I haven't run across comment on two things I liked very much.    One especially interesting, and disturbing, issue Genova presents is the isolation of the dementia sufferer--everyone else has a support group, but not the patient her/himself!  It was fascinating to see Alice, who was at that point \\"still Alice\\" and a pro-active person, organize a group of fellow patients for talk and support. I hope that the medical community pays attention to the need that this highlights and takes initiative to create such groups.     I also was touched by the butterfly motif.  Alice recalled learning as a child that a butterfly has a very short life.  She found this distressing, but her mother told her, it is short, but what a beautiful life (not an exact quote, but close enough).  This is the only time that the meaning of the butterfly is discussed, and I appreciate that Genova doesn't keep hitting us over the head with it.  We are reminded more subtly--the butterfly necklace Alice wears, the cover design, the small butterfly at chapter headings.    A woman dear to me has recently been diagnosed with Alzheimer's, so the book had special meaning.  I see in my friend the denial, the anger, the despair that Alice experienced, and the book strengthens my compassion for what she is going through.
B003AYDPYQ|5.0|This is the most hard hitting show about an ordinary American man in civilian life which one could ever imagine.  I just sat there in total amazement from start to finish on what happened in this kick off episode for season three. We open with the ripple effects of our main character's drug manufacturing (meth) and they are considerable.  The young woman who died from drugs in the season closer for 2 resulted in her father mishandling his job as an air traffic controller so that two planes collided. Walt, of course, is trying to come up with one excuse after another for his complicity: he's a manufacturer, not a dealer; bad things happen so people have to learn to move on and survive (told to an auditorium of students no less). As bad is that there is now a sketch of Walt in a Mexican shrine dealing with death and two men, who remind me of terminators, are looking for him. Walt is also separated now. His cancer seems to be in remission. He's trying to go straight as is his youthful partner. I, for one, can't imagine him on the straight and narrow after all of this.
0811806405|4.0|This really is a great book, but since it is written for building both classical and steel-string guitars, I find myself jumping from section to section to find measurements, tips, instructions, etc. It doesn't really flow well, but it is currently my #1 reference for guitar-making. I also highly recommend Irving Sloane's book.
B002KGKH5A|5.0|Jack White is an outsize musical talent.  He does it all, plays everything, sings, composes words and music, produces. His first and most enduring musical act is the White Stripes with his ex wife Meg White.  Meg is not as big a talent as he is but what some people miss is that the two of them are incredibly in tune with one another.  This of course means that the two of them are in tune every single second making music together, either in the studio or on stage.  This is very, very unusual.  Most of these bands are only grudgingly together and snipe at one another as to whose ego should be stroked the most.  These two are not like that. They made this movie after Icky Thump as they played across Canada.  I've listened to Jack play with his other bands.  He is excellent with them too but I don't think he will ever find another band mate who is as in tune with him as this one. The two of them treat one another as equal partners wherever they are too, backstage, on stage, traveling. They often stated they were brother and sister before they were outed as ex spouses.  That would actually be easy to believe as well. They are an extraordinary act and to see them move across Canada as people and performers is a wonderful experience. They play all venues, small and large, in bowling alleys, with Inuit tribes, on the water. I must confess that when I was just listening to the White Stripes at first, it never dawned on me that they were just two people.  It is borne out in this movie that two people are just plenty to put on one heck of a musical show.<br /><br />Visit my blog with link given on my profile page here or use this phonetically given URL (livingasseniors dot blogspot dot com).

1594488878|4.0|While I've watched big screen adaptations of Hornby's books (High Fidelity, About A Boy) but had never actually read a Hornby book till Juliet, Naked.  Although the book looks a bit long (almost 400 pages in hardback!) it was well worth it.<br /><br />Annie and Duncan are in a relationship that is boring, stale, and a matter of convenience.  Duncan is a Crowologist (an expert on everything Tucker Crowe), but past listening to a few of his songs, Annie doesn't really care about Tucker Crowe one way or another.  Who is Crowe?  Decades ago he used to be an up-and-coming star, but abruptly stopped performing, writing, and recording.  Now, the only thing that fanatic, die-hard Tucker Crowe fans have are supposedly random sightings, and picking apart the meaning in his lyrics and performances.  One day Duncan admits that he's been unfaithful to Annie, and their relationship abruptly ends, although Annie is not as sad or heart broken as she thought she should have been.  In the middle of all this, she has posted a review of Crowe's latest release, a stripped down version of his last album, Juliet.  Much to her surprise, she receives an email from Crowe.<br /><br />Its not necessarily the plot that makes Hornby such a great writer, but the way he conveys his message, and the simplicity of his writing.  The book will definitely resonate with readers, whether it be through Annie and Duncan's complacency in their relationship, the regret that Annie and Tucker both feel for having let so much time go to waste, or the fact that nobody seems to be doing what they love to do.  This is one of the rare books I've read where I've finished and just sat around reflecting about my own life, and thinking about how I need to make some changes.<br /><br />It might seem like a light read, but in the end, the themes and messages conveyed are very thought provoking.  Great novel!
0393072231|5.0|Those of you who gave a 1 star review of this BOOK because Amazon decided not to do a Kindle release as yet: you're crybabies and you're not even reviewing the book, you're reviewing Amazon and/or their policies and doing this book a disservice. As to Amazon: you need to revise your reviews policy....
B002MBAJ4M|5.0|I've been listening to the Mule for about 10 years now and own most of their albums.  In my opinion, \\"By A Thread\\" is their best studio album since \\"Life Before Insanity\\".  This is likely due to the addition of new bassist Jorgen Carlsson.  While previous bassist Andy Hess is a fine musician, I never felt like he was the right person to fill the shoes of original bassist Allen Woody following his untimely death.  Carlsson is a much better fit for this band, as his aggressive playing and deep, blues-rock grooves closely emulate the sound of the original lineup.  Warren Haynes responds with some of his best songwriting and playing in years.  He seems to be attacking his vocals, riffs, and solos with more intensity on the heavier songs while he continues to pour great emotion into the slower tunes.     If you're a fan of Gov't Mule or heavy blues-based rock, do not hesitate to pick this one up.  I'm sure you won't be disappointed.
B0039UTDA6|1.0|I was so excited for this series to air!  Then when I finally made the the time to watch the first two episodes I had recorded on DVR I was instantly devastated to hear Oprah friggin Winfrey's unmistakable demon spawn voice and shouted,  \\"OH NO, they paid SATAN to narrate it!\\"  I immediately stopped the playback, deleted both episodes and then deleted the series recording from my DVR schedule.  WHAT were they thinking to have Oprah narrate the US version?  I'm pre-ordering the original BBC version now.
B000001ELD|3.0|In 1978, the four members of Kiss decided to pull a huge marketing stunt; each of the players would release a solo album to be released simultaneously on the same date. In his book [[ASIN:0879309822 And Party Every Day: The Inside Story Of Casablanca Records]], Larry Harris tells that Kiss had a distribution clause in their contract that any album Kiss recorded was obligated to shipped a million copies on the opening day, and while Neil Bogart and others tried to argue the band down, Kiss held firm. The end result was one of the biggest promotional catastrophes in record industry history. As the joke goes, it shipped gold, but came back platinum. Casablanca never recovered, but the 1978 Kiss solo albums remain in print.<br /><br />Does the legend match the music? Not really, as the albums are uniformly decent but not incredible. The four personalities of the band would occasionally combine to make classic rock, and they needed each other to bounce off of. So I may catch flack for this, but despite that previous statement, I think Gene Simmons is a genius. There aren't many bands from the 70's that can still pump out top ten albums in the 21'st century, and for an immigrant from Israel who came up from nothing, he has marketed his band (and himself) to a point where the music and the image is universal. Gene is the demon bassist, the bat monster of rock. That is the personality he cultivated, yet his solo album shows that in his heart of hearts, he really wants to be... Paul McCartney?<br /><br />The Demon had a soft spot. Who knew? Both \\"Always Near You/Nowhere To Hide\\" and \\"See You Tonight\\" play off soft harmonies and melodic guitars. Gene so wanted to get that Beatles effect that he hired two members of the Broadway show cast of Beatlemania to sing backups. On a pair of the songs here, he debates the personality he's created for himself. \\"Man Of A Thousand Faces\\" and \\"Mr Make Believe\\" both wipe off the make-up. And then, there is the over the top finale, as Gene goes full-on show tunes for \\"When You Wish Upon A Star.\\" Hands down, it's the weirdest thing to appear on any album associated with Kiss, and that is saying something.<br /><br />On the other hand, Gene was ready to make the rock and roll go all night. He pulls \\"See You In Your Dreams\\" out from Rock and Roll Over and pumps it full of big guitars. \\"Radioactive\\" delivers the kind of hook he's good for with singles like \\"Christine Sixteen.\\" And the lusty rock star known for his backstage proclivities comes out on \\"True Confessions\\" (featuring Helen Reddy?!?) and \\"Living in Sin\\" (featuring a groupie cameo from then gal pal Cher). They aren't the only ones invited to the party. Seventies stalwarts like Rick Neilsen, Bob Seger, Janis Ian, Joe Perry and Kiss compadre the late Sean Delaney are all aboard. \\"Gene Simmons\\" was not the best of the Kiss '78 solos (that award goes to Ace), but it does nab the blue ribbon for the most eclectic.tunes for \\"When You Wish Upon A Star.\\" Hands down, it's the weirdest thing to appear on any album associated with Kiss, and that is saying something.

B000H6SXLU|5.0|3/24/10         In Roberta, Ginger demonstrates her best dancing with Fred Astaire.  She is relaxed and confident (Possibly because Mark Sandrich did not direct this one).  Fred and Ginger prove that they can carry the comedy by themselves without too much support from rest of cast, although Irene Dunne and Randolph Scott render excellent proformances as the other romantic couple.         Ginger and Fred also sing and dance superbly in this, one of their best of  their 10 musical comedies.  Songs include Cole Porter's \\"Smoke Gets in your eyes\\",  considered by Fred to be his most romantic number.  Ginger has fun with a French accent (She could imitate most any accent and was a consummant actress.         Ginger Rogers and Fred Astaire's success as a team is mostly due to their shared enthusaism and fun in working together in musical comedies; they both were true professionals.
B000002G8J|5.0|One of the great Clapton albums.     Re-issues usually have poor artwork and no liner notes. This one is a faithful copy of the original.     Sound is great. \\"Backless\\", \\"Slowhand\\", and \\"The Road To Escondido\\" are my three favorite non-live Clapton albums.     \\"Walk Out In The Rain\\", \\"Tulsa Time\\", and J.J.Cale's excellent \\"I'll Make Love To You Anytime\\" are standouts, but not a bad song on the album.     EC fans, you need this!
B002XTXG1G|1.0|I H.A.T.E.D. this film, I tried to watch it three days ago, found it boring, then watched it yesterday and found it DREADFULLY GROSS, STUPID, AND OFFENSIVE and a total waste of time.  Comparing it to A Clockwork Orange is like comparing Mary Poppins and Madonna, yeah! they are both female. And Bronson and A.C.O. are both movies! That is as close as the two can be compared.  A Clockwork Orange is a cult masterpiece and a great example of things going terribly wrong and strangely right, where as Bronson is sick...Period!!!
B001CIPU3G|5.0|Shogun is the fourth release from Trivium. And what a release it is.     It is the modern heavy metal masterpiece in a lot of ways. Addingly, this album may well be the album of the decade.    Thrash metal is a very simple way to describe this album. I think thrash metal with the tastes of metalcore-and in some parts modern death metal.    In preceding 3 Trivium albums, Trivium have learnt and made good solid metal albums. But with this I think, they reached their ultimate peak. And I'm wondering what's next for them?    Every 11 songs, they all sound different and leave different tastes. All of the songs can be instant hits; although the band has released only 2 singles from the album. (Down From The Sky and Throes Of Perdition) All the melodies are quite catchy; at the same time they are all very-well written and complex metal classics. Melodically, they don't sound like any new metal band; but i think they sound like early period of mighty Metallica. And yes this band may be new Metallica. They have quite a potential and a lot of energy. Time will tell.    Lyrics are perfect. They are about ancient warriors and heros, philosophy, war, etc. They can be thought as modern poetry as well.     And the best comes last. These extraordinary well written guitar solos...Aaahhh, can any of the modern metal bands sound like this melodic, this energetic and this musically superb?    And one final thing. I don't understand the critics and metal fans who don't follow Trivium. Just leave your thoughts behind and just listen to any of the songs from this album.     This is where heavy metal should go...And this is the path of how to beacome heavy metal legends.    Go on Trivium...
B001MYIXAW|5.0|First of all, the movie is awesome, one of my Top 10 of all-time. Nuff said there...<br /><br />Now I'd like to comment on this issue with Amazon not guaranteeing wheter you get the original 'dumbed-down' DVD/Blu-ray subtitles or the corrected theatrical subtitles the film had in the theaters. THere's nothing like creating a crapshoot as to which one you get when you buy it. WOW, great customer service there, Amazon!!! This is an major issue for some people, me included. I ordered the Blu-Ray a year ago online from Wal-mart with the original bad subtitles. While I was waiting for it to arrive, I learned about the controversy on the web. So, as soon as it arrived, I refunded it at a Wal-mart store before I opened it, and have been waiting for a time when I could be sure I got the theatrical subtitles.<br /><br />So here's an idea, Amazon. Sell the original subtitled version for $9.99 and continue selling the theatrical subtitled version for $15.99. This would be a great way to show some consideration for your customers concerns.<br /><br />I can guarantee I'm not buying it ANYWHERE until I KNOW I'm getting the theatrical subs. In the meantime, I can watch it instantly on Netflix with theatrical subtitles.
B001XRLWPQ|5.0|Very well written and acted show.  I watched every episode when it hit television and I have watched the dvd many times since purchasing it!!  Worth every penny!!
0307269981|2.0|The book is exactly what it tries to be, a violent detective story. I had to read this book for a book club. We read non-American novels. I really learned almost nothing about the country in which it is set. The book absolutely was not for me. the main character seems as if she is out of a graphic novel -  superhuman. I am sure that many people will be and are intrigued by this format, I am not implying that the writing is bad in any way. Gratuitous violence just isn't something with which I care to spend any time.
B00337KM2S|2.0|hmmm I'm a bit confused right now cos I may be posting this review for the wrong movie. This one is about Up In the Air, starring George Clooney. I have a feeling this is not the same film that most other reviewers saw.<br /><br />This one is about a corporate American dude whose job is to basically tell people they are fired, in a way that leads to as little drama as possible. Apparently it's a job that pays pretty well, and also requires him to travel around the country from firm to firm. Now of course this lifestyle isn't really conducive to having a settled family and kids - unless you are interested in living a dual life - one on the road and one at home.<br /><br />Ok, so does this film tell you anything you don't already know? Nope, nada. Fair enough, but there are many classy movies without an interesting message that can still entertain you for 2 hours. Is this one of those? Not a chance. Nothing and nobody interesting or engaging.<br /><br />Work sucks. Working as a professional in America sucks big time - in the air or on the ground.<br /><br />If I had a job like that, I'd be with a different woman every night. One needs their escape.<br /><br />3 out of 10 and I'm in a generous mood.
B002T9H2LA|5.0|i like amazons selections and price,what bothers me is they take your money right now and it takes at least a week to 10 days to get your product.
B001GCUO5M|3.0|It was good for passing time, much more entertaining than watching paint dry or something similar. So can't complain.<br /><br />The so-called twist was telegraphed at the very beginning of the movie, which is OK, cos at least it made some sense. Much rather have a little predictability than some totally outlandish ending that is not supported by anything you have been shown.<br /><br />The general premise of this film is not too interesting unfortunately. Mental illness, illusions, effects of past trauma. Not very engaging. You do keep watching though cos you wanna pat your own back that your hunch in the beginning was correct, even though you hope it wasn't.<br /><br />The ending is not satisfying at all. Overall not an uplifting experience.<br /><br />5 out of 10
B002VECM6S|5.0|BLIND SIDE is a quiet little film, one of the type we usually see on Hallmark Hall of Fame on television, that carries a tender message without really offending anyone or challenging the mentality of the viewer.  It just happens to be based on a book by Michael Lewis who in turn based his writing on a true story 'the story of Michael Oher, a homeless and traumatized boy who became an All American football player and first round NFL draft pick with the help of a caring woman and her family.'  John Lee Hancock adapted the novel for the screen and directed it.  He scored a hit when he decided to cast Sandra Bullock as the brave society no nonsense mother Leigh Anne Tuohy, giving Bullock the opportunity to polish her acting chops to a fare-thee-well.  Tim McGraw is very strong as the husband/father Sean Tuohy and the two young actors who play the biological Tuohy children - Jae Head and Lily Collins - are equal to their 'parents' performances.  Quinton Aaron is the quiet pacifist Michael Oher who is taken into the household of a Southern family as an equal in Memphis Tennessee where racial bias still exists.  It is the transformation of Michael as well as the florid transformation of the Tuohy family (especially the brilliantly realized Leigh Anne) that makes this little film glow.  Kathy Bates makes a brief cameo as a tutor for Michael and Ray McKinnon makes his role as the coach credible. And the rest of the cast offer of a very high quality of support.<br /><br />BLIND SIDE is not a great movie, just as 'PRECIOUS etc etc etc' is not a great movie: at the core of both of these films are the moments of light that enter the lives a unfortunate youngsters who then radiate the lives of those who have the courage to believe in the equality of mankind.  They deserve our attention. Grady Harp, March 10
1401301010|5.0|This book is so badass and rockin! Anthony Kiedis really had a crazy life. And when I realized that, he was still 13. What a great book to know the history behind all of their songs. Now, if only Nick Hexum would write a book like this. And Mariah Carey would be nice too.
1423113497|5.0|My wife and I have been struggling to find something for my son to read that he could actually get interested in...since blowing through his Magic Tree House series.  He is almost eight and English is really not his mother language (just as he was getting started speaking, we moved to China for several years and has been playing catch-up since we moved back for him to start 1st grade.)  He loves TV and movies and so we've made him a deal, if there is a book for the movie, if he reads the book first, we'll take him to see the movie.  With the movie for the first book in this series just coming out, we figured this would be a great chance for us to try out this new deal we made with him.  This has been the greatest thing we have done in the last year to help give him more confidence in reading and find a greater love for reading.  He burned through the first book in 2 hours (yes, a bit too fast, but surprisingly he still got about 70% of it--his Mom is making him write a book report, so he had to re-read it so he can write a decent book report--then his mom will let him see the movie.)  He's also already burned through the second book and is working on the third one now.     Its funny that he complained about reading through other books, saying the names were hard to read or remember, but he's had no problem with this one.  It shouldn't surprise me though, he's memorized almost every dinosaur name there is and recognizes each one, so if children REALLY want to, they can read anything they want--it comes down to an interest factor.  I hope that these books have given him the passion to continue reading and open up a whole new world of books for him.      Personally, I have read the first two books too so that I can talk about them with him and make sure he is really understanding them.  In general, they are a pretty fast read, don't get dull very much.  I have heard others say that the characters haven't been developed well, but honestly, for the age group these were written for, I think its perfect.  Kids at this age can still have attention issues and I think this book does great at keeping the readers interested in reading on.    As a parent, I highly recommend this book to any parent with children in the 8-12 age group that are looking for some good summer reading for their kids.  We have the first three book, we'll be looking for the other two as well as other series by this author.
0374530718|4.0|Sophie's world is an enchanting story of a teenage girl who on one day, after school, comes across two letters in her mailbox addressed to her. One of them reads, who are you ? and the other: where does the world come from ? This novel, written by Joseph Gardener, is about Sophie's quest to find answers to the above questions, and also to unravel the mysteries that surround our lives in general. The mysteries I am referring here to are: who created this world/universe ? who created human life ? is everything in this world predetermined ? etc. She (Sophie) tries to unravel these mysteries by reluctantly enrolling in an correspondence course in philosophy. It is through this course - taught by an enigmatic teacher - that Sophie realizes the essence of human life through the teachings of the world's greatest philosophers.<br /><br />Sophie's World is a novel that takes us through various stages and developments in history of philosophy, and helps us discern the views of people who were instrumental in bringing about these changes. The book is divided into numerous chapters, but unlike other books, chapters here are divided based on the chronological order of the major events that shook the very foundations of the western world. Each chapter in the book explains the views and ideas of a renowned philosopher during his time or the outcomes of a major philosophical movement that was taking place in the western world. The ideas and views of all major philosophies are debated, and are explained to us as they are narrated to a 15 year old teenage girl in terms she can understand. Since most of the story revolves around the two central characters: Sophie and her teacher, our understanding and feelings about these two characters only increases as we read through the book.<br /><br />There are at times when you feel that the explanation in some chapters on certain topics is shallow, but I guess this book doesn't emphasize on particular philosophies, and is more of a \\"introduction to philosophy\\" book as the title suggests.  I particularly liked the chapters on the romanticists, empirical philosophers - John Locke and Hume, and existential philosophy.<br /><br />The author, Joseph Gardener - a gifted story teller , effortlessly immerses the reader into Sophie's world with his captivating prose. The entire book is written in third person, and for most part, it is a conversation between Sophie and her teacher. A book definitely worth reading for a better understanding of mysteries that surround our lives, and worth reading twice for those who will be taking introductory courses in philosophy.  This book definitely deserves the praise it has and has been getting so far.ophy\\" book as the title suggests.

B00005N6KG|4.0|After reading a lot of good reviews for these headphones, and needing some cheap headphones to wear when I'm walking, I decided to try these out. It might be because my head is oddly shaped, but I have a hard time finding the right setting for the adjustable sides and one side inevitable always sort of dangles out and I can't hear it as well as the other side. However, the sound quality is pretty good and they're lightweight and perfect for walks.

It is cute and a tribute to evil mad scientists everywhere.<br /><br />The supporting cast of Nathan (Firefly, Castle)  Fillion and Felicia day makes this DVD interesting. It looks like a throw back to a 1940 serial and musical too.<br /><br />The cast commentary track is great fun too.

B002XTBE6K|5.0|I love this adaptation of Emma!  Romola Garai is so much better at the part than I expected, she doesn't just deliver lines like Gweneth Paltrow did, she IS Emma.  And Jonny Miller is the most charming Mr. Knightley ever!  The lenghth of the picture does it true justice and you get all the wonderful details from the book, nothing hardly is skipped over, if you truly love Jane Austen's book, you will enjoy this adaptation.  My only regret is that it didn't last even longer than 4 hours :)

B0034JKZ3G|5.0|The Princess and the Frog was one of the most anticipated films of 2009. After Disney new management (under Pixar's John Lasseter and Ed Catmull) decided to reverse that terrible decision of stop producing hand-drawn animated films in favor of the all common CGI ones. Chiken Little was awful, Meet the Robinsons and Bolt were fine but nothing compared to the Pixar films which all are excellent. I waited long to see this film and went to see it the day it opened in theaters. I wasn't dissapointed, the film felt like a return to the 90's Renaissance with beautiful animation, good characters, heart and excellent music. I just hope this trend of quality will continue in future Disney animated films.<br /><br />The Blu-Ray combo pack does not dissapoint. It offers top-notch picture and sound plus a bunch of bonus features that add to the film value. The DVD looks pretty good and perfect for SD. It also comes with a digital copy. (for me is just a waste of money).<br /><br />The Princess and the Frog returns to the tradition of great animated Disney films delivering an excellent story, good characters and oustanding music. I totally recommend it. 5 stars. Congratulations for Disney (at last).
B000Z27HLS|5.0|I had never even heard of this book let alone a movie, but again I saw this on PBS television and sat to watch it.  As soon as I got my copy, I watched it again and it was just as good as it was the first time.  I recommend this one because it is actually really funny too.  Has some great humor.  I'm actually reading the novel now which I acquired through Amazon with their new Kindle for PC software, and the best thing about it is that the book was free!!      Enjoy this movie!

It was wonderfully done with all the humor of the original novels and yet all the chaos of the period of time involved.  I highly recommend this film for anyone who loves the period piece romances.
B00316DDWW|5.0|Very good sophomore effort by Karnivool.  I tried buying this at Best buy, or anywhere locally....didn't carry it, even online.  Amazon seemed to be it.  For a very underrated Australian band, this is a great CD.  There are many songs that could be hits on radio, but I don't see that happening the way American radio is.      I'm a big \\"new rock\\" fan, and this is right along the lines, maybe even a little different!  Worth the money!
1857885082|2.0|Not exactly a rivetting read, this is a rather repetitive of account of one social anthropologist's attempt to characterize the quirks of the 'English' character. While claimig to cover all bases, the emphasis is on 'suburbia' and, despite a struggle to avoid this, the tone is irredeemably middle-class.    The popularity of this book is difficult to understand, but this reviewer suspects that the appeal derives from a readership that is itself both anglophile and 'middle-class' in outlook. The expression 'ango-saxon attitudes' springs to mind!
B00280LYIC|5.0|Since I watched the movie of The Lightening Thief first, upon reading this book, i actually saw how much different this was from the movie.  Major plot points were much different, but none the less, this book included some very important plot points that could hurt the future movies in the series. Enough about the movie though, the book itself is very detailed and just a pleasure to read. Because the movie is so different, it was actually like a whole other story. I'm not complaining. Its a great book, I suggest it to anyone.
B001UV4XX8|4.0|I picked this movie up because a friend of mine said it looked interesting.  I read the synopsis and wondered how an entire movie would come out of this concept.  I threw the blu ray in and started it up.  I don't put spoilers in my reviews, because I want people to see and feel the movie for themselves, so don't worry about that here.  You're immediately brought into the lives of a seemingly normal American family, and this starts the story.<br /><br />As I watched the events unfold I couldn't help but wonder who is who and what was connected.  This for me was a good thing, as was the entire movie.  It felt different, the husband/wife team had to make a choice.  The best thing was thinking about what I'd do, but by the end of the movie I changed my mind and rethought some things.<br /><br />All in all I don't know why everybody is giving this such a horrible review.  Its not an action junkie's dream but it has its only flow and interesting material.  Also the blu ray looked very impressive, crisp and clear like always...and the sound was great!<br /><br />I would highly recommend this movie for a rainy day, even if its just a rental.
B0000250OT|5.0|Call me a purist, a Luddite, a teller of tall tales, but were it not for this triumph of digital technology, I could think of reasons that I prefer, to all of the iPods and digital downloads, analog recordings played on my Dual turntable with its Shure V15 top-of-the-line cartridge (at least it was 30 years ago, and I've heard the precious metal required for the stylus is no longer available).  But Sony invested huge sums of money in restoring Ellington's most popular recording (arguably his greatest triumph), uncovering new tapings and documents in the process--a project that would be unthinkable in the present era of plummeting CD sales, the end of jazz releases by major labels, the discernible lack of interest in jazz among the American public (coincidentally since Ken Burns' epic PBS series on the history of this African-American art form).<br /><br />The Columbia-Sony achievement of 1999 made me completely rethink my previous estimate of \\"Ellington at Newport '56\\" as an over-rated, \\"minor\\" Ellington addition to his vast discography.  But now for the first time you can hear the actual concert (the band took the Newport stage twice--early in the evening for a brief set, when 4 key members were not present, and later, for the marathon Gonsalves' solo on \\"Diminuendo and Crescendo in Blue,\\" at 11:45pm--with the seemingly impossible task of holding the crowd during a period during the band's history when Ellington's musical family was being dismissed as long in the tooth and even unswinging!  Now we finally learn that what we heard on the LP was only part of the concert and that limited portion was largely \\"reconstructed\\" the next day in the studio.  This CD brings you the entire, \\"live\\" concert in audio so clean and pristine it could have been recorded today.  And for the first time, Paul Gonsalves' solo can be heard in stereo--authentic two-track stereo.  (The LP was monaural, and Paul, moreover, was playing off-mic!)<br /><br />The disc receives many plays from me for a number of reasons.  Paul's solo is a masterpiece--a textbook example of a soloist staying \\"within himself,\\" resisting the urge to impress and instead focusing on \\"staying in the pocket\\" of the beat and communicating with the crowd for what was later headlined around the world as \\"the riot at Newport.\\"  Paul's solo is a model of subtlety in its ever-so-slight variations with each passing chorus--each increasing the musical tension while maintaining the audience attention--as well as the kinetic, irresistible pulse (as measured by the dancing in the aisles by an expanding group of listeners). But without a doubt the band swings harder on this occasion than the Basie juggernaut or any large ensemble captured on record. Much of the credit belongs to the locked-in, tight time-stream supplied by the team of drummer Sam Woodyard and bassist Jimmy Wood, a thing of sheer beauty and continual delight.  But it's also the ingenious call-response riffs Ellington has scored for the band behind the soloists and, not least of all, that Ellington piano.  Listen to his chords--the spacing of his voicings and the placement of his percussive attack--and listen to his unrelenting vocal encouragement in the background.  The Maestro is clearly having the time of his life, a commander-in-chief who is cracking the whip over a force that has sprung to life as never before and simply knows no quit.  And to think there was a time--especially after hearing Duke on several later, small-group sessions--with Coltrane, Mingus and Roach--that I thought of Duke's as being a limited, \\"composer's\\" piano.  Not after this recording (which in turn led me to check out the brilliance of some of his early work, including the fabled Blanton-Webster band).<br /><br />I see that this edition, released in 2009, has already been discontinued.  Not to worry.  In fact, you would probably be well-advised to stay away from an Import of a recording of such magnitude and perfection. Settle for nothing less thanthe 1999 American edition, whether the original copy or a later release of that singular, undeniable success.<br /><br />[If you want to hear more of just Paul--a fine graphic artist as well as a beautiful person and formidable musician who seemed to abandon Duke's side only when a bottle was near by--check out \\"Salt and Pepper\\" with Sonny Stitt and Paul Gonsalves.  The latter gives the pyrotechnical and frequently sublime, habitually dominating and \\"perfect,\\" Stitt all he can handle, but on \\"Stardust\\" the pair form a musical relationship as complementary as that between Gene Ammons and Sonny.]n, whether the original copy or a later release of that singular, undeniable success.

B001KVZ6G6|5.0|NOTE:  This review was posted to the 4-disc Blu-Ray/DVD Combo version of \\"Up\\".  If you are reading this with a different version, be aware that Amazon does this from time to time and reviewers have no control over it.<br /><br />\\"Up\\" is an enjoyable film that proves once again that Disney/Pixar can take an oddball story and make it entertaining, heartwarming, and endearing all at once.  The events are a childlike fantasy, with only a few dark edges around them.  The action, while fast-paced, is never too scary for little ones, and the laughs are many.  There is some intensity to \\"Up\\", with death bracketing the beginning and end of the film, but the tale told in between makes this easier to take.  Each of the characters has some depth to them, and we learn enough about them in the story to truly care and be drawn in.<br /><br />The Four-Disc Blu-Ray/DVD Combo + BD-Live version of \\"Up\\" is crammed from end to end with just about anything you could imagine wanting from the home video experience.  In this decently-priced collection we have a Blu-Ray disc of the movie, complete with optional online-accessible content; a DVD edition of the film, the \\"Extras\\" disc with \\"making of\\", \\"bonus materials\\", short films and more, all of it representing an amazing Disney/Pixar production.  I was pretty impressed with all the featurettes that explained where most of the story's ideas came from and how they were researched.  The Blu-Ray is bright, colorful, and detailed, with textures being probably the most noticeable effect.  The DVD scales quite nicely, still managing to render well on a player with upscaling.  Extra features include stuff for the grown-ups, such as an explanation of why the story ended the way it did and some alternate ideas that the writers explored.  Last, the BD-Live content changes periodically, and can be accessed through a computer or through a Blu-Ray player that is Internet-enabled (such as the Playstation 3 I used to watch this collection).<br /><br />If you missed \\"Up\\" in the theaters, you'll find this to be just as charming and fun as Disney/Pixar's previous offerings.  If you saw it in theaters and want to own \\"Up\\" at home, I have to say that this Blu-Ray looks just as good to me as it did in the theater, with the added bonus of a DVD (for compatibility) and extra goodies to enhance enjoyment of the film across the board.heaters, you'll find this to be just as charming and fun as Disney/Pixar's previous offerings.

1557048630|5.0|Full of sketches, paintings, and creative thought, The Art of How to Train Your Dragon is what every \\"Art of\\" book should be...  full of astounding art and insight.  This is particularly important in the worlds of both 3D and traditional animation.  This book, alongside others such as The Art of Kung Fu Panda, The Art of Robots, The Art of The Hunchback of Notre Dame, etc. is a great example of what it truly takes to bring such a detailed cinematic work to life.  It carefully sections out the designs of each species of dragon, the human  Viking characters, the difference in the dragon's and viking's environments.  There are wonderful excerpts from the artists and production designers about their thought processes. The only complaint I have is that I wish it had even MORE!  But as a freelance illustrator that is always my complaint.  The art is beautiful and the character designs hilarious...  you'll get a kick out of the Dragons of myth section showing the designs they didn't use.  If you love great animated film character and concept art...  buy this book!<br /><br />One quick note,  I have noticed a disappointing style shift in the more recent Disney/Pixar Art of books and as a huge Disney fan I would say they could learn something from the variety of art and character design in this and other non Disney Art of books.

B0035G1K7S|3.0|I can't imagine wanting to watch this more than once. Very few songs are played in their entirety and the documentary aspect of it seems very contrived, I found myself liking Jack White a little less after watching it. The ending (which I won't ruin) didn't seem moving, only weird and staged.<br />Another thing that is highly annoying is no scene menu.<br />I enjoyed \\"Under Blackpool Lights\\" much more but it's not worth the price it is currently being sold for so I guess my recommendation would be to rent this first and see if you want to own it.
B001UV4XX8|1.0|To be sure \\"The Box\\" is a movie one has to pay close attention to the dialog to get much from it, but what you get is only a little more than if you just left the sound off and the video for that matter.    I reminded me of a Hitchcock wanna-be that built up all of this suspense, they pull back the shower curtain and there is nothing there, sort of the Al Capone Vault of horror flicks.    I kept watching thinking this has to have a real point, or wait, there were no strings attached here but now there are enough to host a 100 puppets in a show.    This is one of those movies where you either hit it dead-on and I mean perfect or you miss by miles, they shot for the moon and hit Pluto.     In the end the movie has the exact same contents as the box.

B0016HNOXQ|5.0|The first two Portishead albums got me hooked in the Trip Hop style of the time. Artists like Massive Attack, Tricky, DJ Shadow were among those included. Enough so that I based my own music production around that sound. Dark melodies, abstract samples, heavy beats.     This third album takes that same feeling, mood and atmosphere and makes it somehow new from anything I've heard before. It has the same mood but much more musical and refined. I remember just looking for the next cool heavy beat and riff on the first two. This album is heavier with its beatless parts than anything on the previous albums.    It is simple when stripped down but what melody, riff or beat hasn't been done already. What matters is the presentation, tone and feel these days.    Portishead (re)PRESENTS
B00337KM2S|4.0|Synopsis:  Ryan Bingham (George Clooney) is a motivational speaker who collects his regular paycheck by traveling the United States and being a career transition counselor (read:  he conducts layoffs for companies who won't do it themselves.)  During his time spent traveling he talks about how glad he is not to have baggage per se (everything he needs travels in a carry-on) and how his big goal is to get ten million frequent flyer miles as a result of his travels. Bingham met another frequent flyer named Alex (Vera Farmiga) during his travels and the two pursue a friends-with-benefits kind of relationship.      Bingham is introduced to an ambitious young coworker named Natalie Keener (Anna Kendrick), whom has been hired to find a way to streamline the layoff process without involving much travel (much to Bingham's dismay because he won't get the miles).  Bingham convinces his boss Craig (Jason Bateman) to let him take Natalie throughout the country, as to show her the ropes per se.  While Bingham displays his typical callous demeanor, Natalie is shocked and saddened once the reality of her job hits her, leaving her disillusioned in what she's trying to accomplish for a career.      During their time away from the job, Bingham starts to miss companionship as a result of his time with Natalie while she starts to gain her independence.  And since their paths cross repeatedly, Alex starts to become more involved in Bingham's life.  Will Bingham continue to be the \\"lone wolf\\" he's always wanted to be or will he be willing to settle down?  Will Natalie effectively transition into her career as a remote \\"career transition counselor?\\"    There were people I saw the movie with that lamented that the movie wasn't more light-hearted.  All I have to say is that this movie was an epic drama with funny parts throughout.  After I saw the movie, I was left thinking this question:  What if one day, when everything comes full-circle and everyone could get what they want, will peoplereceive the things they really wanted or just what they convinced themselves they needed as life went on?  It made me think and for that, I chalk one in the positive column for not being mindless entertainment.       The movie deserves all the acclaim it's received and I highly recommend it to anyone age-appropriate to see it.

1439148953|2.0|I didn't love it. The biggest disappointment for me was that so many reviewers mentioned \\"The Portrait of a Lady\\" in praising this novel. \\"Portrait\\" is one of my favorite books of all time, so I was primed for an engrossing read filled with psychological insight and vivid detail.<br /><br />I don't see the connection.  The prose in \\"Brooklyn\\" is flat, the psychological insight is absent. The characters tip heavily toward the stereotypical (Mrs. Kehoe, Tony-the-perfect-Italian-boyfriend, Eilis's mother--who was done by Maureen O'Hara in the movie \\"Only the Lonely\\"), unless they're the characters who are just utterly one-dimensional and meant to do no more than move the plot along. The plot feels forced; the conflict that occurs in the last third of the book (don't want to reveal too much) made no sense to me, and I think that was because, at least in part, Eilis's supposed feelings about everything just never convinced me. She never became real.<br /><br />I can't, for the life of me, figure out what those who loved this book loved. I can only say I can't count myself among them.

B002VECMAO|4.0|Movie - 3.5    Before viewing this, I'd only seen a couple of trailers for the movie between its theatrical debut and now. The cast itself looked awesome enough and I thought it'd turn out to be a pretty goofy and screwball kind of comedy. After actually seeing it, though.. I'm not so sure what to think. Probably the weirdest movie I've seen since Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas, Goats is probably 2nd underneath it now. You would think a premise of flower-wielding, Buddhist-hippie-inspired, Jedi-proclaiming psychics as a military cover up would make for lots of laughs and quirky humor, right? Well what if I told you this wasn't some ridiculous, made-up story and that it was intended to be based on something true? I had a lot of trouble deciding whether or not this was a straight comedy, a satire, or a mix of the two. The characters are likable and well-portrayed by their respective actors, but the narrative never makes clear enough that this is something I should either be taking seriously or with a grain of salt. Aside from that, though, it's still fairly enjoyable. The script has a good deal of wit and the pacing is fairly steady thanks to Ewan McGregor's narration. I just wish I could say more about the movie, but frankly, I was never sure what the point was in the first place. However, the eccentricity and oddness in themselves do have a certain charm and might make for a unique viewing experience. This film is not recommended for people unaccustomed to the weird and unusual. But if you want something different and adventurously goofy, give it a rent. In fact, give it multiple viewings. I think this might be one of those titles that needs it.    Video - 4.0    Presented by Starz / Anchor Bay using the MPEG-4 AVC codec in an aspect ratio of 2.39:1, Goats looks good enough. The image shows variations in color vibrancy and sharpness ranging from drab to excellent, though is most likely a result of the photography (think Michael Clayton). Black levels and contrast are fairly well-produced revealing great amounts of detail as well in some of the closeup shots of the actors, and even some of the backgrounds, objects, and goats. There aren't any signs of artifacting or debris either. All in all, it's a good transfer, but nothing especially remarkable or stunning, even for a recent release.    Audio - 4.5    Although mostly dialogue-driven, Goats has a surprisingly buoyant TrueHD 5.1 track. Dialogue is clear and easy to understand, driving itself mostly from the center channel, but the star of the audio is in the musical immersion and slight instances of gunfire. While Rolfe Kent's score isn't as captivating as his work for Up in the Air, Goats makes up for it a little easier by offering Boston's More Than a Feeling in lossless audio. Along with that most notable of notes, I feel a lot of the movie is as enjoyable as it is because of the music supervision. The front sound stage and side surrounds do an ample job engaging the viewer and thoroughly reflecting much of the film's mood through its soundtrack. The instances of gunfire aren't very often and only happen for a few minutes on-screen, but when they kick in, it's actually quite robust. LFE levels, however, are a bit lacking, so don't expect much else other than some great rock music and a little shooting to work out your systems.    Extras - 3.0    There are 2 commentaries: one with director Grant Heslov and one with author of the original book Jon Ronson, a couple of featurettes talking about the back story behind the novel and its real-life counterparts, and a bunch of trailers. After watching the film initially, I desperately wanted to watch the making-of to get some answers. Problem is they didn't explain enough. I still find the story halfway implausible, but there's a part of me that wants to believe that there's more to this story and movie (a theme that's an important piece of the narrative, no doubt, and ironically is now causing me a bit of restlessness). The featurettes clock in at about 18 minutes, though I wish they were more detailed and in-depth.    Overall - 4.0    The Men Who Stare at Goats is odd, to say the least. The characters are quirky, the narrative is all over the place, and the logic behind it all makes an eerie amount of sense if you take some of the extra features' interviewing into account. The A/V presentation is commendable, though nothing truly outstanding. If you're in to the strange and unusual, you may want to give this multiple shots. It's definitely unique in its own brand of storytelling, but those looking for something more linear might have trouble putting this one together. Recommended.

0307271862|5.0|The reader is treated by the author of the ever-popular Kurt Wallander series to a sweeping narrative with origins in the mid-19th century United States and spanning four continents.  The tale begins in a little town in Sweden where a rare [if ever] occurrence of the mass murder of several inhabitants takes place.  The police are mystified until they arrest a local ne'er-do-well who confesses to the murders but then hangs himself in his cell.  Case closed.<br /><br />But little makes sense to a woman judge who was raised in the village by foster parents when she visits the town and begins to uncover various clues raising questions about the police solution.  She continues to ponder the why of it all, including taking a photograph of a possible perpetrator with her when she visits China with a friend.  Needless to say, this act places her in a great deal of danger.<br /><br />The story gives the author an opportunity to use his critical eye on a wide number of topics, as he is wont to do in the novels he pens, from the Swedish judicial system and how society has changed to events taking place in China, from Mao to the present day.  Powerful in its scope and written with Mankell's accustomed skill with an excellent translation, the book is highly recommended.
B002M2N9JI|5.0|a great album diverse in style  from the  catchy \\" bullet proof \\"   to the  heartfelt \\"armor love\\"   or \\"cover my eyes\\" with no filler songs  just honest songs people can relate to  such as my favorite  \\"as if by magic\\"       call it pop or electro or even synthpop  it doesn't matter its just great music          in this day of disney prefab and rap on the radio its good to see the singer/ song writer is still alive
1439157383|1.0|I am tempted to give this book two stars because it began well, and then I realize that the negative stars garnered by the ending brings the average somewhat lower. I am not opposed to books with unhappy endings, but I am totally opposed to books with endings that are stupid. A Q&A blurb in the back of the book stated that the author had chosen that ending because it was the only way to end the book in a way that was medically realistic. The ending was medically unrealistic to the point of being laughable. Curiously, the same blurb also stated that the author's own offspring hated the ending; the author insinuates that he did not enjoy how sad it was, but I believe she may simply be overlooking the extreme likelihood that he simply thought it sucked.    The characters for the most part were annoying and did nothing to inspire interest. Anna and Jesse were compelling, inasmuch as Anna is a convincingly confused and unhappy protagonist and Jesse is convincingly dysfunctional from years of being ignored. Sara, the mother, is just beyond terrible at being a good parent or even a good person. At every turn, she is insensitive and dismissive of anything that is not her sick child, which seems acceptable until you realize that there are two other children in the picture just as needy and deserving of love and attention as the sick one. It is made clear that she does not have enough of herself to go around, and you know what? That is just too bad. Those other two kids aren't going away just because someone's sick, and you better believe that with a lifetime of this to deal with, some effort at setting priorities has got to be made. Sara is also not even remotely grounded in reality; an excellent example of this occurs at the rare holiday the family isn't in the hospital. When breaking the wishbone from the Thanksgiving turkey, Anna is told ominously by her mother, \\"You know what to wish for.\\" As if one wish made on a wishbone will in some way affect the outcome of the otherdaughter's illness. That, right there, is sick and deranged.     Julia (guardian-ad-litem) not only fails to do her job, she spends most of the time she should be doing her job contemplating her ex, the improbably named attorney Campbell Alexander, who is average at best. Every time the story focused on their past, it began to drag, like slogging through marshland. Their relationship is boring and overwrought, and essentially boils down to Julia still being wounded by the breakup that occurred in high school, even though she is allegedly a successful professional woman who has had like a decade to get over it. In truth, I hate her for this; even if I could look past how terrible she is at something that is supposedly her career, I find it hard to believe she could still be so hung up on some loser ex-boyfriend from high school. Speaking of whom, the only thing interesting about Campbell is that he has a service dog, which he closely guards his reason for having. This is amusing at first but loses its charm long before the nature of his medical malady is revealed.     I've saved one character in particular for last: Brian, the father. I cannot speak to the accuracy of the fire-related scenes; but I am the daughter of a paramedic, and some of the parts involving this supposed firefighter-paramedic were ludicrous. No responsible paramedic would allow a minor to accompany them on a call, nor to assist in patient care as occurred in the book. Aside from emotional trauma to the child, the patient could completely and totally sue the city, the fire department, and very likely the individual as well. Furthermore, the statement that he believes his cancer-riddled daughter will recover, from complete renal failure and a lifetime of seriously damaging cancer treatments in addition to the cancer itself, because he has seen people awake from deeply hypothermic states and that is a miracle, is patently absurd. Any paramedic worth their salt can tell you that hypothermia victimsactually can, and do, recover in this fashion; the extreme cold slows the metabolism and essentially puts the person into hibernation. This is in no way comparable to cancer and renal failure; while people can in extremely rare circumstances go into spontaneous remission from cancer, renal failure is irreversible.     Nearly everything in this book lost its charm long before the end. I felt quite geared up for a stopping point at about the halfway mark. Everything beyond that point, and quite a lot before, was basically worthless drivel. I will grant you this; the author is no doctor and clearly did not listen very hard to any she may have consulted, but the horrendous inaccuracies contained in this book could have easily been avoided with a ten minute trip to Wikipedia and a serious reduction in wishful, nonsensical thinking. This is a book that pretends to perpetuate hope, when in actuality it peddles little more than false hope and fanciful ideation with an overly lavish sprinkling of melodrama and asinine finger-pointing.
0802798225|5.0|I came across this book by accident, and I am so glad that I did. Even though it is geared for a teenage audience I think adults will enjoy this book as well. The characters are so well developed, and you fall in love with each of them from the get-go. Alex and Brittany beat the odds in this book to have a strong and loving relationship. What I liked about this was the all the detail that Elkeles writes about. She takes you into a world that of gangs, and you shows the dangers that many young people fall into. She gives Brittany a personality that is unseen by her (Brittany's) friends and family. I think what made this book truly great was that Elkeles told each chapter in either Alex's or Brittany's pov. By doing that we as readers got to see inside the minds of the two main characters. I will be reading more from Elkeles in the future.

B0035V35PI|5.0|Raizo (played by Rain), an orphan, was taken to a secret ninja training camp run by the Ozunu Clan when he was just a boy. After years of harsh, even deadly, training, Raizo was brought up to be the greatest ninja of the clan, even one who would one day take it over as leader.<br /><br />While a child and through his growing-up years, he befriends Kiriko (Anna Sawai) and she is just as strong-willed as he is except where he lacks feeling, she has a heart and doesn't agree with all the clan teaches. When Kiriko tries to escape, Raizo sees what it truly means to be a member of the Ozunu Clan and from then on follows his own path to take the clan down.<br /><br />Enlisting the help of a Europol agent, Mika Coretti (Naomie Harris), together they try and bring the clan to justice. However, not is all what it seems and the Ozunu Clan has plans of their own. Led by Raizo's brother, Takeshi (Rick Yune), the two are hunted, and only after the swords stop slicing and the blood cools will a victor be decided.<br /><br />This movie is hardcore, man. There's really no other word for it. Total and utter blood-soaked craziness that reminded me of Mortal Kombat (the game). I was just waiting for a low, ominous voice to say \\"Fatality.\\" Awesome.<br /><br />The kung fu in this flick is intense, especially the swordplay. Those bladed fights were among some of the best I've seen, right up there with the stuff in Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon. Rain looked brilliant, his body and demeanor as hard as steel. More than once was I reminded of Bruce Lee in Enter the Dragon with the way he moved. The flashback sequences also worked well and really added to Raizo's back story and firmly cemented us in his psyche so we know why he fights the way he does, why he's on the path he's on, and what motivates him as a ninja. Well done.<br /><br />What I especially liked in this movie was the ninjas' mystique and their power, namely the part about them being one with the shadows and the paranoia those being hunted had with the dark. The idea of always keeping the lights on and bright was a great way to play this up. The ninja-morphing with the shadows was also cool, giving the impression that these guys, after all that training, have become something more than human.<br /><br />This is just one crazy bloodbath of a movie. Non-stop action. Amazing sword battles. Cool enough story to string one fight scene to the next.<br /><br />Ninja Assassin is the definition of a martial arts flick.<br /><br />Yeah, go check it out.

B001IBIQU6|5.0|As of this moment this album has not reached the 4 star average rating and I just don't know why. First of all, regardless of what you think of all of DM's albums after Alan Wilder's departure, you cannot accuse them of selling out or trying to be crowd pleasers (cough U2). Since 'Ultra' (1997) DM has made albums that reflect their state of mind at that time and their own artistic exploration and they don't follow any trends, so all of their albums have honesty and artistic integrity. However this decade (or last) has not been the best for them, their first album of the decade 'Exciter' (2001) was a low key affair that did not leave a lasting impression. 'Playing the Angel' (2005) for some reason was overhyped as the best DM album since `Violator' (1990), but I found that album (PTA) to have a lot of weak spots. That's why I was hesitant to get their latest 'Sounds of the Universe', even though I was impressed with their video for 'Wrong' I read all the mixed reviews here at Amazon and made me doubt, but I finally got it and it really surprised me, the best you can say about any album is that it gets better with repeated listens and this is the case with SOTU. Most reviewers that have written negatively about the album complain about the excessive usage of old analog synthesizers, and I disagree, I think the album has a very distinct sound because of it, it doesn't mean that DM is going back to their days of 'Speak and Spell' or 'Some Great Reward', Martin Gore is still writing great songs and Dave Gahan is finally coming into his own as a songwriter, they combine vintage synth sound but with their current songwriting techniques. The best thing SOTU is that DM finally got back to melody which they hadn't done so effectively since `Ultra'.  The songs 'In Chains' and 'Wrong' revisit the tortured themes that DM explored so much in the 90's. But the first surprise of the album is 'Hole to Feed' the first of the 3 Dave Gahan's written songs where he tries to do the Elvisstyle again but this time it works, the song has a rocking style and is carried very well by Gore's rhythm guitar. `Fragile Tension' is my favorite song of the album it is a pulsing song with very effective use of a guitar figure with a lot of reverb in the chorus. `Peace' the second single off the album is a great uplifting song, probably the most uplifting that DM has ever been. The great surprise of SOTU without a doubt is `Come Back' the second Gahan penned song, it's a very simple song lyrically but the arrangement is something I never heard from DM before, it has kind of a 60's soul quality and has the sonic sheen of a Phil Spector song provided by Gore's distorted guitar. Even the traditional inclusion of an instrumental, `Spacewalker' is their best in years; it could have worked great as the score of a sci-fi film. `Perfect' is another great song carried by Gore's guitar where Gahan longs for another \\"Universe\\". `Jezebel' is the only song performed by Martin Gore and as in the past (`I want you now', `Blue Dress') it's a slow song where Gore talks about his obsessions, this time in the shape of a femme fatale named Jezebel. The only problem I have with the album is a silent spot right after the last song and then the keyboard bridge from `Wrong' is heard and the nothing, who knows what they were trying to do with that.  The album has the most effective use of guitar since `Violator' it carries most of the songs without being over the top, the percussion is all programmed and is very subdued and low on the mix. The combined vocals of David Gahan and Martin Gore have never worked so well and they are almost equally present in all of the songs, maybe that's the reason why only one song is performed by Martin Gore by himself there weren't more needed. This album is definitely DM's best since `Ultra' and maybe with time, even better than that album which is a personal favorite, I strongly recommend it.

B002XMGGK6|3.0|Law Abiding Citizen is about a mild-mannered family man, Clyde Shelton (Gerard Butler), whose wife and daughter are brutally murdered in a home invasion. Shelton's lawyer, Nick Rice (Jamie Foxx), is a hotshot Philadelphia prosecutor with a 96% conviction rate. He tells Shelton that the evidence is too weak for a conviction and arranges a plea bargain with one of the killers, Clarence Darby, in exchange for testifying against his accomplice. Rice keeps his winning streak and Darby, the real killer, walks after serving a light sentence while his partner is sentenced to death by lethal injection. Feeling betrayed by the broken and corrupt criminal justice system, Shelton becomes a man obsessed. He lets himself get captured and uses his brilliant mind to orchestrate a series of vengeful acts from his jail cell (sort of like the Joker in [[ASIN:B001GZ6QEC The Dark Knight]]) in order to teach the world a lesson about justice, a lesson taught in blood and dead bodies.<br /><br />Without giving away any major plot points not already divulged by the DVD box art or Amazon's editorial review (which has some wrong info), Law Abiding Citizen is just utterly ridiculous and strains credulity, even when one generously suspends disbelief. The problem is that it's written by Kurt Wimmer, who after the cult hit [[ASIN:B001CRRAE4 Equilibrium]], went on to make the super terrible and idiotic [[ASIN:B000FGGE7C Ultraviolet]]. With flimsy character development and nonsensical plot devices, this far-fetched thriller handles story progression with the subtlety and grace of a sledgehammer. The setup within the first 5 minutes is an absurd and simple-minded way to justify the rest of the movie. Shelton, a brilliant inventor with a dozen patents, is at home with his daughter tinkering away when a loud and urgent pounding comes from the front door. He opens the door, two men rush in, bound and gag him and proceed to brutalize his wife. How can someone be so stupid? Being the talented engineer, you'd think he'd have some sort of advanced video security system, or at least think to look through the peephole before opening up the door. There is no explanation for the motivation behind the brutal and sadistic crime, how the investigation was bungled, or why Shelton was left alive. All this is glossed over.<br /><br />After the brief trial, 10 years go by in one camera pan, yet no one has visibly aged a day. Now Shelton sets his devious plans in motion, first exacting his revenge on the two killers, then on all those involved in the case. What doesn't follow is why Shelton devotes a decade to plotting this huge elaborate scheme, spending his entire life savings, setting up a shell company and convoluted finances when he could've simply offed the guilty parties over the years through covert means. Not enough development (actually, none) is shown on how this soft-spoken engineer becomes this obsessed madman bent on thinking he can change the system. There are enough plot holes and faults of logic for a herd of elephants to fall through. His evolution from peaceful family man with no history of violence to cold, calculating serial killer capable of gross mutilation, torture, and assassination is unconvincing. (You'll see two very graphic acts of murder committed by Shelton, one involving a power saw and another involving a spork). Instead, we just skip ahead 10 years and he's already a hardened sadist and unflinching murderer in his own right. The revelation at the end into his methods is ludicrous and too outlandish. It's all very Batman-ish. You'll know what I mean when you see it.<br /><br />Fans of MacGyver will get a kick out of seeing Bruce McGill (Jack) as Nick Rice's mentor, but otherwise, none of the characters except he and the young female research attorney are likable. This film ask us to make any emotional investment in the one-dimensional characters, so we don't care if they lived or died. I can only recommend this as a rental, or if you are particularly fond of Foxx, Butler, or director F. Gary Gray. It can be entertaining on a boring evening, but don't expect too much out of this far-fetched thriller. A thought-provoking drama, it is not. 3.5/5 at best.<br /><br />On a final note, this DVD gets points for sporting an environmentally-friendlier case design from Eco-box that uses less plastic. It's lighter and supposedly recyclable. Outside is a slip-on paper dust jacket.ler, or director F. Gary Gray.

Build your business with a purpose, Systematize your procedures for success, and Plan every aspect of your business so it harmonizes with your ultimate purpose for your business.

0316069906|5.0|im 14, so obviously for me to read a book like this, it wasn't boring. it was incredible, its better then any documentury i've ever watched. the author paints a picture in his writing, so you can basically see what he's writing (but not too grotesque like it would seem), the author connects what he's describing to his life (like what food can mean to people) and he has an etremely interesting life. Foer asks the questions: what is suffering? and what is pain? and why is it ok to eat a pig and not a dog? and unlike what you would expect, he is completely objective (but obviously not so much that it is boring). this book is one of the best i've ever read, and yes it turned me into a vegetarian. some of my friends were scared to read it because they were scared it would make them vegetarians, and they wanted to continue eating meat in their ignorence, which is basically like thinking \\"if i stay not knowing im doing something wrong, im not doing anything wrong,\\" which obviously is a dumb way of thinking. so unless you're a pussy, or you don't like great books, get this book. ;D

They have been a great band for a very long time and I have enjoyed their music immensely over the years. Needless to say, it's like loosing an old friend you've known for quite some time, it just sucks to say goodbye. However, they probably do deserve a break after all they have given us over the years, so I wish them well!!<br /><br />This latest offering is indeed a very good release by these wise \\"old\\" men. It has plenty of hooks to keep you entertained and the song structures are in typical Scorpions fashion, very well put together. All of the tunes are excellent with a few stand outs such as Sly for example. What a beautifully written song with some truly amazing heart felt lyrics, it just moves you. If this is how they plan on going out?, well they done themselves justice yet again and I for one will most definitely go see them on this their last tour.<br /><br />Thanks for the memories boys, I truly appreciate it.

Leonardo DiCaprio does in Shutter Island, and it sounds wicked-awesome!<br /><br />DiCaprio plays Federal Marshal Teddy Daniels. His sidekick of a partner is Chuck Aule (Mark Ruffalo), and they are sent to the mysterious `Shutter Island' to investigate the disappearance of a woman.<br /><br />After she drowned her three children in the lake behind her house, Rachel (Emily Mortimer) was sent to this eerie island. It's an insane asylum for the kind of insane people that we love the most in dark and gritty films similar to this; the criminal kind. When she miraculously escapes from her cell, with a barred window and a sealed door locked from the outside; it's up to Teddy and Chuck to track her down. With a horrific storm on the horizon, they don't have much time and chances don't look too bright that she will survive. As if matters aren't bad enough on their own, Teddy is suffering from severe post traumatic stress from his involvement in World War II.<br /><br />The island is very much a huge character in the film. It's comparable to the islands of Deep Rising, King Kong and The Lost World: Jurassic Park. Shutter Island's legendary director, Martin Scorsese, brilliantly introduces the island to us early on in the film. It's massive in size and lurks in its murky waters, surrounded by a heavy thick `turn back now!' fog. It's introduced to us via creepy boat ride and is accompanied by a daunting score, every bit as chilling as those of The Shining and Jaws.<br /><br />As he has for years, Scorsese knows exactly what he's doing with the camera. He captures chilling images that pay homage to Stanley Kubrick and Alfred Hitchcock.<br /><br />The film constantly gets under your skin and makes you repeatedly ask yourself, \\"What the hell is going on?\\" It's not hard to follow; it's just bizarre and unsettling. It's no secret that weird things start happening; even if you haven't seen the trailer, you are almost suffocated with this constant vibe from the first scene to the last.<br /><br />The ending is the pay-off. I'm not going to say that the movie is too long, or that it's boring, because it's not in the least. But it is long and you are literally drained by the end of it. It just takes so much out of you. You're left with island fever I guess, and Scorsese has ensured that his island has bogged you down, along with his characters.<br /><br />The film takes us back to the 50s which is always a blast. It's creepy and disturbing but not over the top with the gore. It's cleverly written and I'm sure the novel of which it's based, has sent one or two of its readers to the Looney-bin. It's a fun ride and while it embodies several different elements we've seen a thousand times before (eerie island, insane asylum, post World War II, where'd the girl go? etc.); it boils all of them in a pot together, creating something very unique indeed. The film will surely only get better and better with repeated viewings.<br /><br />The acting is superb, and now that I think about it, the film is also resembles a videogame; Resident Evil, Tomb Raider and Silent Hill come to mind. There are several powerful characters that Teddy visits on his journey, that give him advice or a piece to his puzzle. Ben Kingsley is terrific as the doctor. Mark Ruffalo is very much like avideogame sidekick and you believe he'd do anything at all for Teddy. And Jackie Earle Haley and Elias Koteas play a couple of the island's mentally tormented misfits, astonishingly well. Jackie Earle Haley can be jotted down as a candidate for an Academy Award in the supporting actor category; a flawless performance.<br /><br />Having worked together on Gangs of New York, Aviator, The Departed and now Shutter Island; it's clear that DiCaprio and Scorsese know exactly what they will get from one another. It's pure movie magic as far as I'm concerned; they make one of the best Hollywood duos out there.<br /><br />Here's the first of the potential Oscar candidates for 2010.ey and Elias Koteas play a couple of the island's mentally tormented misfits, astonishingly well.

B001GA1RFA|2.0|I personally would not recommend this book. The ending was very predictable and many of the thoughts and actions of the narrator seemed very repetitive. I feel the book's theme and the narrators character had potential but the book itself did not deliver. The book book was well written aside from the fact it was very repetitive.
B0027BOL4G|5.0|This one eye opener.  More people should see this.  I have commented to many friends and family. Also I have offered to let them review this video.  I am sure they will find it open to what our government is all about.  I am sure they will mention it to their family and friends.  I will try to look at other documents like this.
B000KJTC5A|2.0|I watched this movie frequently as a kid and loved it so i decided to buy it, the quality on most of it is good but it seemed like they cut scenes from different versions so some of the picture it poor. i would not recommend this, i would look for a different version like a anniversary copy.
B002BSHXJA|5.0|The Beatles are for the ages. Barring military or economic catastrophe,  the Beatles' music will probably be listened to in 200 years and beyond, at least by a handful of music heads. Love 'em or hate 'em, this is likely to be true. Ongoing massive popularity over 40 years after they broke up is a good indicator.     When people listen to Beatles music in the future, nobody knows what the sound technology will be. We cannot guess what platform for the music they will use. It probably won't be CD's as we know them, but who knows? However, I can guess which mixes they'll be listening to in the year 2200: the original mono mixes found in this box.     I have been listening to the Beatles for about 35 years. They are not my favorite band anymore, but they were when I was a kid. Or maybe I should say they were not my favorite band for the past quarter century, but they might be now. Again. I had never heard most of these mono mixes, but the very poor stereo mixes that plagued so many Beatles albums were always annoying to me. I figured the mono versions had to be better. But I cannot believe how much better so many of them are. I can hear these songs, some of which I have heard literally hundreds of times, with fresh ears. Consistently this music just blows me away.     They put a great deal of effort into mastering these discs to the highest sonic standards, and you can hear that. But you can also hear the indisputable superiority of most of the mono mixes. It makes sense, because the stereo mixes were mostly done later, seemingly almost as a concession to the new technology. As I understand it, many of them were not even heard by the band prior to being released. These mono mixes give us Beatles' \\"original intentions\\" for their songs, as it were.     This box set is expensive, and I probably would have bought only a couple of the albums in mono had they been released individually. Still, I don't regret splashing out almost 1/3 of the mortgage payment for it. The mono box exceeded my expectations, which were already high. And when they foreclose on my house, I can still enjoy this box when I am living under the bridge down by the river. In spite of all the music it contains, it will still be small enough to carry easily in a knapsack, along with other basic necessities. I could never have done that with my old Beatles records. Even if I cannot actually play the music, I will at least be able to enjoy the fine packaging and remember the good times and fantastic sounds of the Beatles in mono.     So thank you EMI, or Apple Corps, or Michael Jackson in heaven, or whoever has control of these masters. You've given me back my Beatle fandom. This music is something I can believe in. Something I can take with me when I go. Music for the ages.
B001FB55I0|3.0|This fourth installment of the Terminator franchise simply isn't as good as the original \\"Terminator\\" or \\"Terminator 2\\".  But there are some interesting parts within the film, and some great action sequences.  The blu-ray itself has high-quality picture and sound.  There are two discs in this set.  One disc is the Theatrical Cut of the film.  This version also has the Warner Bros. Maximum Movie Mode feature (similar to the \\"Watchmen\\" blu-ray), which allows viewers to watch the film with commentary by the director.  There is also picture-in-picture features and a pop-up timeline.  Also, there are several branching \\"focus points\\", which allow you to pause the film and jump to a short featurette on some aspect of the film's production.  The problem is that there is too much waiting time in between pop-up segments.  You are often left waiting one or two minutes between each interactive feature, leaving you just watching the film.  A lot more information could have been put into the Maximum Movie Mode.<br /><br />Another disappointment is the second disc, or the \\"Director's Cut\\", which only features an additional 3 minutes of footage.  The changes made are barely noticeable, and don't add anything more to the story.  And just so you know, this set does not include the DVD version nor does it have a digital copy.  Overall: an average release for an average movie.

B001KVZ6G6|5.0|\\"Up\\" is definitely one of Pixar's greatest films to date.  As with all Pixar films, \\"Up\\" has so much depth and such strong characterization that it can be enjoyed by both children and their parents.  This is one of 2009's best films.<br /><br />The first two discs of this  four-disc set are Blu-Ray.  Disc 1 presents the movie, and picture and sound quality is top notch.  Also included are two short films, including \\"Partly Cloudy\\" (a brilliant short which was shown in front of \\"Up\\" in theaters).  Disc 2 contains bonus material, including multiple documentaries about the creation of the film.  Disc 3 is the DVD version of the movie.  Disc 4 is the Disney File Digital Copy, so you can download the film to either iTunes or Windows Media, and watch the film on a portable device.<br /><br />Overall, \\"Up\\" is a great movie with a high-quality blu-ray release.
1423119509|5.0|The shipment came quicker than expected, but the front left corner of the lid for the box containing the 5 books was torn.  A little duck tape on the inside fix the problem quickly, although the tear is still quite visible.  My daughter is on the fourth book already and I will soon begin reading the series to my son.  Very fair price.  Got to love that.

B002VECMAE|3.0|I'm glad I rented this film instead of just buying it on the   strength of the wonderful actors who played in it!---I would've been mad!  Don't get me wrong, for the kind of story it is, George Clooney, Jeff Bridges,   Ewan MacGregor and Kevin Spacey all did a very believable job in their roles,   and there are even a few good laughs here and there. But overall, this is a   very esoteric and self-indulgent movie. It's not bad, it's just okay.  Military intrigue, secret missions, mind-controlling, psychic hippy-esque  zen jedi super-warriors who can drop goats, burst apart clouds, pass through walls,  travel the world (telepathically) while lying in their beds or on the sofa,   and can even stun lowly hamsters in a single prolonged gaze!---WOW, really??  Like I said, it makes for an interesting rental, but buy it??--Not me!  I'd put this one in the same category as \\"Burn After Reading\\". (-:
0785116885|3.0|WWH Warbound is a book with rich color and a great artist, but Greg Pak appears to want to off his characters so nobody else can abuse them here. Shame really because these supporting cast characters appeared in the critically acclaimed Planet Hulk which was ground-breaking for the Incredible Hulk Series. If you like the supporting cast from Planet Hulk a lot, this may be a decent buy for you, if not, I would probably skip this book.
B0017XFP6S|5.0|\\"Lay It Down\\" has become Al Green's highest charting Billboard Pop Album's peaking at #9. Produced by Al Green, James Poyser and Ahmir '?westove' Thompson. Although you'd never could tell from the outstanding production (You would quickly think this was a Willie Mitchell production...But it's not!). There's not a bad cut to be found. This album should be a strong reminder to those who think DEEP SOUL MUSIC and/or just plain ole GOOD SOUL MUSIC is a thing of the past...THINK AGAIN!!! It should also be noted that Al Green is one of the FEW artists who has had several Billboard Top Selling Grammy Award Winning Gospel Albums to add to his ever-exciting career! Let hope Al Green, James Poyser and Ahmir '?westove' Thompson can hook up and do this again!
B0017I0KVI|5.0|This book is most enjoyable.  With Jane Austen's Emma, it maintains a true parallel storyline from the perspective of Mr. Knightley.  It enriches the reader's understanding of the background of life in the village of Highbury and the homes of Hartfield and Donwell Abbey.  This author enlarges upon scenes that were only mentioned briefly or assumed.  Characters become more dimensional with lives of their own.  Mr. Knightley emerges as having much more personality.  Just delightful!
B002XMGGK6|4.0|The large number of reviews here ended up confusing me more than helping me, so I took a chance and watched the movie.    This is a diverting crime drama that is well-paced, preposterously plotted, and well acted, except perhaps for Mr.Foxx. It is an expertly crafted entertainment that will please fans of action and crime. The one star reviews by people that expected more aren't wrong, they're just akin to a professional food writer reviewing a burger joint. For what it is and what it's intended to be, the film works and is a lot of fun.    You'll be glad you saw it.
0618918248|5.0|This is a fun read. If you don't believe you'll enjoy it, if you do then you should read it to see a different opinion.
B002HWRYJE|5.0|Okay, as a movie-goer, I remembered the talk about the Star Trek series becoming increasingly stale, which was partially justified with the 2002 installment that was \\"Star Trek: Nemesis\\". I did enjoy the movie despite how stale the series had become but knew it was the final movie featuring Patrick Stewert, Jonathan Frankes, etc from the \\"Next Generation\\" saga. I had pretty much felt that it was the end.<br /><br />Scroll ahead to 2009, and seamingly an entire, era later, news arises of an 11th Star Trek and felt it was worth checking out. I had no idea for the fun adventure that was about to occur. In addition, the franchise undergoes a complete makeover and a whole new cast comes in to usher in a completely new era for the series. So great is this movie that at age 27, I've finally become a Trekkie at last!<br /><br /> (SPOILERS AHEAD)<br /><br /> It is star date 2233 and a Federation Starship called U.S.S. Kelvin investigates an apparant lightning storm in space. Lead by Captain Polau, the Kelvin watches a black hole with a lightning storm around it when suddenly, a large, squid-like ship emerges from the black hole. Dwarfed by the mysterious ship, the Kelvin slowly approaches it when all of a sudden, the crew suddenly realize that weapons are locked on them and are fired upon the Kelvin. The rest is history...<br /><br /> If there is one perfect thing about this movie, I would say it was Zachary Quinto playing Spock. I was amazed at how well Quinto actually plays Spock, literally spot on. I don't know how they did it but if there was a perfect actor/actress role for any movie, this was it.<br /><br /> If all the Star Trek movies I've seen, I'd rank this as among my favorites, if not my favorite of all time. Definately recommended.
1563899426|4.0|Plot Summary:  Here on Earth there is an enclave of refuges from hundreds of kingdoms called Fabletown.  They've been chased from their homelands by an evil empire, and they live incognito on our mundane little planet.  Snow White is divorced from Prince Charming, and serves as the overworked defacto head of Fabletown's government.  The Big Bad Wolf has reformed from his granny-eating days, and he is the chief law enforcer, and the story opens with the Wolf's investigation into the apparent murder of Snow White's sister, Rose Red.      I was persuaded to try Bill Willingham's graphic novel series called Fables after I listened to his full-length book, Peter & Max: A Fables Novel.  I've always enjoyed looking at graphic novels, but I've never felt compelled to read one before now.  This mix of a contemporary setting and old-fashioned fable-lore has me hooked.  I'll be reading them all.    I feel the need to clarify that this is truly for adults in every way.  I thought maybe this was for the young adult crowd, but no, it deserves an R-rating for violence, language, and sexuality.  Yippee!  I just have to make sure that I hide it so my kids don't mistakenly pick this up, because the artwork is colorful and gorgeous.  It drew me in and made me pause throughout the story, but the naughty bits are for adult eyes only.    This is a fun way to pass an hour or two, and even though the price per copy seems a little steep to my cheapo nature, I have to admit that I'd be more than willing to reread these on some cold, boring evening.  The reviews also hint that these books just get better and better, so I can't wait to try [[ASIN:140120077X Fables Vol. 2: Animal Farm]].
B001UV4XUG|5.0|this is probably one of the most realistic love stories i have ever seen. first off, you can't help but love zooey deschanel in anything she does. especially in this movie, where she plays summer finn, a realistic woman who doesn't believe in love, who thinks believing in love is like believing in santa claus. and then there's her better half, tom hensen, who never thought he would meet \\"the one\\" until summer came along.     and the movie jumps from day one of their relationship, to the end of it. you get the idea how the movie is going to end when you walk into it, with the narrator (who sounds like freaking james earl jones for chrissake) tells you that what you're about to see isn't a love story, but a story about love. same thing? i think not.    the movie is essentially about unrequited love. it's about the missed opportunities. the things that don't work out. it's a comedy, but it covers all of these depressing topics. and that's what i like most about it. as described best in the showtime series weeds, a story can be intensely dramatic and depressing, but have inexplicably hilarious moments that coincide better than you would imagine.     it's a movie that's both emotionally devastating and hopeful. it reminds me of something of a cross between the movies eternal sunshine of the spotless mind and garden state. it's a rare film that displays completely fabulous acting, and it's not just your average love story. it doesn't have a beginning and an ending. it jumps in an indistinct order between the five hundred days of their relationship. and when their relationship is in its heyday, there's a choreographed dance sequence, not unlike the scene in the 2007 film enchanted. and it shows events in an incredibly depressing, but completely true-to-life way, where there's a split screen, one side, what's really happening in that moment, and the other side, what the character tom wanted to happen. and when we're in love, we find ourselves doing things like this.     sowhat can i say about this movie? everything is fantastic, the acting (especially the beautiful zooey deschanel), the writing, and the way the story is told, it's one of the best movies i've seen in 2009.
B0027BOL4G|5.0|I viewed this film with a group of like-minded people.  It was an eye-opener in some respects and a reminder of information I already had.  I was excited to find out the film had been nominated for an Academy Award for best documentary of '09.  The suffering of animals for profit is hard to watch; however, those who participated in the making of this film realize the critical importance of pasture-fed livestock gives me hope.  The reality of what McDonald's does to their beef before they package it is driving my family away from from their Drive-through.  Drive away, people, drive away.
B00337KM2S|5.0|In movies recently, American audiences are fed alot of crap, frankly. We get the inevitable Saw VI, Alvin And the Chipmunks: The Squeakuel, and other tripe that American filmgoers seem to flock to. Rarely are we shown a movie that shows people for what they really are, and life, for what it really is, and even less frequently do audiences actually acknowledge it. And, for this holiday season, which is more or less a dumping ground for Oscar nominees and hopefuls, we are shown a bright, intelligent, fresh, witty, hilarious, yet depressing picture from some of the best in the business. That picture, my friends, is Up in the Air.    Up in the Air features George Clooney as a man named Ryan Bingham, a \\"corporate downsizer\\", who goes from town to boring town, to fire employees, for businesses who don't have the guts to do it themselves. He's never had a real human connection in his life until he meets another frequent flyer named Alex, lovably played by Vera Farmiga, who showed real, gutsy, raw talent in the criminally overlooked horror flick Orphan, earlier this year. Alex shares alot of emotional stamina with Ryan, they click almost instantly. The chemistry that these two actors share is worth the price of admission alone.    Later on, we meet an ambitious young worker named Natalie (a beautiful star turn by Anna Kendrick, who had a brief part in the Twilight movies), who has an idea to cut costs by conducting employee layoffs from the internet.    After so many films a director makes, something of a trademark begins to appear, and Jason Reitman has his trademark down. And it's not a bad trademark like other directors certainly have. He has a knack for making emotionally relevant, and hilarious, yet deeply poignant and insightful films that are extremely watchable, and separate themselves from the usual Hollywood dreck that we're so used to.    His last film, 2007's Oscar hopeful Juno did kind of the same thing. It gave us that salty-sweet combination, and a lot of memorable dialogue. I could only imagine what this picture would be had Juno's Diablo Cody written it. But Reitman, writing alongside Sheldon Turner, whose previous credits include 2005's remake The Longest Yard, which I didn't particularly care for. As I've said, the writing here is witty, hilarious, and completely realistic.    Up in the Air is a very timely picture as well. Its major themes are corporate downsizing, and budget cuts. There's a scene in the movie where Natalie's boyfriend breaks up with her over a text message, and that's something that I know well, and I'm sure everybody else does as well. It brings up issues about how impossible love is if you're a member of today's generation, and that's part of what makes this movie so exciting.    Up in the Air is a difficult movie to describe. It's not quite a comedy, not quite a drama, and there's romance, but it's by no means a romantic comedy, or a romantic \\"dramedy\\". There's triumph and tragedy, laughs, and tears. But what's so amazing to me about it, is how closely it relates to real life. It's real, and rewarding, and a movie I'd certainly recommend.

0307271862|2.0|This would have been more interesting and less languid if had been written as the short story it deserved to be rather than a 365 page novel. There is little suspense and a very long interlude and flashbacks to what happened to the character of the title and how it related to the 20th century murders in a small town in sweden. Additionally, the author's views on politics in China get in the way of the narrative. Skip this one and go with the Wallander series.
B001FB4VXU|5.0|This is probably one of the funniest shows out there.  Just like the first season, every episode has at least one joke or event that will make you burst out in laughter.  Highly recommended.
B001P9KR94|3.0|The main reason this was purchased was because it won an Academy Award and that the Amazon reviews said it was visually stunning.   It, to me was not! This is actually more of a documentary, which is fine if you like Blu-ray docs, which I don't.  This is a real-life showing of the misery of the human condition, that can be found anywhere, but in this case in India. Unless I can directly do something about it I'd rather not watch it. Children have and always will be abused - as will adults - until the end of time.   The acting was not particularly impressive and over-all this movie just reminded me once again of how we treat each other.    If a human being of any age is abused in any way, by any one, does it make any difference where it is happening, particularly if nothing is done to keep it from happening again!?

B0013FYTA8|2.0|When I first heard Theory of a Deadman I thought it was a new Nickelback single.  Call me crazy but if you didn't know any better (me) you could make that mistake.  I thought that this album, like many current albums, sounds like the record company special.  There is nothing new or creative about this album or band.  I can't say that any song on this album captivated me at all.  Bad girlfriend is a feeble attempt at sounding cool and sounds like any of the other songs that are currently on the radio right now.     In short, if you dig corporate, radio friendly, nickelback-esk, Canadian rock groups than these guys are your new favorite band.
B00006RY6W|5.0|I don't have an SACD player yet, so I bought this hoping the CD layer was better than the two previous redbook CD versions I already own. Based on those two versions, I was thinking that CCR must have been recorded poorly, but Analogue Productions proved that thinking to be wrong.<br /><br />AP's CD layer is a HUGE improvement as it sounds much more natural without any of the shrillness or glare that the K2 remaster had, or flat lifelessness like the original Fantasy CD. It's not perfect, by any means, but it's such an improvement that I bought the rest of CCR's catalog from Analogue Productions. So now, not only do I have the best CD version available, I also now have the the SACD version for that day when I pony up the cash to get the SACD player that I want.

B001A4E1WS|5.0|Granted, LAST ACTION HERO (1993)  is probably aimed at pre-teen boys, yet it's a personal favorite. I'm one of this film's loyal fans.<br /><br />At the time it was making the theatrical rounds I worked at Sears Brand Central in their electronics division. We had a dedicated laser disc player that repeated every 30 minutes a selection of movie promos, plus Sears and other commercials. These discs were changed monthly.<br /><br />For a couple of cycles, \\"Last Action Hero\\" was a featured item. The ad included some fine concert footage of AC/DC's \\"Big Gun.\\" A portion of this track opens the picture's final credit scroll. Arnold appears in character during the Sears video while Angus Young does his famous schoolboy prance on stage.<br /><br />The soundtrack of [[ASIN:B00000297D LAST ACTION HERO]] is a metal or rocker fan's delight. It includes cuts by Alice in Chains, Megadeath, Fishbone, Def Leppard, Anthrax, Cypress Hill, Queensryche and Aerosmith. Tesla has the title track.<br /><br />The reason I'm particularly fond of this one is its references to classic movies, including Hamlet, in a fab b&w scene where Arnold as a grungy machine gun packing Dane says, \\"To be or not to be\\" and lights a bomb off his stogie. He tosses the TNT. Big explosion behind him and then a drolly given, \\"Not to be\\" ends the sequence.<br /><br />Best of all is Ian McKellen's take on the Grim Reaper from Ingmar Bergman's [[ASIN:B001WLMOL4 THE SEVENTH SEAL]] (1957). Honorable mention to Tom Noonan's horribly scarred axe-wielding villain. He and Arnold play dual roles: themselves the actors and their action film characters.<br /><br />It's a great concept: young Austin O'Brien (as Danny Madigan) steps into a movie and then he and other fictional characters cross back into the real world. That L.A. police station on the other side of the screen is great. We also get a holographic glimpse here of Arnold's Terminator foe in cop drag, and Danny DeVito provides the voice of 'Whiskers,' a cartoon cat detective. Also here, Austin/Danny I.D.s a confused F. Murray Abraham as Mozart's killer (remember [[ASIN:B00006DEFA AMADEUS]]?).<br /><br />At the video store, Sylvester Stallone is seen on a lifesize cardboard stand up display as [[ASIN:B00005N5S5 THE TERMINATOR]]. Jack Slater (Arnold) raves about how good Sly is in the role to a shocked Danny. It's too funny! Oh, and other bad puns, like when Slater kills a villain with an ice cream stuck in the eyeball, he quips: \\"Iced that guy... to cone a phrase!\\"<br /><br />Yes, I've seen LAST ACTION HERO many times and will many more!etective.

B002JWD6AS|5.0|I loved this book. It stands out from the stereotypical werewolf story because it has a few good twists and is highly original in the plot and characters. Instead of having to defeat some evil monster or terrifying threat the hero has to figure out a way to in a sense defeat a part of himself. Ultimately the characters are forced to mak ea choice as to whether or not they want to risk death to be together or not take the risk but stay apart forever. It is perfectly devastating and has several good twists to keep the reader enthralled in this beautiful story.
0800177975|5.0|Granted, LAST ACTION HERO (1993)  is probably aimed at pre-teen boys, yet it's a personal favorite. I'm one of this film's loyal fans.<br /><br />At the time it was making the theatrical rounds I worked at Sears Brand Central in their electronics division. We had a dedicated laser disc player that repeated every 30 minutes a selection of movie promos, plus Sears and other commercials. These discs were changed monthly.<br /><br />For a couple of cycles, \\"Last Action Hero\\" was a featured item. The ad included some fine concert footage of AC/DC's \\"Big Gun.\\" A portion of this track opens the picture's final credit scroll. Arnold appears in character during the Sears video while Angus Young does his famous schoolboy prance on stage.<br /><br />The soundtrack of [[ASIN:B00000297D LAST ACTION HERO]] is a metal or rocker fan's delight. It includes cuts by Alice in Chains, Megadeath, Fishbone, Def Leppard, Anthrax, Cypress Hill, Queensryche and Aerosmith. Tesla has the title track.<br /><br />The reason I'm particularly fond of this one is its references to classic movies, including Hamlet, in a fab b&w scene where Arnold as a grungy machine gun packing Dane says, \\"To be or not to be\\" and lights a bomb off his stogie. He tosses the TNT. Big explosion behind him and then a drolly given, \\"Not to be\\" ends the sequence.<br /><br />Best of all is Ian McKellen's take on the Grim Reaper from Ingmar Bergman's [[ASIN:B001WLMOL4 THE SEVENTH SEAL]] (1957). Honorable mention to Tom Noonan's horribly scarred axe-wielding villain. He and Arnold play dual roles: themselves the actors and their action film characters.<br /><br />It's a great concept: young Austin O'Brien (as Danny Madigan) steps into a movie and then he and other fictional characters cross back into the real world. That L.A. police station on the other side of the screen is great. We also get a holographic glimpse here of Arnold's Terminator foe in cop drag, and Danny DeVito provides the voice of 'Whiskers,' a cartoon cat detective. Also here, Austin/Danny I.D.s a confused F. Murray Abraham as Mozart's killer (remember [[ASIN:B00006DEFA AMADEUS]]?).<br /><br />At the video store, Sylvester Stallone is seen on a lifesize cardboard stand up display as [[ASIN:B00005N5S5 THE TERMINATOR]]. Jack Slater (Arnold) raves about how good Sly is in the role to a shocked Danny. It's too funny! Oh, and other bad puns, like when Slater kills a villain with an ice cream stuck in the eyeball, he quips: \\"Iced that guy... to cone a phrase!\\"<br /><br />Yes, I've seen LAST ACTION HERO many times and will many more!ed F.

0452289963|1.0|Somewhere in this book, Tolle describes in incident in a Chinese restaurant in which a man in a wheelchair goes crazy, and though he is not at all involved in the craziness  somehow concludes that HE, or rather, the pain-body of a woman he has just treated, is the cause of the madness. Just how megalomaniacal can someone get?<br /><br /> The Power of Now was a fairly good book, which I recommended several times to friends who were just starting out on a spiritual path. It seemed to me a well-written book by someone who had probably had a glimpse of his true self (as many of us have had), read some of the genuine Eastern masters, and was able to interpret their teachings for Westerners. A Good Earth is an altogether different story.<br /><br />Many of the reviews here, especially the one star reviews, claim that this book is Buddhism rehashed. It's not. Tolle uses to his own advantage that Hinduism's Advaita Vedanta, and in particular its foremost teacher Ramana Maharshi who died in 1950, is relatively unknown in the West, unlike Buddhism. How else can we explain the fact that everything he says in this book is virtually a paraphrase of Ramana's main teachings, regurgitated with his own interpretations?<br /><br />Nowhere does Buddhism speak of the real \\"Self\\" and the false ego superimposed over it. This is virtually trhe very core of Ramana's wisdom. Tolle milks these core teachings indiscriminately and passes them off as his own insights for gullible Westerners.<br /><br />Tolle expects us to believe that he was naturally \\"enlightened\\" without a personal guid; that his experience on a park bench was permanent, similar to the great masters such as Ramana; and that he had no need of sadhana. Sadhana is Sanskrit for spiritual practice. Usually it takes years and decades of intense meditation, that is, hours and hours at a stretch, to arrive at the state of permanent Self-realisation which Tolle claims (or wants us to believe in) for himself.<br /><br />Though it is theoretically possible for a Westerner - ie someone who is basically a stranger to Eastern concepts, and furthermore a person who has been seriously depressed and even suicidal, -- to gain Realisation, it's virtually unheard of without a master who is himself in that state, or at the very least spent years, decades, in a suitable retreat working on him or herself. The other alternative is years, decades, of selfless service to others --- hard work of the Mother Teresa category.<br /><br />Sorry, I don't buy it, and you shouldn't either. Better to go to the source itself --- but Tolle doesn't want you to do that, so he won't acknowledge that source but lets you believe it's close to Buddhism and it's his own. Some of us know better. I recommend  David Godman's [[ASIN:0140190627 Be as You Are: The Teachings of Sri Ramana Maharshi (Compass)]], which outlines  Ramana's teachings very well. But that's not an Oprah book, is it?<br /><br />Obviously, this book has done some good in that it has opened many people to their own potential, and that's great. But a teacher can only take you as far as he's gone himself, and I'd suggest that such inspired readers move on.ie someone who is basically a stranger to Eastern concepts, and furthermore a person who has been seriously depressed and even suicidal, -- to gain Realisation, it's virtually unheard of without a master who is himself in that state, or at the very least spent years, decades, in a suitable retreat working on him or herself.

B0035KGWR2|4.0|Every year, many British singers fill the shelves with new releases.   Amy is unlike many of those high-pitched dance divas. Her voice is pleasant, a perfect match to the melodies.     New album conceives a yet-modest Amy with new set of catch songs (but old riffs) and a \\"keep it simple\\" motto. It takes no risks and goes into a safe road, but it's probably the one that fits best with her persona. Just like you wouldn't expect Keane playing other way. The songs will often remind \\"This is Life\\" tunes.   The drumming beat sounds too alike and worn-out, but new album will certainly please old and new listeners. For those who expect to see a more mature Amy, this is not a challenging album. But I wonder if maturity won't take away the beauty of naiveness.

B002VECM4A|5.0|Clarisse \\"Precious\\" Jones's life is bleak and cruel. Precious, who lives with her abusive mother, is obese, struggles in school, and is pregnant for the second time by her father. Her first baby suffers from Downs Syndrome and Precious rarely sees her. When Precious is moved to an alternative school due to her pregnancy, her mother pressures her to get on welfare, but Precious is determined to make a better life for herself and her child. In the alternative school, Precious blooms under the guidance of a caring teacher and for the first time has friends in her life. Although others pressure Precious to give up her baby for adoption, she is determined to raise him and care for him, and her stubborn determination to hold on to her child as well as educate herself so she can be a better parent to him is heartwarming.     The acting in the movie is truly exceptional. Mo'Nique plays Precious's mother, a violent woman who feels no qualms about hitting her daughter or telling her she wishes she had had an abortion. Although she witnessed her boyfriend abusing Precious, she blames Precious for the abuse and his leaving her. The scene when Precious finally stands up to her mother is so powerful and so realistic, it brought tears to my eyes. Mariah Carey proves she can act in her role as Precious's social worker, and Lenny Kravitz shines in his role as male nurse to Precious. This film deserves every award it receives.
B001OQCV2E|1.0|Oh my word, this movie was AWFUL! Apparently, cliches strung together in a hapless mess are supposed to pass for a script nowadays.    Some of the cast really, really tried to act, bless them, but they simply couldn't fight back against a script this awful. And some of the choices of who acted what roles...I mean, would anyone elect a softly spoken gentle man you can barely hear as president? Should a comedic actor who can't do drama really be a dramatic lead? And should all the characters and most of the plot ideas be ripped off from other movies, even movies like Snakes On A Plane?    The timing was out...I mean, for instance, in the middle of an action sequence, where the hero has mere seconds to save the future of humanity, does he really have time to give his kid a long and wordy chat full of values and endearments? And as per usual in too many fantasy/sci fi movies, many of the characters had 'father issues'. Worst of all, two of the characters' fathers were killed, yet within minutes they are flirting and chatting happily. What the...? Sometimes this movie had 'after-school special' written all over it, it was so lame and cheesy, yet other times, it was so inappropriate I could barf. And as for the choices of who gets killed off...I mean, you could see it coming, and to avoid giving spoilers, I'll just list it as foreigners and people who didn't fit the conventional family unit.    Most of the plotting was so unbelievable I laughed out loud at its ridiculousness. The laws of physics, gravity, inertia and sensibility were all completely ignored. And why oh why, in the flying scenes, couldn't the pilots just have banked the plane UPWARDS instead of flying on and on at low altitudes through a painfully endless stream of falling debris, which for some reason all fell in slow motion, slower than the plane could fly, or slower than a car could drive or a man could run for that matter.    BTW, as I watched the movie, I began to suspect that it was being written by two writers, and that they were practising 'self insertion', living vicariously through two of the male lead characters. I mean, one of the characters is always right and gets the hot girl in the end. The other character is a writer who gets constant praise for his writing, even though he doesn't seem to me to be much good, and who ends up saving the day. These two characters are not realistic, they're more like mere characatures of who two rather mediocre writers might possibly want to be, if they could become heroes. I'm not sure if my belief is right, but I did note at the end of the movie that it had two writers.    Anyway, I could rave on and on about all the flaws of this movie. But I won't, because unlike the movie, I don't want to put people through pain and boredom for too many long hours!
B00012QLQ4|4.0|I agree with the majority of the fans saying that the Japanese Version with the english dub is probably the best version of the film (I haven't seen the VHS version) It seems the fanbase is really split.  Either they read the comic and hated the movie, or they didn't read it and love it despite the weird storyline.  From personal experience, I have only read 5 of the 6 graphic novels ( I refuse to pay 60 to 80 bucks for volume 6, so I will wait until January 2011 for it to be re-released) I love the comic, and I believe Mr. Otomo made the movie this way because, deep down, he knew he was never going to be able to successfully cram the manga into the movie.  So he decided to take it in a different direction entirely.  Did he succeed?  I think he did in a way.  Tetsuo comes off as a very real character, and this makes him the star of the film.  Kaneda's character is the biggest flaw of the film because it's difficult to get into.  He comes off as too macho.  The love story between him and Kei is completely dropped and crapped on.  These are the two biggest problems, but they're not the only ones.(Another reviewer labeled them) Akira doesn't even show up until the end, and, when you think he will, it's something else entirely.  Tetsuo said it best,\\"What the HELL is THIS?!\\" The truth is that I love the film.  Is it the greatest animes ever? No.  Is it in my top three list?  Oh yea.  This movie made me want to read the comics, and that might have been Mr. Otomo's intention all along.  I hope they don't do the same with the upcoming live action film in 2011.

B002ECJZ76|3.0|Not to be confused with \\"A Christmas Story\\", \\"Christmas Story\\" is the tale of a young orphan named Nikolas. Since the townsfolk don't really know what to do with the orphaned boy, they decide that each family in the village will house Nikolas for a year.  Each Christmas, Nikolas would be moved to a new family.<br /><br />Along the way, the young boy starts carving wooden figures and toys as a thank you to the families he stays with.  The local woodworker takes notice, and then the story really takes off.<br /><br />Shot on location in Finland (and the original language of the film is Finnish) the movie has a real North Pole look to it.  I knocked the film two stars because I felt it tended to wander at some points. Also, the English dub isn't so good.  Worse still: for those of us who enjoy watching a film in its native language, there's no option for Finnish with English subtitles.

B00386EZJU|5.0|Having not seen the movie yet (which I plan to), I am only writing this review solely on the album as  listening experience which is in one word: FANTASTIC!  I'm a big fan of John Powell's work and I think this is one of his best works in a long time.  There is a lot of replay value on this one.  There are sweeping orchestrations reminiscent of James Horner and early Hans Zimmer action scoring with epic choir and thunderous drums.  Standout tracks include:  \\"This is Berk\\" with it's Celtic influenced style,  \\"Forbidden Friendship,\\"  \\"Test Drive\\" \\"Romantic Flight\\" and the finale, \\"Coming Around Again.\\"   Any fan of John Powell will find a lot to enjoy on this release.  I have to admit, I was a little disappointed with the \\"Green Zone\\" score due to it's lack of thematic development, but this album makes up for it by leaps and bounds.  You won't be disappointed.   I've got it playing on my ipod as I write this review.  Highly enjoyable...

B0000042H4|5.0|Richard Wagner's Ring of The Nibelung is one of those works that is a dream and a curse for musicians the world over.  It is beautiful, horrid, contemplative, violent, and above all intoxicating.  Not in the sense of a drug but in the fact that it is a work that I will keep coming back too.  I first heard Wagner's Ring in the 1966/1967 live Bohm Ring. This is how I learned the work.  So I will compare the two and give my thoughts on them both.    Firstly, the sound of this recording is so sonically spectacular to other recorded versions that I am constantly in a state of awe at what John Culshaw and the Decca engineers managed to accomplish.  The balance between orchestra and vocalists is always just right.  Decca's microphones caught even the most subtle nuances that might not be heard at other times heard. This is not to say that other Rings are badly recorded.  Karl Bohm's 1966/1967 live Bayreuth Ring is captured in excellent sound from Philips.  However, the Bayreuth Festpielhaus and the Vienna Sofiensaal are two different locations.  Both have their merits and downfalls.  For example, the Sofiensaal can sometimes have a ring to it that sounds like someone has struck a bathtub and the Festpielhaus sound sometimes sounds boxy.     However, these are very small details that are heavily outweighed by so many great things.    Which brings me to my next point.  The musicians on both the Solti and Bohm Rings perform with a lot of conviction.  Both sets have the heaven-sent Birgit Nilsson and Wolfgang Windgassen in the roles of Brunnhilde and Siegfried.  On both sets they shine like stars.  Maybe the chemistry is a little more noticeable in the Bohm but the two have no peer before or after.  The other major roles are handled by some very accomplished singers.  For example, Hans Hotter is an authoritative Wotan for Solti, even if he is aged.  Theo Adam is an ambitious, younger Wotan for Bohm. Personally, I like Adam better than Hotter.  They are both great singers, though.  Gustav Neidlinger is Alberich in both sets, very evil and sinister in both.  However, I definitely prefer Gottlob Frick over Josef Greindl for Hagen.  Greindl is great, but Frick is superior.  His voice is black like the devil's tongue.  Supporting roles are filled out by some great stars and some not so great stars on both sets.  Christa Ludwig is Waltraute in Gotterdammerung for Solti (great) and it's Martha Modl in the Bohm (not so great.)  But Bohm's Rheinmaiden's are better, including Helga Dernesch, who was also a great Brunnhilde for Karajan.  Kirsten Flagstad is Kirsten Flagstad.  Even though Fricka is a relatively minor role, she makes it great.  Now for the orchestras.  The Vienna Philharmonic is great- very great. Roland Berger plays Siegfried's horn calls brilliantly.  I think that Vienna is the greatest orchestra in the world, bar none.  The Bayreuth Orchestra, for just a festival ensemble, is excellent.  Towards the end of Gotterdammerung, the brass is starting to suffer from intonation problems, but they have been playing for several hours without much of a break.  Cut them some slack.      Point three: the conductors.  Each has his own unique qualities.  Bohm's tempos are fast but they work really well, even in the Immolation Scene (which Mrs. Nilsson slows down somehow.) Bohm's interpretations are more along the lines of Strauss, who was a brisk conductor.  Solti?  Well, there's a reason he won 31 Grammies.  Yes, he is fast in Mahler, but not so for Wagner. Solti was a great conductor, period.      So, this is my take on Solti and Bohm. Personally, I would pass over the Karajan.  If I had to go to a desert island, I would take both.      Bravi tutti!
B00275EGWY|3.0|\\"Hurt Locker\\" just has far too many flaws to have deserved Best Picture.<br /><br />I walked into the theater knowing that many with military experience had been critical of its depiction of unit tactics and deployment.  Having served in the Army myself (pre-Iraq war) I was actually fine with that part of the movie as there's an obvious logistical reason for the way it was filmed - cost and the hassle of introducing more characters than were wanted/necessary to the plot.  If the director (Bigelow) had shown an entire platoon or more accompanying the bomb disposal unit she would have also had to introduce some of them as secondary characters.  So I gave a free pass on that count.  However, I take other vets word on the use of the suit and how the bombs were diffused.  Wasn't realistic.<br /><br />The combat scene in the desert is also completely wrong.  The insurgents take out soldiers at almost 900 meters with single shots using AKs!  Not just no way, but no freakin' way.  US soldiers are trained to take out targets with M-16s at 300 meters and not everyone can do it.  Hitting someone at almost three times that distance in one shot  . . . NO.  Not with an M-16 and not with an AK. Meanwhile, the US soldier firing with a high caliber rifle - something actually intended for sniping - has to take several shots before he can finally hit the insurgents.  That part is possibly correct, especially if the soldier firing isn't a trained sniper.<br /><br />Bigelow also forces her characters to do things because her plot demands it, not because it makes sense.  This is just bad film making to make such an error.  Example: The main character tells his wife a story near the end of the movie that would have caused any normal person, especially a mother, to react with some emotion and empathy.  But instead Bigelow forces that character to act cold and distant . . . which helps set up the next action by the male lead.<br /><br />How did this movie win Best Picture?  \\"Avatar\\" certainly didn't deserve to win either.  It's \\"Dances With Wolves\\" via CGI. 2009 must have been one bad year for quality movies . . . or, more likely, Hollywood was unwilling to buck their \\"need\\" to either be popular (\\"Avatar\\") or political (\\"Hurt Locker\\") and just go with a solid film like \\"Up,\\" \\"Precious\\" or \\"Up in the Air.\\"
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I actually saw the movie \\"Serenity\\" on TV before I even knew that it was first a canceled television show.  I liked the movie a lot and thought I'd check out the show.  Around the time I was pricing it, Amazon had it as one of their Gold Box deals - luckily me!  With the lower price and free shipping I couldn't pass it up (around $18)!      All in all, I really enjoyed the show and when I was finished watching it, I was a little shocked that it was canceled.  It obviously ended with the intention that they would be coming back for another season.  But with the movie it helps close some loose ends.

0440245931|3.0|I needed a book, and this was at hand. I kind of groaned, because I find Grisham very uneven in the quality department. But, you know, for 2/3 of Pelican, I was actively engaged, even though I had to suspend belief at some of the ridiculous coincidences. And even though toward the end, I felt impatient for it to get wrapped up, I'm still left with an overall feeling of being entertained.     I do think it would have been a stronger book if Grisham would have just let Darby do her thing without injecting a lackluster romance between her and Grantham. Zero spark there, and it added nothing to the story.     Also, Grisham seems to have this foggy sort of 1970s mind-set when it comes to his treatment of people of color. In this book, for example, the only two black characters are a janitor and a cop. Then there's \\"Khamel,\\" the middle-eastern assassin. Khamel? Jeez.     This review reads like a 2, but as the book did keep me entertained for much of its course, I'm giving it a 3.

B001FKKLNK|5.0|I am completely floored that there are only a couple reviews for this classic.  As the title of one of his earlier albums states...'Everybody Digs Bill Evans'  I can't even say it's an acquired taste.  Unlike single malt scotch, or dark chocolate, this hits you from square one.  From the moment I heard it, I was like, 'ahhh...that's it!!'  I don't claim to be a critic, but I've been blessed to recognize greatness.  It's as if these 3 souls merged briefly, then scattered, forever.  Bassist Scott LaFaro was killed in a car accident 10 days after these sets, but thankfully lightning has been caught in a bottle...trust me, this is up there with, 'Kind of Blue', 'Time Out', 'Birth of the Cool', or any of the other 'cool' or 'west coast' jazz greats.

He paved the way for several generations of guitarists who went further but owe him everything.    Now, for a man who died at 27 (what a waste ! ), what can we expect ? There cannot be that many outtakes, he simply didn't have the time; so this album is not more than that (like Saturn and First Rays) : the bottom of the barrell. But that's all we have, and of course there are wonderful moments, so any true fan must have this album just because there will never be another Jimi Hendrix !

To be honest, I'm not the best at guessing what 'twist' is coming and when I finally figured it out, I thought: \\"well, duh.\\" And then a minute later I found out I was wrong.  I kind of thought this would be a mad killer on a deserted ocean liner with a bunch of stranded people movie.  Okay, the killer picks off the unlucky people who come aboard one by one and in the end one or two of them survive.   Wrong!  Then after the killer is revealed, I kept thinking of ways to stop the killings that seemed to be pretty obvious.  Wrong again!  This movie delivered above and beyond what I expected.  The cast really did a nice job. At times I thought they were so unrealistic in their reactions to situations, but the unrealistic reactions just fit situation as it was really transpiring that you had to appreciate their work.  I really enjoyed this movie and the ending.  My advice is, if you watch it, watch the whole thing.  Don't turn it off early.  The ending is worth the wait and will give you something to think about.
B002JVWQSW|5.0|Cannot WAIT to buy this on DVD! Even friends who don't watch tv end up loving this show. It's hilarious!
B000Y7U98C|4.0|The cast does an incredible job in this movie. Chris Evans especially is really good, and I was very happy to see Hiroyuki Sanada in this. Only thing that bugs me a little is the third act. *spoiler* They set up how Pinbacker could've survived, but the way he's filmed and the things he endures (100% full sunlight on one part) make him almost supernatural. *end spoiler* They didn't need that. It was compelling enough without it, and it seems contrary to the realistic atmosphere they were going for, but as a whole, I still love the film. The story is intense and the pacing is tight. Having eight astronauts strapped to the back of a bomb is the perfect scenario for tension especially when you factor in human error. I wish Boyle would've done Alien Resurrection.<br /><br />The DVD is loaded with special features. The commentaries alone are worth listening to (the physicist one is incredibly interesting), but you also get very detailed production diaries. So despite the bad cover art (check out the Hong Kong release for what it should have been), this is definitely one you should own.

0199535981|5.0|This novel is one of the best classics available. It is more entertaining for its controversy value than for anything else. Lord Henry Wotton is probably the most engaging character in the entire novel, and one gets the impression he is the mouthpiece of Oscar Wilde himself. For the rest of this review, it will probably be enough to suggest you read it if you haven't, and include some quotes from Lord Henry:<br /><br />There is only one thing in the world worse than being talked about, and that is not being talked about.<br /><br />A man cannot be too careful in the choice of his enemies.<br /><br />Those who are faithful know only the trivial side of love; it is the faithless who know love's tragedies.<br /><br />The only way to get rid of a temptation is to yield to it.

B002I6251G|4.0|Their first two albums were two of my favorite recent pieces of music that I have bought in the last five years. You hear them compared to Joy Division or Depeche Mode a lot, and while their are some similarities they are definitely not a clone band.    Their third album does not disappoint. Yes, it is a bit different and I will admit I was a bit skeptical when I heard it was primarily and synth album. However, I am on my 3rd or 4th listen and it is growing on me.    I can't help but wonder why this band is not more popular in the states. They definitely fit that \\"new new wave brit pop\\" thing that's going around and IMO are a better band than many other UK acts out there now. I saw them in concert a few years ago and virtually no one in the audience seemed very familiar except myself!    Many of the reviews on here are negative because this album is so different than their other two. But, isn't that what you want from a band? To constantly be reinventing themselves?    I say job well done. 4 out of 5.
1591841151|3.0|This book is definitely not for \\"anyone starting anything\\", it is specifically for a techie looking to establish a start-up. There is some good advise on how to approach venture capitalists etc. but there are many chapters full of cliches and generic advise. Overall an average book...
B002XMGGK6|3.0|For the most part, this movie was unrealistic.  For example, how can this man manage to know exactly where someone will be buried to set up his toy robot and camera and how can he manage to tunnel from a warehouse into every cell in the solitary confinement department of a prison without anyone noticing or hearing anything!!! So yes, most of the events are fake but the movie overall was really good.  It presented a good argument regarding what is considered right and wrong in the justice system and whether the justice system is stable or an imperfect tool.  The acting was impeccable on both Jamie Foxx's and Gerard Butler's part and the action was continuous.  Also important, the ending was not cheesy although it too was largely unrealistic.  In conclusion I would buy the movie due to the wonderful acting, continous thrilling action, and the overall meaning of the movie which itself can be very REAL for anyone put in the same position that Gerard Butler's character was placed it.
B000002U82|5.0|I love pieces of the Wall tremoundously but in its entirety I would select Dark Side of the Moon as the better album with very little thought.  I see the 1 and 2 star reviews and it boggles my mind.  These have to be people who love to argue just for the sake of argueing.  I can understand that the album would not be a 4 or 5 for everyone but the number of 1 and 2 star reviews makes no sense. What are these people listening to? What do they consider a 4 or 5 star album?

I will give you that Metallica made some terrific albums but I would put them after this.  If I could only have a few albums to listen to for the rest of my life this is the first one I would choose.

B00000K3G8|5.0|and go buy this video! Isn't that what you wanted to know? Well there you go. Ok, I'll elaborate a little...<br /><br />Not long ago, I wasn't a Talking Heads fan. I certainly wasn't in the 80s when I was in high school and college. Then I picked up their single-disc greatest hits and started listening, figuring I would at least like a few of the songs. After reading many reviews and being somewhat confused about the best \\"next step,\\" I decided the next step was to buy \\"Stop Making Sense.\\" I had heard it's one of the best concert films of all time and it certainly had good ratings here to back that up. It ain't exactly cheap as DVDs go, but could that many people be wrong? It just sounded like a lot of fun and I figured that even if I only watched it once or twice it was much cheaper than a concert ticket runs these days. So I took the plunge.<br /><br />In a nutshell, it lives up to its billing. There is no one single reason why it's such a good video. It's not gimmicky and it's not high-tech; there are no Avatar-like special effects or pyrotechnics. It's just a very good concert film done the way they should be. It features a band at its creative peak with lots of good material to draw on, and adds an exceptional group of \\"extras\\" (musicians and singers), all of whom are clearly having a lot of fun. One of its primary draws is that it is so engaging. A professional film-maker (Demme) directed the film and the quality shows. You may have read where the film exudes energy and it certainly does that too. The extended band and back-up singers are very good and really help flesh out the sound. David Byrne is particular fun to watch. At one point he starts running laps around the stage, as if he had extra energy to use up. It's also fun to see him dancing in the big suit.<br /><br />There are other things to like as well. The music was remastered for the 1999 re-release and sounds very good. You'll get 18-song concert and not a clunker in the bunch; it's basically a live version of TH's greatest hits up to 1984. On top of this, some of the songs are so strong when sung live that it's kind of hard to go back and listen to the studio versions. In fact, watching SMS even made me like a few of the songs on the Greatest Hits that I wasn't too keen on before. The music is also clean; you can watch it with kids (who are likely to appreciate the energy). My 10-year old son and I have a good time trying to replicate some of the Byrne's unusual dance moves. Best of all, after watching the video a few times, I still want to watch it. I could go watch it again right now in fact. It's not like a drama that gets old after you know how it turns out; it's more like one of those good comedies that gets better each time you watch it.<br /><br />So, if you're a TH fan, you probably have this already but if you don't, you should definitely get it. If you're a casual TH fan who likes the songs you have heard on the radio, I would advise you to go for it--there's more good stuff where that came from. And if you are just someone who enjoys good concert films, I would also recommend buying it. After you do, just put on your loosest-fitting clothing and watch it with someone fun when you're in a good mood...or wanting to get in one.test hits up to 1984.

0393072231|3.0|This book purports to be an expose of a variety of Wall St firms, who demonstrated either incredible stupidity or greed, or both, in many of their financial transactions in the 1990s and 2000s, involving mortgage-based bonds, which were clearly unsustainable and, worse, egregiously harmed millions of unsuspecting investors with profound impacts rippling into the entire economy. There is at least a small amount of guilt that creeps into these pages, as the author is cognizant of the outrageous sums he was paid working for Solomon Brothers as a trader in the 1980s despite his profound lack of expertise - but things could and did get more absurd. It has to be said that the book is a disappointment. There is no attempt to understand Wall St shenanigans in a broader social or economic perspective. Where are the laissez-faire vs. regulation arguments? For that matter, where is the outrage? What do these last two decades say about American culture and character? Are we all just a bunch of con-men?<br /><br />The author's approach in this story is to profile a few strange, anti-social investor types working on Wall St who saw that packaging loans made to credit unworthy persons into bonds for sale to investors was a disaster waiting to happen, probably bordering on criminal fraud. These individuals did not run screaming to regulators. No, they played the system, making enormous sums of money, by buying pseudo insurance securities called credit default swaps that paid off when the bonds defaulted, as they most assuredly did. Another similar hedge was CDOs, or collateralized debt obligations, apparently created by Goldman Sachs, who then persuaded insurance giant AIG to assume the risk in paying them off with no funds set aside to do so. And that is the situation that American taxpayers had to prop up. The author is not at his best in clearly explaining the workings of these and other financial instruments, including the use of terminology such as buying long or short. The argument that Wall St firms simply did not understand the instability they created in the search for enormous profits is belied by the calculated efforts undertaken to disguise and hide the vulnerabilities.<br /><br />The book is partly unsatisfactory because the author cannot make up his mind as to whether he wants to celebrate those who scammed the scam or to mildly rebuke the larger financial system, at least its most egregious aspects. He keeps the book moving by focusing on his collection of quirky, nerdy persons, but at the cost of remaining superficial. The book is mostly unsatisfactory because the author does not tackle the larger picture of the ascendance of Wall St and the financializatoin of our economy - the enormous profits, income, and inequality that result from shuffling paper, while our manufacturing sector is gutted with untold devastation to communities and families. Ideas concerning shared prosperity among all classes of Americans that had wide acceptance in the generation after WWII now seem quaint. Some may find the book entertaining. Others may wonder about accountability and justice. In such a world, there would be thousands in jail with tens of billions recouped for the harm that they have inflicted on American society. That's the book many would like to see written.hat Wall St firms simply did not understand the instability they created in the search for enormous profits is belied by the calculated efforts undertaken to disguise and hide the vulnerabilities.

1423113497|5.0|I recently read the Lightning Thief followed by the entire Percy Jackson series and they have already made it to my shelf of favorite books. Although the targeted audience for this book is mainly young readers but this is a story that appeals to people of all ages. The Lightning Thief is immensely entertaining and very funny! Rick Riordan introduces Greek mythology to a completely new audience of readers with his clever and exciting story. The Lightning Thief has a very similar feel to the Harry Potter series but with very different characters and plot. If you enjoyed the Harry Potter series then you will definitely enjoy the Lightning Thief. All of the characters in the story are very lovable and I guarantee you will become very attached to them! I loved the idea of the main heroes having ADHD and dyslexia, but instead of being a disadvantage, as they usually would be viewed they become strengths for the young demigods. This book is filled with action, adventure, and humor. Once I started I literally could not put it down and as soon as I finished it I went out and bought the other four. I would highly recommend the Lightning Thief and the entire Percy Jackson series!
1416500286|5.0|\\"Emma Woodhouse, handsome, clever, and rich, with a comfortable home and happy disposition\\" is a suitable heroine for Jane Austen's lightest, frothiest novel. While \\"Emma\\" is not nearly as dramatic as Austen's other works, it is an enchanting little comedy of manners in which a young woman with the best intentions meddles in others' love lives... with only the faintest idea of how people (including herself) actually feel.<br /><br />After matchmaking her governess Miss Taylor, Emma Woodhouse considers herself a natural at bringing people together. She soon becomes best buddies with Harriet, a sweet (if not very bright) young woman who is the \\"natural daughter of somebody.\\" Emma becomes determined to pair Harriet with someone deserving of her (even derailing a gentleman-farmer's proposal), such as the smarmy, charming Mr. Elton. When Emma's latest attempt falls apart, she finds that getting someone OUT of love is a lot harder than getting them INTO it.<br /><br />At around the same time, two people that Emma has heard about her entire life have arrived -- the charming Frank Churchill, and the reserved, remote Miss Jane Fairfax (along with rumors of a married man's interest in her). Emma begins a flirtatious friendship with Frank, but for some reason is unable to get close to Miss Fairfax. As she navigates the secrets and rumors of other people's romantic lives, she begins to realize who she has been in love with all along.<br /><br />Out of all Jane Austen's books, \\"Emma\\" is the frothiest and lightest -- there aren't any major scandals, lives ruined, reputations destroyed, financial crises or sinister schemes. There's just a little intertwined circle of people living in a country village, and how one young woman tries to rearrange them in the manner that she genuinely thinks is best. Of course, in true comedy style everything goes completely wrong.<br /><br />And despite the formal stuffiness of the time, Austen wrote the book in a languidly sunny style, threading it with a complex web of cleverly orchestrated rumors and romantic tangles. There's some moments of seriousness (such as Emma's rudeness to kind, silly Miss Bates), but it's also laced with some entertaining dialogue (\\"Silly things do cease to be silly if they are done by sensible people in an impudent way\\") and barbed humor (the ridiculous and obnoxious Mrs. Elton).<br /><br />Modern readers tend to be unfairly squicked by the idea of Emma falling for a guy who's known her literally all her life, but Austen makes the subtle relationship between Knightley and Emma one of affectionate bickering and beautiful romantic moments (\\"If I loved you less, I might be able to talk about it more. But you know what I am. You hear nothing but truth from me\\").<br /><br />Emma is a character who is likable despite her flaws -- she's young, bright, well-meaning and assured of her own knowledge of the human heart, but also naive and sometimes snobbish. She flits around like a clumsy butterfly, but is endearing even when she screws up. Mr. Knightley is her ideal counterpoint, being enjoyably blunt and sharp-witted at all times. And there's a fairly colorful supporting cast -- Emma's neurotic but sweet dad, her kindly ex-governess, the charming Frank, the fluttery Miss Bates, and even the smarmy Mr. Elton and his bulldozing wife.<br /><br />\\"Emma\\" is the most lightweight and openly comedic of all Jane Austen's novels, with a likable (if clueless) heroine and a multilayered plot full of half-hidden feelings.

0061474355|5.0|Sabriel is one of the most unique and compelling young adult novels I have ever read. Young adult fantasy series often contain worlds that are too similar to those of Tolkien or Tamora Pierce, but the world Garth Nix created is unlike any other and intrigued me from start to finish. The book's plot revolves around the young female protagonist, Sabriel, in her quest to find her father who has recently disappeared. Sabriel and her father are necromancers but unlike most necromancers they lay the dead to rest rather than raise the dead for evil purposes. Sabriel must step into her place as the new Abhorsen (the official title of the good necromancer for the Old Kingdom) in order to save both her father. As her journey progresses two more characters join her in her quest, Touchstone a young man with a mysterious past and Mogget, a cat creature of unknown origins who has served the Abhorsen for years. Together the trio attempts to rescue Sabriel's father from a dark creature and save the entire kingdom.<br /><br />The characters in Sabriel are one of the greatest parts of the Abhorsen trilogy. In young adult fiction today it has become a trend for female characters to be weak and obsessively infatuated in their romances with other male characters. Sabriel is probably the strongest female character I have read about in a young adult series in years, ranking up there with Eowyn of the Lord of the Rings and Alanna of the Lioness Quartet. She is strong and confident but not unrealistically so. Her character is so refreshing from the \\"Bella Swan\\" characters that seem to be taking over books in the young adult genre.  The book includes a small romance that I enjoyed reading because I love both of the characters involved very dearly and despite this aspect being included it does not dominate the entire plot.<br /><br />The story of Sabriel will get you hooked within the first few pages. It includes everything from action and adventure to moments that are dark and downright chilling.  This book had me laughing (the dry, sarcastic humor of Mogget will have you laughing throughout the whole book), crying, and begging for more! I highly recommend this book; I promise you will not be disappointed!k had me laughing (the dry, sarcastic humor of Mogget will have you laughing throughout the whole book), crying, and begging for more!

B000YIGNKE|1.0|I love this book and love everything Jane Austen.  I am a huge fan of the 1995 version and I had really high hopes for this BBC masterpiece theatre version.  But sadly, I was very disappointed.  The characters were unbelievable and the screenplay was horrid.  The casting of this production was poorly done.  None of the sailors looked like weathered sailors that went through a war! The acting was sub-par and the plot seems all over the place.  Captain Wentworth was good key candy but that is not enough to save this movie.  I basically cringed through the entire 2 hours or so and I actually covered my eyes at the ending.  The most painful scene for me wasn't the running but the actual kiss at the end...It was so incredibly painful to watch!! Sigh...I really really wanted to like this film.
B002VPE1B6|5.0|This movie is the greatest film in my opinion, the special effects and the 3d are just adding to the great enviromental message james cameron tied in with it. This version may not have all the special features that some customers may like but once again in my opinion the extra stuff is not needed as cameron said the disc does not include \\"the crap\\". I mean really do you by movies for the features and all the trailers that come with it, no you buy it for the movie itself not all the crap that comes with it. Cameron also said that are making this single disc the best special effects into this disc to utlize all the space on it. I have seen this movie seven times and will buy all the editions that will hopefully follow the greatest movie all time and the highest grossing film of all time.One more thing is why the heck are all these crackheads complaing about how it is barebones and that you should buy the later edition thats comin out this november, that means if you listen to those jarheads youll have the special features and all that crap of dumb trailers but you wont have the entire movie itself which is the entire reason why in my own opinion you go out and buy movies!
B00006CXSS|5.0|While certainly santized for television, World War through Band of Brothers is great.  The sepia tones and filming are awesome and the editing, acting, scenes and language go a long way toward capturing the overall feeling that make this series work.  I highly recommend this box set.  The actual veterans talking between the discs is pure bonus material.
B0014Z4OQG|2.0|the way the movie was shot was entertaining. I actually enjoyed looking at the movie. Other than that, the story plot was a total waste of my time and the only character I honestly cared about was the one holding the video camera....I was actually glad when everybody else died, it was that painful to watch.    The most painful part of the movie to watch was the very beginning, at the party scene. That poor attempt for character development and cliche drama was just a tad bit much. I think that scene was a full 20 minutes, or was it 30? Who knows, it was too long.

The aquaintance who loaned it to us told us that we \\"would cry\\". Well yes, we cried for the wasted 2 hours that we spent on this drivel.<br /><br />Fist of all the movie started with a totally confusing scene. Who was the man who wanted to enroll this young man in the school?.Why did they take him with his academic record, where was he from? Are we to really believe they wanted him because of his sports record...and if so, doesn't this kind of jar with the sentimantal feel good feeling that this movie is said to convey? To hell with the rest of them, this one will be good for our team!<br /><br />We found the guy pushing the swings in the playground very creepy, yet no parents are concerned. Hmmmmmm?<br /><br />Then it really gots worse....this family who aparently never noticed any poor kids before, decide to take this kid in. Though they live in a house the size of 4 city blocks, they have to put this guy up...on the couch! Of course the kid is wider than a king size bed, but that's where he sleeps...come on.<br /><br />Lest I go on too much, I will end with the ridiculous football scene where, despite being suited up....probably special uniform ordered for his size, the kid knows nothing about football and actually picks a player up and carries him over his shoulder. Really? The scene is played as a big laugh and it seems everyone enjoys laughing AT this poor kid. Mean spirited to say the least.<br /><br />Ok, everyone loved this movie, but it is NOT a nice feel good movie. As for attention at the Oscars, give me a break.
0393072231|4.0|Bought it in hard copy, scanned it, and imported it using an app for my Kindle.       Enjoyable and insightful.  I give 4 stars not 5 becuase of Lewis's change of position on derivatives.
0375413405|5.0|The recipes in this book are easy to follow- sometimes you have to go back and forth when referred to a different page number for a recipe or cooking tip but worth it as what a great learning experience in food and cooking tips.  I love recipes that go back to the original- good ingredients make an incredible dish that is enjoyable to eat.
031606792X|2.0|Look!  It'a a vampire, no, a werewolf!  Nope!  It's super Bella!  Able to leap tall Vampires with a single whine! She can bend weak minded werewoves with her helpless act!    Boy, if ever a book felt like a reading assignment!  I guess you have to be a hopeless, and I mean hopeless romantic, or a real softee to really like this book enough to read it more than once.  Think about it, Bella gets everything, I mean everything she wanted, without loosing a thing!  Don't get me wrong, I like when a woman, or in this case, a girl wins.  But, I like them to be kind of on the strong side.  At one point, I really wanted one of her beaus to come to their senses and walk away, bit her, or something!  I can only say that on a scale of one to ten, it's a four.  I will keep this book with the others.  I just hope my youngest granddaughter will forgive me when I give her my collection when she is old enough to read them. Well, I could always leave out the last one....
B0036XN2L2|5.0|This album is incredible. It's got everything: heavy songs, fast energetic songs, and slow melodic numbers.<br /><br />I absolutely loved most of the songs on this album. \\"The Good Die Young\\" and especially \\"Lorelei\\" prove once again that The Scorpions are an absolute Heavyweight Champion when it comes to rock ballads. The weakest track (IMO) is \\"Slave Me\\". It's not that it's bad, it's just that I don't really like the flow of it (musically and lyrically). But other than that the whole thing is incredible.<br /><br />I highly recommend this album. If the band truly ends up retiring after this effort, they will most certainly go out on top.
B000MLNUBI|5.0|I love the look of skeleton watches, and I've looked at every single kind, and this one is probably the best one for the price. A lot of other skeleton watches here on Amazon are designer watches that are made in China, not the excellent Swiss craftsmanship that you get with this watch.<br /><br />This is a mechanical watch, which means it is nowhere near as accurate as a quartz watch. Mine gains a few minutes every month, but that's OK... you're not buying this watch for the accuracy, you're buying it for the nostalgia and aesthetics, and it is a beautiful watch indeed.<br /><br />One con: the stainless steel bracelet is very prone to scuff marks, I got scratch marks on mine just after a few days of use, but I heard that you can take it to any jeweler to have it polished.
0061766089|4.0|I have no experience in product design or graphics, or advertising etc. But after reading this book I am trying to think creatively in solving the everyday business problems. I think this is a great book written with lot of interesting case studies and written in a very smooth and flowing style. It won;t be right if I start typing here key learnings from this book, since every person will have a different learning depending on his/her field of experience.<br /><br />AS a designer you have not work with the existing constraints and still bring something new to life. That is quiet a big challenge. There can be several ways to breaking the mold and casting something which no one has ever seen before. This is what this book is all about.

B000I186FW|5.0|Our emotions are more true than our reason.   Even a justified wrong has a price.  For the despot the price  is the end of a wrong. For the victim the price is personal.  The books always balance.  This is a wonderful story about truth, exploring the justification of means, the nature of good and evil, and even the hope for the future.  The story satisfies our need to see fairness in the resolution of conflicts.  Though not all of these conflicts can be made my own, and some of the resolutions did not ring true,it is a soul pleaser at its core.

B002A9OJ0Q|4.0|I've been a fan since Hunting High and Low.  To my mind they are the most underrated band in the past 30 or so years.  At least in the USA.  Alphaville being a close second.  This final release is one of my favorites.  Perhaps I have missed the lack of lyrical content because it just sounds so good.  I personally would trade a strong melody and suspect lyrics for deep lyrics where the music leaves you wanting.  They suffered from this midway through their career.  The music on this release is uplifting and the vocals are superb.  The fact that Morten can still sing like this pushing 50 is remarkable. As others have mentioned it has a much more electronic feel than most of their previous work.  And yes in some ways brings back the nostalgia of the first couple of releases.  However, in my opinion it feels fresh and stands on it's own merit.  Almost great from start to finish.  The exception would be the final track which I left off the MP3 player.  It is a throw away.

0345457692|3.0|This may be the most uniquely imagined future I have read in some time.  Mankind has colonized the stars and done it without ever conquering the speed of light.  They have, however, discovered a method of transmitting data faster than light.  So while it is too cumbersome to travel in one's body across the stars, it is a much simpler (though still pricey) to braodcast your consciousness to another planet and 'sleeve' it into another body.  Oh, and there actually were Martians once upon a time.  Explorers discovered ancient ruins of an abandoned, hypertechnological civilization that once occupied this region of the galaxy. And they had wings.  Who knew?    And we arrive in this future with Takeshi Kovacs, a retired (fired?) special operations soldier who had been downloaded into the sleeve (body) of a cop in San Francisco.  A 300 year old billionaire has been murdered and resurrected.  He has brought Kovacs to Earth to solve his murder.      And from there, it gets messy and unnecessarily complicated and contrived.  Amazingly, despite all the multiple characters and villains and red herrings and bimbos, I didn't care that I wasn't following all of the action by the end.  Kovacs and his noir sci-fi world are a great ride, and the good news is that the sequel is much better plotted.

1591843162|5.0|When Seth Godin speaks, he almost always says something worth listening to, and this book is no exception. Very few people live their lives in a fully engaged manner, doing what they do with passion and taking responsibility for the results; but those who do choose to stop settling for what is \\"good enough\\" and start creating art that matters end up making contributions to the world many times more valuable than those who do not.<br /><br />The workplace is filled with notetakers, bureaucrats, literalists, manual readers, map followers and fearful employees; people who do what they are told to do, rather than exercising initiative; people who let someone else take the blame, rather than taking ownership of the problem and seeking a solution. Instead, Seth says, we need original thinkers, provocateurs and people who care; we need linchpins, indispensible human beings who can bring things together and make a difference.<br /><br />Anyone can choose to become a linchpin. You do not have to be born with a particular talent; it is something that you choose to train yourself to do. If you hold a leadership position within an organisation, this book will challenge you about how you can encourage your people to become linchpins. If you do not hold a leadership position, the book will encourage you to think about how you can make a bigger difference wherever you are.

1439190275|5.0|I am not one for diets, I'm more of an everything in moderation person. But several of my family members have turned their lives around with Atkins and were thrilled about this new edition. After years of hearing my mom rave about how great she felt - rather obnoxiously I might add - I decided to pick up the book just to get some insight into the seemingly complex world of \\"net carbs\\" and \\"induction phases.\\"     I have to say - the book makes sense. Moderation will only get you so far, and frankly, it's a cop out. Choosing the right, nutrient-dense foods make you feel fuller and give you the strength you need not to fall asleep at your desk during the day. Also, for the most part (because I love me some carbs), my body is burning off the carbs, not the fat.     My biggest issue with the \\"plan\\" diets was always the restriction. I figured that they couldn't possibly be sustainable if they were restrictive. Also, it annoyed me that my mom never felt that she could eat when we wanted to go out for dinner. The new book, however, has an awesome guide for all types of restaurants and it's very practical so that the diet seems less like a diet and more like a lifestyle. Mainly, it's really easy to adapt the New Atkins to fit your life - even good advice for vegetarians and vegans. Lots of fun recipes too.    I've started following their advice and I actually feel really good about this. I admit it... I'm converted.
1843106698|5.0|I was recently asked to recommend a book on Asperger's Syndrome and, without hesitation, this was the one. It covers everything you need to know about Asperger's in clear, easy-to-read, jargon-free language.<br /><br />The most likely readership is probably parents who have discovered their child has Asperger's and want to know what the future holds for their child. A large part of the book caters for this scenario and Dr Attwood provides many techniques for parents that can help their child and aid his or her integration into mainstream schools and beyond. However, Dr Attwood never strays far from the incredible gifts that Asperger's can also bring  - something that may be hard to see when a diagnosis is first made. The Complete Guide to Asperger's Syndrome also covers adolescents, with some very plain and useful advice for emerging into adulthood and all the pitfalls that can arise.<br /><br />What made the book particularly relevant to me is that I was diagnosed as an adult and I read this book with my wife so that I could finally explain how and why I see the world differently to her. There is nothing so liberating as having all your eccentricities explained and described. Even here, however, the book stresses the gifts that Asperger's brings and, whilst I am undoubtedly different as a result of the condition, I would certainly not want to be any other way. Dr Attwood understands this and his advice is relevant, compassionate, and very real.<br /><br />I must cut this short as Asperger's people have a habit of rambling. If you are reading this because of a diagnosis of Asperger's, fear of a diagnosis, or even wanting to get to know your odd friends better, this is the book you should read. It takes away the fear and makes you feel very privileged to be in the presence of such an intriguing condition.

0307277453|5.0|Shubin has written a highly informative, well organized, and superbly presented explanation of transitional species, where they have been found, and the impact they have had on the studies of paleontology, microbiology, human anatomy, and many other sciences.  And he does it in a manner that even Social Science Ph.D.s can comprehend.  The fact that he hasn't attacked creationists directly significantly contributes to the readability of this book.  Straight forward with the facts.  Much better than other books that continuously offer aggravating snide or sarcastic remarks and attacks on the Intelligent Design and Creationist opponents of evolution.<br /><br />I'll recommend this to my children, my grand children, and every Bible Thumper that knocks on my door.  I'll be adding it to a recommended reading list I present to all my first year undergraduate students.  Shubin gives the reader the simple (and sometimes not so simple) truth - and that truth will set your mind free.

0307463745|2.0|Granted, \\"Rework\\" may provide some value for a recent grad starting a business, or a mom-and-pop venture that has never been in the business world.    I'm a user of 37signal's products, and I applaud the useability of those products and can easily relate the spirit of the book to those products. However, very little of what is presented in the book is revealing or insightful. I see \\"Rework\\" exemplified every day in both successful business and failed businesses. Sure, there are a lot of businesses that *don't* adhere to this tone but they, too, are both successful and unsuccessful.    All-in-all, I found it a disappointing read. However, I *would* recommend it to my early-20's son if he ever decided to start a business.
0920668372|1.0|I received this book as a gift at my baby shower earlier this year.  I cracked it open for the first time to read to my 6 mo. old son tonight and I am very grateful that he is still to young to understand what was going on.  This book is profoundly disturbing, featuring a disgustingly codependent mother who engages in some extremely creepy behavior.  The only thing I find more perplexing and disquieting than this book is the apparent love that so many people have for it.  If anything, this book has shown me how NOT to behave as a parent. I can certainly love my child forever without climbing in through his bedroom window when he's an adult!     I love books and have never thrown one away.  If I don't like one, I donate it or give it to someone who might enjoy it.      This is the first book I've ever put straight into the trash.
0321544080|5.0|I am a naturally curious person (technically), so this book is fun for me to read. It reveals how all pictures in the book were taken. Sometimes, it is not so obvious...It also helps understand why some types of pictures just look better than others.    Even though this book applies primarily to pro's with elaborate equipment (e.g., soft boxes, numerous light sources/strobes, grids, assistants, etc) there are many applicable hints for all photographers but perhaps starting from advanced amatures (such as myself).     It really makes you appreciate the art & science of photography and this highly skill author - he is artistic as well as technically competent.    I certainly recommend this book
B0007G89G4|5.0|I just don't get it. When you watch this movie you just can't get over what a good actor Corey Feldman is in this. The kid should have been nominated that year for best supporting actor he was so damn good in this movie. You would have thought that this kid would have gone on to be one of the finest adult actors in Hollywood. He didn't. I guess too much partying does ruin your brain or something because this kid had amazing potential. Go figure.   All the kids here are amazing. Their acting is better then most adult actors i've seen. When I say this is a great kid's movie I'm not being condescending. It's great because it doesn't talk down to kids and treat them like morons.   This is classic Americana by a classic American author.   I think we should all try to stand by poor Corey Feldman more. Maybe if Hollywood had more insight at the time and had nominated him for an award and recognized him seriously, he might be doing better right now.    Has anyone noticed how positive the feedback is on this film? It's quite a phenomenon.                            James                    (don't have the credit card but i buy the movies)
B0025KVLTW|5.0|It always provokes a little bit of humor and a little bit of chagrin when various parties publish \\"Top 500 Albums of All Time\\" or whatever, lists, and include one or two of the Beatles' albums but not the rest.  Why don't they be honest and include them all?    The Beatles had an unprecedented opportunity to produce greatness, and an unprecedented sense of responsibility towards it.  Although their first few albums may sound a little unsophisticated (and don't forget they 'invented' sophistication, along with a few others), the rest are just inpeccable    Nothing really exceeds Magical Mystery Tour.  Made just before the universally-beloved-by-critics Sergeant Pepper, it contains some of their most effort-filled and most inspired songs.  \\"Penny Lane\\", \\"Strawberry Fields\\", the opening theme, \\"I Am the Walrus\\" and several others are a part of not just Western culture but of world culture as well.

B001GZ6QEC|2.0|Unpleasant, dark (as in, poor lighting!), and needlessly violent, this is not at all the definitive Batman film that many fanboys would like to make it out to be, and in fact is one of the worst screen versions of the Batman since George Clooney donned the cowl.<br /><br />Bale, as Batman, is a failure. As Bruce Wayne he hardly seems authoritative, or, indeed, very interesting. His \\"Batman voice\\" just sounds as if he just had some sort of throat operation. Bale has always been a stiff, inexpressive actor, and he is never more so than here. His Batman is so unhuman that it makes you wonder why Gordon trusts him at all; the viewer certainly doesn't. This Batman's outbursts of hyperviolent, uncontrollable rage - a trait completely counter to the original comic book version of Batman - are the final touch in making this Batman, and Bale, very dislikable.<br /><br />The flatness that Bale brings to the screen makes Heath Ledger's Joker that much more of a contrast. Ledger's Joker is not an Oscar-worthy performance. To be blunt, he's chewing the scenery at a level that would have been hilarious if it were not for the fact that he died shortly after making the movie. Ledger's performance is not one for the ages, as too many claim. It is easy - far too easy - to play a psychotic, over-the-top villain. It takes little acting skill. The hype that has surrounded Ledger's performance here has to do with his death, not his skillfulness in the role.<br /><br />In all truth, his performance is no better or worse than Jack Nicholson's in the Tim Burton Batman. Yes, Ledger brings a collection of tics, glares, twitches, and cackles to the part that are somewhat entertaining - but that can't be counted as acting. The hype that Ledger explored his \\"dark side\\" for this role is just so much urban legend tripe. He's overacting, in a movie that was written for him to overact in. The Joker gets all the obvious water-cooler-quote/internet-worthy lines. The combination of Ledger's overacting and the obviousness of the script becomes tiresome.<br /><br />Maggie Gyllenhaal seems lost in this mess. She seems the only real human in a movie full of phony, hyperextended male egos. The less said about Aaron Eckhart's completely predictable Harvey Dent/Two-Face, the better. He provides a third, completely unnecessary, hyper-egotistical psycho for the script, and as such serves as a fifth or even a sixth wheel, slowing the script and providing unnecessary complications and false drama.<br /><br />The action scenes are, as usual these days, too loud, too long, too violent, and too hard to see. Everything is always too dark.<br /><br />To sum up, this is an unpleasant movie that panders to its fanboy audience and makes up for its severe shortcomings through bluster, volume, and just plain ugliness. It's unworthy of the Batman legacy. And it is unworthy to be counted among the best superhero movies. In spite of all the hype, The Dark Knight does not hold a candle to the Marvel superhero movies - Spiderman and Iron Man outdo it in almost every way. In spite of the fact that few people will agree with me, I would not be able to recommend this movie to anyone. Overhyped, underacted, and badly written, it's a mess.the script becomes tiresome.

B0030IIYWA|5.0|Ok, the movie is great and better on BluRay, so the 5 stars...    The BAD part is that if you order from Amazon, you get the old-fashioned DVD case NOT the standard BluRay case that you would expect. You can get them from Disney, but it costs $3.95 for each BluRay case. Normally, I buy from Amazon, but I would suggest that if you want the normal BluRay case, then you need to buy this elsewhere or be prepared to spend $8 more to get those BluRay cases from Disney.

1400031524|2.0|OK, I'm not going to give away the ending.  But here is the plot.  Two men are found dead in a liferaft, apparently with expensive clothes put on them after death.  This is a mystery that isn't solved.  A Latvian cop is killed and for some reason, the Latvian police call on Kurt Wallender -- who is Swedish and speaks not a word of Latvian -- to cross the Baltic and solve their crime.  Good investigative technique -- interview people who don't speak your language.  But that's the premise of this book, and it makes no sense at all!  Okay, so it is dark and brooding and Scandinavian, but give me a break.  At least give us some kind of plot to make us suspend disbelief (This may be easier in Sweden where everyone drinks, smokes, drinks coffee and commits suicide.)  It is well written but you've got to have a plot.  Oh yes, in the end the solution comes from out of nowhere after Wallender has messed it up.
0061547840|4.0|I have read 100's of very poor books on the Laws of Attraction in the last few years. I started reading books about goal setting, mind control and success principles in 1985. I have used what I learnt from my extensive reading, coupled with academic qualifications, business and psychology experience, to create a consulting company, teaching seminars to corporations in strategic thinking, leadership, marketing, goal setting and business development. I also use the principles to help individuals, by guiding them as a Peak Performance Coach, teaching people cognitive methods to help goal set and enhance their lives beyond what they could do on their own. As such, I read as many books as I can, on a variety of subjects to enhance my knowledge. I can honestly say, that with all that experience, that this book is a very good book to read on self development. It is written by a man who thinks BIG and shares this philosophy to everyone who reads it.    There are no amazing insights that you will not find, in other self development book. The self help ideas are interwoven into Trump's own stories of success and some failings. Some of the stories are repeated throughout the book. In fact a lot of the ideas are repeated and repeated. This is another book that could have done with some editing, although every time he repeats a story he does link it to the point he is making. I think the best way to describe this book is that it is motivating, whilst educating the reader how a Billionaire thinks. There are some very good insights on failure and mind set, which most self help readers will like. There is enough business philosophy and deal making ideas to satisfy the business reader.    What I did like, at the end of each chapter, there is a box that provides a summation of the chapter, and then a list of point by point references, to the key parts of the material in the chapter.    Whilst this book could have done with some editing, it is on the whole a great read for those interested in self help or business. It has some very good insights, and I will be reading more Trump books in the future. Whilst not as dense in detail as a John Maxwell self help book, this book offers a great insight into Trump as a; person, businessman and BIG THINKER. Great book, well worth reading.

It sits dusty and tattered in an honored place on my shelf behind my desk with my Isaac Asimov tomes as if one day I might pick it up and read it again - which at the moment is very unlikely due to the stack of yet unread books in front of it.<br /><br />I bought this book because at the time I was into motorcycles, cross-country trips, and I did my own vehicle maintenance.  It had some of that, but it was soon evident that this book had little to offer to anyone planning a cross-country trip on a motorcycle.  Yet there was a bigger story - about insanity and sanity.  I stayed with the book because I was also very much into exploring psychology and philosophy.<br /><br />I was very impressed with this book - not so much for the gratuitous philosophy, which I found boring, but for the story of an intelligent man who went insane, perhaps because he read too much of other's philosophies without developing his own, who subsequently underwent electroshock to \\"purge\\" his old identity and form a new one, but in time (culminating on the cross-country motorcycle trip narrated in the book) recovers his old identity, safely merged with his new identity, and more or less now safely \\"sane,\\" however we define sane. And the burning question raised as to whether such procedures as electric shock had merit as a medical tool.<br /><br />I believed the story was an actual account, and the author assures us that it is indeed based on facts.  As a factual account, it thereby has merit and a real lesson to be learned - which would probably be different for each reader.<br /><br />Some of the reviews here seem to focus on the philosophical content as what makes the story meritorious, and suggest the story might be nothing more than a fabricated account created to stealthily teach the reader philosophical concepts.  I disagree, non too disrespectfully.  Rather, I think, it was too much absorption of the philosophizing of others that led to the insanity and loss of identity, and it was not until he developed his own philosophy, perhaps synthesizing this and that from others, that he becomes sane again.<br /><br />I like philosophy, but only my own and the philosophizing attempts of the ancients as they initiated incipient science, philosophy and mathematics. However, I detest most modern philosophy, especially that associated with modern concepts of secular progressivism, as so much mental masturbation - perhaps it feels good, but it has little to nothing to do with furthering humanity, and perhaps a lot to do with corroding and confusing social values.<br /><br />This book has great merit, not for all the bits of philosophy interspersed, but for the realization the story might help us achieve that we must in the final analysis create our own internal philosophy that is workable and realistic - as president George W. Bush so colloquially said - to be \\"comfortable in our own skin.\\"at led to the insanity and loss of identity, and it was not until he developed his own philosophy, perhaps synthesizing this and that from others, that he becomes sane again.

0312370849|4.0|A popular type of novel is one that tells dual stories; one story takes place in the past, the other is set in the present, with both stories relating and enlarging upon the other.  This is the technique used with some success in Sarah's Key by Tatiana de Rosnay.      One part of the story is set during World War II and focuses on the life of ten year old Sarah, who along with her mother and father are rounded up by French police during the brutal Nazi-inspired raids that took place in Paris on July 16, 1942. Known as the Vel'd'Hiv, the roundup of tens of thousands of Jews who were eventually doomed to be exterminated  in the Auschwitz death camps along with thousands of their children, was  particularly infamous because it went well beyond even the stringent requirements of the Nazi's and was more the result of the zeal of their French collaborators.    Nearly 60 years later, Julia Jarmond an American journalist living in Paris with her French husband and young daughter stumbles across the story of Sarah while researching an article about the Vel'd'Hiv.  In fact, Julia discovers to her great amazement and consternation that the apartment her in-laws had lived in for decades had been the apartment from which young Sarah and her mother and father had been dragged  in the middle of the night.  As they were harried and threatened, amidst their cries and terror, Sarah managed to hid her young brother in a locked closet to which she kept the key, planning to return to him in a day or two.    But will she be able to escape her captors and return to free her little brother? Most of the tension and the powerful emotion of the book centers on Sarah and her desperation and despair. By comparison, Julia's life seems less compelling, despite her struggles with her husband and her inner turmoil as she tries with increasing urgency to learn the truth about Sarah while at the same time facing up to the truth in her own life.  Certainly there are few modern day problems that can becompared to the horrors of the Holocaust, but Sarah's Key is a novel of remembrance, first and foremost, honoring the victims of the Vel'd'Hiv, and urging the modern reader never to forget.
B0036XN2L2|5.0|Let me start that i`ve been a big fan of the Scorpions for over 20 years and like a lot of fans was sadden by the recent announcement of their impending retirement. So like any good faithful fan, i decided to buy myself a copy of Sting In The Tail and i have to say that it is an absolutely excellent album by the Scorps. It has the classic sound that we`ve grown to known and love from the Scorps, abeit with a modern touch. Klaus Meine`s voice still sounds great as it did back in the day and the guitar work by Rudolf Schenker and Matthias Jabs is as strong as it ever was going all back to Lovedrive. Plus the rhythm section of Pawel Maciwoda and James Kottak does a great job of holding it all together. The songs are a nice mix of good time hard rock like Raised On Rock and Sting In The Tail, some heavy stuff like Slave Me and a couple of fine ballads with Lorelai and SLY. SLY without question is one of the Scorps` best ballads along with Holiday and Still Loving You. Plus The Best Is Yet To Come is a great song to end the album. I have to say that i got a bit emotional listening to it with the more reflective nature of the song. I couldn`t help but think about all of the good times i`ve had listening to the Scorps over the years. In closing i highly recommend Sting In The Tail. It is an excellent album that long time Scorpions fans like myself can be very proud of. Thank you Klaus, Rudy, Matthias, Powel, James, Herman, Frances, Uli and Michael for all of the great music and the good times it has brought us all. Lastly i hope to see the Scorpions inshrined in the Rock and Roll Hall Of Fame soon. Not only have they brought us so much great music over the years, but they`ve been among the finest ambassadors in rock by bringing a lot of fun and great times around the world.

B000000H3W|4.0|Seputura's Arise is one of the greatest Thrash albums of all time. There really isn't any other way around it. And while compared to other releases from Sepultura it fails in comparrison but the fact still remains that within the genre of Thrash, Arise is one of the hands down undisputed greats.<br /><br />The title track opens the album aggresively letting the listener know just exactly what they are in for with this ride. It keeps up through out the rest of the album. 'Desperate Cry' being the crown jewel off the record. Slow and crawling, sort of like death creeping. The album isn't without it's weak moments but they are few and very far inbetween.<br /><br />As a whole Arise is exactly what I want in my Thrash, lightning fast guitar riffs, powerful drums, concise lyrics and an attitude to match.
B002VECM4A|5.0|Precious is a sucker punch of a film but with its silver lining very well defined.  Claireece Precious Jones lives a life that Dante could have included in his Inferno.  Perhaps label it the 12th circle of hell.  It's 1987 Harlem, Precious is 16, illiterate, pregnant for the second time from her father, (the first one having been born with Down Syndrome) and has the joy of living with her welfare dependant mother who just happens to be the walking embodiment of hatred and cruelty.  How a mother could be so vile to her own child is beyond anything that approaches comprehensibility.  All Precious has in her life, is an innate sense of worth and penchant for fantasy, both of which manage to sustain her in a world that has, seemingly and indifferently, turned its back on her.  Having been kicked out of her high school due to her pregnancy,  she registers in an alternative school and with the love and support of her teacher (a wonderful Paula  Patton) and a myriad assortment of other teenage misfits, Precious starts to slowly see the light at the end of the tunnel; however, shortly after giving birth to her second child and setting about establishing her independence from her poisonous mother, she is  yanked down once again, after the untimely death of her father reveals yet another layer of his selfishness and betrayal.   Throughout this life extinguishing ordeal, she has the support of a caring social worker (an unrecognizable and extremely effective Mariah Carey) who believes in Precious and helps her to help herself.  The aforementioned may lead one to believe that this is a depressing film but it really isn't.  You see, Precious has been victimized her whole life but she's no one's victim.  She's a fighter, a survivor and a dreamer and she will not allow anyone to take from her what she values most:  Her sense of self.  No doubt, it's a tough movie to watch but the rewards are more than generous.    Gabourey Sidibe and Mo'Nique turn in performances that are as heartfelt and honest as they are unflinching and, at times, stomach churning.   Frankly, I was hoping for an upset in the Best Actress category at the Oscars.  There was no doubt in my mind that Mo'Nique had this one wrapped up.  It took but one scene to lock it in and those who have seen the film know which scene I'm referring to.  She asks, almost imploringly, pathetically in her attempt to justify her vitriol, \\"Who was going to love me?\\"  For once, she's vulnerable but it's not enough.  It's never enough.  The sense of pity and repugnance that moment yields is one of only a handful that I remember experiencing in a lifetime of serious film watching.  It's truly extraordinary.  From a technical/production standpoint, I couldn't find fault.  Special mention goes to the cinematographer who captured a time and place in a way that it stays with you long after the film ends.

B000006NPY|4.0|The thought of the Smashing Pumpkins is a pretty funny one. I mean I truly adore them (no pun intended), and I have always loved them for whatever reason. It might be Corgans often brilliant lyrics, or the dark cloud that follows each and every release the have ever put out. But....I honest to God hate the majority of the bands work. Why? Often times Corgans lyrics, and the dark cloud that surrounds each and everyone of the bands releases. With the exception of Siamese Dream, I can't listen to a single one of the bands albums from start to finish without skipping numerious songs, and exlaiming, \\"I hate this song.\\" But I still find an often sad charm about them and hold them near and dear to my heart even though I truly can't stand Billy Corgan.<br /><br />Adore is one of those albums that is so fantastically good in places and so offensively bad in others that it's hard to be imparshall. Where Adore shines ('Ava Adore' 'Perfect' 'Appels + Oranjes' 'Shame') it really shines, and damn brightly. But where it faulters, it falls extremely hard. Which is basically the entire rest of the album. It is just so damn blah at times that it's hard to believe this is the same group that released Siamese Dream which to me personally is one of the strongest and greatest albums in all of rock n' roll history. It's unforgibeable almost.<br /><br />Obviously this isn't the worst album the Smashing Pumpkins have ever released, but it's also so far from being their best that it's just another album released upon a musically unconcious world that will and has more or less ignored it, and honestly that's exactly how music of this caliber should be treated. It's albums like Adore that are making me feel less and less bad about downloading vs. purchessing.
B000001GY9|3.0|I am a big Bernstein fan but just occasionally the accusations regarding his \\"indulgence\\" and lack of momentum are true. In the case of these recordings he falls into the worst of some bad habits which vitiated some of his later recordings. Just as his Mozart symphonies are interesting and affectionate, but not necessarily the ones you would want to live with, especially when compared with less intrusive interpreters such as Maag and Mackerras, these interpretations of Schumann's great works evince some appealing features but are not really definitive (if you ever can get a definitive performance of any great work).<br /><br />A previous reviewer has characterised these versions as \\"gloopy\\" and he has a point. The sound is tubby, the homogeneity of the Viennese strings works against the requisite bite and attack, and Bernstein seems almost lacklustre at times - an incredible observation, I know, for so energised a conductor. To me, the essential problem is that Bernstein seems to be playing Schumann as a fully-paid-up high Romantic, when in fact he belongs much more to the sound world of Mendelssohn rather than Brahms. This approach actually seems to validate the erroneous accusation that Schumann's orchestration skills were deficient; played this way, the textures are indeed too thick and ploggy.<br /><br />My acid test for these symphonies is the opening of the Rhenish. It don't mean a thing, if it ain't got that swing, and Bernstein totally drains the syncopations of life; for the right mood I returned to my early 90's bargain discs with Janowski and the Royal Liverpool Philharmonic. Unlikely competition, I know, but they are superior; so much more spring and life in their phrasing and articulation. (Listen to their recent Rachmaninov recordings with Petrenko to see how they have become really world class - see my review of \\"The Isle of the Dead\\" and \\"Symphonic Dances\\", or the Piano Concertos).<br /><br />So as much as I am a Lenny devotee, I am sad to say that this is not one of his successes. \\"A special affinity for (sic) Schumman (sic bis)\\" is just what he lacks here. Strange how he could have had such an affinity with Haydn (see my review of the 12 disc bargain box set from Sony) yet not with Schumann's idiom.ccesses. \\"A special affinity for (sic) Schumman (sic bis)\\" is just what he lacks here.

B001VZY4M8|4.0|Even though this album was released 40 years ago, I have just recently picked it up.  For many fans this is considered one of Neil Young's essential if not best albums.  Indeed \\"Goldrush\\" represents both the folksy country-ish Young as well as the more rocking hard edged Young that would 30 years later be dubbed \\"the godfather of grunge\\".  Tracks like \\"After The Gold Rush\\", and \\"Southern Man\\" have become classic rock staples that get as much airplay today as they did in 1970 which is really amazing when you think about it.  The album featured a then unknown Nils Lofgren on guitar and keyboards who would go on to be a permanent member of Bruce Springsteen's E-street band.  Overall I find this album a bit hit and miss.  Although songs like \\"When You Dance I Can Really Love\\" are beloved by the Neil faithful, they have never done that much for me.  This one probably is essential if you are collecting Neil Young albums, but I this one is only a 4 star release for me.
B0000AZJXQ|3.0|A Perfect Circle...yet another genius idea from Maynard James Keenan that was not executed properly. The idea behind A Perfect Circle was to create a more mainstream Tool really. And in a sense he succeded. His lyrics are just as radical as ever but the usage of James Iha as a guitarist gives the music a much more mainstream appeal and feel.<br /><br />The Thirteenth Step album as a whole is a mixed bad. For ever genius song there is an awful evil counter part somewhere else on the album with the exact same structure that kills the album from being better. It's dissapointing to say the least. Rather than go through the entire album, I feel the highlights should be mentioned while knowing that everything else is basically a throw away. 'The Package' and the single 'Weak And Powerless' open the album fantastically. 'Blue' is stellar as is the unbelieveably angry 'The Outsider' which features some fantastic guitar work from Iha. 'The Nurse Who Loved Me' while good would have fit much better on say...a Pucifer release. 'Pet' is the strongest track on the album hands down. Kennans performance and set of lyrics are some of his all time best, while it's Iha's insanly simple yet powerful guitar riff that carries the entire track into an entirely different world.<br /><br />Thirteenth Step is worth checking out but I'm not so sure it's worth buying and spending all that money on....I don't know.

B000P0J06U|4.0|As far as I'm concerned, this film was a VAST improvement over the first, empty, Spielbergian Batman movie, what with its horrific miscasting of Jack Nicholson as the Joker, the screwing up of the legend of who really killed Bruce Wayne's parents, (it was a character named Joey Chill, NOT Jack Napier,) not to mention Michael Keaton's poor reading of Bruce Wayne. I've wondered for quite a while why they didn't use Tim Curry or the guy who played YOUNG Jack Napier in the movie to play the Joker instead!<br /><br />This time, while the legend was STILL fiddled with a bit too much, it was compensated for by the excellent acting of Michelle Pfeiffer as Catwoman, a better script than the first film, and a generally less \\"slapped-together\\" look to it. Pfeiffer is a revelation as Catwoman/Selina Kyle, taking a vacation from her usual \\"nice girl\\" roles as the definitely mentally askew pseudo-nemesis of Batman. It's actually a little difficult to fully realize that it's Pfeiffer under that mask, the character is so against type for her.<br /><br />Danny Devito's Penguin is another matter altogether. Who conceived of the Penguin this way in Burton's camp? I have NEVER, repeat, NEVER seen the Penguin portrayed as a sewer-dwelling misfit riding herd on a band of ex-circus performers! Penguin's modus operandi has always been to steal and/or obsess over valuable objets d'arte pertaining to aviary subject matter. Here, he's a bedraggled adult orphan tending to Gotham's oddballs in the bowels of its sewer system....And where did Max Shrek come from? I love Devito's comedy in other films, most notably the \\"Romancing the Stone\\" movies, but I think they did the character an injustice here.<br /><br />However, it all comes together MUCH better than the first movie, which was rushed to the screen and looked it. The tension between Batman/Bruce Wayne and Catwoman/Selina Kyle works well, specifically when they're fighting each other in mufti.<br /><br />Christopher Walken's Max Shrek is a strutting villain made specifically for the movie, (and named after the actor who portrayed Nosferatu in the original movie of the same name,) who works just fine as the catalyst that makes Penguin REALLY dangerous and who also helps turn Selina Kyle into Catwoman by attempting to murder her by pushing her out a window. One of the funniest lines in the movie is when Shrek realizes that Selina IS Catwoman and utters the immortal line: \\"Selina...? Selina KYLE?! You're FIRED!\\" after she's dragged him into an electric relay station to exact revenge for trying to kill her and Batman/Bruce finds them in the same place.<br />,<br />This movie is MUCH more substantial than the first one. It's very similar to the difference between the first, useless, Spielbergian Star Trek TMP movie and the MUCH better Wrath of Khan. I HIGHLY recommend this one rather than the first in the series.ically for the movie, (and named after the actor who portrayed Nosferatu in the original movie of the same name,) who works just fine as the catalyst that makes Penguin REALLY dangerous and who also helps turn Selina Kyle into Catwoman by attempting to murder her by pushing her out a window.

0307463745|5.0|Best business book I have read since Purple Cow 10 years ago. So much of what Jason and David write about is obvious, common sense, and known to all of us... so why do so many of us having difficulty in doing what they say?  I have run my own business for 12 years, quite successfully. This book engaged me from page one and served as a giant wake-up call to re-evaluate practically everything I have been doing in order to become even better... and to enjoy the journey more. The writing style is simple, clear and compelling. Read this book and then do what it says.
B001C4CI8U|5.0|I cannot stress the importance enough. If you do not want to read this entire review, please jump ahead to the most important part, titled \\"What it's About.\\" Prepare to be enticed.    The pros:    - $20 for 7 DVDs ($2.87 for each DVD)  - highly creative and original series  - one of the few series that will challenge your knowledge and strain your brain (read \\"What it's About\\" below to know what I mean);    to put it simply, it makes you think  - it is not like Lost in the way that it makes you overthink and fills you with too many questions (you will not get lost); you WILL    have questions, but your questions will always be answered by the end of the episode (there are individual mysteries for each    episode and only ONE SINGLE overarching mystery) that we learn more about with each episode)  - the cast is great (personally, my favorite is the character named Walter Bishop, portrayed by John Noble)  - it doesn't really have ups and downs (it's no roller coaster of success); each episode seems to always be better than the last  - it has some chase scenes and whatnot for you action lovers  - it's like the super fun, captivating science class you've always wanted!  - rather essential to have watched in order to watch its superb second season (yes, the second season, somehow, manages to outdo this    one)   - read \\"What it's About\\" for more info/enticement    The cons:    - could be too difficult for some to wrap their mind around (yes, please do take that as a CHALLENGE)  - rather difficult to get into (give it a chance, you'll evetually come to realize its awesomeness; even I took awhile to come around)  - some may consider it to start off too slowly (I know I did, but trust me, the pace quickens with each episode)    What it's About:    (HIGHLY IMPORTANT TO READ AND HIGHLY INFORMATIVE; IF YOU READ NOTHING ELSE, PLEASE READ THIS DESCRIPTION!)    It's called Fringe for a reason: because the show revolves around the fringes (boundaries) of science. Most of the science involved would probably be filed under Top Secret in government facilities, if not completely theoretical science. In fact, some of the \\"science\\" involved is so out there and on the fringe that you could almost call it fiction-like. So, it should appeal to both spectrums of viewers. It's real and believable enough that it will appeal to the grounded people, the realists, but it's also bizarre and far enough out there that it is fiction-like and will appeal to those who prefer fantastic, almost supernatural ideas (so yes, it's science fiction, literally). As mentioned in the pros, each episode has its own individual mystery in which some incredible scientific occurence is discovered. Like most other TV shows, Fringe follows a basic formula: some scientific phenomenon happens, the FBI and the \\"Fringe team\\" are called to investigate, a little varaition thrown in here and there, mystery is solved, and piece by piece a larger, greater mystery is unveiled. Honestly, I do not believe I am doing the show enough credit. Yes, it follows a formula. But the real frosting on this cake are the scientific mysteries which really are so enthralling, so attention-grabbing and gripping that there is no substitute for an actual firsthand experience of the show.    I feel I've done what I can. I just hope you make the right choice. If you're on the fence about purchasing this, just remember, IT IS A BARGAIN, like I said before. If you decide not to purchase this, you've decided that you won't like it, but how can you know that you won't like it if you've never tried it? You just really don't know what you're missing if you skip it altogether. Make the right choice!
1591843162|4.0|Linchpin is a typical Seth Godin book. By that, I mean you will get some real thought provoking concepts that take a bit of time to consider how best to apply to your real world situations. I like Seth, even if I wasn't able to get into his Alternative MBA course last year ;) Clearly the man knows marketing, and has developed the wonderful ability to produce small tidbits of tasty knowledge deliverable in the perfect bite sized portion.<br /><br />His blog is all about this. His books are simply the same, printed and bound. And that makes for a great teaching style for many individuals. If you are more the type that needs pictures, flow charts, long detailed explanations, this is not the book for you.<br /><br />If instead, you are the type that likes to read a bit and then drift off with your thoughts to contemplate how what you've read applies to your specific situation, you're going to very much enjoy this one.

B002BU0DPE|2.0|This review is about the newly released Turtle Beach Ear Force PX21 Headset.    The sound quality is fine, it sounded similar to what was coming out of my HDTV. The microphone sounds good and you can hear yourself too, which is a nice feature. However, this review is going to be focused on a flaw that I think is game-breaking and completely negates any positives.    I ordered the PX21s in the hope that it fixed the hissing problem that plagued the P21s. In short, it was not fixed at all.    It was exciting to cut open the the clamshell packaging and plug in the P21 to the PS3. However, the second I plugged in the USB cable, I heard the hissing. Some people say they can ignore it; sometimes, I can. But when I'm watching a movie or if I'm listening particularly carefully for sounds in Modern Warfare 2, I can hear the \\"sssssssss.\\"    They have a \\"stereo expander\\" function that supposedly makes it so that the sounds seem to originate from outside the headset. What I've found with the stereo expander is that it makes the sound quality muffled and increases the \\"ssssss\\" hiss to a \\"SSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS\\", about twice as loud with just a minimal benefit in the ability to position people based on sound.    Also, if you don't place the red and white plugs right, there's a noticeable buzzing too! It goes away with the Stereo Expander feature, but again, the hiss is just intolerable with it.    If you're one to be able to ignore very loud hissing, buy these headphones. Otherwise, skip these and get something a little higher end. I might go for the Tritton AX Pro or 720 (since I have a PS3). I hear the Astro A40s are good too, but pretty expensive. This headset is definitely going back to Amazon.

Still, there were glimpses of softening and by a few months in Siberia, even the guards had become prisoners of both the winter and Stalin's inhumanity. This gave rise to escape and the ability of the prisoners to find humanity in fellow prisoners, in the young girl, Kristina, in the assistance provided by farmers, villagers, fishermen and shepherds.  By the time the escapees reached India, humanity was restored.   I was severely disappointed in finding out the story was manufactured, but nevertheless it was a page-turner. Although it should be read as fiction and not reality, the story was a tremendous Odyssey and no less entertaining and thought-provoking than other odysseys. I enjoyed it, notwithstanding the fiction of it.   While the author claimed it was a story about freedom, I found it was a story about man's inhumanity and the restoration of humanity toward man.

1932100660|2.0|I'm a scientist by training and I sought out this book because of the reputation of the author and the sheer size of the study.  But I was bit disappointed by some of the conclusion that were drawn in the book. While there are mountains and mountains of valid data supporting the idea that people who eat a larger percentage of plant based whole foods in their diets  are generally healthier, and that's well supported by this and many other studies. But the author goes much farther, and suggests that the healthiest diet is a completely vegan diet based on whole plant foods.  He even repeatedly suggests that eating just a little meat can be bad for you but neglects any criticisms of the vegan diet like B-12 deficiency.  If the Vegan diet were objectively better then it should be fairly easy to produce a graph comparing strict vegans with moderate vegetarians with heavy duty carnivores and it should be obvious that they live longer and have less of all of these disease. A simple analysis should bear it out.   But he never gave such a study, which should be fairly easy if in fact what he says in true.  For example he mentions that people who eat more meat and dairy get more prostate cancer than people who eat more plant foods,  and the reason he gives is simply meat and dairy contribute to cancer and that's the end. He doesn't even mention the fact that people who eat so much meat and dairy consume significantly less fiber which is a major factor in these cancers.   There is nothing he cites that can make the leap from eat more plants to eat ONLY plants, which he repeatedly does. I agree with the weaker thesis, get most of your nutrition from plants (80-90%) but moderate animal consumption is perfectly healthy and there is even an argument that it's even more healthy than a strict vegan diet.  And he doesn't even talk about fish and seafood or distinguish their nutritional properties from red meat and dairy. He basically considers them the same, but it's fairly obvious that salmon or sardines are more healthy than a hamburger. But to him they are both disease causing animal foods.        The way it's written is with the primary goal to convert you to veganism and not to simply give you the straight science. He should be more cautious in his conclusions. He makes the same kind of logical error that a perons who reads about a particular vitamin being good for you and then goes overboard with it. More is better, which considering his credentials is very very disappointing. He should certainly know better.    He does offer compelling study after compelling study but he merely uses it for self -confirming hypothesis testing and tosses what doesn't jibe.  It's definitely a worthwhile read but his motivation isn't to give you objective science about nutrition, but to convert you to his political agenda, which I think is worthwhile, but a little disingenuous given the stated context of the book. Read it, but with a skeptical eye.  Much better and more objective, I would recommend the World's Healthiest Food Website and as well as the book that is a companion to it. Also if you're looking into pure objective science about food and health you can't do any better than Eat, Drink, and Be Healthy: The Harvard Medical School Guide to Healthy Eating (Paperback) which is based purely on science without a hidden political agenda.
1400052173|4.0|I bought this book because I was fascinated by the idea of cells that wouldn't die. However, I quickly found that this was not only a science story but a complex history of Henrietta's family and the social structures of the day. It was interesting to see how ignorance, superstition, and sociological factors played as much a role as researchers' seeming disregard for a single human in the \\"interest of humanity\\" creating suspicion throughout the family which had to be overcome by the author.    A very good read. My one criticism would be that there is so much detail the story gets a little lost in places. Otherwise I would highly recommend it.
B002ODEJYE|5.0|Lip-synching is dead. P!nk has brought back the art of singing, and done it with a bang. This concert from Australia captures her in full circus mode (literally), belting out her hits while swinging above the audience on a trapeze, among other acts. It's true show(wo)manship and talent, brought to your home in high definition. The whole time, P!nk does two very important things: she never misses a beautiful note, and she has tons of fun.
B000JQUZCI|5.0|Those of you who have preconceived notions about this story because you've seen the Hollywood film versions, read this book.  You'll be pleasantly surprised.  I guarantee it.  This is nothing like the film and so much better.  Shelley, in her brilliance, offers the hideous creature as the one to pity here.  Not Frankenstein, not the townspeople, but the creature.  A sad victim of his creator's selfish ambitions and the prejudices of a naive populace.  In a way, a neglected and abused child, driven to acts of violence and rage as the only release from the agonizing rejection and isolation.  His only real crime was his consuming need for acceptance...a friend...to love and be loved.  This book was so ahead of its time when it was written.  I highly recommend it.  One of my favorites.
0439023483|5.0|This was a terrific book, enjoyed by both my fourteen year-old son and me.  It was an exciting page-turner, with political and psychological overtones.  Sort of a Lord-of-the-Flies meets 1984 meets The Running Man, except with a heroine instead of a hero.  As that description suggests, there is much that is familiar in the story, but, even though part of my brain said \\"I've heard this story before,\\" I found it memorable, fresh and compelling.  The heroine's deep courage, honor and drive are moving because they feel more real than is often the case in books of this genre.  She is far from perfect: impatient, impulsive, vengeful and scarred by her life experiences, and perhaps that is what makes her character so great.  The story is, of course, not realistic, but only at a few points does that lack of plausibility intrude on the tale.  This is the first book in a planned trilogy, and, while much is resolved by the end, enough is left hanging that we moved directly to the sequel.  This book is extremely violent for this kind of genre, and you care, so be warned for younger readers.  For everyone else, warning: you will not be able to put it down.
B000002WPI|5.0|Don't get me wrong, all of the Wu's albums are great, but this album changed the game.  I remember rap was starting to get a little stale back in 1993, with all of the gangsta rap dominating airwaves (don't get me wrong, some of it was great, but it was overload), and then came three of the greatest hip hop albums ever:  Too Short's \\"Get In Where You Fit In\\" (which is probably the FUNKIEST hip hop album ever), ATCQ's \\"Midnight Marauders\\", and this one.  There's not too much that I can say that hasn't been said before, but if this is not in your collection, you are not a true hip hop head.  The beats are on point and so are the rhymes.  There is absolutely no filler on this album.  To me, all of the songs get at least a 9.5 out of 10 for me.  Aside from the singles, my favorite tracks on this album are \\"Clan In Da Front\\", \\"Shame On A .....\\", \\"Tearz\\" and \\"Wu-Tang: 7th Chamber\\".  COP THIS NOW!!
B002PMV9FG|1.0|This movie is horrid. I waited so long to watch this movie, and was really excited to see it. I wasn't a big fan of 'The Order of the Phoenix', but even though alot of the story was changed or left out, it wasn't to the extent of this piece of garbage. From the first scene in which Harry was sitting in a diner getting hit on by a waitress, I knew that things were not looking good. What happened to the opening when Dumbeldore picks up Harry from the Dursley's house, and explains about him having to live in their house until he was 17 in order for him to remain safe? Is that not important to the story? What about Dumbeldores blackened hand, and the mystery behind it? And for goodness sakes, why on earth was that man for Slughorn cast? He didn't fit the description of him at all, and in the beginning in which Dumbeldore takes Harry to 'convince' Slughorn to teach at Hogwarts, is so awkward and with no explanation, it was confusing. So much was left out, Fleur and Bill werent even mentioned or seen in the movie and the next book begins with their wedding. I wonder how that will be explained.. The ending was by far the worst part of the movie ever. You had Harry prowling around while Draco and Snape took care of Dumbeldore and what is really amusing is that nobody seemed to care. Snape strolls out of the school with his Deatheater buddies like theyre going out for a cup of tea and Harry reluctantly follows them. The gripping climatic ending was missing, Dumbeldores funeral was bypassed so that all the wizards and witches could hold up their wands like 'candles in the wind' in memory of Dumbeldore. So LAME!<br /><br />I could go on and on with one scene after the other about how it either wasn't relevant, or was completely changed. Id say that out of a 2 1/2 hour movie, only 10-20 minutes were actual things from the book. I kept on wondering while I was watching this travesty of a film, if I would have liked it if I hadn't read the book; and my conclusion was, NO. The movie was sooo boring, and disjointed with most of the plot left out, jumping from one unexplained scene to the next, and with additions that made absolutely no sense (why was the burrow burned?) Even the characters seemed dull and lifeless. I saw no emotion from anyone, and all the interaction seemed like no one cared.  Maybe they knew that the adapted story was horrendous and they just didn't give a damn. I really don't understand why the movie was vastly different from the book. They really weren't kidding when they said 'based on a novel', 'extremely loosely based' would be a more accurate description. Boo hoo, for the screenwriters and director, this movie was really insulting to Harry Potter fans. If I was able to give it 0 stars I would.ooo boring, and disjointed with most of the plot left out, jumping from one unexplained scene to the next, and with additions that made absolutely no sense (why was the burrow burned?)

0393072231|5.0|I'm someone who is sooooooooooo not interested in the ins and outs of Wall Street, but I saw an interview with the Author that  raised my curiosity. I bought the book, and holy cow, I could not put it down. As many of the reviews have already covered, it follows several people/groups as they stumbled upon the flaw in the machine... and then sought to exploit it.     While it is true that we have all lived thru this as \\"current events\\", there were many terms that I did not understand from the news accounts. Michael Lewis truly has a gift for explaining things such that a small furry animal can understand it.....but at the same time, not talking down to the reader.     At the end of it all, I can see how we got to where we are, and how people were motivated to do what they did - on all sides of the equation. Also, I agree with what Michael Lewis has said, \\"once you know the truth, you can't help but be angry about what happened.\\"    Somewhere on the internet, perhaps on Amazon, you can find the audio of the prologue. Listen to it and you will be hooked. Beg, borrow or steal; but do what you have to do to get a copy of this book.
B000V6I7WG|1.0|This is one of the most overhyped piece of crap ever to be transferred  onto DVD.  Not only was this movie lacking in excitement and/or creativity, but i had to watch it 2-3 times just to see if i missed something.....but it sucked all 3 times. Ever watch a movie so horrible you wish you could reclaim those hours back? This is that movie. Do yourself a favor and don't entertain the idea of watching this. Only a night of ingesting 8 bean burritos laced with laxatives can give you this result. Beware!!!!
B0035V35PI|4.0|Terrific picture and even better sound.  The DTS-HD audio keeps the rear channels very active during action sequence.  The sound really peaks near the end as it handles both continuous, rapid gun fire and flying ninja stars.  Both are clearly and uniquely heard happening at the same time.  There is a subtle film grain present in most scenes, but it does not peak during dark sequences, they are handled very well.      This film is about 50% action and 50% story, a lot of which is told through flashbacks.  The action is very fast yet clear on a TV processing at 120hz.  One scene bothered me a bit in the finale.  Our hero is battling several ninja in a dojo and blood is flying everywhere, yet there is no blood on the floor.  It seems to just dissipate into thin air.  Also, the action wraps up at around 1hr 29mins.  The movie is 99mins so I think were going to get a nice epilogue.  Instead the movie ends about a minute later and we get 9mins of credits.      For me, the holy grail of blood and guts horror films has always been Peter Jackson's Dead Alive.  Although some have claimed to have topped his grizzly visual assault, none have really come close.  The holy grail of blood and guts action films has been Kill Bill, with no close contender.  That is until now.  I would say Ninja Assassin is now a very close second in that context.  Enjoy!
B000F3T7X8|5.0|I have been a fan of Japan and Sylvian for the last 30 years and have to say that this album is undoubtedly the Zenith of all their output .The early albums were not that bad, it is just that they were not that good either , Quiet Life was a mish mash of post Obscure Alternatives pseudo 'Glam / Punk' and their Donna Summer Disco collabrative work with Moroder so it naturally felt somewhat disjointed at times .    Tin Drum although outstanding for it's time not to mention still sounding fresh today already had the feel of a man ready to move on and strike out for pastures new , which ultimately Mr.Sylvian duly did.    So that leaves this body of excellence, what GTP gives you is the resounding beauty of a band that had eventually found it's place and time , gone are the rough edges  , the uncertanties and doubts . Instead what we have here is a collection of finely crafted songs which evoke pure pleasure , Sylvian was at his best and the whole album sits with a comfortable air .    Stand out songs and probably the ones that get the least recognition -  'Swing ' and 'My New Career' - these finally bring together Karn's superb Bass mastery with Barbieri's sublime Synthmanship all glued together by Sylvian and his treacle coated vocals.    My one complaint was the replacement of ' Some Kind of Fool ' with ' Burning Bridges ' , not sure what Sylvian was thinking about but SKoF was far more suited to the overall feel of the album .Anyway do not let this deter you from listening or even better purchasing this great piece of work , if you have never listened to Japan before this album delivers the absolute essence of their time together as a band - enjoy - JW
B00275EGWY|1.0|When this film received so much acclaim and so many \\"big\\" awards this \\"awards season\\" - culminating in the Academy Awards selection(s) as Best Director and even Best Picture, I couldn't wait to rush out and buy (not rent) it.  As a proud US veteran (Vietnam era), and even prouder of my 25+ year career as a \\"hands on\\" VA executive (working directly with wounded, disabled, and deceased veterans and their families (at many different VA Medical Centers, and with the VA National Cemetery system), I have an avid/insatiable interest in military history [especially modern (post-Vietnam)] warfare; and try to satiate that interest by immercing myself as much as possible in books and movies that are suppose to (by reputation) so accurately portray the \\"real\\" world and horrors of insurgent/gorilla warfare of these modern times.  This movie fell FAR SHORT of its high accolades, and I'm sorry to SO STRONGLY FEEL that this movie's accolades (ALL OF THEM) were received under false pretenses, and were a result of EXTREME HOLLYWOOD POLITICING!!!  Before this years' \\"Acadeny Farce\\" show, it had been longer that I care to remember, when I've so strongly felt that a movie's accolades were based purely on politics, without a shred of substance.  They would have been much better off producing a SHORT documentary, and been done with it, would have to nominate this as one of the WORST FILMS OF THE DECADE, if not longer.  I, personally, would give this film \\"two thumbs down\\", and not even rated it one star (above) - if not forced to select at least one.  My advice:  Save your money!  This film is not worth the price of admission, purchase, or even rental fee.  I was SO BORED that it was all I could do to keep my eyes open throughout; and in order to keep awake, (always hopeful that it would HAVE TO eventually get better) I had to do something to keep my mind alert; so I gathered up some Kentucky Revised Statutes (law documents) to read while finishing watching this seemingly never-ending journey into numbing boredom.  It's pretty sad (and bad) when law book jargon proves to be more interesting than a war film.  This is definitely a \\"MUST MISS\\" flick.rney into numbing boredom.

Currently using it strictly in a linux installation. Was problematic at first, now works 95% of the time... rarely gpsd gets to be a little bit of a bugger and won't lock onto anything -- telnetting into it tells me it's refusing to get any signal.    sometimes it takes a minute or two to reaquire the location you're at, and it seems to update my navit a TINY bit slow, telling me where i was 5 meters ago, rather than where I currently am, but all GPS' must work this way?    Regardless, it's a great little device and [...] bucks for a 100+ GPS navigation system? Yes! thank you!

B0006Z2KX4|5.0|Bringing Up Baby was originally made in 1938, and still brings constant gut laughter.  Katharine Hepburn plays Susan, a scatterbrained heiress, and Cary Grant plays Dr. David Huxley,  a serious paleontologist who just wants to complete his brontosaurus skeleton and marry a straight-laced prude, Miss Swallow (Virginia Walker).  Dr. Huxley has immediate plans to marry Miss Swallow, as well as complete his brontosaurus skeleton the next day.  His life is quiet, boring and predictable.<br /><br />Dr. Huxley also has plans to ask for a million dollars from a wealthy donor.  A golf outing is scheduled and into his life comes lunatic Susan, a giddy, unfocused, spur-of-the moment beautiful young woman that says and does anything that comes to mind.  She starts a madcap fun ride of jokes, trouble, constant ridiculous situations, especially when a pet leopard named \\"Baby\\" comes into her life.  David keeps getting sucked into her exciting, free-spirited ways, and Susan wants to keep him near.  She finds him endearing and yet David is always sputtering about her causing him trouble.  Katharine Hepburn and Cary Grant are the perfect comedy team, and the screwball antics are fabulous fun from running around a country estate trying to find a lost leopard and dinosaur bone to everyone being jailed for being crazy or members of a mob.<br /><br />Bringing Up Baby is a vintage film worth watching for a hysterical laughter lift.
B001FB55H6|3.0|As a work of cinematic art, the Watchmen is, in my opinion, a masterpiece.  The acting, the directing, the cinematography, the FX and of course, staying so true to the original story.  The problem for me was the blu ray disk itself. So far I've had 3 copies and none of them functioned well.  I can't access the menu until the movie is over, the sound keeps going out of synch with the video (requiring some creative button pushing to fix each time) and the so-called immersive maximum movie mode doesn't work. I just recently got a firmware update and as this is the only disc I'm having trouble with, I'm inclined to think there's something wrong with the manufacturing of this disk.

0786838655|5.0|The \\"Percy Jackson and the Olympians\\" series is one of the best book series I have ever read in my entire life. The first one, The Lightning Thief, is among one of my favorites, out of the whole series. It's intense, hilarious, and luring. Once you begin, you will not want to stop. I, myself, have read this book multiple times. Probably at least twelve times. This book never gets boring, or uninteresting. I can, and am doing so, read the entire series over and over again. Even though you already know what's gonna happen, it is always as suspenseful as ever. Plus, while being entertained, you also learn much about Greek mythology. I suspect that in your eagerness, you will research about all the different Greek myths. That's what I did, of course. ;)
0061914177|4.0|First, understand I am not denigrating Gary Vaynerchuk's book in any way. If you are unfamiliar with the concepts he writes about, this is the book for you. If tough to read books filled with difficult concepts to conceive give you fits, this is the book for you because it is simple, straight forward and to the point, albeit on the light side.<br /><br />I've met GaryVee on a couple of occasions and have actually gotten emails to and from him. I like Gary, and if you're doing anything online, you will like him too. His WineLibrary.TV success aside, his book's contents left me with the yearning for the rest of the book. It almost felt to me that he wrote a detailed outline or treatment, and that is ultimately what was published.<br /><br />This is, however, a great book for the millions of people that do not spend 6, 8, 10, 15 hours a day online doing all of the things Gary does talk about. If you want to learn what it's all about, read this book. If you know a little bit about the online world, e-commerce, social media, online video, read this book.<br /><br />If you are looking for a detailed, step by step plan, my guess is this book will leave you wanting for more.

B001TOVZYQ|3.0|The movie itself is wonderful.  As usual Donnie Yen doesn't disappoint with his martial arts skills.  The story, while not entirely accurate captures the essence of Ip Man and the wing chun system.  Good showing with no complaints there.      The bad part is the the DVD quality is grainy. It's still watchable, but the bad quality is noticeable straight away.  There were other freezes in the DVD as well, only lasting for a moment.  Then halfway through the DVD completely froze, and when I tried to skip forward or backward the film would skip the some random point.      I'm having another disc sent to me as I write this.  Hopefully this copy will not have the playback flaws.  I'm sure though the grainyness will still be there though.      This is one disc where it might be worth going blue ray.
B002UXRGM0|5.0|I had watched the original British airing of this, and it simply takes my breath away. Planet Earth was, to me, a revolutionary documentary experience, and Life brings it up a notch. It astounds me how some of the images are able to be caught on film in such a masterful way, it almost seems as if they train the animals for the camera with how well it's captured. It is simply awe-inspiring.    I cannot wait to see how much more beautiful it looks in pristine High Definition.      One thing has me confused - why is Amazon showing the runtime as 144 minutes? These are ten 50 minute episodes, each with a 10 minute \\"behind the scenes\\" extra. So it should be around 600 minutes...

The only criticism I have is the first half of the book spent to much time on petty details whereas the 2nd half moved too fast in places.<br />It was an interesting read and makes me want to go visit Sweden. Theres probably a few things in the book that don't translate a 100%, and the book I had also had some words spelled differently than regular english. But I didn't mind that. The ending was a bit abrupt and I can't wait now to read The Girl Who Played with Fire.<br />There might be a few cliches in the book, but the characters are anything but cliche. The girl, Lisbeth, is just so unique. She's not lovable and cute, but she is interesting and mysterious. This book had several surprises and many things weren't as one might guess. Some people might not like some of the things in this book relating to sadism or murder, but thats kind of what the books about.

B002UZCJ8Y|5.0|A futuristic movie about humans living out their dreams of living a perfect life through surogates. A life where you never get old and nothing bad ever happens to you. Until one day, there is a murder in this special world and  Bruce Willis' character begins to investigate and find answers not only about the case but about his own life living through a surrogate.
B000ECX0QU|4.0|This is an odd film, but definitely one of the better ones of his late 60s efforts.  The pace is slow, there are no big stars, it is embedded in a historical drama related to real events, i.e. the Cuban missile crisis. There is also an array of excellent French actors, who speak only in heavily accented English.  Nonetheless, it is a very good film, if not a great one.<br /><br />The main character is a French intelligence operative, who operates in close cooperation with the CIA and is a kind of maverick.  He is extremely good at what he does and has a system of his own operatives and collaborators set up.  As he gets involved in an investigation at the behest of the CIA, he comes into contact with crude Cuban revolutionaries (one of them finds a diplomatic dispatch wrapped around a half-eaten hamburger), uses an affair to get information about Russian missile placements in Cuba, and then fights to find a conspiracy (and at the same time save his career) in Paris.  He operates in environments that mix elegant style with the saddest brutalities and constant threats, often humorously portrayed.<br /><br />As always, the details and imagery are quirky, unusual, and unexpected.  While the plot is a bit pedestrian, the intrigue and off-hand humor are wonderful.<br /><br />Recommended.  Not Hitch's best, but the best of his late efforts.
B000PMLFRA|1.0|I was a huge Star Wars fan when I saw it as a kid in 1977. Then I remember exactly where I was when Empire came out and my friends told me that Darth Vader might be Lukes father. Then I saw the Empire poster and Han was making out with Leia. Wow and I thought Luke would get the princess! Then Jedi came out and it was cool but sort of felt a little \\"Muppety\\" and cute. But I still liked it. Many years passed then the Episode I trailer came out and I watched it over and over again - frame by frame - I eagerly waited for the weekly mystery photo to come out on Star [...] and examined it from top to bottom. It was mind-blowingly exciting up until after the EP1 Lucasfilm logo played on opening day and everyone cheered.     What happened after that was the biggest disappointment of my life - Star Wars got lame. Really lame. Annie? Annies mom? Jar-Jar? Barfff! King George was drunk with power and none of his associates obviously had the the guts to give him any constructive feedback and Episodes 1, 2, and 3 were stupid cornballs. Bottom line, Star Wars was much better a long time ago in a Galaxy far, far away. I long to have that feeling back - the original version - not the stupid CG makeover one. And please don't make VII, VIII, and IX. I cant take any more disappointment.     It pains me to say this, but I've moved on. Too painful to look back or relive.

B001FB5634|5.0|I loved the novel of [[ASIN:B001OV2GRE The Road]] and also thoroughly enjoyed the adaptation of Cormac McCarthy's other novel [[ASIN:B0011BE3K0 No Country for Old Men [Blu-ray]]]so I couldn't wait to see this one. It stars Viggo Mortensen as \\"The Man\\" who has survived the apocalypse and is now taking care of his young son and trying to keep them both alive, struggling against exhaustion, starvation and cannibals. I knew from reading the book that this wouldn't be a happy film, in fact you couldn't get much further from it. That doesn't stop it from being an exciting and heartbreaking film exploring man's will to survive and the love that he has for his son.     The film is beautifully shot, being partly filmed in post-Katrina New Orleans (as well as Pennsylvania, Louisiana and Oregon, I believe), the scenery is bleak, cold and depressing and most importantly authentically destroyed land, but is equally breathtaking and extremely atmospheric. Acting from Mortensen and Kodi Smit-McPhee is very believable and their bond together did feel genuine to me and mirrored the characters of the novel perfectly. The story is just about survival a coping with the end of the world, basically - nothing more, nothing less. I particularly liked how you never really know why the whole of the human race has been wiped out, so that part of the story is left completely up to you to decide or guess.     The Road is a very haunting and quite powerful film that is very faithful to the novel, but didn't quite make the impact that the book did as it is always harder to feel what the characters do in a movie as opposed to using your own imagination when reading their emotions in a well written piece of literature. This is no fault of the film though, so don't let that put you off. I definitely rate this highly and will most certainly purchase it on Blu Ray or DVD when it is released.
B002ZG997C|3.0|Man I dig these types of movies and books. Post holocaust. Too bad the long running series Deathlands can't have been made into a movie like dis.    The two black directors here are solid filmmakers. Dead presidents was kickin it old school. If you havent seen that film, then you need to check it out.    Although way better than Legion, Book of Eli still needed a bit more action in it. The commercials sold it like that, but it needed more. But when Denzel was slicin and dicin - it was bad to the bone!    Like to have seen some mutants.    But still worth seeing if you dig action movies.     Eric is outtttt....

B00386EZJU|5.0|DreamWorks couldn't have found a better composer for this film when they brouht John Powell on board.  Already with scores for Shrek and Horton Hears a Who under his belt, Powell does a terrific job with this 25-track album.<br /><br />Most of the score contains classic orchestration; largely strings with plenty of woodwinds.  The songs are generally upbeat, and the soundtrack grows thunderous as the film progresses.  While the movie takes place in the mythical island of Berk, songs like \\"New Tail\\" and \\"This is Berk\\" have a pleasant Celtic twist to them.<br /><br />The more offbeat instrumentation in the album includes the East Indian sitar in \\"Dragon Book\\", and the xylophone in \\"Forbidden Friendship.\\"  A few inclusions in the album also incorporate an intense chorus, such as the Danny Elfman vibed \\"Wounded\\".  Speaking of other composers, I also enjoyed \\"Romantic Flight\\", a hopeful and inspiring song that is almost a throwback to the older work of James Horner.<br /><br />The most distinct song on the album isn't by John Powell, it's the falsetto pop-rock \\"Sticks and Stones\\" that plays during the credits.  It's appropriate for a movie with vikings, as it was recorded exclusively for the soundtrack by Icelandic singer J&oacute;nsi of Sigur R&oacute;s.  Little trivia: director Dean Deblois also shot a film of J&oacute;nsi performing one of his albums, which might help to explain the connection.<br /><br />The more lively songs on the album seem to stick to the same melody, but the album doesn't feel too repetitious.  It's amazing to watch Powell do a great job composing for Green Zone, and immediately follow it up with a beautiful score for a fun children's film.  Another must-have album for soundtrack aficionados.
0439023491|3.0|Let me first start on the supposedly love triangle in this book. In the first book, we only have a few pages of Katniss talking to her best friend Gale (few meaning, maybe around 5 pages or so). We then completely forget about Gale in the first book and we get a lot of Peeta instead. Now in the second book, Katniss is suddenly saying she wants Gale, and doesn't want anyone else to have him, and how could she be so blind and never see it before? Blahblahblah, we still see Gale only in flashbacks (yes .. flashbacks), and on another few pages. The rest is still Peeta.<br /><br />Now I'm supposed to be rooting for Katniss and Gale? What kind of love triangle is this? Not only do I loathe love triangles, this one is just pathetically written. We barely see Gale, yet we're supposed to believe Katniss really cares for him. Then we're supposed to believe that Peeta loves Katniss, even though she's a selfish, whiny girl who would kill him if it ever suited her.<br /><br />Katniss became very whiny and selfish in this book. She lost her spunk from the first book, the one where she didn't care she was being honest to herself and kill anyone she'd like. Now she's telling herself that she needs to save her family! Because otherwise they'd be killed, because of her! She muses about Gale and the complications of a relationship with him. Then she talks about running away, like a big fat coward. Then she needs to make sure Peeta stays alive, not because she likes/loves him, but because she owes him big time. Ugh, this whiny selfish girl was really annoying to read about the entire time. Where did Katniss go from the first book?<br /><br />Then there's the Quarter Quell (or something), just another Hunger Games in disguise. Katniss and Peeta are thrown into the Quarter Quell because the author has lost any ideas for the plot, and guesses, hey the first book did so well, let's throw them back in there! It was horrible. It wasn't exciting like the first book. The first book made you very aware of Katniss's weaknesses, and that she needed water and food constantly, and be on the look out of other tributes. This quarter quell is about nothing but gaining allies (that she didn't want anyway), she gets weapons first before water, and water and food are easily thrown in her lap because of the sponsors. The only threat they really have, is the actual Gamemakers trying to kill them with monsters/lightning etc. The quarter quell also happens in the third part of the book, so it's written as if the author was in a rush, and it really feels sloppy.<br /><br />Now ... those were the annoying parts of the book. Which brought it down to a 3 star rating. The pathetic love triangle, the whiny main character, and the sloppy written Quarter Quell.<br /><br />The best part of the book is easily Peeta, he makes reading this whole thing worth it. He's the most sympathetic and honest character in the whole book. You can't help but root for him, but you have to wonder what a great guy like him, sees something in the whiny and selfish girl Katniss. He still loves her, and would give his life for her ... for some reason. Even so, Peeta is the light and heart of this story. Without him, all we'd be reading about are unsympathetic characters who are trying to overthrow the capitol. Like Katniss says, he's good with words, and he is. Reading about Peeta definitely makes everything feel lighthearted and safe, because Peeta protects everyone and is the big, lovable guy in the bunch.<br /><br />Then there's the rebels trying to overthrow the capitol. It starts very ... very slowly in the beginning. If you weed out the whining of the main character, you can see that the districts are trying to stand up against the capitol, but because they are all separated, none of the districts know about the others trying to rebel. There's a lot of corrupt politicians involved, and people working undercover. Katniss's symbol, the Mockingjay, has now become the rebel's symbol. For some reason, Katniss has become the starting point of the rebels, and she is now the anchor to the overthrow. I don't know why, as Katniss really is nothing special, I'd figured Peeta would be the one who wins people to his side, not Katniss.<br /><br />Either way, Catching Fire is just a bridge book between the first and last. I really want to know what happens next, as I expect the capitol to go down, a few characters get killed, and I'm hoping to god that the author decides to throw away the silly love triangle, and just decide on Katniss's partner already (or none, as that would suit her more). Catching Fire is just something to read for fans of the first book, so that they can wait until the third one comes out.<br /><br />Had Catching Fire ever stood alone as a single book, I would have undoubtedly given this a 1, as this feels so incomplete, rushed, and filled with characters who are such backstabbing bastards and really don't invoke any sympathy in me. However, I give it a 3 star rating because it continues to the story of the first book, and Peeta is still in there to save the story. Let's just hope he'll be int he third book as well.n, Katniss has become the starting point of the rebels, and she is now the anchor to the overthrow.

B001PU8N0I|5.0|The story, although centered on a depressing topic, is brilliantly and delightfully told, a story more about hope than despair, even though there was plenty of that around as well. It's easy to care about what happens to the characters from the beginning. Amy finds beauty in everything and everyone. Others find beauty in her in spite of the drab surroundings. As usual with a Charles Dickens novel, all is not exactly as it seems. There is much more hidden within the lives of these amazing characters. This classic novel comes to life as portrayed by these excellent actors.<br /><br />Amy or \\"Little Dorrit\\" is desperately poor, spending most of her life caring for her father who is in debtor's prison, a place we get to know well throughout the story. Amy is, in spite of her circunmstances, a lady, as her father, who has become emotionally unstable over the years in debtor's prison,  constantly reminds her. Surrounded in poverty and wearing her one old ragged dress, she speaks modestly but elegantly, as if she had received an excellent education, which she apparently did, from her father. Amy moves through her many duties with grace, and wins respect from everyone who observes her, rich or poor. Her sweet, unselfish disposition and the fact that she takes care of everyone else,  makes viewers love her as well, and want to protect her from the dangers and insults we see around her. For example, when she got locked out of the debtor's prison and had to seek refuge off a street full of ruffians on a cold staircase, Amy never uttered a complaint. She was more concerned with the welfare of her friend, who was 'slow' mentally and unable to take care of herself. She moves gracefully and purposefully, never questioning why she has been given such a tough life situation.<br /><br />I had heard of debtor's prisons all my life, but never had a handle on what they really were. Very interesting, and not at all what I would have thought. The atmosphere, with the streets teeming with people selling whatever they could find to sell, potatoes, violets, etc., effectively set the stage for this story. A number of intriguing characters interact in surprising ways as the complicated plot makes its twists and turns, characters interesting enough to make us care what happens to them, good and bad.<br /><br />Does good triumph over evil in this story? You'll have to read the novel, watch the DVD, or both, to find out. It's worth your time.<br /><br />I wasn't ready for the story to be over and found myself wishing Dickens, and the screenwriter and producer had given us a Little Dorrit II.hatever they could find to sell, potatoes, violets, etc., effectively set the stage for this story.

B0036EBARO|1.0|I've been a fan of Goldfrapp ever since Felt Mountain. I loved Black Cherry and Supernature. When I heard Seventh Tree I was disappointed but learned to see her creative side to that album. However, Head First is the worst album she has ever done. It sounds like 80's pop gone wrong! It doesn't sound anything like her prior styles. This album is the worst album she has ever done. If you are a fan of Felt Mountain, Black Cherry or Supernature you shouldn't buy this album because it doesn't sound anything like the Goldfrapp we know and loved.
B000K1P66W|5.0|Here they are:    1.  Be impeccable with your word    2.  Assume nothing - don't make assumptions    3.  Don't take anything or anyone (including yourself!) personally    4.  Always do your best    Even though I have set out the four agreements described in the book, it is very much worth reading.  The writer describes the agreements through \\"Toltec wisdom\\" which is pretty cool.  I particularly found helpful the notion that we all live according to our own personal \\"dream\\" and that we can change our experience by changing the dream we live by, which is premised on thousands of agreements, many of which we accept unwittingly and to our detriment.  The reason you can't take anyone personally is because they are acting according to their personal dream, hence their actions (or lack thereof) have nothing to do with you.  And for the same reason, you cna't make assumptions.  The writer discusses other issues, such as the Judge, who condemns us and creates shame in us, by utilizing the faulty/detrimental agreements that make up our personal dream.    This book is transformative.

B001OST0LW|3.0|Batman Forever.  The first Batman movie that was not directed by Tim Burton, and did not feature Michael Keaton in the lead role.  Because of this, the tone of the movie is very different.  It is noticeably less dark than either of the two Burton films.  Batman Returns got a lot of parental backlash because it scared the crud out of many younger kids.  With this movie, Joel Schumacher tried to make a Batman movie that the kids could enjoy, while still appealing to adults.  The result is kind of a go-between between Burton's two previous movies and Batman and Robin.  This movie starts to revert back to the camp of the 60s television show, but they still put in some dark subplots, like Bruce re-living his parent's death, or Robin losing his family and wanting revenge.  Most fans will criticize this as the prelude to Batman and Robin, and the end of that Batman movie series, but I still think this movie has some qualities to it.    The plot has a lot of things going on.  Two-Face, played by Tommy Lee Jones, is introduced in the opening scene.  He wants revenge on Batman (it is never really explained why, does he blame Batman for his condition?) and he pursues this vendetta throughout the story.  The Riddler, played by Jim Carrey, is obsessed with mind control.  He invented some kind of box that beams television signals directly into the human brain.  He can then read people's minds, and extract information.  Bruce Wayne initially rejected his idea, and so Riddler harbors a grudge.  Batman, played by the bland, emotionless Val Kilmer, is reliving his parent's death in his dreams.  He is starting to doubt if he wants to continue to be Batman.  He is also starting to date Chase Meridian, played by Nicole Kidman, probably the only actor in this movie who knew what she was doing.  Robin, played by Chris O'Donnell, makes his first appearance onto the big screen.  His parents were killed by Two-Face, and he wants revenge.  Bruce takes him in when he has no place to go, and begins to guide him.  In my opinion the plot had too many subplots.  There just wasn't enough time to develop one individual character.  Many of the motivations for these characters are either underexplained, or just plain silly.  For instance, it is never really revealed what Bruce's dream is about.  In the novelization, he remembers as a kid looking in his father's journal and reading that the reason his parents were murdered is because they were taking him to the movies.  He feels guilty about this, and understandably so.  In the actual movie, however, this is never revealed.  Bruce is talking to Nicole Kidman, and he is about to tell her.  Then they start making out.  This entire plot point is never mentioned again.  The Riddler, after having Bruce Wayne reject his idea, turns into a supervillian.  He goes completely insane and decides to kill his boss and steal everyone's mind.  Two-Face, whose back story is only revealed in a brief video clip, is way too silly.  He does his best worst Joker impersonation in my opinion, and is always jumping around laughing and cackling like a lunatic.  Harvey Dent is supposed to be one of the more tragic characters in the Batman universe, but here he's just a joke.  He doesn't really come across as evil.  Along those lines, I didn't care much for Jim Carrey's performance as the Riddler.  He's just playing his roles from The Mask and Ace Venturra all over again.  He, along with Two-Face, is far too silly to be viewed as a villain.  But I suppose it fit with what they were trying to do: make a lighter Batman movie that was mainly aimed at kids.  Val Kilmer made an adequate Batman, I guess.  The problem was, he did his Batman growl throughout the entire movie, whether he had his mask on or off.  And he seemed bored with the role, like he was about to fall asleep.  Say what you want about George Clooney's performance, at least he seemed like he was having fun with the role.  One positive thing I have to talk about, which doesn't really reflect Kilmer's performance, is the action scenes.  The action scenes are much better this time around.  I know some of the scenes were cheesy, like the scene with the bank vault near the beginning, or the part where Batman drives the Batmobile up the side of the building.  But I mean the hand-to-hand stuff.  Of the three actors to play Batman in the 90s movie series, Val Kilmer is really the only one who can play an action hero.  In Michael Keaton's movies, the action scenes were not very good.  This was caused primarily by the fact that Michael Keaton is not much of an action hero.  There were other reasons, such as the restrictive batsuit (which was finally changed in this movie) or the fact that Tim Burton cannot direct action scenes very well (this isn't a knock on Burton.  He's a good director, action just isn't his genre).  But wheras Michael Keaton was kind of small and skinny, Val Kilmer was big and muscular, which you kind of need to be to beat up seven or eight guys by yourself.  The fight choreography was pretty good this time around.  People might say that I'm spending too much time focusing on the action scenes, when there is more to the movie than that.  But seriously, Batman is supposed to be one of the best martial artists in the world.  In Burton's movies, I could have beaten that Batman in a fight.  Don't get me wrong, as far as performances go, Kilmer's performance is not equal to Keaton's.  But with all the mistakes this movie made, it's good to know they at least did this one small detail better.  The character people usually tend to regard as the low point of the film is Robin.  Because of these movies, many people to this day cannot stand Robin, and regard him as a worthless character.  That is simply not true.  Chris O'Donnel is not playing Dick Grayson, he's playing Jason Todd, the second Robin.  Jason was a whiny cry-baby, who got so intolerably annoying that they killed off his character.  Dick Grayson is not supposed to be this bigof an annoyance.  He's supposed to be an interesting character, and kind of a foil for Batman.  Robin was originally created because the writers of the Batman comics were worried that Batman was becoming too dark.  So they created a young character to be youthful and lighthearted and brighten up the story.  That could have worked very well for what they were trying to do with this movie, make a Batman movie that more kids could enjoy.  Robin is supposed to be a very likeable character, and instead we got someone who rivals Anakin Skywalker as the insufferable protagonist.    Whining about his dead family, lording it over Bruce after he saved his life, and ordering Bruce to train him to be his partner.  Many people say they hate Robin in general, simply because of these movies.  If that is you, I ask you to reevaluate your opinion of Robin.  He is a pretty interesting character, they just messed him up here.  In conclusion, this is a very average film.  It is considered a bad movie, because many people misunderstand it.  It is kind of silly and campy, but they wanted to make it a movie for kids to enjoy.  They really tried to find a balance between being dark and creepy and being silly and cheesy.  In my opinion, they did a pretty good job, for what they were trying to do.  It wasn't like the following movie where they went completely insane and did the most outlandish things they could think of.  The most important question to ask yourself when watching a movie like this is \\"was I entertained?\\"  And yes, I was entertained.  I've even gone back and watched it a few more times over the years.

B002LFPAUC|4.0|No need to discourse on the merits of Fawlty Towers. I bought this set merely for the John Cleese commentaries, and I was not, for the most part, disappointed. His reminiscences about the regular cast members as well as the guests are really enjoyable, but the insights about the show's creation were unenlightening. His commentary was often incommoded by his laughter while he watched the episodes. This laughter was regularly accompanied by a horrid wracking cough which made me want to turn off the feature. The other special features were basically transferred from the previous box-set. The remastering was clear in both picture and sound. If you do not already own the F.T. box set, I would buy this one for the remastering and the previously unavailable commentaries (if you can handle John's coughing fits).
B0034JKZ86|4.0|I will have to admit that this movie never really garnered my interest so I didn't take my girl's to see it at the theaters, they went with their mom and friends. They came back very happy with it so when the DVD was released of course Dad had to buy it. And with the purchase, Dad was also forced into watching it. And to be completely honest, I was entertained.   It was funny, colorful, the songs are contagious, and most importantly the characters have something important to say. Triana is one of the few Disney heroines that actually does something in order to come out on top at the end (let's face it Snow White and Sleeping Beauty just laid there waiting for their prince to come and save them, don't get me wrong I still love those movies but there's no denying that that's basically what they did). The \\"Princess\\" in this movie wish's on a star but then remarks that wishing can really get you nowhere if you don't work hard. I find this a good lesson for my daughter's to hear, and they are having fun while learning it.  I don't give it 5 stars because I really do not believe it can actually live up to some of my favorite Disney movies ( The Little Mermaid, Beauty and the Beast) but it is worth having.
0515142247|5.0|Well written.  His character, Jack Reacher is great.  I have read all of his Reacher books.  I could enter a Reacher trivia contest.  Example, he likes his coffee in a relatively thin sided cup.  Thick sided ones cool the coffee too much.  Reacher is a man's man.
1439190275|5.0|This book is a great step in the wonderful Atkins legacy.     I've read a lot of the studies cited in this book, and am looking forward to researching the cornucopia of scientific studies cited in it.      Atkins turned the nutritional field on it's head almost forty years ago when he published his initial book. But he was NOT the creator of the low-carb diet.  Doctors were putting people on the low-carb diet in the 1800s after they found that too much bread and ale were causing obesity.  It wasn't until the 1950s that the field of nutrition was subverted  by Ansel Keyes and his followers.  Low carb is NOT the \\"fad diet\\" of today. Low-Fat is the fad diet. A costly fad diet that is killing MILLIONS of us from diabetes, high blood pressure and heart disease.     A LOT of the anti-Atkins people say \\"I knew someone that was on Atkins and they had XXX health problems because of it.\\"  The question to ask is...HOW did they do Atkins? Did they only eat meat, cheese and eggs? If so they WERE NOT DOING ATKINS.  Atkins requires 12-15 grams of NET carbs (total - fiber) from VEGGIES every single day.  It also recommends that you get 25-30 grams of fiber per day.  What is unhealthy about that?       This book was incredibly well written and did a great job of pulling together some of the groundbreaking scientific studies that have been done that DO prove that low-carb is a phenomenal tool to reduce risk factors such as high blood sugar, cholesterol and high blood pressure.     I did find things that I disagreed with in the book such as the recommendation to not weigh your food, but that is minutia, and each individual will find tools that work for them.     If you want to understand how the nutrional field got so screwed up, a good book to read is Gary Taubes' \\"Good Calories, Bad Calories\\".
0316067598|5.0|I've read other stories about our nations special forces soldiers and patriots but this one is very much worth the read. It has given me a much deeper appreciation for the US Navy Seals. It was also a very courageous story of struggle and sacrifice in the face of impossible odds. I don't necessarily agree with all of the authors political posturing, but I understand reasons behind them. Support Your Seals!

B002T9H2ME|4.0|In the not-too-distant future, Lunar Industries is surface mining the Moon for Helium 3 which is used to generate clean fusion energy on Earth. It's a very significant operation that provides around 70% of the Earth's total energy requirements. Nonetheless, a solitary human is deemed sufficient to serve as a custodian on the Moon base. His name is Sam and he's nearing the end of his three-year contract. The long and rather dull Moon duty has apparently begun to warp his noggin. Fortunately, he has the aid of Gerty, a HAL 9000 type talking computer with a robot arm and a simple emoticon display. So far, so good. However, things are not quite as they seem. Lunar Industries has gotten a bit too clever with its employees. A cover up is involved which is exposed later in the movie. There is a bit of violence, but no light sabers, weirding modules, phasers, pulse rifles, ion cannons, or even a good old fashion revolver. Nothing more lethal than an Exacto knife that is mostly used for whittling. There are no aliens or exotic animals in this movie. For Sci Fi fans, Moon contains various elements from classics such as 2001 Space Odyssey, Aliens, Dune, Star Wars, Solaris, and maybe Gattaca. It also has a component of One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest, with Sam being both the Chief Bromden and the Randle McMurphy characters. Except for one fight scene, Moon is generally on the softer side of science fiction, much more like Solaris than Star Wars or Aliens. In the end, Sam wants nothing more than to return to Earth and see his lovely wife and daughter again. Let's hope a Blade Runner is not there to greet him.
B0024FAR5W|5.0|This is a great show if you are bored with the same medical, legal and cop dramas.  If you liked the old movie Mask, you will love this show. This gets more into the biker lifestyle and personal lives of the characters and I have never seen Katey Sagal in anything better.  She nails the lead female role as Jemma, the \\"first lady\\" if you will, of the club and mother of the vice-president. Ron Perlman, famous from the Hellboy movies, does a great job as the president of the club.  You see a range of emotion from his character in this and I like him better in this show than I did in the Hellboy movies.  All of the characters are well represented in the show and the watcher gets to become firmiliar with others besides the front story line actors.    The show is rated PG-14, but there were a few times where I felt as though my 15 year old would be too young to either see or hear certain things.  The language is especially crude, and there is more skin than on the 3 national networks.  There is also innuendo in situational positions where nothing is happening, but why else would a girl be kneeling in front of a guy...  Things like that...    Otherwise, I really liked the show.  It has depth, emotion, intrigue and mystery all wrapped into a population of people who don't wear suits, scrubs or badges to work everyday...

6302215730|3.0|Purchased this so my husband could see it; I am always saying, \\"Oh, they are just a Walter Mitty!\\"  He had no idea what I meant.  NOW HE DOES.  If Danny would have done less of his singing in this movie, it would have been better.  I felt that got silly (even when I was a child and saw it the first time, I felt that way).  The story is a good one and the acting in the movie is good too.    The VHS tape arrived so quickly, I couldn't believe it!  Excellent condition too.

B001Q94TQA|3.0|I loved this film when I first saw it on DVD, particularly because of the excellent music. I was initially disappointed by the stereo only soundtrack of the DVD, so when I heard of a Blu-ray release with DTS-MA audio, I was really looking forward to a high quality, full surround presentation. I received the Blu-ray, put it in the PS3, AND..... was again disappointed by 2 channel audio! The back of the disc is marked \\"Dolby Digital 5.1\\", \\"DTS Surround\\", and \\"DTS-HD Master Audio\\", but don't believe it. There are 3 audio tracks on the disc, 2 of which are director/cast commentaries, and all 3 audio tracks are DTS-MA 2 channel audio. Also, as indicated by the other reviews, I was unable to access any of the featurettes. On the plus side, the video quality is a big improvement over DVD.
0393072231|1.0|I was so looking to read this book.  Not having the book come out on Kindle by one of the first advocates of Kindle is a real bummer.  Since I first bought Kindle 2 years ago I have not read one book not on Kindle.  I'm not about to start now.
0393072231|5.0|This is an amazing book. The format makes no difference--the words are the same. I highly recommend it. If you can't afford the hard cover price, check it out of your local library.
B002VPE1AW|5.0|My husband and I saw this film twice in the theaters - something we've never done before.  The price of going to the theater is so much higher than just renting it that even when we have really liked a show in the past we've gone at most one time to the theater and then possibly rented it after it came out on video.  With Avatar, however, we LOVED the show so much that it was well worth the money to see it twice in 3-D.  We had heard the plot wasn't very strong but when we saw it we didn't feel that way at all.  It was engaging, fun and touching.  If anything, we just didn't want to see the movie end - we wanted it to keep going.  My husband loves sci-fi and I don't but we both loved it equally.  Highly recommended you at least see it once - it's a great show!
B002ZTQVBQ|4.0|Ponyo is one of those films that needs to be viewed multiple times to get the full effect (just like many of Miyazaki's works).  When I first saw this in theaters my initial reaction was \\"well, that was okay\\", but now that I have the dvd and I've had the chance to watch it a few more times (and notice some of the more subtle details), I must say that it's growing on me.      The plot basically involves a \\"goldfish\\" who leaves her home under the sea and is found by a five-year-old human boy named Souske.  He names her Ponyo, and they develop a friendship.  However, her father, Fujimoto, is a powerful wizard who attempts to get her back.  She later uses her magic to become a human girl, but her powers throw nature out of balance, causing a large storm.  Eventually, her father and her mother (a sea goddess) devise a test for Souske.  He passes and Ponyo is allowed to stay with him as a human.  And that is basically the plot in a nutshell.    Like many other Miyazaki films, Ponyo is character-driven rather than plot-driven.  The plot itself is pretty simple, and the ending seems too easy compared to other hardships faced by characters in other Miyazaki films, but there is deep and rich characterization present.  I especially found the relationship of Souske's mother and father to be interesting, as well as the characterization of the grumpy old woman, Toki.  I find it interesting that she's the most cynical, and is also the only one to notice or care about the strange qualities of Ponyo.  Fujimoto is the closest thing to an antagonist that this film has, but like all of Miyazaki's antagonists, he is not one-dimensional.  Yes, he is a bitter, human-hating individual who is too controlling, but at the same time, he has some good qualities to him--he genuinely seems to love his daughter and care about her.  He even says at the end of the movie, as a sort of apology, \\"try to remember me kindly, if you will\\".  At first I though this film was rather heavy-handed in it's environmentalist message, but then I realized that the only character in this movie who pushes the message is Fujimoto, and he is clearly bitter.  The sea goddess (the one who should rightly be most angry) doesn't seem that bitter or angry at all.  In fact, she seems to always keep a sense of good humor about her.  This is especially evident when Fujimoto is getting all stressed out on the boat and she just tells him to stop worrying so much.  In an act of good faith, she even restores some vitality to the seniors at the end of the movie.  In the end, everyone ends up happy and in good spirits.  Overall, I like how many characters are left morally ambiguous.  This is a hallmark of many Miyazaki films, and I love it because it really makes you think.    I also like how Mizaki plays with some of our sensibilities by turning them upside down.  For example, he kind of plays with the mind of the viewer by swapping the parent-child dynamic between Souske and his mother, Lisa.  He often seems to be the responsible mature one and she often comes across as immature (but still fun and loving).  This is especially evident in how she drives like a maniac, leaves him alone during a storm, and in how she throws a tantrum when her husband has to work overtime and can't come home for dinner.  Souske's maturity is especially apparent during this latter scene when he has to tell his mother, \\"I know dad doesn't always keep his promises, but he loves us and does his best for us\\".  I also like how fantasy and reality are deftly blended together; as evidenced by how many of the adults seem not to notice or care about the fantastical elements (ex.-Toki sees Ponyo's \\"human face\\" and the other seniors aren't alarmed by it, Souske's mom rather quickly accepts the idea that the human Ponyo used to be a fish, etc.).  None of this is ever explained, and it's all meant to be taken in and accepted in a surreal sort of way.  Aside from all the interesting themes, characters, and whatnot, this is a genuinely funny and cute film.  There are many funny moments interspersed to keep things light-hearted.    Lastly, this film is graphically and musically beautiful.  As everyone is aware by now, Ponyo is entirely hand-drawn, and while this may be a dying art, at least Ponyo is proof that it's going out with a bang!  I especially love the imagery of the \\"living\\" shapeshifting waves.  The music is also quite lovely; the opera singing during the introduction is rather beautiful, and Ponyo's theme song during the credits is funny and cute.  Disney has added a remixed version of the theme song in the later credits that I don't really care for, but you don't really have to listen to it anyway since it's in the end credits, so I guess it doesn't really matter.      The last thing to discuss is the technical specifications of the release.  First off , I bought the blu-ray/dvd combo pack.  The thing you should know about this is that the special features are all located on the blu-ray, so if you only have a dvd player then you might want to get the 2-disc dvd set instead.  The combo pack, however, would make a good set for someone who's transitioning from dvd to blu-ray.  As for the special features themselves, they are pretty good.  Of note are some interviews with Miyazaki about his inspiration behind Ponyo, a section detailing the locations that inspired the setting of Ponyo, interviews with the voice cast, and a segment on composing music for this and other Miyazaki films.  In the past, Miyazaki films often had very little in the way of special features, so the Ponyo release is definitely worth getting if you enjoyed the movie.  So, there's my two cents.  If you haven't yet seen the movie, rent it first and see if you like it.  Enjoy!
B002I9Z89Y|4.0|You get more Billy Blackburn vintage footage which is cool but the second season can't beat the first; I think Chekov may have ruined it with his U.S.S.R. Beatles costume.

1401323820|2.0|Writing just \\"okay\\". Bought it out of curiosity, hoping to guess who the real \\"author\\" was.  Scuttlebutt was that it was Patterson. No way!  The writing is too weak. Definitely not him.  I wouldn't guess that any substantial mystery author gave his or her time to this copy. Probably written by a contract script writer between \\"takes\\" on the set.  Interesting but glad I bought it used, not new.  Would have liked to actually get a book in good condition with a jacket, but hey, used is used.  Can't complain. Glad I didn't spend more than a buck or two on it though.
B001KVZ6FW|5.0|Wonderful movie.  Should be mandatory viewing for a full session of congress.  We need to have a vision, love, compassion, even compromise if we are to enjoy life and living.  This beautiful movie brings all that to the fore in a fantastic animation.  Stop the despair and bickering, reach outside yourself, as the old man, the boy, and the dog do in this movie, and your lives are enriched.

0061765236|4.0|\\"The Pact\\" revolves around two families: the Hartes and the Golds. They have lived by each other for seventeen years and their children, Emily and Chris, have literally known each other since they were born. Both families live fairly normal, suburban lives until one night they both get a phone call at 3am saying that their child has been brought to the hospital after a shooting incident. When they arrive, they find that Chris Harte is doing alright, but Emily has been shot in the head.    Immediately they assume it was a drive-by, but their whole world is shaken when Chris confesses that Emily was shot because of a suicide pact made between the two. As Chris is charged with Emily's murder, the two families are ripped apart, although both are grieving the loss of not only Emily, but also their friendship. Marriages and families are tested as Chris waits for nine long months in jail before his trial.    As with most of Picoult's work, \\"The Pact\\" follows a basic formula: some sort of relationship (family, love, etc) is tested by a tragedy and then there is a subsequent legal battle. I know, it would seem that an author whose style can be broken down so simply would write terrible books, but that is definitely not the case. Besides this structure, Picoult's books are all unique and equally entertaining and engaging. The legal side of the stories is a big part of why I enjoy them, so it's also nice to know that this portion of the book is always consistent.    \\"The Pact\\" gets me emotionally. It's another one of those \\"It's not real\\" kind of books. I constantly have to assure myself that this story is not actually happening. You get very attached to Chris and his family, but also feel for the Golds as they grieve their daughter and come to realize that they didn't really know her at all. Just like \\"My Sister's Keeper,\\" \\"The Pact\\" is controversial. And whether you like it or not, you form an opinion and start rooting for either the defense or the prosecution. You are so engaged in the story that it's hard not to think about it when you're not reading the book.    If you're looking for a nice, quick read with loads of substance, then \\"The Pact\\" is a good choice. (Perfect for that long plane ride to Spring Break paradise!) Filled with teary-eyed moments, it will definitely pull you in and get you thinking.
B00328G4V6|2.0|This would never have seen the light of day if JIMI was still alive. I find it sickening that the lowlifes that own the rights to this material are greedy enough to release this horrid stuff from the vaults. At best it sounds like a mediocre demo or a loose jam session. The guitar work is average at best ( not something I ever thought I'd say about JIMI ). I saw him live in HAMBURG GERMANY in about 68 and he was ( and might still be ) the best ever. If this is your first exposure to HENDRIX, you might well ask what all the fuss is about. This is an insult to the HENDRIX legacy and should never have been released. The alternate versions of earlier material are dreadful and some of the drum sound wouldn't be acceptable from a talentless garage band. Forget when it was recorded as it does not make it sound any better. ARE YOU EXPERIENCED and AXIS BOLD AS LOVE show what was possible in the late 60's and are stupendous achievements for the ultimate innovator. This garbage craps on JIMI from a great hight and the individuals responsible should be very ashamed of themselves. I also don't think that ANY JIMI is good JIMI because he is dead. Why not listen to the 4 official releases and marvel at the man's genius and ignore all these cynical posthumous releases designed to make some worthless cretins rich.
0312370849|5.0|I'll admit it: this week I fell prey to the \\"Recommended\\" table at my local book store. Being a bookseller, I find myself to be a bit of a book snob and will rarely listen to advice about my reading material. However, I am also a sucker for a nice cover (yeah, I judge a book by its cover) and \\"Sarah's Key\\" indeed has a nice cover. So I picked it up, read a few pages and before I could resist, I was hooked.    \\"Sarah's Key\\" is a historical fiction novel that flip flops between two story lines: Sarah's and Julia's. Julia Jarmond is living in modern-day Paris. She is married to a man that she describes as a typical Parisian: good-looking, successful, but also very reserved and often, cold. They live with their daughter, Zoe, and also many secrets.    Then there is Sarah, a 10-year-old French Jew who is taken from her home and sent to a concentration camp during the 1942 Velodrome D'Hiver roundup in Paris. For those of you who have no idea what the Vel D'Hiv roundup is (don't be embarassed - I didn't either!), here is a crash course: Basically 13, 000 Jewish men, women and children were arrested and taken to the Veldrome D'Hiver (a stadium), right in the middle of Paris, where they were left for several days before going to the Drancy and Beaune-la-Rolande internment camps and finally Auschwitz. Now, even if none of the other words in that sentence meant anything to you, I know you recognized Auschwitz. And so you know the fate of these poor, innocent people. Sarah is taken, along with her mother and father.    Julia also happens to be a reporter for a French tourist magazine and is assigned to cover the 60th anniversary of the Vel D'Hiv tragedy. As she begins to dig into the terrible stain on French history, she stumbles upon a 60-year-old mystery that her husband's family is working very hard to keep hidden. And once she stumbles upon it, she knows she has to get to the bottom of it, all while trying to save her crumbling marriage.    I like historical fiction. I started out as a history major in university and cried when I landed in Europe for the first time because of all the historical landmarks I was going to visit. So naturally, this is my kind of story. I had never heard of the Vel D'Hiv roundup, even though I consider myself to be someone who is very concerned about and affected by the Holocaust (I had a near breakdown in the Anne Frank house in Amsterdam) and I almost feel guilty about my ignorance now. However, I am happy that \\"Sarah's Key\\" enlightened me and entertained me at the same time.    Both story lines are wonderful and like I said, simply hook you. I demolished this book in approximately 4 hours and haven't been able to stop thinking about it since. People of all ages are able to connect with the characters and story, since at one point or another de Rosnay seems to elaborate and muse about every age. Because the story is based on a true event, it affected me even more. I often stopped and thought that the story I was reading could be a real-life account, sometimes having to remind myself that, \\"It's not real, Alex\\". That is how deep this one hits.    I recommend \\"Sarah's Key\\" to everyone. Not only because it tells a great story and entertains, but because we owe it to the victims of the Holocaust to keep their memories alive and relevant.  The only way to keep history from repeating itself is to learn from our past, our mistakes, and \\"Sarah's Key\\" helps us to remember and be thankful.
0439023483|5.0|Many other people have covered the bases here, but I just wanted to add in my ratings on this book more than anything.  At this point I will say that I am curious about the rest of the world at this point, not that this in any way hinders the story.  It just seems that this is mostly North America in the future and I wonder about the world a bit.  All the same, an amazing read and one I will be happy to take off the shelf and disappear into again!
0375836675|5.0|I've had my eye on both of Markus Zusak's books (Messenger and \\"The Book Thief\\") for a while now, as they are super popular teen books. Now that I've got a ton of free time on my hands, I finally picked up \\"I Am The Messenger.\\" The book is the story of Ed Kennedy, a 19 year old cab driver who is basically going nowhere. His life revolves around his dog, the doorman and his 3 friends, Audrey, Marv and Ritchie. One day, Ed finds himself stopping a bank robbery and shortly after he starts to receive strange messages. His first message arrives on an ace of diamonds (yes, like from a deck of cards) with 3 addresses and times. Ed visits these locations and soon realizes that he must assist the occupants in some way, whether it being simply keeping them company or saving them from abuse (I won't give away too much!). Once he completes those three tasks, another card arrives for him, sending him on another adventure. Then another. With every card, the tasks gets more difficult and Ed must decipher the message to determine his three targets. Along the way, Ed realizes lots of important lessons and eventually becomes more than a dead-end cab driver - he becomes a message.    I found this book totally engrossing, gripping me from the beginning. I literally could not put it down at one point, which is a rare event for me. Zusak is a fantastic writer and developed all the characters perfectly. His imagination also impressed me; I don't know if I could ever come up with such an inventive and clever story. And, corny as it may be, I learned a lot. It's great when a book can make you take a step back and evaluate what is important to you and \\"I Am The Messenger\\" did just that. As Ed realizes that his life can be so much more, I counted the blessings in my own life, from having a loving family to the opportunity to get an education.    \\"I Am The Messenger\\" is a great book for the New Year. What better way to kick off a new year than by taking note of all your good fortune and making some resolutions to make your life that much better? This is a feel-good book that delivers its message with a punch.
0061914177|5.0|With a title like Crush It! Why Now is the Time to Cash in on Your Passion and my previous experience with Gary Vaynerchuk's insightful but very colorful presentations, I was more than a little nervous when I started reading this book. I had nothing to fear. Unlike Hugh MacLeod (Ignore Everybody), Vaynerchuk is a perfect gentleman in print.   Interestingly, while MacLeod advocates for always retaining a \\"real\\" job and treating your passion as a hobby you generate some income from, Vaynerchuk strongly advocates for pursuing your passion with hussle and making an average to great income from doing and talking about what you love.   From Vaynerchuk's view, you'll never need a vacation if you're doing what you love. This is a message I initially believed was in contrast to the lifestyle Tim Ferriss advocates in The 4-Hour Work Week. They aren't though. Ferriss wants us to find a business model that doesn't take much of our time so that we can pursue our passions., while Veynerchuk wants us to make our living with our passions. Both achieve the same goal: income and time devoted to doing what we love.   Crush It! is filled with a healthy balance of both inspirational and practical advice. It's also the type of advice I really appreciate. Veynerchuk doesn't tell us exactly what to do. Instead he shares an outline of advice with enough examples for each of us to imagine how we could apply his methods to our individual circumstances. This type of advice seems easy to give when you're reading it, but I know from experience that it takes more thought and effort than any set of specific directions.   Which brings me to the greatest value in Crush It! It's plain that Veynerchuk not only cares about his audiences and wishes each of us success - he believes each of us is capable of succeeding. That's a powerful read for anyone.
B000WCBPOG|4.0|I love the music!!  It does have a weird sound though.  It's a little scratchy, kind of like listening to a record.  I don't know if this was a purposeful style decision or a defect with the album.  It makes it difficult to listen to loud.
0316096199|5.0|I ordered this book after reading The Lovely Bones. It started out a little graphic with the details of the rape she went through. But the rest of the story relates what the court system did to her and the reaction of those around her. It was extremely well written and kept me wanting to return to reading it as soon as I could. Anger is what I felt while fighting the battle right along with her. I admire her fortitude to keep going and fight for the right justice. I am very glad I read it and have shared it with many others.

B002ZG97RE|5.0|When the credits rolled this afternoon, a gentlemen sitting behind me had to take a deep breath. \\"Man, I'm just worn out from watching the movie.\\" I agreed with him.    This movie has all the excitement of the Jason Bourne series: hot action scenes, great sound editing, a tight script, a stellar soundtrack and excellent acting by everyone in the film, and I mean everyone!    But I couldn't handle all the camera shakes. In fact, half the movie is like this. I understand Hollywood is lately using hand-carried, un-dollyed camera techniques to create the sense of chaos and panic in a film, but this was just too much. It was like being on a roller coaster ride with the scene moving violently and not you. I regretted eating that pack of Skittles just before the film started. When I got home, I simply had to lie down for an hour.    It's a shame because the story is brilliant, and I love Matt Damon's strong acting style. If you're a fan of the Jason Bourne films, this is right up your alley, but you might want to bring a vomit bag with you. Then again...maybe not.     I was puzzled why Green Zone didn't do so well at the Box Office on its opening weekend; now, I understand why. It's not the film...it's the filming.     Wonderful, wonderful story, but it's just nauseating to watch...literally. Too bad.    I'm glad the movie wasn't in 3D. I wouldn't be able to handle it.
0316044938|3.0|I'll be the first one to admit it: this book is CREEPY. I read it in about three days, learning after the first night that this wasn't exactly the best bedtime story. The beginning is so haunting that I had some pretty vivid nightmares.<br /><br />The book starts out with a ton of promise; however(as many other reviewers have pointed out), ends on a completely disappointing and somewhat ludicrous note. What a waste of potential! I was totally thrown by the random act of sex that occurred after Susie overtakes her friend's body; I was under the impression from Susie's narration up to that point that finding and exposing her killer was at the forefront of her priorities, especially when given the opportunity to possess a living being. Things didn't exactly turn out that way, and I'm still not even sure why the story went the way it did (then again, I'm not the author). That scene, for me, was the beginning of the end; I didn't like much of anything about the book afterwards. I felt like the author gave up on the book and asked someone else to finish writing it.<br /><br />That being said, I have to say that I was engaged from the very beginning of this story. I enjoyed the book, even though I didn't totally love the story. It's middle of the road - if you think you might like it, try it on for size. Just don't be surprised if you also end up disappointed.
B001PJRAUS|5.0|This short series from British television is so entertaining. Jemima Rooper does a great job as a modern woman caught between her mundane, stressful life in London with a noncommittal boyfriend, and her escape into the romantic elegance of \\"Pride and Prejudice.\\" She gets the chance to incredibly enter the life of the Bennett household, exchanging places with Lizzy Bennett, with confusing, amusing, and at times messy consequences. The concept is similar to a novel of a few years ago, \\"The Eyre Affair\\" and a few other time- travel romances, but even without similar concept comparisons if you love Jane Austen on the screen and on the page, you'll love this show.
0061922315|5.0|The Secret Daughter is one of the best pieces of fiction I've read in some time. It is a heartwarming story about inter-cultural adoption that vividly portrays the characters and their deepest insecurities, making them feel so \\"real\\" to the reader. I enjoyed it on many levels -- for its accurate and vivid portrayal of both the rich and poor India and its wonderful story line which skillfully crafts the dichotomous lives of Asha's two families. While the central story line is captivating enough, the novel artfully delves into a number of peripheral issues Asha's two sets of parents are faced with (i.e. adoption, infertility, inter-racial marriages, role of women, cultural norms), giving the reader a three-dimensional view of all the characters in the book. The ending, which is completely unexpected, provides satisfying closure to the book.     The novel is beautifully written, thoroughly engrossing and so thought-provoking that you'll find yourself thinking about the characters for some time. I highly recommend Secret Daughter.
1400052173|5.0|This was one of the best books that I have read in quite a while.  The author gave us a very personal story of how science, which is sometimes callous and uncaring for the good of mankind, can affect families forever.  I wonder if the doctor who first sliced off some of Mrs. Lacks' cells realized the impact it would have on her family or did he even care. This was a flesh and blood mother and wife who suffered from such a aggressive form of cancer. This is a book that should be read by everyone and the question remains - after tissues are removed, who do they really below to?  Thank you Ms. Skloot for opening up our eyes to a very important issue today. This is journalism at its best.
031606792X|1.0|This book was a disaster.  I started reading the twilight series out of curiosity.  I got hooked with the first book, loved the second book, tolerated the third book and hated the forth book, Breaking Dawn.  OMG. Granted Stephanie Meyer writes for a young audience, so the books were entertaing and kept me wanting more, but but the time I finished the forth book, I was very disappointed.       This book was a complete mess.  It seems like the author had no clue how to end this series and just wrote a bunch of nonsence. This book did not end how I wanted it to (my opinion, big deal) or how it could have ended if the author could keep it together.  It was all over the place and the story line was disjointed, over the top, and ridiculous.  I can't imagine how they will turn this book into a movie.      I also don't like the fact that this series is geared toward teen girls because the message it conveys is horrific.  Basically it spews insecurity and shallowness and that all that matters is being beautiful and having a man and it was okay to die for it.  Ridiculous.  Bella came from a good family, they made her seem like such an insecure ditz.  Not the message I would want a teenager to get.
0307588335|1.0|I purchased this book with positive enthusiasm, since it was touted as being authored by an insider with specific knowledge. I had a lot of dealings with Lehman, and still hold some of their senior debt.    Instead, what I read was a statement of the obvious.  The reasons for Lehman's collapse, as highlighted in this book, are not only widely known, but extremely intuitive. The author had no sort of inside knowledge or insight. Thanks Captain Obvious.    As I struggled through the book, I realized that the author was a junior trader in distressed debt. You have to be kidding me? That explains the poor and often inaccurate descriptions of various types of collateralized bonds.    Now that some real inside information is starting to come to light (Repo 105, Mathew Lee), one can confirm that there are far more, substantial facts on the Lehman failure.    If you know little about the workings of the debt market, you can be sold this story as believable and insightful. That is too bad. By looking at the many 5-star ratings this book has received, a lot of people are being misinformed. My advice to those that fall into this category is sit-tight, and wait for a better explanation to be authored. It'll come soon enough.    If you have experience in capital markets, in particular MBS, you will be very frustrated. If you crack the cover, remember these words, \\"I warned you.\\"    It is undeniable that McDonald is great saleman. The proof is sitting in my circular file.    I completed the book, offering the author an opportunity for redemption.  It was painful, and he disappointed.

B000JMKQX0|5.0|If you enjoy zombie stories, this book is a must! It is excellently written in the style of a documentary. At first, I thought the documentary-style would be dull, but I found Brooks's writing to be so superb that I was actually quite sad when I finished the book! (Sad because there wasn't any more to read!)    I do hope that he decides to write another novel. I would purchase it even without sampling it first!
006176759X|5.0|I have never watched The Hills so I cannot relate the characters in this novel to the actual author or characters in The Hills.  I saw Lauren Conrad on a television talk show and I was much impressed with her interview and how she has moved forward from the television spotlight to fashion designer and now author.  I saw the many/positive reviews on her first book so I purchased.    The storyline was entertaining, kept my interest and I got sucked into the book that I could not put it down (very easy/enjoyable reading).  You fall in love with Jane, her innocence, Scarlett and her direct/to the point personality, Gaby clueless and Madison the controlling vixen.  Great poolside reading; finished the book over the weekend and couldn't wait to read the continuation of the story, Sweet Little Lies.    Highly recommended.
0385504225|5.0|Here is a review of a key themeof Dan Brown's bestselling novel, \\"The Lost Symbol\\".     Around Chapter 82 Reverend Dean Galloway - dean of the cathedral enters the story and we are told, \\"looked like he had been alive forever.\\"   We then go through a, \\"discreetly hidden door that lead into an administrative annex.\\"  Interesting.  Then out of the blue in big print in brass nameplate, it's announced his title, \\"The Reverend Dr. Colin Galloway Cathedral Dean.\\"  We know here is a very important person.  Then we find Mr Langdon, a doubter, of the Ancient Mysteries, \\"you do not believe in such things.\\"  Wow, a symbiologist, without answers.   We then find, \\"The Secret hides within the Order\\" and the words order are capitalised, so we know we are dealing with the very Special, Highest of All.     We are then asked the question, \\"know ye not that ye are gods\\" and \\"Man created in God's image\\" introduces new themes...Psalms 82:6 \\"Ye are gods!\\"   We are then forewarned of the great pending change, \\"The religion of the future, Einstein had predicted, will be a cosmic religion.  It will transcend personal God avoid dogma and theology.\\"   This is astounding, one could say clairvoyant statements, which are likely to be true. The seal was broken, by Ms. Solomon, setting in motion a series of events from which there is no return.   Katherine stared dumbfounded at the reverend, as he was referring to the Seven Seals of Revelation.  The reverend tells Langdon, \\"You do not have eyes to see.\\"   Will Langdon understand there are Seven Messages, Seven Seals, Seven Trumpets and Seven Plagues of Revelation?    Next we move to Chapter 84....something is pending...\\"I never imagined I would live to witness this moment\\"...\\"The Mysteries are moving out of the inner circles...out of darkness...into the light.\\"  The pew warmers are wondering what's going on.   Peter Solomon senses the danger of this time, \\"He sensed something was watching him...waiting...intending to do him great harm.\\"   There isno easy road to travel.   Change never just happens.  But a, \\"catalyst...has the power to transform this world\\" awakens us to something is going to happen....and the, \\"new development occurs incredibly fast.\\"   This is real telepathy working globally, the noetic world.    We await the, \\"transformative moment of enlightenment\\"...at-one-ment of mind and soul.       Chapter 85 is Transformation.....with Langdon stating, \\"I had no idea\\" as two symbols fused to create one.   Man and God are one.    The devil in Chapter 86 states, \\"In order to create, I must destroy.\\"   Will good triumph over evil...does good eventually triumph?    The establishment in Chapter 86 is shaken, \\"Dean Galloway felt a lightness in his step that he had not felt in years\\"...\\"He had spent his life straining to be heard above the din of ignorance\\"...\\"They defended their worldly desires by citing Scripture they did not understand\\"...\\"filled with the false life of the theological vine.\\"   Dan Brown states, \\"It is always darkness before the dawn.\\"   How can these statements be made, \\"we have the truth\\", haughty, confident, I stand unchallenged.  Chapter 88 warns, \\"Time is running out.\\"  Know thyself is the word.  There is no intercessor.   Each must stand alone.  Chapter 89, we are told \\"The pyramid is a real map, Galloway had told them, and it points to a real location.\\"   This is recognition of the divinity of each person, life is real, each moment is to be revered.   Each story is real.  There is no aborting life as respect becomes integrity.  We are all with God without religion.  Without wax our words are true....there will none that \\"preferred their own feeble gestures of personal sacrifice...fasting, Lenten renunciation, tithing.\\"   It is recognised sacrifice is daily, in all actions, sabbath continually one might say    In Chapter 98 Robert finds his birth outfit, \\"Where the hell are my clothes?\\"...\\"I'm in a box!\\" is a fitting methaphor.  \\"I have been buried alive\\"...\\"I am going to suffocatealone in this box.\\"    Skipping along to Chapter 107, the question starst flowing, \\"Does heaven exist?  What happens when I die?\\"...and then, \\"pure consciousness\\" is recognised, now.    Chapter 108, wow, a short Chapter...\\"the physical world had ceased to exist.\\"      Chapter 110 the \\"bell began tolling\\" and by Chapter 111 we are at, \\"wonderful new age of enlightenment.\\"   No one knows quiet what is going to be the spark, but we are learning, \\"I create as I speak.\\"  Then the pathway opens, \\"Your passion is an important catalyst in the coming change.\\"  \\"Study the Bible\\"...especially the final pages as the 7Angel Messages, 7 Seals, 7 Trumpets and 7 Plagues are going to be known, I suppose...\\"a reveal-ation.  The Book of Reveal-ation in the Bible predicts an unveiling of great truth and unimaginable wisdom.\\"   The students give Peter Solomon applause.     Scenes of action follow.   No sleeping here.    By Chapter 126 we are told, \\"You have walked past it and never seen it.\\"  No one is going to tell you, you must find out for yourself.  No one can do it for you.    Read and reread chapters 130-133....\\"Concealed within those pages there hides a wonderful secret\\"...talking of the Old and New Testaments...\\"the Word has been the Bible\\"...\\"which awaits in darkness at the foot of the staircase\\"...scythe...hourglass...\\"index finger was extended, pointing directly at a large open Bible as if to say, \\"The answer is in there!\\"...\\"a vast collection of untapped wisdom waiting to be unveiled.\\"  Twitter, Google, Wikipedia...the noetic world...\\"Out of many, one.\\"  Pure consciousness...hope.    Well worth a read.

B001PJRAUS|3.0|I was way excited to be able to find this on DVD as all other forms of viewing were difficult at best.  I do wish that the show went into more depth but I like the show and therefore remained amused.      If you love Jane Austen spin offs then this is a fun one!
B0000047GA|5.0|To me, this record is has a lot of great examples of the best \\"fusion\\" ever released. It's loud, organic, creative, powerful, and not afraid to take chances. The music itself is a kind of blend of post bop, funk, and loud electric rock, with some elements of free jazz. The noisy stew whipped up by Williams, McLaughlin and Young is so full of shifting dynamics and bright color it's almost psychedelic. Personally I think this record was a plateau in Tony's playing; he's so forceful, propulsive and melodic that it's obvious he's the leader of the group even if you didn't know it was his name on the cover. McLaughlin's pre-Mahavishnu tone and playing are on great display here; raunchy bends, twisting bop lines, some weird wah tones, all to great effect. Young is the band's secret weapon, controlling the harmonic weather from behind the scenes, providing rhythm figures and getting in some effective (but sparse) soloing lines. Having said all this, there are parts of this record that are dated and weak (most notably Tony's singing), but there's thankfully not a lot of it. The meat of this record is the instrumental passages, and their power and sheer uniqueness make up for any shortcomings. This is fusion from the time before the \\"rules\\" for fusion were laid and it became a stale cliche.
1416585710|4.0|First, the disclaimer: I am a diehard King Fan. I checked out the audio version from my local library and am having fun listening to the book. While some of the language, as mentioned by others, is silly, many of the expressions are wonderful. I love the \\"Strap it on\\" references; vaguely sexual and vaguely cowboy like. I have made this adage one of my own for tough times. As a lapsed Catholic, I especially like the \\"Jesus, Mary and Jo-Jo the carpenter\\". I actually blurted this out in a corporate meeting last week and got lots of laughs, even from the Southern Baptists.<br /><br />In this book, King takes on what he does best. He gives voice to what goes on in our heads. It's the internal dialogue that we all have at times, put to paper or in my case, put to audio. I have always been disappointed with the movies made from King's books, mainly because there is no real way to capture, on film, what is going on internally. I loved The Stand as a book and yet hated it as a movie. Many years ago I read King's novels just for the horror stories.  Now I am rereading these novels and thinking more about the internal dialogues.
B001JT99VC|5.0|Great book! The first couple of chapters were a bit disturbing, but I could not put the book down... I enjoyed it so much that I also ordered her other book Lucky.
1592402690|4.0|This time, it comes from a pen of someone working with them. Working like a damned crack monkey trying to mix & lay on tape sounds to match what the Fabs heard in their heads. Not an easy task!<br /><br />He doesn't seem to like George Harrison much, can't decide if Ringo is cool or useless, wonders about John Lennon's wild mood swings ... and gushes 'bout Paul like a schoolgirl with a crush!!<br />There are also some poison needle remarks thrown about George Martin & other EMI staffers. This is fine once or twice, but halfway thru the book starts to get rather tiresome (Although it helps if you pretend a 20-year-old was writing this, not an elderly man looking back on his early days)<br /><br />BUT, there are some fascinating bits about what went on during recording sessions. The neverending search for new sounds & audio tricks, the crazy parties, the tension building, the madness of Apple Corp. The drama trainwreck of \\"White Album\\" sessions... There are even a few Yoko episodes (including the bed installation and how she made Harrison nuts by eating his food)<br /><br />The book isn't all Beatles tho. There is also a chapter of trying to build a recording studio in the basement of Apple Corp, and later recordings with Paul & Linda. The story comes full circle with Anthology and those 2 very special brand new singles that came to be<br /><br />Definitely give it a read<br />Plus anyone taking an extra few pages to bash the great con artist known as \\"Magic Alex\\" deserves at least a few minutes of your attention
B002GHHJU4|4.0|I had seen the movie and thought that I would like quite a few of the songs off of the soundtrack so I purchased it for my friend, as he really liked the music more than I.  After he listened to it, I was going to borrow it and see if I wanted to buy it.  The funny part is that when I bought it, it was close to my birthday and he bought me this CD for my birthday the same day I ordered it for him.

031606792X|5.0|Wow!  I read the other reviews and just had to post my own.  I guess it never entered my mind that people would not just be awestruck when they read the final book.  I was late to the Twilight party having only read all four books, back-to-back last year.  The final book is by far the bravest book I've ever read.  I was absolutely positive that Stephanie would not tackle Bella becoming a vampire.  I was certain she would fade out at the end of the book with Edward turning Bella.  I surprised by and fascinated with the book from page one until the end.    It is really hard to explain why the last book was so satisfying.  It's about family, all-consuming love, the bonds of friendship, unfounded animosity and triumph over injustice.    Bella, who has never been comfortable as a human and never felt she deserved the love of the Cullen family, finds her place, where she was always meant to be.  Through her love and loyalty to family, to Edward, to Jacob, the Cullens, and her friends she earns the right to get what she wants most out of life and what she was not even aware she wanted.    Edward, who has loved Bella and waited a century for her, has struggled with Bella's choice to become a vampire.  He wants to be with her forever but does not want to damn her soul.  It seemed right that by turning her, it was her salvation instead of damnation.  By the end of the final book your heart is just bursting with happiness that he gets to live on as a husband and father with the family that he loves beyond words.    Jacob, who has been so loyal, finally receives his own reward.  He finds his place as a wolf and learns that life is always hard when you create conflict where there is none.  He is so good hearted that he wants what's best for Bella even though it tears him apart.  So in the end after he has braved all the heartache it was only fitting that he end up with the promise of a future with someone who will complete his life, like Bella completes Edwards.    All of the characters that swirl around them serve as a reminder that you can't live your life by yourself.  You need friends and family.  They complete the chain and life can't be fully realized (or fully satisfying) without them.

B0036EBARO|5.0|my first couple of spins of this cd, i was like, ok, but after a few more i was wowed , its a great cd, i think too many people who wrote there reviews did it after hearing this cd only one or two times. Supernature was great, but this is just as good. As for Seventh tree, well, that was just a miss step, it felt flat and kind boring, this cd should have been the follow up to Supernature. Songs like Rocket, Believer, Alive, all great works of art. Shiny and warm sound like it could have been from Black Cherry, Dreaming is one of my favs, there all good, i would have loved 2 more songs, but i can hear alot of great remixes here. You got to love the abba like Head First. I am very impressed. Come on Goldfrapp fans, dont be so hard on a band that works so hard to please there fans, there should have been more 5 star reviews, For what it is, this is a great and fun piece of pop music, it will have you singing and tapping your feet. This band gives up all kinds of sound and visions. lets not be hard or mean to a bad who puts out great music. lets see more 5 star reviews for hard work and great music. HEAR IT, LOVE IT. BUY IT. Goldfrapp is pure GOLD. thanks for the great music.

I don't really know if it's the characters or the setting, but City of Bones just isn't my cup of tea and I've read a lot of YA paranormal romance books. And I'm NOT comparing this with Twilight or anything because I find that way too many people are doing that and it isn't fair to a unique story like the one in City of Bones. It was an okay read but I couldn't finish the book. 3/5 stars from me.
B001XRLWPQ|5.0|Mystery writer extraordinaire Rick Castle (Nathan Fillion) rubs elbows with many celebrities and even has the mayor of New York on speed dial. His friendship with the mayor lands him the pleasure of shadowing Detective Kate Beckett (Stana Katic), much to her dismay. When Beckett realizes a recent string of murders follow story lines in the author's books, she shows up at a book launch party to question Castle. The pair has chemistry that sizzles, though Beckett won't admit it. She has always been a fan of the author, and now that she has met him, she grudgingly sees the real man she describes as a 9 year-old on a sugar rush. Castle is a devoted father to Alexis (Molly Quinn) and a patient son to Martha Rodgers (Susan Sullivan). The family moments are very touching. This entire cast works well together. Castle is the flamboyant gadget geek with a hint of sarcasm and Beckett is the straight laced cop. Police Captain Roy Montgomery (Ruben Santiago-Hudson) is definitely in charge of his precinct, but he also knows the importance of mixing humor in the daily grind. Javier Esposito (Jon Huertas) and Kevin Ryan (Seamus Dever) are pitch perfect as detectives who work alongside Beckett. Dr. Lanie Parish (Tamala Jones) plays the ME who is also a friend of Beckett's, and sees the growing attraction between the two crime solvers. \\"Castle\\" is brilliantly entertaining from beginning to end!

B003274QH6|5.0|\\"Breaking Bad...\\" it's really hard to put into words.  When you try to tell somebody about it, they just give you a weird look and wonder how in the hell you can root for somebody who is making crystal meth.  To be honest, just saying that right now makes it hard for even me to believe it's possible, but that is the brilliance of the show.  When you see it all laid out, you understand and even sympathize with the main characters, even if you despise what they're doing.  This is one helluva show filled with drama, excitement and dark comedy.<br /><br />Walter H. White has a serious problem on his hands.  While he is an absolute genius when it comes to chemistry he is only able to make good of it by being a high school teacher and work part-time at a car wash just in order to support his family.  When he finds out that he has lung cancer and will most likely only have a few more years to live, everything changes.  He wonders how in the world he'll be able to make sure his family is in good shape by the time he's gone, and that's no easy task when there's a baby on the way.<br /><br />When he goes on a ride along with his brother-in-law (who is a DEA agent) and sees the amount of money that is made from meth labs--and also finds out that a former student of his is a dealer--he gets an idea on how he can provide for his family after all.  He will use his smarts in chemistry and break just about every respectable rule he has lived by.  At the start, he believes that this can be done without bloodshed and that deals can be legit, but it doesn't take long for him to figure out that this isn't the case after all.  Needless to say, Walt will end up making one hell of a character arc throughout these first 7 episodes as him and his former student Jesse will always be in constant danger.  There is nothing safe and pretty about the drug business, and Walt will find out how far he will have to go.<br /><br />The series is AMAZINGLY written, and again it is filled with characters you normally wouldn't sympathize with.  In that way it is kind of like \\"Dexter\\" where you know the main character is doing some terrible things, yet you are rooting for him and you get very nervous when things go wrong for him.  My brief outline of the show does it no justice at all, and I admit that.  This is something you just have to see for yourself.  Bryan Cranston is superb and deserves the Emmys he has won for this show.  His transformation throughout the show is spellbinding.<br /><br />Since this is the first season and it is a short first season, most of this is putting all of the pieces into place.  That doesn't mean that it drags or is boring.  Far from it!  Every episode is engaging and there isn't a moment where you don't feel invested in what is going on.  The Blu-Ray edition has great picture and sound quality and offers a couple of special features such as behind-the-scenes featurettes and commentary on certain episodes.<br /><br />\\"Breaking Bad\\" is proving to be one of my favorite shows, and this is only after seeing the first season.  I cannot wait to start Season 2, and from what I've heard of it, it's even more intense and on-the-edge.  While this show will not be for everyone, anyone who likes a dark and challenging series should give it a try.  Once you start that first episode, you'll find it very hard to stop.

0061703257|4.0|I've just finished Mr. Lehane's \\"Shutter Island.\\" I must say that from the very opening paragraph, this novel --- no, this deftly crafted  psychological thriller -- captured my imagination as no other book in this genre has for a very long time. To say it is a page-turner, would be a cliche. Nonetheless, once into the plot, one becomes as obsessed as the protagonist racing to find the conclusion to his quest. The story races with an increasing crescendo until it delivers what the 'New York Times' describes as a \\"visceral shock\\" in its final moments. I would recommend this reading to anyone who enjoys being grabbed by the mind. And I would strongly URGE anyone to read the novel before viewing the currenly released movie. Lehane demonstrates a rare and wonderful talent as a storyteller.

B00328G4V6|4.0|Jimi Hendrix was, is, and will always be the greatest guitarist who walked the face of the earth. And his latest posthumous album does not disappoint, as it shows some of his last recordings and some demo recordings from 1967-1970 about a few months before he dies. The arc de triumphe is the title track, \\"Valleys of Neptune,\\" with Jimi's flowing rootsy-bluesy guitar and his great vocals. He can never make a bad album. And his instrumental version of Cream's early metal hit \\"Sunshine of Your Love\\" is flawless.    R.I.P. Jimi Hendrix
0307266303|5.0|This book was given to me by an associate at work who new that I like to casually run.  To level set, I'm a casual runner 15-20 miles a week depending on work travel.  I'm a Clydesdale who just lumbers along,,,  but I do love running.      This is a great book for everyone.   It isn't so over the top about running that a person who has a passing interest or even no interest in running could enjoy the book.  It has great character development as we learn about the backgrounds of several different individuals involved in this unusual sport.  I also enjoyed the scientific aspect he brought to analyzing running's origins and our abilities as runners.  The injury information he provides gives me hope that I can continue to run for several years.
B0035G9ABQ|4.0|I've loved Gorillaz ever since \\"Clint Eastwood\\" came out. And then they released the song that played during my summer swims \\"Feel Good, Inc.\\" And now they have \\"Stylo,\\" featuring some raps from Be Kind Rewind star Mos Def and a verse from R&B singer Bobby Womack. It's not so hard for me to say that \\"Stylo\\" is the best song on this GD album. It's just groovy and I love 2D's croons on this song. \\"OH STYLOOOOOO!\\"    But that's not the only cool track I'm gonna focus on. This is the first album by an animated rock group to feature both Snoop Dogg and Lou Reed. Also, this is the first album by any group to feature Snoop Dogg and Lou Reed. Snoop Dogg has the second track \\"Welcome to the World of the Plastic Beach,\\" and Lou Reed has the ninth track, the cool-as-BLEEP \\"Some Kind of Nature.\\"    Niow, the real fire here is the track preceding \\"Stylo,\\" called \\"Rhinestone Eyes\\" and one of the only four tracks to only feature Gorillaz and no one else.    In other words, this is probably gonna shoot Gorillaz to the top. Just wait. The album's already awesome as hell.
0393072231|5.0|I haven't finished reading this yet but so far I love it.  I've never left a review on Amazon before but felt it was necessary this time because of all the people giving this book a one star rating just because it's not available on their Kindle.  Why should I care if you can read this on your Kindle?
B0030BYWKK|3.0|I don't know what to say about the \\"Van Occupanther\\" album because I never heard it. But \\"The Courage of Others\\" was uninspiring and forgettable. The only cool-sounding tracks were the first two tracks, \\"Acts of Man\\" and \\"Winter Dies.\\" The \\"Children of the Grounds\\" song was a little annoying. I absolutely hated \\"The Horn,\\" it was just stupid and was only on the album because they couldn't fit anything else on. More examples of filler are \\"Rulers, Ruling All Things,\\" \\"Core of Nature,\\" and \\"Fortune.\\"    This album was a mistake and should've been aborted.
B0036EBARO|3.0|I've long given up on Goldfrapp creating an album as unique as Felt Mountain, that being said, no matter what genre the duo decide to tackle I can always count on walk ing away with a few gems.  A very talented group overall, you can see they're having a lot fun exploring.<br /><br />Hunt - Clear winner of the album, this is the song on repeat.<br />Shiny and Warm - Another goody, not mind blowing but fun<br />Believer - Took me a bit to warm up to this one<br />Voicething - Can be a bit difficult to listen to at times but is good overall, almost like a spiritual successor to Oomparadar in a sense.
B00361HV02|3.0|\\"Beat the Devil's Tattoo\\" is not BRMC's best album, but it has its moments. Like the title track and \\"Aya,\\" they are goth metal anthems and they will not be forgotten. Unfortunately, the rest of the album will.
B0030IIYWA|5.0|Since this Disney movie came out when I was a kid I've always loved it. I was glad to hear that there was going to be a new release on blu-ray. So far this is the sixth Disney movie on blu-ray I've purchased, and they have all been wonderful. However, I did not get this one on amazon because target had it at the same price. I will add that amazon often has great deals in which you can purchase two movies at a discounted price. I can wait until I have kids so that they can enjoy this movie as much as I have.
B0034JGBM0|4.0|I've always loved the White Stripes since \\"Seven Nation Army\\" came out. It was their true alt anthem that makes no sense. And it sounds just as good now when played live, 'cuz it's the best track on the album.    The White Stripes, although not as appreciated as modern rock bands such as Nickelback and Creed, should have been the biggest band ever. They should've pushed mainstream rock bands off the radar and ruled the world. But they didn't because the public preferred fake rockers with motorcycles than the real thing.    That's fine with me, because the White Stripes rule my world.

B0035J6TAI|3.0|Strange, isn't it? That Peter Gabriel used to have so much talent and now it seems that he has lost so much of that talent that he devotes a whole album to covering artists. This is the guy who did the amazing video for \\"Sledgehammer\\" in 1980-something. Although I liked his take on Randy Newman's \\"I Think It's Going to Rain Today,\\" the rest of it was purely disappointing. He ruined the quirk of Regina Spektor's \\"Apre Moi.\\" Shame on you, \\"Sledgehammer\\" guy!
0385341008|5.0|What a delightful story. It was a pleasant surprise. I never tire of hearing a quote from Bronte or Shakespeare -- or my favorite, Jane Austen. While sad to read of a London destroyed by war --and books gone -- it still proved lighthearted and even whimsical at times. The characters come alive and one gets a sense of war's aftermath. I admit it bounces around a bit, from letter to letter, and person to person, but my interest never wavered, not once. A joy to hold and to read. What a treat.
B0029LHW68|2.0|You made us wait all this time for THIS! What's really scary about this album is that the best track on the album is a collabo with Kanye, the biggest douche in hip-hop! WTF, 30STM? I used to think 30 Seconds to Mars was a good band. \\"The Kill\\" and \\"From Yesterday\\" were totally killer emo/alt tracks. Now their new album just blows. It was underhyped, and they wasted too much time on production and they gotta be desperate for a pop hit when they make a song with Kanye West!
B00006CXSS|5.0|I got Band of Brothers for my boyfriend as a Christmas present. I had never seen it before so we watched it together. It was amazing!
0385340575|4.0|There had been some feeling the author wandered off the path last few books and quality sufferred. I felt to a large extent the old Reacher reappeared. The oft repeated descriptions of his minimalist approach to ownership, clothes for example were kept appropriately short and that was welcome by this time. I felt the plot twists were done especially well and kept the interest high making for a very good read. Great ultimate villany too. I am kind of thinking he should be getting tired of wandering around aimlessly one of these days but heck, he always seem to have an adventure that includes some great sex wherever he stops or gets hung up. If you like Reacher get ready to enjoy. I think if you are not familiar with the series you should go back and start at the beginning. There is more assumption of reader knowledge about the character and his background than is often the case and I don't believe the book would be as good as a stand alone read. Besides it was a pleasure to slowly get to know this unusual guy and his cold war army world.
0786838655|3.0|I purchased this for my son for his Sophomore Honors English class; he was required to read a \\"young adult\\" book to review and give a talk on it. He thought it was \\"lame,\\" and he had to push himself to finish it. It seemed too much like a \\"rip-off\\" of the Harry Potter books.<br /><br />I'm 54 and I agree, to a certain extent. I finished it it quickly. Riordan's writing is not as polished as some other authors I have read, but as a children's book (note I didn't say young adult) it is great. Perfect for 5th & 6th graders. I chuckled all the way through at the Harry Potter parallels, but the writing is not as engaging as Rowling's. I am, and always have been, an aficionado of Greek mythology, and I have to admit that Riordan's twists on some of the gods and characters of old were very amusing.
0385737424|3.0|Although the writing is excellent, this story just fell a little flat for me. I had the big \\"mystery\\" figured out entirely by page 68, and was very disappointed to find I was 100% right. I think Stead could have given away enough information to make you go BACK and say Ah-HA!, but not so much that it was THIS easy to figure out. Good coming of age story overall though, not exactly a gripping page turner, but the characters and themes make it worth reading.
B0018CWEYY|5.0|Some have said this is the best season? I'll still stick with the first, though this one is up there, for sure.
B0034JKZ3G|5.0|I'm glad that Disney is bringing back hand-drawn, since the Pixar deal got through. Although, The princess and the frog didn't win the Oscar it still manages to entertains my whole family and brings a lot of laughs. My whole family went to see this movie in Decemeber, and they liked it. My oldest daughter said it was just okay, however, my youngest daughter loved it more with all the merchandise she got with it. I love it more than Snow White, Sleeping Beauty, and Cinderella, because this movie has such a lovely ending!  It seems that my youngest daughter has become more interested in the movie \\"Tangled\\" (Rapunzel) coming out in November. However, Randy Newman did a great job on some of the songs, but the score didn't quite feel like a fairy tale.  In some parts of the movie it sounded very much like Toy Story... which Mr. Newman has done as well. This film, unfortunately, did not have any memorable songs. I'm glad Alan Menken is doing the music for Disney's 50th and next fairy tale film, Tangled. :) Anyways, this movie is a great family movie and highly recommended for Disney fans!
B0019LY5IM|4.0|I just wish they'd have kept the packaging the same as the original four seasons with the plastic box over the cardboard foldout packaging.

B0018QCXGY|4.0|I agree with J.J. Abrams that America deserves a monster, a giant monster, like Godzilla that sticks in the psyche of the American people for generations. Alas, Godzilla, who was the inspiration for Cloverfield has his roots in the horrors of America dropping the Atomic Bomb on 2 cities to win WWII. Godzilla, a monster born from atom bomb testing embodies something that the Japanese will always remember. The origin of the Cloverfield monster is unknown. Is it an inadvertently man-made monster? Is it a monster from the deepest part of the ocean or is it from outer space? Who knows? And while that is a burning question throughout the movie, it is never answered. There are many things that work for the movie, but after awhile they have the opposite effect. I have seen the movie 3 times, including once in the movie theater. Twice I have gotten nauseated from the handheld, bouncy camera work. I get it. Its a Youtube like look at a large scale disaster, parts of which were inspired by 9/11. But the movie goes overboard with the handheld camera movement. This last time I watched it I had to take Tylenol from a headache centered right behind my eyes. And that is my biggest complaint because the movie is well made, with a good storyline and has characters you care about. But the camera work went overboard to emulate what is seen on Youtube news reports. Will there be a sequel, one shot traditionally? I hope so. And how can there not be a sequel, if this is supposted to be America's Godzilla.  I recommend that anyone into Sci-Fi or even horror see the film, it is a scary movie. But be aware that you may experience either nausea or eye pain from the camera work. Sigh. We deserve a sequel JJ.
B002OT730K|3.0|The Rolling Stones always embraced contradictions and usually made them work, but when it comes to what \\"Love You Live\\" represents, the irony is how can a band that has been the ultimate \\"must have\\" tickets issue live albums that are not too exciting.<br /><br />\\"Love You Live\\" follows the Stones true live masterpiece, \\"Get Yer Ya-Ya's Out.\\" Gone is the raw power of the band being a self-contained unit with occasional piano from Ian Stewart. Gone is Mick Taylor whose guitar virtuosity made some of the songs so memorable. Put in its place a sense of showmanship and glitter plus some obvious stylistic concessions to funk and the glitz scene of the mid-to-late 1970's. Help driving the sound in that direction is Billy Preston playing with the band on most of the album. Some of it works. Some is a disaster. Some just sounds dated.<br /><br />Right from the beginning, the new world order appears as the openning number, \\"Honky Tonk Woman,\\" becomes a much tamer, campier number. Sounding like the Stones Las Vegas Review, the second number melds \\"If You Can't Rock Me\\" with \\"Get Off of My Cloud\\" strongly highlighting Billy Preston who swaps lines with Mick on the \\"Cloud\\" portion. The third cut is much more geniune and is Keith Richards' debut on lead vocals on a live album with a very fast-paced and rockin' version of \\"Happy.\\" It's also the first number where Ronnie Wood, his first tour with the band, starts to become noticeable. \\"Star Star\\" and \\"Hot Stuff\\" are just crappy live versions of new songs since their last live recording. Thus ends what would have been side one of the double LP set. What would be side two is pretty much all throw-away material starting with what sounds almost like a roller-rink organ led version of \\"Tumblin' Dice\\" a total mutation of the the original. The next three songs are total duds, \\"Fingerprint File,\\" \\"You Gotta Move,\\" and \\"You Can't Always Get What You Want.\\" \\"Fingerprint File\\" being perhaps their worst live performance ever.<br /><br />The real joy of the album is what would be side 3 on the original LP, the \\"El Macambo\\" side. The Stones play a small club in Toronto and are definitely up for the task playing a series of great blues and R&B classics. Keith and Ronnie seem to be finding their groove as Billy Preston's roll is reduced to a more typical Stones piano player function. They rip through \\"Mannish Boy,\\" \\"Crackin' Up,\\" \\"Little Red Rooster,\\" and \\"Around and Around.\\" \\"Crackin' Up\\" almost seems to suggest a reggae arrangement rather than attempting to follow Bo Diddley's orginal approach.<br /><br />The final four tracks are typical Stones crowd pleasers, tunes they've played in every concert for decades now. \\"It's Only Rock n Roll,\\" \\"Brown Sugar,\\" \\"Jumpin' Jack Flash,\\" and \\"Sympathy for the Devil\\" come blasting through in arena rock fashion. Instrumentally, they definitely rock but there's no sense of passion. Jagger's vocals for \\"Brown Sugar\\" and \\"Jumpin' Jack Flash\\" are downright silly in places as he slurs the lyrics almost in a self-parody fashion. One might hear, \\"Brah Show-wah\\" and \\"Jumpa Ja Fa, ya can ga-ga-ga.\\"  \\"Sympathy for the Devil\\" is absolutely dredful, not as bad in someways as later versions with the sampled percussion, but in many ways,this version is just as mechanical and sounds dreadfully noisy.<br /><br />Universal's remastering is competent and makes the album louder than the earlier Virgin remaster that was perfectly adequate. There is absolutely no reason what-so-ever to buy this recording if one already has the Virgin release. In fact, apart from the El Macambo recordings, there's really no reason to buy this album at all except for the real Rolling Stones completists. Ironically, though this album represents material recorded in the mid- 70's, on the basis of this effort came the first suggestions that the Rolling Stones were truly getting old.

B00005JPMZ|5.0|The first CGI film featuring TMNT... years after Shredder was defeated, the Turtles  live more domestic lives and Leonardo about half a world away training.  A new menace has arisen and I'll leave it at that (Amazon.com `no-spoiler' policy).  Action, comedy and drama in CGI... cool.  Great voice cast... including Patrick Stewart, Sarah Michelle Gellar and the late great Mako as the voice of Splinter.  Cool.  I place it 2nd after the first live action film. : )
0316044695|5.0|This review is being done by the wife of the recipient of this book.  I bought this for my husband for his birthday, as he had been asking for it for some time.  He read it cover to cover over 2 two hour flights, and said it was fantastic.  He is now encouraging me to read it, to have a real understanding of what these SEALS go through, to see how they are true patriots, and realize how much we owe our freedom to them, and all those who serve this great, FREE country!  Let's keep this country the land of the free and the home of the brave.
B002VECM6S|5.0|The storyline features Michael Oher, an offensive lineman who plays for the Baltimore Ravens of the NFL. This movie follows Oher from his impoverished upbringing, through his years at Wingate Christian School a fictional representation of Briarcrest Christian School in the suburbs of Memphis, Tennessee[4]), his adoption by Sean and Leigh Anne Tuohy, and on to his position as one of the most highly coveted prospects in college football. Yes, this is a sports story, yes this is a biopic, but it is also in large part an interpersonal drama. The aspects of Michael's story that make it moving and inspiring were captured with skill and integrity.  Whether you like Leigh Anne Touhy or not in the end, she is certainly entertaining and Sandra Bullock does a great job of bringing her onto the screen. And finally, what happened to Steve Hamilton, the boy whose family Michael was staying with when he started attending Briarwood? Once introduced as his father he pressures the coach into letting Steve and Michael into the school, he disappears from the movie. Minor issues that didn't keep this from being an extremely enjoyable movie.
B00005JLWN|5.0|In a futuristic world, a strict regime has eliminated war by suppressing emotions: books, art and music are strictly forbidden and feeling is a crime punishable by death. Cleric John Preston is a top ranking government agent responsible for destroying those who resist the rules. Whe he misses a dose of Prozium, a mind-altering drug that hinders emotion, Preston, who has been trained to enforce the strict laws of the new regime, suddenly becomes the only person capable of overthrowing it. \\"Equilibrium\\" is basically a progression from a fairly complex sci-fi film. The cast does an excellent job of portraying characters in this movie. \\"Equilibrium\\" is meant as entertainment. And entertain it does. It does it so very well. It mixes action and with substantial plot and original style to make an excellent movie.

B001C4AFOY|5.0|From the exceptional costuming to the beautiful cinematography, `Young Victoria' is a triumph...a gem of a film that shines thru all the surrounding noise: when I put this DVD in to watch (released earlier in the UK), I was very impressed with the quality of the entire program!  Emily Blunt is stellar as Victoria and Rupert Friend as Albert, as well as great performances from the whole supporting cast: one of my only `issues' with this film is that it was just too short: I was hoping for 3 hours & got about half that: other than that, I was so very well pleased with this film!      Content: Young Victoria had very little that was objectionable in content: there was a sensual bedroom scene (not graphic) between a husband & wife, there was a little violence (a man shoots someone), a little language, and some adult themes, but overall, this was a clean film.  I would say it is reasonably family-friendly, but that parents should view it before-hand, to decide if it is acceptable for younger children.        I really enjoyed Young Victoria: from the costumes, to the scenery, to the acting, to the locations, it was just a beautiful film all round: a neat, concise telling of Queen Victoria's ascension & early years of rule, with a huge focus on her relationship & marriage to Albert...a true delight of a film!
0143116738|4.0|This book was well written, and provided encouragement for seeking new alternatives in life.  A distraction was its reliance on popular persons for examples.  It seemed as though the author was name dropping.  Nonetheless, it was a worthwhile read.
B00328G4V6|5.0|Great CD - love new to me Hendrix.  Sound is surprisingly not compressed and brickwalled.      Walmart and Sam's Club have this CD in a jewel case, not the digipak.  I can't stand digipaks, as they wear out and look frail pretty quickly, and Sony did a nice job on the booklet for the jewel case.    BTW, the bonus tracks on the target version are on 'Here my music' on Dagger Records - another Hendrix compilation.

B002TVQ4HG|5.0|When Jess sets sail on a yacht with a group of friends, she cannot shake the feeling that there is something wrong. Her suspicions are realized when the yacht hits a storm in the Bermuda Triangle and the group is forced to board a passing ocean liner to get to safety. The ship appears deserted, but Jess is convinced she's been on board before. They soon realize they are not alone, someone is intent on hunting them down, one by one. This movie definitely get your mind all twisted after finishing it. The movie leaves you figuring out your own answers as to what it all means. There's not much as far as gore goes, but there's a decent amount of blood in a few of the scenes. Luckily the movie isn't easily predicted, and constantly forces you to analyze the events and why they're happening. A surprisingly good movie that leaves you guessing up to the end. Watch it.
0061537969|5.0|Many times I forgot that the narrator was a dog and had to remind myself.  Such a deep character.  It was nice to hear anothing side of the story; life through the eyes of man's best friend.  it was funny how he used the words we and us like he was just one of the other humans.  It was a sad story but with many happy moments also and overall hopeful and uplifting.  This dog has a lot to teach us.
B00328G4XY|5.0|This is a fantastic album (all the JHE albums are fantastic) and the remastering is excellent, although I am certain its the same remastering as the 1997 releases. If you've got those you're only buying these for the 20 minute DVDs (that you'll watch once).    But...I wonder what they'll do to get us to buy it next time? I'm betting original mono mix (it is different) as well as the stereo (and I think the unexpected demand for the Beatles mono releases will help here).    Then a couple of years after that we'll probably get a 5.1 version as well (I'd buy that - if ever there was an artist made for surround sound it was Jimi - as a few downloadable bootlegs - especially the EL one - make clear). After all you can get Pet Sounds in mono/stereo/reverse stereo (although that was probably a DVD-A mistake) and 5.1 - and they all sound great...    After 30+ years I'm losing count of how many times I've bought these albums!
0385504225|5.0|Another astounding and outstanding book by Dan Brown.  Though you may get lost in the history of the masons and their language, you will feel the same urgency to know the answers to the ancient mysteries as the characters themselves.  As the plot seems to unfold it becomes more and more intense and mysterious at the same time.  I had to keep myself from looking ahead because I was so eager to see what would happen next.  You'll never be able to guess the ending as usual.  Second favorite Dan Brown book.

That and there wasn't ANY of the magic of Old Man's War here. Old Man's War is one of my favorite books of ALL time. LOVED IT, read it often... The Lost Colony, cash grab. Scalzi is starting to smell like Orson Scott Card. If you think you'd like to read more in this universe, do yourself a favor and just read Old Man's War again.

1439190275|5.0|When I was diagnosed as diabetic I went immediately to Atkins. What could make more sense, carbs drive insulin get rid of the carbs get rid of the insulin spike. After 3 yrs my diabetis is still diet controlled. My cholesterol went from 230 to 190 with the hdl going from 35 to 66 and trigl from 140 to 77. As for if vegetarian is better maybe a good read would be The Vegeterian Myth. A vegan who has serious medical problems because of 20 yrs eating that way and who no longer eats vegan. Low carb is definately the correct way to go for those with metabolic unbalance. Which are all diabetics and most overweight people.  And if one was to really read what the way to eat is at the end of the program I would put it up against any other diet out there. Its a life style change.

Now that I'm almost 25, and a parent, I can say that this book is still special, and it's not nostalgia that's talking here. Even better, my daughter loves it as much as I did at that age.    If you don't know the story by now, then you should feel silly since this is such a well-known book. Max is a young boy who runs around in his wolf costume. When he's caused enough trouble, his mom sends him to his room without eating anything. Soon though, his room becomes a forest, and he finds a boat that takes him to where the Wild Things are. Here he fits in, and becomes their king, but soon misses home after smelling good things to eat.    That's really the whole story, told with just a few sentences, but also with some amazing illustrations. Every drawing in this book is a treasure in itself. Maurice Sendak will probably always be best known for his drawings here, and that's not a bad thing either- his drawings of the Wild Things were unlike any monsters I'd seen as a little boy, and most other kids when the book came out in the 60s. They're based on his Jewish aunts and uncles (his words, taken from his art collection book), and you have to wonder how they really looked if this is how the drawings turned out. But there are a few wonderful, two-page illustrations here that don't have any text. What's going on is up to you and your child. It works your imagination, and to this day, I can stare at those pages for minutes at a time, thinking up things about what Max and the others are doing during their Wild Rumpus. While I -can- see how the Wild Things might scare some children, they should already know this book's about monsters whenyou read them the title. Two of them in here really did scare me as a kid, but I'd stay put and let the story finish. Maybe it just depends on what the child's exposed to.    There were a lot of books I'd read on a regular basis when I was little, and most of them can't be found in book stores any more. Where the Wild things Are is seemingly eternal, and is always available at a book store, or a chain store's book section. I hate to sound like a fanboy that can't find anything negative about something he likes, but there's really nothing bad I can say about this book*, and I'm normally good at doing that. The book's short, has gorgeous illustrations, and stands the test of time. While the movie definitely wasn't for everyone, there's always the original book. If you don't have this yet, do yourself a favor and pick up a copy today. Don't you remember the days when you'd have a world all to yourself? This could take you back to that time.        * = Though I do hate the people that have written essays about the different 'themes' of the book, overanalyzing every single little detail and going on about how even the color of Max's boat represents something deeper than it just being a color. Some people, eh?
1591843162|4.0|\\"I must work the works of Him who sent Me while it is day; the night is coming when no one can work.\\" -- John 9:4 (NKJV)<br /><br />Seth Godin painstakingly explains in Linchpin how the world of work has shifted so that \\"just doing your job\\" is a recipe for being dead while you still live . . . and having lots of job insecurity. His solution is for you to care about the results of your work, to reach out to others with your genuine emotions, and to innovate in ways that create something others appreciate . . . whether or not it has immediate economic value. Basically, he's suggesting you become a human being rather than a cog in a bureaucracy or complex process. He calls this being an artist.<br /><br />I found this aspect of the book to be its main strength: A lot of people don't realize that they need to be innovating in ways that delight other people . . . rather than just pretending they are still in high school and trying to get along by fitting in.<br /><br />I dislike mechanical metaphors as a way to encourage people to be less machine-like. Linchpin as a metaphor didn't work that well for me. His point is that since everyone else is just going through the motions of following orders, your humanity in seeking to make things better will make you indispensable. It's nice to think that's true, but the book doesn't contain any evidence beyond some anecdotes . . . many of which are about people I've never heard of or read about.<br /><br />The writing style suggests that a lot of the book is mostly a cut-and-paste job from blogs. If that's the kind of choppy writing that appeals to you, you'll like this book better than I did. I thought it could have used a good editor. Why? You have to read a long time before he gets around to defining a lot of his concepts. In the meantime, you are wondering what he's trying to tell you.<br /><br />A solution for this lack of orderly development of his ideas is to start with the drawing on page 230 and go on to read the summary that follows. Then, go back and read the book from front to back. It will make a lot more sense that way.<br /><br />Despite the book's weaknesses, if you haven't decided to make the world a better place by being a caring innovator, you need this book. Get a copy and read it . . . and keep reading it until the point sinks in. I think it eventually will.he book from front to back. It will make a lot more sense that way.

B0037AGASG|1.0|I liked the single Baby but the whole cd is not good at all. It's one of those cds that by the end of the song you already forgot about it. This album could've been better than this. Don't get me wrong he does have potential so hopefully his next album, if there is even one, will be better maybe once he gets a little older.
B001EO2UJK|3.0|The sound on this Genesis boxed set is frustrating.  There are so many areas of the sound that are improved.  Primarily resolution/detail/clarity.  But in my opinion, the mixing is not homogeneous and natural on the CDs.  The dts surround sound is much better, but I cannot enjoy these outside my home surround sound system.    On the CDs, lower midrange seems to be missing.  Piano sounds clear, but tinny and without body (Firth on Fifth piano solo on dts is so much more realistic and balanced compared to the CD)  Cymbals are too forward and splashy.  They overexpose the distortion of the old recordings, and would have been much better pulled back to the drum set.  Bass is over-the-top, but I like it.  Voice is clear, but lacks heft and feels overpowered by all the other detail brought forward.  The new detail is incredible compared to past releases, but is presented on the CD in a manner that throws the \\"new\\" detail in your face.  As much as I love this music, I can hardly turn these CDs up half way without wear and tear.  Small changes in the equalizing and mixing could have made such a difference on the listenability.  A missed opportunity in my book.    Rating:  2 for CDs, 4+ for surround sound, 3 average
0802714544|4.0|the book was fantastic from start to finish.  the story moves very quickly and isn't overly long.  if you like other books like Our Man in Havana by Graham Greene, I would highly recommend this book.
B001PJRAUS|5.0|I bought this and had it shipped to Chile and do not regret it! (It was the only way of getting it over here).  Its plot is wonderfully achieved, especially for those Austenites that will never have enough of P&P.  If you have read the book or watched the film versions you will get all the inside jokes which make the experience a laughing-out-loud one. (If you haven't, maybe you should before watching this one, otherwise YOU will be the lost one).   I totally recommend it. I have watched it with most of my friends and all of them have loved it.
0761944524|5.0|I am a grad student in psychology and although this book is geared towards \\"undergrads\\" it has been very very helpful with really understanding stats, how to use SPSS, and how to write them up.  It contains syntax files with things you can't do by a drop down menu and also helps with assumptions, and pre-processing of the data, so to speak, before main analyses.  It is also fun to read, which amazing for a stats book.  I recommend this book for any graduate student in psychology.
B002VECLVO|5.0|The elegance of Tom Ford's film has stayed with me for days. Based on the Christopher Isherwood novel of the same name, the picture studies a day in the life of George Falconer, a gay college professor whose partner has recently died in an accident. As we might expect from Ford, the renowned fashion designer, it proves a work of art in every respect, with close due paid to subtlety and nuance--right down to the glowing tip of its pink cigarettes. And the sets, costumes, and musical score are, of course, divine.<br /><br />Cinematographer Eduard Grau has lensed the film with a palette ranging from highly saturated color to soft, brown-filtered grain. The action would seem to happen in pastel. Ford's people are so very pretty, from Colin Firth's impeccably groomed professor, to Nicholas Hoult's wide-eyed schoolboy, to Julianne Moore's gin-soaked fading flower. In stark contrast to the film's grief-infused theme, each surface, everywhere we rest our eyes, is lovely, pointing toward one of Isherwood's meditations: Sometimes in great pain lies great beauty. As George discovers, grief can slow the world's pace, offering appreciation of the many details we may have otherwise missed: the sensual grace of a mouth, the buoyant spirit of an all-too-honest child, the aching heart of a lonely young man yearning for connection.<br /><br />Having lived the typical life of a gay professional man in midcentury America, George has been walled behind a web of facades. His upper-class British background has wrought a template of strictures. He has successfully hidden a 16-year relationship with a much-younger man from all but his closest friends and family. And in his obsessive devotion to the surface details of his life, he appears to be even a mystery to himself. The film is set during the Cuban missile crisis of October 1962, when fear and paranoia have spiked to epic levels, and even in Los Angeles, a gay professor at a small college can be given no quarter. But curiously enough, he and his partner have built an elegant glass house in Santa Monica, bringing the light of day into their quiet existence and allowing those who would look to glimpse the truth.<br /><br />This is just one of many metaphors Isherwood puts forth in his deceptively simple story. Himself a gay man, he seems to have clearly understood and reckoned with the apparent necessity for walls in a hostile environment, and the deep sensitivity they sequester.<br /><br />Ford has wisely selected his cast, all of whom turn in outstanding performances. Each is pitch-perfect and skillfully directed by the fashion designer, who solely funded this project after years with Yves St.-Laurent and Gucci. Foremost is Colin Firth, who's received an Oscar nod for his adept rendering of the complex character behind the horn-rims. And young actor Nicholas Hoult positively glows in his white mohair sweater and cr&egrave;me-colored jeans, the epitome of twink naivete.<br /><br />A film littered with such seductive trappings is a pleasure to watch. But observing what lies beneath as it bubbles to the surface like a lily bursting through blacktop is the real joy of this subtle masterpiece.

1596680180|3.0|Let me preface my review by stating that I am a professional artist. I am always looking to expand my creative vocabulary and decided to explore the art of braiding.     This is a beautifully designed, well written guide to braiding for the novice. The step by step photos and clear instructions had me knocking out braids left and right. It's a real page turner. So imagine my dismay when I turned page 107 to discover that I had finished Section One and the new technique tutorials were over. I counted approximately 25 braiding techniques plus finishing instructions.     Section Two - \\"The Braid and Trim Collection\\" is just that; a gallery of examples of each of the previously taught techniques. Each of these images includes a list or diagram of the materials used so that you can replicate the braid. I was expecting another 125 NEW braiding techniques instead of more than 125 pages of variations on a theme. Hence the disappointment.    I was not looking for a pattern book. As inspiring as the braids in Section Two are, I feel that a much smaller sampling of what can be achieved by varying materials would have sufficed.
089898890X|5.0|John Riley is an excellent jazz drummer, with extraordinary virtuosity. The key for THIS product is that he is a gifted \\"explainer\\" of both the technique or drumming figure being developed, as well as a quality provider of exercises to develop technique. The CD with examples and play-along tracks is also excellent. Highly recommend this product to any jazz drummer who wants to master the lexicon and tecnique of modern jazz drumming.
B00336C3EY|1.0|Don't bother with the cerebral analysis some folks are trying to attach to this movie - it is a complete waste of time. Ask yourself \\"Why is this new release- watch it now option- going for $1.99 when all other new releases are $3.99\\" Is it because it's a bargain? NOT - you can't give this movie away! Slow and boring doesn't even begin to cover the tedious dullness of this film. If you are tied to a chair and forced to watch this, at least drink heavily so you can immediately pass out and save yourself from a stunning waste of film.

0670034711|2.0|This is my first taste of chick lit.  I enjoyed immensely EATing, found PRAYing ponderous and self-important, and found LOVE just odd.  So our heroine who speaks no Indonesian befriends a Balinese woman and then writes to her myriad of wealthy friends and buys her a house!  Our heroine has a serious Santa Claus syndrome. What will the effect of acts like this be on your ordinary Balinese meeting foreigners?<br /><br />Soon Bali will face a tsunami of EPL carrying divorcees bring their emotional baggage.  One woman who I met here in Ubud has followed in our heroine's footsteps, spending four months in Italy, India and now Bali.

0312360258|1.0|I cannot for the life of me fathom how this series is so popular.  The dialogue is atrocious, the storyline is weak, and the characters are some of the most unlikeable people I have ever come across in any novels-particularly the protagonist.  This book is filled with laughable dialogue that teenagers today apparently use...including words like \\"poopies\\", \\"boobies\\", and more soon-to-be outdated pop cultural references than you can count.  I am so sorry I wasted even a second of my time trying to read this book.  Halfway through, I began skimming over the pages quickly just to see if perhaps the ending would be satisfying.  I should have known better.  If you are an intelligent reader who has a great respect for true literature in all its glorious forms, stay away from this series.
B002IVLH60|5.0|This is a great album.  Eddie Vedders soulful voice wins me over every time.

1439148953|2.0|What a waste it was spending time with this story's main character, Eilis.  She starts out being simply uninteresting, and then, after rallying for a period during which she actually begins to manifest some personality, she ultimately withers into someone pathetically indecisive, insubstantial, and dislikable.  Save yourselves!  Read something else!
B0016MOWP0|5.0|Everbody's gone surfin', even the FBI. I like this movie alot. I don't care how unrealistic it is. It does not matter. This was pure entertainment for me. I love the Loooooong conversations during freefall. I did the math. 32'/second/second
B000MR9D5E|5.0|I would definitely recommend this series to everyone! The narration by Sir David Attenborough is nothing short of pure entertainment and is only eclipsed by the beautiful cinematography in each segment. Both of these elements come together well and are worth re-watching again and again!

B001NFNFF8|4.0|A good solid story acted well, with lots of recognizable landmarks for all of you coonasses out there. Tommy Lee Jones does not seem to be capable of making a bad movie. This is no academy award winner, but a good solid story that is well done, and has the \\"Dude\\" or your Dudeness, front and center.Squeeeal!
B002BD4UGE|4.0|Every Ratt fan knows this album, so I won't go into artist/album quality too much- just that this is my favorite.  I've been waiting for this album to be remastered for awhile and this is as good as it gets for now.  Sure it's expensive as a SHMCD 24-bit master (not advertised as \\"remastered\\") release, but there is a definite sound improvement over the original CD release.  The one con: the mastering tends to have \\"muddy\\" bass compared to all the tracks that are currently available on the Ratt remastered compilation CD's.  About half of the tracks are available on remastered compilations.  \\"Deep end bass\\" on the remasters tends to sound like \\"mid-bass\\" on this release.  On a high-end system with a subwoofer this is the case, but on portables such as an mp3 player it's not nearly as noticable.  Who knows, maybe this release is a \\"flat\\" transfer true to the original master tape.  Whether it's worth purchasing, it's how much of a fan you are of Ratt- for half of the tracks sounding better than what's currently available.
B001FB55LC|3.0|I liked this movie, but I felt like I was watching an episode of my favorite soap opera.  It was all to easy to know what was going to happen next. The acting by all the characters  especially the little girls was very good.
B002N1AEN2|5.0|I first fell in love with \\"Intro,\\" the first track on this album, with that stupid Apolo Ohno commercial during the Olympics for AT&T.  I thought I was buying the album for ONE song (because I'm crazy like that), and then ended up being blown away by the rest of the CD.  I was amazed by how good the whole thing actually is.  I can listen to it over an over again and never get tired of it.      The album is haunting in a way--particularly the female vocalist.  The writing is decent, and I can't say enough about the music.  Unfortunately, I'm not articulate enough to come up with cool ways to say it...just buy this album. It's awesome.  I love the whole thing, but I think my two favorite songs on there are \\"Intro\\" and \\"Shelter.\\"    BUY IT!    Tiffiny
B0000524CY|5.0|After years of having only seen the tail end of this movie in re-runs on TV, I finally bought the DVD, and found that the high point is right at the beginning. For me, the Exorcist has something which is sorely lacking in rival diabolic-possession movies (the Shining, the Omen, etc): the devil's Middle Eastern origins. Everything else in the film is just icing on the cake. Incidentally, I wouldn't recommend Exorcist II/the Heretic, or Dominion, the prequel. If you want to watch the better prequel, and go back further to find out where the Devil came from, then you must watch \\"Exorcist: the Beginning\\".<br /><br />All hardcore Satanic-possession movies, I think, should have at least some acknowledgement of the Devil's origins, complete with Middle Eastern music in the soundtracks, to give an air of genuineness to the story. The Exorcist is the only one I've watched so far which fills that bill---and the way it does so is a hard act to follow.
B0030IIYWA|5.0|I pre-ordered Toy Story 1 and 2 on blu ray from amazon.  This is probably the smartest buy I've made in awhile.  Not only do they give you the pre-order price guarantee (which I saved $4 for that), and not only do they give you $10 back for buying them together, BUT they also have in there redemption codes that get you a free ticket to see Toy Story 3 in each movie (so that's two free tickets to see Toy Story 3).      When I first bought them, they were $24.99 each...so let's say with both of them, that's $50.00.    Minus the $4 pre-order price guarentee=$46.00    Minus the $10 promotion=$36.00    Minus the $17 ($8.50 for each ticket) for the TS3 movie tickets= $19.00    That means I spent $9.50 on each movie.  With how old these movies are, that may still be a bit pricey to some people, but with it being a new release on blu ray, I call that a smart buy!    Thank you, amazon.com!
0670021652|5.0|Gilbert has done it again!!! Like Eat, Pray, Love - this book is absolutely wonderful. If you are skeptical about the institution of marriage, then you will find some really interesting information packed within these pages.

Give it a try, Elizabeth Gilbert is nothing short of an amazing writer. 5 stars!

1439190275|5.0|This new book is full to the brim of the most current scientific data.  All of the science is moving in the direction of the Atkins Nutritional Approach.  After reading Gary Taubes, \\"Good Calories, Bad Calories\\" and this new Atkins book, I've changed my way of eating for life.      If you have a bad opinion of Atkins, it's quite likely because you haven't read the actual program or the science behind it.  Perhaps you have just heard what it is or perhaps you've listened to what others think the program is.  That's how I did \\"Atkins\\" in the 90s but I didn't do anything correctly and of course eventually gained the 28 lbs I lost back.      Today, I eat more veggies than ever.  I eat good healthy foods such as flax, nuts, lean proteins, healthy oils and there is very little I won't be able to add back into my diet eventually.  But when I do, I'll be in control and not at the whims of my blood sugar levels driving me to compulsively eat.      I've had the joy of watching as dozens of people I have come to know through the Atkins' message board, have put away their insulin and diabetes medications with their doctors' permission because of this program.  With diabetes running in my family, I've listened and learned to prevent it's devastation happening to me.  This book and this program are life-saving!

B002Q9VPFM|4.0|I ordered \\"The Ultimate Cut\\" for three reasons.<br />1.  I had a gift card so it only cost me around $12.00<br />2.  I wanted \\"Under The Hood\\"<br />3.  I wanted the audio commentary.<br />Let me just say it was worth the $12.00 I paid for it.<br />Under the hood was interesting but could have been a lot better.  It's one of my favorite parts of the graphic novel so my expectations were pretty high.<br />The audio commentary however, was fantastic.  I enjoyed listening to Zack Snyder but Dave Gibbons was fantastic.  He was insightful, interesting and funny.  It's too bad Alan Moore bowed out because I think the two of them together would have been incredible.<br />The director's cut is wonderful.  I can't watch the theatrical version anymore.<br />The Black Freighter, however, was incredibly annoying.  I didn't like it in the graphic novel and I hated it in the movie.  The only good thing about it is they added a few new scenes before/after the cartoon.  I watched it so I could voice an opinion and now I just skip past it when I watch the movie.<br />Overall, I love this movie.  But if it weren't for the three reasons I stated above I would just have the Director's Cut.

0156030322|4.0|A book that does not joke around. Enough back story to know the characters, enough action to keep you on your toes, and enough darkness to make you stay away from the west coast for life.<br /><br />Driver, a stunt driver who falls into the business of getaway driving for robberies, is a bit smarter and more talented than he seems. Growing up learning the tricks of the street, he puts his knowledge of fighting, guns, and knives to use to fend off the mob when a burglary goes sour.<br /><br />Not quirky, but pretty deep for such a short story. Very enjoyable. Really shows how small we all are in life as Driver realizes with each act of violence, nothing changes, the world keeps on living as it did and always will. Price is a bit high for such a small book, but worth rereading down the road. And down this road, hopefully you are not in Driver's shoes.

B002RI9SC4|2.0|I loved all three books leading up to this one and couldn't wait to get my teeth into the final one,however this book is nothing like the other three.If i didn't know better i'd have thought it was a different author entirely.The writing style is different,the characters become two dimentional immitations of those we've come to love (edward especially looses depth and sensuality seen in the previous books) and the plot just goes crazy,with unbelievable and rushed events.This book really lets the series down and makes itself very clearly aimed at the younger audience rather than us older fans.I'd only recommend this if you're truely desperate to find out what happens,otherwise do yourself a favour and preserve your memories of Edward and Jacob as they are!This does nothing for the series.
B00026WUAU|5.0|In the early to mid 1960s Bob Dylan so often led the way and the opposition followed as best they could.  Having said that I don't own any of the 1960s classic albums, unless you include Nashville Skyline.  While his landmark releases Blowin' In The Wind, Mr Tambourine Man, Like A Rolling Stone and others are rightly in his Greatest Hits/Best Of, I don't find the other songs as essential.  Most of my Dylan albums are from the late 1970s to early 1980s.  Of Street Legal's 9 tracks, I not too taken with True Love Tends To Forget, We Better Talk This Over and Where Are You Tonight? (Journey Through Dark Heat).  It's the first 6 songs which are really worth hearing.  They flow easily with Dylan's voice sounding as good as ever and I would pick 3 of them as outstanding.  Baby Please Stop Crying was given a lot of radio play in 1978, Is Your Love In Vain is another love song and finally Senor (Tales Of Yankee Power) addresses the questionable role the USA has played in world affairs.  The remastered version improves considerably from the earlier CD pressing.
B003BLE88U|2.0|Let me first say that I really enjoy listening to this CD. It IS good stuff but the major problem I found was the major false advertising on the part of Experience Hendrix and Sony Legacy. They put a big sticker right on the front of the packaging that says \\"Over 60 Minutes Of Unheard Jimi Hendrix\\" when that's far from the truth.     What you *actually* get is 1 new track and 2 new instrumental tracks for a total of 3 tracks that are truly *new.* The other 11 tracks are songs that have appeared on another main Hendrix release in the form of another version. Technically you could say that \\"Crying Blue Rain\\" is a new song because Jimi says \\"Yeah\\" a handful of times on the song but besides that one word, there are no lyrics.    Astonishingly, Experience Hendrix and Sony Legacy took the liberty of actually re-titling some of the songs just to make them appear *new* but anyone who knows many Hendrix tunes will pick up on these.     Below I've listed the track list with two sets of parentheses. The first set of parentheses tells if the song is an alternate version of a released song as well as clarifies if it was re-tilted and which song it actually is. The second set of parentheses tells which Hendrix album the song appeared on.     1 - Stone Free (Alternate Version Of Song)(Are You Experienced?)   2 - Valleys Of Neptune (New Song)   3 - Bleeding Heart (Alternate Version)(South Saturn Delta)&(Blues)   4 - Hear My Train A Comin' (Alternate Version)(Blues)   5 - Mr. Bad Luck (Alternate Version Of Look Over Yonder Just Re-titled)(South Saturn Delta)   6 - Sunshine Of Your Love (New Instrumental)   7 - Lover Man (Alternate Version)(South Saturn Delta)   8 - Ships Passing In The Night (Alternate Version Of Night Bird Flying Just Re-titled)(First Rays Of The New Rising Sun)   9 - Fire (Alternate Version)(Are You Experienced?)   10 - Red House (Alternate Version)(Blues)   11 - Lullaby For Summer (Alternate Instrumental Version Of Ezy Ryder Just Re-titled)(First Rays Of The NewRising Sun)   12 - Crying Blue Rain (New Instrumental)   13 - Slow Version (Available On Hear My Music From Experience Hendrix/Dagger Records)   14 - Trash Man (Available On Hear My Music From Experience Hendrix/Dagger Records)    Now, I can hear the die hards already saying \\"This is new Hendrix man, these are studio recordings.\\" I agree with that to an extent. However, regardless if this is \\"Jimi\\" stuff or not, false advertising is false advertising.     When you buy \\"Over 60 Minutes Of Unheard Jimi Hendrix\\" music, and you've *heard* 11 of the 14 songs on various other Hendrix albums, that's an issue. Experience Hendrix knows much better than doing what they've done with this \\"new\\" album, which is demonstrated by their release of the albums South Saturn Delta and First Rays Of The New Rising Sun which really DID include new tracks.     It appeared when they released South Saturn Delta and First Rays Of The New Rising Sun that they were attempting to clean up the scattering of releases that chopped up all of Jimi's work after his passing which I applaud.     Instead of being billed as a new *album*, Valleys Of Neptune should have been accurately billed as *studio sessions & alternate takes* with a couple of bonus tracks to account for the 2-3 new songs. Another accurate way to think of this disc is as if it were one of the discs from the 4 disc, Jimi Hendrix Experience Boxed set which had alternate versions of songs with a couple of new tracks sprinkled on each disc.     Again, I do love this CD. If properly advertised, I would have had no problem giving this release 4 solid stars, possibly 5. I am keeping it and playing the heck out of it...this is great music and is a great disc.     Hopefully Experience Hendrix has a quality control team that reads market reactions such as these reviews on Amazon and will take this information to heart and properly advertise their releases from now on and hopefully we'll get a real album of new material because it does exist.
B00328G4V6|5.0|I been a Jimi fan since 1982, I fig I had just about all the Hednrix material, be it bootleg or official releases. This new CD Valleys of Neptune tho offers a excellent collection of songs and terrific production.<br />Many of the songs I have already had but with inferior sound (Mr bad luck, Lover man, ect).<br />the song selection and production is so well put together, you'd think it was a original Jimi album that came out right after \\"Electric ladyland\\" in 1968. After many sub-par Hendrix CD releases (with excpetions to First rays of the new Rising Sun\\" and \\"Blues\\") thi CD delivers!<br />It sounds fresh and hip and young or old will enjoy this CD. It amazingly is in Billboards top 10 Album charts.....not just the rock charts or some specialty chart, but the legit top 200 Album charts!  It's a truly amazing accomplishment to see, but then agian, after hearing this CD, it's not hype, but the real deal!<br />My Only complaints are: 1. RED HOUSE fades outs. I'm not sure if this studio take broke down and was never completed or just shortened for times sake. A real let down, as it is a great variation of the song. If it did break down, I wish they just let us hear it until it did break down, if they faded it out for times sake...shame on them!<br />My only otrher complaint is that there are 2 BONUS songs on this CD but one is sold in Target stores and the other is iTtunes. I say quit the gimmicks and release it worldwide with the 14 tracks.<br />A few notes: On \\"Bleeding Heart\\" this is not the version or a alternate mix of the song found on \\"War Heroes\\" or \\"South Saturn Delta\\" but a completely new take of the song and has one the most awesome Guitar solos by Jimi!<br />\\"Trash man\\" appeared on the Alan Douglas produced butchered album \\"Midnight Lightning\\" in 1975. This is the original mix of the song and it rocks!<br />\\"Stone Free\\" from 1969 sounds like the same take as found on the 2000 box set, but a alternate mix, both mixes are great and yet so different.<br />\\"Valleys of Neptune\\" the song is a great take of the song and was briefly released on the \\"jimi Hendrix Story\\" but that has been out of print for ages now.<br />\\"Hear My trin a Comin\\" agian first appeared on 1975's \\"Midnight Lightning\\" but with added studio musicians and a different mix. This version is actually a better mix, which makes me wonder why Alan Douglas re-produced the song in the first place?<br />A few songs \\"missing\\" from this CD that wouda fit in great was the studio version of \\"Machine Gun\\" from 1969 and \\"Sending My Love to Linda\\" but oh well, the CD still is awesome.<br />it has it all, slow blues to hard rocking tunes....put on your 'ear goggles\\" and enjoy!t take of the song and was briefly released on the \\"jimi Hendrix Story\\" but that has been out of print for ages now.  \\"Hear My trin a Comin\\" agian first appeared on 1975's \\"Midnight Lightning\\" but with added studio musicians and a different mix.

B00328G4V6|2.0|Let me first say that I really enjoy listening to this CD.  It IS good stuff but the major problem I found was the major false advertising on the part of Experience Hendrix and Sony Legacy.  They put a big sticker right on the front of the packaging that says \\"Over 60 Minutes Of Unheard Jimi Hendrix\\" when that's far from the truth.    What you *actually* get is 1 new track and 2 new instrumental tracks for a total of 3 tracks that are truly *new.*  The other 9 tracks are songs that have appeared on another main Hendrix release in the form of another version.  Technically you could say that \\"Crying Blue Rain\\" is a new song because Jimi says \\"Yeah\\" a handful of times on the song but besides that one word, there are no lyrics.

B002FOQY04|5.0|This soundtrack is not for the liking of everyone, but if you like his music you can truly appreciate this album from beginning to end, just like myself. He is an amazing artist, I've even seen some of his screen work and he's just overly talented. And his approach to the way he does his work is non- conventional and has a great twist that his fans can truly appreciate.
1934356476|5.0|I know a lot of people might be turned off by the idea of \\"metaprogramming\\", but this book is a very good, clear and concise description of how Ruby simply *works*, and even if you don't do a lot of funky things with it, it'll help you understand scope, inheritance, etc...  Highly recommended.
006074815X|5.0|Fantastic story and one of Follett's best.  This and \\"Pillars of the Earth\\" are his best in my opinion.  You will love this book.  It provides some excellent historical fiction.
0061767581|1.0|Saying Lauren Conrad is an \\"author\\" is like saying Paris Hilton is an \\"author\\" back when her book came out too.  It is funny to watch reality TV bimbos try to gain credibility by writing books or becoming designers when the real reality is that they are just untalented but well connected people.
B00005JM02|5.0|My 3 year old loves Finding Nemo!!! She would watch it all day if I would let her. It's an adorable movie and everyone of all ages can appreciate it. Definately a family favorite :)
1416562605|3.0|The situation and language is compelling, but the concept is over extended.  His book \\"Between The Assassinations\\" is better.
B000093BDX|2.0|I remember them as being better than this. The recording was weak. There was very little dynamic range. Bass was absent. I was very disappointed. Better pass this one up.

B0019LY5IM|4.0|Many mysteries are revealed during the fifth season of Lost, one of the most entertaining seasons yet.  All the main characters are back.  Jack, with the help of Ben, tries to persuade the rest of the Oceanic Six to return to the island.  Meanwhile, Sawyer creates a new life for himself as a DHARMA security man in the 70s.  Two episodes stand out as my favorites here: \\"316\\" is the journey back to the island, and \\"The Life and Death of Jeremy Bentham\\" explains just what happened to Locke when he left the island, including how he died.  Time travel is the major theme of this season, and certain episodes require multiple viewings to fully understand.  But in typical Lost fashion, those who pay attention to details are rewarded.  Season 5 ends on a great note with \\"The Incident\\", which could possible change the fate of Jack, Kate, Sawyer, and all the other characters on the island.  This is must-see TV!<br /><br />As great as the Season 5 content is, I have several problems with the actual DVD package.  First of all, for those who own Seasons 1-4, you will notice a big difference in the box this time around.  Not a huge problem, but the inconsistent package looks weird sitting on a shelf next to the first four seasons.  Secondly, there is no booklet included with the episode summaries.  As a substitute, the episode titles are printed on the inside of the DVD case.  Perhaps the DHARMA Orientation Kit version is the better (although more expensive) way to go [[ASIN:B0027CSPOC Lost: The Complete Fifth Season Dharma Initiative Orientation Kit]].  Bonus features also seem to be a bit light this time around.<br /><br />In conclusion, the extras and packaging of Season 5 is a bit disappointing.  But that cannot overshadow the fact that Lost is still going strong after five seasons, and Season 5 is a worthy entry into the Lost universe.
B00005S6K8|5.0|[[ASIN:B00005S6K8 Sabrina]]    This version, in my opinion, is superior to the earlier original one played by William Holden, Humprhey Bogart, and Audrey Hepburn. Sounds impossible with the earler cast of greats, but I enjoyed this one better. A great story of a top executive trying to keep a Help's daughter from marrying his younger brother so his business deal would not fall through, but the plan falls apart when the top executive, Harrison Ford, realizes he has fallen in love with this much younger woman. The movie has sentmentality, humor, and has a great story line. I recommend it for all Harrison Ford fans and who loves great acting, and a truly romantic story.
B0018CWEYY|5.0|Lost Season 4 is considerably shorter than the previous seasons of 23-24 episodes.  With just 13 episodes, it seems as though you'd be getting less value.  But what you actually get is less time wasted (as with Season 3) and more dense episodes that are packed with information.  The big change in Season 4 is the extensive use of flash-forwards, so that we actually begin to learn who will eventually make it off the island.  It is soon discovered that six people made it back to the real world; this group comes to be known as the Oceanic Six.  Just who is in the Oceanic Six is the mystery, as they are revealed one by one as the season progresses.  Seeing how these people, Jack in particular, have changed post-crash is one of the highlights of season 4.<br /><br />Season 4: \\"The Expanded Experience\\" is a 6-DVD set.  The first four discs are devoted to the episodes, and the last two are for bonus material.  There are some interesting bonus features this season, including \\"The Island Backlot\\" and \\"The Freighter Folk\\".  Also included is a \\"Lost in 8:15\\" segment to briefly catch up those who are rusty on their Lost facts.  \\"The Oceanic Six: A Conspiracy of Lies\\" is a fictional documentary that is quite amusing and well-made.  \\"The Right to Bear Arms\\" is a feature that explains that it is actually someone's job to keep track of which characters have which guns at any given point in time.  As usual, there are several cast commentaries, plus one with show creators Damon Lindelof and Carlton Cuse.  I find the commentaries to be less informative than I would have hoped.<br /><br />The Season 4 packaging remains constant with the first three seasons, although the episode guide booklet is replaced with a less-important but humorous Oceanic safety brochure.  But this is a minor complaint in what is otherwise a great DVD set for a great season of Lost.
B0011UBDTK|5.0|How can you ever get bored of this show!!! I love having the entire collection and am having a blast re-watching the first seasons.
B000FIMG68|5.0|As a huge fan of the first season of Lost, I was anxious to get started watching Season 2.  Season One ended with two major questions: \\"Where did the Others take Walt?\\" and \\"What is inside the hatch?\\".  One of these questions is answered in Season Two's opening episode, titled \\"Man of Science, Man of Faith\\".  There are many great episodes this season, but the most unique is \\"The Other 48 Days\\", when we learn about the people on the tail section of the plane, and how their fight to survive on the island and their struggle with the Others is not all that different from that of our main cast of survivors.  Around halfway through the season, we introduce a new character, \\"Henry Gale\\", played by the fantastic Michael Emerson.  The season finale provides an explanation of what caused the crashing of Oceanic Flight 815.  Season 2 of Lost is a must see!<br /><br />As with the first season's DVD set, Season 2 has seven discs - six discs full of episodes, with one disc for bonus material.  The best piece of bonus material in the set is the documentary \\"Fire + Water\\", a detailed look at the production of an episode from concept to completion.  \\"Lost Connections\\" is an interactive feature that shows the past and present connections of any two characters - but it is very annoying to navigate through.  \\"The World According to Sawyer\\" is the funniest bit on the bonus disc; it's a 3-minute montage of Sawyer's insults and pop culture references. There is a booklet that gives each episode title and gives a brief plot description.  The packaging is high-quality compared to other DVD box sets that I've seen.  Overall, this is a great show with adequate bonus material.
B000RZOR2U|5.0|I agree with Peter Watchorn's review. (I thought your name sounded familiar. I've seen it on credits on other CDs). I started to purchase the LP volumes when I was 15 years old (1974). I was so intrigued by the sound of the original instruments. It was as if I was transported back to Bach's time. In fact they actually helped me get through high school because I read the text as they performed and the words of faith helped when the bullies of high school and other things got me down. I continued to buy each volume as it came out until they started to come out on CD in the mid 1980's. Then the complete set came out in 1994 and received it as a gift for my birthday. I still can't bring myself to sell or get rid of all those LP volumes because they have all those pictures of the performers and pictures of the original instruments which the CDs don't have. My most favorite Cantata is Leonhardt's performance of the Actus Tragicus BWV106. I've tried Koopman's series, Rifkin series, and Gardiners and none seem to have the magic that Leonhardt and Harnoncourt bring to it. Maybe it's because I grew up with their records or maybe not. Maybe it's because the sound of the boy's choirs is so ingrained in me that when I hear it done by adults it just does not work for me. I don't really know.
B000P6YNSE|4.0|Season 3 of Lost is my least favorite season of the show so far, but that's not to say it is bad. It still has it moments of greatness. The first half of the season deals with our main castaways being held captive by the Others. Kate and Sawyer spend a lot of time together, and Jack meets an Other named Juliet. The complex relationships between the characters creates more tension than in previous seasons. If you care more about the characters and their relationships, this season might be for you. Fans of the science fiction aspects of Lost, who want the answers to their questions about the island and the DHARMA initiative, will have to wait until the second half of the season to get a taste of what they're looking for. My personal favorite episode is \\"The Man From Tallahassee\\", in which we learn about how Locke came to be in a wheelchair. The scenes between Michael Emerson (Ben) and Terry O'Quinn (Locke) are just fun to watch.<br /><br />Just as the previous two seasons of Lost, Season 3 is a seven-disc set with plenty of bonus material. There are the usual Lost Flashbacks, which are never-before-seen segments into a character's past. The Lost on Location featurettes show various aspects of production of different episodes. The best feature in Season 3 is \\"Lost in a Day\\", where cameras take us into a time span of 24 hours, where seven episodes are in different stages - some being planned and written, others being filmed or edited.<br /><br />In summary, Season 3 is perhaps the weakest season of Lost, but it's still quite good and it moves the series into a new realm by giving more insight into the history of the Others, the DHARMA Initiative, and the powers of the island.

B002N83GYE|3.0|I enjoyed reading this book. You will see why Steve would not be thrilled with everything but it was told in a fair light. Not a bash, but not a fluff job either. Lots of insight on why things are the way they are at Apple and how Apple almost died.<br />The Issacson bio has much more insight into Jobs the man. Still worth reading
B0026OE2O8|4.0|Ok, I am in agreement with others that the major faux pas of the location of the Grand Canyon (in Colorado?) and age of cities (600 years?) is undeniably disturbing.  However, the visual journey is stunning.  Both impressive and disturbing, what you see is a summary of Earth's natural, unspoiled beauty and the worst side of man's \\"dominion\\" over the planet.  I would give this 5 stars for intention to provoke one to take action on behalf of a suffering planet minus one star for an obvious editing failure. Considering the production team is foreign, I am more willing to overlook the error in favor of artistry (10 stars if I could give it) and intention (wake up, people). This is a photographic/artistic masterpiece considering the image interpretation, execution of movement to highlight the subject and provocative lighting. This disc worth every cent and potentially an excellent learning tool for the classroom (to challenge kids to always question what they hear and read).
B001P9EQH8|5.0|I was looking for a decent amp to power my Sony MDR-V900 headphones, but I didn't really want something that was hard to carry around (or really expensive to boot).  The FiiO E5 is both ultra portable, and cost effective plus it actually does make a noticable difference in the way my headphones sound.  In comparison, I put my Sony's with the Fiio amp up against my friend's Dr. Dre Beats, and we were both pretty hard pressed to tell a difference!  That's not bad considering the price difference between this amp and the Dr. Dre Beats! :-)  So, with that said, I'd definitely recommend this amp to anyone looking for the same.
B002JCSWV6|4.0|\\"Invictus,\\" Clint Eastwood's latest film as director, is about the 1995 Rugby World Cupheld in South Africa, but it is not just about the sports or this particular event. The film is really about leadership in a divided country, represented by Nelson Mandela's decision to support the Springboks, the South African national rugby team. As far as the against-the-odds storyline goes, \\"Invictus\\" feels a little predictable. What is great about the film is that Eastwood has created an insightful portrait of a national leader without making it preachy.    Morgan Freeman is perfectly cast as Nelson Mandela, who was elected President of South Africa in 1994. He is aware that this is a most difficult task and knows any hasty or premature decision would lead the nation torn apart into confusion. Changing the national rugby team's color and name could result in more social tension, so the president shows up himself in a meeting of the South African Sports Committee, not to order, but to convince.    One day Nelson Mandela invites the rugby team's captain François Pienaar (Matt Damon) to his office. His intention is too clear though he never says it aloud. He chose the Springboks as a symbol for the country's unity. That means the national team, then not a very strong club, must win the World Cup. Everyone thought it was impossible. Of course, he knows better.    Maybe \\"Invictus\\" is not what you are looking for. As a rugby film, the film falls short of excitement that sports film provide, as the rugby scenes (especially the final game) often emphasizes the reactions of the audiences, not the game itself. As a bio-pic \\"Invictus\\" depicts mostly the short period after Nelson Mandela took office as president in 1994. His private life and Robben Island prison are only briefly shown.     After all, \\"Invictus\\" belongs to Morgan Freeman, who quietly rules the screen with his presence. It is an inspirational film made with Eastwood's sure-handed direction and Freeman's towering performance as Nelson Mandela.
0736092269|5.0|Frederic Delavier's stunning [[ASIN:0736092269 Strength Training Anatomy (Sports Anatomy Series)]] is an essential resource for any strength training enthusiast. While others have tried to mimic Delavier's incredible illustrations of muscle performance during strength training, no one comes close to capturing Delavier's level of detail and style. The pretenders either deliver sterile computer models or come off as second rate approximations of Delavier's unparalleled artwork.     One look and you'll be sold. The cover touts selling over a million copies of Strength Training Anatomy and its been the best selling strength training title at Amazon year-in and year-out.

0060512806|5.0|Let's rewrite Lord of the Rings cryptonomiconically:<br /><br />When Mr. Bilbo Baggins of Bag End announces that he will shortly be celebrating his eleventy-first birthday with a party of special magnificence, there is much talk and excitement in Hobbiton.<br /><br />Immediately, there is some tension, because the author's narration is set in present tense. Now, continuous use of present tense is tedious and stressful, except for Silverberg's 150 - 200 pages nano novels. So, what would it feel like if it was 900 pages in small type? Probably like a poor reader's Iron Maiden, crushing his mind as he's crying out to God to help him move through this.<br /><br />And amazingly, this is what we have in Cryptonomicon. Prayers answered, God who comes in many shapes, has now arrived in the shape of Neal Stephenson, living and working in Seattle, where I am sure he can be seen from Mexico, scratching his divine beard at NEO sitting on his 80 kilometer swivel chair.<br /><br />After a certain amount of pages (mote in God's eye: a rather large amount of pages), you'll stop worrying about the present tense and focus on the characters.<br /><br />Now, the characters. Reviewers who get 400 out 400 useful remarks have already described them in length, pointing out the connection with the writer's baroque cycles etc. I only want to humbly add that I found I cared for all 4 of the main characters in this weird Stephenson tarot deck, the Cryptanalyst, the Soldier, the Engineer and the Nerd (well, yes, the Immortal as well). And as I passed more days with them, I found I cared more and more about them, something that happens less and less with more and more pages of lesser writers. I was also satisfied by the Athena/Mars underlying motive and the grayscale amount of the heroes, the good guys/bad guys' line blurred with craft seldom found elsewhere.<br /><br />Mote in God's eye number 2: Too many similes in the first half of the novel. Apart from never reaching the \\"shall I compare you to a summer's day?\\" originality, all those attempts to say \\"X is like Z\\" feel more like insecure or inexperienced writers'  ways to point out how smart and brilliant they are. The fact is, that we know this. Otherwise, an Amazon reader called Neal Stephenson would be commenting on Adman's latest novel. So, really, we don't need those \\"I'm happier than a tornado in a trailer park\\" similes (which happens to be not from Cryptonomicon, but from the 3-d movie \\"Cars\\", so you know what I mean). However, at around page 300 Stephenson either realized the simile blunder or lifted to the godlike status described before and removed the mote.<br /><br />Finally: not a book for everybody. You must approach Cryptonomicon armed with time, intelligence and perhaps a basic (but no more) understanding of computers and mathematics. 5 stars.e attempts to say \\"X is like Z\\" feel more like insecure or inexperienced writers'  ways to point out how smart and brilliant they are.

B003A9OVS0|3.0|I've been a fan of Gorillaz for a while now. When they first appeared on the music scene, they had a very fresh sounding blend of musical styles. A lot of the music also had decent messages and definitely evoked certain feelings. This was what made me a fan. This album, though, just seemed to fall a little bit flat on my ears. While I don't hate any particular track, it doesn't seem to be speaking to me as much as Demon Days did. Demon Days quite often gets set on repeat on my MP3 player because I enjoy it that much. I found it to be great music to have on while working, writing, making art or just dancing around the room (lots of great tunes for dancing on the album). Right now I just don't see this one getting the same treatment. It seems a lot more rap-infused and that may be why I'm not liking it as much since that's not my favorite type of music. I'll pretty much only listen to it when it's heavily blended with other styles. So, while I don't hate this album, it's not my favorite Gorillaz album. It might grow on me over time. For the moment, though, it only gets an \\"it's okay\\" rating from me.
0790740443|5.0|Escape From New York was one of my first cable tv movie experiences as a boy, along with Arnold's Conan the Barbarian; and man these movies never lose their impact.    Another movie with a purpose, this movie demonstrates how a soldier is developed through different advancing stages, to that of a full blown killer.    Kurt Russell does a great service in this movie.     Thanks, Kurt.
B000002KDO|4.0|In the early 1970's the world was taken by storm by a new form of music, heavy metal. There were many bands in the heavy metal genre, but one that stood out was Black Sabbath. In 1971, they released their third album Master of Reality. This is by far my favorite album of Black Sabbath's. The musicianship of Iommi, Butler, and Ward is especially good. Ozzy's vocals are in great form on every track that requires vocals. My favorite songs on this album are Atfer Forever, Children of the Grave, and Into the Void.

Sledge. he says it all when he said \\"you dont know what it was like unless you fought in the battles, even the soldiers in rear areas a short distance away dont know\\".every student should read this book in school, then maybe when they grow up an become politicians they wont send our boys off to war.plan for the worst an hope for the best.

1423101499|4.0|I think that this book is the best in the Percy Jackson series. Rick Riordan really demostrates his knowledge for Greek mythology and uses it in a way young people can understand. This is a great book for almost any age!
B00003JRCQ|5.0|I saw Persuasion in the theater when it came out in 1995, I believe. I thought it was as good as Sense and Sensibility , even though the actors are not as well known. Excellent acting. If you are a Jane Austin fan, I highly recommend it.
1892005034|5.0|This book is an incredible manual of how to communication effectively. When applied properly, you can completely change anything from a simple conversation/disagreement to your entire life around.  I think everyone would do well to read this book.  In fact, teaching a class on it in school would be amazing.  Imagine a world where people knew how to express their feelings, needs and requests accurately and effectively: where fights and arguments were avoided because people who get their needs met and opinions aired more effectively.  This book is where that all starts.  Hope you enjoy it, I know I have!
B00008G7UF|5.0|Excellent acting by Kevin Kline and Meg Ryan.  Very entertaining! A must for every Francophile--great scenery.
B000WGWQG8|4.0|This series is absolutely brilliant. It loses a star because of some accuracy issues, but it revitalized my excitement for our Founding Fathers. A little slow for many audiences today, but anyone with the intellect to watch it and understand has much to gain for it.    On a separate note, this was the best service I've had from Amazon. Timely and in good condition. I give that five stars.
B002ZG97RE|4.0|Matt Damon stars in this Paul Greengrass movie as Chief Warrant Officer Miller, set in 2003, a unit tasked with finding Weapons of Mass Destruction. As the reader may recall, our President Bush led us to war in Iraq because their WMD's posed a major threat to America and the world.<br /><br />Matt Damon also stared in the Jason Bourne series by the same director. Miller and his team risk life and limb going into hot urban Iraqi war zone only to come up emptyhanded time after time. Miller starts to question the Intelligence which said these sites contained WMP's. He asked his commanders, the CIA and a Bush administration official to see the Intelligence reports or talk to the source who provided them.  Iraq locals like \\"Freddy\\" (believably played by Khalid Abdalla) help Miller and group, but he keeps in mind what he thinks is good for his country.<br /><br />There are plenty of fights, thrills and plenty of chases as this war movie/spy/mystery goes along. It held my attention to the end. If this wasn't shot in Baghdad, it certainly looks like it.<br /><br />Miller single-mindedly pursues his conclusions. This movie and its' motivation make a lot more sense than the Jason Bourne series, where characters were friends in one scene, enemies in another, then friends. This is a problem in many recent movies, for example \\"Sherlock Holmes\\". But not here. This plot makes sense!<br /><br />My biggest problem with this movie is Greengrass's use of hand held cameras and available light shooting. The camera work through the chase scenes where these are used is herky jerky and so bad it was making me nauseous. I finally removed my glasses and the softer focus made the chase scenes easier to watch. Also available light shooting at night places the camera in the digital noise range and the shots are full of blotchy blocks of color. Greengrass used the same jerky, choppy camera technique in the Bourne series, then shot with multiple cameras and excessive editting. deduct one star.<br /><br />Think of an America president committing American lives and treasure to war in Iraq, searching everywhere for weapons of mass destruction while ignoring the real threat to America, free market idealogs promoting credit default swaps that destroy the Wealth of Nations!<br /><br />Matt Damon does a great job, more coherent than Bourne. Worth seeing in a theater.dent committing American lives and treasure to war in Iraq, searching everywhere for weapons of mass destruction while ignoring the real threat to America, free market idealogs promoting credit default swaps that destroy the Wealth of Nations!

B0035J6TAI|5.0|Will be great to hear if any of the covered artists \\"Scratch Back.\\"  Paul Simon, David Bowie, Radiohead, Bon Iver, Lou Reed, David Byrne, Randy Newman, Neil Young...  I still get chills when Michael Stipe launches into an impromptu verse from PG's \\"Red Rain\\" during   \\"20 Time After Time Etc. [Live],\\" Good material for a wide range of voices and artistic interpretation.
B0035J6TA8|1.0|Absolutely the most depressing hour I have ever spent in my lifetime. It's bad enough that Gabriel is the slowest working musician in history, but after another lenghty 8 year wait, he gives us a collection of 12 songs that he didn't even have to write, and proceeds to turn each song into a convincing arguement for suicide. I will be shocked if this album is not banned when the authorities find this CD playing through headphones at the scene of thousands of suicide attempts. I don't know if I'll live long enough to hear the next Gabriel release in 202?, but just to be safe, I think I'll get rid of this one and try to forget the horror. THE HORROR!!!
B0001WTUH6|3.0|I may be mistaken but this version seems to be lacking the music that I remember from the theatrical version. The credits list about six songs. But I don't here anything but a little back round sound. Is this just my DVD? Some kind of manufacturing problem? I'm confused. Great movie though.

0786868724|5.0|This is a funny, thought provoking book that will make you savor each word. I totally enjoyed it.  As a person who is questioning her early beliefs, this book reassures that it is part of a person's growth process.
1905654294|5.0|I loved all of these books.  This is the last of the series, and I struggled between wanting to read it through and wanting to spread the enjoyment out longer.  Loved the ending!
0385504225|3.0|I am a huge Dan Brown fan. That said, this is not his best book. It's not terrible, but it's not great either. The pacing is fast, so it's an easy read. As always with Brown, you learn a lot of really interesting things along the way. But, sadly, it doesn't go anywhere. The big \\"secret\\" is a big dud. Still, it's entertaining enough to be worth reading. It's still better than a lot of the other crap out there. Just don't expect it to be as good as his others.
1439190275|5.0|Over the decade that I have been a vegetarian, my weight has ballooned.  About two weeks ago a friend who has been an avid Atkins follower told me that I could join her on Atkins. Now that I have read this book I realize why I couldn't lose weight before. I was eating so many \\"empty\\" carbs as bread, cereal, pasta, rice, potatoes, chips, and other snack foods plus lots and lots of fruit that I was never giving my body the chance to burn its own fat. In the two weeks that I have been following the vegetarian version of Atkins, I have already lost 5 pounds. Just as important, my constant hunger has disappeared. It sounds strange but I am actually eating more vegetables than I was before. It's good to know that I can feel good about what I eat and have my body feel good too.
B0000024W3|5.0|If I had to limit myself to only five Dylan albums to take with me to a desert island, they would be \\"Blonde on Blonde,\\" \\"New Morning,\\" \\"Blood on the Tracks,\\" \\"Bringing It All Back Home\\" (for the B side), and \\"Self Portrait.\\" While the first four are classics, \\"Self Portrait\\" is not. In fact, it has most often served as a can for pompous rock critics to kick around. Nevermind the naysayers, \\"Self Portrait\\" is an eclectic masterpiece. It comprises virtually all the sub-genres of American music:  Gospel and C&W, blues and folk, Appalachian ballads and sea shanties, pop and rollicking rock'n'roll.     And, throughout the album, Dylan exhibits much of his finest singing, on both his own songs and on his interpretations of songs by others. Non-Dylan fans will tell you that he's known for his lyrics, not his voice. However, dyed-in-the-wool Dylan fans know that it's really in his singing--in the nuances, in the rich palette of vocal hues and textures, and in the elongated vowels and punctuated consonants--where the magic lies. And no album presents as wide a spectrum of Dylan's vocal ingenuity as does \\"Self Portrait.\\"    \\"Alberta #1\\" lilts and leans, yearns and pleads. \\"Days of '49\\" is a sea shanty dressed in gold digger clothes; Dylan virtually becomes the forsaken, desperate miner, Tom Moore. Gordon Lightfoot's \\"Early Morning Rain\\" never did much for me. Nor did Peter, Paul, and Mary's famous cover. But Dylan shines new light on the song, saturating its lyrics with a fine mist. It glows under his sincere, intimate, gentle vocals.    \\"In Search of Little Sadie\\" is a re-write of the folk song \\"Little Sadie\\" (also on this album). And in it, Dylan stretches the phrases to the point of tearing them apart, raw and rocking. No music is more ragged and haggard than American folk music. Dylan knows this and exploits it better than anyone. He IS the wretched psychopath who shoots down little Sadie for no apparent reason. \\"Belle Isle\\" is a Celtic dream. You can see the fair maidenand feel the narrator's enamored pleas. \\"Gotta Travel On\\" is drenched in the blood of deep South gospel, strongly reminiscent of the Staple Singers, whom Dylan was evidently listening to a lot of at the time.    His rendition of Paul Simon's \\"The Boxer\\" has been panned by many a critic. However, give it a listen and tell me that it doesn't have more life than the original Simon & Garfunkel rendition. Just a bit unpolished, a bit dusty, and a bit tangled, Dylan (who harmonizes himself on this track) is a more believable fallen boxer than S&G. As far as poignant singing goes, \\"Copper Kettle\\" is gorgeous. Dylan, in country voice, sings as if he were a retired working class hero sitting in a cabin by the woodstove, contemplating the halcyon days of youth, taking pride in his Daddy's and Grandpa's clever way of getting around paying the whiskey tax.    \\"Self Portrait\\" is a rich fruit, sprung from the loins of American roots music. It is a multidimensional gem that synthesizes a spectrum of musical genres. The deeper one peers into it, the more one hears. The more one hears, the more one sees.
0786852550|3.0|Before I get into my review, I want to put out there that I enjoyed this book and would recommend for ages 15-22 MAX!    Pro's - There is some good action and page turning parts of the book. Especially the parts with Bartimaeus. I found myself wanting to see his name on the top of a chapter as I finished a Nathaniel chapter.  Bartimaeus was the most likable character in the book for me.  He was very cunning and nothing slipped by him.  Nathaniel was clever in his own way but was nothing without his Demon. The villain Lovelace is very easy to hate and is a formidable magician.  So your basic good guy bad guy theme is easy to get along with.    Con's- Well first off, I know Nathaniel is a 6 to 12 year old boy for the story, but does he really need to cry every chapter(except for about the last 5)?  I found myself loathing chapters with him learning lessons and getting screwed over all the time.  Someone already said it but the story did have a point where it dragged on just a little too much.  They could have cut out about 60 to 100 pages and just kept the action going.      So all in all it was a good read.  Just needed a tad bit more action and a little less baby emotion from the main character. I think if Nathaniel had been more strong mannered in the beginning of the book and not so fragile, people could relate and like him a bit better.  I am tentative to buy the second book because of some of the reviews on it, but I think I will finish the Trilogy and see how the other two are.
B000005JA8|4.0|This has to be what amounts to a true unique masterpiece. Albeit strange, and and at times downright bizarre, this album is undeniable in it's individuality and character. If you like Captain Beefheart, you will no doubt love this album. If you have even the slightest aversion to anything different, or anything out of the ordinary--this album is not for you. However, if your imagination is robust enough to envision something beyond the ordinary, something truly unique, buy this album and listen to it right away. Listen to it in one sitting! And then, think about what's important to you...and remember, you have to laugh in life--and laugh often!
1416594884|4.0|The conventional wisdom about this book seems to be 1) it's a somewhat halfhearted product of Le Carré's declining years or 2) it's an anti-American political tract pretending to be a novel.  I disagree with both points of view.  There are a number of interesting characters, and even though sorting out the crews representing various intelligence agencies (British, German, American) is a bit laborious, I still found Le Carré's exploration of these characters rewarding.  Many other reviews summarize the plot; I won't do that.   Dr. Abdullah is a spokesman of sorts for the Muslim world, who does 95% genuine good works and is said to blink at the 5% of evil that is done with his money.  He is an endearing character in many ways, but this may turn out to be a mask for more devious pursuits.  We still don't know, at the end of the book, whether he is 5% evil or not.  Issa, the son of a Russian Mafioso, has turned devout Chechen Muslim. He appears to be a stubborn idealist with a few loose screws, but may actually be a terrorist.  He hesitates to claim the inheritance left him by his father unless he can do \\"good\\" with it, and much of the book is devoted to ideologically maneuvering him into claiming this money.  Annabel is a human rights lawyer who wants to save Issa from almost certain deportation or death.  She believes that he is not a terrorist and has simply been caught in the all-too-indiscriminate dragnet of several governments pursuing terrorists after 9-11.  She may or may not be correct; again, we never know.  Tommy Brue is a Hamburg banker whose father set up a money-laundering account for Issa's father without Tommy's knowledge.  He has become emotionally involved with Annabel and Issa; their youthful idealism and willingness to sacrifice for the good appeals to him since he has lost his own.    Bachmann is a spy runner, a field expert who is constantly placed in the middle between liberal and conservative intelligence people and expected to do his job whilebalancing their expectations and agendas.  Yes, these people are \\"clichés\\" and yet I found Le Carré's portrayal of them to be rather vivid and memorable.  With great brevity he also brings to life a number of other \\"clichés\\" - the American woman from Langley who could have stepped right off the stage of Cabaret, the slithery British agent Ian Lantern.    I too took a look at Le Carré's website upon reading another review which uses the author's comments there to stab at this book.  I'd like to quote his comments on writing in their entirety:  \\"A good writer is an expert on nothing except himself, and on that subject, if he is wise, he holds his tongue.  Some of you may wonder why I am reluctant to submit to interviews...The answer is that nothing that I write is authentic.  It is the stuff of dreams, not reality.  Yet I am treated by the media as though I wrote espionage handbooks.  And to a point I am flattered that my fabulations are taken so seriously.  Yet I also despise myself in the fake role of guru, since it bears no relation to who I am or what I do.  Artists, in my experience, have very little centre.  They fake.  They are not the real thing.  They are spies.  I am no exception.\\"    Hurrah for Le Carré for having the guts to tell the truth!  Picasso once said something similar.  The artist's \\"fakery\\" is what convinces us that \\"reality\\" underpins his work.  This is not to say that books contain no truth at all.  Le Carré's point is that the artist is a spy and a faker, in his very nature - read some biographies of artists if you doubt him!  Very different from the biographies of gurus.  This book is like a mirror held up to the world that is 95% good and 5% evil - or perhaps 50-50.  Those who want morals and happy endings will be disappointed, those who want a political agenda may twist the mirror to find it, but they will all be wrong and Le Carré, like Issa and Abdullah, will vanish, fate unknown.  We will watch like Tommy and Bachmann knowing that there is not a thing that can be done.    I think it's a pretty good book!
1400052173|5.0|This was a very well told story about a family whose lives changed the medical history of the World. Ic ould not put this down. Skloot writes very fluidly and seamlessly and paints a vivid picture on the pages of this book. Before picking this up I had (no idea) that there was an immortal line of cells that changed history. This book made me cry for the people I was learning about, but I also laughed out loud. Very good book. Buy it now, really.
B0034GK7DM|5.0|He is the next George Strait...hands down.  I couldn't tell the difference between their voices on the radio...I seriously thought that it was King George...but it was King Corbin instead...can't wait til the world catches on.  20 years from now we'll all be listening to the \\"Easton Corbin 50 Number One Hits Disc Two\\"...no joke.  The way he sings, the words to the song, the way he carries a note, everything...just like George.  This boy is going to the TOP.
B000R7GKQE|5.0|i think it is as good as first season. keeps you hooked and makes you want to see more.
0756405890|5.0|I'm not much of a fan of the fantasy genre but caught this book on an off-hand referral, and after the first chapter was unable to put it down.   Beautiful language and well crafted storytelling.  I am now waiting not-so-patiently for the next book.
B000002B7O|5.0|This album is the best Ozzy album - period. I bought the other newest version that he remastered and it really sucked because he re-recorded the drums and maybe bass too. But it sucked and he remixed it so that the guitar was lost in the mix. I hated the new version because he basically ruined the complete listening experience - and all because he did not want to pay royalties to the drummer that worked on the original recording - which is horrible since the guy was partially responsible for helping Ozzy get so big with this album. I hate it when people do not want to give others credit for their work - bad Ozzy!    Anyway, I found this original recording with all the original sound and drums. It was hard to find - in fact, Amazon was the ONLY place this was available and I searched everywhere. (Thanks Amazon) It was worth every penny and I am glad I was able to find this great masterpiece of work still around somewhere.
