B007MG360G|5.0|The Grand kids really enjoy this game. Keeps them entertained. I don't understand the game but if they enjoy it that good enough for me. I like to keep them happy.
B0098VYCCE|1.0|I expected to be entertained. Instead, I was bored to death!!! I love fantasy and horror, not horrible. The plot was scattered. The acting awful.
B007UPNA6Y|4.0|Some have commented that they have been disappointed with A Wanted Man. How can you be disappointed with a Reacher book? I've read them all and this book is essentially like any other Reacher story. This is what we wanted from him - it's a franchise and we don't want him to change, do we?<br /><br />Here's the plot: Reacher is wandering around aimlessly across small town America. Somebody Crosses the Line. Then Reacher must maim and kill those who Crossed the Line. Sound familiar?<br /><br />This book delivers exactly the same elements as any other Reacher story. It's sometimes absurd but always engaging. Some reviewers have talked about repetition and complained about the writing, as if Lee Child was on autopilot. I actually found the writing to be more effective than in some earlier novels. He's taking the matter-of-fact style so far that it's almost comical, but in an enjoyable way.<br /><br />If you haven't read other Reacher novels this is just as good as any other to start with.
0345803485|5.0|These books are great, I read all three books, could not put them down, I love the characters christian and ana are so real just cant get enough heard ther making this trilogy , a movie, can't wait
B0098VXE50|3.0|Too dark and violent .  The acting was good, but Snow White was not \\"pretty enough<br />perhaps another actress would have been better.
B008MG1E4A|2.0|The look from the inside is interesting and I doubt any military intelligence secrets were given away. However, I found this book dull and uninteresting for a more basic reason: the author does not write prose very well. My mind wandered as I read this, and I thought perhaps it was meant for somebody with a fourth grade education. Timely? Yes. A good read? No.
0525953728|4.0|\\"No Easy Day\\" gives a good description of life as an American fighting man. Our Special Forces deserve way more credit for what they do to keep us safe. But that's one of the things that make them so special. They don't want the credit; they just want to accomplish the mission and get back home. They're not Rambo or Superman or the mighty Hulk. They're men with families wondering how they're going to pay for their kids braces or if they'll be back in time for graduation.<br /><br />This was a well written depiction of life as a Navy SEAL. The mission to capture or kill Osama bin Laden was just another mission in a long career of service to our country and was presented as such.<br /><br />My sincere thanks to the author and to the members of our Armed Forces for their service.<br />The words spoken only in whispers by the timid shall forever be brandished by the brave....Duty, Honor, Country.<br />Well done boys! Get Some!
B009LZEZSI|4.0|I had been debating with myself whether I should keep watching GLEE this season because there didn't seem to be any continuity in the past three episodes.  They all seemed rather helter skelter.  Finally, we get to episode 4, \\"Break-Ups\\", and I now see this was the episode that determines where the rest of the season goes.  The couples needed to break up or take a break from each other in order to establish a new path for GLEE.  The old group is never going to be the same and that's alright.  The new path is now established and I am anxious to see where it takes the show from here on out.  I thought the musical numbers in this episode were also the best of the season.  They were full of emotions which made them sound very powerful and rich.  Let's hope there will be more episodes as great as this one as the season progresses.
B005EGXTEE|4.0|I really enjoyed the first book, it was very much like the movie. The next two books were easy reading and somewhat predictable but a good read.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|I read it slow and wanted it to last.  Sadly I came to the end.  Follet has never disappointed.  Another great tale.  I look forward to the third installment.
B008JDAC7G|5.0|It's like a more fast paced Jenga mixed with Puyo Pop Fever. It's easy to pick up but hard to master &amp; I really enjoy it :3
B007GCY8FS|5.0|Classic Reacher. You can't go wrong with Jack. As usual, he is in a impossible situation but wins out be he is the baddest mother in the valley.
B005MMZLEQ|2.0|Horrible casting of King Arthur. No wonder the show was canceled. Once Upon a Time is a thousand times better.
B0070NSPCU|5.0|This is an \\"out of the box\\" fantasy, well-written, with interesting characters.  Its plot line takes more than a few twists and turns.  I am very much looking forward to the next installment.
B008K6HN8I|5.0|I had around one megabits of internal memtoy left because of gameloft games and I didn't know how to get rid of he internal storage part in this ap it lets u see what is all on your kindle and I freed up over 2gigs of space thanks
B00846REIS|3.0|I read 50 shades first then I read this for a book club an I just felt that tho had not substance And was less mushy than 50 shades was, I enjoyed this book but was unrealistic in spots and interesting parts kind of started then fell off and was never discussed again
B001AQR3JY|4.0|Great DVD, the delivery time was quick. we recieved our package in 2 days after ording the DVD.  The only con I have was the DVD was clearly the first one ever made for this movie.  The coloring was not the best, or neither was it as clear as new movies are today, but to a three year old it was perfect.
B006TAJ9WU|3.0|I'm a big man with a size 13 shoe... I returned my CROCS because they were too long and too wide.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|Book number two picked up right where one left off. The writing and story is great with fictional and non-fictional events expertly blended.
159420229X|5.0|I really enjoyed this book. I went in thinking it would be a dry how-to book but it turned out being an easy flowing read. One of the most interesting books I've read, I was amazed at all the things dealing with memory that I never knew about. After reading I memorized all the presidents in order in less than an hour, now I've decided use some the mnemonic techniques to help me learn Spanish. I would highly recommend this book to everyone, whether you want to improve your memory or otherwise.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|This book was great. Once I started reading I couldn't put the it down. The whole 50 shades trilogy is a must read, you can't just stop with the first book.
B007IXWKUK|1.0|I am glad that I didnt pay full price for this book. dont waste your time. EL James should have concentrated on writing one good book instead of three mediocre books.
B009329Y30|5.0|This film has a great plot and is very well converted onto the screen it show both protagonist and antagonist are just imperfect people trying to live there lives and when called upon even the antagonist does the right thing.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|This second book continues on with the same style, excitement, and stimulation as Book 1, keeping me spellbound by it's content and not wanting to put it down!  I highly recommend this book and the entire trilogy to all women.
0553801473|2.0|Some of the important characters have been omitted, and especially the story of Jon and Danaeris are too dragged out and boring. Some characters changed their personality completely and went from smart and cunning to complete idiots. I hope the next installment will be the page-turner that the others were. Come on, George, get with the program. I don't like to be bored.<br />CAT
B0087HT36U|4.0|Think Angry Birds with a castle twist.  The game is colorful and fun to play.  I would recommend it to my friends.
B0091REZMW|5.0|I play this game all the time on my ipad and was glad to see its now on the kindle. very addicting
B004SBS8LA|4.0|Had a blast trying to free the birds from their cages. Would recommend for all ages. starts off easy but gets some what difficult. Fun!
B007D2XSW0|5.0|this app sure does edit the pictures in a which and easy manner that makes them look awesome. surely a must havr
B000FBJHEO|1.0|I did not like the movie, and did not like the book. Sorry. I think he does not need to use so many metaphors to express ideas that can be perfectly understood if just directly expressed.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I am not an avid reader, but reading this book with the easy to read writing style of the author made me want to read more. I have finished it in record time and have moved on to the second book in the trilogy. Loved it.:-):-):-)
B006ZDS7CE|5.0|This is a truly amazing album. Lana's sound is so original! I LOVE IT. I've been listening to the entire album on repeat for the past two weeks!
B000FCKRDI|1.0|The beginning of this story was great...I loved the storyline and it kept me entertained but somewhere in the middle it got really boring and predictable. I didn't finish reading it.
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|I was hesitant to read this book because the characters were college age and I thought it would be boring. Anything but!! I couldn't put it down. I can't wait for walking disaster to be released!
B008FSCNTK|5.0|I listened to it on USA TODAY and I really enjoyed it.  It did have a different sound then some of her other work.
B007GCY8FS|3.0|Not as edge of the seat \\"reacher\\",I have read them all .this was flat not the fast paced heart in mouth as prior reacher novels
B006LSZECO|5.0|This is an entertaining read.  I really enjoyed the style and plot twists. It keeps you guessing all along the way.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|A lot has been said about the former U.S. Navy Seal, who wrote this book,  He in no way betrayed the security in which the Nvy Seals operate.  It was insightful, showing the frustration these brave men faced waiting for word from the administration to approve of the mission.  I enjoyed it very much.
B008AX18Y6|4.0|Better than a lot of acclaimed stuff I have read... Very interesting, in fact unputdownable. The beauty of the memoir is its refreshing honesty, down to the last detail.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|I'm an Army Infantry vet, so I'm biased. None the less, this is a great read about a good guy who put his ass on the line to doing a job that few would do, even if they were physically able. Kudos to Chris. Welcome home, job well done.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|I was hooked by the 2nd paragraph!  I thought I might have to go back and skim the first book in the series in order to remember, but not so.  Ken Follett has done an incredible job bringing the reader up to speed without a lot of reminding.  He is one of my favorite all-time writers.
B007FEFLTO|3.0|NOT AS GOOD AS THE FIRST OF THE TRILOGY.<br />IT APPEARS THAT THIS BOOK WAS RUSHED THROUGH TO MEET<br />THE DEMAND CAUSED BY THE VERY GOOD FIRST BOOK.
B008XG1X18|5.0|What a great site! Everytime I check it out I find something new,  inspiring,  funny or just plain bizarre. I've tried a number of projects from the site with varying results but it is always a hoot.
B0097GVJWQ|4.0|This was a fun game, a little too much having to go from place to place over and over though.  Nice graphics for the most part.
B008MG1E4A|2.0|Poorly written, no flow, and no real story.  After all the hype I was very disappointed in this book. It was not a good account of what special forces do--too disconnected.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|As usual Stephen King does not disappoint with his story telling ability.  Filled with a bunch of \\"what if's\\" concerning changing the past to change the future and finding the results not always pleasant, the ripple effects caused by the slightest or most seemingly insignificant action are creative and thought provoking.  The descriptions of life in that bygone era and the personalities of the principals in the story are exceptional.  This was a very enjoyable read and I found it hard to put down.  Congratulations to the author!
B005DC68NI|5.0|The book has three sections: The Digital Revolution; Digital Self-Publishing; and Success Stories. Each section can stand on it's own; combined, Let's Get Digital is a useful and inspiring book. No hype, no BS like certain other people who've written about their alleged sf-publishing successes - just good, cogent analysis of the publishing industry and where it appears to be headed + How to self-publish intelligently so as to attract readers/your tribe + ending with 33 real life & ongoing success stories.<br /><br />Another valuable thing about Mr. Gaughran's book for me is that a European wrote it. He is successfully experiencing the same shift and opportunities for self-publishing success as are many Americans that come to mind. And he has a section on the international market.<br /><br />Can't go wrong if you buy this book.
B008IJT0CE|4.0|I listen to this when I'm using my kindle fire. Very relaxing! You can add or delete any sounds at one time.
0525953728|5.0|As a veteran myself (Vietnam) I can R E A L L Y identify with the writer.  I wasn't a Seal, I wasn't a Green Beret, but I did have Very specialized training and did perform specific functions for the military. I can get into all the parts of this narrative as only a vet can and will be forever greatful for the sacrifices that these very special men did.  The reading was easy, fast and very understandable and at times immersed the reader into the action.  I highly recommend this book.<br /><br />Jon M
B001BKVWYG|5.0|Sixto Rodriguez is a fabulous singer / songwriter / musician from the 60's and 70's who was largely overlooked in the United States. He has been the subject of numerous but inaccurate rumors related to his death; however he is still alive and playing his hits most recently on the Late Show with David Letterman and is the subject of the film biography \\"Finding Sugarman\\".<br />His music has recently been recognized and this album, Cold Fact: [[ASIN:B001BKVWYG Cold Fact]], has been re-released and is a fantastic album.  This is a must have album for any person that appreciate original music and thought provoking lyrics.  Once you have this album it is also recommended that you listen to and purchase his follow up album Coming From Reality: [[ASIN:B001TCHDPS Coming from Reality]] which has also been re-released.
B001383XT8|2.0|We compared this pedal with a Metal Zone by Boss using the same power supply (9v Dunlop) and this one was pretty noisy and had a lot of feadback in any position (regarding the position of the guitar and the amplifier). Maybe it would not produce undesire noise using batteries... It doesn't sound that great, but the price is unbeatable!!
B0087JTAKW|4.0|Very enjoyable read.  The unique format held my attention throughout .  Sad to think that as the most evolved citizens on earth, we continue to allow time to dictate our every moment.  Definitely a thought provoking book.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|This book contains alot of erotic sexual content...it's definitely not for the prudish.  It did not really get a 'plot' until later in the book.  It did end; however, having me want more.  I am now on the 2nd book of the trilogy.
B006TJXZ30|5.0|The movie was very educational for our young people who have no idea what our foreparents went through in order to succeed.  Parents should take advantage of the the opportunity to educate the children.
B006LSZECO|1.0|I had high hopes for this as my friend  really liked it but I don't like reading about what mentally sick people do to others.
B0079J28NW|5.0|They really have done a good job on this release.<br />The picture quality is incredible.<br />Packaging is great.<br />Menus are different to the old DVD release, but the extras are the same.<br />Brilliant!
B0097EWK3A|5.0|This is a casual game done right. Exellent graphics, good music and atmosphere,  engaging story, and cool puzzles. There were a few cheesy &quot;scares&quot; that you saw coming a mile away, but that just made it fun. Definately worth it!
B007GCY8FS|5.0|The book was great as usual for the Reacher series.  I hear a movie is coming out with Jack Reacher being played by Tom Cruise.  Yah!
B0025UHKNS|1.0|I purchased the Garmin Forerunner 405 as an &#34;upgrade&#34; to Forerunner 305.  Big mistake.  I was generally pleased with the 305 but wanted something a little more sleek and less bulky and to that end the 405 meets expectations.  I was also able to obtain a satellite signal more rapidly with the 405.  But that's all there is in terms of upside.<br /><br />In exchange for those minor advantages you have to deal with the flawed design of the &#34;bezel&#34;.  It is an absolute nightmare to use while exercising since the moisture from perspiration interferes with it.  I use the device primarily for running, cycling and mountain biking.  Many times I use a heart rate monitor that - on a positive note - pairs very well with the Forerunner.  However, in order to switch screens to see your heart rate or review any data you need to use the bezel.  I don't believe I perspire any more than average (in fact I bet less than the average guy) but any moisture whatsoever interferes with the bezel.  It is extremely frustrating.  For those of you that run with the iPod Nano and try to change songs once you've started sweating it is a very similar issue.  I have tried running with a towel to try to keep my one hand dry but it provided only a slight improvement.<br /><br />What struck me was that I was allowing a device that is supposed to assist me in exercising actually negatively affect my workouts.  Instead of considering another GPS watch device I have since changed my philosophy.  I now run with my smartphone and use one of the GPS apps I've downloaded.  The best ones in my opinion are Cyclemeter and SportsTracker.  They provide comparable data that you get from Garmin's website (in fact what you get on your phone is more than what Garmin shows on the device itself.)  I never have to worry about taking my device as I always have my phone with me.  Since the app is intergrated into the phone I get all the updates, i.e. speed, pace distance, through my earbuds with no need tolook at my phone.  And I believe both are either free or cost $2 or $3 to download.  The added bonus is that I no longer use the iPod Nano as my iPhone has all the music I need.  In short, ditch the watch and use your smartphone.  It's better, easier and significantly CHEAPER!
B002MQYOFW|1.0|I said it in my Title.  I had heard this was supposed to be the most wonderful series since \\" Harry Potter\\". It is NOT! I am thoroughly disgusted by the degree of sickening violence that this Author has chosen to present to young and a younger reading audience. I am certainly glad that I didn't bother with the film! To those who so loudly touted this book as great...you need serious mental help. This book was SICK.
B004AM5QT4|4.0|Considering Follett's other masterpieces it  was easy to figure the ending. Easy reading, nothing to challenge your mind though. Loved Pillars of the Earth, World without End, and will read Winter World next.  Looking forward to it. Still think the author is one of the best
B008TRUDAS|5.0|Just a great book about life, love, family, and struggles.  You would not regret reading it...I was sad when it was over and couldnt wait to start the follow up.
B008K6HN8I|5.0|This app has made storage and retrieval of my favorite files so much better.  I keep dozens of knitting patterns on my Kindle Fire, and now I can find anything.  Love it!!
B0086DBE62|4.0|Julia Roberts was, as always, the best.  The movie was not as good. It was not what a young child would understand.  More for adults and young adults.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|great time killer!  loads of fun... makes you want to keep playing when you collect puzzle pieces to see what's going to be next!
B004SOR4H6|5.0|Really like this app.  Works much better than on windows!  It is easy to connect with other Twitters and internet sights.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|I thought the first book was just ok........totally stealing premise from shades of grey. However, this second book had much more of a story line. I really enjoyed it.
B0032CVAQQ|3.0|Chapman explains how we can live and love together yet not understand that we don't connect on the same wavelength. By observing that some people touch, others use words, gifts, time, or actions to express devotion the recipient may only receive a different language. It has helped me understand how my girlfriend enjoys having time together but does not value gifts.
B004RZGUBM|5.0|A great way to read a great classic..  Everybody should read Dickens.  Oliver Twist will keep you at the edge of your seat. David Copperfield is a must read.
B008KW43TE|5.0|I was really shocked...I bought this album after the MTV awards...I thought ot was sometging for the teens, but he is a really talented young man...voice reminds me a little of prince...and he has the creativity of Eryka Badu...mix with a little Cee Lo...lol...it was great lyrical album..
B007FEFLTO|2.0|Not much dramatic interest in this one. Characters are more wood than flesh and blood. I counted at least nine coincidences and that's at least six too many.
B0076NKNLA|4.0|Great acting. I actually forgot for a moment that it was Michelle Williams and not actually Marilyn Monroe acting in this movie.
1451673442|5.0|This book really has the power to change one's life, if the principles are applied.<br /><br />It creates an atmosphere for you that is far better than the one you now have. There are different chapters with things to do which will change your ways of thinking, and if followed, it will surely bring a great positive turnabout in your life.<br /><br />The chapters bring you wisdom, discipline, and the ability to be grateful for all that you now have. Following the practice which is not difficult will bring you into a happy, and orderly life.<br /><br />I have only read the first few chapters, and plan on continuing the practices given here. I think so much of the book, purchased at Amazon, that I plan on giving it away to my two daughters.<br /><br />Thank you for reading this.
B003QTWR08|4.0|It's just one of my favorite movies period! Extremely cute, funny and a great message!! Great for kids and adults
B000KJT8IG|5.0|Probably one of the best Christmas movies every made.  This movie should be up there for your holiday viewing right along with the greats like White Christmas and A Christmas Story.  The movie stand up to the passing of time and even though the in laws are a little extreme, I'm sure you'll see bits and pieces of your own family and remember so crazy holiday meals you've spent with them.
B007GCY8FS|5.0|i only need to know the character is Jack Reacher to want to read it!  Always thinking several steps ahead of most nortals, he relies more on his brain than his intimidating size.
B001GMH8TM|3.0|I remember watching this movie many years ago and it really moved me.  A guy in an imaginary world, that's totally real to him, and then everything falls apart and he questions his own existence. After buying it on Blu Ray and watching it again so many years later, the story didn't seem to move me like before and was just ok...
B007FEFLTO|5.0|Ken Follett's second of three books (twentieth century trilogy) illustrated why he is the master of case studies with historical correctness  The families featured represent realistic pathos and lifestyle that so possessed the first half of the 20th Century. This is a read that must not be missed!
0525953728|5.0|I really enjoyed reading and learned a lot about special forces in this book.<br /><br />I also enjoyed looking at many of the reviews who gave it \\"1 star.\\"  What I found:<br />  1.  some must have confused 1 & 5 stars, as they liked the book<br />  2.  many were more interested in bashing the author than reviewing the book<br />  3.  some never even started or finished reading the book--some admitted, others I could tell by what they said<br />  4.  some said they learned nothing new - could be they already were well trained or well read on this topic<br />  5.  some were over-sensitive to several remarks that were slightly political<br />  (liberals always speak with reverence for our President, unless he's a Republican)<br />  6.  some labeled the book as revealing secrets and putting troops in danger--Notice they only threatened to arrest<br />  for disclosure, one month later, NOTHING, because the book gives away nothing<br /><br />What is appalling is that those in our military lose rights that the rest of us enjoy because of them.  Those who claim he is just patting himself on the back lack objectivity.  He made me more aware and appreciative of the sacrifices all our special forces and their families endure.  I am the proud mother of 3 who have served in our military.
1455844217|5.0|Great audio book! Loved the narrator. Plan to read the book to my students. A book for all ages. Kudos to the author.
B007GCY8FS|5.0|I have read all of the series on Jack Reacher published by Lee Child and strongly recommend them to anyone who enjoys action tales.<br /><br />Reacher encounters the FBI, NSA, and the State Department in Wanted Man.  Al Qaeda needs fund so they divert to selling shares by the gallon to flush their funds.  Reacher becomes the wanted man in the search to end the practice.  Interesting concept.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|Ken Follett's second part of the trilogy is a great read and continues the history of the same characters through the second world war.We will await the third episode.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|regen takes a while in the lower levels but as you get higher you get more coins to use without paying
B007GCY8FS|4.0|A little slower pace than the normal Jack Reacher persona. Maybe he's getting older, but he's still Jack. Still a must read if a Reacher fan
B0098VYCCE|3.0|Maybe because I didn't have the whole affect of being in a theatre ornhaving an HD TV but Inthought this movie was boring. Effects were cool but that's about it.
B007GCY8FS|4.0|Lee Child is one of my favorite authors, however some of his books are better than others.  I would rank \\"A Wanted Man\\"  somewhere in the middle: a readable book that isn't as good as some by this author.
B005LAIHRC|5.0|this review is on the blu ray disc of the movie -<br />movie- 5 / 5<br />video- 5 / 5<br />audio- 5 / 5<br />THIS MOVIE ON BLU RAY SIMPLY ROCKS - BIG TIME!<br /><br />THE BLU RAY IS SHARP AND CLEAN THROUGHOUT, WITH BOTH THE VIDEO AND AUDIO RATING 5+.<br />SIMPLY PUT - ONE OF MY BEST BLU RAY BUYS EVER.<br />WATCH THE EXTENDED VERSION, AND EVEN IF THE STORYLINE IS A LITTLE HOKEY-POKEY AT<br />TIMES, WITH SOME ADULT CONTENT , AND I GUARANTEE YOU'LL LOVE IT AS MUCH AS I DID.<br />GOT THE BLU RAY YESTERDAY, AND HAVE ALREADY WATCHED THE EXTENDED VERSION ( 2 HRS+ )<br />TWICE AND WILL DEFINITELY BE WATCHING IT AGAIN SEVERAL TIMES MORE IN THE NEAR FUTURE.<br />SOUNDTRACK IS TO DIE FOR WITH ALL THE BEST RETRO SONGS INCLUDED AND TOM CRUISE REALLY<br />IS A KING OF ROCK WITH HIS MARVELOUS PERFORMANCE.<br />HE WOULD HAVE MADE A GREAT ROCKSTAR.<br />JUST REMEMBER TO CRANK UP YOUR HOME THEATER SYSTEM TO THE MAX FOR THE MOST ROCKING<br />MUSIC I'VE HEARD IN A MOVIE FOR QUITE A WHILE.<br />SO IN CLOSING, GO GET THE BLU RAY FOR YOUR COLLECTION!<br /><br />ROCK ON.......
B007VUA7VO|5.0|This app works great and is very informative.  It tells me what I need to know and then some.  Highly recommend.
B007UPNA6Y|5.0|I have read all the Jack Reacher stories published till now.<br />This one is like the rest: A very good read, and a few hour of top entertainment.<br />Recommended!
0316228532|1.0|Before give my opinion I want to tell you I think J. K. Rowling is one of the most talented writers I have ever read. As an individual, she has gone through incredible trials. I love that she has generously given back to organizations worldwide. She has encouraged children to read and stands up for the rights of those who have been abused throughout the world. She is an amazing person.<br /><br />I was thrilled to receive this book as a gift. I had been looking forward to its release for months and couldn't wait to see what she had dreamed up next. Early on in the story, I was having the hardest time relating to any of the characters and had a difficult time keeping all of them straight. I was already disappointed about the number of F bombs she had dropped but was hoping it was going to be restricted to one or two characters in the story. So I began doing what I never do...I skimmed the rest of the book. I was hoping to find something redeeming, but what I found instead was an incredibly crass and ugly world where no one really seems to genuinely care for anyone other than themselves. Amidst the remainder of the book there was drug use, sex, rape, prostitution, suicide, self-mutilation & pedophilia. I sincerely hope she wasn't basing these characters on anyone she knows. I  know not everyone will feel the way I do about this book, and they are certainly entitled to their opinions, but I feel that J. K. Rowling was doing everything in her power to shake off her previous image as a children's author. Another reviewer likened it to a successful child actor posing for a smut magazine. I wholeheartedly agree. She seemed like she had something to prove and went so over the top that it was impossible to see whatever point she had hoped to make in her story, political or otherwise. In all fairness, she did warn readers that this was an \\"adult book\\". But even though I am an adult it was way too much for me. I was disgusted and sadly disappointed.
B006BAEQB2|5.0|I don't think Gregory has written a novel I have not liked.  I always appreciate her research and she has inspired me to do some on my own.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|its awesome o use it to know how much tome I have to spend on the Internet it tells you everything
B004HD61KE|3.0|This book was a good read. Interesting storyline, good characters. Just wish there was a little more historical info included in the storyline.
B0098VXCR0|4.0|Special effects were great....Charlize is terrific as usual...<br />Kristen Stewart is another Mathew Broderick...It's the same emotion no matter what role they play
B007IXWL2C|1.0|Such cringe worthy text. sheer crap, but got addicted to the two previous books. So glad this is the last book. Still have not figured out why these books have made the \\"big time \\" and other smut, usually better didn't get anywhere.??
B0086700CM|5.0|when I got this game I couldn't put it down I've never had it crash and love the idea of it thanks Imangi studios
B007GCY8FS|3.0|I love Jack Reacher (not Tom Cruise) but this novel was lacking.  A lot of filler and not much substance.  Let's get back to stories more like the early books where the suspense was there...  I'll still buy the next book, but I'm beginning to lose my enthusiasm.
B001GMQALY|4.0|It was a pretty good movie. Loved both stars in later movies, thought I would watch this one, had never heard of it before Amazon. If you like Kim Basinger or Mickey Rourke, you will like 9 1/2 Weeks.
B007VUA7VO|4.0|Very useful. Some settings are a little tricky but overall this is easy to use, simple, functions well, and I love that it automatically opens when I plug in my Kindle Fire. Very good app. :D
B008Y1RTUG|2.0|Charlize was great. She brought back memories of my phyco b**** from hell stepmother. That was worth a star. The story is a good one, the eye candy was ok too.... But Kristen's inability to act was a huge downfall. It's like she struggles to convey emotion with her face.... So not worth it
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|This game is great for all ages.  This is a Great game.  I really like it. I just want to keep getting more coins.
B00846REIS|5.0|This book is awesome I was hooked on every word of it. I couldn't wait for the 2nd book to come out so I could find out me.
B008RV5K5E|5.0|To all the folks giving this a bad review because its a  cartoon rather than the last Batman movie, did you ever try reading the description of the product ???? Amazon aren't ripping anyone off. They are just giving us the chance to see the animated version of Millers Graphic novel. Like when you go and buy a pair of shoes , try it on and READ the description before whining, please :)
B0085A9HXS|3.0|This was a fun and exciting movie, the action is entertaining and the plot is good enough that it doesn't get in the way of what the movie really offers: violence. Anyone who likes action, especially martial arts, will probably want to see this movie. Whether you rent/borrow or buy depends a bit on you and I will offer my opinion on which you should do.<br /><br />Plot/realism are a big deal to you: don't buy this movie. If you're going to spend the whole time stressing over the plot then it will probably spoil it for you. You should probably rent it and who knows, if you really like it you can still easily buy it and you're only one dollar down.<br /><br />Uncomfortable around violence: if broken bones, explosions, knife wounds, and s excessive bleeding make you queasy you should probably pass on this film. It's pretty gory.<br /><br />Looking for 100 minutes of action and suspense: this movie is for you. Definitely watch it, and if you like martial arts you should probably just buy it.<br /><br />Can't read your native language and don't speak Indonesian (or whatever this language is): This is a foreign film, so obviously it's in a foreign language. I watched this movie with subtitles, I'm sure there is an English dubbed version but I'm unsure if it's on this DVD or not. To me the subtitles were just fine and I hardly thought about the fact that I was reading the words. I this bothers you, dont watch this movie.<br /><br />Cons: Basically the acting is good enough (hard to tell when they're speaking a different language) but there are a few places where it's a bit rough. the plot is just OK (but really weak if you think about it). I was misled when I went into this movie, I read it was about \\"elite\\" cops doing a raid. You find out right away they are a rookie squad. This confused me and disappointed me just a little but it wasn't a huge deal.<br /><br />Pros: this movie is really rather simple, but it does a lot of simple things really well. The music is great, really fits the moods. The martial arts choreography is exciting and fun to watch. The suspense is well done and the bad guy is really great.<br /><br />Overall the movie is worth a watch.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|It's about time a hot steamy sex novel is geared to the woman in the relationship!  Too bad it took a man to write it.  I think this is indicative of how much we needed this novel to be written.
B006FO3ERQ|3.0|This book was recommended to me by an avid reader. I value this person's literary opinion.<br />So I bought it.<br /><br />The book was just ok.  Not good or great but just ok.  My age is that of the story teller and<br />helped me identify with the historical time the book was written.  Truthfully, I found the<br />story eerie. I knew kids and families like those in the story and hadn't really thought about<br />those acquaintances for half a century.<br /><br />Canada left me wanting more.  Of what I am not sure.<br />My comments may be too harsh but they are my honest reflection of the whole book.
B009GEOLM4|1.0|This movie misrepresents itself with the title, the cover and the year. Amazon should be ashamed at this rip off of my $5 to watch 30 seconds of a cartoon before realizing I had been dooped.
B0089ZEEYG|4.0|I really enjoy passing the time with this game. Great fun for any age. My 12yrold nephew had a blast playing it.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I love this app it goes everywhere with me!! its insperation to me it also has killer food that I cook at least one a week thank you it rocks
B003TNM2ME|5.0|A very well acted, well produced and riviting movie based on Stephen King's best - selling book. The movie has all you look for in a \\"Stephen King\\" book, suspense, chills, quite a few laughs and a twist at the end that you don't see coming. A very good novel turned movie that really does some justice to the book. I'm glad I bought the movie.
B002RV01Q8|4.0|the very best of enya contains 1 cd and 1 dvd  so you get a  few music videos of the singers lovely voice though if you dont need the visual or  want to see the dvd to often there is the cd  with the songs  and the c has more songs
B007THA4FI|1.0|This book started slow, but by the middle you actually think it was faster on the beginning.  Hope the publishers get sued out of business by the justice department, for price fixing.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|this game is so much fun. it reminds me of the boardwalk arcades when I was a kid. a fun way to pass the time.
B007SGM084|5.0|I got the bundle which was a better deal. I am so glad I did . This is a book you just can't put down
B0063IH60K|5.0|This game is challenging in that all it takes is one wrong choice, and your game is no longer 'win'-able. You can always replay the deal and try again.
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|It took me awhile to warm up to this book but once I did, I couldn't put it down. Travis is extremely hard to tolerate until the reader figures out what he is all about. Even Abby is, at times, hard to tolerate. However, it does become clear the feelings and emotions these two star crossed lovers have for each other. Even though they do their best to stay away from each other it is obvious to the reader that the winds of fate means to bring them together under any circumstances. They need each other and eventually realize it. There were times when I laughed and times when I cried as well. Their love for each other is so extreme that the readers emotions will run the gambit. I loved this book very much and look forward to the sequel.
B005OP7162|5.0|I was surprised how much I enjoyed this series. I don't watch a lot of series but certainly got drawn into this. I even downloaded Izler music! So, I would recommend this because it drew me in and kept enough twist and turns to make me look forward to next episode.
B008AX18Y6|5.0|I have never actually finished any of Rushdies books before. I found them too obscure or just difficult to understand. This one is different. I just couldn't stop reading. I bought the Kindle-version, so I have acces to the dictionary just by pressing on the word I don't recognize. I definitely recommend it!
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I enjoy this game because of the planning you make your mind do to get it right! Thanks for the app!
B007GCY8FS|5.0|JACK REACHER CONTINUES TO SUCK YOU INTO HIS WORLD.<br />HE IS TRULY A HERO WITHOUT NEEDING TO HAVE COMPENSATION FOR HIS EFFORTS.  A FUN READ
B00884GR0W|2.0|Glitchy, not an attention grabber, GUI needs some work and not updated enough. Keep working on it. It could be huge 1 day.
0345803485|2.0|So, I succumbed kicking and screaming (well, at least protesting wholeheartedly) to the \\"Oh my god, you have got to read this book.\\" This isn't exactly my normal foray into the world of \\"literature,\\" and that term I use rather loosely. Let's just say, after finishing this year's must read, I felt, well, rather dirty, sort of like I had been stumbled upon while watching internet porn. No offense to those who enjoyed this read, but as for me, maybe I am too old fashioned, not schooled enough in BDSM, or hell, maybe just a sucker for a regular steamy romance novel. This wasn't it and to think they are going to make this into a movie. What, a porn??? That being said, I am off to take yet another shower, out damn spot, out...
B00992CF6W|5.0|you need to put in servers but other than that awesome game<br />the server would be like the one on the computer<br />l
0439023521|5.0|I am a sucker for a strong female protagonist. Enter Katniss and already Suzanne Collins has scored a home run. You don't just end up rooting for Kat, but become so emotionally invested that you want to climb into the pages and protect her on one hand, while on the other you know she needs no protecting. I devoured this book feverishly, my lower lip gnawed to bits as the sun rose and fell, and still I kept reading. Yes, this book is that good, in all its dystopian darkness. So, I ask again, am I too old at the age of 34 to want to be just like Katniss when I grow up? Hell no...
B007VUCAVO|5.0|This app is well worth the money! Works great and has awesome breakdown allowing you to see what is using most power!
B009GEBBNQ|5.0|A wild ride, well worth the price of admission.  Joss Whedon spun a great film and did right by these characters.  Grab some popcorn, turn up the volume, and enjoy the rush!
B002N5N4M6|5.0|We purchased the first, second and now the third BIG BANG THEORY seasons.<br />Can't wait to buy seasons 4 & 5 !  This is great family entertainment!<br />We just love the kids !
B006LSZECO|3.0|I was disappointed because it was very predictable.It was a book I was able to put down! This book didn't keep my interest like most books recommended by other readers.
B00932A2MC|3.0|We really enjoy Liam Neeson movies.  This movie is not great but not totally disappointing.  It was worth the $3.99 for a 24 hour HD rental.  Watched it twice and enjoyed it both times.
B007GCY8FS|2.0|First off, i am a big fan of Lee Child, really enjoy reading his books, and really like his character, Reacher...<br /><br />I expected this book to be on par with his previous works, and was sadly disappointed...<br /><br />This one just didn't have the pop of the others, far more subdued, less action, fewer bad guy \\"tune ups\\" by Reacher.<br /><br />I am not sure how long Child can keep the wondering, angry,former soldier thing, in search of what in VA, going?<br /><br />Might be time for Reacher to find that woman, marry her and settle down.....<br /><br />On another note, I am floored that Tom Cruise is going to play Reacher, really, Cruise?  All 4'9\\" of him?  Liam Neesan, Dennis Haysbert, or Adam Beck come to mind, as they can really portray Reacher, and are proven actors.<br /><br />Now, if they really wanted a Reacher look-a-like, a guy who could do his character justice, has the look, the size, the intellect, and mad fighting skills, look no further than my friend and mentor, Nick Hughes a former French Foreign Legionnaire para commando, bodyguard and black belt in multiple disciplines and participant on The Deadliest Warrior series..

0525953728|5.0|The fact that the author was there on the scene, makes this book a credible read.  Sorrowfully, our government attempted to present a differing story on how Osama was taken out, which doesn't surprise this 20-year retired Air Force Veteran.  This soldier took great risks in telling the real story and my hat is off to him.<br /><br />John V. Lucas, Jr.
B000068FY0|5.0|Truly one of the great rock albums of all time. I just finished listening to this fantastic collection of songs for the nth time, and it is as fresh as when I first listened to it in college 35 years ago. Supertramp has always been one of my favorite rock bands. I can hardly call them rock -- rather symphonic geniuses who blended the best of orchestral instruments, rock and that great British sound into this masterpiece.  Released in 1974 at the height of the rock era this is one for the ages.  The recording quality of the re-release is superb -- as good as any digital recording and maybe better.  Sadly I supposed, rock began a slow enexorable downhill march starting in the mid to late 1970's.  I am a confessed prog rock fan,and I guess Supertramp sort of fits that genre, but not quite. Prog Rock has a tendency to take itself too seriously, and Supertramp is both playful and serious at the same time.  Fabulous.  11 on a 10 point scale as Nigel would say!  (-:
B003O86FMW|4.0|What an amazing book to follow the already great beginning. From the start to the finish i could barely put down my kindle. truly a must read!
B0074MTTEK|5.0|The subject is very interesting, and the book provides an easy to read high level explanation of the science, dipping into details to provide a satisfying level of detail, only occasionally making the non-biologist's head spin in the alphabet soup of sequence and protein names.<br /><br />There is also a good balance in providing some basic background for the novice without burdening the more experienced with too much of it.
B007GCY8FS|5.0|Lee Childs always delivers and his new novel, A Wanted Man, purchased on Kindle is no exception. Jack Reacher is the most mysterious and intriguing character while living a deceptively simple life. When I finished this novel I'm anxiously awaiting the next book
B000W9399S|5.0|I am not normally a fan of science fiction, but Terry Pratchett's books are an exception. He is clever, funny, and smart. I bought this copy as a gift for a friend as I have trouble talking my friends - older women - into giving Pratchett a try. That's a shame. They are missing a lot of chuckles. (I can't read his books in bed, because I wake my husband up when I laugh out loud.) Really, stop being so serious. (Well, given the popularity of 50 Shades of Whatever, \\"serious\\" is probably the wrong word.) Try this, I bet you'll like it.
B008J05EL8|5.0|this is very nicely put together product and is dead simple to use. I recommend this product.<br />buy it today, don't miss out.
0345522478|4.0|I had a lot of fun reading this novel. A great mix of fantasy, action and comedy. Thoroughly enjoyable. Well written and edited too.<br /><br />My only complaint was that it seemed a little short, but perhaps that's because I sped through the book  since I was enjoying it so much. I'll be buying the sequel.
B0098WWEH8|5.0|\\"Shields\\", Grizzly Bear's fourth and latest full-length album, falls somewhere between \\"Yellow House\\" and \\"Veckatimest\\", not in likability, but, rather, in construction, which may make it their most accomplished effort to date. In my first spin of \\"Shields\\" nothing struck me with the immediacy of \\"Two Weeks\\" or \\"While I Wait for the Others\\", nothing as dazzling as \\"Cheerleaders\\" or \\"Foreground\\". Veckatimest, metaphorically, was like receiving fellatio from someone you've always lusted after but who you've perceived as lacking the character to actually fall in love with, that is until that moment when you are gifted with the glorious sensations of their love. Afterwards asleep in one another's arms, you wonder all night who this beautiful maniac is anyways, to make you feel so enamored suddenly and where it was they came from. \\"Shields\\" isn't the type of record that will give you that kind of instant gratification again but it will give you an idea of who the bewitching creature you have fallen in love with is really. In contrast, \\"Yellow House\\", which I purchased after viewing a late night television rendition of \\"On a Neck, On a Spit\\", produced a response that would take time to catch up with. Initially I was disappointed with the entirety of \\"Yellow House\\" because I had anticipated more of a guitar and drum type record as opposed to the minimalist instrumentation and concentrated vocal harmonies that played so fundamental to its complexity. I would not appreciate its arrangements until a year later when I stumbled upon the song \\"Knife\\" by accident, faintly recognizing it, connecting with it, falling under a spell of sorts, pulling the album from it's dusty shelf because of this chance encounter and reexamining it with slightly more weathered eyes. In my reintroduction I was overwhelmed by what I could not see before, maybe because I was not in the same place I had been a year previous in life. Sometimes you have to be in the right place at the right time to identify with and appreciate certain music, books or films. This factor, in a much diluted sense, came into play upon repeated listens to \\"Shields\\" in which tracks such as \\"Sleeping Ute\\", \\"Yet Again\\", \\"A Simple Answer\\" and \\"Sun in your Eyes\\" began to stand out with specific shape, colors, emotions and intents, as marvelously textured songs do, becoming more fulfilling as one grows to know the depth of their circles. \\"Shields\\" is the mastery of everything the band has learned through their previous efforts coalesced with a sense of identity, realized in a balance of both accessibility and challenge that lend to the possibility that \\"Shields\\" may be as timeless, if not more so, than both its predecessors. As for the year at hand it certainly is one of the most rewarding listens out there.
B00881VLCE|5.0|This puzzle game is so much fun! The pictures are cute! It is so much fun that I think more people should get this app!
B0097S0TM0|5.0|I'm not the kind of girl that goes for all the mushy stuff. I love P!nk and this album because she keeps it real. Some days you want to hug the person and others you want to \\"smack them in their whole face\\" yet, you love them completely!!! Thanks P!nk for the Truth About Love!!

B008MG1E4A|5.0|A can't put down kind of reading. Mark Owen keeps you on the edge of your seat and he puts you in the story with him and you feel that you are a part of something bigger than yourself. God Bless him and all the service men and women who fight for our great country!
B008XG1X18|5.0|I hsve never had a problem with this app. on my Kindle Fire. I actually prefer it to my computer!

B006OCM0G0|5.0|not too involved . Easy and fun. Love to do it when I'm watching Tv. VERY..VERY.. additive! !!!! Helps pass the time when I'm bored at work...
B007PT3QOQ|2.0|Although the plot is interesting it is another send me stuff game where you need friends to neighbor you and send you stuff. I have enough trouble with that on FB
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|the app was exactly what I was looking for. it is a basic calculator that is very simple to use.
B009CPRYG2|5.0|Absolutely nailed it!  Near flawless translation of the graphic novel that changed both Batman and comics forever.  Can't wait for part 2!
B00008BXJG|4.0|Highway to Hell and Shot Down in Flames are the two songs I bought this CD (album) for.  The rest of the music is all right, but those are the two gems.  You can't get them on MP3 music, so this was the only way I could down load them on my ipod  This is good old fashioned rock and roll, no more, no less.  Enjoy!
B004I744AS|5.0|It include word games, horoscopes, tidbits of daily article information, heck, even the weather!!!! Really easy to use, and works great on the kindle fire. can also adjuat the display settings. this app deserves the 5 star ratings!!!

B008KNZ4LO|5.0|I enjoyed the movie & the action was awesome.  The action was better than I had thought it would be. Some great martial arts in this movie that was off the chain!!!
B008LSVL6U|5.0|Fantastic show, amazing musicians. I knew of Mr. Wilson, but this is my first encounter with his work.<br />Highly recommend this near flawless show.
B008J34466|5.0|I love Pink and I love this CD.  It's been on repeat in my car ever since I got it.  I just wish there was one CD that included all the bonus tracks.  I don't understand why there has to be multiple versions of a CD that are not available in all areas and markets to all fans?  I think everyone who buys the CD should get all the same tracks, whether they buy it from Amazon or iTunes or Target, etc. and whether they buy it in the US or in Japan, etc.  FTR, I have this same complaint with any artist/studio that does this.
B007MB5OCE|4.0|This book is not for the serious minded.  It's light and humorous and at times it made me laugh out loud.  I especially likes the way the author ties all of his zany characters together.
B008Y2FRFO|1.0|I was on level 120 and this latest update uninstalled the app which caused my ongoing game to be deleted. I had finished a couple of puzzles. Now I have to start all over. Very annoyed!
B008MG1E4A|5.0|The author does not glamorize anything but gives enough info to show what really happened and for it to be understandable. I'm grateful for such dedicated and courageous defenders!
B007RTAR64|5.0|my daughter is very happy with the doll , the details are just like the character of the movie. She takes care of her doll so right now everything is ok with and nothing is detached or broken from the doll.The standard is a good option to put the barbie in display on a shelf.
B000QRIGLC|5.0|This story of survival is truly unbelievable and a testament to the remarkable honor and toughness of America's warfighters. The book is well written and very hard to put down.
B003CI90MQ|3.0|After browsing all the books on photography, I found out that a lot of things said on this book is pretty common stuff. You can find the same tips and techniques on other books on easy photography for much less, and a lot of them are better at explaining things and doing them the easier way.
B008Z9YGEE|5.0|The movie was good.  Good story and plot with lots of action. I wonder if the next one is goinf to be as good.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|Very interesting and almost mind-blowing.  Enjoyed reading every page of it. Proud of our SEALS and of the United States of America
B0018OIK0E|3.0|Shaun of the Dead is a interesting twist in the zombie movie genre.  It stars Simon Pegg, who is easy to cheer for as Shaun, a mild mannered chap in his late twenties who is at a crossroads with his job, girlfriend, and mom and stepdad.  The along come the zombies.  This is a buddy film, with a romantic twist.  There is some vulgarity and pervasive violence, so this is not suitable for children under the age of sixteen.<br /><br />Overall, the movie moves a little slowly at points, but there is a good bit of dry humor and, again, Shaun is a protagonist that I ended up liking more than I disliked.
034580404X|5.0|After hearing all the buzz of the book, I ordered the Trilogy with a dull expectation. And plan on taking me about 4 to 5 weeks to complete my reading. Boy! was I wrong. I read all three in 4 days (vacation.) The storyline was great. It was a bit demeaning to women in some chapters, but it was very intense and arousing. I recommend the Trilogy to ladies who are having a hard time in the romance/intimate area of their life.
B007IXWKUK|4.0|the second book was better than the first. the first had too much sex and S&M to suit me. second was more loving and careing and the third was even better

B0052RDHTM|5.0|This is one of the most exciting books by Ken Follet.  He is able to weave political issues with the lives of the countries involved and especially the people, families, and social mores of the period. Helps me understand some of the stories my grandparents talked about.  Ken Follet is a most eloquent writer.  I certainly will read the entire trilogy.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I loved this book! There is so much more to the story then just the intimate scenes. I will probably read the trilogy over and over again.
B007H1HQW0|1.0|Product was received as ordered.  Instructions are overly complicated .... hire an industrial designer or good tech writer to improve and simplify your instructions.  So far, I have tried using on 4 wine bottles.  None have cut well with this device.  It is difficult to maintain a consistent cut on the outer edge of the bottle.  I will continue to experiment and, if my results improve, then I will post an update
B004QZ9PLU|4.0|This book is typical of Nicholas Sparks.  Hopeful, but sad.  I would have liked to see a different ending where all would have been happy.  It was well written and kept my interest throughout, even though I felt this would be the ending when it was so probable that he was  shot and would die.
B000W237RE|5.0|This way exceeded my expectations.  I was only familiar with Melissa and bought it because of that one song.  I did not realize how good this group was.  I was surprised that the southern rock extended guitar work captured me as much as it did.  I highly recommend this album.
B009329Y30|4.0|This was a great love story. One that both my husband and I both enjoyed! Would highly recommend to those looking for a romantic movie to share with that special someone.
B009KHDT0C|5.0|I love Johnny Depp and Tim Burton combinations. Never fails to entertain when these two get together.The dark humor was fantastic. I laughed thru the whole movie. Intelligent repartee. The whole cast was great in their roles and of course a happy ending with a twist.<br />You've got appreciate the humor, it's all over the dialogue. I'd like a sequel considering the Doctor character came to life plus the house and business needs to be rebuild and well, you've got three vampires, a werewolf plus a kid that talks and commands the dead. What else do you need??<br /><br />L.B.G.<br />Clearwater, Fla
B0053O89JM|5.0|I have been a fan of Gregory House since the first episode of \\"House M.D.\\" and have enjoyed most seasons, so I bought this DVD with great expectations. Alas, I was disappointed in the quality of the writing, which didn't live up to previous seasons. Still, I have DVDs of all the seasons, which I purchased from Amazon.com, and frequently screen at home. The point I'd like to make is that, to fully enjoy the series, you need to watch every episode from the very first one on. All in all, this was a good purchase. P.S. Amazon.com furnished this DVD in brand-new condition at a very reasonable price.[[ASIN:B0053O89JM House, M.D.: Season Eight]]
B005N7CA3A|5.0|While most might say that this piece of work is considerably different from his past two works, Secret Codes and Battleships is one of his finest works to be put out on the market. After the success of Spin and the acclaim of The Tension and The Spark, Darren Hayes went personally into This Delicate Thing We've Made, exploring all aspects of synth music and keyboard sounds. To incorporate an orchestra while maintaining the same pop sound from the old days of other works would be slightly difficult for those not strong in the business or young. Darren Hayes exquisitely performs this enough to be acclaimed. The lyricism is still natural of Hayes, romantic affections and the like, but still a reminder of days gone by when lyricism was the most important part of songwriting. The entire album feels like a river, never choppy or out of place; everything sticks together. Of course, there are standouts: \\"Bloodstained Heart\\" is one of the best of his career (even with Savage Garden), and \\"Taken By the Sea\\" is a wonderful start song to the album. While not what is popular in the industry now, nothing can stop honesty and lovely lyricism from being good. And Darren Hayes is one of the most sincere you can find. I bought this copy physically, because it was worth it; I'd definitely recommend this to pretty much everyone.
B007FG9LIE|4.0|Enjoyed this crazy twin peaks/stepford wives/sci fi romp.<br />Author knows what it takes to keep a reader coming back for more.
B007VUA7VO|4.0|Enjoy this app... helps to keep track of battery life... but has a complete breakdown of how long I may have to actually use the kindle...very detailed.
B00834FP5A|5.0|Awsome toy for a hardcore monster hunter fan, its a little fragile so I dont recomend it to the little ones. But to the right person its the funnest toy. For the most part it is completly posable but the wings are thick rubber so they are a little stiff, but its perfect to pose for a battle scene or whatever you like! In total its one of the best MH things I've gotten, definatly worth every penny.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I enjoyed this book more than the first two. Each book of the trilogy was better than the last.  I was a little disappointed in the ending of the first book, so I'm glad I decided to read the second & third.
B008MM9630|5.0|Started playing this game a few months ago because I didn't have to be online to play.  Can't put it down now.  You can go to their mobile community on facebook to get spells and earn more rewards.
B003O86FMW|5.0|If you have read the first installment, you won't be able to resist the second book.  In fact, the wait between the two could be hazardous to your health!  Just prepare yourself for another wild ride!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Once I got past the shock of sexual content, the book was a page turner.  Great story line. I wish I had a Fifty.
B008XFAT7S|5.0|Best action movie in a long, long time.  Mix of martial arts and gunplay was seamless and unmatched.  This is definitely a must see.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|A much better read then the first one. An actual story line that made you want to read it. Looking forward to the last one.
B007FG9LIE|4.0|Pines does a good job of conveying a creepy, dangerous atmosphere in which the protagonist finds himself. Crouch tells a story that is interesting and somewhat unpredictable without having to obviously manipulate situations or characters too obviously. It won't leave the reader stunned by its brilliance, but it is a page-turner in the good sense of the term and has no huge holes in the story.
B0086DBE62|5.0|Movie was very entertaining, my wife and seven year old enjoyed the story line as well as the seven dwarfs. Plot was good, very thought out and the special effects were excellent!!  Definitely recommend this movie!!
B000FC11A6|5.0|This is a brilliant, unique work that stands alone within its own genre. I'll leave recapping the story to others doing reviews here and instead simply say that to not read this book is to make a sad choice; it is not only fascinating, but tremendous fun to read. I recommended it to my brother (among others) and when he finished it, he immediately returned to page 1 and read it all over again. This is Neal Stephenson, a very gifted writer, at his best.
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|great game with hints if you want them. you don't have to use them if you want to be challenged.can't wait for the next!
B007IXWKUK|5.0|By far one of, the, best books, I've ever read! Read all, three books in less, than a week. It was a very interesting book, very well written.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed the 2nd book of this trilogy as I did the first. I am most anxious to purchase the 3rd. I was quite skeptic when I started reading the trilogy of Fifty Shades of Gray, but  now I am so glad I did. Great writing and kept me interested and on my toes. Must read.
B008PZ69T8|5.0|beautiful music....never knew how lovely it is to listen to such angelic voices and how relaxing it makes me feel.,
B004J4WLB4|5.0|I really enjoyed this book.  The main charactor really got to me which does not always happen.  I anxiously look forward to other books by this writer.
B007GCY8FS|2.0|I have loved every Jack Reacher book up to this one but not including this one.  As far as this book, it seems Jack Reacher took two giant steps forward and four back, to be in the same place as when it began.  So many emotional possibilities were just ignored.<br /><br />In addition, my allegiance to Lee Child has smoldered into dead ashes after his trying to convince us that Tom Cruise would be a good Jack Reacher since \\"Jack Reacher is whatever we visualize him to be...\\"  In the books, even this latest one, he was over 6 feet tall and a giant of a blonde and beautiful man.  I too will boycott the films and think twice before pre-ordering another Reacher book.
B006LSZECO|5.0|I love the mystery genre and it is rare that a plot can surprise me, but this one did.  I could not put it down after starting it.  The characters are interesting because they are not sympathetic at all, especially the protagonist.  Usually when I dislike the person telling the story I lose interest in the book.  In this case I keep reading and let myself be swept along by the story and twists.
B006AZZPCM|2.0|As said in my title; it was good while it lasted,then,it stopped working and I uninstalled it. Wow, it rhymes... Sort of, isn't it?
B003O86FMW|5.0|After Hunger Games you MUST read this . You have to find out what happens to Katniss. Great trilogy !  Fast reading . Didnt want to put it down.
0525953728|5.0|The book was easy to read and understand.  Being a retired Navy Sailor, I enjoyed the background data provided that helped explain what is Navy SEAL goes through and why they are the best of the best.  I would recommend this book to anyone interested in following the footsteps of a Navy SEAL as it provides a starting point of what they would endure.  Unfortunately, the downside to the book (as I am sure there are downsides to any book) is the fact that many professions ensdure and that is the huge separations and divorces that were, not mentioned in the book, but imagined based on what was written.  I know that Navy SEALS put their lives on the line each and every day for American citizens and we should all be grateful for the training and dedication of these graer men!  The book was well written and I tink it should be read by all.
B007TBZ63Y|3.0|First of all, and this was noted by other reviewers, this book freezes in spots.  Mine froze at 51%, 55%, and at 95%.  It's hard to enjoy the story when this is happening.  Customer Service is evaluating this and will request a fixed version from the publisher if it does it on their system.<br /><br />Second of all, this is one of Rick Riordan's weaker books.  Leo was fantastic, bright and funny, but much of the humor and suspense found in other Riordan books just isn't there.  There's a great scene involving Annabeth, but overall the characters are flat and very little seems to happen.  Seven main characters may be a bit too much, especially since the book keeps referring back to previous books and the reader is left trying to remember which character is from which camp and who's related to which god and who's in love with who.<br /><br />Personally, I think the book is worth reading but it's also worth waiting to get it at the libray.
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|There are not enough words to describe how wonderful the photograpy, acting and story line are. I have seen both season one and two. I have started watching them all over again just to see the beauty of them. I am looking forward to January for the third season.  I have to admit a great deal of fondness for Maggie Smith who is superlative in her part, though everyone really is superlative. Great cast!
0385737955|5.0|I'm going to try to keep this as spoiler free as possible and short for those of you who haven't read this book. I thought this book was absolutely amazing. I finished it in about 5 days. When I picked it up I couldn't put it down because it's one of those books where you just want to keep reading to find out what happens next. Beginning is a little slow in my opinion but then as you get close the the middle of the book everything is just crazy and lots of things are happening, and then the ending. Oh boy, the ending was huge surprise as well as a heart touching moment for myself. Overall, it is well written and the story just suspenseful and plain awesome. I highly recommend this book to anyone who loves a fast paced book.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|Battery HD does exactly what the description states, I love being able to see exactly how long the battery will last. This is an app that deserves to be shared!
B00441GYZ6|5.0|Product was as stated.  Company was very good getting my new debit card number<br />in the system for this purchase.  Movie exactly as described.  Fast service
B003O86FMW|5.0|I started reading the Hunger Games Trilogy to ensure that is was ok for my kid to read.  I am SO glad that I did. The story is captivating. The characters are interesting. It is a page turner. I read all 3 books in 3 weeks. I do work full time and I am a mom of two boys. So it was good enough that I squeezed in my reading time when I could.
B006TJXZ30|5.0|Now I can get my email, sort it and stay on top. I use it for my work email on my droid and my own email. Its so easy to use
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|I enjoyed the series thoroughly.  The third book definitely throws a twist that I didn't see coming. The first and second books were my favorites, but this finishes off the series nicely.
B002RXVOX0|5.0|This movie is wonderfully terrifying.<br />Be sure to also watch and listen to the director's commentary to understand how the movie was made.<br />Sit in a dark room, turn up the volume and get yourself ready to be thoroughly entertained and frightened.
B007HJ98XC|2.0|The show itself is of the highest quality but its so violent it just lacks all humanity and since everyone dies there is nothing to follow
B0018STVHQ|4.0|a bit different than the Tudors series, but will well acted and nicely done. Scarlet johansen is really terrific in this!
B006BAEQB2|4.0|As usual, Philippa Gregory not only catches the history of the period, but catches my attention as well.  Her novels take me back in time and leave me feeling as if I have lived the life of her main characters.
B0064O927I|5.0|My grandson requested this particular watch for his 14th birthday. He really not expect to get it once he checked out the price. I searched the internet and found it at Amazon for $40 less than other places. He was surprised and super happy! And of course, so was his Mimi.
B00571F26Y|4.0|This is the scariest book I've read in a while. The author makes a plausible case for dangers of eating modern wheat and, by association, our current high carbohydrate lifestyle. I worry that the same argument and logic was applied to yeast about fifteen years ago, telling us that the yeast in our bodies was poisoning us all. All in all, a useful look at the impact of diet on our health.
B005D9MUWY|5.0|There are a few things I'd like to change about SwiftKey, but overall, it's the best keyboard available. Can't type without it.
B00699SDR8|5.0|Gaarder created a wonderful novel to teach philosophy 101 to the masses.  Apart for the very unique literary device used, the background given is accurate and puts so much of the story of philosophy into historical perspective.  Strongly recommended for anyone with a passing interest in the development of western civilization.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Read all three.  Kinda late in the game.  First book hard to read in beginning.  Level of writing amateurish.  Once started I was hooked.  You have to read all three to truly understand and appreciate this very complicated love story.  I can't wait for the movie.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|Great book and a wonderful second in the series.  However I did reread part 1 and I'm glad I did as the author does not begin with a summary of what transpired in the first book.  Also the time interval between each of the parts was too long and I hope that the final installment will be published soon.
B0080CL0HM|3.0|It's a good movie...I would see it again. It's an interesting roll to see Rob playing, but its very sexy.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|I didn't think I could love Gideon more.  I didn't think I could hate him more either.  Get ready for a roller coaster that ends with another cliffhanger.  This book frustrated me to no end but I loved it.  It was constantly up and down.  For a cliffhanger, I was very grateful that it ended like it did.  Love them both and can't wait for the next round.
B008XG1X18|5.0|The best app ever. Works great on my Kindle Fire. Have found tons of DIY craft ideas and good food ideas.
0525953728|3.0|No Easy Day is very badly written. You will find clauses that masquerade as sentences and misused words galore. The last 1/3 of the book is the actual story of the raid that killed OBL. The rest is a few chapters with \\"cliffhangers' to get you to keep reading and many chapters relating descriptions of how \\"glorious\\" the SEALs are with a special emphasis on how \\"glorious\\" Mark Owens is.  If you believe all he writes you will wonder how any SEAL team was able to accomplish anything if he was not along.<br /><br />In my copy the maps that would have the raid clearer to understand all came AFTER the description of the events. A good editor would have moved those maps or given the page numbers of the maps in the prose. Actually a good editor would have asked him to re-write the book.<br /><br />If you are really, really interested in SEAL training and the lead up to missions and you are willing to wade through a lot of gratuitous bragging to get to the mission itself, you might find this book enjoyable.
B006XF5BTG|5.0|Great book... within one day of receiving it I read up to the 18th chapter. The only problem I have with the book is that there are a few spelling errors, other than that i love it.
0345803485|1.0|One of Ana's lines in the book.. and that's what this book is, crap. Seriously.. the author is not much of a writer.. the book is repetitive and dull. The characters so unbelievable as to be farcical. I know it's fantasy but come now....really? a beautiful, sexy , 22 yr old virgin hooks up with a young, handsome, mysterious billionaire by happenstance (she fills in to interview him when her roommate falls ill) The roommate incidentally ends up forming the beast with two backs (yes that's how it's stated in the book) with the brother.. The writing is just that bad....<br />Holy Crap, I think I'll write a book... it can't be any worse than this nonsense...
B004LROMX4|5.0|I find this one of the better \\"alien invasion\\" series produced.  I like the fact they never showed the \\"we're being invaded\\" portion of things. They started with the aftermath, and it's about what people are doing to survive, and fight back, following the invasion.  It's not a lost cause for everyone.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I loved this entire trilogy it is a page turner and keeps you on your toes! This book has a lot of in expected events and is worth reading!!
B008578PRK|4.0|I found this movie pretty scary and the ending surprised me. It was a change to see Daniel Radcliffe in something besides Harry Potter.
B003O86FMW|4.0|The second book in the hunger games trilogy was in my opinion better than the first. It captured me from start to finish.
B005O7Q6FM|5.0|I love castle, i could watch this show everyday, great show, drama, comedy, and romance all rolled into one.  the chemistry between the nathan and stana is electric. love love love it

B00594XOZU|5.0|I've used other texting apps and KIK kills the competition.  The speed in which the messenger sends and receives messages is unbelieveable.  The system has never let me down.  Textfree for instance is always needing to update and drops messages.  KIK has always come through for me.  This app is a MUST try.
B008N5UX9M|3.0|First off, people seem to like down thumbing my reviews as of recently, because I don't immediately jump on the bandwagon and give everything in near sight a 5 star rating. First off, the purpose of a review is to state your opinion on a product and not just gush about how amazing it is, mind you this is coming from someone who will admit to being totally biased because he loves Iron Maiden and they're his favourite band. I ask you, please state why you're thumbs downing my review in the comments, and don't just down thumb it because I didn't give it 5 stars and I apparently hurt you. Do also be wary of my grammar as English is my second language.<br /><br />I have listened to this album front to back several times. It was one of my most anticipated releases of the year, if the most anticipated for me. I was excited to hear it since it got announced back in July, with 8 days until the Maiden concert I was going to. I have been a huge fan of the band since 2006 and have seen them three times live, own pretty much everything with their namenon it, and regularly listen to \\"Seventh Son\\" and several other of their albums front to back on a regular basis. I even own every Bruce solo effort, every ASAP and Untouchables album, and H's side project \\"Primal Rock Rebellion\\"...<br /><br />...but I just can't get into this album. I really don't know what it is about it. There's very few tracks I'd consider weak, they're almost all pretty good. But, it leaves me feeling cold every time I hear it.<br /><br />This Is My God: Dull track. Zero energy and super repetitive. Taylor's vocals aren't as bad as everyone says, he is just fine on this album and at times reminds me of Bono. But this track just bores me. The music video isn't much better, but at least Steve shot the music video in parts of my home province, Alberta. 2/10<br /><br />Lost Worlds: Not bad. In a way, reminds me a bit of latter-day Rush. I like the lyrics and heavy feel of the tune. The chorus in particular is amazing and manages to add the kick this song needed, in a way. 7/10<br /><br />Karma Killer: here's an interesting track. It reminds me of Gods of War, from Bruce's \\"Balls to Picasso\\" album. It has a heavy feel, and the chorus is very Maiden like. \\"Karma killaaaahhh, cannot get enough...\\" It's a tad on the repetitive side, but it's fun and catchy. 7/10<br /><br />Us Against the World: Decent tune, I'll listen. But put it on a Maiden album and I'd hit the skip button. 6/10<br /><br />The Chosen Ones: This song heavily rips off bands like The Who and Boston, but that's alright, because I just so happen to like both. It carries on for a minute longer than it should and does tend to repeat itself too much. I still like the tune. Very fun and catchy.<br /><br />A World Without Heaven: this is my favourite track on the album. It wouldn't be out of place on Virtual XI (I like that album a lot, deal with it) and it has an epic feel, the chorus especially still sticks in my head long after the song is done. A great effort, 10/10<br /><br />Judas: boring 2/10<br /><br />Eyes of The Young: not a bad tune. Reminds me a bit of a song you'd hear off of The X Factor. It is a bit too repetitive though, 6/10<br /><br />These Are The Hands: my second favourite tune. It has a nostalgic feel and takes me back to better times, for better or worse. Catchy hook and some epic bass from Steve Harris himself. 7/10<br /><br />The Lesson: Gothic tinged ballad. A good way to close the album on a subdued note, I must say I really dig the strings and violins in the background. 7/10<br /><br />First off, I guess we should be glad that Arry didn't do what most did when people go off on different tangents, you know how they make inexplicable dubstep music and what not. And thankfully this album is better than that unholy mess, \\"Awoken Broken\\" by a certain side project by H which shall remain unnamed (sorry H, I really do love you and all, but being in a nu-metal band isn't working out for you), but thisalbum, as I stated above, leaves me feeling empty.<br /><br />Part of it is because the album didn't have any staying power outside of \\"A World Without Heaven\\". That's a song I'd willingly put on my iPad and play over and over. After listening to the album, all but the above stated track pretty much went in one ear and out the other. It's not so much the fact that the tracks are bad. Aside from \\"This is My God\\" and \\"Judas\\", the tracks don't really stand out.<br /><br />I dont own a copy of the album, but rather I listened to it 5 times during the listening party on the official Iron Maiden site. And since I own all other things with Arry's namesake, I probably will end up buying it, at least when the price comes down.<br /><br />***worthwhile, but know what you're getting yourself into first***album, as I stated above, leaves me feeling empty.<br /><br />Part of it is because the album didn't have any staying power outside of \\"A World Without Heaven\\".

B008RYN44U|1.0|I will keep this simple and visceral: My ears bled worse than a honey boo boo's mothers period as I listened to the shitty incarnation No Doubt have labeled as a 'new album.' Teenage dreams shattered and another band that should have stayed in bed. Do not buy this crap.
B008G12ERC|3.0|First off, you see my star rating for this album? 3 stars? That means I think the album has good points, and -dramatic music- bad points too.If you down thumb my review, please state why, as I'm not someone who gives everything in near sight a 4 or 5 star rating. The purpose of a review is to state your opinion and not to act all fanboyish over the product at hand. You're not going to change my opinion, and I wouldnt dream of changing yours. But if in the comments, you have some insightful comments to offer, like \\"listen to this track again, there's a lot you might have missed\\", I might just consider it.<br /><br />I'll admit, I'm in ways, a latecomer to the Muse party. I didn't get into them until 2009. I heard all their albums before the Resistance and loved them all. Resistance is not a bad album, it's a decent one and despite a few cringe worthy tunes, there were still some good ones. When I heard the derpstep in the trailer for this album, I was a tad worried. Is their new album really a pile of dubstep crap? Are they jumping on the bandwagon, when they're such a ridiculously talented band? Nonetheless, after hearing the Olympics song, which I really disliked, and Madness, which was a nice tune, and Unsustainable, which is a nice mix of genres and the dubstep track, I figured I'd give it a listen.<br /><br />And so it's at this point where I'm guessing you're expecting a justification of my rating for the album. If you took away the two dubstep-tinged tracks, you have just another Muse album. Which is exactly the problem- Muse have played it too safely with this album and decided to just take the classic Muse approach. While it isn't bad, it leaves me thinking that band are so much more talented than this, and that they could write, and innovate in different ways if they wanted to. Notice how different \\"Origin of Symmetry\\" is from \\"Showbiz\\"? And \\"The Resistance\\" from \\"Black Holes\\"? Yet all of them have the \\"Muse\\" sound, that remains consistent through the band's albums. Problem is, the band didn't change much from The Resistance. They just figured \\"that album sold, and we could record ourselves taking a shower and folks will eat it up\\", so they just went with... Muse, as a sound for the album. Even if Chris states that \\"We tried something radically different\\", he's wrong, it's just another Muse album.<br /><br />\\"Supremacy\\" starts off the album, and it's a decent tune. Has a bit of a 007 feel to it, like it wouldn't be out of place in the new James Bond movie, \\"Skyfall\\". The verses are cool and I love the big drums as well as the marching drum beat throughout. The strings are probably the first thing you notice about the tune, and while they don't totally intrude, sadly the song could have survived without them. \\"Madness\\" is next. The song has the underlying motif of a beat built around Matt softly singing \\"M-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-mad-mad-mad\\", which obviously amounts to him completing the word \\"madness\\" at the end. The song's lyrics were written after Bellamy got in a fight with his girlfriend Kate Hudson, and are nice and heartfelt. Towards the end, the song starts to take a bit of a U2 direction, as it wouldn't sound out of place on the \\"Zooropa\\" album.<br /><br />Next is \\"Panic Station\\", a song that sounds a bit like a mix of a Franz Ferdinand tune and \\"Supermassive Black Hole\\". It's catchy and all, but it just isn't what Muse is known for. I don't hate it like everyone else does,  but I'd willingly skip it, and the next track, \\"Prelude\\", which isn't really important at all.<br /><br />Sadly, Muse will never live down the next track, \\"Survival\\". It was written for the Olympics, and hell, even that annoying \\"I Believe\\" song by Nikki Yanofsky (the song of the Vancouver 2010 winter Olympics) feels more Olympics than this. The opening of the tune is cringe worthy, but thankfully when the singing kicks in, it starts to get tolerable, until the choir from The Omen soundtrack start chanting \\"So I told you\\" and \\"You were warned and didn't listen\\" for absolutely no reason at all. The song is easy the most over-the-top thing I've ever heard in my life, and not in a good way. If you want to write a song for the Olympics, why not just do a typical Muse track like \\"Time is Running Out\\" or \\"Resistance\\", instead of wasting a perfectly talented choir and making it sound like Queen singing a theme for a Tim Burton movie?<br /><br />Thankfully things pick up afterword, with the next track being \\"Follow Me\\". It starts with the sound of a baby's heart beat, and Matt crooning a lovely tune. The song starts to sound a bit like \\"MK Ultra\\" from their previous albums before the dubstep beat kicks in, and even then it's tolerable. It's a fun track that at the same time sounds really much like a filler track. \\"Animals\\" might be my favourite song in the album- a soft, subdued rocker that wouldn't be out of place on Origin of Symmetry, and reminds me a bit of a more uptempo \\"Screenager\\". The song closes with a rather frightening sound clip from the Wall Street Trading Floor, which explains the song's meaning- it's about the greed of people in the stock market, and how they show no regard for others, only caring about themselves. Sadly, it's followed by \\"Explorers\\", a song so forgettable I can't even remember anything about it.<br /><br />Big Freeze is a catchy tune, but THOSE LYRICS. While listening to it, I thought to myself, \\"if I hear the words Don't give up' one more time, I'm throwing this CD in the garbage\\", as I heard them several times throughout (and similar phrases too). It's a shame, because the song's music is fine enough. \\"Save Me\\" and \\"Liquid State\\" are most known for having Christopher Wolstenholme singing. As he's my favourite member of the band, I was anticipating these tracks greatly. And he's a decent singer, he sounds a bit like the guy from Finger Eleven. But there's a reason he doesn't sing for Muse. \\"Liquid State\\" is the better of these two tracks, mainly because it's faster and heavier, but both tracks are really forgettable and the album would have survived without them.<br /><br />The last two tracks are the finale of the album, and both are very different. Starting off with \\"The 2nd Law: Unsustainable\\". People accuse this song of being too much of an attempt to jump on the brostep bandwagon, but I think it's a very intriguing mix of genres. It starts off as a classical tune that wouldn't be out of place in a Zack Snyder film. There's an interesting monologue explaining the 2nd law of therodynamics. \\"New energy cannot be created and if high energy  is being destroyed, an economy based on endless growth is...\\" is suddenly cut off by a robot voice phonetically saying \\"UN...SUSTAINABLE\\", before the song explodes into a brostep breakdown. And despite my utter distaste of dubstep, the breakdown sounds awesome. For starters, the band actually plays the dubstep part on their instruments, as opposed to Skrillex and (insert generic step musician here), who does it all on a computer. Then a few bars of proggy symphonic rock pla, with Matt vocalizing, which manages to be very epic feeling. Then, after another monologue and epic drumming, the brostep part comes back in again.<br /><br />Next is \\"Isolated System\\". There's no dubstep here, and the song is more trance influenced than anything. The song loops the line from the previous song, \\"In an isolated system, the entropy can only increase. The song is decidedly more trance influenced, and has a subdued. electro-trance beat  throughout. This is a truly unique track. It feels very subdued, and also like there's a lot of rage and energy dying to get out at the same time.<br /><br />The 2nd Law is very different from its predecessor. They're similar in the sense that they're both complete messes. But The Resistance is a mess that somehow manages to keep moving in a straight line, has a sense of direction and knows where it's headed. The 2nd Law is more like a six year old kid with ADHD telling a story. It constantly loses track of where it's going, and seems to not know what its goal really is. The album feels more like a compilation instead of an album- the tracks feel really out of sequence and like the band didn't seem to know what they wanted with the album.<br /><br /> Problem is, it's too much of a Muse album, even for a Muse album. I really would like if they decided to do something outside their comfort zone. And it's not like they have to radically change, I mean, hell, my favourite band, Iron Maiden change all the time and yet still have that Iron Maiden sound. But they don't make it so that they just get lazy and take the classic Route.<br /><br />Yet, the album is still very listenable and there's a good number of standout tracks. Sure it's my 2nd least favourite of their albums (The Resistance takes that top spot), but it's enjoyable to an extent, and I'd like to hear how the tracks sound live.both tracks are really forgettable and the album would have survived without them.<br /><br />The last two tracks are the finale of the album, and both are very different. Starting off with \\"The 2nd Law: Unsustainable\\". People accuse this song of being too much of an attempt to jump on the brostep bandwagon, but I think it's a very intriguing mix of genres. It starts off as a classical tune that wouldn't be out of place in a Zack Snyder film. There's an interesting monologue explaining the 2nd law of therodynamics. \\"New energy cannot be created and if high energy  is being destroyed, an economy based on endless growth is...\\" is suddenly cut off by a robot voice phonetically saying \\"UN...SUSTAINABLE\\", before the song explodes into a brostep breakdown. And despite my utter distaste of dubstep, the breakdown sounds awesome. For starters, the band actually plays the dubstep part on their instruments, as opposed to Skrillex and (insert generic step musician here), who does it all on a computer. Then a few bars of proggy symphonic rock pla, with Matt vocalizing, which manages to be very epic feeling. Then, after another monologue and epic drumming, the brostep part comes back in again.<br /><br />Next is \\"Isolated System\\". There's no dubstep here, and the song is more trance influenced than anything. The song loops the line from the previous song, \\"In an isolated system, the entropy can only increase.

B0054R6BFM|5.0|This book moved me beyond belief. couldnt put it down. a must read for teenagers. future english teacher approved. still speechless.
B0088RQ4X4|5.0|A great movie that is not so typical that you can predict it in the 1st 5 min!  I truly enjoyed this wonderful movie.
B008XG1X18|4.0|i love this app but it has alot of bugs sometimes it works but then it will freeze up and force close then when you try to reopen it can take a few times to load but i still like the app just needs some fixes
B002LC8HF0|5.0|Really brings the rest of the story together. Better than the 2nd, more action. Amazing author all around, I've loved every one of his books I've read so far.
0553801473|1.0|i'm so glad to know i'm not alone in being so bored that i've actually finished all five. it's also good to know others are as sick of it as i am. i actually thought i was getting a little slow when i couldn't keep up with who was who, but who can?<br /><br />this is almost like the \\"left behind\\" series but those books were short and the characters few in number.<br /><br />the sameness i guess is we're dumb enough to keep buying and reading and they're happy to keep going to the bank.
B000FC1HBY|2.0|Currently almost halfway through the book.  It is almost nothing but a series of conversations and exposition.  Does anything exciting ever happen, at least a litte bit in the second half?
B007FG9LIE|1.0|This book was hard to follow. I found it very disturbing. Some of the writing was too graffic  for my taste. waited for the happy ending that never came.
B007GCY8FS|3.0|[[ASIN:0385344333 A Wanted Man: A Jack Reacher Novel]]<br />I found this book interesting enough to finish but believe it is time Jack Reacher moved out of no-mans land and stopped wasting his time and mine with travel time along dark lonely highways out west! Lee Childs book One Shot was action packed with happenings...this book was filled with boring car travel between rural states.
B00992CF6W|5.0|As a person who's friends have this on their computer or xbox, I have wanted this for a while.  After starting this game I am now playing this nonestop, building my heart out.  this app does not disappoint, a must have for anyone who has an imagination.
B004Y5AV4M|5.0|If you are a Georgette Heyer fan, you will LOVE \\"Venetia!\\"  I have read almost all of her books and Venetia (and Frederica) are my favorites.<br />  Heyer's mix of romance with her wit and humor are incomparable.  I found myself laughing out loud so many times.  Human nature comes to bear no matter what time period one reads about.<br />  I plan on re-reading this book from time to time.  It's that good!
0307592731|4.0|a fun read for us hikers!  ..............and likely others as well<br />cheryl met some great people on her long trek.<br />a bit too much \\"baggage\\" for me to comprehend with her mom's passing, etc but i still enjoyed the read
B002N14GPE|5.0|loved it ! great for suspense and thrilling too ! I love horror and movies that give you that unexpected ending and this movie is one of the few in my lifetime that revealed an ending I NEVER SAW COMING! Loved it Loved it Love it !
B007FEFLTO|4.0|I read the first book in this series, Fall of Giants, and eagerly anticipated book 2, Winter of the world.  The book was enjoyable, but it is not level in that some parts of the book are better than others.  Follett does indeed deal with all of the characters created in Fall of Giants, but I did not find it as satisfying as some of the other books that he has written.  Look forward to part 3 when it is released.<br /><br />Follett's book is an illustration of what one of my history teachers emphasized.  Be careful of the entremes of the left or the right.  They are the same.  It is almost like they are a circle with Facism and Communism looking like the same thing in practice.  He makes that point very well in Winter of the World.  Which is worse, the extreme form of the right, Fascism, or the extreme form of the left, Communism?  Both are terrible and look much the same in Germany or in Russia or in any other country where they come to power or attempt to come to power.  May be an important lesson for us to hear in this political season in the U. S.  Depressions make us look for fast and easy solutions to difficult economic and social issues.  Winter of the World is worth reading for that reason alone.<br /><br />I read the Kindle version of the novel purchased from Amazon which loaded it on my old Kindle Keyboard as soon as it was released.  Love my Kindle.
B007N8RULO|5.0|I have enjoyed playing this game so much that when I get started I lose track of time. A great way to keep your mind sharp.
B007GCY8FS|5.0|Another excellent Reacher novel as always anticipated from Lee Child!!  The scenes are always well described.  The story lines always grab one's attention early on only to become more intertwined and riveting as the novel unfolds.  I can't wait until Child pens his next Reacher adventure.
B0087HT36U|4.0|this was a real fun game I got hooked on it! I would recommend this game for someone else to download as well!
0525953728|5.0|I preordered this book after hearing about it being released on a morning news show. I personally wanted to know the truth about the Osama Bin Laden story, I believe the American people had the right to know what transpired.<br />So I received the book and began reading. I cannot tell you just how much respect I have for our amazing troops and the jobs they do to preserve our freedom. Mark Owen tells the story in a way that helps you understand just how hard these guys work to catch the bad guys & his training as a Navy SEAL. I couldn't put it down, I finished the book in 3 nights!<br />I hope he realizes how much the American people appreciate hearing the story of the death of the terrorist that murdered so many innocent men, women & children. I know his real name has since been released but I can't recall it nor do I need to know. The government owed us so much more than what we got from them, Mr. Owen provided it & thank him & his fellow Team 6 SEALS for a very hard & dangerous job well done.
B0096MM9GG|2.0|First I loved the Game!  the reason for only 2 stars is the controls for moving around need a lot of work.  I played this game on a PC when it first came out, and have been addicted ever since.  I was excited when I first saw the game, but quickly became FRUSTRATED when moving around the screen. If the controls improve, I'll be first in line to try and or buy the new version.<br />Tried on an Android tablet and a smart phone.
B004J4WNL2|5.0|The title is a line from a Clint Eastwood movie.<br /><br />Even as introverted and self sufficienct as I am, it can weigh me down sometimes, living in a world where the messages I hear all day say \\"Extroverts good. Introverts bad.\\" It cheers me to hear from my own tribe every now and again, from someone who understands what I feel and how I think. Susan Cain is one such voice, and an eloquent and articulate voice it is.<br /><br />Sometimes you want to go<br />Where everybody knows your name,<br />and they're always glad you came.<br />You wanna be where you can see,<br />our troubles are all the same<br />You wanna be where everybody knows<br />Your name.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|I began reading these books looking for something similar to 50 Shades of Grey.  I am very pleased.  There are enough romance and love scene similarities to satisfy that, but then plenty of new twists and turns. I can‘t help but find it ironic that Christian Grey and Gideon Cross have the same initials.
B007TBZ63Y|4.0|Summary -  4 ½ Stars. Unmissable continuation of a truly epic series with a few minor issues but successfully raises the stakes for the rest of the series.<br /><br />Mark of Athena opens with the payoff of the reunion/meeting of all our favourite demigods. There is much merriment but, being a Rick Riordan book, things quickly go to Tarturus. It isn't long before our seven Heroes (and Coach Hedge) are on their way, naturally leaving a little chaos in their wake.<br /><br />Riordan is the master of combining the mythology of the pantheons with the modern world. He knows just how to get the balance right in the individual scenes but there were just a few too many sidequests in Mark of Athena. The book did drag a little in the middle, however the final act of the book did a good job of setting up the rest of the series.<br /><br />For me, the best part was that we get scenes from Annabeth's POV, and this really is her story. She's a great hero and her personal quest was nicely done. I loved getting to see inside her head. Best of all, while it's clear that Annabeth cares about Percy, she isn't obsessed to the point of distraction and is still a badass in her own right.<br /><br />Jason and Percy's relationship was well conceived and surprisingly mature. I loved their little `bromance' moments as well as their more awkward ones. The group in general works well together and I like that - given the tension with the Legion having a big internal struggle would be too much.<br /><br />Percy always feels a little more flat than he did in the original series but it's still recognizably him. Piper and Leo were so so, with Leo being the better of the two. I guess my overall major issue was the Roman heroes were underused. The final showdown was in ROME for gods' sake! Kind of a wasted opportunity there.<br /><br />This is very much an in between book in terms of the main quest/prophecy. The twins never felt as much of a threat as the other giants. Their final battle was kind ofcool though.  You kind of wanted to slap a certain god of wine a couple of times... but that's par for the course really.<br /><br />But the ending... wow, the ending. It was beautifully built up to  and I was smiling at the sweetness of it even though it's a terrifying prospect of what's to come. Don't want to spoil anything but it definitely raised the stakes and I can't wait for the next book... due in fall 2013. Sigh.
034580404X|5.0|I loved these books. I know they are well known and many people have read them but, It was a very good read, I finished the three books within 2 weeks, couldn't put them down.
B007TMON8M|5.0|This was a lot tougher than I thought it would be.  But You really have to think like an architect.<br />Would love to see more of these.
B003VWU2WA|1.0|Worthless couldn't use it with Windows 7,  thirty dollar paper weight. I mean really Vista was dead on arrival so why and the world weren't drives written to support OS Win 7.
B007VUA7VO|4.0|I just got this phone a week ago and I love it. It does everything the new I phone 5 does. Camera is amazing and really captures the beauty of the pictures. I can not ask for a better phone. Love the style of the phone and its not to heavy and perfect size. The only thing I dont like it the battery life. Although the more you go online and play games the more battery it will use up. Dont let this stop you from buying this phone. You wont regret buying it. It is the best phone I have ever had.
B0098VYCCE|3.0|I enjoyed the special effects. Charlize Theron and Chris Hemsworth both gave great performances. The story felt like it was almost there but still did not quite cross the threshold to great. I did enjoy it and like the different spin. I do not know much about the story of snow white except what Disney and a few other productions have generated.<br /><br />It is a good rental but I would not purchase it.
B000QCS8TW|5.0|I love video and movies, and I must confess that I saw the 'Game of Thrones' first season on DVD before I starting reading the series.  As is usually NOT the case, the DVD follows the book more closely than any series I can remember, and that's a big plus now that I'm actually reading the book.  I also have a mental picture of what the characters look like from the DVD, and that helps as well.<br /><br />All that said, I still prefer the book over the movie in nearly every case.  The book has the time and space to fully develop each character, the plot, and the 'world' it is taking place in.  Martin's writing is compact and dense in plot and characterization, but not to the extent that it bogs down the story.  He makes the complexities of life as a Stark or Lannister absorbing without getting lost in verbosity. There are multiple plot threads running at the same time, yet his break points make it easy to keep track of each one without having to go back and reread to pick up the threads again.<br /><br />I already know what is coming in this first book because of the DVD, but I can't put it down because there is so much there that couldn't be transferred onto the screen.  I can't wait to move on and start on the remaining books in the series.  I highly recommend this book and the entire series.
B007RTAR64|5.0|Birthday gift for daughter,She is very happy with it. She wanted it because she has the movie, and is not opening it.<br /><br />Never had problems with orders fron Amazon.
B006LSZECO|1.0|I heard about this book on the Today show. Hoda Kotb recomended it. I had recently reviewed it and it did appeal to me.  However I decided to buy it anyway. I<br />have read 81% of this novel. I can't do another minute of this. It is now GONE GIRL GONE. I don't care how it ends. Both Amy and Nick are BORING.
B0095R64AO|3.0|for all the hype this was given i definitely feel sorry for the people that bought it ~ guess this is what everyone wants to watch these days?  amazing that this movie was over two hours long ~ even more amazing is that i watched it!
0525953728|5.0|Although I don't often read books, I was easily able to read this entire selection in two sittings. The author takes you through a full portion of his adult life in the military where he gave and received brotherly love in a rough and gritty existence as an elite fighter. His first-person account is riveting and well written. No Easy Day met and exceeded my expectations.
B003R50FRI|5.0|By far the best book i read. Such a good read and cant wait to read the sequel. Well done linbaba :)
B008JGSM6G|4.0|it is really fun. it makes you think a lot but it gets really hard almost impossible. which  makes it really fun. I would regimens it to children and adults. I think they would enjoy it greatly.
B004Q7CIFI|5.0|Great book, different take on the events of 1963.  Another King book that you don't want to put down. I read it on my Kindle and did not want the book to end.
B004I744AS|5.0|Well informed dictionary and surprisingly entertaining.  I wanted a dictionary and found a literary portal that leads from one quest to another.
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|If you read the other two Hunger Games books, you should read this one as well. However, it didn't maintain my interest as well as the others. The plot and characters are not developed as well, and their actions seemed unlikely and capricious at times.<br /><br />That said, book two left you hanging...and you'll want to wrap this story up, even if the ending isn't all that satisfying.
B000I8G5B2|5.0|I remember watching this movie when it first came out. It wasn't popular, but I must say that this is one of the best movies of our time.
B0071T4BVC|5.0|As I was growing up, after Sunday dinner at my Gran's, we would all gather around the piano and sing. My aunt would play and sing alto, My mom, who sang professionally, sang soprano, and everyone else sang somewhere in between. It was the songs on this album and others that we loved to sing. We never tired of the \\"same old thing\\" because as kids, we knew them by heart. This album is so wonderful. It takes you back to those moments...if you never had that experience growing up, then Paul croons you through the ages as he sings some of the most memorable songs from the past. You might even find yourself singing along with him...and if you do, I am sure he wouldn't mind!
B007FEFLTO|5.0|I have just started reading book and I am already hooked by its  cattching and exciting description of an era that shook the world. The settings of the political and social circumstances in which the novel places its chasacters is just as we know it from various historical narratives, making the book much more enticing. Reads as a novel and history at the same time. Kem Follet has done it again. His third book of the trilogy will become a must acquire. Let us hope he doesnt take long in writing it.
B002BI6SMI|1.0|Predictable and clumsy , there is absolutely no new ground here. A few memorable one-liners does not a whole film make. I had high hopes for Taken but in the end I came away both irritated and disappointed.
B003O86FMW|4.0|If you read the first book of this triology you must go on and read more. Each book is a<br />continuation of the preceding book. It is hard to put the books down as the stories are fast<br />moving and very adventurous. The stories are well written and very in depth.
B007Z9QWVK|4.0|I didn't think I was going to enjoy W.E., but I did!  Superb acting and  Madonna does an insightful take on one of the most publicized love stories of the last century. If you enjoyed The King's Speech you might like this one as well.A most pleasant surprise, all in all.

1475143389|5.0|This book has alot of good info. I am new to weight lifting and I enjoyed the straight fowardness of it. Mike gives you a clear cut formula on how to get in shape. I like how he gives you a great website on how to properly perform the exercises he does. I also enjoy his quick reply to my email for further questions after the book.
B008XG1X18|5.0|it was awesome and i use it evetyday!!!!!  i can't imagine my whole life with out it. you should get it.
B007GCY8FS|5.0|To my recollection, I have read every Jack Reacher novel written by Lee Child.  I have enjoyed each one.  There are books you can't wait to finish and then there are the Reacher stories you can't wait to finish, but you don't want them to end either.  Lee Child just can't write quickly enough for me.
B0090EIILU|3.0|Film was dacent. Wouldn't be falling round the place but it was better than most of the sthuff u'd sit thru of a Thursday night.
0756405890|5.0|I don't review books.  I don't write well.  However, this is the best book I have ever read, bar none!  The character's are well written and the story line grabs you from the first page!
B0054JZC6E|3.0|its ok.  it's not what I was expecting. its hard to earn points. you have play over and over. not worth it.
B007GCY8FS|5.0|I love Lee Child's \\"Reacher\\" books, I have ALL of them and can't wait for the next one. Lee makes the reader love and care about Jack Reacher and the \\"action\\" is great. If I could have 1 request to the author, 'please don't age Jack anymore' I am prepared to suspend reality as I don't want Jack to age or (Horrors) die off!.
B00992CF6W|4.0|It's fun, but it needs buckets.<br />And to that one review, there is lava but you don't see it that often.<br />Also, it needs more blocks and monsters.<br />It needs glowstones and Endermen, and more craftable/minable items.<br />Last but not least,<br />IT<br />NEEDS<br />UPDATES.<br />We need updates like in PC Minecraft.<br />It should be almost exactly like PC Minecraft, now that I think about it. Mojang, please make this game better.<br />I hope you enjoyed my review.
B008XG1X18|3.0|Seems like even if I have really strong signal Pinterest still loads super slow.  Super slow and frustrating. Also loading new pics from my i phone could be more user friendly.
B007VL7OIW|5.0|11 years after Joey's death, it's good to see people care enough about putting out classic \\"Joey Ramone\\" songs (these are not Ramones songs).  I love seeing very cool people paying homeage to him, especially his real brother Mickey Leigh, plus Tommy Ramone, Anthony Bourdain, Andrew W.K., etc...  Joey 's been gone but not forgotten, GABBA GABBA HEY, highly recommend!!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Best book ever. i never read anything like it.  awesome book cant what to start the next. so cool thanks
0062082353|1.0|The first thing I'll say is I'm glad I didn't waste money my family could benefit from in buying this piece of trash.  Too bad my brother did.  Secondly, those who consider Chris Kyle a hero must also idolize Charles Graner. How? Just doing their jobs? Psychopaths...both of them and those who give them two thumbs up. I do not recommend this book.
0446572764|4.0|A search for a serial child killer in the cold war Soviet Union could not help but be depressing, even more so because it is based on a true story. Leo, an investigator for the Soviet government for many years, knew that he had helped put to death and sent to prison many innocent people. Now through the treachery of another investigator, Leo finds himself being treated as an enemy of his own government.<br /><br />Leo has had enough and after he had to lie about the murder of a friend's child, he goes in seach of this killer. Leo is going against all his trained behavior to follow his instincts and he doesn't find out why until the end of his search.<br /><br />This is well written and I can tell that the author has done his homework. He has done it so well that the environment he described in the cold war Soviet Union really depressed and sadden me. This was a society where everyone was being watched and was under suspicion, where a serial killer could exist because the society would not admit that it could produce such a killer, and where punishment was quick and usually unjust.
B0087JTAKW|5.0|This book certainly holds your attention. It makes you think about the time you have and the choices you make. I have read all of Mitch Albom's books and this is certainly one of my favorites. It reminds me of a modern day \\"It's a Wonderful Life.\\" There is a little surprise as you near the end of the book and see where the journey of these three people go. If you want a quick read that is interesting and continually flows, you will love this book.
B007RI56NY|5.0|Love this album! It keeps you moving! I loved the tour as well! Awesome group! Looking forward to the next one.
1476715904|5.0|If you like the genre combination of YA and Romance, this is a book you need to get. Now.<br /><br />The story is about Lake (Layken) who moves from Texas to Michigan with her mother and little brother. As she backs up to their new home, she does not realise what is in store for her in her new hometown. For when she gets out of that truck she meets her new neighbour, the 21-year-old guy even her mother immediately approves of. It just happens that their suddenly formed deep emotions to each other has to be pushed aside..<br /><br />This book made me love it pretty much immediately when I started reading it. It was quite an emotional read, making me sigh out loud, snicker and laugh, tear up and I came pretty damn close to actually crying too. It was a beautiful story. It was so good that it is making me think that the basic 1-5 stars rating scale just doesn't cover it. So that is why it is 5+.<br /><br />In young adult books with romance in them the characters have a habit of falling for each other really easily and fast. Do you know what I mean? Well this book is romance and ya. But I have to say that the story in this, I really can buy it. There is something magical happening there. I really like the little brothers of the story, and I really like the main characters self-irony. I know I must often say that a book is an easy and a quick read, so I guess I have upgrade on that as well now, this was super easy and super fast. Infact, it felt pretty effortless.<br /><br />I got this book free from Netgalley for an honest review.
B007SGM084|1.0|After hearing so many favorable reviews,along with all the buzz in the media, I purchased this trilogy.  I had to force myself to finish the first book, hoping the story would get better.  Not so....I trudged through the second book and ended up skimming most of the third book. There are far better novels available than this pathetic series....buy those.
B000UZQI0Q|5.0|Quite simply, The Well of Ascension is a very good novel, and if you have read the first book in the series I can see no reason why you should stop there.<br />To start with the bad, though, is that the book is a little slow paced, more so than the first book, so if you as a reader have little tolerance for such you could get bored quickly. However, during this slow period, Sanderson shows his true genius as he manages to show the sheer difficulty of trying to create a new government with all the politics involved with his fantasy world only forming the backdrop of it all. And of course there's the occasional action scene for those of you who enjoy that kind of material, but above all I find that the complexity of the story line was really what drew me in. I don't want to spoil anything, but I can tell you that almost nothing is as it seems, and as an aspiring author myself, I can tell you that is not something entirely easy to do.
B0098VYCCE|3.0|This a dark turn even from original Snow White plots. Which I'm ok with but it was more graphic than I thought. Definitely for the more mature of 13 or older. I won't spoil anything else about this movie. Good actors. Dwarfs aren't really dwarf actors. Give the parts to the ones who fit the part

B003V5CFV8|5.0|Light hearted comedy stereotyping the south in the earlier days. So sophistication here folks. Some racial humor but plays out well. Great cast catchy theme song \\" man of constant sorrow. More for grown ups but I feel a whole family can enjoy
B0027MJU00|4.0|Very good book, with enough twists and turns to keep me reading all night long. I would recommend if you like a good thriller!
B0098VXBIA|4.0|Honestly I was coerced into watching this ' chic flick' as I call it but it was good. Doesn't sugar coat things and reviews several different ppls reactions and coping, but in a pretty funny way. Guys, if your girl wants to watch this don't worry it's got stuff for you too

B007IXWKUK|5.0|I love these books. I do not love all the drama that comes with reading the book. It is very controversial but I love them all.
B007GCY8FS|5.0|Another great Jack Reacher Novel. This is one of the best where you will get lost and involve in the action within this book.
B005GSZZ1A|5.0|It really amazes me the strength of the human spirit.  Also makes one appreciate the greatness of our country and the freedoms that we enjoy.

B0064X7FVE|3.0|Overall, pretty good app, I might have some minor quibbles with wanting more details; hourly for the next day, future radar forecast but these in no way detract from its utility overall...and hey it's free!
B007SGM084|5.0|As many have, I purchased the 50 Shades trilogy out of curiosity because it was a popular topic at work.  I was not disappointed!  With due respect for those who criticize its literary qualities (or lack thereof) I found these books to be real page turners.  Finally-a book with explicit sex that actually includes a plot!  It's an entertaining combination of romance and mystery with a very healthy dose of creative sex that transports the reader into the complicated fantasy lives of Christian and Ana.  I enjoyed the author's imaginative use of sex, juxtaposing both its destructive/transcendent qualities, as a means of deep introspection and transformation.  Who'd a thunk it?!  As an interesting side note, if what I hear around the coffee machines is any indication, these books have had a very positive influence on couple relationships!  What's to criticize in that?
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|Not as good as The Hunger Games by far. Repetitious. The style might appeal to young teens and romantic characters are too phony. There was no sex  acts or offensive language, so would be appropriate for young readers.
B007IXWL2C|1.0|Unreadable. First book was sort of interesting, mainly for all the media hype. Second was ok, as I wanted to know what happened next. Third is just don't care about the characters. It was painful to read and still remains only partially read.<br />Should have just stopped at book 2.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|I have read couple of Sylvia Day books before `Crossfire' series and found them somewhat frustrating: the story line promising at first seemed to be drugging on without clear direction, and the sex scenes were too explicit for my taste.<br />But Crossfire books, especially Reflected in you, left me in awe at writer's talent for storytelling.  All the characters in the book are utterly believable in their actions and emotions.  And everyone, from Gideon and his dysfunctional family down to police detective, who is only taking two pages of the book, are very interesting characters.<br />I love how people in the book are introduced through Eva's eyes and, like in real life, at first appear totally superficial and described through their clothes, hair styles and frozen facial expressions.  Then, as Eva gets to know those people better, and the reader gets to know Eva better, we are slowly discovering real people behind beautiful clothes.<br />And sex scenes in this book are so closely connected to the plot that removing or `diluting' content of even one of those intimate moments would tear the storyline apart.  Both Eva and Gideon are using sex as a communication tool, and Sylvia Day is using sex scenes as a way to communicate characters emotions and reactions to unfolding events.  After reading `Crossfire' books I have total understanding and appreciation of Sylvia's writing style and will definitely re-visit or buy her other books.<br />Bravo, Sylvia.  You have a new fan.
B008Z9YLV2|1.0|Terrible movie overhyped slow moving they hacked apart the book waste of money. hard to follow real bad script and the casting was terrible. the only actor worth a salt was donald Sutherland and he had a bit part. LOUSY!
1476712042|3.0|I don't know if this is due to generation gap, or simply due to writer's deficiency... why do I feel like those people grew up on an uninhabited island with no adults in sight?<br />The book is full of characters with such strong emotions.  And they forget about those emotions and events that caused them in just couple of hours.  It was an effort to ignore this incongruence through the book, but the ending just knocked down all my hard work to tune into mindset of generation `N' (narcissistic).<br />People dye in fire.  As described in the book: 'lot of people'.  Police is looking for those responsible.  And our smoked main characters are devastated.  For the whole 2 hours.  And then they go to Las Vegas and don't mention the fire incident ever again.<br />I do hope this is due to bad writing...
B008ASLK8A|3.0|I thought this better than the first one but there is still something lacking, and if you try to watch this without having watched the first film you will possibly get lost as they do not fill you in.
B000MD7OKY|5.0|This movie is soooo great! It's Grant and Kelly at their coolest. The scenery is beautiful,the people are beautiful and the comedy is tongue-in-cheek chic.I could write all day, and never say more. It's GREAT!!!
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|With all the hoopla currently surrounding this series I had to give it a shot. The Amazon price pretty much matched the offer from the Science Fiction Book Club of which I have been a member since high school (I'm 60 yrs old now) so I took a shot. And found an incredible hypothesis for a possible future. A mix of ancient Roman and feudal culture for North America as seen through the eyes of a young girl caught in its sinister nets. So far, an engaging read and a must for apocalyptic sf fans.
B0097S0TM0|5.0|This is one great album.  I fell in love with it quickly and reccomend it to any Pink lovers.  There are some touching songs that will pull on your heart strings and make you think.

B007IXWKUK|4.0|This is the second book of the trilogy and better than the first. Still contains an abundance of sexual encounters but there is a little more plot.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|Best book I have read in a long time. I think it should be a must read for teens. It's a modern day classic with page turning genius.
B007FEFLTO|4.0|I had been eagerly waiting for this since I finished the first book in the Century Trilogy.  Although I thoroughly enjoyed it, it did not grip me and entice me to \\"sneak read\\" as the first book did.  Follett did an excellent job of tying the two books together so that I remembered the story line of the first book, but at the same time, he didn't overdo it,as some writers do.  I only gave this book 4 stars because it seemed to lack a little bit on the history side and dealt more with the novel side.  I am looking forward to this third book though.
B007URVZJ6|3.0|This was a good tool to help publish my first Kindle book, giving me the basics of using the website. It also has good formatting information, to present the best displaying of my story.  However, some details were just given, without a more thorough explanation that would have been useful (ex. the difference in royalties and which works best in a situation/is preferred).  Some more details included in this book could make it a much better tool to use.
B0052RDHTM|4.0|Always enjoy Follett's works.  Very well written.  But, this one is a bit obtuse and certainly requires the reader's careful attention to follow the events of all the characters.  Certainly not as bad as Tolstoy, but maybe a \\"character map\\" at front would help with the \\"who is who\\"  in this book.
B008XG1X18|5.0|super neat.. better than the stuff you can find at wallmart hehe way more stuff on one page than all of they're isles at wallmart deffinately lollipop

B008MG1E4A|5.0|Very intense book, but one I could not put down until I finished it!  Learned some things I never knew about the Navy Seals.
B002AOWXQ8|5.0|This is just my opinion, but the \\"home\\" song makes you feel all warm and fuzzy inside. The rest of the cd kinda has the same hippy vibe to it.  The video is even better just because it's different than what you see today.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|This tells the story truthfully not the spin the government places upon a great episode in American history.  The glory goes to the seals not the administration.

B000N2HBSO|5.0|A really great read. I felt the book provided insight into the backgrounds of a group of individuals who came together under a magnificent leader at a dire time.
B008673ZAQ|3.0|Okay, so Sylvia Day blew me away with Bared to You, and Reflected was one of my most-anticipated releases for the fall.  I couldn't wait to dive back into Gideon and Eva's intense relationship to see how they were going to get past all of the (MANY) skeletons in their closets.  While it wasn't the mind-blowing whirlwind of steaming hot torment I was hoping it would be, this was an okay read that I hope is a lead-in to some big things for the third book.<br /><br />Reflected primarily concentrates on four basic principles:<br /><br />-Gideon and Eva having LOTS of sex (and WOW...It. Was. HOT!)<br />-Gideon hiding his feelings and being an overbearing jerk, while not concerning himself with how it affects Eva<br />-Heart-wrenching bouts of justified jealousy and the resulting crushing blow on Eva's emotions<br />-A few tender moments thrown in between, along with some pointless therapy<br /><br />I'm not breaking it down like that to be negative, but this is just essentially what happens repeatedly all throughout the story, up until the very end when we finally get some answers and realize (at least partially) why Gideon was being such an ass. So here's my issue; I LOVED the steamy scenes. Day really outdid herself this time around with several moments that had my pulse skyrocketting (that post-concert limo scene...YUMMERS)!!!  But at some point, there needed to be something behind all of the great, intense, mind-numbing sex.  I mean, even Day recognizes this point in the story, she has them talk about how their relationship needs to be more than just sex!!!  It was this never-ending cycle of no real substance, and it was just so monotonous. What I was hoping for and entirely expected was some real development in their relationship; sweet dates out on the town, moments where they kick back and enjoy something fun together, nights at home snuggling while they talked about something...ANYTHING. Take for example the adorable, sexy email banter that we all loved so much between Ana and Christian in Fifty Shades. Even something that trivial added into the story made them seem like a real couple that could simply enjoy each other, even with all the mess in their lives.  We don't get any of that here, and it really made their relationship feel lacking, much to Eva's agreement.<br /><br />I wanted so badly for Eva to walk away...REALLY walk away, so that Gideon would finally get it.  I don't know what happened to the Gideon I fell so hard for in Bared, because he wasn't here in this book until the very end.  The cocky, sexy alpha-male went all coldhearted angry dom on us, and I really missed the sweet seduction that made me melt in Bared.  There's one really dramatic twist that seems to make him fully understand, followed by an emotion-filled section of the story that I loved.  But then Gideon does a complete 180 all over again!  As much as I wanted Eva to get a backbone, I couldn't help but feel sorry for her after the yo-yo act  Gideon put her through. I wanted him to experience gut-wrenching emotional pain for what she had to feel!  We do eventually discover what was behind his final \\"assholery\\", but at that point it was just too much.  That section of the book would have been the perfect heart-crushing torment that I love in a great romance, if it weren't for the multiple boomerang moments prior.<br /><br />I'm really not trying to bash this book; I'm giving it 3 out of 5 stars because I did enjoy it more than I disliked it. I was virtual high-fiving Eva a few times when she told Gideon where he could shove it, and I was very happy that it drove him mad!!  And of course the chemistry between Gideon and Eva is clearly off-the-charts, and I love the intensity of it.  Some of the dramatic twists were great; the addition of Eva's ex Brett and his determination to win her over  really put some excitement into the storyline, and like I said, I really loved the heartbreaking lead into the ending.  I am such a sucker for stories that have that intense jealousy and world-crushing heartbreak, and Day wrote it to perfection here.  I remain hopeful that with the next book we will finally get to the core of Gideon's past so he can let go and truly love Eva, because this series started out too good to end up a disappointment.

B001BANK32|5.0|Now I understand.  Can not wait til next September. It is true that the Film did not do the text justice.  The story is far deeper than a man that tries to kill his family.  I was particularly intrigued at the thread of time travel and continuity of time in the story.

B007HGPBRC|4.0|About 10 months ago I was diagnosed with esophageal cancer. Shortly after receiving my medical reposts, I read of Mr. Hitchen's passing. When the book was released. it was a must read for me. The book gave a most realistic assessment of the travels one may take when combatting the disease. The style and content of the writing were on target. I would recommend \\"Mortality\\" to anyone, but even more so, to those exposed to esophageal cancer.
B0071BGOJC|5.0|this book kept me spellbound . I had a hard time putting it down during work hours I sneaked a page or two in order to satisfy my curiosity about what happens at the next page

B0074D3CAQ|3.0|The novel was easy to read. I was disappointed in the lack of description of the countryside and thought that the characters were drawn in such a way that they were difficult to relate to or like. Mr. Fry's \\"pilgrimage\\" culminated in questionable benefit to anyone in the story.

B005ZO6NRA|2.0|Momoa cant hold a candle to Schwarzenegger in this movie(size wise).  He is too skinny, and its very evident in his lack of arm size.  Hardly any tricep muscles.  Also, his goofy facial expressions made him look like Brendan Fraser ala the Mummy.  The music score is just bland, lacks power and emotion of the original.  WAY too much CGI,  the cartoony sand monsters were laughable.  The villian was pretty ho hum boring.  They should have had him dubbed by James Earl Jones. Weak movie.. watched it once, and have no intentions of watching it again, or any sequels.  Reboot?  No, just boot this to the trash can.  :)
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|This is such an awesome game! You'll be up playing for hours. I can't wait until the next one comes out!!
B0036TGSR6|4.0|The ghost in this movie is Ruth Lang who arranges the engagement of a replacement ghost writer to the former ghost writer of her husband's memoirs, to keep it unlikely that her role as a ghost-in-the-machine, CIA mole, remains undiscovered. Ewan McGregor plays the man-with-no-name ghost writer who replaces Mike McAra, the dead--apparently from suicide--former ghost writer, Downing Street aide and friend to former British Prime Minister Adam Lang.<br /><br />The movie is technically excellent and clearly demonstrates the capabilities of European cinema. This movie may appear somewhat slight, but it is much more substantial than it seems. Roman Polanski (in the special features section) says that this is a movie for adults. True enough, so long as the demography of the adults, does not extend beyond the borderline juvenile.<br /><br />That sniping, aside, Roman Polanski and writing partner Robert Harris, could have added substantially more beef, beyond that which was barely alluded to (the brief discussion between Adam Lang and the ghost writer on the short flight back to Island, just before Adam Lang is assassinated)), without too much extra effort. The dialogue is mostly plain vanilla, but this may be necessary to avoid complications when translated into German, etc.<br /><br />Other commentators have complained about Ewan McGregor's British accent. He sounded quite like the writer and broadcaster Tony Parsons, to me.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|my husband &amp; I both have this and are in competition.  it is just fun boardwalk type game.  you can purchase more coins but do not need to.  the coins regenerate quickly.

B00933ZB0E|3.0|The plot is plausible and mostly realistic.  However, the writers missed realism with the character of the lead gal, who appears educated, intelligent, and focused.  People like that don't have a gutter mouth vocabulary as they portray her.  The profanity is unnecessary and completely out of character for a person who is a real thinker.  Those kinds of people don't need trash words to make their point.  They have access to better and more descriptive ways to convey their feelings and ideas.  So, it was a huge disappointment in that respect.  Otherwise, pretty good show.

B0084IG8TM|5.0|I've reviewed the insanely popular book The Hunger Games in both written and video form. The video review still continues to be one of the most viewed on YouTube and is one of my most viewed videos. That just says something about how a story can have so much of an impact. The film version of the first book of the series was sure to be a success with an already astounding fan base, so I was quite eager to check it out. Luckily, I was able to get press access to an early screening of this one (yay me!), which made it all the more exciting.<br /><br />The film is directed by Gary Ross, which was a surprising choice for me. He's most known for films like Seabiscuit and Pleasantville, so I was unsure how he'd handle such an over-the-top production that the material called for. He ended up being a fine choice however, as the book's fantastical futuristic and post-apocalyptic world was translated perfectly onto the screen. The writing is also done by Ross, with the book's author Suzanne Collins and Billy Ray contributing to the screenplay. The follows very closely to the book, which was certainly a wise choice in order to not upset the already huge group of book fans that were guaranteed to purchase a ticket.<br /><br />The Hunger Games follows 12 districts which formerly made up North America, now known as Panem. Panem is run by a totalitarian government known as the Capitol. Each year the Capitol reminds the citizens of their control by holding the Hunger Games, a fight-to-the-death survival competition featuring a boy and girl chosen at random from each district. The concept may sound similar, as the idea has been done in many other books and movies, however The Hunger Games still does manage to be unique enough to hold its own. There have been constant comparisons to other certain titles, however I find such comparisons pointless as the characters and world Collins created are original and interesting.<br /><br />The story centers on 16 year old Katniss Everdeen (Jennifer Lawrence) of the rustic and impoverished District 12. During the Reaping, or selection ceremony for the tributes that will represent the district in the games, Katniss' younger sister Prim (Willow Shields) gets chosen. Without a second thought, Katniss throws herself forward and volunteers to take Prim's place. The boy chosen is Peeta Mellark (Josh Hutcherson), and shortly after the two head towards the Capitol for their training where they are introduced to a world unlike anything they have seen in their village.<br /><br />The Capitol was where most of my worries about the film adaptation existed. The futuristic world called for technology that doesn't exist and wild clothing and hairdos (and skindos), which I wasn't sure if they'd be able to match my imagination's interpretation. However I was pleasantly surprised at the film's ability to capture the book's descriptions nearly perfectly. Not that I deny the ability of the talented individuals that have churned out some breathtaking effects and designs over the past several years, but it's tough I think for a film to match what most people picture when reading the book. In this case, I think they nailed it.<br /><br />Once the games actually kick off, the excitement doesn't let up. For fans of survival adventure movies such as myself, the film is a treat. There's an excellent display of survival techniques and tactical scenarios. While the film does don a PG-13 rating, there is also a surprising amount of violence involved. The story, after all, does involve kids killing kids, but the film is impressively able to pull of some of the more gruesome scenes without exploiting the gore and carnage. The action scenes are adrenaline-filled, which is good but could also give some viewers motion sickness. The camera work is fast, moving right along at the pace of the action. I liked the style at times, but the shaky cam also did hinder the detail of some of the combat scenes.<br /><br />The pacing of the film also works both in favor of and against the movie. At over 2 hours long, it feels much shorter. Because of this, however, many scenes that in the book were very emotional and significant seemed very much rushed past in the film, placing more attention to the action. I understand there's a lot of ground to cover with the story, and in order to keep it to one part they had to do a bit of cramming, but a few pivotal scenes were either ignored or barely touched on which was a disappointment.<br /><br />Being highly impressed with Lawrence in Winter's Bone, I knew she would tackle the role of Katniss with ease and she certainly did. I'm not usually too impressed with Josh Hutcherson, but I felt he did well as Peeta. The rest of the cast was just perfect, from Woody Harrelson as the drunken mentor Haymitch, to the always impressive Stanley Tucci as Caesar Flickerman. The colorful characters were represented well, and I felt like the actors really brought each one to life.<br /><br />The film overall is a great example of a book adaptation done well. There may have been a few things I would have liked to have seen, but it captures a huge amount of detail in a relatively short time that seems to go by without notice. With the Games' impressive arena, full of manipulated nature and engineered animals, combined with a perfect cast and action that never lets up once it gets started, I can imagine without having read the book there really wouldn't be a lot to be unimpressed with. While the books may be popular with the female teen audience, due to its empowering heroine, this is a matured teen survival adventure flick that adults of both sexes can enjoy.<br />Source: criticnic.com 28-July-2012s both in favor of and against the movie.

B0080QOLCE|4.0|The Faculty is one I missed when it originally came out in 1998, and man does 7th grade CriticNic wish he hadn't. The exaggerated high-school scene is darkly comical and the alien action is wildly entertaining and a bit cheesy. Definitely the kind of fun sci-fi horror flick that I enjoy. The Blu-ray looks great, but this one is without subtitles as with many of the Echo Bridge releases which is one negative for me (being hard of hearing).<br />Source: criticnic.com 28-July-2012<br />Disclosure: Film sent by Echo Bridge Home Entertainment
0525953728|5.0|I got the book in perfect condition, broke it out and had it read in two days! I couldn't put the book down and had to pound some Ambien (like our hero in the book) just to sleep! Of course, I didn't face his next-day battles, just my own paltry ones...<br /><br />The book kept me on the edge of my couch.
B001EBV0OY|5.0|Redemption says it all.  This is a feel good movie in the sense that you see a bad guy get what he deserves, and others redeemed.
B005HSL626|1.0|this app freezes right when it opens on the opening screen and closes with being able to do anything about it.
B000DZIGDU|5.0|Great movie the acting was top notch.  The service was the best I actually got Jarhead two days earlier than expected.
B005FISBTO|2.0|We eagerly inserted disc one in our blue ray player.  After the annoying commercials for Showtime, we found the symbol for DISC ERROR at the top of our screen.<br />We tried the same disc several times and consistently got the same performance.  Discs 2, 3, and 4 seem to work properly.  We then tried Disc One on our laptop<br />computer and it seems to play properly.
B004SD5GZ4|3.0|The adobe reader program is one i hve used since the 1980's but i mussay on the kindle fire is a good application. It does need some improvements like wrorking better with the kindle's book features of marking pages and moving within the document. But overall I think this this program is very good and I would recomend it
B000MKD9P6|5.0|One of the best movies that has a love story, career story and excellent acting all around, this one will keep you interested and holds up well during multiple viewing.  We bought it because we've seen it three or four times already, and wanted to have it in our permanent collection.  Priced low and in Blu-Ray you can't go wrong with this one!!
B008B1VYP0|5.0|I don't know why I love this CD.  The songs?  Adam Levine?  Both?  It's both!!<br /><br />This CD is the only one that I have had playing for the last month.  But now I've pinpointed my favorites, which are:<br /><br />One More Night: It makes me want to dance every time I hear it.  Great beat, great lyrics, easy to get into.<br /><br />Payphone: I hate rap but decided to get the explicit version anyway.  Love it!  Constantly on repeat.<br /><br />Daylight: This is a little subtle compared to the other two above and it's really growing on me.  It's a smooth ballad that's catchy and fun to sing.<br /><br />I do like the other songs but the three above are in constant rotation for now.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|excellent read, did not want to put book down, I hope she writes more books like this trilogy.  Read all three books in a month
B00999VI0Y|5.0|While [[ASIN:B008EL58YA CoolStream Bluetooth Receiver for iPhone Dock.]] and [[ASIN:B0094G44PS Patuoxun Bluetooth A2DP Music Audio Receiver Adapter ]] did not work for Bose Sound dock and iphone 4s linking. This product worked! Glad I ordered it.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I loved the authors use of words, great descriptions and imagery. It was a suspenseful read and the plot usually never turned out the way you assumed it would as it thickens... I was hooked with all three books, only put it down to sleep and go to work....
B008K7WCJM|5.0|but it's no exaggeration of how I feel.<br /><br />In all honesty, this may be the most important album I've come across in years. 'The Seer' is one of those all too rare instances where music goes beyond itself. When I listen to this, I forget the headphones on my ears, I forget about the musicians, and I forget about the idea of music itself. All that's left is the experience, a shuddering, ecstatic meltdown.<br /><br />This is not an album. Michael Gira and co. have opened a sonic door to the deepest reaches of the human brain, where the ghosts of your childhood are waiting. And they still remember you.<br /><br />It's as strange and beautiful as anything you'll find on this planet.
1451648537|5.0|i never read this book by now but i feel i need to spend some time on it. in fact i'm too busy with other things and read the electronic verion over my Kindle. so this hard copy is just kept for future reading.
B002R5NL34|5.0|Extremely well written, superbly acted show.<br />I always feel good after watching any episode.<br />Do yourself a favor and check<br />It out.
B000ZHCQ5U|4.0|I had never watched this movie before but saw it on a list of \\"must see\\" movies.  I found the satirical commentary interesting and felt like it was a time capsule back to a different time.  Peter Seller's various character portrayals kept the movie lively and it was interesting to see him switch between his roles.  I rented this movie using Amazon unbox through my Tivo and had no problems with playback or picture quality.
B001HNE3NO|4.0|Sarah's Key is a good story and kept my interest throughout. It's a bit sad in parts, but that's real life, isn't it.
0316228532|5.0|I read this book in audiobook format:<br /><br />What I liked about this book:  I loved the vividness of the characters; the story was absorbing; loved the way the individual stories were very individual yet they all intertwined; author did not give into the temptation to have a \\"feel good\\" ending; the narrator (reader) was fantastic; liked that each individual story followed all the way through the book and there was an individual ending for each character/family's story.<br /><br />I was a big Harry Potter fan and when you break Harry Potter down into the basic story it is a very gritty, dark tale. I found it no surprise that this was also a very gritty, dark tale. I found that I could clearly see the characters and that their actions were believable and authentic.<br /><br />Wish for the audiobook format: I'm sure there are all kinds of copyright issues, but it would have been great to play the Rihanna song at the appropriate place in the book. I just downloaded and listened to it and it would have been a powerful asset.
B002O3Z4QQ|1.0|Ordered \\"From the Earth to the Moon (2005)\\" from amazon because the description said \\"1.33:1\\" aspect ratio.<br />Be aware before you buy this version, that it is NOT in the original 1.33:1 aspect ratio as originally produced and broadcast.<br />The top and the bottom of the image has been removed to make it 1.78:1 or \\"16x9 wide screen\\". I'm very disappointed.  This is a great series, but I don't like being lied to in the amazon product description.
B000000XBC|5.0|This CD was exactly what I requested.  We enjoy Creedence Clearwater Revival  and this  has all the great classics we remember and wanted. We always have enjoyed good results from Amazon.
B00136JSV2|5.0|Dylans \\"the times they are a changing\\" harkens back to a time when a musician could record an album with just a guitar, harmonica and his voice as the only instruments in the recording. Something which would probably not be possible today, at least as far as main stream music is concerned.  Back then musicians were truly artists. They recorded what they were inspired to do, not just to sell records but to create music that would inspire them and listeners as well. That said this is truly an exceptional album with some great songs! In my opinion this was Dylan's best period. His playing is at its best and his lyrics are thought provoking. There are some political songs but there is also \\"boots of spanish leather\\" one of my all time favs. But if you are not a fan of singer/songwriters (of which Dylan might have been among the first) then this is not for you. If you are a fan of great lyrics and great playing then by all means buy it!
B004J4WLB4|5.0|Despite its title, this book is not for the faint-hearted.  The main character will infuriate you and break your heart.  But the beauty of the writing and the imagery of the flowers will make it all worthwhile.  This may be one of the best books I've ever read.
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|Once you start playing, you can't stop. I find myself just tapping away despite having no coins. I've no patience &amp; the 30 seconds it takes for just 1 coin is torturous!
B0061PEAUY|5.0|Excellent read...easy to read,intriguing, analytical and one of Kathy Reichs best books.<br />I tried a sample and was hooked after 2 chapters.<br />From previous books I thought I could predict the ending, but was pleasently surprised.<br />I want to read her next and see if the relationship between Tempe and Ryan takes off<br />again.....
B007MB5OCE|4.0|Reading The 100 Year Old Man was very entertaining and just plain cute.  Its like a history lesson, survival novel and cute story all in one.  Enjoyed the read and would recommend it to anyone reading for light entertainment.
B0076NKNLA|5.0|[[ASIN:B005QVUZG2 My Week With Marilyn]]<br /><br />The movie story is based on a real novel that a British film documentary producer wrote about the time he spent with Marilyn Monroe when she was in England shooting a movie with Lawrence Olivier, a famous British actor. The acting and direction were very good.
B007VUA7VO|4.0|this app has saved me from bottoming my battery out.  I charge it 2 times a day.  it also charges very fast when using during recharging..
B007GCY8FS|4.0|Always a great read and gives rise to doing for yourself-solutions.  You never know what will happen next and what the next coincidence will be.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Couldn't put it down, it was an easy read and it felt like I wanted to be a part of the story.
B0086700CM|5.0|I love this game its fun to play it but I cant play it any more because I don't have the game but I played in my mom 's phone but that's it. ;)
B00632HWOG|5.0|Great app for Yahoo email.. Made getting my mail on my kindle fire so much easier. Really easy to use, and functions excellent.
B004UJAOLM|5.0|Passion, hate, love, action, horror - a great story by a great writer. It brought tears to my eyes, which doesn't happen to me often.
B003F44QRQ|5.0|I rented this movie because my son had never seen it. I already love it and now he does too. Who doesn't love a good scary (and funny) movie. Over time, for me, the scariness has warn off, but my son thought it was awesome. A new generation enjoying an old classic is good stuff. The HD quality of the film was excellent & looked fantastic on my television. We had no problems with buffering, connection, or tiling while watching. The sound quality was great as well. I would, of course, recommend the movie. But I would also recommend Amazon HD video streaming.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|love me the Evernote!  I use it all the time.  Skitch is pretty handy too!  Handy for snapping photos, making lists, or just capturing studd in general.  This is a home page kind of app.
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|it is a fun game where u need to knock off coins to get more coins to knock off more coins. very confusing I know its definitely worth getting.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|This is a very well written story that you won't easily forget. It's a very human story and I recommend it to those who don't normally consider themselves fans of ScienceFiction. I am anxious to read book 6 because even though this omnibus edition does have a satisfying ending, you still want to know more about what happens to this world. You won't regret getting this one and it was even better than most of the Kindle editions I've read in that there weren't too many editing mess-ups in this one. It flowed smoothly and I greatly enjoyed it!
B00866H7SS|1.0|I bought 'Bared to you' after reading 50 Shades of Grey.  I'm sorry, but I did not enjoy it at all.  Will not be buying any more Sylvia Day books. E.L. James had received some pretty bad reviews on her style of writing.  I went back and reread 50 Shades instead of Bared to You.  There is no way that the two can be compared. 50 Shades is far superior.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|I need to learn to wait until an entire series is published so I don't have to wait for the next book to come out!<br /><br />Exciting story with natural progressions of our favorite character's personalities and relationships.<br /><br />I'll enjoy it even more when the publisher fixes the corrupted files so that it doesn't crash on the kindle fire and fire hd (I had that happen in two locations-one roughly in the middle, the other in the Glossary). I‘ll reread when it's fixed....and while I wait for The House Of Hades.
B0071MQBX0|5.0|We were fortunate to see this musical at Her Majestys Theatre in London this past June and loved it.  The DVD was a great reminder of how much we enjoyed the live performance.
B003O86FMW|5.0|this book was a wonderful way to end the series.some parts are slow but the end just blows your mind as well as other parts in the book! fav series ever read.
B0099G4Y26|5.0|P!nk hasn't lost a thing. Definitely an album for adults, not kids. My favorite song is Here Comes the Weekend with Eminem. Great album.
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|This is a port of a PC game, and has a few flaws because of that. One of the most glaring is the effect in the hidden object scenes because they are stretched to widescreen. Nonetheless, this game is just so much fun to play that it still deserves five stars. Wow. It's a bit like participating in a creepy mystery movie. The storyline makes sense and the puzzles are well designed.
B002APU580|5.0|Everyone knows that this is a book that transcends the ages. These characters come to life because of the actors who protray them. When I watched the movie I felt what they felt and rejoiced right along with them.  What else could someone hope from a few hours of enjoyment.
B00127RAJY|4.0|Let me start by saying that I SUCK at exercising. My usual protocol is to go gung-ho for a month or two, then get busy and forget to exercise for weeks on end. Then I remember how important physical activity is, put is off, eat a bunch of junk, watch movies, browse the internet, then decide to hop back on the bandwagon.<br /><br />I've never completed all 30 days of the Shred (I maxed out at about 16 days), but I aspire to finish it eventually.<br /><br />Jillian is much more likable here than on The Biggest Loser and I sort of, almost, enjoy the first workout, though I can't do pushups to save my life. The first day or two of doing the Shred I feel sickish, almost vomity, then a pleasant soreness, and then just good after I do it. This is the first workout I've done where my lower abs actually hurt afterward, which I consider a good thing.<br /><br />I tried workout #2 once and it was too much for me (for context, I am a thin, seemingly fit 43-year-old mom). Jillian calls people like me fat-skinny people and it couldn't be more true. Thin but not toned.<br /><br />If you have some stick-to-itveness and are more motivated than I am, this is a great program. 3 minutes strength training, 2 minutes cardio and 1 minute abs seems very well-thought-out. I just wish I were more GI Jane and less couch-potato Angie. Maybe someday.
B007GCY8FS|5.0|Lee Childs is one of my favorite authors.  I thought the book was great and was a fast read.  I am waiting to see what other fans think.
B007GCY8FS|4.0|I thought the book had an excellent plot and felt it was well developed.  I did think however it got slow about half way through which is somewhat uncharacteristic for a Child book.  I'm a big fan of the Reacher series and would put this effort in the top third of those I have read.
0060887966|5.0|A classic story. This hard copy was beautifully bound and illustrated.  I recommend to buy it.  I listen to the CD and got the hard copy.  I was surprised by the quality of this hard copy.
B005BX3NAA|5.0|Love this CD and every song on it.  Sweet Child of Mine is one of my favorite songs! Easy to order and the CD came quickly.  Highly recommend it!
0375831002|5.0|The book was one of the best book I have read, it shows a different prospective profile of survivors from WWII.
B004UID2LC|4.0|Its an easy way to watch you tube videos. Although watching videos on a little iphone screen can be interesting..

B007GCY8FS|3.0|i have read all Jack Reacher books and i guess material runs short after awhile but this book was not so good for me i almost stopped reading it 3/4 thru but i plodded on, when finished i wished i had stopped at the 3/4 mark
B00913DPW2|2.0|For me,the game was so difficult that it was more frustrating than entertaining. I definitely would give credit to anyone who has conquered the game. I got impatient and lost interest.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I love this app. The only issue is sometimes it take a little longer to open. Once open its fine. Very cool app. Tons of really neat ideas. Some fantastic photos. Very addictive!  Get it!
B0087JTAKW|5.0|Mitch Albom has done it again.  This story provides much to ponder for the mind and the soul.  A great read.
B008XG1X18|5.0|this app is amazing! I use it everyday and recommend it to everyone. locks up from to time but it fixes itself if you give it time and are patient.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Solitaire is what is expected in a solitaire app.  The app has different card backs as expected. Really the only downside is the flip up of different variations of card games available to purchase ie. free cell or spider solitaire but Skip is available and it only happens between games so no big deal unless you get irritated with any ads but for the price,  deal with it or carry a deck of cards. Otherwise it's solitaire as expected. Enjoy!
B000ZMVAXO|5.0|Just what i need to rock the streets . perfect for rockin with your favorite music.<br />If you dont want to bother or be bothered by anyone . This is it
B003L5H25W|5.0|Wonderful songs. Particularly taken by \\"Title 5\\", not a lot of instrumental Stones songs out there. Always nice to find little surprises.
B005KJ6ECY|1.0|So I ordered this collection thinking that even though it was a UK import (I'm in the US) that it would still work.  Well I was completely wrong.  I spent $48 for this and it won't work in either my blue ray player or my DVD player.  It keeps coming up saying \\"Regional Code Error\\" and it did not specify in the description that I may encounter this issue.  Now that I have to send it back I have to pay for the postage and they will not credit me back for the amount of postage on top of the price I paid for it.  When in fact it was their mistake for not letting it be known that regional difference and errors may occur.  I advise, if you are in the US, DO NOT purchase this product!!!!
B008Z9YLV2|4.0|The movie was very good. If I had \\"not\\" have read the book I would have rated 5 stars.  Many things that I thought were important in the book were not addressed or addressed differently in the film.
B009329ZF2|5.0|If you just want to turn off the brain and watch some good shots of a WWII battleship, and are a fan of the game then you will enjoy this movie.  If however you are looking for a high quality plot with great acting then you might want to skip this movie.  The only two real saving graces are Liam Nieson and Riana always looks good and doesn't act that bad either.  Sorry about the spelling of the actors.
B005EI86JU|5.0|Fantastic book! Answers most all of the camera questions you could have. Also gives you his own recommendations. It helps you to set up all the functions of the camera.
B0092MKTL2|5.0|I have really enjoyed listening to this group. I hope they make a second album very soon, I would love to hear more from them!
B007UPNA6Y|1.0|This book is dull boring and full of cliches. I have never read a Lee Child book before and never will again.
B008MEM24S|5.0|My husband and I both downloaded this app and race each other to see who can get done first! We love Perry and my daughter has finally agreed!
0525953728|3.0|I just don't see what all the flak about giving away secrets is for. to me it just reads like a action shoot 'em up. good,fast insider's blow by blow ride along. but,a national security risk? not likely.
1451696191|5.0|I adored this book. Charlie's voice in his letters to a nameless friend absolutely sucked me in, and I finished the whole book in about two hours. I was able to relate to a lot of the things Charlie went through. I wish there was a beautiful and poetic way of expressing just how much I loved this book, but there really isn't. I would absolutely recommend it.
B005LY7OSG|3.0|I really like a few of the songs, however, as an album I would rate it a 7 out of 10.
B004F1F32A|5.0|This was a great movie. Liam Neeson is a good action movie actor. I will be seeing the sequel. Hope it is as good.
B007L3BMGA|2.0|This book comes with so much anticipation but unfortunately did not live up to its reputation. There was a feeble attempt at a real story line, minimal character development and frankly poorly written. The author repeats herself using the same phrases over and over and doesn't seem to be in touch (characters in their twenties refer to each other as Mr Grey and Miss Steel...oh please). At times I had some 'yeah right' moments through the authors' depiction of their sexual exploits (men I assure you woman are not this orgasmic!). Simply 50 shades of yawn! If you need to spice up your imagination pick up a Playboy magazine....its a better read!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|You can see why he is so messed up!!!!!  I Love this book & it was a great read!!!!!  Keep reading!!!!!
B007GCY8FS|5.0|Once one has read a Lee Child/Jack Reacher book, expectations run very high.  Wanted Man met and exceeded all expectations, as usual.  It seemed that much of the story takes place in a car (or cars)which is unusual, except when Child puts Reacher behind the wheel.  As usual, many bodies begin to pile up, but most are the bad guys, eliminated in Reacher style. Very good Kindle read for me.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Loved Every minute of this book well the whole series to be exact!  It was a really good read!  Loved the story line!!!!!!
B002U3CCF6|3.0|The plot is too similar to Agatha Christie's \\"Crooked House\\" but a fairly interesting read otherwise.. I prefer her other books.
B00846REIS|5.0|I Loved Fifty Shades of Grey & still do but hands down you can't get any better than Gideon Cross & Eva!  Sylvia Day has done an outstanding job on this book & I couldn't wait until crosstober to get the second book to find out what was going on with them.  Now I can't wait until Dec.31 for the final book.  I Love that I can reread them.  If you like Fifty Shades of Grey Trilogy, you will definitely like this trilogy!  Enjoy your books as much as I have!
B007ZXK08C|4.0|The author's ability to describe different viewpoints was excellent. The book kept me riveted right through.  I look forward to reading her next book.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I have read these books over & over & I did not want the story to end!  I Loved every minute of these books!!!!!!!!!!!
0525953728|5.0|I'll be honest. I haven't read the book yet although it arrived surprisingly fast. I pre-ordered before the release date and had it within 2 days of that date. I will read it, but mostly I ordered it because the hateful, ball-spiking sociopaths in the White House tried to stop the sale of this book. In that respect it has exceeded my expectations.[[ASIN:0525953728 No Easy Day: The Firsthand Account of the Mission That Killed Osama Bin Laden]]
B005NHQ2NY|5.0|Well, it works!  There are very contradicting information about the high protein way of eating.  Many physicians prescribe it to patients and at the same time others are against it.  I know quite a number now who lives successfully eating this way.  Atkins is natural and easy to do.
B008476HBM|5.0|THERE IS A REASON FOR THIS BOOK BEING A CLASSIC. IT IS A CHARACTER STUDY PAR EXCELLENCE!!!!EVEN THOUGH THE HABITS AND MORES OF 18 CENTURY ENGLAND WERE QUITE DIFFERENT FROM OURS, THE HUMANITY OF THE PEOPLE ARE THE SAME.<br />THE TITLE TELLS THE STORY---2 PEOPLE EACH DENOTING THE CHARACTER TRAITS GIVEN THEM IN THE TITLE--AND HOW THEY FINALLY COME TO A MEETING OF THE MIND AND HEART.<br />THIS BOOK IS TO BE ENJOYED MANY TIMES OVER!!!
B003Y3D9C6|5.0|This is my second pair of these sandals (my first pair is brown.)  This style is so comfortable I can wear them anywhere, even walking my dog.  In addition to being comfortable they are cute.  I usually run around the house barefooted and these shoes are just as comfortable.  Love the newer styles of Crocs - the clogs, etc. are so ugly I would not have even considered giving them a try.<br />The black color on the shoe top is a little odd (almost brownish-grey.)
B007ZD17XO|4.0|Enjoyed this game but I finished it pretty quick.  Would like the game to have more chapters to work on.  Skill levels were good.<br />patsy
B003Q6CUAI|4.0|I found the diet to be interesting and well explained and have followed it with success.My advice to anybody that wanted to download it would be to do it on the computer or pad as it is quite difficult to page back and forward on the kindle.perhaps because min is an older version.Well written and well explained I still felt the need the have it in hardcover and consequently bought one.
0062206044|4.0|In this tale of grief and despair, Lemony Snicket (A.K.A. Daniel Handler, who wrote WHY WE BROKE UP) captivated me into the story and invested me into the characters and the wickedness of a person that is Count Olaf.<br /><br />The writing style is probably the best middle grade writing style. When \\"big words\\" appear in the book, Snicket takes time to explain to the reader the definition of that word. The style in which Lemony Snicket writes the book is filled with sorrow and sadness, but for some reason, it's so much fun to read about and I seriously couldn't put it down.<br /><br />Count Olaf is one of my favorite villains of all time. His comebacks to anybody he talks to is very entertaining, and the way that the Baudelaire children try to escape from his cruel ways are very powerful. They had me cheering them on!<br /><br />And the whole ending of the book had me on the edge of my seat. I hate it when a book has an unrealistic ending because the author needed a way for the problem to be solved. I just knew that that strategy would be used in this book, but I was so wrong. This would be a great book to go back and re-read to understand the foreshadowing that slipped under my nose while I read it.<br /><br />The illustrations in the book were fantastic. I'm not sure who drew the pictures (I probably should have looked that up), but they did a great job and really represented the story amazingly.<br /><br />Overall, THE BAD BEGINNING was an excellent middle-grade with misfortune, funny dialogue, and a wonderful ending that was very realistic. This series is going to be great!<br /><br />-Review originally posted at bookyareview.blogspot.com-
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|good way to waste some time on the toilet when you need something to do for fifteen to twenty minutes
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|Clearly, the author is trying to convey a message in the book - 'war is bad; everybody loses.' She has used quite a few tools in doing so - killing off our favorite characters, showing the emotional trauma that the characters experience, stories of war crimes and how war causes otherwise good people to do bad things, etc. There is no problem with all of this if the author does this elegantly. Instead, in this book, she tries to cram far too much story into too few pages. This may make for a 'good' (or mediocre) generic action movie, but not a good book. Maybe she is trying to show that everything happens quickly in war and lots can happen in little time, but it just kills the quality of the story. Then there is also the question of whether the characters' actions are believable. While I am no psychologist and am not able to judge whether the characters would actually act this way under those circumstances, all of it seems just too absurd and convenient (to convey the author's point) such that it decreases the entertainment value of the story. Finally, there is also the issue of the author introducing all these events into the story that conveniently conveys the horror and atrocities of war regardless of how they blend into the overall story.<br /><br />In summary, imagine that you are given a writing assignment where you have to write a story that continues from a prior work. You have certain requirements such as page length and a list of horrors of war that you must describe.  Your final product is a book titled 'Mockingjay'.
B003YL4LYI|5.0|I have enjoyed all the books in the series, and this one is no different. The only negative thing I can say is that there isn't a book six.  Yet.  One of the great things about this series is that it could go on and on. There are so many characters to develop, so much history to explore, and  such intertwined plots that Martin could just jeep writing. If he does, I'll keep reading.
B00846REIS|3.0|Eva and Gideon have a very volatile relationship to say the least. While I really did enjoy the book as a whole, I was slightly disappointed at the end. In the book we find out about the abuse Eva had gone through and we know there's something in Gideon's past of a similar nature that haunts his dreams as well but we don't know what that is.<br /><br />Again I did enjoy the book, enough so that I'll definitely invest in the sequel to see if these two will ever be really happy in their relationship.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|I totally loved this book. Had it download the day it came out and closed the cover that evening. Couldn't put it down. It was exciting, emotional, and had unexpected moments. At times I had tears and at other times my heart was racing. I loved how they were fighting, each in their own way, to keep the relationship going. I thought the character development was wonderful and totally appreciated the \\"issues\\" that they had to work through and how they hadn't given up on each other. Can't wait for Entwined to come out to see how this trilogy ends. LOVED it  - only \\"liked\\"50 Shades.
B007SGM084|2.0|I heard all the blather about this book and watched Katie Couric act like an infactuated teenager with this author.  Ok, I'm curious so I downloaded it to my Kindle.  It's about dominence and submission.  The author would have been better off to flesh out her characters first, not at the end.  It made me question the intelligence of our 22 year olds.  I fould it to be nothing but porn, scene after scene.  I hope it was printed on recycled paper and no trees were destroyed to make paper for this nonsense. Tp those who enjoyed it, good for you.  I don't care for smut.
B007SGM084|5.0|Im sure i read all 3 of these books withen just a few days. to me they were thrilling they made me laugh and cry. They made my heart race and my mind wonder I loved these books my sugestion to you is that you ignore the media and just read them and make your mind up for itself you may be surprised.
098555780X|5.0|The books insructions were incredibly clear, and easy to follow, every knot was extremely detailed and I like how JD added a little info on the knot to go along with it, a very nice detail. This Is by far the best book for tying paracord specifically that I have found. I have noticed a minor inconsistency between the book and JD's youtube videos, for example there may be a different way to start a tie in the book and in the videos (KBK bar. I do not think that this is any major downside however, if anyhting it gives you MORE options for the same knot. Anyways, major props to JD for compliling this book. This book is DEFINITELY worth the money.
B0098VYKSA|5.0|I liked this movie very much. It mixed many well known and lesser known fables and fairy tales in an interesting and well thought out manner, creating a genre of its own making. All in all a great job and very highly recommended viewing experience.
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|This was an awesome book. The characters were well written and great storyline. Epic love story! Can't wait for walking disaster!
B003O86FMW|4.0|I liked \\"the hunger games\\" better. This one is very good but the story gets more complicated. I found the ending very good, great suspense!  I finished reading and instantly wanted to read book 3 to know what happened next. I greatly recommend it. I think the author did a great job with Katniss (main character). I could imagine and see the story through her eyes.
B004YW4L5K|5.0|Great book!  I love having it on my Kindle. The way Gaiman portrays the gods are creative and done with his signature style. The whole book has a noir feel. Sort of dark and moody but also fun and almost real.
B0060YIBLK|5.0|I would recommend this book to anyone who wishes to improve their communication skills.  These techniques will work in any setting.  I believe most of us are lacking in proper social skills at one time or another--whether it is private or public.  It doesn't necessarily mean you are a social dud but only that you want to improve your ability to communicate with others and draw them out about themselves.  I found it quite helpful in providing helpful techniques to accompolish this.  It pointed out some errors we are all guilty of and shows how we come across to others.  I felt it was well written and got to the point quickly and precisely without being too \\"wordy\\" and belaboring each point being made.
B002DQFHKM|4.0|While I'll be the first to admit I don't like every single song on the soundtrack, I love enough of them that it made it worth purchasing> I still don't know why they won't let us buy individual songs, but I guess that's what the creators of the album wanted. I bought it specifically for the theme song by Sammy Hagar; I like this version much better than the cleaned up polished version he remade later on. \\"The Mob Rules\\" by Black Sabbath is also one I had to have. I also bought it for the songs by Don Felder and Riggs-- some songs should NOT be allowed to just fade away into the past. \\"Radar Rider\\" and \\"Heavy Metal (Take a Ride) \\" still kick ass as much as they did back then, some songs never get old. As said , I didn't care for every single song, but I give this album at least 4 stars.
B0047Y17P2|2.0|Even though Micheal Halley and Harry Bosch are cousins this LIncoln Lawyer was really weak. Too much court dialogue, not enough suspense. The end was no surprise. I think the Lincoln Lawyer should get in his car and drive off into never never land if he can't do any better than this. Harry is much better with the suspense.
B008MG1E4A|3.0|I learned a lot in reading this book......most important:  not all SEAL teams are created equal.  I'd thought that before.....but Mark's detailed description of what it took for him to \\"get promoted\\" from SEAL Team Five to Team Six was very interesting.  I was also interested in the details of the weaponry he used.....all custom stuff made to his specs.  As for the raid itself...he's lucky to have lived through the chopper crash.  He gives credit where it's due also:  one CIA analyst who spent five years of her life chasing down every lead......and was 100% sure that bin Laden was in that house.  Very impressive work.....on everyone's part.
B007GCY8FS|5.0|Jack Reacher continues to find great adventures along the highway with his thumb stuck out hitching a ride. A Wanted Man was as great as any of the Jack Reacher series. Keep it up Lee!
B006885IBO|5.0|You want to know where it's at ? this will show you with eyes wide shut. Turn away if you wish to remain ignorant. Watch the entire program if you have a soul. As the show said \\"You know when you talk to your weapon like it is a woman people think your insane. You know that right?\\" \\"That's how I roll.\\"<br /><br />Watch one episode of this program and then go watch the wikileaks video with the helicopter attack. Suddenly their dialog makes a lot more sense.
B0032CVAQQ|4.0|Very insightful and well written book. I recommend this for anyone looking to improve their relationship with their significant other. You don't have to be on the verge of divorce to find some good take-aways for this relatively short read. My wife mentions on several occasions that I am incredibly hard to shop for and buy presents for. Turns out that of the 5 love languages, \\"Receiving Gifts\\" is the language I speak the least-as long as I can remember I've never really cared if some got me a present or not.<br /><br />Some aspects of the book seem like common sense...after the fact, that is. I feel a little bad that I had to read a book to figure some of these things out, after which I was like \\"well duh, stupid\\". This book is a good guide in that it points out things to look for in your relationship that you may not notice on your own, or have learned to ignore/tolerate, and using you partner's love language to improve on things. I will definately come back to this from time to time for a refresher.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|Book was well written and moved at a fast pace.  I enjoyed jumping right in to the action then stepping back to see how the author got there asbhe took us on his journey through the SEALS.  I am a former military pilot so I really could relate to the authors perspectives inbthis book.  I highly recommend reading it.
B008XX6J4C|5.0|The artists in this CD started out as just some average YouTubers. They made some cool videos, but they weren't \\"blow your mind\\" videos. Eventually they progressed into making some good quality music videos, from which this CD is made.<br /><br />I personally like fast-paced music, which this CD only has on about 40% of the tracks. It is very well done though, despite my taste in music. These guys are professionals, and I recommend buying this CD, not only for the great price, but also for the great music.
B005AVIZ6U|4.0|Suppense is always fun.  I was disappointed to have a strong idea of who did it very soon into the story and perhaps a clue that this was part of the story would have been good before I bought it.  However, it was fun.
B00887490Y|2.0|The Tall Man&#34; has an interesting premise playing with traditional conventions of a thriller. Nothing however is how it seems this film which has some fascinating twists and turns but is, ultimately, absurd. First thing that we need to get out of the way is the fact that &#34;The Tall Man&#34; despite the advertising and the first 40 or so minutes is NOT a horror film nor is it really a supernatural film. If you temper your expectations with this in mind you might enjoy the film but, more than likely, you'll find &#34;The Tall Man&#34; a mildly interesting failure.<br /><br />SPOILERS:<br /><br />Julia Benning (Jessica Biel) serves as a nurse in the dying mining town of Cold Rock unfortunately the town is best known now as a town where most of its children go missing. Local legend suggests that the children are being taken by a mysterious entity nicknamed The Tall Man. When David is taken Benning desperately pursues the attacker to retrieve the child.<br /><br />MAJOR SPOILER:<br /><br />As the story progresses we discover that Julia has been abducting the children feeding them to a secret network headed by her husband who places these kidnapped children from impoverished backgrounds to &#34;deserving&#34; families (largely upper and middle class from what we can tell in the movie). When the town's people find out she refuses to divulge what, exactly, happened to the children suggesting that she killed them to protect the children and their new families.<br /><br />END OF SPOILERS:<br /><br />&#34;The Tall Man&#34; begins as one type of thriller and quickly shifts gears into another type. It's rare that a director can pull of this slight-of-hand (The Prestige [Blu-ray], Stage Fright and Vertigo: Special Edition (Universal Legacy Series) are three that largely succeed at turning genres inside out)and, despite his ambition and talent, Pascal Laugier (Martyrs [Blu-ray]) doesn't have the skills to pull it off with &#34;The Tall Man&#34;; he can't pull the threads together to make this thriller either compelling. Laugier's glacial pacing does the film no favors either as the few moments of suspense that he is able to generate quickly dissipates leaving a thriller with no thrills. Laugier also does the film no favors by allowing the film to continue for 15 minutes after it should have ended. The points revealed could and should have been revealed in other ways (it could easily have been cross cut with the scene of the confession and would have worked better).<br /><br />That's too bad as the film is packed with strong supporting performances including well known faces from TV shows such as Stephen McHattie (Fringe: The Complete First Season), Sammantha Ferris (Supernatural: The Complete Fifth Season) and William B. Davis (The X-Files: The Complete First Season) doing a nice job. Even with the best performances from a supporting cast their roles are underwritten and Biel just doesn't have the depth as a performer to carry the film.<br /><br />&#34;The Tall Man&#34; looks decent if you keep in mind that the the intentional gloomy look of the film. The image doesn't have much depth.<br /><br />The audio sounds quite nice with a nice mix although if you listen in stereo you will find that the dialogue gets lost.<br /><br />As far as special features go we get a single deleted scene, the trailer and the Blu-ray has a compilation of conceptual artwork for the film.<br /><br />&#34;The Tall Man&#34; has ambition, an unusual concept and the director wants to turn the conventions of suspense thrillers on its head. Unfortunately, the devil is in the details (to use a cliche) and there's no devil truly here. Viewers have little tolerance for bait-and-switch movies (witness the mixed reaction to (The Cabin In The Woods [Blu-ray + UltraViolet Digital Copy]) and unless the director can skillfully pull off the project, it's not going to work. Unfortunately &#34;The Tall Man&#34; fails to live up to its potential.<br /><br />I would recommend arental first to see if this is to your taste based on the mixed reviews.rental first to see if this is to your taste based on the mixed reviews.
B008X8QCTO|2.0|I bought the game and don't want to have to buy anything more!  So not fair to do that to consumers...it's like holding us hostage!
B004W48QFG|4.0|Yes, you pretty much have full control over your desktop. However, it would be nice if they had an easy way to download files to your device.
B000HC2LI0|5.0|The packaging is well done with each disc numbered, and each season in its own file<br />folder and the files in a pleasant looking portfolio box with the Presidential seal<br />on it. The clarity isn't up to the Hi Def standards but it's as good as most other<br />movies I've bought( When purchasing I was looking for \\"West Wing\\" in Blu Ray but<br />couldn't find it). I am presently into the 2nd season and am so much enjoying coming<br />back to \\"West Wing\\". The series presents what one would think are realistic situations<br />with realistic characters that one could easily imagine in the White House. In NCIS<br />fashion it combines humor, touching situations, and high drama of the west wing of<br />the white house. The actors do a fantastic job and are totally believable. The sets<br />make you feel you are truly in the White House. The situations that happen really<br />could and in some cases I'm sure have happened. The series is more about the staff<br />of the President rather the president himself. It is so refreshing to see thought<br />provoking entertainment again instead some of the mindless chatter that prevails in<br />so much of television. For me and I'm sure for most, \\"West Wing\\" is a great Buy.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|Just short of a quarter century in the military makes me proud of the men who are the American warriors of today. Love of country and brothers in arms makes this book a must read.
B000026E2C|4.0|(1973)  \\"Wishbone Four\\", is a great rockin' album.  There is still some folk based tunes here, but the band really cooks here.  With tunes such as, \\"Ballad Of The Beacon\\", \\"Sorrel\\", \\"Rock \\"n' Roll Widow\\", \\"So Many Things To Say\\", \\"Doctor\\" and the progressive melodic number \\"Everybody Needs A Friend\\".  Last album with Ted Turner.  Their highest charting album in their career (#44).  Next up 1974's \\"There's The Rub\\".  The only problem with this album, it needs remastered bad.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|NO EASY DAY, from Amazon.com<br /><br />I loved reading this book!  It was well written and kept my interest up.  I hardly wanted to put it down, before going to bed!  It is a great book!<br /><br />I didn't quite get, NO EASY DAY, finished when I hit a wrong button and it took ALL MY BOOKS ON THE KINDLE off the screen and I lost them all!

B003O86FMW|5.0|This sequel to the Hunger Games was excellent. The third sequel Mockingjay was probably a four star except near the end of the book.
B000UVLK1M|3.0|This is less a full review than a quick note on a thought I had listening to the vocal numbers: Boy, Joni Mitchell is a matchless singer--something she doesn't always get credit for, the \\"songwriter\\" part overshadowing the \\"singer\\" part--and nobody here can match her. Tina Turner, Norah Jones, Corinne Bailey Rae, fine singers all--but none of them can deliver the high-strung verve, the finesse, and perhaps above all the audible smarts that made the originals sing. (One could add Diane Krall's brave running jump at 'A Case of You,' on her Paris concert album, to the roster of noble failures.) Joni Mitchell is clearly a very tough act to follow, and I'm afraid the sung numbers here (about half the album) fall flat.<br /><br />For the record, I've heard only one Joni cover that didn't pale next to the original: Bjork's version of 'The Boho Dance,' which is not on \\"River.\\" I guess it takes a brilliant creator to cover an (even more) brilliant creator.

B002SSUQFG|4.0|My first Seiko and my first automatic, has performed more or less as described by the other reviewers of this unit.<br /><br />Couldn't find a definitive note about the 809's 'water resistance' in real life so much...one mentioned swimming w/it and another showering. I decided early that for the price I would use it as I do my $15 Timex Expedition, which is w/out care for environmental factors.<br /><br />I'm not a diver.<br /><br />The watch has performed just fine in shower.<br /><br />In my experience, this unit runs a hair fast each day, but if worn everyday it keeps great time.<br /><br />Banged the crystal on metal door frames a couple of times, not a scratch.<br /><br />My only complaint, the band has popped off a couple of times, can't explain why...I reseat it and tug a bit and can't replicate the issue.<br /><br />For the money, a great value.

B009B2U73I|1.0|I love Diana: I have all of her CDs and also the two DVDs; just love her swing, voice tone and her chops on the piano, stage presence etc...  But this is just a, say, rock/ballad/you-name-it album (?) that a jazz lover could absolutely live without. She's entitled to do what she wants, for God's sake, but jazz lives in another part of \\"Musictown\\", while she currently is paying a visit to somebody else, living 30 blocks away, clearly. She does good and with maximum professionality. But there is no jazz in this CD. Blaaaah.<br /><br />EDIT: well, maybe \\"Blaaaah\\" is too disrespectful to this lady that did so much until now to bring jazz to a larger slice of audience! But I really hope she gets back where she belongs: jazz in quartet or with a larger ensemble. In the meantime I promise I will spin again this CD, trying to like it.

B005TKD512|3.0|The Heaths have written an accessible small book on change management.  It is based on three principles namely:<br />1. Make clear what needs to change and what must be done<br />2. Provide a strong case for wanting the change to take place and participating in the implementation of the change<br />3. Clear the path or situation for change since a people problem (resistance to change) is often a situational problem (unknown roadblocks, contradicting norms and bureaucratic rules etc.).<br /><br />These principles are useful as \\"quickies\\" especially if you are an internal or external consultant trying to convince your client to do something about an undesirable situation. The Heaths provide an example of how to win the minds of clients by getting the former to work out for themselves the real need to make the move to change.  The example based on the deficit model of management (as against the flourishing model) is compelling both to the client who it was meant to impress and to the reader (such as myself).  It is the kind of example an internal consultant may want to emulate.  The example has two characteristics:<br />(1) Within the context in which it was delivered by the internal consultant, the example of what was going on was sufficiently catastrophic to raise the emotions of the client<br />(2) It allowed the client to work out what it meant in terms of figures (instead of the internal consultant to work out the figures).  This provided the intellectual and cognitive motivation to pay attention to the evidence beyond figures.<br /><br />What is new: For people like me, who grew up on the OD masters of the 60 - 70s such as Beckhard and Harris, Schein, and so forth,there is nothing new. However the packaging of a well trodden message of what is required to create the motivation to change is worth a mark.<br /><br />Any weakness:  Yes, I thought that the Heaths run a danger of contradicting themselves when they use catchy but lasting messages such as \\"what looks like a people problem may be a situation problem\\" and then go on to say that \\"for every one to change someone has to act differently\\" thus  putting emphasis on people rather than situations.  This potential contradiction also appears in another appealing message namely: \\"People become exhausted trying to implement change\\" again returning to people rather than to situations.  Switch as a  \\"quickie\\" is worth reading and keeping for some time.  For teaching the fundamentals of change, I still find the OD masters a good starting point.ke a people problem may be a situation problem\\" and then go on to say that \\"for every one to change someone has to act differently\\" thus  putting emphasis on people rather than situations.

I should mention they both look great, and we are all in our sixties and retired. She was reluctant to give me details, just told me to get this book.  I got it the same day and stayed up most of the night reading it.  I only had to share a few key chapters with my husband, and he jumped on board the plan with me.  I promise this book provides food for thought, and is backed up with an extremely informative blog. It is NOT a fad diet book, it is intended to improve your health and intrigue your mind!

B0071BGOJC|4.0|I simply love Ken Follet's historical fiction and this book was no exception, even though it took me a bit longer this time to get truly engaged into the story. Maybe it would have been easier if I had read Fall of Titans again directly before starting Winter of the World. The book has many different stories of people directly or indirectly connected with each other and it was a bit confusing in the beginning to connect the dots. However, what I appreciate is Mr. Follet's thorough research of historical events and that he never draws a black and white picture. He makes an effort to show what led to the events. For example he does not stigmatize the Japanese as being pure evil and imperialistic but points out that the American politicians had frozen their accounts and thus had cut them of the resources they needed for their economy. The Germans are also not all Nazis but there was quite some resistance. Mr. Follet never loses himself in stereotypes. His characters are complex and we understand why the nuclear physicist betrays his secrets to a communist spy, why the communist spy sticks with Stalin even though he hates what Stalin has done to the original communist idea and why the fervent and disillusioned young Nazi turns into a fervent communist at the end of the war. Besides being entertained I also learned a lot through this book. I am looking forward to part 3. Two thumbs up for Mr. Follet.

B008EQIEWS|5.0|The same review of Clash of the Titans applies here:<br /><br />\\"We enjoyed this film tremendously.  In fact, I appreciated the improbability of the action.  We are watching mythical gods here and their foibles and caprices.  What had us totally immersed was the beauty of the visuals.  Truly stunning sets and marvelous computer-generated images, in a way they made me think of an up-to-date of the dream-like engravings by Gustave Dore - also truly fantastic.  You see a world just created and still in evolution, where the elements are still in the upheavals of development: vast, yet untamed forces in a giant but yet untamed universe.\\"<br /><br />Great action here!  Be a child, a dreamer again; relax and enjoy the truly stunning visual trip.<br /><br />Five stars.
B001NZEHMS|4.0|I hadn't heard this album in quite some time.  After listening to the whole thing, it's as good today as it was \\"back in the day.\\"  The Beastie boys were, and always have been, ahead of their time.  This is a true classic that stands up today.

A full five stars.
B006LSZECO|4.0|Well crafted and suspenseful. Held my interest. Great read on an airplane as it absorbs and  engages the reader. Slow beginning but once the tale becomes more clear, it's a must read until the final pages.
B0097GVJWQ|4.0|really enjoyed this game! wasn't crazy about all the running from place to place but the game was hard to put down once started.
B009JZPH32|5.0|I loved this movie!! There was only one part that I didn't enjoy & that was towards the end.<br />*Spoiler Alert*<br />The \\"rewind\\" at the end was annoying. They should've just gone straight through with the ending instead of rewinding part of the story that never happened. Great movie, A- would have been an A+ if they didn't have the \\"rewind\\" in the ending. Either way 2 Thumbs Up, *****s or however you want to rate it. I will be buying this movie on 10/23/2012 when it is released to DVD.
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|wonderfully game can't stop playing. have it on my phone to  finish playing the game is to short but love it this is the best game I bough so far
0374214913|5.0|Simultaneously cutting edge and classic. Also unlike many modern authors, Mr. Sloan knows how to write an ending. A remarkable first effort. Thank you.
B0071BGOJC|5.0|The first one in this trilogy was very good, this one was excellent. Can't  wait for the third one to be published, do not want to wait 2 more years!
B0090EIILU|5.0|I am not a fan of Sascha Baron Cohen movies but this was not stop laughing from the beginning to the end. The boobies were a bit much though.
B0087HT36U|5.0|This app is similar to Angry Birds but not quite as challenging. It's fun to play. You still have to think a little as you don't get unlimited ammo. Hope it has an update soon as I have finished the challenges this one has.
B00526ZKYS|5.0|This book was full of mystery and suspense.  Sci Fi but not quite.  In the beginning I really identified because I have asked myself if the world would not be better with less emotions.  This book was hard to put down and now that I have read the sequel I can not wait for the next one
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I cant stop playing this game it is so fun but when you cant figure out what way to go it gets so frustrating.  :) :) &quot;)
B0097S0TM0|4.0|If you like Pink, you'll love her new cd. I expect to hear several of these on the radio soon. Would definitely recommend for Pink fans.
0545265355|5.0|The Hunger Games trilogy was great all 3 books were hardback which i love. Couldn't stop reading until all were read and wish then that it didn't end, wanted more. Got the books really fast which was nice and packaging was great. Thanks Amazon for the fast and quick delivery as always.
B007J4T2G8|2.0|...for my tastes but that may not be your reaction.  This was not what I expected at all and no  review I quickly scanned  prepared me for this story.  When I guest began reading it I thought it was very trite
B000FC1HQY|3.0|Loved reading about life in Africa.  The characters were very well rounded and interesting. My only complaint is that the story did not flow smoothly.  I would just get into a phase of her life and then in the next chapter she was on to another phase of her life and did not finish with aspects of her life in the last chapter.
B0090EKRKU|5.0|This is a wonderful family movie with a terrific message that is relevant to today's society.  The moral being ... that you cannot continue to consume without replenishing, and that we should not constantly destroy nature for our own gain.  If you do, it ends badly for all.  A powerful message in a fun and colorful package!
B0098VYCCE|5.0|Me and my family (husband, daughter 22, daughter 17) saw this movie.  We all enjoyed it very much.  The storyline was interesting and the special effects were great.
B004UID2LC|1.0|Great idea, probably will work on other Android systems, but I wanted the ability to watch video on a larger screen, and was disappointed. Installed and uninstalled without a problem.
B001L4NJIO|4.0|Outstanding concert blu-ray! It felt like I was there!  Sound and video quality was great.  It looked and sounded even better on my outdoor movie screen.  Our annual screen on the green cook out turned into a POLICE reunion tour lawn party.  !!EXCELLENT!!
B007MB5OCE|5.0|One of the best books I've read in the recent times! It's fast paced, exciting, informative and the most important of all....it's funny! You can travel around the world and eras spanning 60 years through this lovely piece of writing. Highly highly recommended..
B007J4T2G8|1.0|Pretty risqu&eacute;.  I heard it was not for young adults, but I had no idea how detailed it was.  I did not finish the book
B0055PGUYU|5.0|This book is very interesting and educational! I am applying the principles learned from the stories to improve the habits of my own life!  A must read!
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I am enthusiastically heaping more praise on the gigantic pile for this book. I downloaded it after being enthralled by Howey's Kindle Single, \\"The Plagiarist\\" (also fantastic, check it out). Simply put, you don't get this many five star reviews (and fan fiction!) without something truly special. Not wildly science-fiction, this story is accessible to all and easily haunting. There are layers of story, literally and figuratively, but is not in any way overbearing. Read it-- I've told friends about it and no fewer than three have been hooked. Enjoy!
B007FEFLTO|4.0|Winter of the World was a great sequel! I enjoyed traveling through the historic events with Follett's unique characters.  I recommend this book to anyone who enjoys historical fiction.
1594484805|5.0|This is not a \\"read it, and oh wasn't that nice\\" kind of book. This is the kind of book you study, write in the margins, and put to work today! The motivational concepts in this book will make you a more effective manager, and will also give you a better understanding of how you need to reshape your work environment to better facilitate your own motivation. If you want to get the most out of your people and your organization, \\"Drive\\" is the most important set of tools you can have in the bag.
0887307280|5.0|The book revolves around a central idea, that there exists a myth (\\"E-Myth\\") which states: \\"Small businesses are started by entrepreneurs risking capital to make a profit. This is simply not so. The real reasons people start businesses have little to do with entrepreneurship. In fact, this belief in the Entrepreneurial Myth is the most important factor in the devastating rate of small business failure today. Understanding the E-Myth, and applying that understanding to creation and development of a small business, can be the secret to any business's success.\\"<br /><br />To overcome this myth and it's accompanying challenges, the author argues for the deployment of a Franchise Prototype model. It begins with the owner realizing that \\"your business is not your life...the primary purpose of your business is to serve your life, you can then go to work on your business, rather than in it\\".<br /><br />One might than ask themselves, how do I convert my existing business into this new operational model? This is where the Business Development Program, comes into play. The program introduced by GERBER in this book is based on the execution of the following seven steps:<br /><br />1- Your Primary Aim: \\" What do I value the most? What kind of life do I want? What do I want my life to look like, to feel like? Who do I wish to be? Your primary aim is the answer to all these questions.\\"<br /><br />2- Your Strategic Objective: \\"A very clear statement of what your business has to ultimately do for you to achieve your primary aim.\\"<br /><br />3- Your Organizational Strategy: Structure the way the business is going to work, in other words creating the organizational chart -  roles and responsibilities.<br /><br />4- Your Management Strategy: \\"A system designed into your prototype to produce a marketing result.\\"<br /><br />5- Your People Strategy: The way the \\"game\\" (vision/aim) is communicated to the team at the outset. This includes everything from the position contracts (organization chart), to operations manuals, to the standards for performance and accountability.<br /><br />6- Your Marketing Strategy: Knowing who your customer is (demographics) and why they buy (psychographics)<br /><br />7- Your Systems Strategy: The \\"set of things, actions, ideas and information that interact with each other, and in so doing, alter other systems.\\"<br /><br />What sets this book apart is the analysis that the author performs, through a sample business, of issues small business owners encounter. This includes the different personas the owner takes on, as well as the evolution of the business through the maturity cycle. This analysis is what allows the readers to appreciate and embrace the proposed prototype framework that the author then introduces as key to success. A must read in the area of entrepreneurship and small business.chart), to operations manuals, to the standards for performance and accountability.<br /><br />6- Your Marketing Strategy: Knowing who your customer is (demographics) and why they buy (psychographics)<br /><br />7- Your Systems Strategy: The \\"set of things, actions, ideas and information that interact with each other, and in so doing, alter other systems.\\"<br /><br />What sets this book apart is the analysis that the author performs, through a sample business, of issues small business owners encounter.

B007THA4FI|5.0|J.K. Rowling could write an insurance policy and I'd read it - cover to cover . Do not read this book to be uplifted. It is stark reality, and she captures the small town microcosm as well as she captured adolescence in HP. There were really only two characters in the book that I didn't like, and the book is full of characters and how their lives interweave. Most, however, were shown to be human - with all the hearts and warts attached. She not only writes about our prejudices, but she writes about how tragic events can turn lives around, can heal relationships, and can break people apart. This book is like old age - it's not for sissies. If you love J.K. Rowling's writing, however, it is for you.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I downloaded this fun simple app and some upgrades recently took effect which I love. I like the random games but now you can pick winning deals and if you have access to an Internet connection you can choose multiplayer and play competitors online. If you are somewhere with no wifi you can still play random deals. Great game!!!
B0098VYCCE|5.0|This movie surprised us how good it was. Every character (except Snow White) is well developed. The story also tries to be epic, which I think it accomplishes on a small scale. If you like good fantasy movies (LOTR, etc.) you'll enjoy this. But you'll have to overlook Kristen Stewart as Snow White, as her acting and role is rather bad.
B009CPJHY4|5.0|This movie is perfect in every way.  The actors are truly at their best, the story is familar to most people and you can relate to it, the setting is a delight and explosion of color.  This is the best movie I have seen in a long, long time.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|The final chapter of the Hunger Games brought the entire series to the ultimate conclusion.  Written somewhat like the Harry Potter series ending, it did help make sense of the entire series.  The read was fast and well done.
B006XF5BTG|5.0|Solid info, covers the basic knowledge and stays away from marketing hype. Essential if you want to know more about how to build muscle and get results.
B00846TRHY|4.0|I liked this movie.  i was on the fence about renting it and glad i did.  the story was good and I was surprised to see a true movie about the good in the world.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|Wonderful book.  Continues right on with the same well crafted characters from Fall of the Giants.  I predict this trilogy will rank right up there with Pillars of the Earth.
B0083GQ2A0|3.0|I kept thinking something was going to happen, and then the movie abruptly ended.  I was disappointed in this movie and the ending.  Save your money and wait until it comes on TV.
B00933ZB0E|5.0|This true to life drama series is television at its very best. The lead actors, Damian Lewis playing rescued POW and suspected terrorist Marine Sergeant Nicolas Brody and Claire Danes playing driven and bipolar CIA officer Carrie Mathison, deliver outstanding performances. Also delivering stellar performances are the always gorgeous Morena Baccarin as Brody's wife and Mandy Patinkin as Carrie's mentor at the CIA. This truly compelling and credible story will have you holding your breath. I can't wait to see season two.
B006LSZECO|2.0|For those who are reading this book or thinking about reading this book be aware: Don't believe the hype!! I was so excited when I started to read this book. I even recommended it to several friends at work. The first hundred pages are very thought out but as you proceed dialogues between characters are repeated as if the author lost her place. The ending is just horrible, as if the author lost sight of a proper ending for the characters. Her earlier works are the better reads.

B008QMMEOE|5.0|My two year old grandson loves this. Starts out simple, good puzzles and graphics. It works great on my Kindle Fire.
B008673ZAQ|2.0|I know I'm in the minority on this one and I accept that. But sadly, I was very disappointed with this story. I waited for months for the second installment in Gideon and Eva's story only to find it lacking. I didn't care for this story at all because it felt completely different from Bared to You (which I loved). I get that this story built on Bared but it didn't seem to do that, at least for me, at all. Reflected seemed like a complete regression in Gideon and Eva's relationship. The constant back and forth ping pong of emotions and actions was maddening. At 50% into the story I was ready to quit. I am not anticipating reading Entwined because the ending of this story really left an indelible mark on my psyche...and not a good one. Their relationship was terminally ill and I kept thinking at several moments in the story that they need to run far, far away from each other...and fast.<br /><br />I was truly expecting more from this story. But, I think I've come to the end of my road on these \\"damaged\\" hero stories where control and domination are the major emphasis of the story. Will I read Entwined? Probably. Will I rush to read it when it comes out? Probably Not.
B0085TKAW6|5.0|Ken Follett at his best.A great read! One of those books with all the twists and turns and plots and sub plots that we have come to expect from Ken. Even though the history element is familiar the personalisation  of the characters brings the plot to life.
0316228532|1.0|This book is certainly not worthy of the time spent to read it or the hefty price you pay at the register.  It strikes me as an explosion of seven books worth of fowl language and gratuitous sex that the author previously could not use.  There are times when you have to reread sentences to get what she's saying because she's trying to be clever or its over the top \\"descriptive\\".  Did not finish it even though I paid $30 for it.
B001NLKXK2|4.0|This book was recommended by a friend when she learned I had a relative with this Alzheimer's.  It is a quick read of how the person feels during the disease progression.  It was helpful and I recommend it for everyone.<br />.
B006KX3GXO|5.0|I wanted a photo editing app and I came across this one and I love it. No problems with it yet. Im still exploring all the features but so far im loving it :)
B007KOLNXC|3.0|My husband and I are huge Mad Men fans.  When we finished watching the series on Hulu and wanted to continue the only place to get it immediately was Amazon.  Since I'm a prime member and have purchased videos to stream in the past, we decided to purchase it.  While we are able to see the episodes, for the price of the streaming video, I would not make a purchase like this again.  There are too many interruptions in the streaming.  The video can be very choppy.  I should have just purchased the Blu Ray and waiting the 2 days for it to be shipped.
B008CPZNL6|5.0|I just love the flipboard !! I have it on my cell and kindle fire. sure does provide hours of interesting & educational entertainment
1423140605|5.0|This particular book in the series continues off where the last one ended. The demigods arrive in New Rome but something goes wrong and they are forced to leave or fight the Roman demigods and continue on with the prophecy of the seven. This book will not disappoint previous readers of the series and will only make the reader want more. There were times in which I thought some the demigods were going to die or lose and it was very suspenseful! The ending left at an excellent spot to allow the reader to transition to the next book in the series when it is released next year. Excellent story telling and excellent and exciting battles take place. Don't miss it, get yourself a copy and ready now!
B0060AY85C|4.0|Well written and the characters are really interesting and well developed.However, Morrison's novel would be so much better if she did not insist on blaming racism for most of the world's problems. I'm glad I finally read a Toni Morrison novel, but I doubt that I will read another, as I am told the racial skewing predominates most of her work- too bad.

B005ZMUTZ4|5.0|Toy Story 3 was great.  The Spanish speaking and Latin dancing Buzz was the greatest.  My two year-old son was dancing.
B008673ZAQ|4.0|Ok, so I finished reading Reflected in You last night, and it took me all day to figure out how I feel. I gave it 4 stars because I enjoyed my reading experience while I was reading. My frustration came after.I loved Bared to You, and read it multiple times. Without spoiling this review with nitty gritty details, I will list a few things that irked me about this sequel.<br /><br />1. Where is the Gideon I fell in love with in book one? This Gideon was like Christian Grey before he found a soul, but without the bondage...yet!<br /><br />2.Eva was already breaking down in Bared to You. For someone who has been through therapy and knows her weaknesses and was so adamant about not reverting before, her begging for scraps of his attention now is insane!!!!!!!! She made me insane. I had to send the part of my brain that likes to make sense on a mini vacation in order to enjoy my read.<br /><br />3. There was so much hot, steamy, unbridled sex that I actually craved more scenes filled with LOVE. I felt like I had been taken to the edge and not allowed to climax. When they weren't sexing their brains out they were fighting or ignoring each other. (&lt;_&lt;) (>_>) (#_#)<br /><br />4. I didn't pay attention to the page numbers as I read, and had no freakin clue that I had come to the end. Because there was no end. I was able to maintain my composure because I know the next book will answer my questions, but this book was like a layover when you have to run to catch your connecting flight. You race thru the airport to the next flight, just to stand in a line 30 deep at the gate.<br /><br />I still love this story. I'm invested. But after reading Reflected in You, I feel exactly how Eva felt at the end of Bared to You. Ay Dios!
B0061PEAUY|5.0|I am a big fan of Kathy Reichs.  This book is my favorite.  I found it very interesting, particularly about the discovery and history of diamonds in Canada, and the diamond industry itself.  She does have a tendency to go into in depth explanations using medical jargon that is sometimes confusing, but as a whole it was a great read.
B002P7BKJ6|5.0|how did i miss this show for so long? my grown computer geek son spotted it one day as i scrolled channels and said, hey mom, leave it there-after 5 minutes of sheldon i was hooked!all the characters and actors are great-so stereotypical from their hairdos, clothing styles and social awkwardness-if you haven;t watched, do it!
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I had stopped reading Nicholas Sparks years ago. Then, I started with \\"The Lucky One\\" because I knew there was a movie out based on it. I AM SO glad to be back in Mr. Sparks reading realm!<br />Truly, truly enjoyed this book!<br />To those of you who stopped because he was kind of wishy washy....give him another shot! It's going to be SO worth it!
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|Love this game. It is a great way to spend your time while waiting at a doctors appointment. Just keeps going and don't have to worry about running out of coins they replenish as needed.
B005LLSNNE|5.0|This is a awesome show ... can't wait from week to week to watch it, we wish it would just keep on playing and playing..... love it........
B0096DFBZQ|5.0|Grandson really enjoys playing this game while we are sitting and waiting at doctor appointments. Older kids and adults would enjoy it also to use up time waiting around or just to beat the boredom
B00846REIS|5.0|A great book..story of strong attraction that is physical at first but goes deeper into the couples hearts bringing out painful pasts that strengthens their bond.
B0051UP5NQ|1.0|installed fine with expected functions but soon said there was an update, which I accepted.<br /><br />after the update, the font selection has been removed and it says I must pay 5 dollars for another upgrade to get the fonts back,<br /><br />absolutely ridiculous. better products are but there.  avoid this scam.
1741798981|4.0|Almost too comprehensive, but when you spend some time reading through the pages, it contains a wealth of information. We planned only 5 days in London and probably could do with a smaller guide, but, in the end, this guide helped us figure out where to stay and what sights we could probably do within the limits of our time.
0525953728|5.0|These two accounts of Bin Laden courier Ahmed al-Kuwaiti's death cannot both be true:<br /><br />Pfarrer:<br />Stealth Hawk helicopter Razor 2 flies over the compound yard. Al-Kuwaiti and his wife appears in the lit doorway of the guest house. Al Kuwaiti fires his AK-47. From the helicopter doorway, Master Chief Mel Hoyle (of the Maersk Alabama rescue), and a second sniper fire down on al-Kuwaiti. \\"In the doorway, al-Kuwaiti was blown off his feet. His AK-47 spun in a half circle up and out of his hands. Two of the bullets passed though his chest and killed the person standing next to him. It was his wife\\".<br /><br />Owen:<br />Stealth Hawk Chalk 1, carrying Owen's team, crashes in the compound. The team escapes from the helicopter, breaches the compound's inner gate, and assaults the guest house where al-Kuwaiti is waiting. Al-Kuwaiti fires from behind the guest house door. Owen and an Arabic-speaking team member return fire. Shortly, al-Kuwaiti's wife emerges from the guest house carrying a baby. \\"He is dead,\\" she said in Arabic. \\"You shot him. He is dead. You killed him.\\"<br /><br />According to various Pakistan news media, the Pakistan Inquiry Commission on the Abbottabad Operation<br />interviewed the wife of Abu Ahmed Al-Kuwaiti, who is therefore alive, obviously.<br /><br />Since al-Kuwaiti's wife is alive, Pfarrer's version cannot be correct.
B0098VXMNE|5.0|While Liam McIntyre is no Andy Whitfield, the diminished star power in the title role allows the other performers to shine.  Lucy Lawless is flawless as a broken but ruthlessly focused Lucretia; Manu Bennett, the brooding and wounded Crixus, is, as always, compelling; but the special treat of VENGEANCE is Dustin Clare's super-stud portrayal of Gannicus.  In the end though what really makes this season stand out are the villains: Nick Tarabay's Ashur; Viva Bianca's Ilithyia; and last but not least, Craig Parker's Gaius Claudius Glaber.
B008XCJ03K|5.0|I haven't come across music I liked this much since Mumford and Sons, and honestly.. I think the lyrics may be a tad bit better than any Mumford song I've heard.  If you can't relate to any of these songs, you need to get out more.  I am an absolute fan as of about 30 minutes ago.<br /><br />I just hope that there are more songs on the way.  YouTube a video for \\"Words\\"... Nevermind, let me do it for you. You can thank me later.<br /><br />[...]<br /><br />If you love great lyrics and heart warming music.. I recommend you buy everything you can from Passenger.
B0098VYCCE|5.0|It was an excellent movie!!! I love to watch Kristen Stewart and Charlize Theron!! I love all if their movie this one did not disappoint!!!
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|awesome for the price (99&cent; when I got it). I played Enigmatis on my pc previously and thought it translated very nicely to the kindle. I love games where the mystery actually unfolds through out the game, it never felt like I was simply following a trail of breadcrumbs as is often the case for me with this type of game. Enjoyed the piecing together of clues on the evidence board, graphics were nice as was the audio. The only thing I thought could be improved was to have an interactive map ( jumping to locations just by clicking) as there was  much going back and forth and travel felt somewhat tedious on the kindle. still, i loved it and will be back for the sequel!
B000KFB4PK|5.0|These watches are creatative and enjoyable. I get many comments when wearing this watch, Some people want to play with it. Good conversation starter.
B007BZM3HK|5.0|I loved this song by Carly Rae Jepsen.<br /><br />I saw her music video of this song on youtube.<br /><br />I think she  is a beautiful girl.<br /><br />I love her singing voice.
1423140605|3.0|I could not put this book down. I LOVE LOVE LOVED it!!!!!!!!!! I was halfway through, though, when the book froze. i cant finish it because every time i try to get back to the part where i was at (the exact same spot), it just freezes and goes back to the homepage. Amazon REALLY needs to fix this.
B0058SNI5S|3.0|I LOVE this shoe!! I think it is so cite; however, they do not offer 1/2 sizes. I usually wear a 9 1/2.  I ordered the 10 & it was too big (I couldn't walk without them slipping off my feet). So then I returned them & got the 9s. Now they are too tight :(
B006UAWJS0|5.0|I love the show... I cannot wait until October 11th for season 4 to start.....<br />Im in love with Stefen.

B0083EW97W|5.0|John Mayer has been an impressive young musician and songwriter, but was unfairly placed in the Pop music genre.  His ability to match licks with the likes of Buddy Guy, Eric Clapton, Tom Petty and also write original songs that have depth and real meaning make him much more than a Pop idol.  Born and Raised emphasizes his ability to express his art in many genre types.  Love is a Verb is such a great statement about mature relationships and how the way we look at love changes with age.  Buy this and you won't regret a single tune!
B0097GVJWQ|1.0|But I was wrong. Never have had much luck with Big Fish games working properly on my K-Fire and this game is no different. Let s me enter my player name and then it locks up. Have tried deleting and reinstalling same thing happens. now I will just delete. File under junk game. worthless.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|Best app on the market. The only problem with it is that when you pass the easy levals it gets REALLY hard. But otherwise great app.
B0058VW36U|5.0|Extremly nice graphics.Extreme fun.Extreme disirable.Extreme Awsomness. Deserves five stars belive me or not.I would have been fine paying $4.99.99&cent;? worth more. way more,more,more!!!!:&bull;)

B00992CF6W|5.0|Sometimes fun. If someone says what game do you want to play,it's this. Thank you for your time for listening.
0525953728|5.0|This book is a must read that is well written and very hard to put down.  It gives readers insite to some of the sacrifices our Military make in order to protect America while NOT giving away confidential information.  The words,'American Heros', truly describe the author, our Navy Seals, and all of our fighting men and women.  Well done Sir!
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|I am so addicted to this game. I thought it was crazy at first but after playing it a few times I fell in love and I play it everyday almost all day.....I wont even let anyone else play it....
B008XG1X18|5.0|works great I love pinterest. easy pinning and it runs smoothly. I wouldn't change a thing about it. great app
B0098VYKSA|4.0|Absolutely a joy to watch.  I was entertained the entire time. acting and cinematography were superb. Brings teh old take to life in a new way and leaves you feeling like you have relived the adventure all over again.
0525953728|5.0|I really enjoyed reading this book. It took me less than a day because I couldn't put it down. I thought it was well written and glad that he actually went through how he was trained. After all of the statements about this book giving away government secrets, I didn't find it to be so. I am especially thankful that the story is out there and that the proceeds are going to help so many different groups
B000FCKGPC|5.0|This is a book from the quintet on a Game of Thrones. Once started it is hard to stop reading. The game of thrones is a cruel game. Several of the characters are reckless, the game is played on life and death, the language is semi old fashioned, by simple tricks like writing twenty four as  four-and-twenty. Still the author seems to have studied quite some sources on medieval castles, warfare and ordinary life. It is fascinating from the very first chapter. I you want yourself to hide in a book and you like a well told story, just read on... So I finished this  and made certain I had downloaded book five, before I went abroad.
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|\\"The only thing I'm afraid of is a life without you.\\"<br /><br />This book was so good! Travis and Abby are something else! You can't help but love them both. When reading you never know what is going to happen next. You may think you know, but Jaime has a way of sneaking things up on you!<br /><br />There were times that I was mad at Travis or Abby, but that's what made me like the book even more. They both aren't perfect and they are likable. The one scene towards the end (don't wanna give anything away, so I won't say!) had me on the edge of my seat. I didn't know what was going to happen.<br /><br />Overall, I really enjoyed the book and cant wait for the next one!
B00171EO0I|5.0|Great movie...saw it on TV and just had to buy it. It's a love story, a comedy, a tear jerker and hopeful. Loved the characters,and the actors where great...twists and turns. Makes one hopeful that love is always there in some shape or form.  Hope you enjoy it as much as I did.
B0052RDHTM|5.0|An outstanding historical novel must weave factual evidence within the lives of fictional characters who are believable.  Mr. Follett does this amazing feat with ease.  As the reader moves from the coal mines of Wales to the mansions of the coal mine owners, the people who live with poverty or wealth are cast against world situations that are without their understanding, or ability to escape.  Although there are many characters it is not difficult to seperate their lives and events that affect their lives.<br /><br />The events preceding World War I may seem vague to the reader until it affects the men and women of this story.  Why was the assination of an Arch Duke important to the rest of the world?  Mr. Follett examines this event and explains the chain of events for the average reader.  The author's ability to make facts and fiction co-mingle is wonderful.  Never does the reader feel burdened with too many facts.<br /><br />I was happy to know that there was a sequal to this title.  I read this book on my Kindle and can't wait to begin the sequal.
B007GCY8FS|4.0|Lee Child superbly crafts another Reacher novel.  Its start is a little slow and over-descriptive.  But it soon develops into a typically complex and provocative plot.  A very good read!
B006DRVFRQ|5.0|I am so happy it is finally on the app store. Now I can truly enjoy my Kindle Fire HD.
B0099G4Y26|5.0|Awesome..Pink is an incredible performer.I have not had a chance to read the book yet but I'm sure it will be great.
B00932A2MC|3.0|but \\"formula\\" action adventures need something extra - more than Battleship did - to get past three stars.  I found it difficult to relate to the testosterone-driven characters.
B000QCQ8Y4|5.0|Great, quick read. Not Tom Cruise character.  Team element is nice change from Reacher solo action  and  descriptions of LA bring story a real quality.
B000QRIGLC|3.0|Good read with first hand knowlege of the actual battle. Little slow at times and confusing, but so is life.
B008673ZAQ|4.0|This book was great! Follows in line with first book, cant wait for he third book to come out and follow the story to the end.
B008MG1E4A|3.0|Not the best read ever, but it does tell the story. Wish we could know the true story, but I don't have the clearance. Enjoyed the book. Would reccommend it to my co-workers.
B002RSDW80|5.0|Bought this for my mom who didn't love the movie at first, but now really likes it now so I bought it for her.  Arrived very fast and in great condition.
B007GCY8FS|5.0|As usual, Lee Child deliver's a solid read. Keeps you pinned to the page wanting more and more. You will enjoy this book.
B007MB5OCE|4.0|The old man is a lot like Forest Gump, meets alot of people, effects alot of lives.  The premise may be familiar but the characters work to make the book an enjoyable read.  Who the old man meets is just as interesting as what happens after he climps out the window.  Or before he climbs out the window in some cases. If you are looking for a light hearted read with a few good laughs this is the one.
B0053O89WY|5.0|The Big Bang Theory fifth season is a hoot. Those characters are so funny and the lines are so memorabile. I love Sheldon even though he is self-centered. Leonard is a basket case waiting to be found. Penny is delightful and funny. The rest of the cast adds so much to the comdey series. I love this series and I recommend this DVD to anyone who loves to laugh.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Although I haven't finished reading it yet, after about the first ten pages I was hooked on \\"The Hunger Games\\". I suppose it helps that I like fantasy as well as horror and a few other non-mainstream genres. A well written book that keeps the reader engrossed through the chapters.
B003DKJ5ZU|5.0|Excellent animation.<br />The story is simple but well told.<br />The detail is excellent.<br />The colors are glorious.<br />And its Tink.
B009KHDT0C|4.0|It was cool fun to watch and expecting a # 2 Dark Shadows.  Watching the original soap opera was actually emotional and a cheering thing for Barnabas.  Johnny Depp was as great as ever and all the<br />actors was as well.  Recommend this movie, just for the fun and gore....
B007GCY8FS|5.0|Excellent read.  This book contains vivid descriptions of Jack Reacher and once again provides ample reasons why Tom Cruise can in no way shape or form play a credible Jack Reacher in a movie - unless he is able to grow ~ 10\\" and gain about 90 pounds of muscle.
B004I744AS|5.0|I really like the home page with the history, hangman,weather word of the day and so much more. I also like the fact you can get it to say the word. I would tell everyone to get this.
B007AJFSJW|5.0|If only the Republicans were not the 19th century party and the Democrats had the courage of their convictions. Then we could listen to this advice and avoid the lost decade that we are now one third of the way through. If only.
B0053O89YM|5.0|Good service, good experience and good quality. I receive it fasts :) :) :) :) :) :). :) :) :)
B006TF6WAM|4.0|I really enjoyed this book. I was hooked from the get go. I loved Harold and his poignant pilgrim. Well worth taking time to read.
B002UZ5JEA|5.0|Well-researched, intensely human. I found the portrayal of the family-situation very real at the start of the book. Haven't read many other Crichton books but he managed to get the emotions and strife down successfully.<br /><br />Crichton's research into AI made the AI presence seem very real. Perhaps non-technical readers will skip some parts, due to the high level of accurate detail. The concept is conveyed convincingly, making the story somewhat chilly as an Artur C. Clarke-like future vision.
B0089ZEEYG|1.0|Uh glad it was free, surely wouldn't have paid for it..  Although it did work on evo 3d game sucks
B005COO1X6|2.0|I expect more from Steven King. This was simply The Raft with a car. It was very predictable. Can't recommend this one.
B004SVM7BW|5.0|I read a lot of medical articles in Pdt format. repligo reader has revolutionized the reading experience on kindle. the ability to adjust size, appearance, commrnt and edit the file obviate the need for paper copies. Above all the new ebook reading mode automatically recognizes the text and images and sizes them to fit your screen perfectly emulating an e book experience while still being able to adjust text size and appearance. I also download many online books that I have subscription for to Pdf through Google chrome and thus am able to emulate an shook reading experience without paying twice for the book ( once for the print/nonlinear version and second time for the dedicated ebook). I rarely write reviews about software, I just wanted to share my utterly positive experience with other users so they can benefit from this great program too in their work and leisure
B004AQR24W|5.0|There is a lot of action and some tongue-in-cheek comedy. It played well on my kindle fire while I was flying from S.C. to S.F.
B00486UF8Y|5.0|Still cool, timeless wisdom and yet so obviously a product of it's time - beautiful indeed is consciousness revealed, also love \\"Fierce Grace\\" movie of Ram Das after being stroked, cool :-)
B0063IH60K|5.0|It is challenging and realistic.  it isn't so easy that you win all the time and not so hard that you lose all the time.  I am still a little confused about all the different deals though.
B00008ACIN|4.0|Nothing can compares the sound of vinyls and more impressive is how warm the guitar sounds!!! The presentation paper of the cover is different and nice but It will be better if the vinyls were 180 grams.
B005USZYDU|5.0|John Grisham has created a new character in Theodore Boone that should appeal to the younger generation.  His stories are intriguing and capture the imagination from the first pages.  This is a good read for young people as well as fans of his adult literature.
B00932A2MC|3.0|I buy into most of this movie, but cannot believe that some alien scum could destroy the USS Missouri.  That part is a little far fetched.  Seriously, it's descent mindless entertainment, but a little to similar to computer FX movies like Armageddon.
B004SJ3BCI|1.0|Had Angry Birds on tablet when I bought it ... worked for about a week ... then it would open the first game (play it) then reset so the game was not played at all. Finally the game wouldn't open at all. Downloaded this game to see if it would re-install ... nothing. There is no fix if android decides to become corrupt so it is now a paperweight. Other apps are starting not to work too. Android appears to be a phone OS and nothing more. If you go on the internet and search for a fix the best recommendation is to buy a new one ... yeah right.
B0055PGUYU|5.0|When I quit drinking, my doctor recommended The Power Of Habit. I do not usually read self help books, but thank goodness  took her advice and read it.<br /><br />For me - it gave me the \\"buy in\\" in an easy to read scientific description of what a habit is, using medical study information and real life stories. Never is the term \\"just change\\" used, the habit process is clearly laid out in steps that makes breaking a habit doable to the reader.<br /><br />In further chapters The Power of Habit gives you all the tools to change, using substitution, distraction and common sense.  The book walks you through the process in strong steps, some humor and warmth spattered throughout.<br /><br />The Power of Habit could be a life changer in both personal and in business lives, and I can highly recommend it to anyone that wants to change their bad habits and be a happier and more productive person.  The doctor who recommended it to me is a tri athelete and she used it to improve her sports skills.<br /><br />Happy to report that this book has helped me to stay sober!
B007GCY8FS|5.0|Another GREAT Jack Reacher novel.  Something new on every page.  I never tire of reading Lee Child's novels.  Mr Childs writing is so descriptive that you sometimes feel you are in the moment of the story.  Excellent read.  Thanks for the great book Mr. Child.
B007Z9QP3K|5.0|As a submarine veteran I find this movie an absolutely true portrayal of life aboard a WWII German (and by extension American) submarine.
B009GENZ12|3.0|Jessica B was pretty good in the movie. The pacing of the movie was strong and engaging. The actress who played the mute girl was good also.
1608862771|5.0|I discovered Mattias work in the NY Times Magazine and started following his blog.  This book is a compilation of sketches from his moleskin which make it feel so personal.  The drawings are so detailed, I find myself starring at them for long periods of time and each time discovering a new detail I missed the last time.  Thank you for such a beautiful gift!
B007MS5B6Q|5.0|Great season. The head is well detailed. Great collectors item. Amazons prices are the best out there! I would def recommend for anyone that likes the walking dead
B0090P98Z4|5.0|I'm not a game player but I love this game.  lt is even great for joystick challenges Nyerere people like me.
0316228532|4.0|having just finished this book, i feel heartbroken finishing it after feeling as if i became a part of the Pagford and Yarvill community-i felt the pain in Krystal Weedon and the desperation and smugness of a community and the constant need for gossip-each character is relatable and we all see bits of ourselves in each of them. i am a lover of the HP novels and reading this-not expecting magic but the superb writing of Rowling was completely on par.
B007GCY8FS|2.0|As a long time Lee Child fan I was very disappointed in this latest release. The plot was stale and predicable . I could never get into this book, boring from the first page to the last.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This book was wonderfully written and also one of the most moving books i've ever read. Aside from the beautiful words, the story was en-capturing, insightful, and thought-provoking. I would recommend this book to anyone with a soul, heck anyone without one might develop one after they read this book! Kudos to John Green for producing another great book.
B007GCY8FS|2.0|I have read all the Jack Reacher novels and love them all except this one. Reacher is a man of action , of which there was none till the last 30 pages of the book. Lee Child is a very good author so I will give him slack on this one . If I would recommend him to a friend to read I would never pick this book. Actually if this was my first Reacher novel I do not think i would pick up another book of his. The plot was confusing and hard to follow and the book extremely slow. Lee you can do better then this !!!!!
B007GCY8FS|3.0|I am disappointed in the direction that Jack seems to be going. A good book, not up to his slam bang ways of the past.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|Very detailed and seems well researched.<br />The characters are plausable and act in believable ways.<br />The sheer number of characters reminds me of \\"War and Peace\\".
B006LSZECO|1.0|I will keep it simple.  This was one of the worst books I have ever read.  If I bought a hard copy of the book instead of a kindle copy, I would have returned it after the first chapter.  But since I was stuck with it, I read it. I realize that we all have different tastes and interests of course.  And I respect that others may have enjoyed it.  But to me, this book was poorly written.  And there was absolutely nothing likable about either of the main characters.  I would not recommend this book at all.  I did not enjoy any part of it. Like the characters, the book was inane and insane.
B0071BGOJC|5.0|Good follow-up to the first volume in this series. The second generation characters are just as interesting as their elders from the first volume, who also appear in this volume.
B008GX2YQQ|4.0|So far every Animal Collective album to date has been radically different the the last while at the same time introducing the listener to combinations of styles from all over music history and the world, which is one of my favorite qualities of any band. Not only this but the songwriting and emotion delivered on every album has been powerful and heartfelt, from Avey Tare's wordy Sid Barret style lyrics to Panda Bear's mantra meets nursery-rhyme approach.  This album, to me, represents one the few territories Animal Collective had yet to try out:  The traditional rock band approach.  Replacing Merriweather's looped electronic beats and minimal percussion Panda Bear is sitting down at a drum kit for the first time since the band's very early days, albeit sans snare drum and high hat (snare being replaced by two congas and giant shaker filling the usual space of the high hat).  Also new to the soundscape are actual bass lines where previously there had only been minimal bass or none at all.  The songwriting has also taken a turn for the more direct.  Animal Collective are known for throwing out the rule book on traditional verse-chorus-verse structure but on Centipede Hz most songs have a very recognizable verse-bridge-chorus pop/rock song structure which actually leads to some pretty dense songs that can only be fully grasped upon repeated listens.<br />Many have complained that the band isn't doing anything new on Centipede Hz and while that may be true in the scope of music history I would say that they are certainly doing something new for themselves.  All in all the songwriting is strong, with one or two exceptions.  Avey has once again taken most of the songwriting duties with Panda only including two songs (both great in my opinion) and Deakin finally contributing a song of his own that is a little long winded but has a great finish and is a perfect middle-point to the album.  In the context of Animal Collective records I don't think this is the best they have made, but I still think it's a great album from one of the most influential groups of the last decade.
B00913DPW2|4.0|I liked this! Played on my Kindle Fire and had no problems.  Game is not too hard and not too easy, if you want a game that moves you around alot with some spooky fun...get this!
0307730697|5.0|Outstanding book. Well written. Adam Brown is a inspiration and a true patriot, hero, and wonderful father and husband. I wish he was still here battling AQ, the Taliban, and any one else who wants a piece of the U.S.A.
B005HSL626|5.0|I love this app so much I play it all The time I love u guy's for this app its ASOME JUST ASOME I LOVE IT!  :) I love u guy's ill say it a mullion billion times if I have to I jumped up and down wene I saw this.There I was have asleep looking for a new app and there It was I almost died thanks
0525953728|5.0|Damn, this was a great book. \\"Mark Owen\\" is a beast. His teammates from DEVRU Group are also beasts. Its good to know we got this guys ready to roll for our country. Buy this book. Read it. Ponder how satisfying it must have been for those men standing over \\"The Shiek\\" in his bed room while he lay on the floor with a hole in his head. Appreciate just how hard these guys train and how much they sacrifice to achieve their level of pure lethal effectiveness.
B0055SWM08|4.0|I simply love this game and the music. It is very relaxing but makes you think. I shared it with my family and they love it too.
B009329Y30|5.0|I enjoyed this story so much.  I loved the story, the characters, the setting, everything.  I have read the book 3 times and watched the movie 4.  Can't get tired of it.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I really enjoyed this last one. It was amazing, definitely worth the time and money. I would absolutely recommend it.
B0087HT36U|5.0|Love this game. Couldn't put it down. Can't wait for the Age of Cowboys. Worked great on Acer tablet. Hurry.. for the next stage
B0054JZC6E|4.0|fun for a beginner like myself. my man plays x-box while I fiddle with this. some of the games can really be a challenge
B006LSZECO|5.0|I can see now why this book was on the top 10 reading list.  From the first chapter till the end it kept me going.  Please take the time  to read you will really enjoy this book.
B005DI994W|5.0|One of, if not , the best Queen and Country films during the time that \\"the sun never set on the British Empire\\".  It has everything, scope, action character study and of course romance.  Truly an epic film.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|The truth in a quick read \\"guy\\" format with a no holes barred style. Makes you feel like you're right there on every mission, side by side with the Seal Team.
B0098VYCCE|3.0|luckily Ms Theron planted the anchor for an other wise mis-cast, weakly written version of this timeless classic. A heavy reliance upon CGI and DI was most likely pitched to compensate for weaknesses in story. What's most unfortunate is that because of the convenience of visual animation and the economy of filmless production, we're left with lazy filmaking. Regardless of the negatives, the perspective is fresh in trying to keep with traditional versions and I'll still keep it in my library along with the other variations. If it's any consolation, it was well shot, visually pleasing and the effects were pleasant. I killed a bowl of ramen noodlez and a PB&J sandwich, so it wasn't a total loss. A formulaic guilty pleasure indeed.
B007GCY8FS|5.0|Maybe not the best Reacher, but certainly up there.  After a while it's got to be difficult to find story lines but Child seems to have it down
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|great game for those who like to play coins games I simply love it really it keeps you going the added coins after one minute is a real plus for me
B005LLSNNE|5.0|One of the best series I have watched in a long time. Very entertaining. Looking forward to catching future seasons.
B009KHDT0C|4.0|We both watched this last night and thought it was very entertaining. In years past I have watched the old series of dark shadows but liked this much more it was funny. We like most of the Depp movies and were not dissapointed. There were a couple of sex scenes so you might want to review it if small children are watching I think that is why it is rated PG 13.
B003YFIUW8|5.0|Wanted to keep reading this book. Very thought provoking. I was almost sad when I was done reading. I wanted to continue my journey with Jack and Ma.
B008MG1E4A|4.0|I read this book in one sitting on a Saturday afternoon. It is a bit of a tease, in that they dive right into the raid on Bin Laden from the get go, but then stop short, and give you the next 3/4s of the book as flashback to the soldier's life and times. The actual 20% of the book about the raid is 5 star, and the rest is 3-4 stars. The one disappointing thing about this book that I had trouble dismissing is that the author is very respectful of all his commanding officers and fellow soldiers except one. To no particular benefit to the story, and out of character of the purpose of the book, the author goes out of his way to rip his commander in chief every time he is mentioned. I couldn't help but think, given the election timing of this book, and the fact that he released it without the authorization of the military -- that someone with some political money put him up to attempting to swiftboat Obama's role in the Bin Laden capture. For me it left a bad taste on what was otherwise a compelling first hand account.
B000FC1LOC|5.0|I would give this book 10 stars if I could - Jodi Picoult never disappoints.  I could not put this book down, and when I wasn't reading it I couldn't keep my mind off the characters and the story.
B008XG1X18|4.0|I spend far too much time using the Pinterest app... It runs ok on the Kindle Fire with a couple of exceptions... If you click through to a site on the web, the app sometimes force closes when you get back to Pinterest.  Also periodically it gives a white screen when you start up.<br /><br />But other than that, I love it.
B0095R64AO|3.0|I thought this movie was going to be what it was. Ok.  It wasn't horrible it wasn't great.  I'll probably watch it again  in a month to see if I'll enjoy it more.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|is super fun and I cant get off it.. its addicted and I cant put my kindle down from playing it I wish I could fey this game on my phone
B001P06GX4|3.0|I've been unsure about this game since its inception, but seeing that it continues to win awards, I finally broke down & bought it. Let's get the [obvious] negative out of the way. As I expected, it's made of mediocre plastic. I'm curious to see how long it takes before something breaks. That said, the pieces do elegantly snap into place.<br /><br />My personal snobbery aside, it's a decent game & I'm sure the more I play, the more subtle intricacies will unfold. The available shapes limit variety a bit, but this may be a good thing. You can play strictly by the rules given or, as I will be doing, combine those rules with go. By the end of a round, Blokus has a similar aesthetic to a go board & can therefore be scored the same (based on territory). That appeals to me, as I like the aesthetic of go, but find that game horribly confusing. Blokus resolves the confusion with additional confines.<br /><br />I highly recommend Blokus to casual go players & parents looking to play abstract strategy games with their kids.
B0091ICDHU|5.0|I was drawn in after the first few pages and didn't come up for air until I finished.<br />I loved slammed poetry before this book but love it even more after.<br />The character building was just right. Oh so funny and heart breaking, I laughed cried along with them.
0452289963|5.0|Reading Tolle's work is like a mini-meditation in itself. Some of the material can be fairly deep, but throughout he retains a light, amused undertone which helps convince us that his words will help us get on the right track.
B008C1O8CA|3.0|Billie Joe Armstrong said, \\"We are at the most prolific and creative time in our lives.\\"  Prolific?  Sure.  This album is the first of a trilogy so there was clearly a lot of material in the works.  Creative?  I don't know.  Maybe we'll hear some of that on the two upcoming releases.  Their best decision was to not attempt another remake of \\"American Idiot\\" like they did with \\"21st Century Breakdown.\\"  While that album had many fine moments, the over-the-top production mixed with the bombastic nature of some of the songs made it seem a bit too obvious that the guys were copying themselves.  Between the two releases was the Foxboro Hot Tubs side project, which seems to be more of who Green Day truly is.  It made \\"21st Century\\" seem insincere and unnecessarily polished in their quest for a repeat success of the \\"American Idiot\\" phenomenon.  Even Billie Joe has called \\"Dos,\\" the upcoming second release in the trilogy, \\"the second Foxboro album.\\"<br /><br />So what do we have with \\"Uno\\"?  It's always hard to follow complex productions with a more stripped down sound and appear like you're giving it your all.  That's how albums like Weezer's Green Album or Sloan's \\"Action Pact\\" come about. Even go back to the Beatles' \\"White Album.\\"  A band can either keep pushing forward, or retreat and go \\"back to their roots\\" when things become hard to top/follow.  What \\"Uno\\" seems to consist of are very catchy songs that all sound the same.  Production-wise, there is nothing interesting on this album whatsoever.  It starts off with a solid 1-2-3-4 punch before \\"Kill the DJ\\" hits us, which may be the worst song ever to appear on a Green Day album.  I'm surprised a song with nearly 20 f-bombs was released as a single, but that may have been an attempt to make people believe there is more diversity to this album than there actually is.  That, and the throwaway \\"Troublemaker,\\" are the low points of the album.<br /><br />While some of the tunes aren't very memorable, it's still a fun andcatchy set of harmless songs.  But repeat listens won't be rewarded with any new insights.  I happened to find \\"AI\\" and \\"21st\\" more melodic and interesting musically.  I reject all the comparisons to \\"Warning\\" that I'm reading about.  \\"Warning\\" took chances in style and instrumentation with harmonica, mandolin, accordion, strings, and more.  If anything this is \\"Insomniac II,\\" just not as good.  \\"Insomniac\\" was a 32-minute onslaught of energy with only \\"Brain Stew\\" to break up the pace.  All those songs sound similar but you don't mind, or even notice, because it was their fourth album (second to many people) and we didn't know at the time all they would be capable of in the years ahead.  Two songs here: \\"Fell For You\\" and \\"Sweet 16\\" sound like they could have been on either \\"39/Smooth\\" or \\"Kerplunk,\\" but \\"Uno\\" is not a return to those days like so many would have you believe.<br /><br />The album is fun, but not as fun as Foxboro.  On that release, Green Day were laid back, enjoying themselves, and letting it all hang out.  This album is carrying the Green Day name which, like \\"21st Century Breakdown,\\" the guys won't allow to appear on a release that is anything less than radio-friendly, polished, and an instant invite to be next to Foo Fighters as the only rock bands allowed to appear at award shows anymore.  The songs on \\"AI\\" and \\"21st\\" have multiple parts, bridges, and seemingly unrelated sections, which add up to an entertaining listen even with the albums as long as they are.  Like I said, when you are going to strip things down and do a straight-forward rock album like this, it can still be a blast, but it also appears like you're phoning it in.  We'll see what they're saving for \\"Dos\\" and \\"Tre.\\"

B004S49YEM|4.0|A cracking read... better than the movie of the same name. Ken Follet is addictive, having read most of his books i intend to read the rest.
B004ZMWUCU|4.0|I liked the book and the unexpected ending.  At times I thought it was a bit wordy but i still enjoyed the story.  I wish Kindle would include titles on each page because I had to review the book listing to remember the title and the story.  When you don't see the cover each time you read a book on Kindle you forget the title.
1455502758|3.0|This book is very, very good - as with most of the author's work.  However, it's also the about the length of a Vanity Fair article yet look at the (kindle) price!  While I don't begrudge the author the length or his family the royalties I do want to take the publishers to task (and hope Amazon will actually print this review):  You had the last work of a truly great man and you decided to rip off his loyal readers!  Shame on you.  This book is the second super short kindle book I've downloaded in the past month (at full price) and I'm done.  I will no longer trust that a kindle version is worth buying until I check the length and reviews.<br /><br />Honestly, I feel bad docking the author's review on this...he wrote a great article.  But I wish another reviewer had done the same and had pointed out the length (they may have more recently; I checked the reviews shortly after the book came out and didn't recheck before buying).  I would not have bought the book had I noted the length - my mistake but I just didn't think a major publisher would do such a thing.  I won't do it again.<br /><br />To anyone wanting to read Mortality - it's touching and brilliant and deeply honest.  A great read.  But don't get the kindle edition!
B007GCY8FS|3.0|Well this is certainly not the best Reacher novel but it is still okay. Plenty of twists and turns. What is missing a bit is Reacher kicking the crap out of the bad guys.
B003IDMURM|4.0|I liked the way that Grisham picturised the social environment of Ford County; it made the book very readable.  That said, it is horrifying to think that such behaviour might still occur in the USA.
B007THA4FI|3.0|I paid $17.99 for the e-book and see that now it is available for $3.00 less.  As irritating as that is, it doesn't hold a candle to the irritation caused by the basic disfunction of the electronic edition of \\"The Casual Vacancy.\\"  The day after I paid the inflated price for the Kindle version, a software revision was made available to correct margin errors.  Since I hadn't started reading it yet, I downloaded the revision.  The revision however fails to hold the bookmarked pages and every time I go back to the book I have to spend time trying to manually locate where I left off reading.  Highly irritating, particularly at the very high, subsequently discounted price.  As for the story itself, it's engrossing enough to keep the reader engaged and is a true departure from Rowling's brilliant \\"Harry Potter...\\" books.  I recommend the book, but do yourself a favor an buy a hardback copy.  The e-book is a real dud.
B000LTAY1U|5.0|The watch was exactly as pictured. Very comfortable to wear and lasts a couple of days if not worn. Very happy with the purchase. Only had the watch two weeks, so I can not write about longevity.
B004PVF95Q|5.0|Elbow never disappoints and it is such a pleasure to listen to beautiful music. Prior to their itunes 2012 festival performance, I have only listened to a handful of songs, especially since they are not widely played here in the U.S. or at least where I live. Their festival performance informed me that I had been missing out on a lot of their music. I am always a fan of music coming from Manchester. Keep it up boys! Please release some new material soon.
B0074D3CAQ|4.0|This is an odd little book about a journey of self-discovery. I am a literary old lady and this was a very suitable book for me.  Well written, if a bit lyrical, with no real surprises for the reader but many for the characters.
B007GCY8FS|1.0|This latest Reacher novel was incredibly disappointing.  I usually wait for the the latest book to come into the library and check it out.  This time I paid for it to be downloaded to my Kindle.  I wish I could ask for my money back.  I had to slog through this novel to get to the end.  I hope the next one is much better!!
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Beautifully written! just as I imagined it would be! I am fascinated by Eva's and Gideon's love story!  Keep writing Sylvia Day because I don't think that many of us want this story to end!
B007MB5OCE|4.0|This book's allusions to 20th century history were admittedly over my head and left me feeling sadly lacking the ability to appreciate many of the jokes.  Advice to readers:  for maximum enjoyment, brush up on who's who in the 20th century before reading this book!  Even though I missed some of (many of?) the historical references, the book was worthwhile in another way for me.  I was inspired by the conclusion that we are all capable of writing our own history, to some extent.  In a factual synopsis of our own past, each one of us has a wealth of experiences which may (or may not) have overlapped experiences of others to form a collective history of humanity.  After all, we ARE all connected, and our life choices can impact the lives of many people.  In an \\"enhanced\\" synopsis of our own past, it is fun to think about what COULD have transpired as a direct result of a choice we made.  Maybe the enhanced version is even more fun than the factual version.  Maybe I need to tell my grandchildren about the time I met the Queen of Istanbulgaria and she told me she had heard about the beautiful clothes I made, and how she needed me to sew her a new dress ... yeah, that's it.
B007FG9LIE|5.0|I was looking at this book on my Kindle, and accidentally bought it . So I thought, I'm suppose to read this book .. It was so good, and couldn't figure out where it was going so that made me read into the night ... Good story and lots of turns in it ... Like that .... So I'm giving this a thumbs up .... A five for me plus five more....
0920668372|5.0|My mother read this book to me when I was young and I bought this for a gift.<br /><br />A nice childrens book.
B008XCF7Y6|5.0|This is great movie. It's fun to watch and it definitely furthers the Starship trooper storyline with heroes, treachery and bonafide battle suit fighting. In my estimation, Roberet Heinlein would be proud :)
B0017SWPXY|5.0|This book tells an amazingly heart-warming, provocative and informative tale-especially for those who love animals. It presents a refreshingly new and different point of view.
B004UID2LC|1.0|I have downloaded and deleted this app numerous times hoping it would fix whatever was wrong. After I did tge required update for the app it began to crash daily, it wouldn't allow me to view any songs before downloading, and now it won't download any songs at all. Can this be fixed or will it have to be removed for good?
B00992CF6W|5.0|i play it with my family, it is a very awesome game! i encourage others to download it, because it's a lot of fun!
B00913DPW2|5.0|The Haunting is the most excellent game. There is an erie feel to the game due mostly to the music I believe. You soon get used to that and that out of the way.<br />Some of the puzzles (most) are very difficult and You'll go to the website to solve a few of them.  I'm working on the tiles right now and the middle one has so many leaves its hard to figure out if they're in right place or not. You'll also collect mothes, coins, and jigsaw puzzle pieces. I'm still collecting them. I have most of the edge pieces in the puzzle (your supposed to end up with a map), the mothes you can buy clues with. Don't bother. They're clever little lines designed to help, but not help. I'm not sure what to coins are for. There's a fortune telling machine I put one coin in and got a fortune out of. No idea how to use it.<br /><br />To sum up: A most excellent game, very difficult even when you go to the website for walk thru, with an erie feel at times. Of course I'm still playing it I think I've covered most of the ground. No idea where it at in terms of the end.
B001NLL8LA|5.0|Have switched from Patterson after all these years since I read my first Reacher book. On my sixth book and can put them down, good action and great stories.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I love it its so much fun I just got it an I'm on level 60 you have to buy it it amazing for children and adults.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|Excellent, easy read.  Author captured my attention from the beginning.  Very detailed and well written.  If you enjoy reading how the Navy Seals train and operate, I highly recommend this book!
B007G3H8Y0|5.0|I've really enjoyed this CD. Both the music and lyrics are done well. My husband who usually doesn't like my taste in music likes it also.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|this app is so much fun, its just like one of those games u see at the fair except its not real, good for peoples of all ages
B000HC2LI0|5.0|I actually bought this for my son. But I loved the series when it was on TV and plan on watching again.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|A great way to integrate world history of the 20th Century with the personal lives of the characters. Knowing how the events affected the characters brings alive the real meaning of the happenings
B0000C9ZBW|4.0|I love this watch. It is thin, light weight, sleek and keeps excellent time. The only negative is the watch band. Although I love that there is no loose strap that hangs out like a leather band, I have found on occasion, that if the mesh clip on the strap gets slightly caught on something, the band latch will open causing the watch to fall. This has happened 3 times to me but fortunately I caught it before it had a chance to hit the floor. Putting the watch on by myself is almost impossible, but it does look beautiful. Just be careful with the band. I would give this watch 5 stars if it weren't for that one negative.
B007HJA5IO|5.0|So far these videos have been as good as the book.  Can't wait to see how they handle all those dragons!
B007UPNA6Y|3.0|I found this Reacher story very average. It laboured on to a slightly frantic finish that did little to lift the overall product.
B009G8GRX6|2.0|I've been a huge fan of Muse since their first album, and frequently use tracks like \\"Knights of Cydonia\\", \\"Super Massive Black Hole\\", and \\"Hysteria\\" as the soundtrack to my work commutes.<br /><br />\\"Black Holes and Revelelations\\" is my favorite album by far, I love every track on the album. \\"Resistance\\" was a bit of a letdown, but still worth picking up, and Exogenesis was a really bold move for the band.<br /><br />\\"The 2nd Law\\" is unfortunately too dramatic of a departure for me. I realize Muse is actively pushing their sound in new directions, but they lost me on this album. None of the tracks have the memorable punch that the old Muse was so famous for. This album comes off as whiny and weak. I couldn't find any tracks worth adding to my playlists. Here's hoping Muse returns to their roots next album.
B00846REIS|5.0|This book has strong suggestions of shades of grey, lots of sex and two people trying to find love. Great read.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|I love to watch the weather channel because you do not know what kind of weather it is today it might be a stormy day
B008M87GJK|5.0|The BBC News app is a convenient way to keep abreast of world events from a different perspective than US media outlets. Their coverage is comprehensive, the service is ad-free, and the app is easy to navigate and customize to your personal preferences.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|I loved Bared to You. There was no doubt about getting  Reflected in You as soon as it's released. In fact, i pre-ordered it. That was a good experience. Waking up with Gideon waiting on my Kindle. >.&lt;<br />I don't know how Sylvia Day did it. Bared to you was already very good. But Reflected in You is even much better. More second characters involved. Some issues are cleared. And if you read every word and every line, you'll have your answer for everything at the end. I love it that Sylvia doesn't leave us hanging wondering 'what?!' or 'how?!' or 'why?!'<br />It's all just because of Gideon's love for Eva: I'd kill for you, give up everything I own for you... but I won't give you up.<br />I think I  see a wedding coming next book. Ah... Can't wait for this year to end. ;)
B004PYDBEO|5.0|This book does a great job providing a lot of information about why fractal theory is interesting and useful and it does so without using any complicated equations throughout the text.<br /><br />At the same time it does a good job in the appendicies explaining the equations if you are interested.<br /><br />A lot of great stories on how the equations and theory came to be and the side stories contribute a lot as far as different approaches to solving problems and valuing financial instruments.<br /><br />I would highly recommend this book.  A quick read considering how complicated the subject can be.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I wasn't going to read this series, but a freind of mine started reading the series. She said the writing was good. I am now on the third book, this has been a really good story & I recomend it to everyone.
B007GCY8FS|4.0|Slow action. Too much descriptive and non-plot stuff. However OK.<br /><br />I can't see Tom Cruise as Jack Reacher! NO WAY!
B006HL9G10|5.0|the bells are stunning on this timer and there are several to choose from. I have had several meditation timers before but none have had the flexibility of this timer. I also like the way it keeps statistics. they are of course beside the point...but still fun. Works great both on my kindle fire and my galaxy.
B003VANOFY|5.0|Before I begin my brief review...<br />***DOWNLOAD THE DRIVERS FROM THE LOGITECH SITE!***<br /><br />This is imperative as the autoupdate feature does not pick up the latest version of the Logitech Gaming Software.<br /><br />The ability to play corded or wireless is an awesome benefit within itself. With that being said I absolutely adore this headset.<br /><br />I would recommend it to gamers/music enthusiasts alike. They provide rich sound and depth without that annoying tinny effect I have experienced with past headsets. Yes the headset could be a bit more durable but to be honest I've fallen asleep with these on a couple of occasions and they have 0 wear to them. So as long as you're not super rough with your gear you should be fine! With the aforementioned Logitech Gaming Software (from their driver site), programming your headset is simply/intuitive and can be achieved quickly once you get the hang of the software.<br /><br />I haven't received any complaints from others about my mic at all. I have been told it is very loud and clear - and I'm not a loud speaker.<br />This headset provides a nice comfort and cups the ears well without constricting itself around your head so tightly you frequently have to shift around or just completely forgo a headset. The micro usb fits pretty snuggly into the headset - I've found myself actually using a bit of strength from removal at times :).<br /><br />All in all I am happy with my purchase and would recommend to those who are looking for a great sounding headset and enjoy the ability to roam free without having to peel your headset off when getting up from the computer.
B007GCY8FS|5.0|As always, Lee Child's Jack Reacher novel delivers just what Reacher fans have come to expect.  Impossible to put down!
B007GCY8FS|5.0|This Lee Child book returns to the style I'm accustomed to and enjoy. Up to date Reacher is what I look for and the Wanted Man fulfills that need.
B008MG1E4A|4.0|Initially it was hard to get into but it was a very well written book. I'm still debating on things that are written concerning our military. I truly believe less is said the better. Why show our type of weapons?? And tactics. Not something our enemies need to know.
B0091REZMW|5.0|I've been playing on my Android phone forever and glad to see it here! You do not have to spend money! I'm on level 56 and didn't spend anything! There is lots to do while waiting for energy to load! Keep at it, you will love it as well! The only negative is that it force closes on the phone a lot..hopefully it won't here!
1401235417|5.0|I am a fan of batman, there I said it. Of course, I must be or I wouldn't have read this. I highly recommend if you too are a batman fan. It stays true to the bat and it stays true story we all know and love. I am on pins and needles waiting for the next volume!
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I thought this trilogy was going to be really trashy, but I was so wrong! Lots of unsuspecting surprises and a great love story.
1423140605|5.0|Brilliant book, as always, another great title by the amazing Rick Riordan- with the Rickhanger, of course, leaving me to suffer for another year till the next book comes out- but it'll be worth it in the end!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I wasn‘t sure reading Fifty Shades of Grey would have a storyline and that I would be reading Porn on paper. but to my surprise it followed and plot, and i was more than happy to buy the next too books.
B005PMNBNG|5.0|Hurry Up We're Dreaming is fully loaded with approximately 63 minutes of pure listening enjoyment. The music has an energy that quietly builds throughout each song. The overarching feeling is an air of optimism and hope, as well as a longing for something unknown. The theme seems to be about suburban youth longing to explore urban life and the world beyond their field of vision. Don't take my word for it though. Give it a listen in its entirety on [...] and experience it yourself. Then you can buy it on Amazon. Just an FYI, I waited four months before buying it, waiting for the price to drop. During those four months, I never found a better price than whatever price was listed at Amazon. I purchased this mp3 for seven ninety nine.    favorite song: raconte-moi une histoire  least fav song: splendor (although I am in the minority on this one)
B0023SDPS6|4.0|I bought this book by Craig Johnson because I'd seen the series on TV and loved it. I read somewhere that the series had left out the humor and they were right. This Longmire guy has a dry sense of humor I love and he has just enough rough patches to make him a pleasure to have around. I haven't finished this one but am trying not to buy all of Longmire's stories at once.
0060254920|2.0|The book was great, but came damaged. I won't send it back because my daughter loves it and  it takes too long
B007TBZ63Y|3.0|Another entertaining adventure by Riordan.<br /><br />It seemed there was not a dull page in this entire book.  Our heroes went from one crisis/adventure to the next, which was almost a bit exhausting to read.  On the one hand, there wasn't much need for character development because for the most part, these were all characters that readers of the series should know well.  On the other hand however, all of the non-stop action made me roll my eyes a bit at the \\"oh no here we go again\\" battles between the demi-gods and their enemy du jour.<br /><br />It was nice to see each of the demi-gods have their moment and watch them work together as they built their super Greek-Roman all-star team. But I found myself missing some of the supporting players that have made past stories in this universe so much fun.<br /><br />And then of course, there is the inevitable cliff-hanger at the end.  I've read that, like the Percy Jackson series, the Heroes of Olympus will also be a 5 book series, so the ending wasn't a surprise- it was clear from the beginning that one story might get wrapped up while another one only got started, but it does get tedious.
B006LSZECO|3.0|Reading this novel was similar to watching a train wreck in slow motion. What made it interesting was the picking apart not only of the dissolution of a remarkably dysfunctional marriage, but the screwy dysfunctional societal norms that create them. I admit, I really enjoyed the book for that. And it is a page turner to be sure. Since finishing the book, I've read criticisms about the ending. It fits though. I agree with other readers that said the story starts to become formulaic and a bit of a letdown half way through--not because of what's revealed, but only because it's so cliche. Then again, without revealing anything, yes it's cliche, but \\"it\\" happens all the time. I can't quite decide if the author is brilliant or just warped. Maybe a little of both.
B005V2S7FW|5.0|I love this app.  You can install it on your phone, computer, Kindle fire.  It remembers and logs you in to secure sights.  This is a fantastic password program.  I highly recommend it!
B000TERFGO|5.0|I am shocked that I would be asked to review anything by John Coltrane nevertheless this classic Blue Train.  This is an awesome performance - like I needed to say that.  On the recording side - the quality of the mp3 download is terrific.  Now I'll get back to listening.
B0090P98Z4|4.0|Overall, a great little sword &amp; board, hack &amp; slash time waster. Glu Mobile tends to put out very good looking, polished, mobile platform games and, this one is no exception. I have only 2 issues. One with this game specifically and one with all Glu Mobile games. With this game specifically, the movement control seems almost to sensitive and makes precision character placement a challenge. With all Glu Mobile games, the only way to acquire the best items in any game is to pay real money for Glu coins/tokens enough to buy the item in game. While I understand the financial profit model, I still think it should be possible to achieve/acquire the best, if you're willing to invest the time. Glu will make up the supposed lose from the additional player base that's created by the hype.
B007SGM084|3.0|This was not what I thought. She turns a kinky man into a wimp. I was told this book is really twisted, but it was a waste of time. The more you read, the more she makes him normal. If you r looking for twisted and kinky, DO NOT READ THIS!
B007GCY8FS|3.0|I have never encountered a Lee Child Jack Reacher novel that I could put down once having started.  But some are more gripping and descriptive than others.  This one came in a bit below par.  A large part of the interest stems from his selection of the locale and description of the area which seems to suggest that he spends some time viewing the site of the story.  The scenes in this story were a bit drab and dry with so much time on the highway.  Still it was enjoyable.
B007FG9LIE|4.0|I liked this book. It is kind of far fetched. However it is interesting. It starts out a little slow but gets more interesting as it moves on.
B0097GVJWQ|3.0|The story was sort of interesting, but the moving back and forth through screens/locations became rather dull quickly since there didn't seem to be a flow or logical reason for movement.  Instead, the movement between screens seemed to be more of a way to extend the game without adding real content.  On the other hand, a couple of the puzzles were fun and the hidden object activities were an easy and nice way to relax.  I used a Kindle Fire and, occasionally, the game hung up; I just waited and it finally would catch and move forward.  Big Fish seems to be less than creative when it comes to new types of puzzles inside the games.  Compared to other game developers, the quality just isn't there for the price.  Anuman has more creative H.O. screens, especially those that slide/tilt.  Fire Maple has better graphics.  Mumbo-Jumbo games are far more clever.  G5 are weird, but more challenging.  Nevertheless, since I go through these games at the rate of 2 / week and am running out, I'd like to see more like Treasure Seekers and Dragon Wheel, but fewer like Enigmatis.
B006LSZECO|5.0|This book had me on the edge of my seat the while time. Highly recommend. I hope future readers enjoy as much as I did.
B008TMA1LY|5.0|I absolutely love this game! :) very fun and addictive. I play it during my college classes breaks. no shame
B007THA4FI|4.0|as a huge harry potter fan i could not wait for this book. the story was good and kept me reading but if you are looking for magic this is not the book for you. it is a story like a maeve binchy only darker. i do hope she continues to write.
B007GCY8FS|5.0|A great read as always with Lee Child. Very interesting with lots of twists and turns. I can't wait for his next Reacher novel.
B0095R76EW|5.0|Unconventional and hilarious. This movie is long for a rom-com but It is worth every minute. I ended up watching it twice in 24 hours and still laughed throughout.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I love it and use it almost every day! so great when there's nothing better going on or a day off work!
B00753MBHA|5.0|This is a great album. This is the second album from the re-united Accept and new lead singer Mark Tornillo. The title track stands out, but the whole album is solid all the way through. Outstanding work for guys who've been in the business so long, even more that they now have Mark. Great metal album; heavy, lots of great guitar work, good tunes. Highly recommend.
B004Q7CIFI|5.0|a real page turner; jammed w. real details about what happened.i remember when this event happened and king put in the missing parts. can't wait for his next mystery thriller.
B0058VA2U4|5.0|Only just reviewing it now (10/2012), bought it when it came out; this is a GREAT metal album. It was worth the wait. Most especially worth it for Fight 'em Til You can't, I'm Alive, In the End, The Giant and Judas Priest. Great, varied styles; fantastic musicanship all around. You should already have this album if your a metal head like me. Just had to finally get my 2 cents in on how great it is. Other reviews have all the details song wise etc., just buy it already.
B00884GR0W|4.0|It was a very good game finally built a house, but then the kindle exited out of the game. and every time I go in the game it does the same thing every minute
B000B8I8X2|4.0|This a compliation album for Roadrunner Records of the various members of some of their bands all playing together in different songs. This is a GREAT album. It is now 2012 and this cd came out in 2005 and is still the best compliation album in the metal scene (even over Nuculear Blast's), in my opinion. So many of the songs here are really great. In the Fire is my absolute favorite. The subject matter (Salem Witch trials) combined with King Diamond on vocals (high voice and low range playing the two different groups; the witch and the townspeople) - it's just a FANTASTIC metal tune on all accounts. It is worth the purchase of this CD alone. The Enemy, Independent and Army of the Sun are also really great tunes and standouts as well. You see styles combied here that you never normally do. Buy this, I don't care what year it is you are reading this review; buy it.

B008N5UX9M|1.0|Steve Harris is and always will be the God of Bass; I'm a huge Iron Maiden fan. However, I truly hate this album on multiple levels. The lead singer is just awful. I mean no offense to him, but he can't sing (in my opinion) and I also hate his singing voice (really really hate it). I was constantly in shock at how much I truly disliked his voice and vocal style. Putting that aside, the album is more of a rock album than anything metal or hard rock. Polar opposite of Maiden, which is fine; I just hate it. The songs don't go anywhere or do anything for me, even ignoring my hatred of the singer's voice. To be totally honest here, I actually ejected it from my tray around song 7. I normally never do that and I never would write reviews on half listened to albums, except for this one. I mean nothing against Harris or the band, but for God's sake stay far away from this effort.  Way cool album cover and title though.

My kids have watched this several times and the rental is now about as much as purchasing it outright. This seems like a scam to me and very unlike my other experiences with Amazon video.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|i love this game if u like like puzzles to this game is for u!<br />it is addicting and worth your time it is a great and wonderful game that gets harder and harder u can start on any level u want to get it!!!
B007GCY8FS|1.0|have read every on of the Jack Reacher novels and really enjoyed them all until i received this one on my kindle.  It did not have the spellbinding tale that we were used to.  Really dragged along.  Sorry i wasted my money on this one.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Although i really enjoyed this book and this series, i wanted to write a review for several reasons. Firstly,this is not even remotely indicative of what a true BDSM lifestyle is. Secondly, it really displays an abusive relationship mixed up with some intense infatuation.  That being said, I love this series on a purely fantastical basis, the same as i would for any good Ann Rice novella. I think it is a very cute and kitchy series if read with an open mind and without thinking that it is any reflection of the real world. These books should be read like Twilight for adults, and readers should marinate over the similarities betwen the two series.o
B007GCY8FS|4.0|\\"Wanted Man\\" did what all Reacher novels do; put him down the road a piece from his last episode and walla : a new Reacher breacher. I liked this novel as well as most and better than some, because the gist of the story revolved around a small cast of characters (the four in the car + 2) and a restricted set (the car or cars) with and plenty of twists along the way. Of course they were interspersed with plenty of \\"Reacher facts\\" so bingo, a very good story.<br /><br />The ending pages, and conclusion, were typical Reacher, escalating perhaps beyond realism, or at least my imagination (but only at times).  But again, that is Reacher.<br /><br />As always, after one of his riveting reads, I sit back and reflect on any underlying message. In this case the end run was a surprise; an eye opener.<br /><br />Read it, you'll enjoy.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|This was a very entertaining book. Classic sci-fi. Please write more! I can hardly wait to see what happens next.
B007SGM084|5.0|The best story line I have seen in a long time. I couldnt put them down and easily finished reading all three in record time. Would definetly buy more books from E.L. James.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I've never read a complete novel book, but when it came to Fifty Shades of Grey I finished it in 4 days!! Awesome book!! P.S: Some parts are very explicit, so please have an open mind!!
B007GCY8FS|4.0|I count Lee Child among my favorite authors and was eagerly awaiting \\"A Wanted Man\\".  So eager that I chose to purchase it for my Kindle rather than wait to get it at the public library where I volunteer. Reacher is a super hero and is right up there with Mitch Rapp, Elvis Cole, Joe Pike, Lucas Davenport,Kurt Wallander,Dave Robicheaux and Scot Harvath all of whom really enhance my love of reading.  Perhaps this venture by Jack was not quite as good as some of Child's best but it was right up there in plot twists and superhuman efforts.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|this items is good to have it helps in watching when ur kindle is low,  so u can plug it in.  before there is nothing there no more charge.  I do recommand this item.  thank u. Mrs.  lopez
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I watched the actual movie before I purchased the trilogy book for my kindle fire.<br />The price was better for kindle than it was for a Sony eBook reader.<br />The book was excellent.<br />There was a lot of symbolism.<br />A lot of the story makes you look at the problems in the world today. It was so fascinating that I read the entire trilogy in 10 days.<br />I would rank it with the Harry Potter and Lord of the Rings series.
B007UPNA6Y|3.0|I have read with great pleasure all of Lee Childs' Reacher series but have noticed the quality of the last few has not been up to the earlier ones. I am sure Mr.Childs has the capability to give Jack a rest and come up with a new character in a different setting which would enable him to weave different but equally fiendishly clever plots. I believe his faithful followers would certainly give him a chance to establish a new persona.
B008OOYALE|5.0|I love this game it is so I love it so much it is the best game I love it so.
B002DOSBMK|5.0|I love how Drizzt struggles with his past and the world in which he struggles to live.  The depth of his character makes him endearing and has you rooting for his success.  The characters are strong and the plot is unique and unpredictable.  I could not put the book down!  It's a great read!  One of the best by this author to date!
B009329Y30|5.0|Well done, first of Ravi Mehta's works I have seen and he produced a really excellent film, good story, great production values, simple and sweet, almost European-
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|It started off a bit slow but picked up at the end and was an exciting read.  Really loved this series- I read it with my 10yo son and we enjoyed all the books.
B008Y2IU12|5.0|I enjoyed the presentation of this move and the twist on the interpretation of the story.  It was well planned and held my attention.  I recommend this movie for  viewing by teens and above.
B0063IH60K|4.0|just challenging enough to keep me from putting it down. fun to win a lot. not boring. don't like the adds but that is whet you get for free.  next time I will pay more
B00992CF6W|5.0|epicly awesome just needs more updates. until it is the best app in the whole kindle fire app store LOL.
B000HC2PCM|4.0|There's nothing like seeing and hearing the legend in person, but next best, this CD contains a lot of classic Merle.  Worth the acquisition !
B007LHXQEW|5.0|Has investigative drama, cheap fun, pyro tech great cars hot people bad guys mushy stuff gun swords not much not 2 like
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Simply,easy to use basic calculator. I have had it for a while and it still works great. I would highly recommend it.
B007MB5OCE|5.0|Enjoyed the 100 year old man from start to finish..a fun read, but with enough history to make the story ring true!
0316228532|2.0|This is a harsh book about the reality of divisions in small towns. There was substance at first then the book became to scattered. The use of such crass language was not necessary. The characters were over the top. I  don't live in the UK but a small town is a small town. Big fish, little fish mentality is not explored as in-depth because there were to many characters.I would not recommend buying this book but borrowing it from the library...
B0083GQ2A0|3.0|The Grey started out very promising.  The film attempted to portray the wolves as beasts who rule their domain, and the humans are just unluckly souls who happened to survive a horrible plane crash.  Sound good, right?  Before the wolves even ate one person, I had already picked out who be eaten and in what order.  A good film, would NOT be predictable.  However, if you like watching people be tortured and then killed... this is the flick for you!  If you enjoy hopelessness; well, it's a got a good does of that too.
B0061PEAUY|3.0|Story line is interesting if a bit morbid. Seemed like Ms. Reichs was meandering<br /><br />in an effort to generate a creditable read. I now know more about diamond mining<br /><br />in the NWT than before rading the book. It's a good read but not up to her best<br /><br />level of writing.
B008NCSZQ8|5.0|The Avengers does everything you want a movie to do... entertain for each second we're watching!  Each Super Hero stays true to their character, and watching the Hulk have a fit is just so much fun!!  The plot is good (as far as aliens are attacking us again can be), but even Tony Stark takes a little poke at the plot, and so all is forgiven!  Brilliant acting, great CG, wonderful script; yes, I would recommend this to anyone who ever wanted to see a good flick.
B005LLSNNE|5.0|LOVE THIS THIS!  It's amazing Tons of action, and the romance between Jax and Tara is incredible. Definitely a show to watch! Make sure to start with season 1 so you know what is happening!
B007KQ6XYY|5.0|I really like this game. Even though I think the original cut the rope game is best this game is still really good. I think its worth 1$ and would recommend this to anyone.
B000LB7G00|5.0|I bought a SpaceNavigator for work.  I don't know how I got anything done without it.  I use it exclusively with Mastercam, and have not had any problems with compatibility.  Every feature is customizable, from sensitivity to button function, and can be saved to specific users and programs.  Without a doubt, my productivity has improved solely based on the addition of the this product to my work environment.  I would recommend this product to anyone involved in CAD or CAM processes.
B005ZMUXDC|5.0|I love this movie. I highly recommend this for purchase. Pascal is hilarious and the while movie is just a great interpretation of Rapunzel.
B0071BGOJC|5.0|Ken Follet remains in great shape. Nevertheless how long he kept us waiting for the second book of the Century trilogie, it certainlly worth it. Great plot, well devollop charaters, cinematographic scenes. I wish all the books I read would be half as good as this one.
B007B6VOG0|5.0|My wife wanted me to get this for her and after hearing it I really liked it. The whole album is great.
B008JFUUQ2|5.0|if you like glee this is the movie for you i love this movie i have already seen it 2 times it is very funny well worth the money
B00846REIS|5.0|I loved this book and in my opinion much better than Fifty. Sylvia Day is a fabulous writer....I just started her new book. I'm totally into the characters:-) Awesome read
B0086700CM|3.0|When I first saw it an the app store I was so excited! Finally I thought but when I started to play the game it keep being buggy need to update keeps making me die!
B007GCY8FS|2.0|Not as well written as earlier works.  Same formula that is getting old. Reacher is just not as credible as he was in earlier novels.
B0015DWJX2|5.0|Unique read through letters between inspiring and delightful characters. I loved Juliet and Sidney. Guernsey is a future trip for me
B007XKEY6Q|3.0|its really addictive at first and then after playing for a week straight, its totally boring so that's why I suggest GET THE FREE VERSION!!!
B009329ZF2|5.0|I loved this movie! Good action, good special effects reasonable character development, cool premise. Say what you will, I thought this movie was excellent and thoroughly entertaining. Watch with a chicken burrito!
B005K01VZS|5.0|I very much enjoyed reading Have a Little Faith and have recommended it to several friends.  Having first read The Five People You Meet In Heaven I looked forward to Have a Little Faith and found it to be of the same high quality.  Love a book that leaves me with meaningful thoughts long after the book is finished.  I recommend this book to everyone!  I purchased this book from Amazon for my Kindle.
B00243FQFA|4.0|Wonderful sad to see it end great team Atlantis took the sg universe further and the base stood on its own very well I will hope to be as happy with the new sg universe.
B008FTAAG2|5.0|They added some industrial/dub elements into their sound. I like it, but I wonder how they can pull it off live.
B004T32SOK|5.0|Awesome product. Very easy to use.  I use it for both work and personal use. Getting my wife on box as well.
B008PNBU30|2.0|I'm not really sure what to say...Three Days Grace has always been one of my favorite bands. Loved the first CD, loved One X...thought Life Starts Now was...okay (I HATED 3 songs but the rest grew on me despite being much weaker and having a much more pop-rock feel that I wasn't a fan of.)...and I was interested to hear Transit of Venus. I have seen them live 3 times although I skipped the last time because I just couldn't sit through douchebag opening band My Darkest Days...<br />The lead-off single from TOV isn't mind-blowing, but it's...okay...<br />Then I downloaded the full thing. I have never been so disappointed with a follow-up in my life. I couldn't find a single song I liked. I found myself unchecking song after song in ITunes to skip, but still hopeful...until I wasn't...<br />The vocals are the same, but they are slightly off. The songs are a weird type of experimental sound that I wouldn't call rock. Eclectic maybe? Sign of the Times has a beginning that describes this exactly. It eventually builds into a rock song that is somehow off the mark. The High Road is generic, but it grows on you. Maybe if you like ballads, but I do not. Operate is painful.<br />Not a fan of the lyrics this time around either, and that is always one of the most important things to me.<br />Overall just a mediocre blend of experimental semi-rock that you might expect in the corner of a small dark club. Just because it isn't super-commercial drivel (a common complaint with the first single off of the last CD, Break), does not mean it's good.<br />If this is their way of maturing, I will be sadly calling myself a fan of the older 3DG.<br />But in light of Adam- the former lead singer- leaving the band he had this to say \\"\\"on the record Transit of Venus there's maybe one or two songs that actually do come from my heart, but a lot of songs have been written just for radio.\\" And if even the former lead singer feels that way about the album he put out, that says a lot.<br />I am sure they will have rabid fans that will love whatever they put out and get angry because anyone dares to NOT love it...and those are the fans that should buy this. Or download it.<br />As for me, I dislike the new singer, I hate the Nickleback esque My Darkest Days and everything they stand for (Kurt Cobain would be rolling in his grave at the turn around back to the meaningless music and lyrics from the 80's hair bands), and i will not ever be buying another 3DG album. But I do look forward to seeing what new music Adam Gontier puts out in the future.they will have rabid fans that will love whatever they put out and get angry because anyone dares to NOT love it...and those are the fans that should buy this.

And recomend you read it as soon as you have time!!!!
B007GCY8FS|5.0|This book is as good as all of the others.  Once you start almost impossible to put down.  Lee Child is amazing--man causes me not to get any sleep until I finish the book I am reading--cannot wait until the next one--
B003E8P9G0|4.0|The Red Pyramid is an excellent adventure. It is funny, exciting, and nerve-racking!  In this book Carter and Sadie Kane lose their father to a mysterious firey man and discover they have magical powers. They are depressed until they discover they ha e an Egyptian god and a powerful magician or two on their side. They travel thhrough deserts and mountains looking for thier dad and the firey man. Soon they learn how much they really care about each other. And they realize that they have to make sacrifices but they must always have hope.  This book truly is a good book, it is funny, full of action, and has many great caracters.  My only problem with this book was how complicated some of it was. It had some hard things to remember and get used to, and in most of the book things were just going on to quickly. But all together this book was a really great book, that I'm sure most of the young Percy Jackson fans out there will love!
B00992CF6W|5.0|Minecraft Pocket Edition is a fun if limited version of Minecraft.  But, that's to be expected.  The game is slowly catching up with the PC version, and limited storage makes the world a limited size, but the core of the game and what makes it fun remain intact.  Play it.
B007MB5OCE|4.0|This book surprised me.  It has delightful characters, who are developed as the book proceeds, much as you meet someone and only get to know their history over time.  The plot was faschinating, and the dialog made me laugh.  I recommend it for anyone looking for a light read, that is entertaining.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I have had nothing but success with this app.  I stopped doing Pinterest a ling time ago but picked it back up when I came across the Kindle App for it!  Love it!!!!
B0098VYKSA|2.0|Yuck. Kristen Stewart prettier than Charlize??? Please! Not even a good story. Don't waste your time or money. Disney is better than this.
B009GENZKS|2.0|It was pretty boring really... Not much of a plot.. nothing new as far as the resident evil creepies are conserned, no crazy lake monster or anything neat. I miss the old RE with the walking dead, not thies plant a seed head pop off wigglie things. The series has taken a turn for the worse, its time to get back to bacis and get some creative ideas going.
B002MFX0RQ|5.0|very good dvd of this movie, movie is just as funny as I remembered it to be.  would definatlry reccomend buying this copy.
B0017TFLBQ|5.0|I received the item ahead of time, without problems, is new and good quality<br />The strategy game is, it's fun, I recommend it.
B006BZ8WAI|4.0|I have been a Korn fan since I was very young and the new sound blended with the new dub is done just right in this case
B0095R64AO|3.0|This movie is a black comedy or more so a drama with some comedic elements. The movie deals with very adult life situations.
0762445262|4.0|I bought two of these.  I bought one as a Christmas present for my best friend who just loves super hero stuff. I bought the other to give to my nephew for Christmas as a night light for his room.  I can't wait to see him open it!  He is really going to love it.  This was part of the buy 4 for 3 promotion Amazon was having.  I'm very glad I took advantage of it.
B007THA4FI|5.0|This book is very character dominated, it took me about 5 chapters just to figure out who everyone was, but after that I couldn't put the book down. I found all the characters not necessarily likable but for the most part they felt real. There seemed to be a bit of poetic justice in the end when Howard has a heart attack and ends up being in the hospital for a long time.  The ending left me hanging a bit and I wish that it had continued on a bit more and not ended on such a sad note. I kept hoping that Barry Fairbrother would end up not being dead and would pop up at the council meeting when they voted on the Fields and Bellchapel. I thoroughly enjoyed the book the writing was excellent and the entire book was very descriptive. I found a few typos in the book mainly parentheses that shouldn't have been there. I was amazed, however, at the number of one star reviews from people who hadn't even read the book and were only complaining about the price. If you don't like the price don't buy it, but don't give it a one star review when you haven't even read it. Reviews should be for one's opinion about the book not for venting because you think it's too high priced. I thought it was well worth the $17 because the hardcover was $35 at the bookstore. I will definitely read it again. Can't wait for her next book!
B007THA4FI|1.0|I'm afraid I just can't go into the lengthy reviews that some people had. There isn't that much to say about this book. I thought the plot was dull, although I did enjoy reading the British term for things and their way of turning a phrase. While I loved the HP series (and yes I DID know this would be completely different), I was very dissatisfied with this overall.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|You just have to finish the series once you have started and this is a great final book...I really enjoyed the entire series so much I'm thinking of re-reading it.  I might just collect a little more insight now that I know the out come.. great read.  I love it when I enjoy a book so much I hustle through everyday just to find a few minutes here and a few minutes there to read...I had no trouble sitting in Doc offices the entire time I was reading this series.  Love all three books... enjoy!
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|this game is almost better than the real thing. it is oddly addicting and a great way to kill time.
B007MB5OCE|4.0|This was a fun read, even though it tended to get a bit silly, making fun of world events and leaders.  After a bit, I came to understand that the author's style was fully intending to be sarcastic, as well as inane.  So I just kept on reading, being fully entertained and laughing out loud.  The writer capitalizes on his career as a journalist and researcher to bring to the reader a series of ironic and tongue-in-cheek events, in a rather loosely built plot.  But that is purely the author's intent.  Trying to read more into the plot or characters is nonsense and would spoil the sheer pleasure of this clever persiflage.<br /><br />The premise for the tale is that a very elderly, widely traveled Swede decides to ditch his 100th birthday, at old folks home.  Hence he escapes back in the big, wide world, from which he had made so many interesting friends and captured many unique experiences.  Could one fault him for such a spur-of-the-moment decision?  Not I!<br /><br />Through a series of ten decades, in which the main character accidentally runs into fame and notoriety, the maturing man learns that life is truly full of ups and downs.  The plot is thick with clever irony and tongue-in-cheek comments about the machinations of world politics.  In all of this, the author has created a man who takes all life events in stride, taking the good with the bad, having a positive approach to life and becoming the quintessential carpe diem sort of guy.  Thus, after failing to show up for his 100th birthday bash at the rest home, the author invents a series of well-placed mishaps, flashbacks, crazy characters and mad escapes and to bring the centenarian \\"home\\" to continue to mix and mingle with a madcap group of fellow existentialists.<br /><br />If you're looking for great literature, this is not your kind of read. If you need a good, long-winded laugh to brighten your day, do go for this tale.  The author makes no apologies about his intent to entertain, except for the fact thatone has to wonder if all the world's major events aren't just results of accidentally placed people and their circumstance.  Hmmmmm.....
B00785P2QC|5.0|I personally love this game. the minute I sat down playing it, I got hooked!! this is a fun game to play when you justice need to sit back and relax for a while. if your looking for a good game, you just found one.
B009AJDDQU|4.0|I am a big sci-fi fan anyway....books, movies and TV series. I bought Prometheus, unseen, as Ridley Scott was all I needed to know. Great look to the movie, and a story that moves along nicely. Set up for the next round. A prequel of sorts that may tie in to an older premise. I have the HD copy, but will play on a standard setting...a win win.
B00976MZYM|5.0|I am beyond pleased with this album! Carly proved to be much much more than a \\"1-hit Wonder\\". This album is in constant rotation along with Slaughterhouse, Talib Kweli and Lupe Fiasco (:
0316228532|1.0|Not good.  It's a soap opera in a book.  And it's not a good soap opera.<br /><br />Only person I could like for the first half--which is as far as I could go--was Barry, who dies on page 5.  Endless dissections of people's feelings, motivations, etc. become quickly tiresome and tedious.  Hard to continue it, but I kept hoping that something magic would happen.  It didn't.<br /><br />Harry Potter was the magnum opus.  Maybe Ms. Rowling has another one in her, but this isn't it.
B0015DYIH2|4.0|I was thrilled with this book and thought it wrapped the story up nicely, as far as it's gone so far. I almost didn't read this one, because the number of negative reviews is so much higher than with the other books. I'm glad I ignored the naysayers, who obviously have issues with detail - or a lack thereof. Nothing in this last book was out of place. Again, we're reading stories about vampires, werewolves, shape shifters, and the supernatural, so I think if you're willing to suspend your disbelief enough you could certainly put aside your concerns about the \\"dysfunction\\" surrounding the relationships in the book. Everything contained within this book was set up to be realistic. Bella's powers were quick to develop, but the author set her up as an odd exception to every rule from Book 1 as a human and well through her transformation. The change was detailed, as was the battle (or lack thereof) with the Volturi, and I am glad things ended up the way they did!
B0086700CM|5.0|Intially I could not believe how good the graphics were. Then I discovered how fun it was to 'run the course'  I am still amazed how humans could figure out how to developn this game.
B0097GVJWQ|1.0|App will not install on kindle fire even after I have tried several times.  game looks interesting if I was able to play.  waste of money that I paid
B007FEFLTO|4.0|My husband and I both enjoyed Winter of the World, perhaps not as much as Fall of Giants, but we both think Follett was up to the task of dealing with families with different perspectives during the war years.  Looking forward to Book III - wish we didn't have to wait two years.
B008O037RG|2.0|Millions of people adore Mumford & Sons, finding their sound to be much more than pleasant folksy tunes but rather something like a revelatory, deeply meaningful expression of passion.<br /><br />When I first heard M&S, I, too, found them revelatory. It was intensely refreshing to hear popular music that has soul--so much soul that they couldn't help but to project it at the tops of their lungs. It was a desperately needed reply to the current \\"I don't care / we do what we want\\" irreverent dance-pop glitz ethos.<br /><br />Many listens later, I see M&S differently. The music reliably invokes excitement but, in doing so, it finds no space for subtlety or understatement. Their roots are in Back Country bluegrass and folk -- genres that are all about stories -- but in M&S's music there are no stories. Rather, this album is a lot like U2's City of Blinding Light: Biblical imagery expressed in generic terms. A flailing attempt to capture spirituality. Or maybe just to prevent boredom. Instead of stories intended to shake and inspire, we get posturing and shouting intended to excite. After a while, all the excitement becomes exhausting and empty, not unlike the dance-pop glitz they oppose.<br /><br />I believe people are starved for deeper rewards than Maroon 5 and their dance-pop contemporaries offer, and I believe that's why M&S are the top-selling musicians in the country (and by a wide margin), because they give the instant impression of heartfelt folky soulfulness. But the truth, revealed after enough listens, is that they are closer to stadium rock. To find deeper rewards, you have to look to the folk / bluegrass / celtic roots that have inspired them: Bob Dylan or Van Morrison, or even more recent acts like Ray LaMontagne or Amos Lee. Their music may not be as instantly pleasurable or exciting as M&S's, but if you give it your patience and attention, you just might find rewards that are far more precious than excitement.
B008XG1X18|4.0|first time I tried to use it didn't work at all and constantly got an error.... now it is fantastic!  I almost like it better on my kindle over a computer.
1577314808|5.0|anyone who finds their way to this book  and gets it is indeed blessed  read it again  .....in the chapter on portals  it has the best explanation of chi  i have ever seen<br /><br />also  at the end of that chapter it has an explanation of death  that could bring peace to many
B004FOA84A|2.0|I couldn't find anymore clues, and there is no episode/game guide to help me go forward like the big fish games.
B007HGPBRC|4.0|It is a short book and does not have much of a story....except death that is and all the horrible trappings that go with. I don't think that I will ever forget the ending. Stark naked reality that hits you where it hurts, your own mortality and the fear that this could happen to you. Ask not for whom the bell tolls.....
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I totally loved this book one of the best books i have read in a long time probably the best SERIES .
B006LSZECO|3.0|... But this is one of those books.  I can't speak to the overall quality of the work because I couldn't get past the first thirty pages.  The two first-person narrators are so unlikeable, and their viewpoints are so whining and self-involved, that I just didn't have any desire to spend any more time with them.  Understand, I don't object to unpleasant or dark or troubled or downright evil narrators:  if I did, I couldn't enjoy Faulkner, or Chandler, or John Cheever, or Joyce Carol Oates.  What I object to here are two unlikeable, self-involved, whining, and UNINTERESTING narrators.  Both of these people are what used to be called, in the pre-irony days, total losers.  They deserve each other, and after spending thirty pages listening to their crap, I don't really care if he killed her, she left, he left, she committed suicide, he committed suicide, the father did it, the sister did it, or nothing really happened at all.  And this is the best selling book on Amazon kindle?  Sheesh.

B008MG1E4A|4.0|The book was an interesting and quick read.  It provides some interesting insight into the challenges of being one of our nations front line troops without getting overly technical.  I'll read it again in the future.

B0071XO8RA|5.0|Very well written. Great characters and plot. Most books I read now days are good but I can't find the time to read. I made time to read this book. Great job Mr  Howey keep them coming. I just downloaded First Shift Legacy and it is just as good. Thanks again
B009D0LBRO|4.0|What an amazing game! My only problem was that (on kindle fire) it lagged quite a bit in some places, making it a little harder. But definitely a must-buy!!
B007SXB498|5.0|I loved this book! I can't believe I had never read it before now. Although, that is probably good because the language and stuff makes it seem more adult oriented. I don't know that I would have enjoyed it at a younger age. It was captivating and I fell in love with the characters! Couldn't put it down! :-)
B007FEFLTO|5.0|So enjoyed this follow up to the Fall of Giants. Look forward to the final installment.  In fact I reread the Fall of Giants right before Winter of<br />the World was released so I would be reminded of all the important characters<br />and issues.
0525953728|3.0|The book was well written and I felt like I was there when the best of the best took out OBL.I wanted more details. I know that he could not give away military secerts but for someone who has never been in the armed services and could have never been a seal, I wanted to know more about the inside workings of goverment and the military. But no matter what, I am so glad this book was written because they took out OBL, Thank you guys for your service.
B00915G6MG|5.0|How could they have ended it like that OMG, it total shocked me, I could not believe it... it was VERY GOOOD... I have been watching it for all 10 SN and it has always surprised me how things end Up i cant wait till SN 11 come out on DVD so i can Watch it...
B007FG9LIE|3.0|This book had real potential. Reading the author's notes at the end, I realized he was going for a Twin Peaks vibe. Knowing that, after reading the book, I felt that the framework had been set up, but the characters were never fully fleshed out to to realize this quirky, surreal vision. Well written and fast paced, however.
B006A1NMXU|5.0|Admittedly, there is little I could ever find wrong with this show. The Leviathan in this season were a worthy enemy, and \\"Dick\\", king of the Leviathan was awesomely creepy. The loss of a key character was unexpected, but will freshen the dynamic of the show.
B007GCY8FS|4.0|This book did not disappoint. It was well written and I could not wait to get back to reading it! Reacher Creature almost scared me off from reading it, but after loving Every Other Jack Reacher novel  I didn't beleive that review.
B007SGM084|5.0|Oh my!! Read these books!!! Keeps you turning the pages till the very end!!  I can't wait for more from Fifty!!!!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Seriously erotic, without a doubt -- but the author had me spellbound from page #1. It's not just about the sex -- it truly is a deeply moving & profound LOVE STORY. I was not able to stop reading this book until it was FINISHED.  And before I even got 1/2 way through this book, I had already downloaded Book 2 and Book 3 of the series to my Kindle.  It's THAT GOOD!!!<br /><br />I cannot wait to see new material from this author.  Her writing style is so refreshing and \\"different\\".  Cannot say enough good things about this book.<br /><br />PS:  If your love life needs a little added \\"spice\\" -- this is definitely the way to get there!
B008U7ZPHS|5.0|This book is amazing. If you thought that The Lost Hero or The Son Of Neptune were any good, then you'll be blown away. Those books were just introductions to the rest of the series. Appetizers. But now that all the characters have been set, the villains introduced, let the fun begin!<br />This book is action packed. From the beginning to the horrible clifffhanger end. Once the Greeks arrive in Camp Jupiter, they get along with the romans for about two hours. Then, something happens and war is declared in between the romans, with Octavian in their lead, and the seven from the prophecy.<br />Percy, Annabeth, Leo, Hazel, Jason, Piper and Frank are fleeing from the roman army while trying to fulfill a whole new prophecy and save Nico di Angelo. Thankfully, they have good old Coach Hedge to chaperone them!<br />Rick Riordan uses the usual time~limited~trek~across~the~States formula, and it works. A god in particular helps along the way, and it's a little surprising.<br />Relationships in between the characters is one of the big aspects of the book. Some demigods get along surprisingly well, and some... Don't. Let's start first with Percy and Annabeth. Their reunion has been anticipated ever since the release of The Lost Hero, and can I just say, it does not disappoint! There are many cute scenes with both of them, and everybody just loves them. Leo and Frank, however, don't like each other much. There's the whole Sammy mystery (which is resolved in the book!), and Hazel and Leo get along a leeeeetle too well for Frank's comfort. I like how the Sammy thing is done, and love Hazel and Leo together! And as for whether Percy and Jason hate each other or not, you'll just have to read the book to find out!<br />But beware, the ending is a cliffhanger. Something terrible happens in the before last chapter, but there's one last one to resolve a couple of things, so you won't be left in total agony.<br />So here we go, one more year to wait. Good luck, and read this book!
B009329ZF2|3.0|I sat there watching this movie and was trying to stay awake. I wondered.how an alien race,that traveled hundreds of light years, could be defeated by a 70 year old battle ship!<br />Anyway... It had some action and it kept moving right up to climax.....The two words \\"THE END\\". Then I went to bed!
B009CPJHY4|2.0|My husband and I were very disappointed in this movie. It starts off well but as soon as the young man shows up, it all goes south. Apparently very few movie makers want to do a movie exclusively about older people (one example of how to do it well, The Bucket List) because here we have a silly side tale of romance and parental disapproval suddenly appearing. As if that weren't bad enough, it quickly begins to build romantic connections among the elders too, even a gay one (to make it up-to-date, I suppose). Then, to keep from offending anyone, they kill off the gay man so they don't have to take that storyline anywhere meaningful. It was like watching a bad episode of Three's Company with wrinkles. Honestly, it was a waste of well over two hours of our lives.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Great app!  Can be playyed online or offline.  You can play alone, or join someone online.  My whole family enjoys it.
B005RUUUAI|5.0|Loved the series so far! Now waiting for season 3! If you like zombies, then you will love these series
B006VFLIYK|5.0|The Innocent was an excellent book, but how can you go wrong with David Baldacci as the author? Recommend this book to anyone who wants a book that's an easy, fast-paced read with a lot of action and the perfect surprise ending -- definitely 5-stars!
B008Y1RTUG|4.0|I didn't know if I was going to like it cause of all the bad reviews but it turned out okay.
B007XKEY6Q|3.0|It's the non-updated version of what you get on your phone, but it's fine & it works & it's fun.
B007GCY8FS|2.0|Where was Reacher? Either Mr. Child is losing his enthusiasm for his likeable and intriguing hero, or he is being pushed to produce. It seemed he could have written this book in a day. The depth and pure entertainment of Reacher's character was lacking and the plot left a lot to be desired.
B003JTHWJQ|5.0|The book's unassailable logic viewed in the light of current radical Islamic terrorist events is profound.  The documentation of the wisdom of the need for complete separation of religion and state by our country's founding fathers is both inspirational and disheartening when viewed in today's election year context.  You will ask yourself after turning page after page, \\"how did we get here\\".<br /><br />Certainly not a lighthearted or casual read; have your dictionary close at hand and be prepared to open your mind as this book is as thought provoking as it is disturbing.  Don't assume that this book will arm you to reason with religious zealots, if anything it confirms the fact that you cannot use logic in the face of xenophobic hatred and tribalism.<br /><br />This is a fascinating exposé on the effect that religion has had on world events over the 2,000 years, a must read.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|I think this game is very fun its exciting you get to build a town you can go fishing and hunting you build houses and you have animals and crops
B008P1EWIM|3.0|I use this weather app to check my area, the weather in the areas that family live in so when we travel we'll know what type of clothing the take.  Its good but I wish it gave more info.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|I love this book. Please Ken F. let the 3. be as interesting as this one. I have been crying, laughing and most of all felt the feelings of the characters in the book. I don't like it when a good book is at the end. Most of all I repeat history classes in a very interesting way. i hope my children will read this book in a couple of years. Thank You
B008XG1X18|4.0|I liked it but you can't customize your boards on the individual app, you have to go to the online version. but other than that its pretty awesome.
B0091REZMW|5.0|it is addictive trying to find all of the items listed within the time limit! I really enjoy this game!
B0055V6EZE|4.0|I sampled each song before ordering & enjoyed every one. He also has a good voice! This was a bday gift for my brother. He hasn't played it yet. He'll be pleasantly surprised when he does. If he doesn't want it; I'll gladly take it!
0525953728|5.0|Wonderful Book. Really catches me on how its just not one mission he talks about but most of the missions he was in.
1933492279|5.0|Great book, Daniel Simons create a new world (literaly)in the Design industry with this book worth every penny![[ASIN:1933492279 Cosmic Motors: Spaceships, Cars and Pilots of Another Galaxy (English and German Edition)]]
B007GCY8FS|2.0|Sadly, AGAIN I bought the Lee Child's novel.  My love for Jack Reacher has no bounds, however, once again I was disappointed.<br /><br />The novel starts with a very promising and interesting story line, however this did not last long.  Even Jack seems to have changed, and that was what I loved Jack Reacher for, he stuck to his truths and although he came across as someone who didnt care, we the fans knew what a good guy he was.  I didn't feel this in the Wanted Man. Even the other characters were weak.  Really, the agent who takes her child everywhere, regardless, did she not worry in case something happend to her, I never felt her love for her child.<br /><br />The last couple of chapters, what a waste of time, I have to admit, I even just glanced over some chapters.  Really even Jack Reacher, MY Jack Reacher, couldnt not do all that on his own.<br /><br />I think that its time for Lee Child to say goodbye to Jack Reacher, and maybe think of a new hero, hopefully this will spark off some intersing ideas for him as a writer and for me as a reader.<br /><br />Sadly the truth of the matter is that, by the time Lee Child, Jack Reacher's new novel is out, I will buy it because I live in hope.<br /><br />However this does not make Lee Childs, the great writer that he was, It just makes me a sucker for Jack Reacher.
1416955070|5.0|I was really suprised on how well this book flowed. I gave me just enough information to keep me wanting more, but it wasn't totaly empty to where I didn't know what is going on. Awesome twist that I didn't expect. Have to say it was a really great book. Have to read the others now.
B007GCY8FS|5.0|Another great Jack Reacher novel.  Action from the beginning, mystery in the middle, and exciting combat action in the end.  Don't miss this one if you are a Reacher fan.
0307990850|5.0|I have read all of the Jack Reacher novels, and they were all great reads.  But this one was really difficult to put down once you pick it up.  It is full of twists and turns, bungling by the FBI, CIA and Homeland Security and lots of action.  Reacher, coming off of a physically wounding experience in the last book hitchhikes directly into the line of fire in Wanted Man. Double deep FBI undercovers struggle with their own organizational shortcomings while Reacher muddles through and shows his colors to the end of the line, while good guys and bad guys fall all around him.<br /><br />If you have never read Lee Childs before, definitely buy this book, but go back through the entire 17 Reacher novels and see what you missed. I would read the first three starting with Killing Floor in order. I can't wait until the next one comes out in 2013.  Bon appetit!
B005HEXQN2|5.0|Perhaps you have to watch the entire series, but in the end, you are rewarded with the best hour and a half on television.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I love that I can now use Pinterest on my kindle.  I can now be on pinterest anywhere I go.
B007GCY8FS|5.0|This is one of the better Reacher books that I have read.  Excellent story line that keeps the reader engaged.  A must read for Reacher fans.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|I love this game its a little hard to collect coins to unlock new games though but when they get unlocked its so much. fun..
B008MG1E4A|4.0|The book contained much information about SEAL training, some of it was over my head, but they do an amazing training routine and are prepared for any assignment.  Of course, the highlight of the book was the Osama bin Laden raid and the difference in the writer's account and what came out in the news.  I was disappointed that the doctor that was reported to have gathered intelligence for the raid was not mentioned, perhaps he did not exist.<br />  In no way did I feel that any intelligence was given that would be harmful to our country or to any further operations.  My admiration for the SEAL's was and always has been a grateful appreciation for their sacrifice, I would have enjoyed a few more personal details about the author's life, but understand his reason for keeping it secret.<br />  Overall, the book was more like a documentary but it was worth the reading.
B001A3GSJ8|4.0|Their best work, to date! This album works from start to finish. Well worth the $ to add this to my personal collection.
B009LZDGSI|5.0|Just when you thought S.H. had been done to perfection, just when you thought his character thoroughly explored and like so many stories before you thought the tale was done...comes Elementary. It's Fantastic, brilliant. addictive and fully worth five stars.
B005LLSNNE|4.0|I find the series fast paced. They have taken a page from the British shows, if it time for a character to die or leave the show, it doesn't matter if it is in the middle of the season, it is time for them to go. Each episode of the show does end so that the viewer is counting down to when the next episode will be viewed.
B007ZXK08C|4.0|This is a well written thriller about the marriage of a seriously crazy girl and her unsuspecting husband. The plot has plenty of twists and the suspense is maintained throughout. It will keep you up at night reading and offers some good insights into personality. It is better than most thrillers and offers a few surprises. Definitely worth reading.
B0098VYKSA|3.0|I was expecting this movie to be a lot better. When I saw the previews it looked sick. It was alright though.
B003TNQEF0|5.0|Very good movie. Great plot, well executed. Classic Stephen King. If you like sci fi you will really like this movie.
030758836X|5.0|Gone Girl by Gillian Flynn is the story of a marriage gone wrong. Both Nick and Amy have recently lost their jobs and moved from New York City to North Carthage, Missouri, in order to care for Nick's dying mother. As the novel opens, Nick and Amy are supposed to be celebrating their fifth wedding anniversary. Instead Amy has disappeared under suspicious circumstances and all the evidence makes Nick looks guilty. As the media attention increases on Nick, he pleads for his wife to come home, but citizens of his home town as well as the country are sure Nick is guilty of foul play in Amy's disappearance.<br /><br />Chapter's alternate between Nick and Amy. Nick's chapters follow a current time line and the ongoing criminal investigation. In the first section Amy's chapters start out as diary entries that begin back before they were married and continue up to her disappearance.<br /><br />In this psychological thriller, the writing is stunning, clever, subtle, witty, and chillingly suspenseful. Just when I thought I had things figured out, there was a twist... and another... and another. The plot is incredibly layered and the truth is slowly revealed. The characters are all well developed, multidimensional and complex individuals with faults and strengths, just like real people. Just when you know you love or hate a character, Flynn will add yet another dimension to them and change your preconceived ideas of what is going on. This is story-telling at it's finest.<br /><br />I read Gone Girl  in a day not because it was a quick read, but because it is that good. Between the exceptional writing and the phenomenal plot Girl Gone is sure to make my top ten reads of 2012. Read it. And, if you haven't done so already, read Gillian Flynn's earlier novels: Dark Places and Sharp Objects.<br /><br />Very Highly Recommended - one of the best
B007GCY8FS|3.0|\\"Wanted Man\\", the latest installment by Lee Child was not quite up to his usual standards. The story was slower paced than the typical Reacher, with long stretches of driving through the midwest.  Child gives us some fascinating tidbits of the Iowa highway system and the possible pitfalls of making a wrong turn into vast nothingness, but it's hard to get too excited about geography. He also stretches credibility when Reacher communicates with a hostage through a bizarre blinking game. Come on, not even Reacher could do that. However, Child builds towards a strong ending, almost making up for plodding along through the middle part of the story. Vintage Reacher can be found in plots like \\"Echo Burning\\" where the villains are more vile and heroine more nuanced. We like to have the story set up where Reacher can kick butt with abandon. In \\"Wanted Man\\", you miss the old Reacher, and maybe it's because Reacher himself is getting old. Nevertheless, a less than stellar Reacher escapade is far better than almost anything else in the genre. We are somewhat shocked if anything we read by this author is less than excellent.
B007MB5OCE|5.0|I loved this book. Allan Karlsson, a man of humble origins, let his love of vodka and his philosophy of \\"what will be will be\\" lure him from one unlikely adventure to another in a life that brings to mind Forrest Gump. He saved the life of General Franco, drank tequila with President Truman, helped invent the atomic bomb, spied for the CIA, and hobnobbed with Churchill, MaoTse Tung, and Stalin.  Even at 100 years old he was able to escape from the old folks home, steal a suitcase full of money and go on the lam with a wonderfully eccentric group of strangers who soon became a delightfully dysfunctional family. Allan's romp through history definitely should not be missed.
B004X6PRO6|2.0|Maybe I just wasn't in the mood for this book, but I gave up about 1/3 of the way in.  I found it totally unreadable and not very interesting.
B000NY12CI|5.0|Well written book by and about a living woman.  Tells us things we should know about Islam, as lived by the author.
B008XG1X18|3.0|Works well most of the time. It does have some issues with forced closings and sometimes just not loading correctly.
B0098VYCCE|1.0|This movie was a total let down. Snow White was not a strong enough character, I found myself sympathizing with the queen.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Never a dull moment in this one. Loved every second. Couldn't put it down for until I was done.  Exciting twisted read! Highly recommend.
B0090EHVMC|5.0|This movie was so cute - adult laugh-out-loud cute in a couple of places. It also has great objects lessons for kids, in a way they can understand. Loved it. And delivery time was excellent!
B005PV81MS|5.0|Just got finished watching this and I'm really impressed.  I picked it up at the library (yeah, the library!) because hey, Nick Frost.<br />Really a ridiculously good alien invasion movie, kept you jumping and pumped up all the way through.  I kept scaring my dog going \\"eeeek!\\" and grabbing him when the aliens popped out.  Some very funny bits, too bad this didn't see wider release, but I think it'll gain cult status in the US like Shaun of the Dead did.<br />Very satisfying, I'd highly recommend.
1439102430|3.0|If you are a fan of the FOX television series \\"Bones\\" and you pick up one of Kathy Reichs' Temperance Brennan novels you will be in for a rude awakening.  To begin, with the exception of Temperance hardly any of the characters from the TV series are featured in the novels and her on-air love interest --- Booth --- is a composite of two characters in the novels (Andrew Ryan and Ollie Hasty).<br /><br />The latest Brennan novel, BONES ARE FOREVER, is the fifteenth in this successful series that provided inspiration for the hit show. Even though this novel begins with a forensic mystery it soon takes a sharp twist and the end result is a story unlike all those prior in this series.<br />A woman using the name Amy Roberts checks into a Montreal hospital with a case of uncontrolled bleeding and promptly disappears.  When Temperance Brennan and her crime-fighting partner, Detective Andrew Ryan are dispatched to follow the case they turn up a truly grisly find.  Upon arrival at Mr. Roberts' address they find the badly decomposed bodies of three infants and Roberts is nowhere to be found.<br /><br />Making matters more complicated is that no one knows for sure who the real Amy Roberts is.  Her landlord has her listed as Alma Rogers and a recent boyfriend swears she is Alva Rodriguez.  The trail soon stretches across Canada to Edmonton and forces Tempe and Ryan to call on the resources of Royal Canadian Mounted Police Sergeant Ollie Hasty.  This introduction also makes for interesting reading as Ollie and Temperance have a brief fling in their past and this causes obvious tension with the newly formed trio.<br /><br />As the hunt into the mysterious Ms. Roberts past gets deeper the novel takes its' sharp turn.  BONES ARE FOREVER moves far away from a standard forensic mystery and instead digs deep into the sordid underworld of Edmonton and the Northwest territories.  Specifically, an illegal diamond-smuggling and mining ring appears to be at the bottom of the Amy Roberts mystery and places Temperance and company in the cross-hairs of some highly dangerous individuals.<br />As opposed to other Brennan novels which jump between locations, particularly Canada and North Carolina, BONES ARE FOREVER stays situated in Canada and provides some eye-opening peeks into what is assumed to be a peaceful and tranquil country.  Kathy Reichs herself indicates that it was her personal role in some child homicide cases that created the impetus for this novel.  She also became quite interested in diamond-mining controversy in certain parts of Canada and cleverly combined the two story-lines into one plot.<br /><br />I was somewhat disappointed at how easily the `Amy Roberts' story-line is wrapped up and quickly supplanted by the diamond-mining plotline but also recognize that to keep a long-running series going you need to step out of character occasionally and take chances.  While not a traditional `bones' story, BONES ARE FOREVER raises some clear moral issues that Kathy Reichs obviously feels strongly about and their impacts resonate through all her characters.<br /><br />Reviewed by Ray Palen for New Mystery Reader
B008MG1E4A|4.0|Very entertaining, get you right in the middle of a seal team. I felt like I was one of the boys. I felt like I was in the room when they got Bin Laden. I would have liked a few drawings an layout of the compound to further pull me in. But the disscription was very good. Very satisfied with the read.
B0076NKNLA|3.0|Michelle Williams looked and acted the part of Marilyn very well. She became Marilyn Monroe! When she was on the screen, she lit it up.  That is the only reason that this film was rated 3 stars - I have no idea who thought this story was worthy of a movie and then to get Academy Award recognition??  It seemed boring and dumb to us. The other actors were not engaging or interesting, which is a shame, and they made the story draaaaaaag.  At the end, we asked - what was the point? Other than to showcase how MW can transform herself, we have no clue. Maybe it was over our heads but we were disappointed.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|Thank you for such a wonderful account of what happened on the mission and recognition all those who have sacrificed so much so that we can read this book in safety. I am a volunteer firefighter and this book has rejuvenated my commitment to my craft and my brothers. Heroism lies in the everyday decisions we make at home and abroad. Read this book!
B004HD61KE|4.0|This is another solid adventure novel from the pen of James Rollins.  If you are looking for a good read, well-paced action story, then you cannot go wrong with The Devil Colony.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|This is the second book in a series of three by Ken Follet.  The first, Fall of Giants, took us from about 1919 (If I remember correctly) to 1930.  This one, Winter of the World, picks up where the first ended and covers the period to 1950.  Involving four families, whose lives become intertwined in one way or another, - English,  American, German and Russian, the book covers all major evens of the period from The Spanish civil war, through the rise of Nazi Germany,  major events of World War II and beyond.  This is REALLY giving a brief review of the story.<br /><br />Follet has done his research as always. The book is fascinating and you get caught up in the lives of the people and events.  I even learned a couple of facts about WW II that I didn't know.<br /><br />If you are a Follet fan, don;t miss it. And if you aren't, give the series a try - but start with Fall of Giants.
B005LAIIQC|4.0|This film is in the perfect continuity of the first three in the series by its title which has the same structure as the first three. But I am disappointed in a way.<br /><br />The action is probably perfect though it is only an escape and not a chase to impose a positive end, only to get away from those who are chasing you. That's weak. For sure we have Manilla and the cars, the motorbikes, the hunt on the roofs and even a long hike in Alaska. I must say that the wolves are superb animals and that it is a shame so many are killed. Though a drone and a missile for one wolf seems slightly expensive.<br /><br />The plot is simple but unexplained at all. The secret security services of the USA have set up several programs to fight against terrorism, each one of them totally entangled into the others but with one probably slightly more central than the others. A hostile foreign agency that is not identified is trying to get this program and this program has a fair chance to get out because the main people who devised it are not under control. So the decision is taken to destroy the program and to get rid of all those who have been in touch with it, no matter how little.<br /><br />The worst part is that even the uniformed generals (note the only one that is brought up is black: no allusion to the president that we all know to be powerless) do not know about the situation and it is a handful of bureaucrats of these security agencies that have no public front who take decisions and implement the decisions they take under absolutely no control from whoever you may imagine. The President is not even mentioned. In other words they are, these bureaucrats a state in the sate. The USA have reinvented ,the KGB, the STASI, and those had a public front, even the SS was not completely invisible.<br /><br />Unluckily this theme has already been explored vastly in the genre over the last fifty years.<br /><br />It goes slightly further when we learn that this program aimed at producing super human people who did not feel pain, who had an IQ over 200 and who were as strong as aliens. These prototypes were nine and are still six and they have to be eliminated along with all the people who worked on this program. These prototypes were produced by some genetic manipulation of viruses or retroviruses to change the human genome of the individuals who are infected with these genetically modified viruses.

B000JMKTLO|5.0|Gillian Flynn writes about the darkness within herself and others. Breathtakingly honest look inside the selves of the characters, deep understanding of inner motives and a cathartic journey of discovery takes our main character on a journey of self discovery while she unravels a mystery painfully close to her past. Gillian Flynn is the writer to bring awakening to the the reader and a greater understanding of ourselves and others.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I highly recommend this collection! You will be happy you have have the next book to go to, I was unable to wait to start the next book! The author is very talented, able to stir your heart strings as well as keeping you guessing! The series is the work of a true science fiction writer! Look for him to be the next Neil Stephenson! I've since gobbled up everything he has written and been pleased! Keep up the writing, and I'll keep up the reading! Great work!
B0074D3CAQ|5.0|An unlikely pilgrimage by an unlikely man moved by a note he received. Excellent writing and the unraveling of family secrets that strain and rip apart a family. Adventure, awakening, atonement, forgiveness, embracing one's life as it is. Harol reaches out and transforms himself and truly multitudes by his simple act of devotion and committment.<br />Wonderful book and a trip worth the walk!
B005ZCXPP0|5.0|This is a great movie for all the whole family. Lots of action. Great characters even the smaller roles. This movie has its heart in the right place. Good values promoted. And very patriotic at time we really need it. Follow up Avengers also very good. Maybe better as Hydra is kind of scary for the younger ones.
0345529057|4.0|I loved this series. Brilliant characters that come alive - wonderful writing that details the era, environment and garb of the day. Interesting drama about a divided world; not so unlike the world we live in; except for the occassional rumor of dragons. Ancient religions, thoughts, clans and their alliances, battles, bloodshed and victory. These book truly offer the reader a glimpse of an era gone by and a vivid look at the life, struggles, victories ad losses of each character.  LOVE, LOVE, LOVE these books!
B005H9B2CE|4.0|When I first saw this movie I thought it was kind of silly. OK but didn't enthrall me. Funny thing after I watched the Avengers I went back and watched this movie and liked it more. If nothing else this guy has a chest that goes on for days.
0062183591|5.0|Whether Dan Ariely knows it or not, he describes dishonesty in the financial adviser community to the letter. A little cheating when dealing with the public is the norm for Wall Street, and it doesn't matter how an adviser is paid (hourly fees, commissions or as a percentage of assets). Everyone who invests through an adviser should read this book.
B005OT2YVA|4.0|I loved the first two movies so I had high hopes for this one. The good news: There is a lot of movie here. It's worth the extra money for big screen, 3D Blu Ray etc. But it is different in tone to the first two. I could watch the others with my grandson. I know that's not a deal breaker for most people but it's something I enjoy. This movie had human suffering. Michael Bay usually avoids that which is what makes his the popcorn type of movie. But that's not the reason I subtracted one star. The reason is that the scrawny girl is really annoying. Her lipstick is too pink and it's distracting. That's just my personal opinion. Otherwise I highly recommend it.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|I found this to be a pretty fun game to pass time. better than farmville and all those other ones like it
B004SJ3AXI|5.0|I really enjoy this game very much.  I'm addicted!!!  It is very fun to play and I like the different scenes as well.
B004LWZWGK|1.0|After not buying movies for a number of years, as I just didn't believe what I was receiving in the packages was worth the price, I started getting back into it recently when they started creating packages including DVDs, Blue Ray and Digital Downloads.  I found it completely worth the extra price as it provided multiple ways of watching the movie I bought, and I could download movies to my IPad.  I travel frequently for work, and watching movies on my IPad while on flights and overseas in third world countries has saved my sanity.  With the move towards UltraViolet, I will no longer be buying any movies that don't include a real digital download.  UltraViolet won't allow me to watch movies while on my flights or overseas.  It is completely worthless.  The idea of UltraViolet was to cut down on piracy, but I think it's steering  more people to it.  Film studios need to quit punishing individuals like me who are actually willing to provide money for good packages.  I swear, these days it really is easier just to jump on the pirating bandwagon than to legitimately buy something.
B008G12ERC|3.0|I've been a Muse fan for nearly a decade now. I've liked all of their previous albums, and I like how they experiment, weaving in all sorts of genres and styles and embossing them with a giant bombastic MUSE stamp of musicality. Their yearly reinvention is part of the fun! However, the songs on this album seem safe, derivative, and just a little bit tired, as if Matt Bellamy needs a nice long nap.<br /><br />This is not an album, just a collection of songs. There's no cohesive thread running through the mix -- the CD starts strong and gradually winnows away into forgettable songs. Occasional sparks of genius are overshadowed by simple, safe arrangements, or weaker repetitions of stuff they've already done better on old albums.<br /><br />The inclusion of their Olympic song (\\"Survival\\") seems completely out of place with the rest of the album. The Wolstenholme songs are good enough, but they're not MUSE at all (maybe a solo album would have been better?). \\"Save Me\\" sounds like Muse trying to be Coldplay, and \\"Liquid State\\" sounds like Finger Eleven trying to be Muse. The CD ends with another mini-symphony (\\"2nd Law\\"), and it's more soundtrack than rock song. I didn't mind the dubstep bits but it felt over the top and not in a good \\"Knights of Cydonia\\" way (more like a \\"Ross Gellar plays the keyboards\\" way).<br /><br />I'm disappointed that this album was just good and not great. As \\"MUSE's next big album\\" it's a meandering mess. Had it been advertised as a collection of B-sides instead, it wouldn't be half bad. If you're a diehard fan, you've probably already bought this album. If you just want a couple great tunes to blast in the car, try a couple of the MP3s instead.
B007K3JCAE|1.0|I loved this movie and was really looking forward to buying it when it was released on DVD/Blue Ray/Digital Copy, like the first one.  When I saw that it was only being released with the UltraViolet format I decided to give it a pass.  I only buy movies that come as a package with the digital copy, due to constant travel.  UltraViolet is not a true digital download.  What a waste.  It's unfortunate that in the movie studio's zeal to fight piracy they are making pushing more customers to it.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|This is a great, easy read. The plot is better in the second book, but all three will keep your attention. Enjoyable.
B004PLT3TY|5.0|My five year old grandson loves the movie Sky High and believes he too has super powers.  His very special power is that he is speedy fast and zooms around the house and outside.
B005COO1X6|5.0|Loved this for a quick SK fix on a slow Saturday afternoon.     I would highly recommend this to any SK lover or anyone who wants a taste of King.
B007GCY8FS|5.0|I have read all of Child's Reacher books and this one is just a great as all of the other ones.
0345803493|5.0|This book is awesome!! I couldn't put it down. I usually am not a reader. But when I read the trilogy .. It was truly a pleasure.. And I'm sure almost every woman wants a Christian Grey.
B008MG1E4A|4.0|The book is an easy read. Very well written and hard to put down. I do all my reading in bed at night, and found myself reading into the wee hours of the morning!!
B0083GCK5G|5.0|Beach Boys not only take you back but show the way forward. Great harmonies, modern tunes and a great uplift in this \\"modern crazy world\\". It just shows that Music will transfer from one generation to another. A GREAT ALBUM
B0050DIWFC|5.0|This is a fascinating story that hold your interest throughout. You never see the ending coming. Be prepared for a great read.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|my kids love it and its free good for all ages! Plays very well on the kindle fire and doesn't seem to have any glitches.
B008BM9L72|1.0|I found the actual books very disappointing  after all the hype, the writing was repetitive and  boring.  I struggled to read the first book, and in the end just gave up, although my three daughters loved the books.
B000ICXQHE|5.0|EXCELLENT MOVIE,WATCHED IT TWICE AND LIKED THE INTRODUCTORY MUSIC,JUST NEED TO KNOW WHO THE ARTISTS ARE AND WHAT COUNTRY?<br /><br />DENZEL`S ALWAYS A VERY GOOD PERFORMING ACTOR!!!
B007VUA7VO|3.0|Sometimes I think this App. can be a waste of space. Sorry.  I mean-its no horrible.  It does tell you how much your kindle is charged but that's about it.  The tool bar doesn't.  So its a plus.  Overall I recommend to get it.  ;)
B007MB5OCE|5.0|Amazing story, full of witty and serious encounters, reflecting the history of the last century from a completely different angle.
B000025Y9I|5.0|Before I heard the 'Road To Hell' the only Chris Rea song I liked was 'Fool (If You Think It's Over)', which I jump rope to. Then I heard 'The Road To Hell' and the only way to get it was to buy the CD, which I did. All I can say is now I'm going to check out 'Blue Cafe' and everything else I can find by Chris Rea because this is great. I'm sure other reviewers have covered it song by song, etc. I'm just looking forward to jumping to nearly every song on the CD except maybe 'The Road To Hell Part I', which is the setup for Part II, which kicks ass, and I don't care for 'Tell Me There's A Heaven' - I know it's meaningful, but way too sentimental and syrupy for my taste - if you've heard any Harry Chapin songs aside from \\"Cat's in the Cradle\\" then you have the idea. Otherwise it's all good even when it's not excellent, but it's nearly all excellent.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|it is so fun I play it all the time and you can get points really easy to buy the games that is why I like it
B007GCY8FS|3.0|Found not as exciting as previous books. Reacher less action oriented and more wait and see. Plot was O.K. but not as challenging as in earlier books. But I still enjoyed it more than many others I have read.
B006ZAZ31U|5.0|This man was a true hero. The story of his life had me laughing, crying, cheering and wishing I could have had the privilege of meeting him. Praise God for Adam Brown and his family!  Thank you Brown family for sharing this wonderful story.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|After President Obama came on my television and advised the nation that OBL had been killed, I looked at my husband and said, \\"I want to read the book from man who was involved in that. What goes through your mind? Are you scared, nervous, calm? I want to know exactly what it was like to be inside the mind of one of the men who were involved in making history.\\" Well, the author does exactly that. He takes you into his mind and shows you glimpses of life as a Seal, the mentality of a Seal and into the mission at hand as it unfolds for him. He makes it clear that he is no Obama fan but you can feel the appreciation for his job, fellow Seals, and his country. There were moments that gave me goose bumps, moments that made me smile and moments that almost brought a tear. I couldn't stop reading to the very last page. I admire his strength, courage and bravery and would recommend this book to everyone. Regardless of the backlash due to the releasing of this book, he is a hero in mine.
B007TMON8M|2.0|Its fun at first..until it gets way too difficult and makes u angry. I don't enjoy it! Also it is addicting so u cant stop playing it which makes it even worse Bc than it makes u evenn more mad when u cant do it!!!!grrrr
B0035JRVR8|5.0|Audrey Hepburn was never lovelier, a great performance by Gregory Peck.  Great chemistry, great scenery and a very enchanting story.
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|this is a great game...I recommend it. graphics are clean an impressive. I liked it much more than the higher priced hidden objects games.
B007FEFLTO|3.0|Good continuation of the first part of the series, but not as good as the first. The book is very well written and a must if you read \\"the fall of the giants\\" Hope there is a third and final to the story.  Very long but but I assure you you will not get bored!
B003VANOFY|1.0|I did a bit of research on Wireless gaming headsets before I purchased these. Quite a few of the negative reviews I read on these mentioned the same thing, that the sound would cut out frequently. But I decided to give them a shot because I've had good experiences with Logitech Products previously. The short and sweet of it is that, while the functions and hardware of the product are very nice, it means absolutely bubbkis when they cut out every five to ten minutes. I'm not saying that you should'nt purchase these headphones, because they are very nice, and the funcionality is fantastic, but be prepared to send them back, if you start having the cutout problem.<br /><br />Update:<br />Under no circumstances should you get a replacement for a \\"hardware\\" fault. A new set of G930's will not fix this issue. If you have this problem, take your refund and purchase a different set of headphones. Logitech has not, as of 3/28/2014, fixed the problem, nor are they responding to customer feedback on the issue.<br /><br />I have downgraded my review to 1 star due to the lack of response on Logitech's part to a growing number of customers with this problem.
B00005J6T1|5.0|This has been one of my favorite albums since I was a kid.  The sound is less poppy and more dance-oriented than Like a Virgin.  It contains the earliest Madonna classics like Lucky Star, Borderline, Burning Up, Everybody (her first single), and of course, Holiday.  Holiday is my favorite Madonna song, and this full-length original is my favorite version.  The rest of the album is good, too.  Think of Me is a cool song, and I Know It is fun-I like the saxophone in both of them.  Physical Attraction is the song I like least, but it's not bad.  The best part is the music when she sings \\"maybe we were meant to be together, even though we never met before, we got to move before the sun is rising, and you'll be walking slowly out the door\\".  That has always been the most memorable part of the song to me.<br /><br />The extended versions of Lucky Star and Burning Up are good.  Too bad they didn't include more bonus tracks.  The album was originally supposed to include the song Ain't No Big Deal.  Apparently it was given to another artist before Madonna was to release it, and was replaced with Holiday, which worked out really, really well.  But I think the song fits in perfectly with the rest of the tracks, and would've been a nice addition as a bonus track.  Oh, well.  It's still a good release.
B007JM4CWY|5.0|this game is the perfect way to pass some time.  if you enjoy games like suduku, you will love this.  once you get the hang of the games strategies, its hard to put down.  my only knock on the game is the repetitive puzzles, but that doesn't gender the fun.
B007GCY8FS|3.0|I have read all of the Reacher books. Approximately 50% is redundent thoughts from the main character from other books. However, generally a good read.
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|You don't want to put it down lots of fun fun fun fun fun fun fun fun fun fun fun
B001ANSSDC|5.0|Very good read. Read it on one day, couldn't put it down.The main character was so simple he was complex.
B007TMON8M|2.0|The game was fun.. mentally challenging and interesting... For about thirty minutes.<br />I got bored real quick and deleted it.
B007I2BZIE|5.0|Clockwork Angels is one of the best albums by Rush. They get back to their roots musically. More drive, less keyboards!  This album is a must have for early and all Rush fans.
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|Nice story  and keeps your attention... and thank goodness it has a zoom feature! Looking forward to the next one!
B008XG1X18|5.0|This is a great application. There are times when it closes but I love ease of use. Must download this app.
B008133MDK|5.0|The production values for a \\"mere TV show\\" are incredibly high, in fact these are movies. I ended up watching the entire season over a weekend.
B008MEM24S|5.0|i really enjoyed where's my water, so i tried this game out.  it was just as fun but with perry!! full version is great!
B001AQO3Z6|5.0|After a long wait, the Criterion Collection will release the complete Qatsi Trilogy on Blu-ray on December 11th, 2012. It has been remastered and digitally scanned, includes tons of additional features. Hoarray !<br /><br />[[ASIN:B009D004MC The Qatsi Trilogy (Criterion Collection) [Blu-ray]]]
B0094U0RJQ|3.0|2 of the tracks are exceptional, well worth the purchase price, the rest are what we've come to expect from Bob:  Thought-Provoking & Unique. Hope this isn't his final effort, he's still a true original, mercurial as ever.
B000FA5STS|5.0|Ths is an exciting book from cover to cover.  Lots of fascinating intrigue.<br />Characters are well defined.  Lots of action, and very little blood & Gore
B006LSZECO|5.0|Wasn't expecting that to happen! I finished it in one day because I just had to know what happened! I have recommended this book to all my friends!
B003O86FMW|5.0|Best series ever! i love this book. surprise ending too. everything you could want in a book. i couldn't stop reading
0812416503|5.0|I love almost all of Du Maurier's work, but this is my absolute favorite.  Her writing is so beautiful, vivid, and macabre... I felt like I was the \\"new\\" Mrs. de Winter inside Manderley.  I was thinking her thoughts, feeling her insecurity, dying inside with each awkwardly intense situation.  The twists and turns in the novel will keep you up at night.  The Hitchcock film does not do this novel justice.  Rebecca will haunt you... in a good way... in the best way.  It is EXQUISITE.
B007TMON8M|5.0|I am not a game player, per se, but this is not really a game.  It instantly shows you the results of your structural design and allows you to make changes one piece at a time.  It is a great learning experience and is fun at the same time.  I think it is a good use of spare time.
B0099G4Y26|5.0|P!nk's new album, The Truth About Love, is an amazing album. It's not the typical happy/unhappy love album, it describes the many different shades that love can have. With this album you can dance, you can cry and you can definitely have a great time.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|Great read and being a vet myself found a real connection with them and their mission. Could not put it down . A big thank you for their service and for MISSION COMPLETED!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Could hardly put it down. Up til 2-3 am reading. Had to get other 2 right away! The sex just added to the storyline. Highly recommend.
B004SOR4H6|5.0|Bueno espero que el espanol sea suficiente,que puedo decir sobre este producto .Es muy protector para el equipo y muy facil de manejar.
B004FGMDOQ|4.0|This book was a quick read, but it was really neat. The pictures gave credit to the storyline, and helped to make it seem more like it was real (and maybe it was!)
B006G3MZRQ|5.0|This was a powerful movie. Great story of father-son relationships and fighting for your family. Wonderful movie. I would recommend this to friends, family, anyone. Very good story, action, and drama.
B003TSEEDY|4.0|When I first heard about the movie I thought that might be a renter. Then I started reading interviews from the cast and it started to sound really good so I decided to read the book. Wow. Where was this book when I was in high school? I was really able to relate to Charlie on different levels. The questions he asks are some of the same questions I asked, difference was he had many friends. The only thing I would like to have seen explored more was the relationship between Charlie and Patrick. Although it was touched a little when Patrick was going through \\" tough\\" times with his hotly boyfriend I would like to have seen more, although the kiss scene in the car was really hot.<br /><br />Anyway my review probably doesn't help much but this really was a great book. I think it should be a mandatory read in high school as it is more relatable then the boring books kids are forced to read.  Young, old I think everyone can see themselves in one of the characters.
B003TH41H4|5.0|love the books, as well as the series! watch it to enter the mystical and magical land of richard and khalan. enough said.
B004HD61KE|5.0|James Rollins keeps it going with his Sigma novels. Every chapter is a page turner. There hasn't been a book on his sigma characters that I have not stayed up until 3 am to finish it!
B008HK3XU4|2.0|The design is not worth the price, unless you have a specific reason for the stand feature, which is not as useful as it looks. If your purpose is to protect the kindle, there are better, less expensive and more useful cases available.
B000FBFN1U|5.0|I thought this series would begin to lag by the third book but Martin continues to deliver a solid story. By this time you are comfortable knowing when you pick up the book you will drop into a world you are familiar with and don't have to feel rushed to read to the end. You can relax and enjoy a long satisfying read.
B00846REIS|1.0|This book was a waste of time after \\"Fifty Shades of Gray\\". It took the same theme changed names and places and condensed into one book. This book lacked the depth and any real story. This book ended very flat.
B004Q7CIFI|5.0|Everything you would expect from king with some history throw in.  Couldn't put it down. I hope he will write more like it.
B008RV5K5E|5.0|This is the best Batman animated movie I have ever watched!  There are some good ones out there, but this one definitely set the bar high for future Batman animated features.  If you're a Batman fan, you won't be disappointed.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|I have no idea why I like this game so much but I do.  It's addictive and cathartic and fun for some reason.
0307744434|4.0|If you like fantasy books, you will love this one.  I don't usually like this type of book, but my book club picked it to read and it was a real \\"page turner\\".
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Reading the 2nd book of this trilogy. Loved the first book and enjoying the 2nd. I would highly recommend this trilogy of books.
B0098VXBIA|5.0|This movie was unexpectedly very good. It had. A surprising amount of heartfelt moments and plot twists I didn't see coming. The \\"Dads\\" group was by far the comic relief. It also showed all aspects of pregnancy including the negative. I never expected to rate this 5 stars, but it was earned.
