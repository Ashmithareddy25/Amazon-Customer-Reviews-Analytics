B0000A1RJI|5.0|This CD was phenominal....it was like I was back in the theater for the who knows what time watching the film again.  Yes, yes, Orlando Bloom is hot, Johnny Depp is awesome, and Keira Knightley kicks butt in this film...those are all givens, but Klaus Badelt does an amazing job (this IS a review of the CD).  The music was great and totally captured the mood of the film.  I cannot possibly think about the film without the wondeful score.  Buy this CD!
B000127LW2|4.0|Let's face it.  Everybody has their favorite Star Trek Captain, and Series from the Franchise. I prefer DS9; you might prefer NTG, Voyager, or Enterprise. But the fact remains, that Paramount is hitting us with these whopping $100 price tags for these DVDs because they know that's what the market will permit.  If you want to drive down the price, don't buy it on the first day, first week, or first month.  Let them know that enough  is enough.  Unlike other TV DVD Box Sets (Buffy, \\"24\\", etc.), Star Trek fans tend to be compulsive junkies willing to do anything (including pay $100+ a pop) to get their fix.  The rest of us regular types who enjoy the show (in reasonable doses) must pay the price for the compulsive nature of our fellow Trek fans. That said, Voyager was cool.  Not my favorite, but a solid show with interesting characters.  Seven of Nine was really overrated, but she doesn't even join the cast until Season 4.
B00005K3OT|5.0|Feast your senses on chocolate, music and the delicious Johnny Depp.  <br />It is foolhardy to watch this movie without chocolate at the ready.  I predict you will last about 45 seconds after the first chocolate appears before you start ripping off the candy bar wrapper.  (May I suggest a pound of See's as a wise pre-movie purchase?)<br />The music is a great variety, from kick-up-your-heels to the sweet melody you hear in the wind.  I highly recommend the soundtrack for whatever mood you can think of.  <br />Then, of course, there's Johnny Depp, that hotty of hotties, that dashing, debonair pirate-like sweetie.  His character is just as appealing as the man himself; witty, sweet and adorably hot!<br />The tale of a traveling mother-daughter duo shunned by the straightlaced inhabitants of a mid-20th-century french town unfolds as they seek out the adventurous, and bring out the spirit in them.  Opening a chocolate shop at the beginning of lent separates the daring from the subdued.  The appearance of Johnny Depp and his Gypsy friends on the banks of the local river create even more conflict between the conservative, who regard the \\"River Rats\\" as imoral, and the radical, who welcome the \\"pirates\\" as exotic friends.  The escalating conflict and its finale show everyone their true, adventurous nature.  By the end of the movie, you're convinced one smart woman has brought out the beauty in everyone.  <br />And there you have it: a smorgasbord for your senses that pulls at and cheers your heart.  Enjoy!

B0000CDLA7|5.0|*FAVOURITE Album this year*<br />First of all, there are many pointless and to me offensive reviews in here pointing out that its 'nu-metal' and 'boring'. First of all, the 'nu-metal' sounds incorporated in this CD are harmonics in the chorus of 'Endless Sacrifice' and some rather catchy (and simple) riffs in other songs. However, people hate this genre so much that any resemlence means that the album sucks, which is definately not the case. Other complaints are about the heaviness of the album. These are made by many people who are more into 'Prog rock' like Rush and Genesis and can't really get into the grooves from the riffs as well. This album, needless to say for everyone, takes a little while to get used to. So please, disregard some reviews here!<br />Overall, I was very impressed with this album. Dream Theater are going where they have never gone before, yet keeping their trademark sound and still doing what they do best. Because this is still very PROG. Most songs are over 10 minutes. 'As I Am' is probably the weakest track, set up to get radio play and it HAS gotten some reception from US radio. The song features a catchy 'Metallica'-esque main riff and catchy vocal lines. However, maybe the only minor drawback in the album is really apparent in this song: guitar solos. While many are great, few have the creativity of Petrucci in his early 90s. But I am nitpicking as most are VERY good. <BR>The most impressive performance by far was from Jordan Rudess. He has revamped his solo tone to a more aggressive 'guitar-like' tone, and he also uses a lot more bends, vibrato, and other guitar effects, which add a lot more heart to his solos (a lot more restrained), some of his solos used to sound like a Midi sequencer, not so on this album. Myung has been stepped up in the mix and he takes advantage of this with a solid (as usual) performance and some great basslines. His highlight was in the \\"In The Name of God\\" instrumental section, putting down some MASSIVE grooves!! Portnoy's outing was again solid, not his best but there were some great beats and fills! LaBrie put in probably his best performance, mixing his aggressive low vocals with distortions and even rapping (done tastefully). In a couple of songs even his high-pitched voice shined through, but not with that annoying quality that was there in his first two albums with the band!<BR>Other highlights: <BR>Guitar riffs - Lot's of catchy and complex riffs here! Metal fans will love it! <BR>Background Keyboards - More laid back, but still has key contributions in most songs! Rudess uses piano, rock organ, and even some mellotron, as well as other effects. He sounds a lot more like Kevin Moore here!<BR>INSTRUMENTAL SECTIONS - Best sections since Images And Words. Contrary to many reviews, the majority of the instrumental sections concentrate on GROOVE and interesting riffs/keyboard melodys rather than solos. Virtousity is kept in check, and unleashed at times with great effect (unison runs!).<br />Fav. Song: I would have to say \\"In The Name of God\\". The perfect metal riff, perfect vocals, great lyrics, and a killer instrumental section. <br />THE BAD:<BR>- The virtuosity may be a bit over the top. However, I would like this type of playing over radio rock anyday! <BR>- Too heavy...this may be debated, but for some fans this may not be their cup of tea, try Images and Words if you are more into Progressive!<br />THE VERDICT: Their most focused release since 'Awake'. The riffs are gorgeous, instrumental sections are top-notch, all the musicians are at their best, and it lacks the 'cheesiness' of Six Degrees and Scenes From A Memory. This is getting mixed reviews from rock 'purists' but if you like metal, have an open mind, and like rock thats played by intelligent musicians, buy this as soon as you can! <br />***** (5 Stars)
B00008O31H|4.0|I HATE reading these reviews because everyone claims, &quot;oh yeah, they're kind of like the White Stripes...&quot;, so I thought I would do that too, sort of.  Just because the White Stripes use guitar and drums does NOT put them on the same level as the Black Keys.  How so you ask?  The Black Keys can actually play their instruments and sound different when doing so.  This is one of the most originally crafted Rock/Blues albums that I have heard in a while.  The grungy garage rock feel of the record gives you a certain sense of warmth when listening to it that stays with you for hours.  If you don't own this record yet then I just feel sorry for you...
B0000DD7NL|5.0|Lush. That's the best word to describe the sonic odyssey Ms. Keys takes you on this time. Her first album, the spectacular 'Songs in A Minor' held forth the promise of greater things to come, but who knew she'd deliver so quickly, so deeply... this record is yummy. This record is throw-a-log-on-the-fire-and-make-love-on-the-floor-of-every-room-in-the-house-all-weekend goodness. May the music gods be praised, someone, this someone, still writes SONGS. My choice for best album of 2003? Well, there's still under a month left to try to beat it.
B00008OLYN|5.0|*#3 on My Top Albums of 2003*<br />This may have been a shock for Opeth fans everywhere. However, it was a pleasant suprise for me as this was the first album I got from a band that I was curious about. I didn't want to spend money on their other albums and not like the death metal vox. If you want to check the bands sound out, this is a definate FIRST buy. I later got used to their death metal stuff and Opeth are among my favourite bands!<BR>As for the album, you could compare it with 70s prog, and atmospheric rock like Pink Floyd, but the closest band to this album would be Porcupine Tree. And their frontman Steve Wilson came in and did a great job producing: adding back up vocals, doing the keyboard/piano stuff, and writing lyrics to one song.<BR>The album really focuses on sadness,depression, and loss, and the artwork (rather Gothic) perfectly reflects the mood of the music!<br />This album is really focused on drumming. Martin Lopez was a jazz drummer before this and his style fits perfectly on this album. Beats are fantastic, and many times he just jumps in and leads the whole band with some very creative fills. He's not overbearing on the drums, and because this is a very light album he uses the intricacy and subtlety of jazz drumming to his utmost advantage! This is probably my favourite drumming performance of the year. <BR>Another highlight was the guitars. An abundance of beautiful acoustics, mournful melody, and piercing (yet peaceful) solos. Michael Akerfeldt's voice is also the most clear and beautiful-sounding one he has ever recorded. His tone seems touched with remorse, and it fits the album perfectly. <BR>Overall, this album shows off Opeth at their most creative, subtle, with their amazing ear for dynamics especially being used in 'Damnation'. My favourite time to listen to this would be at night or on a rainy Sunday afternoon, maybe not for a party or an exciting occaison.<br />But this is definately a redefining album from a death metal band, truely showing how diverse they can be! Can't wait for their DVD 'Lamentations' out in Europe in November, and in North America/Internationally on February 24th, 2004!
B00009TB5G|5.0|Ever since The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring arrived in theaters in December 2001, there has been an ever-growing obsession with J.R.R. Tolkien that has engulfed millions of people world-wide.  Director Peter Jackson, and countless other actors believe without a doubt that The Lord of the Rings trilogy has already made cinematic history.  With its epic scenes, well-developed characters, and unmatchable special effects, The Lord of the Rings could very well be as excellent as Star Wars, if not better.  Peter Jackson could quite possibly be giving George Lucas and run for his money.  In Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers, the heart-wrenching story of four hobbits and the gripping suspense for the battle of Middle-earth will leave audiences begging for more.<BR> Unlike the first movie, The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring, the characters of Frodo and Sam are much more developed and intensified in The Two Towers.  As Frodo and Sam begin their journey alone, in pursuit of the destruction of the ring, Frodo's deteriorating soul is ultimately revealed to the audience.  Since the power of the ring intensifies, Frodo unconsciously becomes more dependent on Sam in order to successfully destroy the ring.  The damage the ring has on Frodo's mind and well-being causes the audience to wonder what type of fate lies ahead for Frodo.<BR> When Gollum was first introduced to the audience in The Fellowship of the Ring, he remained a mystery as far as who he really was and what his purpose was in the story.  As soon as Gollum joins Frodo and Sam in their endeavor, Gollum's severe case of schizophrenia brings his inner turmoil to the audiences' attention.  It is also revealed that Gollum's real name is Smeagle and the name of Gollum belongs to his evil alter ego who appears to have full control of Smeagle.  Smeagle's battle with Gollum causes the audience to have tremendous pity for him, which alters his persona of a monster to a kind-hearted, suffering soul.In the scene where Gollum engages in a verbal battle with Smeagle, the true spirit of Smeagle is brought to light with an amazing script and an impeccable development of character.<BR> A major restoration of hope arrives and perpetuates when Gandalf returns to the story after falling to shadow in The Fellowship of the Ring.  The exasperation of excitement and relief heard in the theaters when Gandalf appeared on the screen only solidified this idea.  With Gandalf back in the picture, the Battle at Helms Deep is anticipated with victory.  Instead of the title Gandalf the Grey in The Fellowship of the Ring, Gandalf's reincarnation promoted him to Gandalf the White, making him much more powerful.  Since Gandalf was somehow reincarnated, his fate lies in the unknown as well.<BR> While the story continues, the world-wide anticipation for the final movie will only grow in massive proportions.  Although The Two Towers answered many questions that arose from The Fellowship of the Ring, it only gave birth to new questions and inquiries that can only be answered with the release of The Return of the King.  After witnessing the success of the first two movies, it can only be expected the third movie will indeed earn colossal success.  In addition, the Lord of the Rings trilogy is sure to establish its place in box office history.  Until December 17, 2003, when The Return of the King is released, the audience will be anxiously awaiting.
B00009TB5G|1.0|Do not buy this set until New Line fixes the problem with discs 3 and 4. As mentioned in other reviews, these discs will not play on certain DVD players. I have a Zenith DVD/VCR combo, less than one year old, and I have had the exact same problem with 2 different sets. I just received my replacement set today for the one I returned, and it has the exact same problem as the first. Both discs get &quot;hung up&quot; between track 1 and 2 as soon as you insert them into a DVD (they work on a PC) and you never get past the blank screen. To make it worse, I let disc three in the player for a few minutes just now, thinking it might eventually play. It got stuck im my DVD player for over 10 minutes and would not eject. The DVD player kept making a loud humming noise, even when I turned it off! I thought I had ruined the DVD player, but after numerous frantic button pushing, the disc finally ejected. The problem is with New Line, and until they fix this defect I do not recommend you buy this set, especially if you have a Zenith DVD (or Sony like the reviewer below has). I love Tolkein and desperately want this set, but not until this defect is repaired!

B00009TB5G|5.0|I have been a fan of Tolkien since reading the books in grade school.  I was initially skeptical that these classics could be brought to life in a film, but those fears were completely erased after the first film was released.  That one, The Fellowship of the Ring, was even better with the extended release.  However, the difference is not nearly as profound as the Two Towers extended version.<br />Simply put, this extended release changes the film in a dramatic way.  New scenes depict a rich tapestry of relationship that was not allowed to develop, being buried under an avalanche of battles in the theatrical release.  This is not the same version with added &quot;deleted scenes&quot; but rather a different film altogether! My special favorite was the one scene I looked forward to, and was dismayed to see not in the theatrical release:  Merri and Pippen raiding the stores of Sauroman and finding barrels of Shire &quot;pipe weed&quot;!<br />If you are at all a fan of this series, DO NOT MISS this extended version. It is easily worth the price. You will never watch the cut version again.  Absolutely brilliant!

B000001IPP|5.0|This is the best cd in my collection. I still listen to this cd all the time, even after i have had it for 2 years. If you like Rancid or want to hear them for the first time, deffinately buy this classic cd.
B000099T2L|3.0|It has the two popular songs other than she can probably milk out one more hit song from it if she advertises it as much as the other songs. I didn't like baby boy right of the bat, but after hearing so much I like it. I don't like some of the songs, but they are still decent songs, but I don't know if it is because I expected the CD to be as good as the ones of Destiny Child. Maybe I will like it when i hear them a million times on the radio, and on T.V., but so far i just like 3 songs  Crazy in Love, Baby Boy, and me, myself and I.

B0000CEB4V|5.0|I didn't know what to expect when I was given this DVD. George's voice was not the most listenable of the four and, truthfully, the quality of his vocals sometimes detracted from the song itself. That said, these songs, played by &quot;George's Band&quot; as put together by Eric Clapton, take on a whole new life, and the lyrical and melodious content of his writing - particularly his post Beatles' material - comes alive in a way I didn't appreciate before this concert. The sound and the musicianship is phenomenal for a band that rehearsed about 3 weeks. Ravi Shankar's composition and the playing of his daughter were also impressive, if not mystifying. Add a couple of irreverent skits by Monty Python, and it is a joyous occasion. You watch as these musicians smile at each other and sing along with the songs while nowhere near a mike, and you understand the impact Harrison's music had on these individuals. I have a greater appreciation for the music of the man - western and eastern - as well as his sense of humor. When one can say the weakest spot in the entire show were two songs by Tom Petty &amp; the Heartbreakers, one might understand just how good this concert was. Thankyou, Eric, for approaching Olivia and Dhani with this idea that came to fruition a year to the day after George's death. And thanks to all who partcipated - including Tom Hanks - for giving us a proper farewell to what I feel was the spiritual and mystical soul of the Beatles. 'See you in my dreams.'
B0000E64TR|5.0|I have about 20-25 sacds and about 20 dvd audio discs and this one is my new favorite. It sets a new standard in my mind. The mixing was perfect, the quality of the sound put me down in my seat. I just sat back in my recliner through the entire album and let the sound roll over me. I used to skip some songs on the album but now these are ones that I fully appreciate now that I can hear how fantastic they really are. <br />You may not be able to appreciate  how good these 5.1 SACD's are unless you have 5 good full range speakers with a decent amp, connections, speaker wire. So please judge them with the understanding that you need an adequate system to play them on to really appreciate them.
B00005QIPH|1.0|I still habe a hard time believing that this CD and bands like this one actually sell CDs to anyone other than 10 year old kids trying to learn how to play the guitar, and yet, we have people actually listening and enjoying this drivel. Has the rock world and record companies sunk so low that they have to sell this junk by shoving it down your throat by having the radio stations play it a minimum of 5 times a day? there is no attempt at creative song making, creative lyrics, nor anything more than a simple beat, the same riff, and bass line, and a very boring singer who's hardly on key. bottom line: dont buy this CD, dont waste your money, unless you wanna buy into the whole \\"im a drone and pawn of record companies and radio stations and listen to what i am told is cool\\" genre, cause this is boring, mindnumbing and just a tad awful, Hey Amazon, where's the zero star button?
B0000E64TQ|5.0|I have many SACDs and DVD Audio discs but none hit me as hard as this one did. I was floored at the sound quality and the perfection of the mixing job for a 5.1 system. I never appreciated this album fully until now. Please get full range speakers for all 5 speakers to truly benefit from these SACD's.
B0000CDL93|5.0|I'm surprised, after 40 years, that so much effort is still made to discredit Jim Garrison's investigation of the assassination of President Kennedy and Oliver Stone's telling movie &quot;JFK&quot;.<br />Peter Jennings and ABC made a &quot;heroic&quot; effort to convince viewers that Oswald was a &quot;lone nut&quot; assassin. Even PBS sold out with their &quot;Frontline&quot; program, and a couple of others, about the JFK assassination.<br />As someone who has studied the JFK assassination, as an avocation, since 1968, I highly recommend Oliver Stone's &quot;JFK&quot; as an excellent starting point to understanding why Kennedy was assassinated.<br />Stone had to abbreviate the story. How could any film cover everything that happened from before Kennedy took the oath of office in January of 1961 until the trial of Clay Shaw in 1969 in a couple of hours? It isn't possible unless some artistic license is taken. An example is &quot;X&quot;, the mysterious military colonel, who was based on more than one person but primarily on Col. L. Fletcher Prouty (who wrote the excellent book &quot;JFK: The CIA, Vietnam and the Plot to Assassinate John F. Kennedy&quot;. The conversation, in the film &quot;JFK&quot;, between &quot;X&quot; and District Attorney Jim Garrison, never took place. But it precisely summed up events which happened over a long period of time in the planning and execution of the assassination. If not for these kinds of artistic license a movie spanning nearly nine years would have to be several years long to include all details exactly as they happened.<br />The jury in the Clay Shaw trial believed there was a conspiracy, they just didn't have the proof they needed to convict Shaw. And it was no wonder they couldn't. The FBI, CIA and many other government entities did everything they could to thwart Garrison's investigation. His offices were bugged, &quot;volunteers&quot; removed stacks of documents, The FBI threatened his investigators, witnesses were murdered, Governors refused to extradite key witnesses, the judge wouldn't allow the police officer who booked Clay Shaw to testify that Shaw said he used the alias Clay Bertrand when being booked ... no D.A. could win a case under those circumstances. Even Johnny Carson, on NBC's &quot;The Tonight Show&quot;, attacked Garrison over national television.<br />Garrison did a remarkable job, under the circumstances, of coming close to solving the assassination. Garrison's book &quot;On The Trail of the Assassins: My Investigation and Prosecution of the Murder of President Kennedy&quot; illustrates exactly what he was up against in bringing Clay Shaw to trial. If you can find this book buy it.<br />Why is the Kennedy assassination of any importance 40 years later? You have to understand what happened then to understand what has happened since. Why would the government, the media, authors, television program producers and others want to make you belive a lone nut assassin killed our President? Why did so many witnesses die so quickly? Why was evidence destroyed and modified? Why was Oswald silenced by Jack Ruby? Why was Oswald given Russian language training while in the Marines, sent to work at the largest CIA military base in Asia, then allowed to &quot;defect&quot; to Russia? Why would our government stand by and do nothing when Oswald tells the U.S. Embassy that he wants to give up his U.S. citizenship and says he is going to give Russia secrets about our U2 flights? Why would he be allowed to do that? Why, when he wanted to come back to the U.S., was he promptly given his passport, never debriefed, and even given travel money by a CIA cover group? Why wouldn't he be charged with treason? Why did Oswald pretend to be pro-Castro working out of the office of Guy Banister, a private investigator who was former ONI (Office of Naval Intelligence) and former head of the Chicago office of the F.B.I.? Why would Oswald hang out in a place within a couple of blocks of the Secret Service, the F.B.I., the C.I.A. and the O.N.I. offices in New Orleans if he had truly defected to Russia? Was Oswald being set up to be the &quot;patsy&quot; for the assassination? Why didn't the Warren Commission take Jack Ruby to Washington, D.C. where he said he could tell the truth? Why did Ruby suddenly contract a virulent form of colon cancer in his lungs just after being told he would get a re-trial? He claimed he was being injected with cancer and he died within a couple of months. Why would JFK's brain disapper from the National Archives along with autopsy photos? Why did LBJ have the limousine flown to Ford Motor Company and the windshield with a bullet hole removed and destroyed, as well as the carpet and parts of the interior replaced destroying that evidence. These, and hundreds of other questions, will come up as you watch &quot;JFK&quot; and do some searching on the internet.
B000007MVU|5.0|When we look back at the rock and roll and pop history we have the tendency to overlook some of the greatest artist that made it. Ringo is perhaps the most overlooked man of the industry. Besides being a very good and creative drummer (can You imagine &quot;Come Together&quot; with Neil Peart playing on?), He could sing, write songs (classics such as &quot;Don't Pass Me By&quot;, &quot;it don't come easy&quot; and other) and perform as an actor. In 1970 he made the release of two ambitious albums,one of standarts (Sentimental Journey) and other of country  music (Beacoups of Blues). Both represents the artist's integrity, since Ringo loved both country music and standarts. The two albuns are in fact very inovative - An ex-beatle putting out these weird albuns was like a sacrilege. However, artists such as Neil Young, Bob Dylan, and even Dean Martin could, without major problems or attacks from fans worldwide, put out their country albuns. In the same way, people that points the finger to Ringo for &quot;Sentimental Journey&quot; probably don't have nothing against Rod Stewart's or Brian Ferry's albuns of standarts. The fact is that after the release of his first two &quot;conceptual&quot; albuns, in 1973 Ringo was topping the charts with &quot;Photograph&quot; and &quot;You're 16&quot; (Ringo were #1 in the charts even before Lennon). Nothing bad for the &quot;luckiest man on Earth&quot;, who, in years to come would release &quot;TIME TAKES TIME&quot; &quot;Ringo Rama&quot; and that X-mas album that everybody loves.
B0000DZEA1|3.0|A very good soundtrack, but I expected more.  After hearing Fellowship of the Ring and The Two Towers, The Return of the King is quite disappointing.<br />A great example is the Fields of Pelennor.  I don't feel the action like I did with the action pieces of TTT.<br />Annie Lennox's song is awesome, but it just doesn't compare with Enya's May It Be.<br />The Two Towers soundtrack is the best, followed by Fellowship, then Return of the King.
B0000AOV85|3.0|I was hoping for at least some original concert footage.  This disk is comprised of about 1/3 original studio footage (very cool), and 2/3 VH1-style contemporary interviews of the members, Alan Parsons, and a haggardly journalist who makes Keith Richards look like a health freak... -- this is all great the first 3 times ,,,,,,,, then memorized.
B000002HH2|5.0|Bjork's second solo CD is her most eclectic work so far, and even more sonically adventurous than her excellent &quot;Debut&quot;. Diverse as it is, though, the great thing about Bjork is that her music is always unmistakably hers (partially due to her one-of-a-kind voice, but also due to her exuberant strangeness). With the hard-hitting opening track &quot;Army of Me&quot;, Bjork scolds someone for their self-pity and laziness. &quot;Hyper-ballad&quot; and &quot;The Modern Things&quot; are both fanciful and inventive techno-infused tracks. &quot;It's Oh So Quiet&quot; is a charming big band throwback, while the Tricky-produced &quot;Enjoy&quot; and Headphones&quot; are both abrasive, erotic love songs. Overall, this album is a brilliant, experimental smorgasbord.

The two former agents join forces to try to find out who is behind these incidents.  The plot becomes convoluted and complex as many people seem to have a motive for masterminding the kidnapping and the murder, but nothing seems to tie the two together.  A third person enters the picture as King's former lover Joan joins the investigation.  Baldacci is a slick writer and he knows how to weave a web of plot and then to unravel it when the moment is right.  The ending does stretch credibility, but suspending disbelief has its rewards in an entertaining read.
B0000DD7LB|5.0|At first, I was like, oh no, not ANOTHER Britney CD. But then I told myself I'll just buy it... what harm could it do? I listened to the songs, they really have a nice beat, especially the duet with Madonna. This is probably her best CD. She<BR>messed up on the last album, but this one shows effort, and I believe in second chances.
B00009TB5G|5.0|As an artist of various mediums, myself, I watch The Lord of the Rings and my critical analysis runs like this: Compared to the accomplishment this film project represents, I feel like I can't skip and chew gum at the same time. And if I live a thousand years, I may never create the likes of this work by Jackson and his friends. My considered advise to detractors of the film: Take a look at the sum of all your contributions to art, and if you still feel you qualify to comment, then by all means go for it. In that case we may elect to be drug down by your disappointment. Otherwise, as they say, better keep your day jobs.
0790729369|4.0|I loved this film.  It was very sad and tragic, much like most people's lives are when they hit their 40's and 50's.  It has exceptional acting from its main stars, Streep and Eastwood, however the opening scenes had horrible acting from the surviving children of the main character.  That is the only reason it got 4 stars from me instead of 5.<BR>I really enjoyed the final 20 minutes or so.  Without giving the plot away, it moved me in a way that cannot be described, only lived.  If you want to watch one of the best romantic stories ever put on film....get this film!
B00006JDVV|3.0|*SYNOPSIS* ~ At the age of twelve, Quinn Abercromby (Ben Thornton) is the first to lay eyes upon an enormous fire-breathing dragon. As his mother is a construction engineer, she and her crew inadvertly awaken the deadly creature. Now, eighteen years later, it is the year 2020. The earth has changed as the dragon and his offspring have scorched the earth and the human race is on the brink of extinction. Grown up Quinn (Christian Bale) now leads a community of English men, women, and children as they struggle to survive in Northumberland. But the future looks grim, their existence is only the stretching out of the inevitable; that the humans will not last long. One day, a U.S. military commander Denton Van Zan (Matthew McConaughey) shows up with a small battalion of tanks and an Apache gunship, flown by pilot Alexandra 'Alex' Jenson (Izabella Scorupco).  <br />The meeting between Quinn and Van Zan immediately becomes a clash of wills as the two stubborn individuals have decidedly different outlooks on their bleak future. While Quinn believes that he and his band of survivors can hide and outlive the dragons, Van Zan believes their only chance is to destroy the creatures once and for all by executing a daring plan. There will be no compromise for the two men, yet both of them know that they are running out of time...<br />*PLOT* ~ &quot;Reign of Fire&quot; has all the elements you would want in a good movie; interesting plot, appealing actors, and great effects. But unfortunately, the movie really doesn't flow very well. The biggest problem is that the plot seems to have been forgotten when they were writing the screenplay. <br />The first 50 minutes you're shown how desperate the situation is, and there's some fantastic action scenes. Finally then we're given a look on how the film is going to end; you finally hear about what the daring plan is to save the world. In my opinion, the audience is left a little too much on their own during the first half of the film, having to rely on rewinding to catch what is going on. The last action sequence was sooo great, then suddenly, the story ends, leaving you feeling empty. There was no real triumph to the story at the end. And I think that this fact was the most disappointing, one of the key elements in creating a good movie is to have a satisfying ending, whether it be happy or sad. In &quot;Reign of Fire&quot;, you seriously cannot make up your mind which it is. <BR> <BR>*ACTING* ~ I was first inspired to rent this movie out when I found out that Christian Bale starred in it. And of all the cast, he was the only who seemed to handle his character well. He's the 'reluctant hero', a tough yet soft-hearted man, the kind of character everyone loves. In all of his movies he's proved he can handle almost any role, from a Neo-like Grammaton Cleric (&quot;Equilibrium&quot;), a singing and dancing teenage newsie (&quot;Newsies&quot;), a sweet and irresistable young man (&quot;Little Women&quot;), a young boy on a journey for survival in a war torn country (&quot;Empire of the Sun&quot;), and countless other films. And besides being talented, he's also extremely good looking. ^_^<br />Matthew McConaughy on the other hand leaves much to be desired for. Too gruff, too gritty, too many tattoos, and overall his character wasn't very likable. His character seems too overdone and McConaughy's acting is also overdone. Disappointing after seeing his marvelous performance in &quot;U-571&quot;. I also wouldn't have minded seeing more of Izabella Scorupco (James Bond girl in &quot;Goldeneye&quot; oppposite Pierce Brosnan). In my opinion, there really should have been more romance between her and Christian Bale's character, they were sweet together but not even one kiss! That's one of the downers to the film.<br />*ACTION, EFFECTS, CINEMATOGROPHY* ~ Ok, the filmmakers may have done a grave mistake in not putting more depth in the plot, but they must be applauded for wonderful action, effects, cinematogrophy. The action sequences are incredible, including the breathtaking ArchAngels scenes and the last scene (I mustn't spoil it!). As for effects, the dragons are so shockingly real, it's hard to believe they're only CG characters. All the fire and explosions are also well-done.<br />*PG-13 RATING* ~ The movie is rated PG-13 for intense action violence. Also, there are profanities scattered all throughout the movie so for parents who are worried about the language, I recommend to watch before letting their kids see.<br />*OVERALL* ~ Overall, the movie was a gritty, action packed experience. Pretty good characters, so-so plot, and great effects, &quot;Reign of Fire&quot; is a movie I recommend you rent out before you make the ultimate choice in owning the movie for your own movie collection. If you're a Christian Bale fan, this is a must-see for sure. But if you're a Matthew McConaughy fan, I'd rather recommend you watch &quot;U-571&quot;.
B0000E1WKE|5.0|Whitney shines on this album! Once again she shows exactly why she's always been heads above the rest. I'm always amazed at the depth and soulfulness of her voice. I pray that this is the resurrection of the old Whitney and that she's here to stay. I love this lady and her music!
B00005JM02|5.0|I think I've had this movie for all of 2 weeks and I have watched it 4 times!  And I am 27 years old with no kids!  It's just a great movie all around.  Fantastic animation, wonderfully funny characters and an original storyline.  There's plenty of humor in here for kids, but also enough so the adults watching it with the little ones can laugh out loud too!<br />Ellen Degeneres is classic as Dory--the short-term-memory-loss inflicted fish.  Practically everything she does in the film will elicit a laugh.  There are several scenes that I watch over and over again.<br />The movie is about a young clown fish named Nemo and his father, Marlin.  Nemo is captured from his reef by some divers and his father goes out into the ocean to search for him.  Along the way, Marlin encounters Dory and a host of other sea creatures that eventually lead him to Sydney, where Nemo is being held hostage as a present for young Darla.  Marlin's adventures in the &quot;big blue&quot; teach him that being overprotective isn't the best way to raise his son.  It's a great message and the enounters along the way are simply hilarious.  I don't want to give away any more of the plot...you'll have to watch and see!<br />There are so many extras with this DVD.  I liked the deleted scenes and director's commentary.  It's really amazing what kind of work goes into making an animated film of this magnitude.  Most of the deleted scenes are not fully animated, but it's an educational process just the same.  <br />All in all, this is sure to be a classic.  You will find yourself reciting lines from this movie almost immediately.  It's great for people of all ages, it's got a great message, the animation is crisp and realistic, and the characters are funny and have depth.  It's not what most people expect out of an animated film.  I don't know anyone who has seen this movie that doesn't rave about it!  A GREAT GIFT!
B0000VCZK2|5.0|This is by far the best DVD set I have ever seen. A new bar has been set.
B0000DD7LC|2.0|Alicia Keys's sophomore album suffers from the sophomore slump.  Unlike the first album there was nothing I liked in this CD, the music, the lyrics, everything. <br />Generally uninteresting and disappointing.
0393057658|5.0|Money Ball, by Michael Lewis, is a non-fiction story about the success of Billy Beane, the current manager of the Oakland Athletics.  It tells the story of his failure trying to make it to the major leagues as a boy out of high school, and what caused his breakdown.  He was one of the premiere draft prospects in the country out of high school.  However, he didn't want his future from high school to be in the major leagues.  He wanted to study at Stanford, but when he said he didn't want to play baseball there, his acceptance was revoked, and he ended up getting drafted into the big leagues in the first round.  After struggling in the minors for years, and only starting a few games in the majors, he retired before turning thirty, and asked to work in the front office for the Oakland Athletics as an advance scout.  His heart wasn't in playing baseball.  \\"In the end, Billy proved what he had been trying to say at least since he was seventeen years old:  he didn't want to play ball.\\"- Michael Lewis.  After being a scout for the Athletics for some time, Billy Beane became the manager of the team.  New management caused the Athletics to go from their high payroll status to a low-budget team.  He had learned that the key to running a cost efficient baseball team was to look at the players' statistics, and to look for players who had experience playing in college, even though scouts looked mostly at high school players.  Billy Beane had learned from a famous sports writer, Bill James, that on-base percentage was the key statistic for baseball.  From that point, Billy Beane was looking for players who had statistics to prove their worth, and the statistics he looked at were on-base percentage and slugging percentage, because Billy Beane wanted players who could get on base and hit.<br /> The theme of the book is that, in life, you shouldn't always have to do what you're good at, you should do what you want and like to do.  Billy Beane proves this by retiring as a baseball player, and going to work in the front office as a scout, because he still loved the game.  His determination allowed him to quickly work his way into the manager position of the team, and from then he worked harder than ever to create a successful baseball team.  This relates to my life because while I am good at punting and like to play football, I'm not really interested in going on to play in college.  My friends and family are all encouraging me to play, but my heart really isn't in football.<br /> I would definitely recommend this book to everyone, especially baseball fans, because it gives a good in-depth look into how baseball teams are run.  It is especially intriguing because it shows how effectively Billy Beane runs the low-budget Oakland Athletics, which is one of the best teams in the majors currently.
0786915749|5.0|I remmeber this book was the most amazing tale when i was a kid. I read it recently, and i was a bit taken aback by how easy it was to fly through. Maybe its a bit Harry Potteresque. For a kid, the characters jump out of the pages and take you into the world with them. I dont think ive ever been as encapsulated in a story ever again. I remmeber at the end of the 3rd book crying and crying because i felt all my freinds had just died. Sad eh?<br />The one disturbing this i heard was the authors are Mormons, and the stuff about &quot;the true gods&quot; is them trying to push their religion is a kind of abstract way.<br />This may also be complete rubbish.<br />Anyway, i couldnt bring myslef to give it anything but 5 stars, as it pretty much was the defining series of my childhood.
B0000C0FJB|4.0|Yeah the sound might be better but it's not unlistenable (I'm no audiophile, I just know what I like - RUSH).  Frankly I don't consider the audience &quot;noise&quot; a bug, it's a feature.  I do miss Red Barchetta and the bulk of 2112, but the balance of the setlist remains true dynamite.  If you like the guys - and who doesn't? - you'll find something to like in this recording.
0671027387|4.0|I must say, the beginning of this book compared to the Da Vinci Code was rather drab.  It was a tad boring and it took me two months to get through the first 50 pages.  Yes, TWO MONTHS.  The library sent me two overdue notices and I decided to quickly try and finish it up so that my checking the book out was not a waste.  I finished the 400 pages in 2 days.  It was so good.  It captured my attention and my mom would get mad at me and tell me to go to sleep.  I would tensely tell her \\"I think Pickering just died!\\"  She knew not to bother me.  I read the book till late into the night.  I finished late the next morning.  It was good good good.  But the Da Vinci Code was better.<br />Oh, and one more thing.  I think Dan Brownn should come up with more creative endings.  They all end the same.  It is quite trashy.
B000002N3J|5.0|Tired of the same old fluff ballads by people like Sarah McLaughlin? Check out Madonna's &quot;Something To Remember.&quot; Many ballads have surfaced in the mid-late 80's and 90's, but many of them were by artists who are more well known for their voices (Whitney, Mariah, Celine to name a few0 and the songs were down-right sappy. Thankfully Madonna changes that. Even if you're not a ballad lover, &quot;Something To Remember&quot; is for you. Madonna takes the fluff out of ballads. Some like &quot;This Used To Be My Playground&quot; and &quot;Oh Father&quot; will bring you to tears. &quot;Live To Tell&quot; and the &quot;Babyface&quot;-produced &quot;Take A Bow&quot; are also highlights. Want CD full of mellow jams with a lot of meaning? Check out Madonna's &quot;Something To Remember.&quot; Makes good background music for parties and people will be surprised it's Madonna. Also check out &quot;Come Away With Me&quot; by Norah Jones.
0385504209|4.0|I rather liked the book.  I read it in one night.  night/morning.  But the ending was rather...cliche or used too often.  the ending is very corny and trashy.  i don't like it at all.  but the plot was pretty good and fast paced.
B000066744|4.0|&quot;The Legend of 1900&quot; is a very nice film that is enjoyable to watch.  Being a huge fan of ragtime, jazz, and piano music in general, I would say that the film is worth watching for the soundtrack alone.  It is really the music that carries this film for me.  The story is a bit strained and I don't particularly feel any empathy for the main character.  But the music is gorgeous and the sets are wonderfully intimate and detailed. I agree with one reviewer: you will watch particular scenes over and over.  My recommendation?  Buy a used copy (DVD) and enjoy the film.
B00005JKWJ|4.0|Blade 2 is one of those films on a par with Die Hard, the Matrix and Lord Of The Rings. An extremely basic plot driven by effects and directorial brilliance... and losing nothing along the way. <BR>The plot is nothing new, the concept of Blade having to make an uneasy alliance with his vampire prey is not a surprising idea. Neither is introducing an uber-vampire into the Blade mythos. But you overlook these details, and you realise, that what you are presented with is one of the best action films to date. <BR>It's the Reapers you remember the most, with their crack-addict bloodshot eyes and that mouth which will just blow you away. Seriously, it's a real surprise the first time you see it in action. I back-tracked a few frames on the DVD and played it in slow motion, I couldn't believe what I was seeing. It was such an interesting take on vampires.<BR>Aside from the effects, which do most of the talking and are what you remember after watching it, you really get a sense that Del Toro really knows his stuff and how to make each new scene interesting. Many films are described as a roller-coaster ride; this one's like being caught in the eye of a hurricane.<BR>However, there are points for improvement:<BR> - we've seen the silent, bad-ass soldier guys with names you never remember. Alien Ressurection had them, and you just don't care for nameless bad-asses. If more stress was put on them as being characters, with other emotions besides 'I'm gonna whup me some ass', we'd feel more for them.<BR> - Jared Nomak generated a lot of pathos all the way through the film. You never really saw him as the bad guy, only the reapers that came about from his feeding. This makes the battle royal between him and Blade seem a tad... pointless (although removing it would have been an anti-climax). More could have been done to show that Nomak was just coping with an addiction; Del Toro says on the director's commentary, 'I wanted the Reapers to look like crack addicts'. <BR> - Give Bladea more devil-may-care attitude, a more fun-loving one. We see a bit of this when he straps an explosive device to the back of Ron Pearlman's head. Show that he actually has fun when he's slicing off heads and tearing out vertebrae.<BR>Other than these details, which you can overlook because they aren't important and are only my suggestions for improvement, Blade 2 is worth every penny, especially the bonus material... if like me, you're into your monsters, you're in for a treat.
6305313687|4.0|From an incredibly unknown director, \\"American History X\\" is a powerful film that brings the audience face-to-face with white supremacy.  But this is not the easily dismissed, ignorant white supremacy that is represented in so many films these days.  Rather, it is white supremacy in the mind of an extremely intelligent young man played by Edward Norton.  While anyone with reasonable intelligence can see the holes in Derek Vinyard's logic, the arguments themselves are delivered with powerful and forceful eloquence that is absolutely shocking.  Norton's performance is riveting; I am constantly amazed at the depth of his acting ability.  One is able to go from hating him to being moved by him to absolutely routing for him-all in the same film.<br />The movie is extremely graphic and moving.  \\"American History X\\" is not your typical film about racism and violence.  It manages to emerge from the rubble and provide a positive message for those of us who are left to deal with the world.  Hate is learned; one can see that in the lives of these two neo-Nazis.  But it can also be forgotten.  The most important thing, however, is to never learn to hate in the first place.  Not only does this film provide insight into the making of a racist, it empathizes with those who are unwittingly caught up in the false logic the white supremacists sell.  Many movies try to dismiss those who hate.  This film tries to understand where they are coming from and shows us how close we all are to crossing the line.  I highly recommend this film to everyone.
B000003S09|5.0|i was introduced to KC by listening to tool.  i was very satisfied with my first listen of the lp.  the almost perfectly crafted songs are just treats to my ears.  i  am a music lover and this is the reason why.  i didn't know what to expect having never heard KC, but i was just blown away by the music.  my favorite is moonchild.  just beautifully crafted and written.  the long instrumental is just a tease of the full splendor of KC's talents so it is all good.  epitaph is a grandly conceived modern masterpiece in its own right.  i could fill this review with musical terms but it is pointless because this album represents a movement that transcends the very music it exhibits. enjoy without any expectation.
B0000CAQ27|1.0|If you liked her first 2 albums, you will hate this one. The music doesn't have any hooks! I hate this album. There isn't one song that grabs your attention. Good luck on finding singles for this one, Pink!
0783227434|5.0|Being an Evil Dead fan, I find it interesting how Bruce Campbells character changes and grows from one movie to the next. In Army of Darkness, he is a hero type who is trying to save the world from evil, but does it in a humorous and comical way. This is definetely a must see, especially for those true horror fans. The best thing to do is see all the evil dead series to completely appreciate it. Oh, and can't forget that this movie has the best one liners...Give me some sugar baby!
B0000TB03W|5.0|If you watched the special on NBC, you're gonna love the live DVD! It's got some songs not shown on TV and being able to watch Shania sing your favorite song over and over is a plus! Seeing Shania sing her new songs, interactive with the crowd and just being her great self make this DVD a must-have for all Shania Twain fans!
0688103111|4.0|I have traveled extensively and while I don't always agree with Bryson's analysis of an individual locale, I did enjoy this book.  An easy read, I was able to complete it on a flight and the return trip.  If you have visited Europe, this book will be more enjoyable to you, however, I question its value as a travel guide to the first time visitor.  I have not read any of Bryson's other travelogues, but I have put several on my Christmas list!
B0000DD7NL|5.0|After her amazing debut album, 'Songs in A Minor,' I was skeptical that Alicia Keys could follow up with something of the same caliber.  My doubts were quickly proven wrong, as upon the first listen of her new album 'The Diary of Alicia Keys,' it was clear that she had completely outdone herself.  Her rich vocals are as evocative as ever, and it is clear that her masterful fingers aren't only on the piano, but in every aspect of the album's creation, from writing to production. This isn't commercial R&B, but an album that showcases her classical training and the influence of true soul veterans.  'The Diary of Alicia Keys' is never boring -- each track has its own distinct flavor ranging from modern ballads like \\"Diary\\" to classic sounding soul like the album's first single, \\"You Don't Know My Name\\".  If you didn't know her name after 'Songs in A Minor,' there's no doubt you will after opening her 'Diary.'
B000002MUW|5.0|I love every song on this album the Queen couldn't go wrong on this cd. I totally love it and that's all I have to say. But my favorite track is track 6 Human Natural if anyone see the video they know that she wasn't playing. I love it and glad she put it out. God Lady M!
B0000DD7NL|5.0|I sat up last night and listened to this CD on AOL until I fell asleep. I woke up and went to go buy it and the dvd early! This album is THE BEST ALBUM OF THE WHOLE YEAR!!!!. Beyonce and Ashanti should be very scared because this cd is surpassing the both of theirs combined!! The production is innovative and refreshhing.The vocals are strong, soulful, and inspiring. If you thought Alicia Keys winning 5 grammys was overkill...this album proves she deserved 10!!! Soul Music is back!!
B0000DF3PN|5.0|CELINE DION creates an artistic goldmine with the help of the 4 talented male francophone lyricist (4 types = 4 styles).<br />On this release, CELINE relies artisticly on crafting a perfect song. Her vocal performance becomes the tool that polishes the texture of these songs. The lyrics of the tracks drown with sheer emotion. This is her best product (English or French) in a while. A perfect CD treat to relax &amp; take in with someone you're care for.
B0000DD7NL|5.0|I feel compelled to write this review partially to balance out the first review here. Alicia Keys's new album is gorgeous. If you are a fan of the soul/r&amp;b from the 60s and 70s, you will be very happy with these songs. The most striking thing is how much stronger Alicia's voice is now than on her first album. Most of the singers in her age group seem to have gotten weaker vocally, but not Alicia. Lyrically and musically, this album is light years ahead of Songs in A Minor (SIAM). SIAM was a good album, but the fact that she wrote parts of it when she was 14 are reflected in the music. &quot;Diary&quot; is full of gorgeous melodies, gorgeous vocals, and some killer instrumentation. Alicia should be very proud.
B00005QG9J|5.0|This is a another example of how great Incubus is, and has become.  They've evolved a lot since their first release, Fungus Amongus, but not in a step back, rather a few steps forward.  On their previous albums, they seemed to resemble The Chili Peppers combined with a jazz type genre, yet now they've  mixed into a catergory all their own.  The only dissapointing aspect of this CD was the lack of bass.  Dirk Lance (bass player) seems to be unmotiated and lacking.  At parts he works real well into the song, yet at other times he seems to be lost completely.  Dirk is definately not like the majority of bass players out there in the abyss of nu-metal and rock.  He always has stood out on past albums like S.C.I.E.N.C.E. and Fungus Amongus.  It's a major dissapointment to not see more of him here.  After buying this CD, you must check out Fungus Amongus, Enjoy Incubus, Incubus Attacks vol. 1 and S.C.I.E.N.C.E.<br />1. Nice To Know You - This is one of their three worst songs on the CD.  All three of their singles are slightly lacking in one way or another, but I still love all of them.  7/10<br />2. Circles - Great song, not as repetitive as the three singles from this CD.  Good guitar riff. 8/10<br />3. Wish You Were Here - Again, another good song, but still one of the three worst on the CD.  This could be because I've heard it soo many times.  7/10<br />4. Just A Phase - AWESOME song.  If you want to check out this CD, make SURE to listen to this song. Brandon's voice is great on this song.  It's extremely original and all of the instruments work together so well.  The instrumental in the first two and a half minutes of the song is awesome.  The ending is also really awesome.  This is a must listen.   11/10<br />5. 11am - Another great song.  Once again Brandon's vocals are incredible.  This song has a great soft touch to it, yet it is not boring or repetive at all.  All of the instruments compliment eachother real well.  10/10<br />6. Blood On The Ground - One of theloudest songs on the CD.  This is also really good.  Nice touch to the CD.  9/10<br />7. Mexico - One of my favorite Incubus songs ever.  This song has only an acoustic guitar, vocals and a violin.  It's extremely emotional and a great addition to the CD.  11/10<br />8. Warning - One of the three singles from the CD.  This one also seems slightly repetitive, but  it has a great message to it.  Nothing special about the instruments in this song, but it's still good.  Check out the video.  8/10<br />9. Echo - Awesome song.  This song flows really well.  The guitar is beautiful and Brandon's vocals are incredible.  The bass adds a nice touch as do the almost funk sounding drums.  Great love song.  10/10<br />10. Have You Ever - Another heavier song.  This song really does kick ass.  The bass and guitars work together to give a great heavy, catchy sound.  8/10<br />11. Are You In? - Dirk is awesome with the bass on this song.  I wish he did a bass solo, o well...  The drums are real funky and Brandon's vocals add and complete this song.  The guitars are nice, adding a great, laid back touch.  This is an awesome, original, slightly funky song.  10/10<br />12. Under My Umbrella - During the verse there is hardly any guitar at all, and teh bass takes over.  This adds so much to the song. Brandon's vocals kick ass, and keep the song moving real well.  Also one of the heavier songs on the album.  9/10<br />13. Aqueous Transmission - One of Incubus' most innovative and original songs ever.  Axtremely calming like in &quot;Are You In?&quot;, yet in a wole different way.  This song is liek nothing I';ve ever heard before.  It's complete with Japanese-influenced guitar, violin, cello, some sort of woodwind instrument, soft bass as well as soft dumming, and the occasional turntable.  This song is a masterpiece.  I've heard it live, and this displays some of Incubus' true talents.  11/10
B000002UB3|5.0|In my mind, this record, in concept, shape, flow, and plain old songwriting is the Beatles' best record, hands down.  I can name one or two weak moments on just about every other Beatles record (e.g., &quot;Within You and Without You&quot; on Pepper), but there's not one note out of place here.  Some of the shape is lost on CD, as the A side ended with the non-stop loop of &quot;She's so Heavy&quot; coming to an abrupt halt as it reached the end of the side.  Now it just segues into &quot;Here Comes the Sun.&quot;  Nevertheless, this record still remains one of the greatest of all time.  Great songwriting, great playing, and not overproduced.  A true testament to just how talented the Beatles really were.
B0000C7PSW|5.0|I am ashamed to say I had never heard of Rufus Wainwright until a month ago when a friend forced this overly cynical pseudo-hipster to sit down and listen to &quot;Want One.&quot;  I will never be able to thank her enough.  &quot;Want One&quot; is one of those rare works that changes the air in the room as it drifts out of your speakers.  So much raw, unbridled, utterly truthful and utterly un-sanctimonious emotion is unleashed in these songs, it's at times hard to take.  &quot;Go or Go Ahead,&quot; one of the most unbelievably beautiful pieces of music ever written, will rip the heart right out of your chest, especially if you've ever stood at one of life's crossroads.  And anyone with father-issues will be gulping back the tears during &quot;Dinner at Eight.&quot;  The first track, &quot;Oh What a World,&quot; is peculiar and utterly gorgeous, and is followed with the tragic, melancholy beauty of &quot;I Don't Know What it Is.&quot;  This album is truly a masterpiece.  The lyrics are nothing short of poetry, and the music itself, in the hands of Marius DeVries (who coached Madonna through her one and only stunner of an album, &quot;Ray of Light&quot;) provides a rich, layered canvas for Rufus to paint on. To quote Details Magazine: if there's more beautiful music being made, I haven't heard it.
B00005JMFI|4.0|Parents, you can feel safe letting your children of any age watch this wonderfully fun holiday movie. I was skeptical in thinking that it would be either too watered down for adults or too risque for children. It was perfect for the entire family! The subtle humour is perfectly portrayed by Will Farrell and the supporting cast only add to the ambiance, they do not detract! I can't wait for the DVD to come out as it will be added to my collection. Watch the movie, you'll be glad you did!
B00008S2VG|4.0|\\"American Life\\" has certainly been much maligned by the press, and its lack-luster sales figures have been repeated ad nauseum.  But \\"American Life\\" is by no means a bad album.  Rather, it is misunderstood.  Coming on the heels of the deeply introspective, ethereal, inner-peace monologue of \\"Ray of Light,\\" and the ambient, lush dreamscapes of \\"Music,\\" \\"American Life\\" seems a bit out of left field.  It is a mostly angry, defiant album, and its inspiration--disillusionment with the Hollywood machine--is a topic with which few are familiar.  We're not used to Madonna getting angry unless it's about the oppression of women or the suppression of sexuality.  And lately, since the advent of \\"Ray of Light,\\" we're used to very personal, poetic emotions being poured out over the digitized beats.  \\"American Life\\" does not follow this formula.  Madonna is, to put it plainly, bitching.  Bitching about fame and its encumbrances, bitching about the world and its dishonesty, bitching about the silliness of her past incarnations; and then peppering the complaints with lush confessions of what she's learned from it all, and the good things she's taken with her.  Musically, Madonna is the simplest she's been in years.  There are no layered sonic reveries here.  The sound is stripped, harsh, and to the point.  We're given guitar and a beat, and little more.  And truthfully, it's not a lot of fun.  There are no rollicking dance anthems, no tongue-in-cheek choruses, no throwaway lyrics.  But who said a Madonna album has to be a club-ready dance party?  Rather, \\"American Life\\" is insightful, unique, angry, political, and outspoken.  And overall the result is an album of fascinating, truthful, simple, and uncharacteristically pointed music.  Had it been made by a newcomer, everyone would be praising \\"American Life\\" for precisely what it is: a unique piece of work that is just short of flawless.

B0000CEB4V|5.0|Sure it's cliched to say, \\"His vibe was present\\" or \\"He was with us\\", with reference to tribute concerts. But with the Concert For George his presence, his voice, his magic, his spirit is almost palpable. Look back at the concert footage for Bangla Desh, George was probably within two or three years of son Dhani, who virtually glows onstage in the presence of Dad's bandmates and buddies. Any moment you can realize the gathering of Eric Clapton, Jeff Lynne, Billy Preston, Tom Petty, Joe Brown, Gary Brooker, Jim Capaldi and as Dhani says Uncle Ringo and Paul, you've got pure magic.<br />What an event and what more can be added, except to say this: Listening to the performance of All Things Must Pass, is the most wonerful and heartfelt expression I have ever seen among fellow musians. Then again, George was no ordinary musician, nor was he anything less than an extraordinary man.

I forgive him for providing me with formula characters and I forgive him for framing this book with some kind of hero, and I forgive him for writing what will become the Best Movie of 2005.<BR>The writing style gripped me, the pace of the story he was telling sped up and slowed down with the format and made my heart and mind race when necessary and gave me time to breathe at other times.<BR>I understand so much more about what addicts and their families have to contend with and I also forgive Frey for some sugar coating to make it a little more palatable.<BR>...and I cried a little.
B00005JMF6|2.0|Saturday night, I saw the movie _Gothika_. the acting was excellent, the direction OK, the plot lame....<br />as in: if the plot is too lame to build up viewer suspense naturally, it is not a good idea to insert B-movie creepy horror violins every time a character walks around. or sits down. or opens a door...<br />it's not like the concept is anything anyone hasn't seen on \\"In Search Of...\\" or  \\"Unexplained Mysteries\\" or a Chris Carter TV series. a decent screenwriter could have done a lot with it, especially with the caliber of acting talent they drew for this film. but no. the resolution was beyond trite, not that one would notice becuase one is too busy trying to resist the tension generated by the bad score.<br />I'll leave it to you, gentle readers, to deduce why on earth they called it Gothika.  I certainly couldn't figure it out.
0790736381|3.0|What the Amazon professional review is saying is eminently correct -- the film is derivative. Like &quot;Event Horizon&quot; that came out almost at the same time, the movie borrows its basic premise from the Russian &quot;Solaris,&quot; where a moral tale is told through supernatural phenomena enabled by the presence of a spaceship. The twist here is that the spaceship is 300 years old and lies on the bottom of the ocean.<br />Perhaps the ocean is a metaphor that represents our layered thinking and the &quot;sphere&quot; on the bottom of it is our deepest desires and the realization that we CAN make them real. The cast is indeed very talented and, along with special effects and a pricey set design, it rescues this movie from a total catastrophe. Our deepest emotions, our fantasies, our true nature are made of fear, suspicion, and violence. It's best to leave them repressed -- at the bottom of the ocean -- if we want to continue to live.
B000008HZB|5.0|... all that's decent in the world.  Of a completely different nature than the stuff most everyone who knows Jeff Lynne for (the music of Electric Light Orchestra), this obscure little masterpiece is definitely worth the long search it might take to find a copy (I had a difficult time tracking one down, but I see that there are several used copies available here at Amazon.  Bad news for me, but as I've had my copy for a while now that just means one more for some lucky soul who has yet to give this album a try).  It's a crime that this album wasn't a success in the USA when it was released (I understand that it did very well in England, but that wasn't enough to make it last... &quot;Armchair Theatre&quot; has been out of print for going on ten years now, and I think that's just awful).  <br />I found out about Jeff Lynne in a rather obscure way... two ways, in fact.  First off, when I was a wee lad of 11 my dad took my brother and me along with one of our cousins to see &quot;Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves&quot;, during the time of its original theatrical release.  If there's any one thing I recall leaving a definite impression on me, it was the musical score by Michael Kamen (who I should note passed away two weeks ago, at the time I write this review).  I bought the soundtrack as soon as it was released (on tape... I upgraded to CD many years later), and enjoyed it immensely... my first real introduction to orchestra music, it was (Disney's &quot;Fantasia&quot;, which I saw a couple years later, was my second.  The metal/Beatles revolution wasn't to occur in my life for another decade or so).  In addition to the instrumental music heard during the film, tacked on to the end of the album were a pair of &quot;regular&quot; songs... the one that everyone knows, &quot;Everything I Do blah blah blah&quot; (if ever there was an overplayed song...), and the one that &quot;**I**&quot; really liked, &quot;Wild Times&quot;, the final song on the album that no one to my knowledge even paid attention to, except for me.  <br />&quot;Wild Times&quot;, sung by some guy I'd never heard of named Jeff Lynne, really blew my young mind away and to this day, going on thirteen years later, remains one of my favorite songs (another one that, if I die anytime soon, I want to have played at my funeral, for those of you who have the power to make it so, should it unfortunately come to pass). It's really an enchanting, mysterious song, far far too short, and as the years passed I wanted to hear more from this Lynne fellow, whoever he was.  Searches for his name on Amazon and Ebay revealed nothing (this was before Amazon had a listing for out of print albums such as this).  I gave up on Lynne, pretty much forgetting even his name, though never the song.<br />In late 2001, following the death of George Harrison, through the miracle of a little service called Morpheus, my brother downloaded the music video to Harrison's 1980s tune &quot;Got My Mind Set on You&quot;.  Great song, if a bit repetitive, and a nifty video.  One guy I noticed thanks to his incredible head of curly hair and sunglasses really stuck out for me.  Intruiged by the hair, I wanted to find out more about this guy, and discovered his name was Jeff Lynne... but this was so far after I'd given up on searching for the singer of &quot;Wild Times&quot; that I didn't realize it was the same man, having forgotten his name!  I got into ELO a little while later, starting with the latest release (really more of Lynne solo album, but that's not important right now), &quot;Zoom&quot;, somehow not recognizing the voice who was singing!  One day, for reasons I cannot even remember now, I was looking at the liner notes to my copy of the Robin Hood soundtrack when I noticed the name Jeff Lynne as the composer/singer of &quot;Wild Times&quot;... talk about your surprises!  As Lynne had always been credited as Electric Light Orchestra at the time I was searching for him, I'd never been able to find anything under his actual name.<br />God bless you for reading all of that.<br />While &quot;Wild Times&quot; has never been equaled by any of the other music that Lynne has produced since (and from my limited really real ELO experience, restricted to just two albums, &quot;Face the Music&quot; and &quot;Time&quot;), the music you'll hear here on &quot;Armchair Theatre&quot; is still wonderful stuff.  Since I've been away at college I have't been able to listen to this album for several months (it's one of many I unfortunately left at home), but I've had several times since I left it a song from this album finding its way into my head and tormenting me because I can't actually hear it and satisfy the hunger.  Highlights for &quot;Armchair&quot; include the exotic vocals and mysterious piano playing on &quot;Now You're Gone&quot;, the melody and guitar playing on &quot;What Would it Take&quot;, and the Elvis Presley-inspired &quot;Don't Let Go&quot;.  Lynne's vocals are excellent (he has a very distinct sound, and I find it very funny I wasn't able to recognize him as the &quot;Wild Times&quot; guy for so long!), and it's nice to know that George Harrison himself was on hand to play guitar on several of the songs (less than half, I think, but still quite a few).  The album ends with the sweet, though rather sad enviromentally-minded tune &quot;Save Me Now&quot;, and a couple of little Easter eggs before finishing up.<br />&quot;Armchair&quot; sounds nothing like Electric Light Orchestra.  It's really got the sound of the Traveling Wilburys, which happened first before and then again after this album, which is great news if you like the Wilburys stuff (and I do).  As getting a hold of either or both of the two Wilburys albums can be rather expensive, if you want an idea of what they sound like and don't feel like forking over quite so much cash, just grab an inexpensive copy of &quot;Armchair&quot; and check it out.  If you want more, it can serve as a nice introduction,and it's good enough, you'll still have another solid album to keep in your music collection.<br />Carry on Carry on,<br />MN
B000060P79|5.0|this cd is awesome...it keeps me listening to it all the time.  it's not really very punk...sort of a punk pop.  if u like good charlotte this cd is gonna keep u listening.  the two bands are very different yet with a similar sort of sound.  all my friends love this cd.  it's upbeat and fun without being coated in sugar.
B0000C7GG2|3.0|Muse has been one of my favourite bands for quite some time, mostly because they are so different and energetic. I had a really positive feel for this album when i heared &quot;Stockholm Syndrome&quot; not long after the album was released and believed that if the rest of the album was this good and upbeat it might contest Origin of Symetry as their best album....<br />...however....i was shocked at the amount of really REALLY slow and depressing songs on the album!? Some of them remind me of backdrop music to a classic 50's musical! I didnt say the music is bad, im sure there are many of you who like this but im just a bit disappointed that there arent more songs like Stockholm Syndrome and hysteria on the album. Theres a lack of really catchy and epic songs like &quot;Plug In baby&quot; and &quot;New Born&quot;.<br />Overal its a fair album...i suppose Muse chose a slightly different route to their previous efforts and change is always good. I was just hoping for something more ROCK you know? More &quot;Muscle Museum&quot; or &quot;Deadstar&quot;....less depressing and emo.
B0000C9ZLD|4.0|the strokes have stayed on course on their sophomore effort &quot;room on fire.&quot;  Their short, catchy, guitar riffs still permeate this work and on some tracks sound better than ever.  &quot;Automatic stop&quot; shows a maturity in song craft evidenced by it's reggae feel and fine lyrics.  It could be the best track on this strong LP if it weren't for some other great songs such as &quot;The end has no end&quot; and &quot;between love and hate.&quot;  The former makes you want to crank up the volume every time.  This song, as with many other songs on the album, has lyrics that are hard to figure out.  It is a political song or a song about fear of going outside?  Maybe it's both.  The latter, &quot;between love and hate,&quot; has the bass alternating from bouncy on the chorus to rapid fire reggae  on the verses.  Also noteworthy is &quot;under control&quot; which is an ironic title considering the insouciant lyrics about a failed relationship.  The first single off the album &quot;12:51&quot; has a cool Cars-like guitar riff.  The video seems to be an homage to the 80's film &quot;Tron.&quot;  It's a beautifully rendered video.  I'd recommend this album to strokes fans and anyone who liked &quot;Is This It.&quot;  &quot;Room on Fire&quot; is a slight progression and a solid rock album.
0375751513|5.0|I was reading the graphic novel: Jaka's Story (Cerebus, volume 5) by Dave Sim and Gerhard (which I strongly recommend anyone to read, together with the sequence: Cerebus, volume 6, Melmoth) when I met the fictional character &quot;Oscar&quot;.<br />In that story, &quot;Oscar&quot; discussed with Jaka's husband, Rick, about a poisonous book (&quot;The Picture of Alfred Douglas&quot;), written by a certain Lord Henry Wotton! Any resemblance with the reality? :) &quot;Oscar&quot; told that he asked to Lord Henry how did he explain his success after saying that &quot;to be popular one must be mediocre&quot;? Lord Henry answered him that &quot;in this matter as in many others, he was the exception that proved the rule&quot;.<br />Reading these passages, I was charmed with the Oscar Wilde character and decided to read the true &quot;The Portrait of Dorian Gray&quot; written by the true Oscar Wilde.<br />I think the passages in Cerebus clarified to me what this book was about (modern graphic novels have the power to illuminate one's thoughts). One should not read this book looking for coherence. All the characters are incoherent, and this is one of the genial points in this book. People are not coherent, so fictional character must not be coherent either!<br />In the preface the author, himself, says that art is quite useless, though it is the thing he loves most to do! The artist Basil says initially that a picture, done with heart, belongs to the artist. Later, he gives the picture to Dorian Gray. Henry Wotton throws along all the story a series of poisonous thoughts  that he doesn't follow!<br />Other genial point is that Dorian, although being evil (and could be considered a villain in his own story) is not punished for what he does!<br />Sybil Vane commits suicide because of him, but nobody was able to connect her death with him. Later, he kills Basil, but he just disappears with the body, with no consequences. Near the end, when we think that he is going to be killed by Sybil Vane's brother, he escapes easily from him. Only when, by caprice, he makes the foolishness of trying to destroy his portrait, is that he finds death. That is, he dies merely by accident, not because of his vicious or crimes.<br />If, instead, he just tried to cut the picture he would learn that it would have the effect of hurting himself physically. Then he would guard the picture, and proceed living his life of eternal youth and beauty (that is, until some day some insects, or rats, or something, decided to eat his canvas... :) )<br />These are for me the mistakes of many writers, and what turns the end of many stories so boring and so unsatisfactory! The first one is that they want to produce a plot and tie all the characters of the story (as though it was necessary, and as though all characters deseverd to be well developed!!). The second is to try to create characters that evolve learning with their mistakes (as if everybody learned with their mistakes and stopped continuing doing them for all their lives!!!).<br />Borrowing the words of Lisa Simpson (in one of those funny, crazy, genial, Simpsons' stories), the moral of Dorian Grays story is that it has no moral!led by Sybil Vane's brother, he escapes easily from him.

B00005JMJ5|5.0|Ooooo! THE HUMAN STAIN offers the potential for so many Oscar nominations: Best Picture, Best Actor (Hopkins &amp; Kidman), Best Supporting Actor (Miller, Harris, &amp; Smith).<br />Hopkins is Coleman Silk, an aging and respected professor of literature at an idyllic New England liberal arts college, who, in the &quot;now&quot; of 1998, runs afoul of extremist political correctness. He's accused of racism after referring to two students, who've been absent from his class for the first 5 weeks of the term, as &quot;spooks&quot;, i.e. ghosts. Silk has never met them under any circumstances, but, as bad luck would have it, they're both Black. Called onto the carpet by the Board, and receiving no support from those who should know better, Coleman angrily resigns. When Silk breaks the news to his wife, she suffers a fatal heart attack. As Coleman puts it, his persecutors killed the wrong person.<br />On the rebound, Silk meets Faunia Farely (Kidman), who holds down three blue collar jobs, is separated from her abusive husband, a psychotic Vietnam vet named Lester (Ed Harris), and who keeps the ashes of her two dead kids under the bed. Faunia describes her troubled situation as befitting &quot;trailer trash&quot;, and carries more baggage than a loaded 747. But Silk is besotted, and embarks on a torrid love affair with the 30-year younger woman. As Silk declares to his writer friend Nathan (Gary Sinise):<br />&quot;This is not my first love, it's not my great love, but it's my last love&quot;. It's love - and great sex - in the winter of Coleman's life. Even Viagra gets a verbal plug.<br />THE HUMAN STAIN is also a tale of &quot;racial passing&quot;, i.e. the process  of shifting one's racial identity. You see, Coleman has a secret that he's kept buried for decades. (No, it's not that he's Welsh like Hopkins, but something else.) The film jumps back and forth between 1998 and the late 1940s, when a young Silk (Wentworth Miller) chooses to make the transition and abandon his natural family forever. It's only now, in a last orgasm of sharing with Faunia, that Coleman can unburden himself.<br />The plot sounds like grist for a maudlin TV soap, but is raised to heights of excellence by extraordinary performances, especially Hopkins and Kidman. Hopkins wore green contact lenses to match Miller's eye color, and the two men synchronized speech and body movement characteristics to make the age transition as seamless as possible. Nicole spent time in shelters for abused women to acclimatize herself to aspects of the role. And a scene where she longs to touch the back of Coleman's neck is Oscar material by itself.<br />Perhaps the most poignant sequence involves the young Coleman and his mother (Anna Deavere Smith), when the latter suggests what her birthday present might be five years hence. It brings tears to her son's eyes, and perhaps some of those in the audience. Smith's role is not extensive, but certainly memorable.<br />&quot;Human stain&quot; refers to the indelible mark, however miniscule in the universal scheme of things, that each of us makes on the world and which can't be undone.

B0000AXE8I|3.0|Okay, okay, it ISN'T the worst film ever, as some here have claimed; it's just that the first Matrix set the bar so very high as a smart, stylish, action-filled sci-fi knockout.  And Reloaded doesn't come close to the first, because it breaks very little new ground.  The visual look is identical to the first, with the exception of the Zion scenes.  Plotwise there's not much new--Neo has a quest, but we're hardly clear on what he expects to find or why he should believe anything at all that he's told in the world of the Matrix, or why he even thinks he should believe anything he's told.  He certainly knows that the world is a fiction--that's what makes him the One!  There is an interesting twist at the end that I won't reveal--it's all that really makes the film worth watching for those of you interested in the storyline.  The writers dropped the ball almost completely on Agent Smith and the Oracle--it seems to me that what actually happened to Smith, what he has now become, outside the program, is of real interest and much more compelling than seeing him split ad infinitum; and the true nature of the Oracle is hinted at but not really explored.  Of course, some questions must remain unanswered for the final film, and I hope these are addressed.  There's a very peculiar scene in a restaurant, and a bit with a keymaker, that disturb the continuity--I felt that the scenes were there to provide some weirdness, but make very little sense in the context of the Matrix itself.<br />So that leaves the action.  I should probably leave it to others to judge this, not being a connoiseur of fight scenes--I always get irritated that Hollywood seems to think that outrunning machine gun fire is so easy and often-accomplished (at least in the Matrix there's really a context for it!).  But in general, I thought much of the action was simply tiring.  Okay, Agent Smith multiplies, Neo fights him to a draw, Neo flies away.  I get the point.  But do I need to get it for so long, so often?  There were admittedly some great moments, but some very long half-hours, as has been said of Richard Wagner's operas...<br />I'll definitely see the end of the trilogy; but Reloaded has completely changed my expectations.

B00006BTCA|4.0|We'll start off with the blatantly obvious--this band's ripping off Joy Division to no end--but besides that, they've also created some seriously stirring music that lacks a peer in today's video-driven music industry.<br />At times you'll hear Slowdive, The Smiths, The Jesus And Mary Chain, New Order, Depeche Mode, etc.  I think the point's been made that this isn't an original band, but at least the conviction is there.  Besides which, they've got great taste in rip-offs.<br />They may be silly and ignorant, but they've got guts, and guts is enough.
0385504209|5.0|If you never read the 1982 book HOLY BLOOD HOLY GRAIL (Baigent,Leigh,&amp; Lincoln, New York:Delacorte Press), you might think that Dan Brown came up with some interesting 'facts' from the historical record.  However if you do two things, read the 1982 book and do an internet search for &quot;Priory of Sion&quot; (use Google), you will come up with the material from which to craft the story of the DaVinci Code.  And it's crafted from some very clever flights of fancy.  But the reader should be prepared to face the question: which is closer to fiction -- Dan Brown's THE DA VINCI CODE or the claim that Jesus Christ rose from the dead?
B00000AFHM|5.0|I love If You're Feeling Sinister more than words can explain, but I think The Boy With The Arab Strap might have it beat, in my book anyway. Yes, Stuar Murdoch lets some of the other B&amp;S folks handle a few of the tracks, and yes, Stuart is unquestionably the strongest songwriter. But in all fairness, the tunes from Isobel Campbell and Steve Jackson offer a nice little bit of variety, and Jackson offers one of the album's best tunes, a clever song about lost love entitled &quot;Seymour Stein&quot; (this is the track used in the film High Fidelity). Elsewhere, Stuart Murdoch offers more of his fantastically twisted, sardonic, and beautiful tunes, such as the lush opener &quot;It Could Have Been A Brilliant Career,&quot; &quot;Ease Your Feet In The Sea,&quot; the addictive and upbeat title track, and the subdued epic of a closer, &quot;The Rollercoaster Ride.&quot; &quot;A Spaceboy Dream&quot; is arguably a throwaway, but it really doesn't bog down the album in any way; the sequencing seems just right, as to not clutter the non-Murdoch compositions together. The Boy With The Arab Strap is another B&amp;S album that seems to come from another time or an alternate universe, one where light, airy 60's folk-pop is based on intelligent, dark, and clever wordplay. Say what you want about this not following through on Belle &amp; Sebastian's promise. It's my personal fav.
0671449028|4.0|This is a great Boyton book though it's second to some of her classic ones.  I think the story/wording is one of the best but the last few pages do not have any animals on them.  Appropriate for the story but my little ones love these books for the goofy pictures so the mundane pics on the last pages are a bit of a let down for them.  I would still recommend it though.
B000002LK1|5.0|What can I say besides WOW.  I bought this album a couple of years ago because the singles, like &quot;Personal Jesus&quot; and &quot;Enjoy The Silence&quot; kept getting stuck in my head as I was trying to get through my otherwise mundane day.  I certainly don't regret it because DM is one of my favorite bands now.  <br />This is one of those rare records where there is no low point--everything is excellent.  It also has, to an extent, a universal appeal.  No matter what your &quot;scene&quot; is, you will find enjoyment and perfection in this record.  It is, to this moment, the best DM record ever made.  I can only hope that Martin, Dave, and Andy can exceed their own standard one day.
0761119752|5.0|This is the reigning Boyton book in our house.  Catchy phrases and Boyton's usual adorable pics do not disappoint.  My two boys STILL giggle at the \\"ugly pajama\\" page.  Also great for little ones for learning some colors, textures, old vs. new, etc.  A must for your little Boyton lover.
B000002LCI|4.0|This really is music for the masses.  Although the title was intended to be tounge-in-cheek, it's on the mark.  If you've seen the film '101,' you know what I'm talking about.  This is the dark and moody Depeche Mode that fans know and love--a study in gothic synth pop at its ultimate best.<br />The great thing, first of all, about this record is that the singles do not define it.  Certainly, &quot;Strangelove,&quot; &quot;Behind the Wheel,&quot; and &quot;Never Let Me Down Again&quot; are wonderful songs.  However, if that is what what the listener is looking for, why not just skip buying the record and pick up the Singles 86 &gt; 98 set?  Buy this record for the non-singles, like &quot;The Things You Said&quot; (a real gem, sung by Martin Gore), &quot;Nothing,&quot; &quot;Pimpf,&quot; and &quot;To Have and To Hold (Spanish taster).&quot;  &quot;Little 15,&quot; which was a single in France (but not elsewhere, for some reason), is another gem.<br />Like any album, there are low points.  They exist, however, within the so-called &quot;bonus material.&quot;  While Depeche Mode's remixes tend to be right up there in quality with Nine Inch Nails', this group is rather dissapointing.  As I mentioned before, the &quot;To Have and To Hold (Spanish taster)&quot; mix is worthwhile; however, don't waste your time listening to anything else, unless you're throwing a rave soon.<br />To conclude, it doesn't really get much better than this (other Depeche Mode releases, i.e. Violator, excluded).  It is experimental, dark, and yet truely Music For The Masses.
0767836324|4.0|Simply wonderful, great cast, great story and magical visuals. Robin Williams is Peter Pan all grown up, but his forgotten past returns when his children are kidnapped by Captain Hook, a fantastic performance by Dustin Hoffman. Other cast members include: Julia Roberts as tinkerbell, Maggy Smith as the now aged Wendy, Bob Hoskins as Smee and look out for the early film appearance of Gwyneth Paltrow as young Wendy.<BR>Although the film does have some fairly dark undertones that some parents might feal unsuitable for very young children, it is an extremely enjoyable experiance for the young and the young at heart and you'll want to watch it again and again.
B0000AUHPB|3.0|This is one of my favorite movies from my childhood, which I saw once on television in Italy and never could find it again.  I looked forward to finally owning a copy and ordered it months before it was available.  When I received my DVD I was very disappointed.  The color fades in and out for most of the movie, not a little, but drastically.  The sound is a little off, but not that bad.  I don't know if it is just my copy, or all copies, but if you order this great movie, make sure you save the return information in case it is a faulty.  I didn't.
B000060P79|1.0|Every time I hear simple plan it makes me want to vomit.  They have to be the worst band ever.  Their songs are stupid and sound just like every other pop-punk band.  Not original at all.  Overall this album is a -100,000.   DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS GARBAGE!
B0000DYJM6|5.0|Everything changes, that's not new. Even music, and that's not new neither. And i'm very happy that PJ have not kept the same after 12 long years, for they have grown in a very solid and mature band. They had to face various changes in their history. Ups and downs, changes in the band formation, their music changed, their lyrics changed. Back to the start, everything changed. But they still have an incredible leader voice, two amazing guitarrists, a magnificent bass player, and all the drummers that have played in PJ have been wonderful. Maybe some albums are better than others, but still, Pearl Jam is, today, the best rock n' roll band in the world. No f**cking doubt about it. And i've still haven't seen them live. I'm from Uruguay, South America, and i doubt i ever see them unless they march on to Argentina where i'll make myself some time and escape to our neighbour country and vibrate with, i repeat, the best band in the world. Then i will die a happy young man. Amen.
0060207051|5.0|Our first copy fell into tatters.  Our second copy is on its way out.  Our third copy waits for us at Grandma and Grandpa's to ensure we never make the horrible mistake of forgetting our copy at home.  What more need be said?  We have been reading this book to our 26 month old almost since birth.  He's gone through chewing on it to pointing to it to now requesting it by name before going to bed.  It's the perfect length for a good night book for little kids.  There are just the right number of words per page so the pages turn quickly. The cadence and repetition is soothing, the colors pleasing.  And for more stimulating play, you can always ask them to spot the mouse in each panel (though be forewarned, we once had to play find the mouse a dozen times in a row).  There's no \\"message\\" or \\"lesson\\" and no, \\"years of scientific research into reading habits and patterns\\" did not go into this book--it's just a lovely quiet simple book that children love to listen to.
B000089RVR|5.0|She's great.......again. This CD is one of the best I have. I really like it, specialy &quot;Don't leave home&quot;, &quot;Mary's in india&quot;, &quot;Closer(Hidden track)&quot;, &quot;Life for rent&quot;. I only don't really like &quot;Stoned&quot;. It's as good as &quot;No angel&quot;!
B0000CEB4V|5.0|I accidently bought this dvd thinking it was a soundtrack.  It turned out to be one of the best produced and directed concerts I have ever seen on video.  A gathering of talent with heartfelt playing, no ego stuff here.  Dhani Harrison is a spitting image of his Dad, eerily so!  While My Guitar Gently Weeps and My Sweet Lord at the end, were especially moving. Clapton was awesome, as was Billy Preston doing those two titles.  I have watched this video many times and it still sounds sweet.  Until all of his music was put together like this, played by all his friends, I did not realize how truly gifted George Harrison was with both his lyrics and music.  A great item to own. Oh Yeah, on top of everything, this concert  includes the infamous I'M A LUMBERJACK by Monty Python, It just doesn't get any better than this.
0141301155|4.0|Andrew Schilli<BR>December 1, 2003<br />Charlie and the Chocolate Factory<BR>By: Roald Dahl <BR>ISBN 0-14-130115-5<br /> If you owned a huge, big, giant factory what would you do?  The plot or story takes place were a boy Charlie Bucket and his family is poor.  They can barley make and when this famous Chocolate Factory owner Mr. Willie Wonka tells the nation about his contest.  If you get the golden ticket in a Wonka bar you will be able to see the famous Wonka factory.  Then tons of kids and adults look for these tickets.  One by one the tickets disappear then the last ticket is none other than Charlie Bucket.  Now he has a chance to save his family from hunger. <BR> The book was very good as a kid I read it and enjoyed it very much.  So I checked it back out to read the book I loved before.  I very much recommend this book to a child for a holiday or just as a gift.  Any kids to read to at night or for fun.  Children from five to 10 would love it.  This book was not boring at all it was filled with action and comedy.<BR>There were pages that were great and left you in suspense, for example in the begging of the book there are kids finding the golden ticket and you never know whom, how, or what there names are!
B0000E1WNV|4.0|we recieved this dvd yesterday from the great people at amazon.with everything of bruces we always can`t wait to watch it,but we were really dissappointed with the sound quality.whoever produced this dvd has really let bruce and the e street band down.live in new york will still stay our favourite.
B00009V7RF|1.0|What happend to Black Eyed Peas? This is a pop album not hip hop.This is not good. Sorry but it isn't. If you want to buy a <BR>Black eyed peas album then buy Behind the Front. That's album<BR>rocks.
B00005JLWN|4.0|Out of the 100+ minutes of Equilibrium, there are maybe 10 minutes worth of Gun-Kata action sequences, which is more than enough for me to rent and love this movie as one of the best gun-fight scenes of all time (a list I will soon create to include Matrix, Desperado, Way of the Gun, Black Hawk Down).  The premise of this movie, a totalitarian dystopia devoid of emotions, is nothing special even to the most casual of sci-fi fans.  Orwell has been there, Huxley has done that, and Bradbury said it before.  The acting is adequate, which is more than you can ask for out of an uninspired and stereotypical plot.  <br />BUT isn¡¦t Equilibrium an action movie?  Isn¡¦t an action movie¡¦s plot, however unbelievable and unoriginal, there to serve only as a backdrop for the actions?  Which brings me back to the only redeeming quality of Equilibrium.  Gun-Kata is a form of martial art focusing on the use of handguns (kata refers to the set, almost ritualistic movements in martial arts to be repeated by students).  The movements are mathematically calculated, factoring in the position and distance of the targets, the trajectory of the bullets and the physical recoil to flow from one motion to the next in order to maximize killing potential.  The CGI sequences used to explain the principles of Gun-Kata is absolutely brilliant and should be implemented in high school geometry classes.  The idea of mathematically analyzed martial art is mind-blowing (at least for me); and its execution on screen, coupled with Equilibrium¡¦s relentless electronica soundtrack, will rip your cornea and give the most ardent adrenaline junkies multiple cardiac arrests.
B0000E1WKE|5.0|Oh Holy Night...OH my LORD!!<br />This CD is definatley one of Whitney's best! Her voice is so amazing...she is a great talent. It is too bad that the news media and haters have to say bad things about her but her voice proves them all wrong...well done Whitney!!!! :)
B00009TB5G|5.0|My husband and I really enjoyed this version. I'm a big fan of the books and I was a little disappointed in the orignal theater version of the two towers because most of my favorite parts of the book were cut for fights scenes that aren't even in the book (after thirty some reading in my lifetime I can't find the battle with the wargs in any book or appendix). I preferred the character development and internal struggle of the characters and Peter Jackson seems to like big battle sequences. Almost all of the missing stuff was put back in. The battle at Helms Deep is more in proportion with it's importance in the book instead of the main focus of the movie.<br />Now some of the new stuff is great and some is choppy. The Huorns are put back in, but are done in such an awkward way that they were better left out. On the other hand, all the extra Faramir stuff added a depth to the character that made him more consistent with the book, and as a result the lines he says have a lot more background and meaning. Fans of the Ents will be pleased. Still, I admit after watching both versions, I can see why Jackson made the decisions he did. <br />The theater version is probably the smoother, more easily understood version for those who aren't familiar with the background story. It isn't necessary to know the individual orcs' names to understand the story. You may also not like the length of this version if you aren't dedicated. I watched it over two nights, splitting it at the disc change, to make it less of a marathon. <br />If you're a fan of the books, or a new fan of the movies looking for something that fleshes out the story more, you will love this.
B00005JMEW|5.0|Quentin Tarantino does not fail to amaze. How, oh how, does this film geek achieve such spectacular perfection on the silver screens? How can this blabbermouth, who can't stop showing off his extensive film knowledge, keep realizing his visions so beautifully on the screen? There have been quite a few influential auteurs/directors whose stylistic trends influenced generations of filmmaking; to my opinion, Tarantino \\"the high school drop-out/video store clerk\\" has already positioned himself amongst the classics. 'Reservoir Dogs', as a debut shot for less than $2 mil., are you kidding me? 'Pulp Fiction' has instantly achieved cult status, and I'm not going to delve into how nuanced and examplary this motion picture is...'Jackie Brown' remains the best Elmore Leonard adaptation, where Q.T. displayed his mature side, successfully keeping the audiences' attentions glued due to the intricacies of the plot. And now, after a mysterious 4-year disappearance which spawned off endless rumors as to Q.T.'s whereabouts (one of the rumors involved the director, depressed, smoking pot and watching B-movies this whole time), the man delivers again. \\"Kill Bill\\" (\\"Q.T.'s 4th movie\\", as it's advertised - once again proof of the director's amazing substantiation in the highest rank of auteurs) is a representation of Tarantino's love for filmmaking - this film is ALL about style, and nothing but, and it does not dissapoint.<BR> Uma Thurman had her successful roles before (\\"Pulp Fiction\\", \\"Gattaca\\", \\"Hysterical Blindness\\", \\"Tape\\"), but this is clearly her finest hour yet - the film belongs to her, for she blends in perfectly with its flabbergasting energy, style and wit. Just like the movie, her character never comes off as funny, but rather as an extremely determined individual, sometimes to extreme measures.<BR> Yet the film is all extreme measures. Uma Thurman's Bride's existence was viciously shattered at her wedding, when her organization turns against her. She is shot, but stays alive to find Bill, and kill off her enemies in the process.<BR> Without revealing too much, that was the plot. How else to make it work but to incorporate it into a surreal anime/B-movie/Japanese homage bloody mess of a film, where the protagonist, along with all of her opponents, except Bill and future rivals in Vol. 2, are sexy young women who love to fight? Qunetin Tarantino's infatuation with filmmaking is evident from shot one, and you will know what I mean when you see it. As with 'Pulp Fiction', I am hesitant to delve into thorough discussion of all the subtleties that Taranitno inserts into \\"Kill Bill\\" without lessening the viewing interest of the reader.<BR> Constantly changing visual styles - from the aforementioned anime to grainy realism to black-and-white to a fairy snowiness of a backyard - each set is almost like a level that the protagonist has to pass, but what levels, and how she does it is portrayed unconventionally. Take the sequence where The Bride fights off dozens of samurai. With a custom-made Sonny Chiba sword, she majestically flies over them, as blood sprays in typically excessive amounts. <BR> Though it's all basically Quentin Tarantino's huge homage to either the numerous directors he loves or his own adoration for their work, \\"Kill Bill\\" astounds, and the main reason for that, apart from the relentless action, style and protagonist, is the fact that this film geek once again tops himself, despite the enormously high expectations after his three masterworks.<br />P.S. Some argue Miramax's decision to cut the orginal four-and-a-bit hour version in half is unfortunate. I, personally, disagree - people saw Vol.1, there was mad gossip about how great it was, and now the anticipation of Vol. 2 is borderline unbearable.
B0000BXGCN|4.0|There is not much to comment on Lara's performance--simply the best. Not to mentioned the great performance of Pierre's piano and the string quartet. The live production was a 5 stars one. I would have given the CD the same 5 stars rating if it was splited into two CDs and included all songs performed in the concert. Though you can find almost all in the DVD except &quot;Pas Sans Toi&quot;, my favorite. Anyway, it brought back all the good memories since that night I left the Olympia Hall. Lara's fans will pick up this CD without a doubt, especially those who could not make it to the concerts. For those who never heard Lara's voice, or just listened to her English album only, you won't regret to try this singer-songer-writer's passionate perforamnce in French. Don't understand French, no problem. Her voice will touch your heart and you can feel the lyrics. I only know the word &quot;Je t'aime&quot; :-)<br />In fact I couldn't help but bought the CD &amp; DVD from amazon.fr when it was released in October. Finally it came to Canada at a reasonable price. Good news to Lara's fans in Canada. Let's hope its region 1 version DVD will be released soon. Most fans may like the editing of last live concert DVD more--to see Lara and the audiences interaction rather than the fade out transition between each songs. The stage lighting condition was not good for the camera too, created some washout scenes. The bonus clips of &quot;Bambina&quot; and &quot;Tu es mon autre&quot; is a plus, but again, too bad &quot;Pas Sans Toi&quot; is missing.<br />Wish someday Lara would include Vancouver, BC in her concert tour. Are there any fans out there?
B0000DJZ9T|4.0|Definately try and rent this one before buying.  It is amazing, but its not like being there.  Its more like watching a music video.  Its rough, quick cuts, and doesnt give you a sense of the size of the crowd, stage, setup, etc...  You don't feel like youre there.  <br />Besides that, its incredible.  Nice extras and great menus.  These guys are the real deal.  Check it out!
B00005JKC3|1.0|this movie made no sense, I am a huge fan of the comic, and this movie to me just seems like a big advertising ploy.<br />And the cgi isn't very good, the hulk looks incredibley fake. I don't understand how the people who do the cgi could think that the hulk looked even remotely realistic. He looks like a big slab of clay.
B00003CXZ4|4.0|An unusual look at the loss of identity. Christopher Nolan pieces together the shattered life of Leonard Shelby, very effectively conveying the sense of schizophrenia.  The scenes dovetail a little too neatly, which wouldn't necessarily be the case with schizophrenics, but this is aimed more at allowing the viewer to reassemble the movie.  Guy Pearce puts in another fine performance, capturing the manic edge of the protagonist as he struggles to solve the vexing riddle of his identity.  The movie is more about style than substance.  The story itself is rather simple, but Nolan's sharp editing makes it a movie to remember.
B0000B1OFL|4.0|This movie started out great, but it seems to me that the movie, climaxed up to a certain point and then just fizzled out. The ending to me was really disappointing, i feel that the &quot;good&quot; guys didn't get the direct vengeance they deserved, and the movie just ended abruptly. <br />ALso, the cut scenes from the movie were hilarious, i dont understand why they cut them; he says, &quot;time contraints&quot; yeah right thats a bunch of bs, the movie is short to begin with. The scenes he cut, were great, and would have added extra laughs, and the whole part with that one guy driving was taken out. <br />Movie all in all was good, but it just left me wanting more; i ended up watching all the extra features and still found myself unsatified enough that i went out and rented another movie.
B00005QGAZ|5.0|When I was four years old, I went to my first concert. It was Michael Jackson. ( I think it was  for the BAD album.)Ever since then, I have loved Michael Jackson. I am SO DELIGHTED that I persuaded my aunt to buy this CD for me. (I finally got it the day after Thanksgiving.) Every song sounds just as good as the day it came out but my favorite is &quot;Human Nature&quot;. &quot; The Girl is Mine (with Paul McCartney)&quot;, &quot;Lady in My Life&quot; and &quot; Wanna Be Starting Something&quot; are also songs that I highly enjoy.<br />I really can't see how someone couldn't find their jewel on this album.
0156907399|4.0|Take my word for it--if you've not read Virginia Woolf before--you need to be in the mood to read her.  I think her books can be unbearable otherwise.  However, I was in the mood for &quot;To the Lighthouse,&quot; and I thought it was terrific.<br />I've been much more intrigued by Virginia Woolf after Michael Cunningham's &quot;The Hours,&quot; (and the subsequent film) brought her back into the limelight.  She was fascinated with the degree to which everyday, seemingly trivial details of life can seem to be matters upon which the state of the world hinge in the lives of those experiencing them.  Therefore, in Virginia Woolf's world, the decision as to whether or not a vacationing family will visit a lighthouse on the following day becomes the focus of everyone's thoughts--to a little boy, it seems as if his world will end if he doesn't get to go; to the father, his ability to determine whether or not they will go gives him a sense of power and authority over his wife and children.<br />And at the center of all this non-drama is Mrs. Ramsay, wife and mother, who is the foundation upon which the family is built.  Woolf is expert in communicating the influence Mrs. Ramsay has on those around her.  Everyone is struck by her beauty, her bearing, her very existence.  It's this quality in her that makes so many wives and mothers the center of their respective families, which gives &quot;To the Lighthouse&quot; a sort of universality that resonated very strongly with me.<br />There has been a lot of literary study on the psychology of the novel (especially Freudian), which has become somewhat less interesting as Freud has become commonplace.  I would instead appreciate it for the utter mastery of language exhibited by Woolf, and the insights she has into male/female relationships.<br />&quot;To the Lighthouse&quot; is one of those books that left me feeling incredibly sad in a very satisfied way, and I can't even tell you why.  I don't always enjoy such ethereal writing (I don't even enjoy other books by Woolf) but in this case I enjoyed every word.
B0000AXE8I|3.0|The Matrix Relaoded was a major disappointment when compared with the original. I loved the Matrix and  I have probably watched it about 30 times. This sequal isn't bad but it is just nowhere near the quality of the original. In spite of this, it was still an  exciting movie experience. There are some incredible action sequences and the layered plot is still interesting but it does begins to wear a little thin. There is a rave scene in Zion that seems especially transparent and superficial.  It does not fit with the rest of the film or anything from the original. If you really enjoyed the first movie this is a good purchase, otherwise it's just another action movie.
B00005JM02|4.0|&quot;Finding Nemo&quot; has given more importance to emotions than other aspects of movie. The story is simple but the colors are stunning and the imagination is extra-ordinary. <br />The movie is quite funny and lot of information for the kids too. The characters chosen are perfect - best example is Dory. It is true that the movie is for all ages - In fact I saw more elders in the theatre enjoying than the kids.<br />Somehow I liked &quot;The Lion King&quot; more than this for the animation, story, music and grandeur. May be it was the first few animated movies I watched and so it could be the reason.<br />Overall, a good entertainer.
B0000CABBW|5.0|I was hesitant to watch Whale Rider. Usually films others rave about get a 'so-so' reaction from me. But I really loved Whale Rider. This is a classic tale that will appeal to young and old. Whale Rider is the story of a young Maori girl (Pai) who must overcome the difficulties faced between herself and an aging grandfather who insists that being a warrior is not a suitable occupation for a young girl, and indeed, that this is taboo.<br />The granddaughter must overcome her hurt and her grandfather's old-fashioned customs to prove to him that she's the best person for the job. (And save a few whales in the process.).<br />Overall, an excellent film filmed in New Zealand.
B000060MMI|5.0|More Irish punk! Love this band. An absolute must have! Love this band love this CD. Good punk, and very humorous. I can't see why you don't already have this, and I am insulted that you actually have to read a review for this, just buy the freaking thing!!! ok this band is sooooo sweet! at first i just bought the cd, enen thogh i had never heard the band, i put it in and was like SWEET!!! they are like a irish punk bad with fiddles and banjos. FLOGGING MOLLY IS AMAZING! Wow, this cd is incredible. This is even better than Swagger! On this cd Molly does more electric guitar than on Swagger and the songs are amazing. Some of the best songs are &quot;Rebels of the Sacred Heart&quot; &amp; &quot;Swagger.&quot; Buy this! Get it yet, BUY THIS!!!!
B00005QHPQ|2.0|What people are saying about this CD is true because it is a very good cd. When I bought this cd I thought it [was bad] but when I got it I said wow this a good CD. I have being a fan of Enrique Iglesias since 1997.For me has a black man it real hard me tell people that I like Enrique...
B000003RCY|4.0|I'm a big Rammstein fan; I have all three of their CDs, the &quot;Live Aus Berlin&quot; DVD, and I've also been known to buy soundtracks to get my hands on exclusive Rammstein tracks (I picked up the &quot;Resident Evil&quot; soundtrack just to get my hands on &quot;Hallelujah.&quot;)  <br />Of their three CDs, Herzeleid is by far the most angry and intense.  It's not going to appeal to all musical taste; if you want some of their more thought-provoking work, &quot;Mutter&quot; is your best bet.  &quot;Herzeleid&quot; is designed to go straight for the throat.<br />This music is designed to illicit a response; whenever I go for a run, I load up &quot;Asche Zu Asche&quot;, &quot;Laichzeit&quot; and &quot;Du Reischt so Gut&quot; into my MP3 player.  It's somewhat monotonous, but the beat is constant, and the band sounds angry enough to get anybody's heart beating faster.<br />Be warned, though, Rammstein's lyrics aren't going to appeal to a lot of people.  &quot;Laichzeit,&quot; for example, means &quot;Spawning Time.&quot;  I'll let you use your imagination from there on out.<br />Still, &quot;Herzeleid&quot; is among the best death metal on the market today.  If you're new to Rammstein, though, I suggest picking up their second album, &quot;Sehnsucht,&quot; first, which was their first album released in the US and has the hit &quot;Du Hast&quot; on it.
0151008116|1.0|After reading so many positive reviews of this book, I went right out and purchased it. It was a mistake.  I kept thinking there had to be some redeeming quality. After reading about a goat being given in sacrifice to a large predator to teach children a lesson, a zebra with a broken leg being eaten alive from the inside out and a detailed description of collecting and eating tiger feces by Pi, I think the author should take up another line of work and the people who gave it the Man Brooker Prize should be fired.
B00005JLEU|4.0|&quot;Spirited Away&quot; stars a young Japanese girl named Chihiro who finds herself in a magical dimension where the lines between friend and foe aren't so clear.<br />The movie is expertly animated, featuring some of the best animation I've ever seen.  The musical score, likewise, is perfectly suited to the film.<br />The storyline is deep and mysterious, with rich characters being realistically fleshed out and described in detail.  There's a wide cast of them, too, ranging from the wraith-like &quot;No-face&quot; to the ugly frog-men.  The only reason that I've dinged it a star is because the ending is a little too pat for my taste.  Everything seems just a little too convenient for the film's conclusion, but hey, this is a children's movie.<br />Keep in mind, though, that &quot;Spirited Away&quot; won't be for all children; there is one scene with some blood in it (in fact, the amount of blood took me by surprise--hence, the movie got a PG rating instead of G.)  Other than this one scene, though, perfect for all family members.
B0000DD7LB|3.0|Once again U.S. consumers are ripped off. The European/U.K. versions have two songs not included on the U.S. album.<BR>Other than that, this is fun, trashy music. It's unfortunate that girls like Britney seem to equate maturity with whoredom.

0192833553|5.0|The Bennet family has five unmarried daughters and when Charles Bingley, a rich bachelor, arrives at nearby Netherfield, Mrs. Bennet sets her sights on him as a prize catch. At a ball at Meryton everyone agrees they like the openhearted Mr. Bingley, who has developed an affection for the Bennet's oldest daughter, Jane, but they find his friend Fitzwilliam Darcy to be an arrogant and disdainful fellow. For their part, Mr. Darcy and Bingley's sisters are repelled by the Bennet's lower status and the embarrassing Mrs. Bennet. At the ball, Elizabeth Bennet, the second oldest daughter, overhears Darcy the man say she is not handsome enough to prove a temptation to him. However, when Jane becomes ill on a visit to Netherfield, Lizzy arrives to nurse her sister. Mr. Darcy is impressed with her lively mind, but cannot see himself falling in love with someone from a poorer family.<br />The Bennet's estate at Longbourn is entailed to Mr. Collins, a clergyman who is Mr. Bennet's nearest male relative. In search of a bride, Collins arrives to consider the Bennet daughters while prattling on about his patron, Lady Catherine de Bourgh. Meanwhile, Elizabeth becomes infatuated with George Wickham, a handsome and charming militia officer, who has apparently suffered great personal wrong at the hands of Mr. Darcy. Elizabeth now considers Darcy to be not only proud, but cruel, and she is only to happy to have her own prejudice against him confirmed by Wickham. Bingley is removed to London, where his sisters and Darcy can keep him away from a heartbroken Jane and when Elizabeth refuses Mr. Collins's proposal of marriage, he is accepted by Charlotte Lucas, Elizabeth's best friend, who sees it as a calculated move of social advancement. Even more shocking, Elizabeth receives a second proposal from Mr. Darcy, who speaks disdainfully of her family and ruefully admits he has been unable to conquer his imprudent affection for her. Of course, Elizabeth rejects this insulting proposal as well. But then she begins to learns things that call Wickham's character into serious question, and have her rethinking her low opinion of Mr. Darcy.<br />&quot;Pride and Prejudice&quot; is probably the most popular of Jane Austen's novels, with its emphasis on character and her comic look at the human condition where considerations of class are ultimately no match for true love and a temperant meeting of similar minds. Certainly we can point to more important novels in the history of Western Literature, but we would be hard pressed to find as important a novelist as Jane Austen, with her rejection of the tenets of Romanticism. Whereas the romantics celebrated the power of emotions, Austen's work embodies a strong belief in rational thinking, which finds no better embodiment than in the character of Elizabeth Bennet.  The selection of this as the one Jane Austen novel to read if for some silly reason you decide only to read one in your entire life would be justified on that character more than the plot line.But then she begins to learns things that call Wickham's character into serious question, and have her rethinking her low opinion of Mr. Darcy.<br />&quot;Pride and Prejudice&quot; is probably the most popular of Jane Austen's novels, with its emphasis on character and her comic look at the human condition where considerations of class are ultimately no match for true love and a temperant meeting of similar minds.

B000002TQV|5.0|Simply because the first couple of listens it sounded like a 'de-evolutionized' version of OK Computer. I couldn't have been more wrong. Just like every other Radiohead album (minus Pablo Honey) this one requires your attention.<br />The Bends contains some of Radiohead's finest work, including Fake Plastic Trees and the epic Street Spirit. This is beautiful stuff.
B00000K3CM|3.0|There are some differences between the plots of &quot;Home Alone&quot; and &quot;Home Along 2: Lost in New York.&quot;  Instead of going to his family going to France for Christmas they are going for Florida, instead of the family leaving them behind Kevin (Macaulay Culkin) gets on the wrong plane, instead of an old guy next door he befriends an old lady in the park, and instead of taking place in a Chicago suburban home it takes place mainly in a swank New York hotel.  Of course, all these changes are ultimately immaterial because John Hughes is sticking close to the original formula for his smash 1990 release for this 1992 sequel, even if Chris Columbus gets the joy of directing.<br />The same three elements that worked so successfully with the original are present again.  First, Kevin gets to enjoy the highlife without his parents, enjoying the power of his father's credit card.  Second, Kevin once again gets to take down the Wet Bandits (Joe Pesci and Daniel Stern), when their paths get crossed again.  Third, there are the poignant moments with the kindly older folk that Kevin runs into, and his mother (Catharine O'Hara) has a lot more to do this time around in her frantic efforts to get to New York and look for her son.  However, the fun is a little less enjoyable, the creative attacks on the goofy bandits seem less comic and more painful, and the heartstring have already been plucked and sound more hollow in this sequel.  If you are young enough to be happy that everything is just as you expect and do not mind the formula being followed right down the line, then you will find &quot;Home Alone 2&quot; more palatable.  But in the rating book of life, more of the same is less and not more.
0060934913|1.0|I WANTED to like this book.  It was our book club selection... I was hosting the book club meeting...and I always read the monthly books.  Somehow, this book put me in a bad mood, especially during the holidays, and its foul language and distasteful stories didn't fit with my family, holiday spirit. Instead, I stuck with &quot;Good in Bed&quot;, &quot;Clara&quot;, and &quot;Master of the Senate&quot;.
0385504209|5.0|This book  was very entertaining to me. Nice to have a thought-provoking and a well-researched book to read. I see there are a lot of one-star reviews that are pushing down the overall rating of this book? Why?  Is this book too smart for you? Couldn't break the code yourselves? What a shame. For those who have read the book, if you go to Dan Brown's website he has the actual paintings that are referenced in his book. Definitely worth checking out.
B0000029DD|5.0|Jeff Buckley has THE most heavenly voice I've ever heard.  His work is musically sophisticated with excellent lyrics, and yet accessible to everyone.  Just the thought of his voice sends chills up my spine.  I've never heard anyone spill about their personal pain so poignantly or with such 'grace.'  Simply divine.  <br />You must hear this!!
B00005JMFR|5.0|This was an excellent movie with very few flaws. It is a great ending for a series that otherwise would not have made sense. Matrix and Reloaded were excellent too, yet in different ways. Matrix opened up the philosophy of what the story was about while Reloaded focused mainly on visual appeal to the audience. Revolutions was a great finish to a great series. It's just too bad that Neo gets his butt kicked (unlike the first two parts).
B0000DD7LB|4.0|I used to be a Britney-hater.  But after listening to this album, I decided that its not her voice (or lack thereof) that makes it a decent record, but the delivery as a whole.  Sound effects, lyrics, tempo, and rhythm all blend together to make a great album.  Sure, its not as innocent as her earlier albums, but being the same age as Brit, I know what its like to grow up A LOT over the past few years, and I think she expresses herself very well in this album without the need for much talent.
B0000DIXRU|5.0|Anathema is just growing and growing so much each record they put out. The music just improves so much with each release. All the songs are great in my opinion, and i wouldn't change anything about them. <br />The other people that reviewed this cd are complaning that Anathema have left the metal genre. But couldn't they see it coming when A Fine Day to Exit came out? There were only 2 out of the 9 songs on that cd that I could call \\"metal\\", and besides, Anathema is so much better then guitars, bass, drums. They have the ability to use other instruments to make their songs more unique sounding and interesting. Such as the beautiful synth on Are You There, or the vocal sound they do on Closer. Anathema is more then just a metal band. Just like Raidohead, they have left their \\"Creep\\" days behind them, and have never sounded better.<br />Ratings:<BR>1. Harmonium 5/5. Great lyrics, heavy sounding riff at the end.<BR>2. Balance 4/5. good music<BR>3. Closer 5/5 Anathema's next classic. Cool music and cool vocal sound and good lyrics.<BR>4. Are You There? 5/5 one of my favorite Anathema songs ever<BR>5. Childhood Dream 4/5 great instrumental, very atmospheric<BR>6. Pulled Under... 5/5 most metal song since Judgement, great song that tells you Anathema haven't lost all the metal in them.<BR>7. A Natural Disaster 5/5 I never was really into female vocals but I love this song. My 3rd favorite.<BR>8. Flying 5/5 my favorite song on the cd. I love it!!!!<BR>9. Electricity 5/5 sounds a little like coldplay i think... my 2nd favorite on the cd. great lyrics and piano<BR>10. Violence- the piano starts it off, then the heavy guitars blow you away.
B00000J7SO|5.0|Street Legal is a great album.  An emotional odyssey starting from confusion and bitterness (Changing of the Guards and New Pony) through introspection, understanding and regret and culminating with one of his all-time greatest songs Where Are You Tonight? The band and back-up singers give the songs great atmosphere and a great sound.  Don't believe the crap you hear from people who don't appreciate this album, it's one of his best.

B00006CXSS|5.0|I would just like to say this series was the greatest portrayal of WWII ever. And to Ian Cooper, What do you know about war? People like you make me sick. You talk about war like you've actually been in one. I'd like just five minutes with you alone so i could give you a savage beating, you are dishonoring all the men who fought and died so that you could have freedom. You take your freedom for granted, you should be deported.
0613624688|5.0|(I recomend reading Sabriel first, but it isn't required) Lirael, Daughter of the Clayr is a great book for those interested in books involving magic and evil. Garth Nix has created a world with ongoing possibilities and a source of magic called the Charter. Lirael is one of those characters with the required corage, strength, and wit to save the destruction of her world, the Old Kingdom and Ancelstierre. If you have been interested in books such as The Lord of the Rings, or His Dark Materials series, you will definately like this book along with Sabriel and Lirael's sequel, Abhorsen. (Don't be discouraged by my mentioning of \\"saving the world\\".) I garantee you'll love this book. If you don't read it, you'll be missing out on a great adventure!
0385508417|5.0|Skipping Christmas is a wonderfully invigorating little tale from Grisham - and most people who think differently seem to be missing the point. They seem to be expecting serious literature, either that or they are Grisham fans disappointed because this is not a legal thriller and is nothing like one. Of course its not! This claims to be nothing, not literature, not a legal thriller. And just because this is a departure from Grisham's style does not mean it is a bad book in any way. Because it is not what you're expecting does not merit a negative review. The preconceieved notions that people come to before they begin a book can spoil it entirely for them...<br />This is, basically, the story of a couple who, their daughter having gone away to do chairty work in Peru, decide to give themselves a break; to skip Christmas for this year, save the money and go on a small cruise instead. However, they've not bargained for the attitudes of their neighbours...<br />This is a lovely little story, wonderfully crafted, simply but well-told in Grisham's normal ludicrously-easy-to-digest prose. It shouldn't take you much more than a couple sittings, short as it is.<br />It may not be literature, but it does actually really make you think. Some of Grisham's observations are slightly facile, but that doesn't mean they aren't valid or true. Indeed, they are the same observations most people make every single day to one another. This develops into quite a complex tale, actually. It takes on kindness, community spirit, diverging from the pack, and, of course, the commerciality of Christmas and, in the end, reveals a simple yet warm heart. It's got a little suspense, too, in the &quot;Will they or won't they make their cruise?&quot; aspects of the story.<br />This is a lovely little read, ideal for the run-up-to Christmas. Ideal for anyone. Anyone at all. Amusing and entertaining, people with sympathetic characters, it should serve as the perfect relaxation for anyone who wants to take a little break from all the bustle of Christmas preparation! Read it, and judge it entirely as what it is: a good little story to at least make you reconsider some of the routines of Christmas.ake a little break from all the bustle of Christmas preparation!

B00008PW2D|5.0|Um, excuse me, we are supposed to be reviewing the product itself, not how much it costs!!! I am a HUGE fan of the show, and I think that Season 5 was one of the best. A short season doesn't have to equal a bad season. It seems that many of you are confusing quality with quantity. Shame on you! <BR>I heartily recommend this product to everyone. It is worth the money!!!
0780020685|5.0|Seven, is the number of perfection, the gathering of particular men to convey resistance and strength against a band of Thieves, entering the weak and frightened hearts of the villagers, to hopefully physically refuse the attack of the marauders, the Samurai Seven are towards some 40 of the attackers, so; Can it be done? You'll have to watch it my friend to know the result of such a strange Bet. Master film director Akira Kurosawa, takes you into a complete human journey of despair, friendship, blood, and strategy, all set in the warming hearts of the protagonist, a whole micro-cell of emotions and deeds, the human comedy at its splendor, sad, tragic, humorous, and violent, Art imitating Life. Proclaimed as one of the best films ever made (which it is), Seven Samurai is one climax of human logic and emotions in the fields of battle, little can it be done to expose more feelings and savagery in every day against the inevitable tragedy of existence, and little can be offered to show more happiness when all its said. Kurosawa composes with extreme artistry of the image how a bunch of men can give hope in times of weakness, at the same time entering the dominions of complexity about War stratagem in killing fields. Sounds exiting? <BR>The film approaches the philosophical side within every man and woman, it clears the human need for social gathering, man alone can't survive, and so its better to fall united than kill with a lonely hand. Kurosawa magnifies this issues and presents them inside an intense military organization for the sake of survival, tactics, planning, eye for opportunity, and prediction of the enemy thinking, this is the very weapon in War Stratagem, organization, targeting, and accurate killing, one by one, until it is over, then you can rest, and so Kambei (perfectly performed by Takashi Shimura) carefully organizes both the resistance and the attack, every part moves because of his masterful strategy. <BR>Kurosawa shows the truth about this social Class, taking away all Myths and deformations of the true Samurai, instead he delivers the real struggles and perils of such an unusual profession, the protagonist are nothing more than lonely men, skilled but miserable, without any real future, some of them are in for the Glory, others, for the thrill and excitement, in this case, they are in for the food, only one stands for the need of a Master's acceptance, the youngest is in for the experience. Don't expect to see highly choreograph battle scenes, here, the raw and almost absurd violence is shown in its real state, the intention is reality, Samurai reality, a perfect script. <BR>Released in 1954, the film lasted a complete year of shooting, Kurosawa pushed the producers for every resource he need to achieve his vision. Fortunately for him and us, the film was the biggest box-office success of that year in Japan, the result, a cinematic Masterpiece, crowned in 1979 by a group of high talented and respected Japanese artistic professionals, as the Best Japanese Picture ever made. <BR>The movie contains some of the best frame compositions filmed in Cinema History, along with a dynamic development of every main character in the film, the final Canvas pushes for every emotion, situation and motion poetry ever to be cast in one single movie, plus it features the partnership of two of the greatest film giants, Kurosawa (Akira), and Toshiro Mifune as the merriest Kikuchiyo. Mifune portraits with musical perfection, a man lost in his personality, in deep search of meaning and commitment, it may seems like overacting, but is the character who is overacting his emotions, like a child in a adult body, a landmark performance. The beautiful musical themes and tempos gives the final touches to this fine piece. <BR>The DVD edition (by The Criterion Collection), offers a good transferring of the movie, but its quality is not at the level of the film, scratches and dust can be seen in several of the scenes, although the ulterior visual aspects are good, a much better work could have been accomplished. The edition contains an excellent simultaneous audio commentary track by Japanese film historian, Michael Jeck, featuring deep aspects and thoughts about the making of the film, with biography of its protagonist (cast and crew), along with anecdotes surrounding this mythical production. <BR>A must for viewers, Seven Samurai, is a cinematic reference, one of the highest peaks of the Seventh Art, and a cultural mirror of long gone men, now irrelevant but indispensable in Japanese and worldwide cultures.
B00009V7T2|5.0|This album is among the best of the best of the rockandroll style albums made ever. It has the hard songs and the soft songs for you to enjoy. The pictures are obscure but beneficial, like the words that they are purported to represent. The time is now for you to become an accomplice in the music of THE MARS VOLTA today!
B00005JMFR|4.0|Well this being my first foray into the world of reviewing, I apologize for my inexperience ahead of time.  I hope that as I continue to review Movies/Books/DVD's and all other medium, that you will enjoy my comtemporary views towards all things entertainment.  I will also promise to be brief and with my reviews...as I only read the reviews that do not dilly dally but get to the point..........The Matrix Revolutions along with Matirx Reloaded, it's predecessor, are one big great movie.  Yes Reloaded and Revolutions are nothing more than a very long movie.  I know that most of you have read the other 335 reviews so I wont go into as much detail as I normally would...so i will get to my inner voice early..  The whole trilogy is a conglomorate of:  The Bible, The Dune Series, and many more other books(told you i was brief).  Original this film is not.  SO dont try to make this into something it isnt.  It is the story of the messianic choice...to sacrifice ones self for the greater good of human kind.  It all comes down to choice.  The oracle is not omnipresciant.  She only offers the path and Neo must \\"choose\\" which path to travel.  As this is the total underlying theme to the movie (and if you know the theme) you will enjoy the film.  But!!! If you are looking for closure and resolution to the film then you might want to look elsewhere.  This film ends with the filmakers giving the audience a choice.  You must choose what you got out of the film.
6305897786|4.0|This is the movie &quot;The Ninth Gate&quot; It stars stars like Johnny Depp and Lena Olin in it. There is a guy in it who is trying to raise the devil with a book. His name is like natalie imbruglia, but different. The movie is long and a little of those things that are making you say &quot;hmmmmm&quot; are suer to be found here too. Thank You
B0000AUHPG|5.0|This is an excellent movie!  The best of all &quot;spaghetti&quot; western.  I've never thought of Henry Fonda as attractive but in this film there is a basic animal attractiveness about him.  The scenery is as much of a tangible character as the actors, all of whom are exceptional in this film. The way that the shadowy figure is introduced and reappears with growing clarity increases ones need to understand... and then once you do there are no words.  Last but not least, the musical score is awe inspiring, playful, and emotional.  I can only say see this film, and then see it again. This film is truly a classic.
B0000E1WKE|2.0|Whitney Houston fans have waited nearly 20 years for the diva to drop a Christmas CD. But we all could have waited a little while longer if the extra time would have resulted in a better album.<br />&quot;One Wish&quot; is devoid of soul and is grossly over-sung, even by Houston's standards. Our girl bends one note into ten at every opportunity; her take on &quot;Have Yourself A Merry Little Christmas&quot; is the most egregious example of vocal showboating I've heard in quite some time. (The tender, restrained &quot;Who Would Imagine A King&quot; is practically the only exception.)  To make matters worse, the bland, R&amp;B-lite arrangements featured here make Houston's over-the-top vocals even more jarring.  Not until the CD's final track, an electrifying, gospel-tinged version of &quot;Joy To The World,&quot; do things really click.  Here, the Georgia Mass Choir lifts Houston out of her funk and keeps her focused.  It is the only truly thrilling song you will hear on this CD.<br />The most depressing thing about &quot;One Wish,&quot; though, is that Whitney Houston's voice is failing. Years of belting out one song after another, along with whatever extracurricular activities Houston is alleged to have engaged in recently, have clearly taken a toll on the singer's voice.  High notes that were once strong and clear are now forced and ragged, and there are times on this CD that Houston literally sounds out of breath.  She's even upstaged by daughter Bobbi Kristina Brown, who is positively adorable on the first verse of &quot;Little Drummer Boy.&quot;  But then Mommy comes in with the vocal grandstanding and the &quot;Oooh yeahs,&quot; and what could have been the highlight of the album is ruined.<br />If you're buying this as &quot;the new Whitney Houston album,&quot; then you probably won't be disappointed.  But if all you're looking for is a good contemporary Christmas CD to use as background music for your holiday party, you will want to avoid &quot;One Wish.&quot;  It's just too loud and screechy.  Sadly, this is borderline incompetence from the preeminent R&amp;B vocalist of our generation.
B0000AXE8I|4.0|Complain, complain, complain. That is all I hear from people about how this second instalment of the matrix is not as good as the first one. I cannot help but feel that many people out there have not understood the movie and, perhaps, the whole idea behind this trilogy. If you are a computer programmer you should be able to connect with the overall concept of virtual reality and computer coding, and this movie really shows, mostly in a graphical and easier to grasp, a deep relation between the two. I personally think that this movie was just as good or actually better than the first one not because the SFX are improved, but because the plot and complexity of it is exploited in a more multilayered way and Trinity is just as HOT as ever. There are a few things that I just don't care for, for example; they all, mostly, wear sunglasses even in low light ambients and the overall dialogue is somewhat woody and filled with over the top words and sentencing that makes things sound more complicated than they should. Also, when Neo fights hundreds of agent Smiths in the courtyard, the switch from live actors to CGI characters is noticeable and makes it feel like you are watching a videogame rather than a movie. Other than that I really like this film and the message that it tries to convey. Overall: VERY GOOD.
0156027321|5.0|I read at least 3 books a week and while some would question how that impacts the rest of my life, I can respond with an amazing experience like this book. It is the best book I have read thus far this year. I usually find that I cannot submerge fully into the story, but after the first 50 pages or so, I am not sure I came up for air. The ending was a delight. <br />Clever, articulate, and thought-provoking... ...this book had everything. The beginning was a bit slow, until the author establishes where you are going, but he really unleashes the story and his talent thereafter. I gave it to my sister and my mom after I was done. Fabulous! <br />Also, this book would make a great gift - if you are a non-reader and are afraid that a book may offend - there is nothing of that nature here, just a great story.
B000031EGV|4.0|What a great movie and a clever concept!  A board game that sucks you into it, and must be finished by the originals who played the game.  I remember seeing Jumanji in the movie theatre when it first came out, and this past weekend had the opportunity to rewatch it (thank you resale DVDs!)<br />Starring Robin Williams and Bonnie Hunt, the action is fast paced and easy to follow.  No swearing in this movie makes it appropriate for all ages, though little ones might be frightened by the rampaging animals.  There is nothing Disneylike in their qualities.<br />Still, the story of sticking together and teamwork prevail throughout the entire film.  Bebe Neuwirth and David Alan Greier are great in their supporting roles.  Bonnie Hunt gets some of the best lines in the film with regards to cheating and a downtown sale.  An early Kirstin Dunst is also great.<br />If you have never seen Jumanji, I encourage you check it out.  It's fun and you always wonder what the game is going to come up with next.
B000002J1O|5.0|As a younger fan of classic rock n' roll, I played this album for the first time only a couple of years ago. I entered into it with a little reluctance, because I generally thought of Genesis as the Phil Collins-led pop group that released all kinds of trash in the '80's. But, boy oh boy, is this album ever different from anything they released in the post-Gabriel era. It is by far and away one of the best albums I've ever heard -- a true gem of progressive and classic rock history. As a lover of music, I can only describe this album as incredible. It is perhaps nearly as good as Dark Side of the Moon. Do yourself a favour and buy Selling England by the Pound as soon as you can.
B0000TB050|5.0|If you're a U2 fan and after reading all these reviews you haven't gotten the DVD, stop right now and get it! Seriously, watching a U2 show in front of their hometown fans forces them to raise the bar, and they deliver! This one reminded me of why I got into U2 in the first place - watching &quot;Under a Blood Red Sky&quot;. Same intensity, but obviously captures them much farther along in their now historical career.<br />True, it is mostly the Elevation Tour, but each song is delivered with noticeably more emotion - throw in the sad death of Bono's father and, to steal the phrase its easy to get, 'stuck in a moment'. Unlike the other concerts, rather than showcase new songs, this one only has 5 tunes (all of which made it to radio) from the latest project and brings back &quot;New Years Day&quot;, &quot;All I Want Is You&quot;, and even better &quot;Out of Control&quot; (Bono even alludes to their parents funding them $500 lbs to get a record deal). We're talking high energy from start to finish. Plus, the special feature of &quot;Making the Unforgettable Fire&quot; gives a very cool insight into the making and editing of &quot;Pride&quot;. True mainstay live tunes &quot;The Fly&quot;, &quot;I Will Follow&quot;, and &quot;Bad&quot; would have made this complete, but hey, 20 (including Mysterious Ways) out of 23 aint bad. Beside, include those and why do you need the Elevation DVD? <br />Heck, if nothing else, you get to see someone dump a beer on Bono. That's worth the $$$ isn't it?<br />If you only buy one live performance from U2, this one is a no-brainer.
B00005Y6YB|1.0|Just a note for the viewer in Minneapolis...the original miniseries was EIGHT hours long, not six...any edited version of such a classic, especially when 25% has been cut, is bound to be disappointing...
B0000E1WNV|4.0|Has anyone ever been letdown by &quot;The Boss&quot;? The man continues to amaze with his tireless gutsy performances that can go from quieting 60,000 people to raising the roof in seconds. I loved &quot;The Rising&quot; top to bottom and couldn't wait to see it live, especially after being blown away by the NY DVD that featured many 'b-sides' that rock.  <br />I almost felt out of line feeling like something was missing, until I read Scottgootman's comments that were right on. Bruce is on the top of his game. The production is missing the quality that was there with the NY DVD. <br />Any Bruce fan will enjoy this, but the sound isn't nearly as crisp as the NY DVD. Great crowd reaction, plus some rare tunes make it worth the $$$.
B0000028PL|5.0|I recently dusted this CD off when I was sifting through an old box off CDs. I have to say STAIN holds up even after 10 years. (WOW has it really been that long?!) The songs are darker and more aggressive then on their previous 2 releases. I think it paved the way for some of the aggressive bands we here today like Sevendust, Snot etc.. Unboubtedly the bands tightest recording. Living Color went out with a major bang with this last CD. It would be nice if they had a reunion tour!!
B0000DD7NL|5.0|Alicia was ropped of alblum of the year last time with songs in a minor. But 2 years later she has came back with the best album of 2003 FOR SURE!! This CD shows her unique style and she's able to combine various styles of music and it's wonderful. I will listen to this CD hundreds of times just like I did with her first and maybe more. The DVD that comes along with it is cool too. This is a must have not just for Alicia Keys fans, but music fans in general.
0553277472|5.0|I write only to defend a gifted author's brilliant work of philosophy.  I stopped by this page to check the reviews, and was horrified to find so much negative feeling.  My argument, obnoxious as it might sound, is that all the gripes others have with this book are rooted in their fundamental misunderstandings of the text.<BR> This book is a work of popular philosophy, which explores previously uncharted territory somewhere between Mysticism and dialectical engaging of truth.  It deals with an overview of Western though in this area, and proposes its own unique theses.  I have changed the way I live my life based upon the sage advice of this novel.<BR> As far as I can see it, one of the main criticisms of the novel is that it starts off well, with a compelling problem, and what seems to be an innovative solution to it, but pans out to be an  intellectual cop-out.  This is not the case.  The Amazon.com review declares, \\"His solution to a synthesis of the rational and creative by elevating Quality to a metaphysical level simply repeats the mistakes of the premodern philosophers.\\"  Which premodern philosophers would those be?  I believe that Mr. Bruya means \\"pre-socratic\\" not \\"pre-modern,\\" but even this criticism is invalid.  Pirsig acknowledges that he owes an intellectual debt to the Sophists of ancient Greece, but his ideas far surpass theirs.  Rationality, as it exists today, did not exist at the time of the Sophists, therefore he must necessarily expand beyond the scope of their understanding of philosophy to maintain his relevance to the modern day, which he certainly does, through many specific modern examples.<BR> Mr. Bruya continues to argue that, \\"the narrator's claims to originality turn out to be overstated, his reasoning questionable, and his understanding of the history of Western thought sketchy.\\"  Sure, Mr. Pirsig had intellectual precursors, such as the Sophists, the 20th century pragmatists (William James, etc...), and others, but I challenge anyone reading this to come up with someone who has prefigured Quality.  Secondly, his \\"reasoning\\" is \\"questionable\\":  give me one example of faulty logic in the book!  Pirsig, though he rejects the supremacy of dialectic, is still a master-dialectician, and his logical entrenchments are flawless.  Finally, his understanding of Western though is most certainly top-drawer.  Yes, it is incomplete, because the majority of Western though does not speak to his point, but that which he does cover is correct.  I challenge anyone to come up with an incorrect point he makes about that which he does cover.  As a student of philosophy, Mr. Pirsig's command is entirely correct, in my understanding of things.<BR> I also challenge whatever Mr. \\"Rampageous Cuss\\" has to say, as I feel that his command of the book, and the ideas therein, is incomplete and juvenile.  He states, \\"It's neither well structured nor well written, and its philosophical insights are more deeply felt than deeply thought.\\"  The writing is extremely fine, and if Mr. Cuss was not engaged by it, it speaks to his short attention span, not the author's skill.  He does not use flowery, empty rhetoric, his writing is immediate and to-the-point, reminiscent of other American greats, such as Thoreau, or Stephen Crane.  The structure of the book is extremely complex, and Mr. Cuss' comment on it simply belies his faulty understanding of it.  There are, in fact, three separate characters in the book: Phaedrus, the narrator of the novel, and then Robert Pirsig the writer himself.  That the narrator seems to contradict his own philosophy is not a flaw in the writing, it is a carefully structured didactic narrative, in which the contradictions are meant to point out the ultimate philosophy of the book.  The narrator of the book is not meant to be a morally immaculate character.  He is merely a character meant to express a point.<BR> Mr. Cuss then says, \\"Unhappily he decides he was a misunderstood genius, names his pre-breakdown self 'Phaedrus' and rambles into a tendentious complaint about academia as he relates his earlier life.\\"  Robert Pirsig was a misunderstood genius.  What part of this book could be classified as \\"rambling\\" is beyond me.  Mr. Pirsig seems sincere and intelligent in every stage of his discourse, and, like all of the other negative reviewers, Mr. Cuss has failed to cite any specific examples of this \\"rambling\\" making himself effectively immune to criticism.  His complains about academia are well-supported with specific evidence of his empirical experience in academia.  His arguments are all logical and correct.<BR> Finally Mr. Cuss makes the grandly fallacious assertion that, \\"as the narrator he is pompous and self obsessed, struggling with a massive inferiority complex. He is given to sweeping pronunciamentos and overblown metaphors.\\"  The narrator of the book is meant as a teaching tool, in the same way Plato used the Sophists in his dialogues as advocates of bad ideas to reenforce his overall good ideas.  The narrator is meant to seem pretentious and self-contradictory.  His terrible relationship with Chris is proof of this.  He finishes his speeches on caring about human rapport, and then treats his son horribly.  He is a character, meant to illuminate the message of the novel, nothing more.  I would also argue that not only are there no \\"overblown\\" metaphors, but that the language is largely non-metaphorical.  Pirsig rejects metaphors as a means of understanding, as Plato used them (the Horse and Chariot analogy of the soul comes to mind).  If Mr. Cuss is referring to the vague descriptions of Quality, as \\"overblown metaphors,\\" he needs to understand that Quality cannot be subordinated to language, and there is only the realm of analogue to clarify it.<BR> Overall, this is the second best book I have ever read, and I assure you all that if you read and take the time to understand this book, you too will love it.  It is a sublime journey to the high country of the mind, and you will not be sorry.
0385504209|1.0|I did not like the Da Vinci Code. In fact, after the first 150 pages I felt manipulated and insulted as a reader showing faith in the author's good intentions. Along with its poor writing style, lack of essential argument, forced plot development, flat dialogue, absence of character development, and the lukewarm, impressively non-intelligent ending, the book manipulates the reader into believing that the author's references to history, art, geography and religion are facts and not his subjective interpretation or \\"poetic license\\" for the purpose of writing a mediocre novel. The inaccuracies are too many to count but the author makes no effort to remind the reader that his facts are, in fact, fiction. Instead, he provides a page titled \\"Fact\\" at the very beginning of the book as a priori confirmation that the ensuing narrative contains facts. This is dangerous for the uninformed readers. The author seems to use the same method on his readers that he accuses the church of having applied for centuries on the gullible folk to control and extort their faith, loyalty and money.

This is one looser of movie, it so sad not because of the tragic end of the vessel, because this is so boring, the ...

B00008PW2D|2.0|Reviewing a DVD means reviewing all of its product details: the quality, the content, the PRICE included. With \\"price\\" mentioned, let me just say that this is one expensive DVD set for what you're getting. Had the fifth season been 18 episodes like all of its predecessing seasons, then dropping 50 dollars for this package would be as simple as before. But you can count 'em right here: 8 episodes. Logically, you would expect that since we barely got 1/2 of a regular season we should only pay for about 1/2 of the regular season DVD price but apparently, that's not how the tides turned. Understandably, capitalistic interests got in the way of this negotiation but c'mon, the fifth season wasn't even that good to begin with! To SATC fans looking to purchase this DVD, don't think I am trying to discourage your buy (it's your money!) but just remember to weigh in all the details of a product; particularly the price of this one.
B00005JKC3|4.0|Being a comic book fan, I try to get to see a number of the comic-to-film adaptations that get made and was some concerned about The Hulk.  The Superbowl ad didn't inspire confidence with its &quot;first glimpse&quot; of the Jolly Green Giant's cranky little brother.  Of course, the effects weren't done yet, and when I finally got to see the movie in question I was greatly pleased, much moreso than the highly disappointing Daredevil.<br />That said, a warning.  The Hulk is not your typical action movie.  Director Ang Lee is very interested in giving his characters soul and personality moreso than thrills and explosions.  There are those, but the movie has a slow, quiet pace that it works along with.  Character is more important for Lee than fight scenes.  And his characters are, by and large, emotionally stunted.  Scientist Bruce Banner bottles everything up.  It's only the Hulk in him that can express emotions, and does so to an extreme level.  His father, David, is a raving lunatic.  Girlfriend Betty lets overbearing men cower her at times and her father can't see past his career for dealing with anybody.<br />Lee's sense of scope is at times beautiful.  The natural scenes of the desert add texture.  These are the wide expanses that a creature like the Hulk could easily roam.  Also, Lee's attempts at stimulating comic book panels for the most part works for me, with one noteworthy exception (and if you see the movie, you'll know which one I mean).<br />My only complaint, besides the bad panel stimulation involving the death of a major character and the occassional gaps in logic, was the kid gloves approach to violence that sometimes is employed.  While the Hulk is seen breaking all sorts of equipment and military vehicles, hardly anyone on hand seems to get seriously hurt.  Granted, the Hulk is the &quot;good guy&quot; and the soldiers on duty aren't evil, but given what the monster is (a creature of rage and low intelligence) and what he's doing (breaking anything he can get his hands on), it seems odd that no one seems to be getting seriously hurt for the most part, if not killed.<br />Just remember if you sit down for this:  it's not just a superhero action film.  The Hulk is trying for something more.
B000066NW0|1.0|If i could i would rate this CD a 0 but since i cant itll get a 1. Ok, Avril Lavigne's music is flat, the lyrics are incredly dull, and lack a deeper meaning. Other bands and groups posses introperspective and reflective lyrics. Instead of Avril I would recommend: Ramones, Sex Pistols, The Clash, Buzzcocks, NoFx, Dropkick Murphys, Sublime, Reel Big Fish. If you're not into the harder 70s punk, OAR, Butch Walker, The Flaming Lips, and The Smiths are good choices. If you insist on sticking with pop at least pick some pop with class. Ryan Cabrera posses tolerable lyrics and very good guitar playing.   C'mon..Honestly, would you listen to a song called Sk8ter Boi??
B00008PW2D|1.0|The price on this set, even with the amazon discount, is simply absurd and an insult to the fans of this series.  The episodes themselves are not bad whatsoever; in fact this season had some excellent moments, but there is no reason why it should have been released at any rate above $30.00.  Like all the reviewers below, I will not be getting this season even if it causes my collection to be incomplete.
0783113943|5.0|I must say, that this has got to be one of the best tear-jerkers I have ever seen.  Angelina Jolie gives an awesome performance as &quot;Gia&quot;, no holds barred.  Elizabeth Mitchell, as Linda, gives an honest performance, showing just how much a person can love and care for another, and make a difference.  The whole story is tragic.  Still, I couldn't help but come to love the leading characters.
0385504209|1.0|Leonardo Da Vinci hated  the Church and anything to do  with  Christianity.  The reason being that he lived an immoral  life and hated any institution that could condemn his immorality.  Da Vinci tried to  discredit Christianity by portraying a contorted gospel in his art. The Last Supper he portrays as a marriage super of Jesus and Mary Magdalene, being one of many misinterpretations of scripture in his art.<br />Da Vinci's view of Christianity is pure blasphemy, yet Dan Brown gives him credibility as a commentator on Christ.
B0000CD5I6|4.0|This album/CD is a great blend of new Tull Christmas songs, older Tull songs with a Christmas theme, and traditional Chistmas tunes re-aranged by Ian Anderson.<br />I'm getting copies for my brothers.  This is the type of album that may be played but one month a year - so I'm hurrying to get this out to my siblings.  Although it may be played 8.5% of the year, it will be played for that 8.5% throughout the rest of our lives.<br />Thank you Ian for this precious gift!<br />Don
B0000DD7LB|3.0|For a commercial success like Britney Spears, it's not hard for her to summon the hippest and hottest producers/song writers to work on her album. And 'In The Zone' is a decent pop album with some great hooks. The problem here is, what happens when all of the hooks and hot beats are taken away? Unlike Christina Aguilera, she doesn't have a strong enough voice to rise above the songs. Britney moans and whisper through more than half the tracks here and it can get hard to bear. The strong pop voice that was on her earlier records are buried deep under the hook laiden beats. And unlike Madonna (who makes an appearance here) or Janet Jackson, Britney does not seem to have an artistic vision. As sex-oriented as 'In The Zone' tried to be, it's no 'Erotica' or 'Janet' (both great pop albums by the way). Britney sings about her sex drive,d but she does not sound like she has a clear direction of where the music is going and she hardly touches on any serious subject matter.<br />So in the end, Britney STILL has not grown up enough to make a serious pop album that kick ass. No doubt this album will sell very well, but it's not much of an artistic statement. And artistic statement is what Britney needs to make at this point of her career.

Selections From &quot;The Nutcracker&quot;: Overture Miniature/Dance Of The Sugar Plum Fairy/Trepak/Valse Des Fleurs<BR>14. I Heard The Bells On Christmas Day<br />The Carpenters released two Christmas albums on LP, &quot;Christmas Portrait&quot; and &quot;An Old Fashioned Christmas&quot;.  Their first CD release, also called Christmas Portrait, was a combination of the two LPs, mostly the first with some selections from the second.  Some songs were given enhanced (or, at least, altered) arrangements,while others were omitted because of space considerations, although most Carpenter fans have undoubtably questioned the choices for years.<br />&quot;Christmas Collection&quot; is, finally, the original LPs, in their entirely, released together on CD.  This is the music the Carpenters were born to make.  Their sweet, sometimes corny arrangements and interpretations fit perfectly with these traditional and modern holiday classics.  Karen's bright, clear voice adds a freshness to this music that few other singers could offer.  Her warm, wholesome, &quot;girl next door&quot; singing brings to mind the image of a snow-covered American Christmas, from the star atop the tree to the rug by the fireplace.  Not bad for two 20-somethings from Southern California, as they were when they recorded these songs!<br />The accompanying orchestral arrangements and layered vocals give this collection an elegant, timeless foundation, if a little overdone sometimes.  While the Carpenters (mostly Richard) sometimes overwhelmed his songs with as much production as he could cram into 3 minutes, here he has just the right touch.  It's a little unusual to hear Carpenters music with other singers providing background vocals, but they work just fine on this collection.  <br />In the end, the buying decision comes down to Karen's voice.  If you've always hated it, you probably don't want this collection.  If you've always loved it, either you already own this double-CD set or you have the single CD and/or the LPs and you're wondering whether or not to spend the money.  The answer:  YES!  If you're somewhere in the middle, this music is guaranteed to make you a Carpenters fan, a Christmas music fan, or both.
B0000DJZA5|5.0|To state the bleeding obvious, the decision to release Let it Be...Naked has caused many a heated debate.  The point that seems to have been sorely missed by many folks is that the quality of the songs remains high, regardless of their incarnations.<br />Personally, I like the naked versions of the title track and The Long And Winding Road.  Are they better than the Spector versions? Yes and No.  For one, I think Spector's orchestrations were quite well done, despite the heavy-handed production.  However, stripped of the choirs and strings, it's nice to clearly hear those classic Beatles harmonies that were buried so deep into the Spector mix, and it's also great to hear Paul's delicate piano work.  As far as the rest of the songs on the naked album are concerned, they don't differ drastically from the original soundtrack tunes (maybe a line here or lick here there), though in my opinion the stripped production doesn't make the songs sound as contrived (particularly John's stellar Across the Universe).  <br />The fact is if you already have the much talked about bootlegs of the Get Back sessions, the only thing you're paying for is perhaps improved sound quality.  Those who came in late with the release of 1 will definitely want to check out the new release.  Those of us who aren't in possession of the bootlegs or the anthologies (obviously there are quite a few otherwise it wouldn't be selling so well) will want to check out how the album would have sounded if things had worked out as planned.  If you've already got the original release, have a listen to the naked album before purchasing (that's the only way you'll know if you like it).<br />The second disc is pretty much a waste of time for any fan, new or old.  There are some brief song snippets, some confusing conversations, and a whole lot of background noise.  The very least that could have been done would be to edit the recording into tracks, and have Paul or Ringo or even Yoko (!) provide some sort of commentary on what was going on at certain points.  I don't know if that'd be a popular idea, but I do know that the second disc is a real let down when we could have had some better bonus material released (such as alternate takes).
B0000E1ALR|3.0|For this review I will focus mainly on disc 3 as all long time fans of The Boss like me will have everything on the first two discs anyway, and if you are only a casual fan then I suggest you just go out & buy it because discs 1 & 2 will give you a pretty fair representation of his career to date.  No more needs to be said about those discs.<br />Now as for disc 3...<br />I have tried to get my hands on as many of Bruce's recordings as I can over the years, and have been frustrated that so many non-album tracks have only been released in dribs and drabs.  I loved his \\"Tracks\\" compilation, but even that collection was not complete.  Therefore I was pleased to find a bonus disc of  rareities with this compilation and thought it was worth buying for disc three alone.  Closer attention proved I was wrong...<br />The stand-out tracks on disc 3 are the first 2: \\"From little things big things come\\" and \\"Big payback.\\"  Besides these songs though there is nothing much on offer here.  The three 3 live songs are ok, but live songs by themselves don't do much for me, I prefer a whole live album experience.  \\"Dead man walking\\" is a good song but I already have it (got the movie sound track for just this song), and I already have \\"Missing\\" from a bonus disc with the Australian release of \\"The Ghost Of Tom Joad\\".<br />Unfortunately the rest of the tracks on disc 3 are sub-Bruce-standard, and the production standard for some is just plain awfull.  I was eager to hear the alternate version of \\"Countin' on a miracle\\" but to be frank is is real bad.  I don't like the style of it but what really gets up my nose is the production quality.  I know it was a home-made recording job, but that's where it should have stayed, it's not worthy of commercial release.<br />Even though tracks 1 & 2 on disc 3 are great, for me this release is not \\"essential\\".  There are not enough \\"good\\" rare tracks on offer here to justify bying it, and I think many long time fans might agree.  Bruce Springsteen has released so much good material over the years, but I have to agree with another reviewer who said he would prefer the older albums to be digitally re-mastered and re-released with bonus tracks on them.<br />I just hope that this release is not another \\"stop-gap\\" to keep us satisfied for a few years between regular albums, and that Bruce has another album as good as the excellent \\"The Rising\\" on the way in the not to distant future.<br />The 3 stars is because it's not a bad compilation, but that's it.released so much good material over the years, but I have to agree with another reviewer who said he would prefer the older albums to be digitally re-mastered and re-released with bonus tracks on them. <br />I just hope that this release is not another \\"stop-gap\\" to keep us satisfied for a few years between regular albums, and that Bruce has another album as good as the excellent \\"The Rising\\" on the way in the not to distant future.<br />The 3 stars is because it's not a bad compilation, but that's it.
B00000099Y|5.0|There are plenty of reviewers that rave on and on about how &quot;fantastic&quot; this album is (along with lateralus) Both of them are indeed excellent. However, to those who are uninitiated into the world of tool - this constant idiotic ranting holds no weight. - So some crazy metalheads cant stop raving on and on about how great these albums are - really! - what self-respecting newbie to tool, would really take any notice or care? <br />As it is a rainy day outside - i have compiled a brief but weighty arguement over the musical merit of tool by comparing the band to a strand of 17 Century English Literature. After finishing this paragraph - i am now going to have some potato wedges with some sweet chilli...  <br />I am back now - and as i said, i am here to combat these mindless reviewers who cannot elaborate on their ideas due to too many years of mary jane. i would prefer to excel my own arguement with a healthy dose of English literature and liken aenima (and indeed lateralus - hey im not writing 2 reviews) with the works of the metaphysical poet John Donne, responsible for some very clever infusions of wit, skill and genius through his very dense conceits and poetic compositions (for some background, see his poems &quot;The Flea&quot; and &quot;The Sunne Rising&quot; and then do a semester of metaphysical poetry to actually grasp and understand the sheer genius that is Donne). Fully Appreciating Donne's poems take quite a few readings as does listening to Tool's albums. Like Donne, Tool has the freakish ability to pump their works with an addictive, almost dangerous (and in my own humble opinion) &quot;god-like&quot; skill. Tool inhabits an incomprehensibly rewarding domain that the only the greats of creativity dwell (Donne, Bach, Shakespeare etc).<br />People - acquire the entire catalogue of tool's work and enrich your intellect, your senses and your soul.

B00005JMFO|5.0|It's lovely and a delightful bit of Chrismas cheer.  <BR>It ain't Shakespeare, but if it doesn't give you a nice warm feeling deep down inside - then I'm guessing that TEXAS CHAINSAW MASSACRE is more your flavor.
B000067G3C|5.0|You're going to say one thing after watching &quot;Speed,&quot; and that will be &quot;Whoa.&quot; This is an action film as exhausting as &quot;Die Hard&quot; and as exhilarating as the &quot;Terminator&quot; movies. It moves with the pacing of a John McTiernan picture and it has the perfection of a James Cameron action film. Its director, Jan De Bont, has worked on such films as &quot;Die Hard&quot; and &quot;The Hunt for Red October,&quot; so it's no surprise that he bears a resemblance behind the camera to McTiernan.<br />The film is blunt, fast-paced and extremely exciting. It stars Keanu Reeves as Jack Traven, a Los Angeles bomb squad member as cool as he is decisive. Jack has been called into duty, along with his partner and friend, Harry (Jeff Daniels), to stop a madman bomber (Dennis Hopper), who has taken control of an elevator and will drop it to the ground unless his demand of three million dollars is met.<br />Jack takes his chances and ends up saving the day, but not before Harry is taken hostage and survives with a bullet shot. Howard Payne (Hopper) is dead, blown to pieces by his own bomb, and so they all go have a drink and party till the moon goes down and the sun rises up. You get the idea.<br />But Payne didn't really die, and now he's very mad at a certain somebody who foiled his last plan. He's spent a lifetime being treated as dirt, and he has convinced himself that he deserves the $3 million more than anybody else. Jack begs to differ, but he has no time to argue when Payne reappears and triggers a downtown bus with a bomb. The catch? If the bus accelerates past 50 M.P.H. and then drops below that point as before...kaboom.<br />Jack manages to board the bus, but not before it reaches 50, and not before the bus driver gets shot by a criminal on the bus and Annie (Sandra Bullock) has to play driver for the rest of the day. The problem is, downtown LA during rush hour is not exactly open to a large bus, so with the help of the LAPD, the bus is driven to a deserted stretch of highway, where they have a limited amount of time to either disarm the bus or pay up the sum of money to Payne. <br />Meanwhile, Howard Payne is monitoring everything from his position in an apartment in LA, where he has a gadget wired up to the security camera in the bus, so that he can watch everything that's happening. If anyone tries to get off the bus, or if anyone tries to be a hero, he presses a little red button and.kaboom. Only this time, he's determined not to fail.<br />This is a ludicrously and ridiculously delicious plot. I'm surprised it hasn't been done already. Well, actually, it sorta has. Yes, this film bears an uncanny resemblance to &quot;Die Hard,&quot; only on a bus, but you know what? It's just about as good. It's exciting, humorous, and absolutely fun from start to finish. It never stops to go into boring conversations back at the FBI headquarters that so many action films do to try and make them look smarter. It never lets up for a moment once it starts. <br />All good action films have comedic relief, and &quot;Speed&quot; - apart from occasional witty remarks between Sandra Bullock and Keanu Reeves and/or Dennis Hopper - has Alan Ruck and Jeff Daniels. You may remember Ruck as Cameron Frye in John Hughes' &quot;Ferris Bueller's Day Off&quot; (1986), and you may remember him from the television show &quot;Spin City,&quot; and here he plays a tourist who isn't really able to understand the situation they're in on the bus. &quot;The airport?&quot; he says as the bus swerves down a runway. &quot;I've already been here.&quot;<br />Daniels is one of cinema's great character actors with dry subtle humor. He can do dramatics (&quot;Gettysburg&quot;), he can do comedy (&quot;Dumb and Dumber&quot;), and he can now do action. It takes an odd sort of acting genius to subtly upstage Jim Carrey, but he did just that in &quot;Dumb and Dumber&quot; by making a subtle goofball out of his character, Harry Dunne. Here he does the same with the sort of bleak sarcastic quips he was born to say.<br />Jan De Bont knows how to film action. Just when you think everything's going to slow down after the bus finally stops, we realize it's just the beginning. Payne kidnaps Annie, takes her to a subway train, and tries to run away with her to lure Jack. It works. And in the climatic gripper, Jack and Payne fight on the top of a speeding subway train. It was done in &quot;Mission: Impossible&quot; a small number of years later, but this came first. And the film is better.<br />Can Keanu Reeves act? Hardly. He does his usual &quot;Whoa&quot; routine here, where his lines primarily consist of long pauses and, &quot;Huh?&quot; &quot;What?&quot; &quot;Whoa,&quot; &quot;Wow,&quot; &quot;F--k me,&quot; &quot;Bogus,&quot; and so on. But an action film doesn't need a good actor, and Reeves fits the part. It was his breakthrough action role - without it, he never would have appeared in &quot;The Matrix.&quot;<br />&quot;Speed&quot; is one of the great action films. It bears similarities to &quot;Die Hard,&quot; &quot;Lethal Weapon,&quot; &quot;RoboCop,&quot; &quot;Total Recall,&quot; &quot;The Terminator&quot; (1 and 2), &quot;Predator,&quot; and all those other hard-punching action films with a fast pace and a real kick (it doesn't bear resemblance to all of the films as much as the raw force behind them). You know the kind of hard action flicks I mean - the kind that make you feel beaten up by the time it's all over. The kinds that make you leave the theater bruised and swollen.<br />You're going to be going 50 miles per hour watching &quot;Speed,&quot; and in this case, that's a good - no, great - thing.
B00005JM02|2.0|Okay, naming one of the fish's 'Gill' is so basic, and lazy, and just flat-out pathetic. Hey! Kind of like the movie itself! That's like calling an elephant 'Trunk', or a tiger 'Stripes'... uh oh, I'm giving Pixar more ideas for their NEXT &quot;masterpiece&quot;. I know what to expect. Some kid being lost and someone trying to save him and get him back to his family. Case in point, Finding Nemo is basically just chase after chase after chase after chase after CHASE! Guess it's tough being a fish. They need to get Nemo back to his dad! Much like the monsters had to get Boo back to her family in Monsters Inc. Much like the Sloth and Mammoth had to get the baby back to it's family in Ice Age (non-Pixar movie). Much like the toys getting back to Andy in Toy Story. Much like... oh well, you get the point. Oh yeah, wasn't Dinosaur about getting someone back to its family too? Heh. Lame and boring.
B0000DD7LB|4.0|This is her best CD to date. She is more than a woman. At times she is a little too full of herself...but she looks good...so...? It's pretty much an all dance CD, which is great! VERY infectious beats, and she co wrote over half the songs! WO! Even her attempts at balladry &quot;Shadow&quot; and &quot;Everytime&quot; are very good. She is not known for her voice but these songs standout for their melody and words. She did a good thing by ditching Rami and Max Martin as her main writers....it gave this CD a much less bubble gum pop flavor and more hip hop. The song &quot;Breathe On Me&quot; reminds me WAY too much of a Kylie Minogue tune....but, it it still good. I do not like the song &quot;The Hook Up&quot;.....trying too hard to capture that reggae sound...does not work for Britney. This cd is deffinatley geared more towards an older crowd which she suceeded in doing so. A Must!
B0000C6E4D|3.0|Its great to hear from Sarah again.  I love the 1st song fallen!  The rest of the CD is still growing on me.  I don't think it is as good as Surfacing, but its pretty damn close.  I would recommend this CD to Sarah fans.
B00005QZWI|5.0|I'm not sure how you can describe such a powerful score in 1,000 words.  This is the first instrumental CD I ever received, and since then, I have started collecting great movie scores.  Even through all the ones I've listened to, I stand by the opinion that this is the best ever!  It has a powerful theme that will leave you humming and whistling all the time.  It's a great buy.
B00009TB5G|5.0|Once again, Peter Jackson and the rest of the team working on Lord of the Rings have stepped up and given us a stellar DVD package.<br />It's commonplace to pack extra features and interviews into DVD offerings these days, but to date, no one does it like Jackson.  Two full DVDs of insights into cast, crew, direction, production, post-production, etc, create a sprawling backstory to the excellent second film in the trilogy.<br />In addition, several new scenes have been added to the film, fleshing out the story and adding in quite a few aspects that I felt deserved to be in the film, as well as providing background for some of the choices the writers had to make in changing Tolkien's original story.<br />The two most significant of these, to me, are the flashback scene with Boromir that helps to soften the changes made in Faramir's character.  Jackson and writer Philippa Boyens point out, quite reasonably, that it is a little odd for the book-Faramir to throw off the voice of the ring, it being the most evil and corrupting influence in the entire world of Middle-Earth.  Their need to have Faramir be a barrier for Frodo drove them to rewrite his character, but the Theatrical release cut did not do justice to his reasoning.  The extended cut quite adequately fleshes this out.<br />I was thrilled to see that they added Treebeard sending the trees to Helm's Deep; I was disappointed to see that scene gone from theatrical release, and I think they did a stellar job of knitting it back in.  That scene also helped to smooth the jarring presence of the Elves in Helm's deep; a point that was a necessary alteration, but one that had many hard-core Tolikienites grumbling.<br />As with the previous Platinum Series DVD, the real meat of the release is the behind-the-scenes information.  Viewers get a continued insight into the massive scope of the production, including the breathtaking effort behind the building of Edoras and the subsequent removal of the sets.  Also with the introduction in the film of Gollum, there's a lot of Andy Serkis in the special features, and it's a real treat to see how this talented and charismatic actor did so well bringing gollum to life while filming, he caused changes in the design of the character in order to do him justice.<br />The DVD is too dense with goodies to give a comprehensive review; I've just gone over my personal highlights.  If you're a fan of the movies, this version is a must-have for your collection.roduction in the film of Gollum, there's a lot of Andy Serkis in the special features, and it's a real treat to see how this talented and charismatic actor did so well bringing gollum to life while filming, he caused changes in the design of the character in order to do him justice.<br />The DVD is too dense with goodies to give a comprehensive review; I've just gone over my personal highlights.

B0000DZEA1|5.0|The Return of the King soundtrack is a splendid conclusion to the magnificent music which has so enhanced Peter Jackson's movies.  It is also worthy of J.R.R. Tolkien's books themselves, than which there can be no higher praise.<br />There are echoes of the scores from The Fellowship of the Ring and The Two Towers throughout this soundtrack, but there is also much new material which is just as beautiful.  The first few tracks begin rather softly, which seems odd until you remember that much of the first sections of this movie will inevitably have to retrace some ground.  I found Minas Tirith and The White Tree suitably majestic and evocative of the great City of the Kings of Men.  The Steward of Gondor has an appropriately martial air, but a nice solo by Billy Boyd adds extra depth at the end.  Cirith Ungol and Shelob's Lair have a nice creepy, tense tone.  The battle music is among the most stirring I have ever heard.<br />The most beautiful track is Anduril, which reminds me of the beautiful elven music for Rivendell and Lorien in The Fellowship of the Ring.  Probably the most evocative track is The Return of the King, which has numerous echoes from the other movies, including the Concerning Hobbits track from the Fellowship of the Ring, interestingly enough, and includes a short solo by Viggo Morgensen singing Elendil's Coronation Oath.<br />I have been a Tolkien enthusiast for over thirty years (since I was twelve) and while no movie can ever hope to fully capture the true magic of Middle earth, Peter Jackson's films and their music by Howard Shore are the closest we on these shores can hope to see, hear, and feel of that world.
B00005YW4H|5.0|Norah Jones has one of those rare singing voices, one whose quality and timbre awaken something unnameable within the listener, feelings of peace, tranquility, beauty, and heartbreak.<br />Jones is a refreshing escape from a recent flurry of pop divas, r&amp;b crooners, and guitar-strumming Dave Matthews clones.  Her guitar playing is a precise, picking style, melding perfectly with her sweet voice and simple, evocative lyrics.<br />Her songs are individual explorations of love, loneliness, passion, and musing.  &quot;Don't Know Why&quot; is a deserved sensational hit, it's catchy beat is threaded with wonderful turns of phrase like &quot;Heart is drenched in wine.&quot;  &quot;Come away with me&quot; is a beautiful love song, pleading with every lyric.  &quot;Lonestar,&quot; &quot;Turn Me On,&quot; and &quot;Nightingale&quot; are other outstanding songs, but this album is brilliant overall; it would be hard to say there are any bad songs on it at all.<br />In a time when singer-songwriters are a somewhat threatened species, Norah Jones' debut makes a powerful statement.  She is prepared to stake out new space for herself, while simultaneously evoking memories of vocalists from Billie Holiday to Joni Mitchell.  Simultaneously soulful, poppy, folky and bluesy, Jones is a cut above the rest.
B0000CD5I6|5.0|I hadn't listened to Jethro Tull in over twenty years, when in a mood of nostalgia I put on &quot;Heavy Horses&quot; and instantly hooked my twelve-year old son on Tull.  This CD sounds like it could be made up of outtakes (and for Tull, even outtakes are often masterpieces; e.g. &quot;Broadford Bazaar&quot;) from the band's heyday in the 70s.  &quot;Jack Frost and the Hooded Crow&quot; could have been on &quot;Songs from the Wood,&quot; &quot;First Snow on Brooklyn&quot; sounds like a return to the emotional and musical terrain of &quot;Minstrel in the Gallery,&quot; thirty years later (&quot;I believe it only rained around here these thirty years,&quot; say the lyrics).  And &quot;We Five Kings&quot; is a brilliant hybrid of &quot;We Three Kings&quot; and &quot;Living in the Past.&quot;   Ian Anderson still has a great, distinctive voice, and his flute and Martin Barre's guitars sound better than ever.  Highly recommended for those, like me, who have always wished there was more of &quot;Songs from the Wood&quot; and &quot;Heavy Horses.&quot;
B00005JM02|4.0|First, let me say that I really did enjoy this movie, and I found it to be funny, cute, and well-plotted.  I'd suggest it to anyone who enjoys the likes of &quot;Toy Story&quot; and &quot;The Lion King.&quot;<br />However, though this movie may be infinitely rewatchable for kids, I'm not sure the same can be said for adult viewers.  I mention this because being a parent, I know that if you buy this movie for your kid, you will probably have to watch it at least three dozen times or more. What makes &quot;Toy Story&quot; so great in my opinion is that the characters' expressions and body movements add to their &quot;performances,&quot; and they really afford nuances that give the movie a kick of extra charm.  &quot;Finding Nemo,&quot; as funny and endearing as it may be, is a bit limited by the character design--fish--so the main bulk of humor lies in the voice acting and script, and often not much in the characters' demeanors.<br />I'm sure that many people won't care too much about this small quibble of mine, but because I watch animation so much, these things really catch my eye and can make all the difference in the world for me, and as great as &quot;Finding Nemo&quot; is, I think it's better suited to kids, not because it's not funny or entertaining, but because only kids will still find it to be funny and entertaining upon the 5th, 50th, or 500th viewing.<br />By all means, however, buy this movie for your kid.  I haven't met a kid yet who didn't love it, and it is a better production than much of what is specifically tailored to adults, anyway.
B0000DD7NL|1.0|Diary of Alicia Keys was disappointing and waste of my money.  I expected so much after listening to her single, &quot;You Don't Know My Name&quot;.  I was thinking that Alicia was going to set it off and really bring it.  I thought the first CD,Songs in A Minor, was an OK CD, but did not live up to the hype.  I think she is talented. Don't get me wrong, but on this cd she seems to be rambling and out of artistic steam.  It seems as though she is trying to &quot;be&quot; so many things (neo-soulster, 70's soulster, and classical).  She managed to pull it off on the first CD, but on The Diary, it doesn't seem natural.  It's forced.  She gets a gold star for &quot;You Don't Know My Name&quot;.  Maybe those that buy into the hype, and are not interesting in musical depth will enjoy this CD.

B00006RU5B|5.0|This cd surprised me alot. Audioslave is such a good band when you listen to this cd. I think its the best cd of this year. I think the best songs on the album are show me how to live, set it off, like a stone, and i am the highway. show me how to live is probably my favorite song right now and has been for a while. If your looking for a good rock cd, this is the one.
B00005JMFO|5.0|Okay, I'll admit it, I went into this film with super high expectations, as Notting Hill and Bridget Jones Diary are two of my all time favorite movies, but I was so totally smitten by this movie that I had to write my first review to share with others.  I've never seen a movie that so adeptly dramatizes the many forms in which love affects us.  Each (main) character (not counting the silly little parts played by the nude stand-ins) was so earnest and \\"naked\\" in their utter surender to the reprecussions of true love, that it broke my heart while making me laugh all at the same time.  Loved it, Loved it, Loved it!
B0000DZEA1|5.0|It seems incredible the maturity of this score. I love the other two and they are great but here, at last, you have a Howard Shore score that reaches the level of a John Williams. The little touches, the massive coral parts, the sublime use of soloists, th leit motivs that make little changes to earlier music, like they were grown from the innocence of the first part to be wiser and more complicated. An example is the Shire Theme, a subtle but major difference with the original. And the Return of the King track, oh my God! incredible in composition, interweaving of themes and the glorious Into the West theme that ends the triology in a climax not often seen in movies. The song at the end follows the same path. FOTR´s was pure longing, TTT pure menace and unease feeling, this one  triumph, not only physical but mainly spiritual with Annie Lennox ´s gorgeous voice climbing to heaven and, paradoxically working as a  peace lullaby. In a word: Masterpiece<br />Again, excuses for my english :)
B00006JJ1O|4.0|This is really a very good album and it represents a real cultural cross-over.  I wanted to reject notions that translations might be suspect, as expert opinions on the subject are readily available (My Wife) and the translations capture the context and the meaning very well.  T.A.T.U. is comparable to the musical revolution of the 60's and 70's in the states.  The music is socially revolutionary in a very real sense.  Buy it and see!!!
B0000VCZK2|2.0|I have to agree with many of the other reviewers, only Alien and Aliens are worth watching.  Alien 3 and Resurrection are absolutely awful.  That's probably why Fox didn't release the single movie editions at the same time, hoping people will fork over the bucks for this set.  They also try and attract the fence sitters by including a 9th disc only available in this set.  Well I'm not biting.  You'll have to wait until Jan. 6 to get your hands on the single movie two disc releases, which I plan to do.<br />Apparently, this set took a year to produce and is claimed to be the ultimate.  It didn't take me 10 minutes to find a major flaw in the set.  Only Alien and Resurrection have DTS audio tracks.  Producers claim there was not enough disc space to include the DTS track due to the length of Aliens and Alien 3.  I find this extremely hard to believe.  Terminator 2 Ulimate Edition is two minutes longer than Aliens SE and that disc had an audio commentary, Dolby Digital EX, AND DTS ES.  Bunch of BS if you asked me.  The lack of a DTS track on Aliens is a major goof and, as such, just dropped the title from my reference list.<br />Also, the art and foldout packaging really sucks.<br />These blunders are nothing new from Fox.  Keep in mind, they are the same bunch of bozos that gave us the non-anamorphic special edition DVD of The Abyss.  Get a clue Fox!
B000002AVF|5.0|\\"Daydream\\" is the best Mariah album and she truly sings her heart out on every song.  Not only do you have great ballads, you also have some fast songs, too.  \\"Long Ago\\" is my favorite, as well as \\"Forever\\".  You will not have to skip over ANY song on this CD.  Also, once you listen to this, there is just NO comparison to any other Mariah album that she did after 1995-with the exception of \\"Butterfly\\" in 1997.  It just seems that her songs and everything went downhill after this.  If you get this, you will not be disappointed.  I only wish that Mariah could somehow recapture the magic from this album.
B0000CEB4V|5.0|This concert should not be missed! Hearing &amp; seeing Sam Brown do &quot;Horse to Water&quot; made everything else fall into place.  Yes, Ringo was there with his drum kit, but Jim Keltner was there playing his as only he can.  This also introduced me to Jools Holland and reminded me of what music should be.  Bravo to the producers of this concert and to George's family: &quot;Thanks For The Memories&quot;.
B0000028VT|5.0|This is one of my most favorite CD's and also for Mariah.  There are 8 ballads and 2 up/tempo songs on this.  &quot;Anytime You Need A Friend&quot; is such a good song, that alone is worth the entire CD.  Every song on here is worth listening to, and her voice really comes through.  There is such a difference here on &quot;Music Box&quot; as compared to &quot;Charmbraclet&quot; or some of her later albums.  Her voice is not covered up by overproduced synthesized &quot;music&quot; and she does not have any &quot;guests&quot; ruining any of her beautiful songs.
1586210912|5.0|As great as the book is, the information from Rich Dad Poor Dad really comes to life on the cd. I am more of an auditory learner so listening makes learning easier for me. I played this cd audio for 21 days straight untill Kiyosaki's words became my words. <br />I have the book too, but the cd's really rock. Read the book but listen to the cd audio as well. You'lll earn faster and since this is the subject of wealth, doesn't it make sense to maximize your learning? Yeah! I knew you would agree.<br />Great book and cd program.

B0000CD5FN|4.0|Enough has been said about the untimely loss of Joe Strummer and the impact he had on our lives. As a very doubting agnostic, my wife asked me recently &quot;without a religion, where do you get your ideals?&quot;, and the first name to come to mind was Joe Strummer. Joe is a man who I have worshipped since I was a rebellious teen and still do even as I push 40. His music and his messsage gets into your blood and your soul, and &quot;StreetCore&quot; is no different; it is a wonderful cap-off to an amazing career, albeit a little sad, as the man just seemed to be hitting his stride again when the Grim Reaper decided to make his unwanted appearance.<br />If there is in fact an afterlife, I hope Joe finds that heaven is a more just place than earth, and that he sees his pluralistic vision of a better world come to fruition, even if we can't all enjoy it in this life. <br />Rest in peace Joe, and thanks for the music!
B0000TB03W|5.0|I've been a Shania fan for quite some time now.  I received her UP Live in Chicago DVD as a birthday gift this year and couldn't be happier!  This would make a great Christmas gift for any Shania fan!
B00006879E|5.0|listen before you buy, there must be something to the band for so many people to like them. But do not buy the cd based upon the first song because like all the other reviews, the rest of the album is different, but really good.
B0000AXE8I|2.0|This film is waaaaay too talky than the original... some effects were cool, but whassup with the story?
0780622553|5.0|As essential as The Matrix.<br />Film Noir-Sci Fi that questions reality and existence, and it's got Kieffer.<br />This movie is as influential as the Matrix, and will stand the test of time (The Matrix may not). Great acting, beautiful set design, and \\"a splinter in your mind\\" theme runs throughout.<br />Dark City asks \\"Who am I?\\", and the answer is profound, if slightly disturbing.
B00005JLWN|5.0|I must say, this is an excellent filmed movie and I'm disappointed in not seeing it come out in the cinemas.<BR>(compared) to the matrix, I myself and my friends liked this one better, though I'm not saying they are the same, the matrix is completly different in storyline and plots than of Equilibrium.<br />The storyline is great though not original but well enhanced :P<br />The film is a mix of Orwell's 1984, Fahrenheit 451 and the old Metropolis. Based in a ruined dystopia world where art, music, literature, emotions and anything expressional are the causes of mankinds trouble (war love and hate) and are prohibited in the totalitatian state of Liberia which control the people with injections of prozium to make them into unemotional working zombies for Big brother who has his Grammaton Clerics busting down sense offenders who oppose the states tactics and laws.<br />The gun fights (gun kata) is the first I've ever seen in years in action flicks and Theres also some nice quick sword-fighting aswell. An excellent low budget film that should of made it on the screen and gotten <br />I recommend this film to all my friends<BR>It will blow you away ;)
0446310786|5.0|I feel that 5 star reviews are given a bit too often on amazon. However, here is a book that deserves every one. This is just a fantastic story. I first read this in Highschool and did not really care for it. I picked it up again and wow! Harper Lee's writing is simple, humorous, touching, nostalgic in tone, always bringing you more and more, step by step, into her world. At the end I found myself on the inside, looking out, not wanting to return to the real world.

B000001DTM|5.0|Topping the Joshua Tree wasn't easy. Imagine the band writing new songs with THAT album behind them --- they must have thought &quot;We've peaked.&quot; But Achtung Baby is better. Working in Berlin with their two secret weapons --- Daniel Lanois and Brian Eno --- they created a modern masterpiece. Where Joshua Tree almost sounds dated with its evocation of American hymnals, acoustic beauty, and political sincerity, Achtung Baby just gets better and better every year. It's still smart and surprising.<br />It signaled a change for the band (skirting around self-parody of their image by adding a dose of well-earned humor) and a change in rock music. In the watershed year of 1991, Nirvana released Nevermind, Pearl Jam debuted with Ten, and U2 released Achtung Baby. (Not to mention MBV's Loveless, Metallica's black album, and Mr Bungle's self-titled debut. A great year for music.)<br />Every track is impressive. The album builds and builds. The lyrics are excellent, veering from commentary of mass media to The Edge's divorce to the need for love. Bono sings in the voice of Judas (&quot;The End of the World&quot;), he describes that feeling late at night in the pub when you love everyone (&quot;Trying to Throw Your Arms Around the World&quot;), and then he captures the heart of The Joshua Tree in a single song (&quot;Ultraviolet, Light My Way&quot;).<br />If you're like me, you've heard this album at least once a month since the day it came out --- and it still feels right. Not only did U2 prove they hadn't hit their peak yet, they proved they could reinvent themselves without losing their fans in the process.
B0000DYJM6|5.0|Ok first of all i only started listening to Pearl Jam since a couple of months ago so I am sorta just a casual fan.  I only have Ten as PJ's other album, yeah i know shame, shame.  ANyway I decided to pick this album up because of the beautiful beautiful Yellow Ledbetter song I heard on the radio recently.  <br />After listening to both cds all i have to save is WOW.  This album is really amazing from beginning to end with only a couple of excepttions of some weird songs. I asked myself whoa if this is only their b-sides and rarities then their other official albums must be total bliss and I bet they are =).  <br />On CD 1 it seems that the songs are more rocking and energetic than the second one.  Magnificent highlights include sad, down, undone, and of course the legendary yellow ledbetter.<br />On CD 2 PJ is more relaxed and mellow with quieter and smoother songs.  My personal favorites on this are fatal, footsteps, last kiss, and the instrumental song near the end.<br />ALl in all I really think this is a magnificent album and that u should definitely pick this up even if ur not a hardcore pj fan =).
B00005JM02|5.0|Finding Nemo is a fantastic movie and is even better on DVD. The special features shine and there's more easter eggs than you can shake a stick at. I really appreciate that they spent so much time making it so spectacular. The fact that they didn't just pan and scan on the fullscreen version, but actually rendered the full frame makes it so that you can be sure that you aren't missing anything regardless of which disc you're viewing. The commentary is great and I love that they put different special features on each disc. I hope all of Pixar's future releases live up to the quality of this one.
B0000DJZA5|5.0|forever.  In the college experimental years I had wondered and hoped to hear this album without Spector.  The average joe won't notice much of a difference but for the diehard Beatles fan this CD is a must.  If even just for &quot;Across the Universe&quot; alone.  There is a huge difference without those cheesy backing choir vocals that Spector slopped on the orginal &quot;Let It Be&quot; - I mean, I respect the &quot;wall of sound&quot; that Spector was known for with the female groups, but it did't fly with the Beatles.<br />The new mixes showcase the keyboard and guitar playing more than the original, obviously, since there isn't the over-the-top orchestra anymore. I love it.
B00008EY9G|2.0|If you've seen the Sixth Sense starring Bruce Willis, you know what its like to watch a quality suspense film with a monster of a twist at the end.<br />This movie falls far short of that standard, and I'm suprised to see so many good reviews. The shizophrenia angle seems chucked into the movie 3/4ths in and not stiched-in throughout the plot.<br />The result, I found, was ridiculous. If you want to watch a quality movie about the human mind playing tricks - I'd recommend the Sixth Sense or even Fight Club.<br />Those are films that bear repeat viewing. This one's a rental.
B00005JMFO|4.0|I had low hopes for this movie, but after watching it twice in one week, I have to admit that I am a little bit in love, actually. If you enjoy movies like Bridget Jones' Diary, then this is a movie for you. <BR>I thought the high number of parallel story lines would make this a very shallow and broken film, but somehow the actors and editing keeps it all running nicely. Actually, this is one of my favorite movies this year, and I will purchase it when it is released on DVD, hopefully with tons of juicy extras!
B0000C7PQK|4.0|In the late 1990, a soulful mix of dance beats, humming vocals, deep sighs and Gregorian chants came out of the blue and its name was Sadeness Part1. The result was massive hysteria and the MCMXC a.D album topped the charts around the world. <BR> <BR> Then, in 1993 Cross of Changes was released and everyone admired the diversity in the music of Cretu's project, Enigma.<br /> Three years later, Le Roi est Mort reached the stores. This unbearably ingenious album is still considered to be Enigma's best.<br />  More recently, in 2000, Carl Orff's classic opera piece, Carmina Burana, received the best sampling treatment to date and the result was the unmistakably majestic sound of the smash hit album, The Screen Behind the Mirror. <br />  After spending two or three years in production, Cretu released his last offering, Voyageur. Some consider it truly marvellous, others a disaster. I'd say its both, and that's what makes it so special.<br />  Michael Cretu, has imprisoned his child, Enigma, in a cocoon, expecting it to transform, to reinvent itself, and to come out shimmeringly beautiful. This cocoon would be Voyageur, in which the battle between past and present takes place. <br /> Voyageur's basic asset is the rhythms, rather than the melodies, which symbolize the struggle to survive, to transform, to become new. Voyageur can sound really strange in some places, but that's its beauty. It's just Enigma taking a different form.<br /> Begginners will find this album enjoyable, while die-hard fans will either love it or loathe it. It's more like a question of personal expectations about Enigma.<br /> Voyageur is Enigma5, it has brought changes and it has raised questions. but, its Enigma6 that will bring the answers..<br />PS: the version provided here, is not the one with the original cover (as potrayed in the picture) but the limited edition version, which, ironically, you can find almost anywhere.<br />But, what about the songs?<br />FROM EAST TO WEST: The same flute introduction sound which you could hear in the previous albums marks the starting point of the 5th enigma project, as well. Just when you think that nothing has changed, a dark techno-like beat comes in the surface and an intense instrumental with whistling sounds and breathtaking effects welcomes you in the Enigma5 experience. Good, but short<br />VOYAGEUR: Probably one of the best tracks on the album, if not one of the best songs of Enigma. An alluring deep bassline which plays from the beginning till the end of the song and the good old French Sandra vocals which still sound as fresh as they did in Sadeness, 13 years ago.<br />INCOGNITO: After a short break from Voyageur, in which Cretu lits a cigarette, a mumbling male voice, which plays the part of Incognito's bassline takes you in this strange, but interesting number. It sounds a lot like Chemical brothers, however a sample of Sadeness somewhere in the middle makes  it clear that what you hear IS Enigma. <br />PAGE OF CUPS: a chill-out instrumental number, very well constructed, and if you hear it in the right place at the right time you're sure to love it. However, it doesn't have much of the mystical atmosphere that you may find in other Enigma instrumentals such as Traces (E4) or Shadows in Silence (E3). Yet, it is pleasant and relaxing<br />BOUM-BOUM: Great pop song, which could have been better if not for the vocoders. Nevertheles, it is one of the most pleasant Enigma pop recordings.<br />TOTAL ECLIPSE OF THE MOON: Nice, yet incomplete, it sounds too short, and a little bit dated (ex.Cretu's 79's Moonlight and Flowers). However, that's a good thing since this song might be considered as an introduction to the next retro number, LOOK OF TODAY<br />LOOK OF TODAY: The chorus lines sound a lot like ABC's Look Of Love. (that's the look, that's the look). This was done in purpose, since this song is about vanity and passing trends. What else would be more capable of expressing those Ideas than an 80s-tehno sounding number?<br />IN THE SHADOWN IN THE LIGHT: Nice lyrics, but why so much distortion on the vocals? Pleasant, though. Some may find this song really moving, however, it didn't work that way for me.<br />WEIGHTLESS: Great Number! Probably too short, but those indescribable sounds that come from nowhere are enough to put you to sleep. Nice!<br />THE PIANO: If it wasn't for the cheesy title, this song could mean much more. Nice Ibiza sounds, great chill-out rhythms and atmosphere. All in all, a pleasant trip through sunseting Ibiza.<br />FOLLOWING THE SUN: This probably is the best track. You really have to listen to it to get the picture. Nice old Enigma school. Does this mean we're going back to the basics?<br />As I said before, E6 will bring the answers...
6305696071|3.0|I loved Pretty Woman in the theatres and wore my original VHS tape thin.  Does anyone know if the theatrical version - NOT THE DIRECTORS CUT - can be bought on DVD?  I know this movie so well that the additional footage in the directors cut drives me crazy.<br />Other than that - it's a excellent film
B000002B49|5.0|Music Detected was my first CD by Deep Forest, and I loved it. I was really suprised to see all the negative reviews for that album. I decided to check out Boheme, to see what all the fuss was about. Without a doubt, Boheme is a fantastic album. I still adore Music Detected, though. They are both wonderful in very different ways so it's hard to compare them. I am planning on checking out more by Deep Forest ASAP so that I can truly experience all the overflowing brilliant experimentations of the French duo.
B0000DJZA0|5.0|Coldplay makes for a brilliant live band, with no fuss and no unecessary flash. They might be a bit dull compared to others but they offer what many dont, the pure uncommercialised soul of what music should be.<br />Now we get to the dvd (which is frankly, probably more than half of what you pay for). I had to experiment with about 7 dvd players (wouldnt work with ever-so-efficient microsoft windows media player.. something to do with copyright protection apparently *rolls*eyes*) before i could get it to play. i'm just wondering whether it's to do with different region codes (region 1 on my computer). anyone else have this problem?<br />nonetheless, very much worth the money for anyone who apprecites coldplay.
B00005214X|5.0|I remember Christmastime 1970.  I was in my early teens.  My favorite music group, The Beatles had split up more than six months earlier.  Disappointed that I'd never hear anything new by the group, I naturally started following their solo careers.  Paul McCartney was among the first with &quot;McCartney&quot; which provided hope that perhaps the post-Beatles stuff won't be half-bad.  Now as 1970 was about to come to close, it was George Harrison's turn to shine in the solo spotlight.  The &quot;quiet&quot; Beatle emerges with an ambitious 3 LP set entitled &quot;All Things Must Pass&quot;.   <br />A track from that album, &quot;My Sweet Lord&quot; was released a month or so earlier as a single and was quite successful on the world's Top 40 charts.  With a hit record leading the way, the release of George's first real solo album had to be a hit as well.   <br />In the post-Christmas excitement, I realized that I didn't get the album as a present, although I told just about everyone who could hear how much I wanted it.    Then I realized I had gotten some cash as a Christmas present so I would put it to good use.   A trip to a nearby Musicland, the money practically burning a hole in my pocket, totally focused on going straight to the &quot;All Things Must Pass&quot; display, it was almost like tunnel vision in a way.   Got my sweaty hands on the shrink-wrapped box set, paid for it and as quickly as I entered I zoomed out of Musicland with home and my awaiting stereo as my destination.  I was a man on a mission.   When I got home I zipped straight up to my room, ripped the shrink-wrap of the album as fast as I could, opened the box set, took LP #1out of its sleeve, put it on the turntable, dropped the stylus on the album and held my breath.  Good thing, because as the opening measures of the Harrison/Dylan composition, &quot;I'd Have You Any Time&quot; played, I found myself actually breathless. <br />As it played, I'm thinking, wow, what an amazing sound.  Everything just sounded perfect.  The songwriting, the arrangements, the singing, the musicianship, the production, all of it was flawless.  Almost immediately I knew that George Harrison's first solo LP not only would be successful, but also would stand the test of time and to become a true classic.   I pretty much wore out that initial copy of &quot;All Things Must Pass&quot;, playing it over and over and over, which practically drove my folks a little nutty.    <br />In the years since I only occasionally listened to the LP.  Until the other day I hadn't listened to it in over fifteen years.  But something reminded me of the album, and I had to get the CD.  I popped the CD into my car stereo and experienced the most eerie sense of deja vu upon hearing again those opening measures of &quot;I'd Have You Anytime&quot;.  The entire CD was magnificent; it was better than I originally remembered it.  I was absolutely blown away by it.   <br />After thirty-three years, this music holds its age very well and like a fine wine has gotten better with time.   Far and away this is not only the finest post-Beatles debut, but probably the finest post-Beatle solo release of them all.   <br />If you even slightly like the Beatles... buy this CD... take a good listen and you'll hear what I mean.
B000099T2L|5.0|Beyonce Knowles has been in the spotlight since her young teenage years with the popular group Destiny's Child. Now that she is an adult, Beyonce takes the music industry by storm with her album Dangerously In Love.

The mood of the song is set through the tune and speed that creates an overwhelming effect about being overpowered with emotions.<BR>  Beyonce also adds a mixture f flavor to her album with Sean Paul in \\"Baby Boy.\\" This song is unlike a poem, but a story that creates a fancy. Beyonce and Sean Paul create a reggae flavor that's more appropriate for a dance club. Beyonce and Andre, a member from Outcast, also creates an R&B flavor twist with a touch of Rock n'Roll genre inthe song \\"Rock Star.\\" The instrumental drums in the background add an edgy tense beat.

Dangerously In Love is an album that can truly be played without skipping to the next song. When overwhelming situations come Dangerously In Love  has a song to set the mood.
B0000DD7NL|5.0|Oh my goddd!!!!<BR>She went and destroyed all the competition out there!<BR>All those plastic divas out there better start investing in tighter swimsuits and some vocal lessons cause Alicia has found all the right musical 'keys'!!<BR>A simply stunning,superb and charming album.....A DEFINITE MUST HAVE.<BR>Keep these gems coming Alicia...got my money ready for your next one already!!!<BR>Thank god real music is back!
B00008J4P5|5.0|This is rock they way rock should be.<br />Some social commentary, some anti-establishmentism, some whimsy, lots and lots of hard driving music.<br />Terrific, and if not the best album of 2003 it's at least in the top 5.<br />If you don't own this album, shame on you.
B0000DIXN7|5.0|What can I say-this is DEFINITELY one of the best albums I have heard this year!!<BR>I was completely blown away,this lady definitely deserves to be a big star in the upcoming year.<BR>I found this album by accident, so her record company better get their a** in gear and let people out there know about this amazing secret!!<BR>Simply fantastic still hooked, listening everyday.
B00008WT5C|4.0|AC/DC's 1977 release, LET THERE BE ROCK, is what it did. ROCKED!!!  The title track, plus WHOLE LOTTA ROSIE, & PROBLEM CHILD were instant classics, and still played today.  Even the weaker songs, GO DOWN, DOG EAT DOG, BAD BOY BOOGIE, are good rock songs.  HELL AIN'T A BAD PLACE TO BE (I bet Bon as changed is tune now), and OVERDOSE are very weak.  Still not bad if you like your songs about sex, drugs, and rock-n-roll, for AC/DC that's all there is.
B0000DD7NL|5.0|I'll confess, I am an Alicia Keys fan. I remember all the hype when Songs in A Minor came out. After seeing her perform at the MTV Awards, I had to buy that album. And I felt let down. Don't get me wrong, the album was good but it didn't live up to the hype. If there was one thing that could have described the album it was overrated.<br />This time around an album that gets less than half the hype is more than twice as good. There's a good mix of hip hop, soul, blues-- real blues and soul, not the commercial pop-ish R&amp;B that gets all the airplay.<br />Alicia Keys is incredibly talented to be so young. We can only hope that she has a long and healthy career because music needs more albums like this, pure talent and not pop vocals and lame lyrics over an overproduced beat.<br />This is album is well worth your money, you should not even think twice about buying it. From the first cut to the last, Diary has the makings of a classic.
0060931736|2.0|I feel that The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie written by Muriel Spark is a \\"good\\" novel.  It is not a spectacular story and it is not a horrible story either. For me, the novel was simply satisfying.<br />  The plot is not outrageously exciting.  The novel tells a story of a far-reaching teacher at a private girls school who is looked down upon by her superiors. She keys into the lives of a select number of students to try and broaden their horizons, and make them the &quot;crème de la crème&quot;.  The climax of the plot is fuzzy. The story had many ups and downs, but nothing extreme that sticks out in my memory. For me the novel was on the verge of boring.<br />   The novel tended to drag in some sections, especially in the first two chapters.  These chapters take an abnormally long time to introduce the characters and the setting.  Spark takes plenty of time to piece together these aspects for the reader. This was slightly frustrating for me.  It takes a while for the novel to really pick up and become interesting.  Spark is incredibly detailed throughout the novel making it boring for me during some parts, but mostly her descriptive writing worked to her advantage to paint a picture in the readers mind.<br />  Spark did a wonderful job of developing her characters and weaving their lives together throughout the novel.  As the story developed I felt that I was growing and learning with the characters. The story followed the lives of six schoolgirls from the age of twelve to adulthood and the influence of their radical teacher and friend Miss Jean Brodie.  Being a female I might be able to relate to and be more interested in the novel than others.<br />  Overall The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie was slightly boring and redundant, but still a satisfying read.
B00006CXSS|5.0|The problem with Ian's argument is that he is setting his own general anti-war agenda about America's involvement in WWII 60 years ago. Hello..America was attacked! Do we just ignore that?Does that mean anything at all?  He's wrong with this argument, period.  He is lumping in an antir-war present day argument with a brilliant  historical masterpiece of a film that puts anything Hollywood has ever released to shame.  The point is, this production is the best ever put to film.  If this was about pottery making, it would still be the best depiction of it's kind with insanely well put together band of actors, writing, music and cinematography.
0790729652|4.0|&quot;Batman&quot; stands as an example of how to make a good comic book film.  Above all, the film is just oozing with atmosphere, and &quot;Batman&quot;'s look is undoubtedly its #1 strength.  However, it also has some thrilling action sequences, a terrific villain (perhaps too good- see below), and, most importantly, a good man in the Batman suit.<br />The film belongs to Jack Nicholson- he is probably the real main character of this movie.  He makes the Joker both a funny and menacing character, and he gets all of the best lines.  This was a role Nicholson was born to play, and he enjoys it with relish.<br />Michael Keaton was the best Batman, in my opinion.  OK, so he is a little short, but no one else played the Bruce Wayne part better than he did.  He makes this a Batman to root for.  If only we saw more of him...<br />Which brings me to the film's main flaw- this is the Joker's film the entire way, not Batman's.  Why the filmakers decided to do this I don't completely understand, but it takes away something from the film.  We never really get to bond with the superhero in this one (this was somewhat remedied in &quot;Batman Returns&quot;).  Also, Kim Basinger's character is mainly eye candy and pales in comparison to future Batman girlfriends.<br />Nevertheless, I really do like this film, and I get caught up in its atmosphere every time I watch it- it still looks good 14 years later (although some of the Gotham backgrounds were obviously paintings).  This is largely thanks to director Tim Burton, who mostly understood how to handle Batman and his universe- he was the best man for this job.  He gets help from a great score by Danny Elfman and terrific designs by designer Anton Furst.<br />I would recommend this to all comic book fans, as it stands as an example of both a great comic book transition and of good filmaking in general.
B0000CDLA7|3.0|I have listened to this album at least 100 times now, and it is better than most of the rock bands out there today.  They are into new styles, and that is a good thing!  At first, you really don't like it, as a Dreat Theater fan.  However, once you get past your visions of what you believe Dream Theater should be, you really start to hear that the musical talent is still alive and well, but they have just taken that in a new direction.      What really struck me was that it is a very angry sounding album.  If you like older Metallica and some of the newer bands like Disturbed and Godsmack, this album would be a great choice for you.  However, if you are a long time Dream Theater fan, you will be left wondering who you just listened to, but give it a chance, it will really grow on you.  Some tracks sound like continuations of previous songs, and others are somewhat mainstream.
0790730960|5.0|&quot;Batman Returns&quot; is an improvement over its predecessor in almost every single way, and in my opinion is the best entry in the franchise.  This is largely because Tim Burton was allowed more creative freedom than with the first &quot;Batman&quot;, and so pours his heart and soul into it.  This is a Burton film more than anything else, and that's not a bad thing.<br />One needed improvement in this one is that Michael Keaton gets to flesh out his character more.  Bruce Wayne becomes more complex and sympathetic, a man who is doomed to protect Gotham but carries around deep personal insecurities.  In fact, Batman in this film acts more like a Marvel comics character than the one-dimensional Batman of the cheesy 60's show.  This feels more like Batman's film than the last one, and so makes us care about him more.<br />The villains are the best of the series.  Both the Penguin and the Catwoman are tragic characters that are somewhat sympathetic.  In fact, Catwoman's struggle is probably the real heart of this film- she's vengeful towards those who have hurt her in the past, but not really evil, and her motives are always mixed.  Michele Pfeiffer is absolutely terrific in this role.  Danny DeVito gives an unusual performance as the Penguin- he's demented and mean, angry at a society that treated him so badly.  Burton shows a certain fondness for the villains, so that we root against them but also sympathize with them at the same time.  Those wanting a more two-dimensional villain will get it in the form of business tycoon Max Shreck, who's out to destroy whichever character he can if it will get him more power in the city.<br />This was the best looking film of the series, even though future entries had bigger budgets and modern technology.  Burton and designer Bo Welch create a dark and convincing Gotham, a dangerous place to live even during Christmas time.  There's also a certain amount of fun shown in the look of this film that was not present in the firstone, as made apparent by the designs of many of the buildings and the frequent use of clowns and cats.<br />If you haven't guessed by now, I love this movie, and I believe it's the high point of the Batman franchise.  People debate over whether this or the first one is better; they're pretty close in quality, but I believe this one is because it's a more complex and unique film.  I only hope they re-release both of them on Special Edition DVD's someday with making-of features, because Tim Burton's vision of the Batman world was utterly fascinating.
B00005QZWI|5.0|The purpose of a soundtrack is to re-create the feeling of the film. People buy soundtracks because they enjoyed the films so much and want to experience that joy again. Howard Shore's soundtrack does this superbly.<br /><br />I've bought a lot of music soundtracks solely because of the film, and been very disappointed. The great thing about this CD is that it can stand on it's own, completely outside of the movie. So many soundtracks are filled with \\"sound effects\\" instead of actual music, and their scores simply serve to enhance the picture. Shore's work serves as an accompaniment of the scene, but also creates the feeling that you're back in the film again, and each track can hold it's own as a separate movement.<br /><br />For anyone who enjoyed this, I highly recommend [[ASIN:B000BNI90O The Lord Of The Rings: Fellowship Of The Ring (The Complete Recordings)]]
0385504209|5.0|Dan Brown's research into Catholicism, architecture, art history and DaVinci is apparent and impressive in this addictive piece of work.  Mr. Brown's manner of writing is such that you find yourself engrossed in the story, thinking alongside the protagonist as he reveals little known facts about the aforementioned areas of study.  This is a provocative book, challenging the reader to question formed beliefs and even do self-study into many of the revelations with which Dan Brown blesses us regarding history.  Coupled with the intense nature of the information is a fun and puzzle-solving storyline that makes the book extremely difficult to put down.  Almost all questions are answered in the end and leaves you wanting to read it again; but perhaps more entertaining - to discuss with fellow readers the topics and facts presented herein.  I highly recommend this book and for a bit more disturbing, yet equally enjoyable read, try Dan Brown's earlier work: Angels and Demons!
B00005Y7L4|4.0|Really a brillant film, but not really a suprise being based on a spectacular novel.  Okay, it's more violent then your typical film, it's also very entertaining and enlightening.  But more then anything &quot;Battle Royale&quot; is a very serious social commentary.  And it really has nothing to do with the fall of respect and order in social structure like some may think.  The most important key in the film is survival and trust.  These students are put in this extreme situation and each person reacts and adjust in a very different manner.  The novel and the film are in fact a social commentary on how our instinct will overcome every emotion when backed into a far enough corner.  Some of the scenes in the movie were just too perfect in depicting such a human trait.  I was really impressed with some of the things that happened in the movie.<br />Overall the acting is above average, nothing special, but then again good acting.  The direction of the film was great along with the great adaption to script.  I was a little disappointed with the ending, but it doesn't take away from the root of the film.  Already this film is being duplicated into other films.  Even Quentin Tarantino has stated that his feature &quot;Kill Bill&quot; has alot of influence from &quot;Battle Royale.&quot;  Surely to be classic in the coming years.<br />At the time of this review, &quot;Battle Royale&quot; does not have a US studio version of the film on dvd.  If you do buy this, be sure to get the double disc director's cut edition.  Unless you can speak fluent japenese, seeing as how many &quot;editions&quot; out there have terrible subtitling or sometimes none at all.
B0000DD7LC|5.0|Alicia Keys' sophomore album is as good as her first, maybe even better. Her songs are inspiring and real. &quot;Karma&quot; with words like &quot;what goes around comes around, what goes up must go down&quot; could trigger guilt, but could also trigger hope. &quot;You don't know my name&quot; shows the modernity of the times, with women making the first move BUT without taking her clothes off. Keys' lyrics are bold but so is the music. She mixes funk, hip-hop and r&amp;b harmoniously. This album proves that sophomore albums by young musicians could actually be as great as their first and that they could sell without selling themselves off.
B00000FCBC|5.0|&quot;Garage Inc.&quot; should be looked at in terms of each disc seperately. Disc 2 is everything that Metallica fans could want, since every song is fast and heavy, reminiscent of their 80's glory. The covers on Disc 2 have been heard before, because many of them are concert staples (&quot;So What&quot;, &quot;Last Caress&quot;, &quot;Stone Cold Crazy&quot;, &quot;Am I Evil?&quot;), but it is nice to have them all together on one disc, so it is no longer neccessary to dust off that old &quot;Garage Days&quot; tape. All the songs on this disc are solid, there is no doubt about that. Even fans who do nothing but complain about the direction the band has taken will like this. <br />Disc 1 is where the originality kicks in. Seems strange to call a disc of covers original, but Metallica manages to take each song and transform it enough from the original, that it could easily be considered a reinvention as opposed to a cover. The best track here is &quot;Astronomy&quot;, the original Blue Oyster Cult song. Beautiful melodies give way to the Metallica crunch that we all adore, and the song has the feel of an epic. Plus, the song ends with an amazing solo by Hammett. The courage of Metallica comes through in their decision to cover &quot;Loverman&quot;, a dark song from Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds. Hetfield sings this one amazingly, capturing enough of Cave and injecting some of his own style into the ominous lyrics. Songs like &quot;Die, die my Darling&quot; and &quot;It's Electric&quot; show that there still is no band that can touch these guys when it comes to energy, and anyone that has heard the original &quot;Die...&quot; by the Misfits will know exactly how much energy Metallica has pumped into this song. Another interesting one is &quot;Tuesday's Gone&quot;, the sad Lynyrd Skynyrd tune. Getting together with friends John Popper, Jerry Cantrell and Les Claypool for the acoustic sing along shows that Metallica still gets the respect it deserves from the musical community. This song is highlighted by a blazing harmonica solo from Popper, the lead singer from Blues Traveler. <br />&quot;Garage Inc.&quot; is very good, because it gives the speed and the fury for the fans who cannot face change, and the truly unique and original takes of somebody else's songs for those who enjoy watching this band grow, challenging themselves and their fans.
B000089RVX|1.0|Evanescence is the textbook example of a band becoming extremely popular only because they are shoved down the throats of all who watch MTV or listen to pop radio stations. Fortunately I don't watch MTV and rarely listen to the radio. The truth of the matter is the entire band is talentless. They peddle the same power cords and simple piano melodies in every song. The only bright spot is the lead singer who does manage to show that she does have some vocal talent. What she needs to do is drop the losers she's with and begin singing something that people might actually remember in 5 years. <br />&quot;Fallen&quot; is nearly your typical nu-metal offering in the same vein as Linkin Park except it lacks any of the hooks that made Linkin Park songs bareable. Save yourself some time and money and this one pass to the wayside of soon-to-be-forgotten over hyped pop music.
B0000CDLA7|5.0|As the rest of the contributors, I have been a fan of DT since I first heard Images &amp; Words.  The newest release, in my opinion, is the heaviest by far.  Only Awake rivals it.  If your a DT fan or not, you may want to check this out.<BR>  Several have said it mimics Metallica and some &quot;other&quot; bands.  I beg to differ.  This album is non-stop from beginning to end with the exception of a 2:50 song thrown in there to give them a rest !<BR>  As ususal, all members outdo themselves.  This CD is a must buy and look forward to the upcoming tour with no opening acts.  Finally, no one else to &quot;Take The Time&quot; away from the best band on the planet !
B00005B36H|3.0|Through it all Lateralus isn't a bad listen. It's very interesting at times. At times it's difficult to tell if Lateralus is nu-metal masquerading as prog rock or if it's prog rock masquerading as nu-metal. Overall, though, I think there's way too much filler on this album posing as art. Most of the songs are very simplistic (although the drummer manages to beat out some interesting rhythms at times). And nearly all of the times Maynard's lyrics remain in the realm of pseudo-intellectualism. He's definitely a competent vocalist but he's definitely no Yeats or Dylan Thomas when it comes to lyrics. This album is worth the purchase, but just barely.
B0000DD7NL|5.0|On the first hearing, I thought it good, but since then I've heard it a few more times and it gets better and better with each listen... I suggest putting the CD on shuffle to hear each and every song in a new and different way so as to keep your ears fresh to the soulful and artistic sounds of Ms. Alicia Keys' great follow-up work to her amazing first.
B000069CWE|3.0|The songs on this album sound quite different than their Hybrid Theory counterparts, and sometimes the difference is pleasant(some songs remind me of the good old days of old school hip hop). There are even remixed versions of songs that didn't make it onto their first Album. <br />But through it all, Reanimation is just another remix CD(maybe they took a page from NIN's book?), albeit a decent one. The songs on this CD have a much mor hip hop'ish feel to them, which some might enjoy, but I didn't. Most of the songs lacked the energy and hooks of the songs from Hybrid Theory. The result is a well-produced, but ultimately boring album. Unless you're a hardcore Linkin Park fan don't bother buying Reanimation.
B0000VCZK2|5.0|Ridley Scott's &quot;Alien&quot; is 2.35 anamorphic aspect ratio; James Cameron's &quot;Aliens&quot; is 1.85 anamorphic aspect ratio.  This has been listed incorrectly in the technical specifications of these movies.
B00008H2LB|2.0|Although not nearly as impressive as I was led to believe, Hybrid Theory was a wholly passable album from a new band. After several years I had expected Linkin Park to grow up a little and develop their skills. <br />If I didn't already know, however, I wouldn't be able to tell which came first, Hybrid Theory or Meteora, because they both sound so similar. The result is the same annoying angst-filled rap rock that I can only imagine appeals to ackward, socially-inept adolscents who haven't yet found a productive way to channel their teenage angst. <br />It's obvious that Linkin Park was too afraid to try anything innovative because they were afraid of losing their corporate sponsorship and all of their money, or because they simply lack the ability to create original music. Instead they decide to stick with and drain the life out of their tried and true formula. <br />Altogether this album ranks as poor in many different ways. If you're looking for music to &quot;rage against the machine&quot; with, look somewhere else. If you're looking for good metal, look somewhere else. If you're looking for good hip hop, look somewhere else. If you're looking for whiny, overly angst-filled, self-absorbed crap, then Meteora may be just what you're looking for.
B000002J20|5.0|I'm too tired right now to expound at length on  the reasons why I love this album so dearly. Suffice it to say that it is, in my opinion, the culmination of their collaborative creative genius.<br />I love almost everything Yes created in the 70's, but if I could only take one Yes album with me to a desert island, it would have to be &quot;Topographic Oceans&quot;. &quot;Close to the Edge&quot; and &quot;Going For The One&quot; would be close, and it would be hard not to have &quot;The Yes Album&quot;, &quot;Fragile&quot; or &quot;Relayer&quot; with me, but this one is Yes going all the way with their vision. All the way.
B00007L4MJ|5.0|This may very well be the most complete version of Metropolis since the film first debuted. I won't go into the plot, but after nearly 80 years Metropolis is still an engrossing film and good piece of sci-fi. The first hour of the film may cause some sleepiness but I promise you'll be captivated by the end.<br />The audio on the DVD is outstanding. 5.1 audio really manages to do the score justice.<br />The film is silent(no spoken dialogue), but character's emotions come through quite clearly if exaggerated. Inserted text fills the viewer in on the missing plot due to the still missing pieces of film.<br />The appearance of the film is great. The cinematography is amazing, the art deco is interesting, and the pyrotechnics are outstanding (for their time). Altogether Metropolis is a great movie and this is a great restoration of it. If you don't buy it at least find some way to view it.
B00006CXSS|5.0|This film ROCKS!the best war film i have ever seen the graphics are wicked
B0000640SB|4.0|Though the DVD version somewhat lacks the original film version still itis watchable. you get all  behind the scenes fact and figures.<br />  Agent &quot;K&quot;(tommy lee jones) is a member of secret agency that trys to keep people from finding about aliens.The organisation<BR>is called MIB or Men In Black.When he is searching for a partner he comes across a witty NYPD cop (will smith) and chooses him as his partner &quot;J&quot;.J's past is deleted from all records.Their job is to find and destroy a cockroach like alien who plans to start a war between aliens and humans.<br />  The movie moves in a pace that keeps you hooked.Will smith is simply wonderful.The movie is realy a hilarious one.At times you'll be laughing your head off.<br />   This movie is actually, based on a real-life unsolved mystery <BR>that claims that people who claim to have witnesed or experienced UFO or alien and stuff,were threatned by some mysterious men dressed in black suits .Sonnenfield has taken this theme for his movie and has won in it.All kinds of(sci-fi fans,action-buffs,UFO buffs,etc,.)people will love this movie.<BR>Donn't miss this one.
B00005JMF6|5.0|This is a definate pschological thriller!  Like sitting in the last car of the rollercoaster!  You may think you have this one figured out but it will keep you guessing until the end!
B0000C6E4D|4.0|The fifth cd from Sarah McLachlan is fairly similar to 1997's &quot;Surfacing&quot; and 1993's &quot;Fumbling Towards Ecstacy&quot;. This is what McLachlan does best--creating moody and introspective numbers ranging from the mid-tempo &quot;Fallen&quot;, &quot;Stupid&quot;, &quot;Perfect Girl&quot; to the more uptempo classics &quot;World On Fire&quot; and &quot;Train Wreck&quot;. This seems to be the same pattern she followed on &quot;Surfacing&quot;. The work on &quot;Afterglow&quot; is mature and thoughtful, something I can leave in my cd player all the time. It doesn't take great musical risks, but it delivers memorable and powerful music. I would have given this cd five stars, but I don't feel that it overshadows &quot;Fumbling Towards Ecstacy&quot;, which I think to be McLachlan's finest hour. I would like to see her take more musical risks in the future because she's already proven she can do the type of music on &quot;Afterglow&quot; extremely well.
B000002A46|5.0|This was one of the best Christmas CDs I have ever heard.  I thought the flow of the music and the sounds of the classics were both traditional and modern.  She did not take the true spirit of the origionals out with her unique style.
B0000E1WNV|4.0|It sure is a hell of a show.  What a crowd!  The camera work is first-rate and it's great that we get to see the show in its entirety.  But, it's a real shame that the sound mix is totally lacking in presence, like it was recorded halfway to the back of the hall. It almost sounds compressed. Bruce's vocals just don't pop out of the mix like they should.  Max Weinberg's powerhouse drumming is muffled.  The E Street Band in concert is like a roaring freight train, but the overall effect here is kind of mushy and restrained.  What happened?!  For a great live mix, check out the new U2 at Slane Castle.  Superlative sound!
B0000DZTIW|5.0|Hans zimmer brings another excellent piece of work.  Orchestration mixed with traditional japanese instruments and with a touch of synthesisers to bring this music alive.  All of the tracks are my favourite.  Highly recommended.  I personally like Red Warrior with the background chants. You can tell that there are some parts from his previous work such as the thin red line, gladiator? crimson tide etc... basically all his best ideas from previous work to create his best piece for a long time.  Get it if you like the Composer Hans Zimmer and his work
B00000JQFL|5.0|They don't make them like this anymore. EWF has always been known for their live performances. Unfortunately, hardly any were recorded in those days and even fewer video taped. Which makes this classic disc even more of a keeper. As always, let's look at it song by song:<BR>Intro/Medley (Africano/Power): This album was all about the excitement of being at a concert and that excitement starts from the very beginning. The crowd is cheering, overwhelmed by anticipation. MC Perry Jones announces them, \\"Presenting, Earth!...Wind!...and Fire! With that, the band comes in with that funky/jazz style that would later become their trademark. They launch into Africano first. In the midsection, the horns bellow out (literally) the intro to Power. The title fits the song, trust me. As usual, Verdine is really thumping that bass on this one. All in all, a great intro. Yearnin'and Learnin': One of my favorite songs by EWF and it's done even better live. During this time, the band had two drummers and if you listen closely, you can hear one set of drums in one speaker and the other set in the other speaker. The horns, always a strong point with EWF, really sour and bite hard on this one. Again, a great song made better live. Devotion: One of the more spiritual songs from the group, this song done live shows the communal part of an EWF show. When the ladies are singing \\"Yeah, yeah, yeah\\", it sounds like the ocean itself. Truly amazing. If you're a fan it makes you feel like you're there. If you're another musician, you envy it! Sun Goddess: This is a cut originally done with Ramsey Lewis, Maurices old stomping partner. Again, the sound of the crowd is as musical as the band itself. Larry Dunn's keyboard solo is great and just as good as Ramsey's original. Of course, Verdine just keeps rumbling along. Reasons: This live version I feel is one of the best songs of the 70's. The band is so much in sync, the crowd is again completly into it, and Philip Bailey's falsetto has never been better. Besides the the sax solo, which is grea, listen to the bass part. Verdine keeps it interesting to say the least. Sing A Message To You: This is a live interlude. It last about a minute and is repetitive but still cool. Check it out. Shining Star: Okay, I know I'm going to get it for this but.... this is probably my least favorite performance from the live set. Don't get me wrong, I love the song and think it's one of the best of the decade but in it's original studio form. Shining Star is such a studio creation that it just doesn't sound right outside of the studio. The best Shining Star live performance I've heard is on the EWF Greatest Hits Live disc but even that doesn't get a complete thumbs up from me. New World Synphony: This is a gift. From EWF to us, the listener. It is the best cut on the album. It shows the band as the jam session band that they were. It also shows the jazz influences they possessed. The last section is the best. Verdine White, or as he's known to his friends, the Fire, takes over on bass here with a lenthy solo that finnaly burst at th seams in the climax. But wait, that's not all! The band comes in to re-state what Verdine just did and finally the song is over. The cheers and screams heard at the end of this masterpiece is amazing. When Maurice says to the crowd \\"Can you say yeah?\\", they answer with a deafening sound. Again, a gift. Sunshine: A good, catchy pop song, with a great performance by Philip Bailey. Sing A Song: Another good pop tune with a sing-a-long type chorus. Nothing really special though. Gratitude: This is just low down funk. Verdine lays it down on the bass and Maurice takes care of the main vocals. Celebrate: Another funky yet eird tune about celebrating life in general. Chek it out and see what you think. Can't Hide Love: The best new song on the disc. Another gift from the elements. Maurices singing is awesome, Verdines bass intro is amazing and the horns, well, they're the EWF horns! The new CD includes a live set from a TV show but it pales to the concert. My only regret about this album is that the entire thing wasn't live. But if that was the case, we wouldn't have gotten Can't Hide Love in the package. So let's leave it like it is.
0345440900|5.0|I have 3 of my own children that I had no problem understanding from day one.  When my grandaughter was born within 6 weeks I was raising her and knew virtually nothing about her other than the weekends she had spent with us.  So, I thought I am basically an adoptive parent and there has to be books on this topic.  Well, my Chiropractor told me about this book.  It was amazing once I used the techniques.  Within 3 days, I knew exactly what my grandaughter needed and I felt much more secure in meeting her needs.  Now she is 5 months old, she is a happy baby that knows that Nana and Poppy will be there for her always.  We must learn to slow down and listen to our children, they are little people that have a lot to say if you listen. Must read for parents, grandparents and all caregivers!!  Thank you Tracy for teaching us to slow down and listen!!
0156907399|3.0|To the Lighthouse is a novel about a boy named James Ramsay who is growing up during World War I. &quot;The Window&quot; opens up by telling us how James longs to go to the lighthouse that is just across the sea. He hates his father because he takes joy in being rude to his eight children and his wife, Mrs. Ramsay who would not say a mean word about anyone.

Mr. Ramsay is proud of his sonbecause of person he came to be. Just as they arrive at the shore, Lily, the aspiring painter finishes one of her paintings. <BR>     I enjoyed this book overall. It was slow in the beginning but after the first few pages, I really came to enjoy reading it. It made me realize my life's worth even though my life has yet to start. No matter where it takes me, I now know to never give up and be persistent with what I like to do. If I continue on that path even with the bumps along the way, by the end my life with be put in perspective for me.
B000002UDB|5.0|A flawless Beatles album which wouldn't be such a surprise if it had been conceived as an album. The first six tracks (side one in the pre-CD era) are from the made for TV film that was deemed such a disaster by UK audiences that it never received an official US airing. Those songs were released as a set of two extended play 45s in the Beatles' native country, but Capital Records in America felt an LP offered greater commercial possibilities so they padded out the disc with five songs that had been released as singles earlier in the year. &quot;Strawberry Fields&quot; and &quot;Penny Lane&quot; were almost a year old by the time they appeared on this album, so it's no surprise some critics (and fans) felt this was a rip-off. It's hard to see it that way now, especially since the &quot;padding&quot; is as good, and possibly better, than the songs from the film that gave the album its title. This may not be an &quot;album&quot; in the usual sense, but song for song, I'll take this over &quot;Sgt. Pepper&quot; and &quot;Revolver&quot; any day.
B0000AQVCL|1.0|wow...<BR>what is the point of this band, what have they brought to music that has never been brought before?<BR>that's what i thought.<BR>playing-it-safe lyrics over predictable backdown guitar riffs stolen from all your favorite bands. <BR>they ride on the same wagon as the star spangles.<br />dont waste your money, be smart about it like me.
B0000DD7LC|4.0|This record is AMAZING! I'm lovin every bit of it. All types of emotions and vibes are set in this album. How ever it is you feel for a certain somebody...if you like a certain someone but you don't have a way of hookin up, YOU DON'T KNOW MY NAME...right now, I'm havin that feelin of wanting this guy..I could give him more than what his woman gives him, and because of this record OOoOOHh my gewdness!!! IT'S GONNA BE UNSTOPPABLE for real. OOHH!! It's EXCLUSIVE and I'm inspired :-) I love Alicia Keys more than before because her music has a connection towards my life. If you know what I'm feelin, than you got to get this album..It's hott!!!
B00005JMGC|2.0|Given my profound admiration of Julia Roberts and my enthusiasm for material that provides thoughtful insight into the shallowness of so much that seems to constitute the American Dream, it may come as some surprise that I am so critical of this movie.  In fact, all that I can find to compliment are the stunning skills of Julia Roberts, convincing as always--so much so that you forget you are watching her and actually believe in the person she portrays, and the intent of the screenplay writer, admirable in its correct depiction of an educational institution devoted to a purpose so devoid of any real meaning.<br />Unfortunately, the skills of the director, and perhaps of the screenwriter as well have limited the actual film to an almost ludicrously two dimensional portrayal of virtually all the characters in the movie, and have created a story so hyperbolic in nature as to render the plot comedy at times when it should be serious and pathetic at times when it pretends to humour.  In the opening scene we are supposed to believe that every student in this fine university have acually read and mastered the assignment for the first class in its entirety, memorizing to perfection dates and styles of art going back to the 15th century BC.<br />Later, we are expected to believe that the Italian Professor (Mike Newell) who has exhibited absolutely nothing in the film worthy of the attentions of the thinking, caring, highly intellectual professor which is Katherine Watson, succeeds not only in seducing her but in further maintaining a relationship lasting for a period of several months.<br />Finally, we are expected to believe that Betty (Kirsten Dunst) who has consistently been portrayed as the acquiescing member of high society, consistently scornful, indeed derisive of her professor suddenly becomes her ardent admirer and is willing to turn to her for support and advice just because she has given up on her marriage and broken bonds with her domineering mother.  Possible, yes, but the film here, as in so many other scenes, fails to provide any transitional material explaining the change in attitude or behaviour.<br />The one sequence that most significantly varies, refreshingly, from this is that where Joan (Julia Stiles) boldly challenges Katherine's (Julia Roberts) teaching as that of imposing her own values on others rather than that which she claims to be doing--teaching students to find their own way.<br />To be certain, taken on the strength of their individual performances, there were a number of reasonably good appearances by key actors and actresses.  There were a few good scenes in the movie and its fundamental message was one with which many of its viewers will be no doubt inclined to agree.  Unfortunately, only one performance could be described as brilliant (that of the inimitable Julia) and the film as a whole bears no comparison with the likes of Mr. Holland's Opus, a masterpiece of drama, believable, human and multidimensional throughout.  Alas, this could have been such a rich fabric of natural fibers rather than the plastic imitation that it is.
B00003CXAE|4.0|Never in my life will I say that Grease is the best musical I have ever watched to, but it is really cool. I think it is famous just for the great music that it has, because the end of the film is obvious, everybody who saw it knows that in the end Danny will be with Sandy. The actors are not so good either, but they can sing very well and dance too. The plot portrays the life style of teenagers that have a free life, without trouble like school or parents, just doing things that the society thinks that are wrong. On the other hand, everybody knows Grease, it is a classic, ask your parents and friends, everybody knows that wonderful film.
B00005JMCW|4.0|I had been looking forward to seeing this for months. I love Jamie Lee Curtis and was excited to hear that she was playing the role of the mother in thsi film loosely based on the 70's original with Jodie Foster. The film starts off slow, but gets better fast with plenty of funny moments and excellent acting from the cast. They're very believable. <br />The plot is based around a mother who is about to get married and her rebellious, punk-ish daughter who happen to switch places thanks to an Asian curse placed on them. They then discover that each others lives wasn't as easy as I thought. Great modern re-make. Funny, but not at all vulgar. Great for any age.
B0000DD7NL|5.0|The Diary of Alicia Keys is, in a word, stunning!  The musicality on this album is out of this world.  The songs have a 70's throwback feel to it.  It's unlike anything you've heard this year.  The best songs are Diary, Dragon Days, When You Really Love Someone, So Simple and Feeling U Feeling Me.  This is a very strong piece of work and deserves all accolades it is destined to earn.
B000002HMH|1.0|This CD has to be the biggest pice of sh*t i have ever heard in my entire life. I am a die hard Metallica fan and saw them live not to long ago. They didn't play anything off this CD so the must think its f*cking sucks to. WHAT HAPPEND TO THE GOOD OLD METALLICA!!!!!
B00005YW4H|5.0|THIS CD IS WONDERFUL! Every song has a meaning and if you really listen to the words you will be pleasantly surprised. Her voice is so sultry it makes her songs perfect for a rainy day when you are stuck inside. I personally love to listen to it while my candles are lit and the bubbles are piled high in the jacuzzi tub! A definite must buy...
B000053VAF|5.0|how does he come up with this stuff? this is by far my favorite movie.  its funny, but it also makes you think about life.  if you havent seen this i DEFINITELY reccomend seeing it A.S.A.P.  if i were you i'd just buy it now because after you see it you will anyway
B0000DD7NL|5.0|I Love I Love I Love This album. When i hear this, i hear Stevie wonder- Fulfilingness' First Finale, Marvin Gaye, Donny Hathaway ETC. Just Think, She's Only 23. Can you Imagine What She Will Sound Like When She's 33....... WOW!!!!<br />  Peace To You Alicia
0446678430|4.0|This was a great book for me because I am very good at SAVING money, though not very good at spending it. This book changed how I thought about what it meant to be rich. Some of the richest people I know do not work very hard. There is a reason for this, and the author explains this in a way that will get through any thick skull. I began to read this book less than one month ago, and have already stretched to purchase rental property that will soon be profitable. Though it isn't totally comfortable (or in my &quot;reality&quot; as the author explains), I am convinced it is the best way to achieve financial independence and work now toward working LESS in the future. I thank the book for this confidence.<br />A few notes about Robert's writing: if you are looking for a book that defines a &quot;recipe for success&quot;, this is not it. If you're looking for an eloquently written book, this is definitely not it. BUT...this book explains, sometimes philosophically, what it means to have other people's money work for YOU and for YOU to control when and how you pay your taxes. He makes many references to other books in the Rich Dad series (which I have not read), but summarizes those references so you aren't lost as to what he is talking about. He gives many examples from he and his wife's life in where their decisions have taken them. He DOES NOT tell you to go out and buy A, B, or C. Those are for you to determine based on the lessons.<br />This books sticks in my head throughout the day, and in my decisions about spending, investing, saving, and working. I am thirty years old, single, and feel like this book was some of the best money I spent, and even better that I did not wait ten years, or until I was married, or even until tomorrow, to learn these lessons. <br />Highly recommended by this reader!
B0000B1OFL|5.0|The scenery of Venice Italy is great . The Players in the movie are really good and the story line is quite intresting have to say . I really enjoyed this movie . Mark Walberg is funny and Charlize Theron is really good as well . My Aunt got me to see this movie on VHS I still liked it !!
B0000DD7LB|1.0|If I could give it \\"0\\" stars, I would.<br />The only reason Britney Spears sells CD's is because of her sex appeal. Period. Britney couldn't carry a tune with a bucket. <br />If Madonna didn't appear on one of these tracks, \\"Me against the Music\\", I wonder what kind of debut this CD would have had. It is terrible.<br />The nice thing is, Amazon allows you to listen to a few tracks before you waste your money. And waste your money you would, should you purchase this piece of garbage.<br />The songs on this CD are as over-processed as Velveeta cheese. Britney's voice is easily overwhelmed (which isn't necessarily a bad thing considering her voice is terrible) by the background \\"music\\". Her lyrics are impossible to make out as well(again, not necessarily a bad thing because Ms. Spears' song writing skills are almost as bad as her voice).<br />Britney's image is sexy; no doubt about it. Her videos, which consistently hit the number one spot on MTV's request show, are filled with sexual innuendos and some not so subtle sexual messages. Which is why they hit the number one spot.<br />Sexy or not, this broad can not sing. Why is she so popular? Well, like I said, appeal. The media is so hung up on appearances and body image....Britney's fan base consists mainly of pre-teen girls who idolize her for her looks, body, glamourous life style, etc. These are the people buying her CD's.<br />Here is one thing that I can guarentee you with 99.9% certainty. If Britney was a fat woman with braces, but had the exact same voice, she wouldn't have gotten a record deal. She would have been the laughing stock of every record label that listened to her demo.<br />Do yourself a favor. Listen to the tracks here on Amazon and then make your decision whether or not to purchase this CD. Chances are you will decide against it.
B0000DZEA1|5.0|Waaaaaay better than TTT.  It nearly ties with LTR1.  What I noticed about this soundtrack is that it was brighter and had more distinctive melodies than the other scores Shore has composed.  The gorgeous solo instruments, the intense orchestration--this one's a winner!<br />Some great tracks:  Track 4 &amp; track 5.  Listen to track 5 (&quot;Steward of Gondor&quot;) just to hear Billy Boyd (&quot;Pippin&quot;) sing.  Kid's got a nice voice.  Track 4 is my favorite because of the strong melody in the bass, backed up by violins going crazy with arpeggios.  I love it!  love it love it.<br />If the Academy Awards weren't rigged, &quot;Return of the King&quot; would win an Oscar for best film score.  It certainly deserves it, as it is the best I've heard all year.<br />One last note:  I thought the last track, &quot;Into the West&quot;, was rotten.  Sounds like a badly-sung southern rendition of &quot;Riverdance&quot;.  Very un-lord-of-the-ringsy.  Good thing the other tracks are absolutely stupendous.  (And I still think &quot;In Dreams&quot; is the best song of the trilogy.)<br />Good soundtrack.  Get it.  Listen to it.  Love it.
B0000DJZA5|3.0|Let me set some parameters here. A) I am a die-hard Beatles fan. B) Digital technology has opened the doors and C) a re-evaluation of LIB is way overdue.  Now, given this, why didn't the powers that be release a true overview of the entire session? The versions here (with the exception of Don't Let Me Down and Across the Universe) are not really that different from anything else that is already out there. (I am including bootlegs, Anthology, etc.) I mean the sessions lasted a good month and the Beatles poured over lots of stuff (including versions of songs that they previously recorded) so why don't they put the stuff out (ok, the listenable stuff) and digitally enhance it?  We need the DVD movie version of LIB, this could have been all rolled out simultaneously.  The extra &quot;fly on the wall&quot; disk was ok, however, if you are like me you have heard most of the stuff before. We want to hear more of IT, not cleaner versions of already existing stuff. Finally, the album is nice to listen to and does &quot;crank&quot; in spots. Hey, I'm a Beatles fan-atic so I plunked down the 13$. I might be a little more leery next time and listen to it in the store first.
6303471714|4.0|Because of this workout, I have developed a bad back- and I'm only fifteen! I can't and don't want to do this tape ever again because ever since the first time I used it a year ago, my back hasn't been the same. Besides that, the workout is pretty well structured with Cindy's trainer, Radu. It's filmed in multiple settings like the beach, in a studio, on a rooftop... Some of it is in black and white and there are multiple songs throughout the workout. Overall, both workouts remind you of an early '90s music video. Oh yeah, there are three workouts. The first two are about 45 minutes and the third is a 10 minute &quot;Jump-Start Mini-Workout&quot;. There isn't enough upper body toning for me and because it's focused on speed for cardio benefit, the weights used are only five pounds. I like the video overall but it unfortunately killed my back.
B0000VCZK2|5.0|The Alien Quadrilogy set, is, by and large, the best, most feature-laden set you've ever seen. To keep it brief, if you are a casual fan of the Alien films, you are probably perfectly safe keeping your original Alien Legacy set. The overall quality of the picture and sound on the original set was basically the same as the Quadrilogy versions, with the exception of some added commentaries, new footage on films 1,3 and 4, and 2 new DTS soundtracks (Alien and Alien Res). The real reason to justify spending the simolians IMO is the incredible amount of documentary content. The length and quality of the documentaries is beyond belief. Far exceeding the length of the films they are about, the making of features exceed even the extended Lord Of The Rings sets for thoroughness. I realise I am probably not representative of most people here, but I personally love documentaries, good ones anyway, and I often watch certain DVD documentaries more often than I watch the movies themselves, so for me, it was more than worth the investment. If you are a commentary and documentary fan, this set is worth every penny. Only 2 complaints here, 1 small and on pretty darn big:<br />The minor niggle I have with this set is the stupid packaging. The set looks terriffic, with great art and the spindles hold the discs firmly. The problem is the box unfolds accordian style to over 5 feet in length. If you just want to see disc 9, it's a real operation and a pain in the neck. Whoever designed this thing never thought of mobile dvd watchers that's for sure. The 1 severe drawback, and to me inexcusable, is the transfer quality of the Aliens disc. While Alien 1,3 and 4 all have beautiful, razor-sharp video transfers, Aliens looks only slightly better than a VHS cassette. I watched the first 2 movies right in a row upon getting the set, and I couldn't believe how much worse Aliens looked than the first film...and it is 7 years newer!? Let's face it. The vast majority of fans are really only interested in the first two movies and it's really hard to believe that they couldn't find a better telecine master for arguably the most popular movie in the set. With that aside, this is an awsome set assured to keep you busy with the features for days, if not weeks, and should be the last time you will ever need to buy the Alien films...until the super-duper actually remastered version of Aliens comes out. And the set is redone in High defintion in a few years...and when they do the 30 th anniversery edition......
B00005NP04|5.0|Martina McBride is one of the best vocalists of any genre and country music is very lucky to have her. Her Greatest Hits CD is awesome. There are 17 of her chart hits:<BR>My Baby Loves me, Life #9, Independence Day, Safe In The Arms Of Love, Wild Angels, Valentine, A Broken Wing, Happy Girl, Wrong Again, Whatever You Say, I Love You, Love's The Only House, There You Are, When God Fearin' Women Get The Blues, Where Would You Be, Concrete Angel, and Blessed.<BR>There is also a fan favorite but unreleased song called Strangers and the intro to When God Fearin' Women Get The Blues. Included in the liner notes are Martina and the producer's thoughts and comments on each song. They talk about what they would change, their initial reaction to the demos, etc. This CD is a must-have even if you're not familiar with Martina's music. She is just as good if not better than Whitney Houston. And Mariah Carey's overrated, no good, hoarse singing can't even begin to compare to the passion and range of Martina. Martina McBride's Greatest Hits definitely deserves five stars!
B0000AXE8I|5.0|it seems like the reviewers of this movie feel like they are owed an enlightenment for their 6 dollars and 2 hours of their life. pander to me! entertain me! enlighten me! this and that and this was wrong! too little talking! too much talking!  a shame, i could do better!<br />      oh, how easy it is to complain. it is incredible how many people trash this movie! you know, there are over 2 billion people in the world that dont know what this movie is, and just want to have some food to eat. maybe next time you should take your 6 dollars and help save a child in a third world country who doesnt give a f_ck about how a multi million dollar special effects extravaganza that did not meet their expectations. perhaps this does not apply to you, but this is where it stands. we are a bunch of whiny spoiled brats.
1573301043|4.0|Celine Dion is definitely the biggest highlight from the first ever Divas Live. Her solo performances of River Deep, Mountain High and My Heart Will Go On are impeccable. Everyone agrees that her My Heart Will Go On performance on this show is one of her best and most memorable yet. She also does The Reason with Carole King. Shania Twain performing Man!I Feel Like A Woman! and You're Still The One also contributes to making this show better than it would have been with incredibly mediocre Gloria Estefan, incredibly annoying Mariah Carey, and incredibly over hyped Aretha Franklin. MARIAH CAREY IS NOT A GREAT SINGER!!!!!!!!<BR>It was awesome to see Celine rightfully upstage Aretha in the finale. Classic. Aretha may be the Queen Of Soul(ick) but Celine Dion is the Queen of ALL singers! The Canadians rule the day here, folks!

1400034205|5.0|It has been said that a young man should not read Somerset Maugham too early in life, lest he be ruined, and The Razor's Edge is a tremendous example of the truth behind that aphorism.<br />The search for understanding is one we all yearn to undertake, but Larry Darrell serves as an example that what we want in life we may not necessarily get.  It's a hard lesson we think we understand, but it is not until the vast torrent of life washes the lesson over us that we truly realize just how insignificant we are.<br />Although the narrative device of author/uncle does weaken this book, it would be hard to imagine it written with such power in any other way.<br />A must read for anyone who longs to understand our place in existence.
B0000DD7LC|5.0|In a world saturated by pop artist destined to appeal to minors, it's reasuring to have artist bless us with music that is not only original but extraordinary in the eyes of true music lovers.  It usually takes time for a cd to become on my A-list but this CD is very addictive.
B000065VB9|4.0|Peter Gabriel's third self-titled album is often considered a rock masterpiece by his fans (just check out the reviews on this page), but although it was the first truly unified work of his solo career in both music and lyric, there remained a few kinks that would not be ironed out until the next effort &quot;Security&quot; (his true magnum opus).  There are certainly a host of classics on this effort, which exude a truly chilling feel of isolation, terror and psychosis: with its cymbal-less drums and metallic reverb, &quot;Intruder&quot; basically ushered in the 80s, although its avant-garde construction is a far cry from the simplistic dance-pop that would eventually rule the decade. &quot;No Self Control&quot; is a similarly twisted look into the psyche, while the quiet &quot;Lead A Normal Life&quot; masks the eerie tale of an inmate.  The closing &quot;Biko&quot; is still a majestic anthem after all these years, with a chanted chorus that may bring tears to the eyes; its world-music dabblings would also foreshadow the direction he would take for the rest of his career.  <br />In spite of its many achievements, &quot;Melt&quot; was not entirely free of the pop/rock filler that had surfaced on his first two solo efforts.  &quot;And Through The Wire&quot; and &quot;Not One Of Us&quot;, while energetic, aren't particularly interesting melodically or rhythmically.  &quot;I Don't Remember&quot; is an otherwise-great single marred by some dated synth effects (the album's pioneering 80s sound working both for and against it these days).  On the other hand, the other single &quot;Games Without Frontiers&quot; manages to use its drum-machine groove to highlight a blackly humorous tale of <BR>global competitiveness, inspired by a then-popular UK game show. <br />Compared to most other artists, Gabriel's lyrical depth, innovative arrangements and powerful vocals combined to create <BR>a work which fused the catchy, energetic New Wave sound of its time with dark, edgy art-pop touches.  Yes, it was a long way from Genesis, although the connections between, say, &quot;Back In NYC&quot; and &quot;No Self Control&quot; weren't so wide after all, and I enjoy both with equal measure.  Genius is genius, no matter what genre it is couched in, and Gabriel's achievement has been to move forward into pioneering new vistas of sound and style while still retaining an identifiable character that is uniquely his.
0385504209|4.0|Although I did thoroughly enjoy reading The Da Vinci Code, with its twists and turns, I found Dan Brown's book &quot;Angels and Demons&quot; to be far superior.  Having read it prior to reading The Da Vinci Code, it's interesting and intriguing to see some of the themes intertwine between the two novels.  The Da Vinci Code is certainly worth reading, but do yourself a favor and read &quot;Angels &amp; Demons&quot;.
B000065V9Y|5.0|Forget the amazon reviewer above who labels this one &quot;So-lite&quot;:<BR>&quot;Us&quot; is a much deeper, heavier album than &quot;So&quot; on so many levels, that reveals new textures with repeated listens.  Songs like &quot;Come Talk To Me&quot;, &quot;Blood Of Eden&quot; and &quot;Only Us&quot; are absolutely haunting in their ethereal beauty, aided by guest vocalist Sinead O'Connor and a typically innovative production that combined the pop sound of &quot;So&quot; with the transcendent world-music atmospherics of &quot;Passion&quot;.  The instrumental break in &quot;Come Talk To Me&quot; is one of the most breathtaking in his entire career, while the chorus to &quot;Blood Of Eden&quot; sounds as if it were composed centuries ago.  Although the critics may have been disappointed, Gabriel fans both hardcore and casual consider it one of his very best, for being one of his most heartfelt and personally introspective works.<br />Other highlights include the abrasive single &quot;Digging In The Dirt&quot; (with a vocal as frightening as that in &quot;Shock The Monkey&quot;), the &quot;Passion&quot;-like meditation &quot;Fourteen Black Paintings&quot; and the exuberant &quot;Secret World&quot;, which closes the work on a hopeful note and became a stage favorite.  The only weaker moments, in fact, are those which try a bit too hard to echo &quot;So&quot;--ie. &quot;Steam&quot; and &quot;Kiss That Frog&quot;--although even these feature clever wordplay and catchy choruses, and act as a necessary breather in the midst of the slower pace and heavy psychoanalysis of the rest of the album.  <br />&quot;Us&quot; is Gabriel at his absolute best, second perhaps only to &quot;Security&quot; in his pantheon of solo works.  The pace may be much slower than most of his other albums but this creates a sustained mood that is nonetheless never boring. It is an album many have identified with (especially those who have been through a breakup), and it cuts right through the soul with a fierce beauty.  It is also probably the most effective combination of world-music and pop ever produced, although its followup &quot;Up&quot; is also superb and highly recommended.  Compared to &quot;Us&quot;, &quot;So&quot; is Gabriel-lite!
0399103422|5.0|Until the death of Santino, the story was a perfect piece. Mario Puzo was a master thriller. he recalls my memories of the critically aclaimed James Hadley Chase of blessed memory. an auther with the art of suspension in literary fiction. the godfather showcases the fight for power between sicily rival groups based in the states. the struggle for power is the only means of survival of the fittest in puzo's fictious work. santino was assassinated by the rival due to annoyance and mike was to take the throne of don.<br />The Don became seriously ill after the death of santino who was supposed to take over from him. his reappearances was for a change. the book was perfectly written, it thrills the reader making him want to read the book over again a million times. its a book not  worthy to be compared as far as crime is concerned. it masterminds the sicilian landmark, and how the italians invaded the casinos and gambling businesses in las vegas, chicago, texas, before moving into the shores of new york.<br />here only the strongest survives, and you keep by the rules of the game. the rules are never broken, they are only bend a little if need be. there is no other was out, the only available option for a failed job is death, no mercies. the don set a procedures for all the sicilian who came to america for drug deals and money business. but it was a strickly two family in the battle field.<br />the don knows everything in the deal and he dont make mistakes, he lives by the rules. but when santino died and mike came home, the don saw the need to bring mike closer to take up the throne because the latter was wise and soft and the former was hot and stronger, but he broved that wisdom is a better strenght.<br />Mario Puzo was damn too good to put up such a thriller piece. it reminds me of &quot;This way for a shroud&quot; pls. go check that out, its a chase piece and his only book that saw the culprit going free. i am enthusiastically grateful belonging to the readers of such a marvelous work of art, though its a fiction, but the suspense can keep you all the way through. and pls. becareful or else you will get knockoff while on it. its a must read for crime lovers. its an action parked thriller. i never could have put it down even once, i didnt even remeber closing any of its pages, its just as marvelous as the movie &quot;face-off&quot; with extreme actions even as a book. i can vote it to replace mom's delicious meal for me, but its more than a lunch. go get a copy or you are missing one of the greatest fiction on this planet. remember i told you what mom never did!
B000066NW0|1.0|Avril Lavigne is the britney spears of pop punk, and this is still another disaster that the music industry has been putting on us since kurt nobrain ruined rock, songs are stupid, dull writing and idiotic singing<BR>This album and this singer is a waste
B0000074Q9|4.0|I still enjoy listening to Balance, even though it is a few years old. Somehow learning to play the songs right along with listening to it adds depth. It is a shame thought that the extra track &quot;crossing over&quot; was left off the US release. Buying the japaneese release tends to be difficult if not expensive. If you liked the &quot;best of&quot; releases that Van Hagar did with the twister soundtrack then the extra track is right along those lines. Crossing over has the dark sound that I like from Humans Being, with the feeling of Respect the Wind. Music like this puts to shame most of the new stuff coming out from other &quot;flavor of the month&quot; bands out there. A true classic in its own right.
0385504209|4.0|Dan Brown's fast-paced novel has all the thrills of a roller coaster packed into one book. It combines mystery, suspense, and history into one interesting literary work. Unlike ordinary, whodunit mysteries, The Da Vinci code gives historical information about Da Vinci, symbolism, and Christianity, while at the same time forming a complex plot. The novel makes the reader alert because of its numerous intriguing details.  It tells the story of Robert Langdon, a Harvard profesor of symbolism, and Sophie Neveu, a police agent, who are chosen to solve a murder mystery and find the Holy Grail.  Sophie's grandfather is murdered in a museum and he leaves behind complex clues for Sophie and Langdon to find the Holy Grail.  Many plot twists occur, including secret societies, shocking religious information, and details about Sophie's family.  If you want a unique mystery novel filled with surprises, then Dan Brown's The Da Vinci Code is a perfect choice.
0316666343|5.0|The Lovely Bones by Alice Sebold is a very touching, suspenseful novel about a young girl who's murdered.  This was an astounding book which I extremely enjoyed.  Sebold was able to write about a terrible tragedy and in the end leave a smile on your face.  The theme of this book shows how a family restores their lives after being devastated.  Susie's character is very strong-willed and mature.  She is very selfless, being more concerned about her family than herself and hoping they will be able to move on with their lives and function as a family once again. <BR> <BR>The theme of this book also shows how people are very individual in how they grieve and adjust to terrible experiences.  Susie watches her family, from up in heaven, try to coup and understand the devastating news.  The images and feelings you get when reading this novel are so realistic.  Although this story is fiction, what happens to Susie is a common event that you hear in the news all the time.  It is easy to relate this story to everyday life.  <br />Susie narrates the novel by telling the reader events that happened before her death showing how her family was when she was still alive.  This helps us to see the progress her family makes in accepting her death throughout the novel.  In the novel Ruth Connors believes the dead truly talk to us, stating \\"That in the air between the living, spirits bob and weave and laugh with us.  They are the oxygen we breathe.\\"  I like that quote because I also believe the living have connections with the dead and although its sad to lose a loved one, I like to think they are always with you in spirit.  Although this book is about a very sad tragedy it shows the good points about it and shines light on a `bad' situation.
B00006CXSS|5.0|First, comments on &quot;Ian of Wakefield&quot; and his detractors:  I think the mostly vitriolic replies he's received show that he has a point.  What kind of person would want &quot;5 minutes alone with [Ian} so [he] could give [Ian] a savage beating&quot;?  Imagine, as another reviewer has, of defending the necessity of war by bringing up the concept of &quot;Holy War.&quot;  Yup, the Crusades and religion-driven terrorism are the models we want.<br />Yet given this defense of Ian's point of view, I have to say Band of Brothers is an *excellent* series to view as a commemoration of what soldiers in WWII had to go through, and it also can help one to *reflect* on war and its consequences, whether you're a hawk or dove.<br />As other reviewers have noted, BoB is amazingly well made and quite faithful to Ambrose's book.  It takes a lot of the film techniques employed in &quot;Saving Private Ryan&quot; (hand held cameras, desaturating the color in some of the shots to make the scene feel more grim) to bring the shocking reality of war closer to the screen, and yet, the miniseries format allows the series to focus better on the soldiers of Easy company.  The characters come to the forefront and the special effects become a supporting player as they should be.  The series brings excellent filmmaking to the service of witnessing to these men's memories. <br />From time to time (such as in the &quot;Why We Fight&quot; episode) there is an editorial slant towards putting the action in the context justifications for the war.  However, the main strength of this series over nearly all other war movies (over Saving Private Ryan especially) is its &quot;you are there&quot; perspective with comparatively little editorializing.  Here it is:  a chronicle of a group of soldiers' experiences.  You'll get a glimpse into the bonds between them that helped them survive, the heroics that events seemed to summon up from so many of the soldiers, and also their suffering.<br />Where to gofrom there is up to you.  Are there better &quot;investments&quot; to make with such suffering and gallantry than war?  Does sympathy with such soldiers mean that anti-war activists must be pummelled for their supposed dishonor?  Yes, war will always be with us.  But so too will heroism and self-sacrifice.  I can think of no better way of honoring the sacrifices Capt. Richard Winters and Easy Company made than to watch the series and make a commitment to thinking about our ideas and images of war and sacrifice--specifically whether we're fighting the right wars and making the correct sacrifices.  Just because our servicemen are willing to risk their lives to defend our nation doesn't mean that all wars justify their sacrifices.
B000002KDI|5.0|_Live Rust_ was the second part of Neil Young's late Seventies comeback, released just a few months after _Rust Never Sleeps_.  I usually consider it a bookend to his first best-of package, _Decade_, instead; they both mark the finale of an epoch in his career.  They also display Young's astonishing stylistic breadth, though _Live Rust_ is all solo Neil-no CSNY or Buffalo Springfield material is included.<br />The opening acoustic numbers are agreeably pastoral, a sensitive farewell to his folkie days.  The next batch of songs is singer-songwriter soft rock, like &quot;Lotta Love&quot;, and straight-ahead rockers like the hilarious &quot;Sedan Delivery&quot;.  &quot;Cinnamon Girl&quot; is considerably loosened up, given a rollicking treatment, compared to the stiff studio version.<br />Tracks 10-16 (which used to be sides three and four of the lp) are dense clouds of black guitar noise, which part occasionally to give glimpses of dizzying vistas.  It represents a pinnacle of Young's achievement as one of the very greatest rockers of the 1970s.  Twelve years later, on _Weld_, he could only manage to serve up lots more of the same, but didn't move a foot beyond it, so complete was the earlier triumph.  Indeed, without the variety and buildup of tension on _Live Rust_, _Weld_ comes off as rather sludgy.  I kept unfavorably comparing my copy of _Weld_ to _Live Rust_ so much that I eventually traded it in.<br />Neil Young is one of those artists whose albums can justly be viewed as events, and _Live Rust_ is a major one.  If you only know him from his grungy Nineties days, this and _Decade_ are the next albums to get.
B000092ZYX|4.0|First up: While I greatly enjoy them, I am not a rabid Radiohead fan - this may offset some of you, but Oh Well.  <br />That being said, I do feel that Radiohead will be seen as one of the most important bands of the late 90's/early 00's, standing next to Wilco and the Flaming Lips in regard to their drive to continually explore the definition of what music is today.  As important as U2 was during it's prime, which is amazing considering how little airplay their albums TRULY get (come'on, other than a few singles, their library is probably one of the least played on commercial radio). <br />Why is this so?  Like Wilco, Radiohead has taken to experimenting with music.  You can also trace the evolution from the 'great within its framework' The Bends to the first experimentation in 'OK Computer' to continued evolution/progression in 'Kid A' &amp; 'Amnesiac'.  The move from radio friendly 'alt-rock' (nowdays, a complete oxymoron) to truly progessive, challenging music has left the airwaves with a few singles appropriate for airplay.  So much the better.  <br />Many have said it, and I agree with it - this album represents an attempt to meld the so called 'New Radiohead' with the 'return to basics/The Bends' Radiohead.  On that level, it is largely successful.  The juxtaposition of 'Backdrifting' with 'Go to Sleep' is the perfect example of old and new.  And on this album, some of the new, to me, are so different to be unsettling - 'Myxomatosis' and 'The Gloaming' need patience.  <br />However, what seemingly done to appease both groups does not a consistent album make.  Unlike 'Kid A' and 'OK Computer' the album does not have a center, an anchor point.  It moves between to foci, keeping you somewhat offbalance.  This can make for interesting listening, but mildly detracts from the overall ambience.  Or perhaps that is exactly what Yorke &amp; company were shooting for?
1567184855|5.0|If you are really open and curious about life after death issues, read this book.  Although it is based on deep-trance hypnotic techniques, with the inherent less rigour than NDE studies, it attempts a good general picture of what awaits us whence we drop our mortal coil.<br />It doesn't espouse religion, but it does threaten religious presuppositions. If you are not open to potentially life-changing ideas, then don't bother.  It wouldn't interest you anyway.
B0000A1RJI|5.0|This is truly a great film score. As others have allueded to it's is reminiscent of some of Hans Zimmer's work particularly Gladiator and Crimson Tide. The score for the action sequences are powerful, moving, and dark while the themes for the love scenes are passionate and flowing. The two contrasts provide for a great soundtrack bound to please all.
B0000E1WKE|5.0|The CD is wonderful, I must have listened to it over 20 times already.  Her voice is clear and filled with passion.
B000089RVR|4.0|a lovely album with hypnotic vocals and lyrics that are gradually evolving into something substantial. Though I'm mystified that most of those who love Enya and Dido never really gave Cocteau Twins a chance, I must say that I, too, have been swept up by these ethereal &quot;pop&quot; sounds (which at least offer more than most of the other stuff on American radio).<br />For female vocals that continue to move the soul, I also recommend Sarah Brightman, Lisa Gerrard &amp; PJ Harvey.
B00005JLXE|1.0|I think I should address the few good things about this movie:    GOOD THING #1: Numero uno would be David Keith's portrayal of Jack Murdock, Matt's boxer father. No longer sporting the lanky build we saw in An Officer and a Gentleman, in the intervening 20 years it looks like Keith has put on 100 pounds, most of it muscle. He was just perfect as the big, beefy Irish brawler.    GOOD THING #2: The scene where Matt uses his radar sense to \\"see\\" Elektra's face in the rain was just beautiful, so well and sensitively done it seemed to have wandered in from another movie.    A MAJOR MISSED OPPORTUNITY: In the transition from comic to movie, Matt's origin was changed from heroically pushing a blind man out of the path of a speeding truck, from which fell a radioactive isotope, striking him across the eyes, blinding him and granting him super-senses. (Appreciate the irony: saving a blind man turns this heroic boy into a blind man himself.) In the movie there's no heroism involved, he simply runs into a spray of toxic waste.    Later in the movie the newly \\"blinded\\" Matt stops a man from stepping out into the path of a speeding car. He raises his cane across the man's path because obviously he \\"saw\\" the car coming when the sighted man did not - and because, in this movie, Matt cares not a whit, apparently, then or later, for hiding the fact he's not an ordinary blind man. In fact, he flaunts the fact. The man he stops from being run over is played by Stan Lee, Daredevil's creator back in 1964.    So we have a grossly altered origin leeching from it any hint of heroism, and a throwaway moment with Daredevil's creator that underlines how lightly Matt takes the \\"secret\\" of his powers. What if, instead, they'd taken the best of those two ideas, the origin of DD's powers and Stan Lee's cameo role? We have the scene where Matt's racing to save a blind man from an onrushing truck....AND THE BLIND MAN WAS STAN LEE. Creation saves creator, in the live action version of the origin scene Lee wrote 39 years before. That's just....perfect.    What might have been.
B00000099Y|5.0|Good vocals, good lyrics, good singer. Superb production of drums by Canada's own David Botrill. This album is a must have and is probably one of the most disturbing albums alongside Soundgarden's Supeunknown. This band is not cheesy and makes Marilyn Manson look like a joke. Don't take it the wrong way, i still don't mind Marilyn Manson, but Maynard's voice haunts me more. You should hear their cover of Led Zeppelin's &quot;No Quarter&quot;, it sounds like an original Tool song! That's how good they are.
0872860175|5.0|I used to think that people didn't read things like &quot;Howl&quot; because they didn't understand.  But as I have grown older I've come to the realization that is has much more to do with their NOT wanting to understand.  It is easy to read, but not easy to understand.  It causes one to think -- no, to have to think.  One has to think about \\"Howl\\" if one reads it. It is one of those weird things you still think about years later on some lame Tuesday afternoon while paying bills.  So, most people avoid it so they don't have to try and come to grips with the affects it can have on their minds.  Football and movies are easier for people to deal with most of the time.<br />I don't know if this is a bad thing anymore.  People want to live comfortable lives, and if one thinks uncomfortable thoughts, then life can become uncomfortable.  One is forced into action to try and help right the wrongs of this world, and that is not easy.  Wrongs stay in place in large measure because people don't know how to fix them.  Sure, we can quote RFK and say, &quot;some see things that never were and ask why not&quot;, but saying things like that is the easy part.  <br />Reading, &quot;Howl&quot; changes a person.  Makes them uncomfortable, but it means to do that.  It is a great piece of writing.  It is probably the best piece of poetry written in the last half of the 20th century in the United States. <br />But beware; because it causes one of think of change.  Change can be good, and it can be bad.  I like to think \\"Howl\\" is good because it opened my eyes to ugly thoughts. True, ugly can be beautiful. But remember the hardest thing about change -- it is.

0385504209|5.0|This book was excellent!  I couldn't put it down.  The writing is top notch, the plot is full of great twists.  I see from reading the reviews that a lot of Christians are offended.  That's to be expected.  The fact of the matter is, Christianity has always concealed things and has always borrowed from other, older religions.  To say that Mr. Brown's facts are wrong because they are not supported by the bible assumes that ones believes the bible to be the end all, be all, which many people do not.  I like this line from the book: &quot;The bible did not arrive from Heaven by fax...&quot;  It is a myth, just as any other religion is.
1558908366|5.0|Straitlaced millionaire Edward Lewis (Richard Gere) picks up Hollywood Boulevard hooker Vivian Ward (Julia Roberts in her star maker role) and hires her to be his companion for a week. Roberts is wonderful as Vivian. One great moment among many: when Vivian wakes up in Edward's palatial penthouse suite \\"the morning after\\" and he offers her breakfast instead of making her leave immediately, her pleasure and surprise are touching. She grabs a roll off the breakfast table like a starving waif, as if she almost doesn't dare and is afraid it'll be snatched away. It's impossible not to like Vivian, and to root for her. She's irresistible.<br /><br />A solid cast benefits from Garry Marshall's surefooted direction. Elinor Dohanue (Betty Anderson/\\"Princess\\" from Father Knows Best) shines in a bit part. Jason Alexander, who would go on to fame and fortune in later years as George Costanza on Seinfeld, leaves a slime trail across the screen as Edward's lawyer, Phil Stuckey. Laura San Giacomo is completely believable as Kit De Luca, Vivian's fellow streetwalker and roommate. Hector Elizondo is outstanding as Bernard Thompson, the wise, polished, compassionate hotel manager who first helps Vivian then approves of her. Really, there are no slackers in this cast.<br /><br />And, in true Hollywood romance fashion, in the end the girl gets the guy for a wholly satisfying payoff.

B0000E1WKE|1.0|with the expection of 'o holy night' &amp; 'o come o come emanuel' this is album is an absolute disaster of extreme proportions. whitney is a coke head who lacks the vocal prowless that america once fell in love with.
B0000VCZK2|5.0|I haven't finished all the dvds yet but just watched the special edition of alien3. It is excellent, the edition tells more clearly to the story and they even change some parts in the story. And remember, you get 40 hrs of extra in those 5 extra dvds. This is a must buy for alien fans.<br />P.S. I preorder this item last week in amazon, and it arrived today. This is a surprise!!!
B00006EXL5|5.0|I couldn't sum it up in one word.  My Chemical Romance will not only put on the show of a lifetime, pumped with enegry, enthusiam and a unmatchable desire to play music, but they will also put out an album twice as great, because it's the same amazing energy and music, only it's at your fingertips at all times.  You can not generalize this group. I highly suggest that you visit their website and you will be able to see the pure passion that they are driven by.  Buy it, download it, just as long as you experience it.
B0000E1WKE|5.0|Let the haters hate on but the fact remains, Whitney can sing, and she did nothing but justice to all the traditional Christmas Carols. She has a gift of delivering songs and with that gift she just blesses us and this album is yet another one of those blessings. Aretha is old, yet she's still blessing us with her voice. I sure do hope that Whitney will also sing for decades to come. Bobbi Kristina Brown is superb on &quot;Little Drummer Boy&quot;. Cissy, Whitney and now the world is eargerly waiting for Bobbi Kristina. Buy this album, it will be worth your while.
B00005JMFO|4.0|Not to be seen on a first date, that's for sure.  Other than that, a nice slice of love life seen from different situations. The direction was normal, but the acting and the script were well done.  Very refreshing to see an adult movie that doesn't rely on special effects to carry the story, because, here, the story carries itself.<BR>I noticed that many reviews complained about the nude scenes.  I guess that's why it's often referred to as an \\"adult\\" movie. I had no problem with them---after all, it comes with the subject matter. The \\"negative effects of love\\", as one reviewer called it, are part of life. Not everyone's mind you, but they are out there. Ignoring that or covering it up are not going to change that. Just Google \\"Buddhist movie reviews\\" to see what I mean. Tolerance is half the battle won.<BR>Not a fantastic movie, and I see no Oscar nods heading its way, but my date and I enjoyed it. It was even better with the popcorn.
B0000DD7NL|5.0|Absolutely amazing follow-up to the seemingly impossible-to-compare &quot;Songs in A Minor&quot;. I personally like this disc even better than the aforementioned record. As a pianist, I completely respect Alicia's musical talent on the piano, and it is showcased very often. But Alicia, in my opinion, is showing off more of her vocals on this CD, and they are definitely suprising (in the best way possible.) I had the chance to watch Alicia perform on Good Morning America, where she performed &quot;You Don't Know My Name&quot; (the first single), &quot;Harlem's Nocturne&quot; (at least a part of it...) and &quot;If I Ain't Got You&quot; (my personal favorite). The lead singer of the lead single was not sitting behind a piano for once, but standing up singing. Was it in order not to squash her diaphragm and to showcase her vocals? While others may not think so, I do. Alicia tends to go into more edgy territory. Not alot of fast-paced songs are featured on this CD (with the exceptions of songs like &quot;Karma&quot;, another favorite). But the remainder of the songs are far from ballads - she has such an extraordinary way of keeping songs similar but not repetitively boring. &quot;If I Ain't Got You&quot; touches me deep - it's pretty much what I'm going through. Her vocals are AMAZING, hitting notes I never knew Alicia could hit. &quot;Karma&quot;'s beats and words are stunning, &quot;Wake Up&quot;'s amazing message - my hat is off to Alicia. The bonus DVD has music videos (with clips from &quot;Girlfriend&quot; - who knew she shot a video for that??) and behind the scenes footage. An absolutely excellent sophomore album from the lady to beat right now, Ms. Alicia Keys. Even more respect goes to you - Keep it up!
B000002UJQ|5.0|After recieving much criticism from my friends for listeing to such errie and dark music, I was recentfull to liten to is, but i couldent stop. When i listen to each song i listen twice, once to hear the buitiful melodys and brillient sound, the second time i annalyse the words and try to come to an understanding about what York is trying to say. After listening to the album i fell like i have just read a great novel. It send many messages that other band couldent even imagine to incorperate in to their music. Only an album like this can do these things.
B00005JLH3|5.0|THIS MOVIE DOSNT GET ANY BETTER NO MOVIES GET ANY BETTER THIS MOVIE GETS YOUIN A GOOD MOOD.

B0000DD7NL|5.0|Truly an amazing album, like someone else said Alicia Keys has outdone herself, every track is AMAZING!  This album is well worth buying... don't bootleg it actually BUY this Album because it is truly worth it!!!!
B00005ATQD|3.0|They should have filmed this movie, but, putting a tape in the camera to record it was completely unnecessary.
B0000DD7LB|5.0|I think this Cd is one of her best, It isn't as god as the Britney(3rd one) but is totally one of the best cd's to listen again &amp; again!
B000065LZM|5.0|Tom Waits is the greatest living songwriter, a true genius whose music will last for decades to come.  Rain dogs ranks as one of his best albums, along with swordfishtrombones, bone machine and blood money.  You will not be disappointed.
B0000CDL93|4.0|JFK provides quite a dramatic viewpoint of several conspiracy theories surrounding the assination of John F. Kennedy.  First of all, I'd like to say that I know basically nothing about the actual details of the assination, so I can't say for sure how much of this movie is acurate to the historical fact.  However, I can say that it features a stunning preformance by Kevin Costner as investigator Jim Garrison and the movie pays much on the drama of the further investigation of the death of the president.  Overall, I thought that the movie opened America's eyes to the possibility of conspiracys surrounding the government.  The depiction of Oswald as being a &quot;patsy&quot; is one of the focal points of the film and it weaves a web of conspiracies involving Cuban guerrilla influences, Communism, and even questions about the American government's role in Kennedy's death.  The movie cultivates with the trial of Shaw.  The trial scene is where the intensity of the movie reaches its climax and although its depiction really does show how little of an actual case Garrison had on Shaw, it passionately attempts to unravel some of the mysteries involving the death of the president.  &quot;The magic bullet&quot; evidence really makes you believe that there has to have been at least some cover up of the details involving that famous day in Texas.  If anything, this movie brings the case into the spotlight, even if it will remain to be shadowed by some doubt.<br />There are, however, some problems with the movie.  Other reviewers have stated that many facts have been juggled in order to create a believable story, and I'm sure that this is true.  It is unlikely that a number of the cut scences actually took place in their entiretity.  Also, some of the &quot;star studed actors&quot; that were featured in the film seemed to be playing roles that were not suited well for them.  Joe Pesci seemed miscast and John Candy's character was almost laughable in such a serious movie.  Finally, the movie is about three hours long and seems to drag in some places.  I haven't seem the un-cut version, but I can't really see why the extra material in the directors cut is really needed.  So many conspiracies are tossed around that after awhile, some of them to disprove each other.<br />Overall, JFK may not be most perfect movie and probably did bend the facts a little, but it is worth seeing at least once.  If you don't want to wade through the whole movie, skip to the trial scence because it is the best part of the film.
B000001F3C|4.0|I didn't want to say &quot;worst,&quot; because it's still very good.  I just think, other than &quot;Sunday,&quot; and &quot;New Year's,&quot; this album spreads thin compared to the rest of U2's albums.  The closing track is good also, but it seems more like a leftover from OCTOBER.  WAR is, I think, the most overrated U2 album (POP is the most underrated).  It still deserves 4 stars, though!
B000002L42|4.0|The duo of jazz-rock fusionists Walter Becker and Donald Fagen, both of whom can best be described as &quot;musical malcontents,&quot; put a hault to all live shows during their original run after only a few years of touring, and bound their creations strictly to the studio. After their original 1972-80 stint, the two parted ways but fortunately were working together again on each other's solo projects by the time the 90s rolled around. This live album (a surprising release from a band that was notorious for their studio-sterile sound) was perhaps the best that Becker &amp; Fagen could do to satisfy their fanbase, seeing as how they wouldn't release a new studio album until 2000.<br />The thought-provoking cover of &quot;Alive In America&quot; conveys the duo's sardonic sense of humor, and the track selection, though somewhat unimpressive, shows all the elements of their musical contempt. Postcards from the wasteland like 'Kid Charlemagne' are matched with the more sunnier hits that helped place them into the embrace of success like 'Reeling In the Years' and 'Josie.' But it has to be said that many of their better moments are missing, and the choice of songs and predictable arrangements can often induce yawns. The album doesn't sound very &quot;live&quot; at all, but that's not surprising considering the band's studio preferences.<br />But aside from that, &quot;Alive In America&quot; was a healthy dose for fans until the Grammy-winning &quot;Two Against Nature&quot; appeared five years later. But it also showed that Walter Becker and Donald Fagen were interested in reviving their past creations together and not just limited to each other's solo outings.
B00009TB5G|5.0|With all the extra scenes and the extended scenes, we have a great, fully detailed story, with lots of character development, much of which focused on Frodo and Gollum.  They also add more scenes with Merry and Pippin dealing with the Ents.<br />The extras as great, dealing not only with how they were able to produce massive armies for the big screen, but one chapter deals totally with just the development of the character of Smeagol/Gollum.<br />Of course, like the first collection of DVDs, they deal with the general problems and issues of turning the second book into the second movie.  The backgrounds, plot twists, special effects, weapons, languages, music, miniatures and accidents.  Not only are the cool Uruk-hai back, along with the Nazgul, but we get to see the first Wargs - giant wolves who have allied themselves with the Goblins(also known as Orcs).  I can't wait for the Return of the King!
B0000CAQ27|5.0|Pink has definitely proved she has staying power with this album. It's a lot more rock, but it's still fun and still the Pink we know. She has some very deep songs on this cd, like &quot;Save My Life&quot; and &quot;Love Song&quot;, but she also has got some awesome fun, rockin' songs like &quot;Trouble&quot;, &quot;Humble Neighborhoods&quot; and my personal favorite, &quot;God is a DJ&quot;. If you enjoyed her last cd *Missundaztood* then you should take Pink's advice and Try This!!
B000001FS3|5.0|The Tree lies in the middle of the Americana trilogy.  While The Unforgetable Fire has a dark, Irish-based feel, the band is obviously showing an admiration for US icons.  The Tree has a brighter, &quot;American Heartland&quot; feel and the band is photographed in Nevada, while the deep lyrics and wiry guitar leads are carried over from the previous album, and sound more refined.  These manners go even further on Rattle and Hum.<BR>The Tree introduced me to U2.  It was a Xmas present from a cousin in 1987, as they were becoming the biggest band in the world.  <BR>I don't know, I think this seems to be the most AUTHENTIC U2 album.
B000007ODM|5.0|I was ordering music CD's through Amazon when I came across Era, the cover and song titles intrigued me and I was compelled to buy the CD. After listening to the whole CD, from start to finish, I am now and most happily a Era fan.<br />I can easily describe this music as a mix of dark ambient meets electronica. Eric Levi has charted and blended the two styles of music and created a very well, deep and thought provoking compilation. The gregorian Latin chants of Ameno, Avemano and Impera are simply seductive.<br />My favourites were the Ameno Remix and Enae Volare Mezzo, I simply and gladly closed my eyes and relaxed and the female vocalists are supurb.<br />Finally, anyone wanting something totally different and wonderful, don't go past Era.
0451450523|5.0|This story was magically scribed.   The words flowed through me without effort making the hours of reading seem timeless.<br />This is one of the few stories to actually paint images into my dreams and waking thoughts without assistance.<br />It's hard to explain.   But the story is well written and original.    Easily read in one sitting and the loss of time goes unnoticed.
B0000DD7NL|5.0|Alicia Keys is truly talented.  She really puts her heart and soul into her music and it comes through.  #9 &quot;wake up&quot; is one of my favs.<br />Buy this CD, you will not be disappointed!
B000127LW2|5.0|With Star Trek: The Next Generation winding down to conclusion and the embattled Star Trek: Deep Space Nine initially being a hard sell to Trek fans, Paramount Studios demanded another Trek spinoff.  Considering early struggles with Deep Space Nine, the producers decided to return to the original mold of a starship boldly exploring space...but with a twist: this ship is lost and stranded in the most distant corner of our galaxy with slim to little hope of getting home in under 70 years.<br />This intrepid premise was coupled with an unparalleled medley of characters.  The first female Star Trek lead as Captain Kathryn Janeway.  A holographic program replaces the ship's surgeon who was killed on route to this distant region of space.  A former prisoner, Lt. Tom Paris, takes the helm.  Commander Chakotay debuts as the first Native American Starfleet officer.  Reminiscent of Sulu, there is Ensign Harry Kim as operations officer.  And a solute to Spock, there is the black Vulcan security chief, Lt. Tuvok.  Rounding out the cast is the half human, half Klingon chief engineer, Lt. Torres; and two new alien crewmembers: Kes and Neelix.  And thus Star Trek: Voyager was born...<br />Returning to old favorites did not give this particular Trek incarnation high ratings for long, rather this soon became a more embattled spinoff than Deep Space Nine.  As fans began to embrace the radical plot twists and story arcs of Deep Space Nine, the traditional plots of Voyager earned it the label \\"Star Trek: The Next Generation, Lite\\".<br />Still, the first season is definitely worth purchasing since one gets to see the beginnings of what promised to be the best of all Star Treks.  Considering the rich unknowns that awaited this crew in the farthest reaches of space: no hope of reinforcements in times of danger, no hope of new supplies thus testing this new crews' survival skills, and slim chances of getting home to familiar territory.  In the end, the show did not capitalize upon all of its incredible potential, but in the first season, one can consider the awe of the journey that lay before them.<br />Included in this DVD boxset is a special treat: rare footage of the original actress cast as Captain Janeway: Genevieve Bujold.  After half a week on the job, she marched off the set and quit...handing the role over to Kate Mulgrew.  This must have been an incredibly tumultuous time in the early days of filming the pilot for this series, and it will be wonderful to see how the producers handled this problem.  More so, it will be interesting to see a different face in the role of Voyager's captain if only for a few short clips.<br />As a Star Trek fan, this DVD is a must own.  For the \\"uninitiated\\" thinking about owning some Star Trek episodes, this first season of Star Trek: Voyager is an awesome primer.
B00008JLKL|5.0|The third Volume of Era is again, a beautiful piece of crafted sound art. Eric Levi has not lost what made Era 1 and Era 2 successes, a blend of wondrous vocalists mixed with glorious beats. The Mass, Avemano Orchestral, Enae Volare and Vonifera are the picks of the CD.<br />Yes, it is a short escape from reality but it is well worth it. I cannot wait to hear the next Era. Eagerly waiting! Let's just hope that it will not be too long a wait.
0345350499|4.0|A strong feminist view point guided this story.   Aside from the alternative take it was well written.   I could hardly put the book down finishing in a 14 hour reading marathon.<br />The book is a retelling of the Aurthurian Legends from King Arthur's sister (Morgan le Fay) point-of-view.
B000002H2H|5.0|This album just proves that Metallica is the best band in the world.  They can do it all, fast, slow, intricate, simple, meaningful, and just plain heavy.  Hats off to James because he is my god.  Not only is he the best riff-writter of all time, he is the best lyric writter and front-man ever.  The feelings expressed in Fade to Black goes unmatched in any non-metallica music i listen to.  By god, the solos that Kirk came up are genious.  The drum work is one of my favorite by Lars because it just fits so perfectally and let's not forget Cliff, the whole album is a Cliff masterpiece.  I love all their albums from Kill em All to ST.Anger, the boys have never failed me and have always been there with the right song to make my day right.
B0000C0FJB|5.0|It is incredible the euphoria and energy that this album delivers, the song YYZ is worth the money. Yes, it is not A+ when it comes down to sound quality but it makes you feel as if you are right there in the middle of it, experiencing the concert. Simple: Awesome pure raw energy, thats what this record is all about.
B000003TA4|4.0|this was a great ablum. must say it was overrated though.  In Utero is a better album than this.  i think people made this album seem more amazing than it really was because people obsessed with the new image of grunge when it all started.  Although this album did help get grunge going, it had already been around with soundgarden and chris cornell who basically invented it in 1985. Kurt Cobain just became the poster child for grunge, elevating this album's popularity.  Great early 90s album, but being &quot;one of the greatest albums ever&quot;?.....i dunno about that.
B0000DJZA5|2.0|I bought this when it came out and, apart from listening to Long and Winding Road a few times, it has stayed in its case for most of the time since. Overall this is a waste of any Beatles fan's time, and I'm seriously considering getting rid of my copy.<br />It's not that there's anything wrong with the clean-up of the classic here, but that it feels like a slick album by comparison to the original. I had the original for a few days back when I was in high school, I got rid of it because it was too rough for my taste. Now I'm thinking of getting the original again. Either way, this is probably my least-favorite Beatles album, so I'm willing to admit I might be biased as to the veracity of this version. I haven't even bothered listening to the \\"bonus fly on the wall\\" disc, that just seems like too much. Overall, this album left me with a bad taste in my stomach, like I'd wasted my money.<br />Steer clear of this unless you don't have Anthology Three (which has a un-Spectorized versions of Long and Winding Road, and a better version of For You Blue). Otherwise, this is a waste of money (It gets two stars for effort, and the fact that Paul wasn't allowed to muck up the writing credits[...].
B00005JG6Q|5.0|Ok, when I bought this, I was into FLCL. The animation was old, which I suspected. What I didn't suspect was the great movie that unfolded before me.<br />It starts out with the main characters, Tatsuo and Kanada, in a biker gang. As the movie progresses, old Children enter the scene and open the door to god's power within Tatsuo. Next, is Chaos.<br />Akira was said to be the best movie in japanese animation, and I agree. Released in the US in the Late 80's, it has opened American's eyes to anime, and still does today. If you want a movie with great character developement, animation, and not to forget a mind scrambling plot, then I recomend this with utmost praise.
B00006CXXU|5.0|People dismiss Christina because of her improfone image, but thats a shame because they''re missing some serious talent.  Christina co-wrote most of the songs on the CD and I knew she was talented vocally, but her lyrics blew me away.  Hopefully this CD will distance her from other so-called pop artists who can't sing but get by on their looks and dancing ability.  Christina's voice is so powerful and the whole CD is just fantastic.  She does a great job of relating some of the sadder moments in her childhood in some of the songs on the CD, which are just heartbreaking.  I hope she continues to write and sing the way she wants to.  Rock on girl!!
B0000DD7NL|1.0|There is absolutely NOTHING and I mean NOTHING I like about this CD!!!!! If you ask me this CD is nothing but a big bag of crude bullcrap!!!! I wouldn't even want my dog to hear that thing sing!!! All the songs are BORING, they don't make any sense &amp; no one can even relate to them and that video makes me sick!!! Give me a break!!! I honestly think that alicia keys should stop singing and go feed her diseased cats!!!    I'm out!!!
B000092ZYX|5.0|I bought the album mostly for &quot;There There&quot;, which I had heard a few times on the radio and once on CSI. I was kind of hesitant buying an entire CD for one song, even after listening to some of the clips here. But am I glad I did! I love this album. And not just a few songs --- all of them. This is a really good CD! The songs get stuck in your head, especially &quot;A Wolf at the Door&quot;.  I don't know anything about Radiohead other than a few tunes on the radio over the years, but I plan on buying more of their albums soon. I hope they're as good as this one.
B0000DJZA5|5.0|It is a wonderful thing to hear the Beatles so crisp and clear. You can hear the words on \\"For You Blue\\". You can also enjoy \\"The Long and Winding Road\\" because it's actually pleasing to the ears. Gone are those annoying sounds of Spector's.  Some people need to be reminded that the Beatles never ever needed orchestration in their songs. When they did, it was an agreed thing with George Martin (if you don't know who he is, quit reading this review). Spector's \\"sound\\" made the Beatles music garbled and disjointed.  [...]the Beatles' \\"simplicity\\" (\\"their typical 2 or 3 guitars and a keyboard\\") is superior in every way to Phil Spector's mangling.
B0000DD7NL|4.0|I absolutly love this cd. I mean Alicia Keys really brought it, I loved Songs in A Minor but this record is so much better. It's very mature and very soulful. I really love her voice, and her lyrics are so real you can relate to them. My favorite tracks are:<BR>of course<BR>#4 If I was your woman..beautiful reamake <BR>#5 You don't know my name, I love this song...<BR>#6 If I aint got you<BR>#7 Diary oh my goodness tha jam fa real <BR>#11 when you really love someone...very pretty<BR>#15 nobody not really..very pretty kinda jazzy like<BR>all the AK fans will love this CD and even the ones who arent really fans..will become fans..go pick it up..its worth the money.
B00005JM02|5.0|This is simply one of the finest animated films of all time, timeless adorable charectors, hilarious Pelicans.  Great artistry througout.  This film is not just for kids adults of all ages will find this to be an endearing and timeless heartwarming stroy.  A timeless classic.
B000002BQK|5.0|While &quot;Butterfly&quot; certainly didn't top the sales of her previous albums in the 90's (&quot;Mariah Carey&quot;, &quot;Emotions&quot;, &quot;Daydream&quot; to name a few), it still managed to bring her #1 hits and continues to be the best in quality out of all of her albums. She finally got more critics' attention (in a good way) with the amount of experimentation on &quot;Butterfly.&quot;  Being centred around her (at the time) post-divorce period from Sony CEO Tommy Matolla, &quot;Butterfly&quot; deals with loss and sorrow and contains a multitude of slow tracks.  Highlights of those songs include the album's title track, where it is hard not to notice the level of emotion in her singing.  The concluding &quot;Outside&quot; shows even more pain and sorrow, as well as a flawless remake of Prince's &quot;The Beautiful Ones&quot; featuring Sisqo of Dru Hill.  Fans of upbeat music will enjoy the opening track which gained her yet another number one single.  Trackmasters accompanys her on the haunting &quot;The Roof&quot;, a failed single.  Missy &quot;Misdamenor&quot; Elliot also gives a cameo, co-writing the soul-laced &quot;Babydoll.&quot;  Techno enthusiests will enjoy the interlude (part of the &quot;Butterfly&quot; remix) of &quot;Fly Away (Butterfly Reprise)&quot; which is basically the title track, remixed sampling Elton John's &quot;Skyline Pigeon.&quot;  As a whole, &quot;Butterfly&quot; tops it off as Mariah's best and most critically aclaimed album. It brought in 2 number one hits and showed sides of her no one else has yet seen. The sad part is doubters think she'll never top it. &quot;Glitter&quot; came close, but with her highly publicized physical and emotional traumas it failed to spend nearly a week at the charts. Overall grade for &quot;Butterfly&quot;: A+
B0000BYM3K|4.0|I've seen Maiden in concert a half dozen times. I own everything they've released in about three or four different formats/versions. Remastered and non-remastered. Vinyl and CD. <br />Not to mention DVD.<br />So I bought Dance of Death with great expectations -- especially I had just seen Maiden blow away a sold-out audience in Detroit a month prior to its release.<br />Sadly, Dance of Death is only marginally better than Brave New World. And maybe not even better. Maybe just about as good.<br />What disappointed me about Dance of Death was its dearth of originality. Many of the songs reminded me of songs from Brave New World. (I dare any fan to deny that.) Or, worse, Virtual XI and X Factor. There's still a lot of repetition of verses going on, bad habits from the Blaze Bayley days, I'm afraid.<br />What saves this album, in my opinion (surely not its cheesy cover art -- where's Derek Riggs when you need him?), is the fact that it is, after all, Iron Maiden. And the classic line-up (plus one!) of Iron Maiden at that.<br />Nobody writes music like Iron Maiden. Nobody sounds like Bruce Dickinson. Nobody plays bass like Steve Harris. Nobody showboats like Janick Gers. Nobody has the speed and melody of Dave Murray or Adrian Smith. Even when they seem to parody themselves, Iron Maiden is still light years beyond most bands today.<br />And maybe that's why I've been harder on Dance of Death than I probably should have been. This is Iron Maiden, for Pete's sake! I've heard what they're capable of. They blow the roof off concert venues when they tour. And their back catalog of music still electrifies me some 15-20 years on.<br />That said, I must confess that &quot;Wildest Dreams&quot; was a blast to see performed live. And &quot;Paschendale&quot; is a fascinating epic of a song. &quot;No More Lies&quot; suffers from Brave New Worldism, sounding too much like an outtake from the previous album. But &quot;Monstesegur&quot; rocks and &quot;Gates of Tomorrow&quot; features acool intro riff.<br />Every track has something of value in it. It's just that, taken as a whole, Dance of Death doesn't surprise and delight like it could have.<br />Still...<br />This is Iron Maiden. So you have to buy it, anyway. It's required. Eddie says so.
B0000DD7LC|5.0|Once again , Alicia is able to blend old school funk, classical piano and sultry vocals to produce a masterpiece of an album...it is definitely worth the wait and worth the money. I definitely recommend this record. Well done, Alicia!!!
B0000C7PSW|1.0|overblown, hystryonic crap that sticks to your face like a killer piece of Limburger cheese and won't let go until you are dead.  This kind of crap gives homosexuals a bad name.
B00008RH3L|5.0|Miller's Crossing is still largely a cult classic, tragically. This movie is among the finest crime films of all time. The film is incredibly realistic, from the grittily real period dialogue, set design, and wardrobe to the engrossing tale of depression-era mob maneuvers and double-crosses that keeps twisting and turning until the final conclusion. Everything works, and the film is so utterly compelling that it deserves a more lofty position among the greatest crime films of all time.<br />The production values are extraordinarily high. The Coens display a nearly obsessive attention to detail to recreate the time and setting of depression-era Chicago. The dialogue is sumptuous and full of colorful language and local aphorisms. Wardrobe, lighting, and sound all come together to form a distinct feel. This is the most period-accurate film I have ever seen.<br />But all of that would mean nothing without effective storytelling and acting. The story revolves around Tom (Gabriel Byrne), right-hand man of a local, benevolent mob boss, Leo  (Albert Finney). When he disagrees with his boss on whether or not to surrender a bookie (John Turturro), whose sister (Marcia Gay Harden) is romantically involved with both Leo and Tom, to an opposing mob boss (Jon Polito). What erupts is gang warfare, leading to shifting allegiances, deception, and a fascinating examination of duty and ethics. This is a character-driven tale, and it succeeds largely because of its very talented cast. Byrne is perfect as Tom, who comes off as apathetic, even psychopathic at times, but he is actually highly principled if you consider the context of his actions. Albert Finney is also marvelous as Leo, the well-meaning but somewhat incompetent gangster leader. John Turturro is genuinely hateful as a slimy bookie who tries to manipulate Tom's misfortunes to his own advantage, even after Tom saves his life. Jon Polito is great, as always, playing a very contradictory character very averse to getting the \\"high hat.\\" Marcia Gay Harden, though, steals the show in an Oscar-nominated turn as a two-timing grifter. All of these actors are immaculately cast and give excellent performances.<br />All things considered, this movie is one of the most complete, moving, and spellbinding historical epic and crime film ever made. This is definitely one to see, and hopefully someday this film will be able to take its rightful place among the best films ever made.
B0000DZ3EA|4.0|I'm a huge fan of Peter Gabriel's. I think the man can do no wrong.<br />Except in this case.<br />I was somewhat disappointed with Hit. The first disc (aptly named &quot;Hit&quot;) contains some of his best work, true. But the second disc (also aptly named as &quot;Miss&quot;) contains some real clunkers (and omits some real jewels) for a supposedly definitive Greatest Hits package.<br />I do a lot of driving. So I do a lot of listening to CDs and Books-On-Tape in the car. I kept Hit in the player for nearly two weeks straight when I first bought it...and couldn't seem to bring myself to listen to the second disc more than a couple of times. And I don't know why. The second disc contains some of the greatest music ever recorded. Witness &quot;In Your Eyes&quot; or the slowly building &quot;San Jacinto&quot; or the emotionally revealing &quot;I Love to Be Loved.&quot;<br />Maybe it's the track order of Miss that trips me up. Maybe it's the inclusion of lesser appreciated (by me, anyway) tracks such as &quot;Father, Son&quot; or &quot;Signal to Noise&quot; or &quot;The Drop.&quot; Perhaps too much from Up is represented here when I thought Up was one of Peter's least accessible albums of late. (I would have substituted &quot;The Barry Williams Show&quot; for one of the 4-5 songs from Up represented on Hit; it's a much more up-tempo track that played very well in concert.) Perhaps it's what other reviewers have pointed out: nothing from Peter 2 is featured on Hit.<br />I don't know what my beef is with Hit. All I know is that I can't make myself give it five stars.<br />But that doesn't mean I can't recommend Hit highly. The songs that ARE here are astounding. Mesmerizing, in fact. They offer a fascinating retrospective on the career of one of the world's most consistently interesting musicians. (Perhaps a truly definitive Greatest Hits package isn't possible with Peter Gabriel unless it's a three- or four-disc boxed set. Even then, &quot;definitive&quot; would likelyneed to include every single one of Peter Gabriel's albums because each one contains flashes of brilliance.)<br />I could listen to &quot;Solsbury Hill&quot; all day long. Likewise, anything from So (&quot;Sledgehammer&quot; is classic with a capital &quot;C.&quot;). So I totally get into disc one.<br />It's just that off-beat disc two that I find hard to enjoy.<br />Although, looking at it from another perspective, I can see that Peter thinks just as highly of his work on Up as he does his more &quot;classic&quot; material from the '70s and '80s. I can respect that.<br />But, what about Peter 2? Does the exclusion of that album's material indicate Peter's dislike for it? One could draw that conclusion.<br />All in all, I'd probably recommend Shaking the Tree: 16 Golden Greats as a more hit-packed (and accessible) Greatest Hits collection before I'd recommend Hit.<br />If you're new to Peter Gabriel, I'd start with Shaking the Tree. If you're already a Peter Gabriel fan, I wouldn't hesitate to add Hit to your collection.
B000002JPA|5.0|My first ever DT cd was A Change Of Seasons, a great cd no doubt but when I heard Images And Words only a few years later I was amazed by this wonderful artwork, sometimes I find myself listenning to this cd in repeat!<br />Like other masterpieces such as Megadeth's Rust In Peace or the first Rage Against The Machine album this one doesn't need to grow on you, it's love at first note.<br />Buy &amp; Enjoy!!!
B0000DD7NL|5.0|I liked Songs in A Minor, but I can truly say that I love this album. The song, You Don't Know My Name has got to be one of the best r&amp;b songs that I have heard this year. She is truly a really gifted artist. On this album Alicia Keys takes us back to the days of real r&amp;b. She incorporates the sounds of the 60's and 70's into modern r&amp;b/ hip hop. This is one cd that I can listen to without skipping a track. Some cds have a few good songs but this cd is so rich with great music and vocals. Another one of my favorite songs is So Simple. Alicia Keys has really represented on this cd. If you like good music I suggest that you buy this cd.
B0000AXE8I|4.0|Definitely a worthy sequel.  As a kid, I was indoctrinated by 'The Empire Strikes Back' to accept a movie that leaves me hanging for the next installment!  I agree with the reviewers here that give 'Reloaded' a good review, but I have to make a couple of additional points in response to their critique.<br />-The feel of the series is best thought of as a graphic novel brought to life.  Therefore, wearing of sunglasses indoors at night, philisophical double-speak, and over-wrought drama are to be expected and even desired!  This is also the reason for the music video-like choreography.  Its a style choice, not meant to be realistic.<br />-The matrix itself is a computer program, so I would expect a hundred Smiths fighting Neo to look like a video game - it is one!<br />I haven't seen 'Revolutions' yet, but regardless of its reviews, I will probably enjoy it just by tailoring my attitude to what the filmmakers intended.
B0000BWVCM|5.0|With the huge success of X-MEN, it was only natural that a sequel would eventually follow. Indeed, X-MEN proved to be the harbinger of the current trend of high budget superhero films based on the Marvel comics.  X-MEN UNITED is that rare sequel that both builds and improves upon what has gone on before in the first film.  Basically picking up where the original left off, things get off to a rollicking start when a strange blue-skinned mutant attempts to assassinate the President.  Later, it turns out that government agent William Stryker (Bryan Cox) is behind the attack in order to further a plot to destroy all mutants.  As a result, the heroic X-Men must join forces with old foe Magneto (Ian McKellen) to stop Stryker's plans.<br />Like any sequel should be, X2 is a bigger, better, and more fun film than the original.  With much of the set-up already taken care of, the film starts off quickly and never lets go.  Most of the original cast reprise their roles and they never miss a beat. Hugh Jackman leads the way as the surly Wolverine, remaining a solid focus for the audience to identify with.  Patrick Stewart's Professor X and McKellen's Magneto again provide the film's philosophical center with their solid performances.  Compared to the last film, Halle Berry actually gets more to do as weather-witch Storm and she makes the most of it with some touching moments.  Famke Janssen also scores effectively in the pivotal role of Dr. Jean Grey.  As the \\"new mutant on the block,\\" Alan Cumming adds both humor and warmth as the blue-skinned Nightcrawler.  Bryan Cox brings both pathos and menace as the nasty Stryker, while Kelly Hu brings the right touch of darkness as Stryker's aide, Lady Deathstrike.  Director Brian Singer directs with a sure hand, while creating a coherent story despite the rather large amount of characters.  <br />With its intelligent story, solid cast, and riveting action, X-2: X-MEN UNITED succeeds where many comic films tend to fail, which makes thisa film well worth recommending to fan and non-fan alike.
0446608955|5.0|A Walk to Remember is the best book in the world. I love this book so much. When I was reading it, I couldn't pay attention to anything else around me. I was totally into the book. Everytime I turned the page, I was so excited what would happen next. I have seen the movie, which is just so Wonderful too. This book has some differences than the movie but it is realllyyyy good. You should certainly read it. It is so pretty. It is written with such loveliness. It is very heartwearming and beautiful. Whoever doesn't read this, is missing out on something really special...=)
B00008DDSC|4.0|This movie is unlike both what I heard of it (S&amp;M extravaganza) and what I read on the DVD jacket (quirky romantic comedy).  It's use of S&amp;M is far more subtle and, for lack of a better word, likable, than I expected.  If you're a bit squeamish and uneasy at the idea of S&amp;M being a potent ingredient in the movie you're about to watch, I would still recommend &quot;Secretary.&quot;  <br />It's about a slightly unbalanced girl (Maggie Gylenhaal, in a very vulnerable, but strong peformance) who, upon coming home from a mental institution, is pushed to get a job.  She's very shy, but James Spader's character is attracted to that, against his will, and hires her.  What follows is the story of their attraction to each other and the needs that each one fulfills in the other.  The S&amp;M element is not overblown and is not shown in a nasty, explicit way.  Rather, you see it as just one of the things that gives them an understanding.<br />This is a funny, though still quite dark, love story and by the end of it, you empathize and enjoy the characters, even though they are far from perfect.  This is one of the more realistic versions of true love that I've seen.
B000068IEU|1.0|I should study a film more before I go out and buy it.  Hey, it was only $10 at the store so I figured what the hey. This is just a dumb movie with no intellectual writing behind it, poor quality and poor acting, a soft core porn no doubt. I don't see how this film can be innovative at all.  First of it's kind?  Inspiration for many movies ahead of it?  I think not.  Many people who are in favor of this film point out the sociological perspective of the plot and how it represents a breakdown between cultures, but anyone who really understands the film will agree that it was made to be perverse and exploit, not to teach or innovative.
B0000CEB4V|5.0|I get chills even thinking about the concert.  Billy Preston along with Tom Petty and Eric Clapton were amazing... their depictions of Harrison's songs were so moving.  This DVD would be an exceptional gift for any member of the family.
B000069AUI|4.0|Perhaps I'm in the minority, but although there are a lot of great songs on this album (the haunting beauty of &quot;The Scientist&quot; and &quot;Warning Sign,&quot; the sing-out-loud joy of &quot;Green Eyes&quot;--please please please don't let that be about Gwyneth Paltrow--,and the falsetto catchiness of &quot;Clocks&quot;), I still think that it's far more likely that, in five years, I'll be listening to &quot;Parachutes,&quot; rather than this album.  There's a lot of greatness here, but for all their liner notes and &quot;Politik,&quot; I just don't feel very much heart on this album.  Beauty, yes.  Artistry, definitely.  Real feeling, not so much. <br />That said, it's a wonderful album and if you're thinking about buying it, do.  You'll enjoy it.  Just listen to &quot;Parachutes&quot; too.  It doesn't have the complexity of &quot;Rush. . .&quot; but that simplicity is part of its joy.
B0000CABK8|4.0|Look, the more recent movies come with a decent amount of material. Stop moaning over the undiscovered country. If you are a trekkie and it really matters to you, you know that ST VI was not that great. And if it really matters that much, throw away 6 or give it as a gift and buy the new version when it comes. This is offered to give buyers a chance to have all 10 movies in a uniform package, and all in one view. Get it for 13.99 when Amazon releases it (it's in the same style), and get a life outside of TV. Buy it from a zShop for 140.00 and save the 30 bucks. Then you can buy The Undiscovered Country for 14 and get the super saver shipping. You will have saved a big 16 bucks. Hey, thats enough to get you a &quot;PENNY PINCHING, UNGRATEFUL TO THE PEOPLE WHO BROUGHT IT TO YOU AT ALL GEEK&quot; T-Shirt. Big props to PARAMOUNT AND AMAZON for bringing these great sets.
0156027321|3.0|Life of Pi, by Yann Martel, kept me enthralled for almost the whole duration of the novel, but in the end left me feeling dissatisfied and uncertain. From the beginning, I was fascinated and at times humored by Pi's whole ordeal. The combining of his diverse   ideas and practices, which stemmed from his observance of Hinduism, Christianity, AND Islam, allowed for some interesting ideas and events to occur while Pi fought to survive in the Pacific. \\"I practised religious rituals that I adapted to the circumstances --- solitary Masses without priests or consecrated Communion hosts, darshans without murtis, and pujas with turtle meat for prasad, acts of devotion to Allah not knowing where Mecca was and getting my Arabic wrong. They brought me comfort, that is certain.\\" (Pg. 208) Although there was not much physical action during Pi and Richard Parker's ordeal, for understood reasons, the measures that they took in order to survive I found engrossing.<BR>At the end of reading Life of Pi, I concluded that the theme of the novel is that faith and resolve can get you through even the most unbelievable circumstances. I would personally agree with this theme and the way Pi viewed his life's events and what he believed in. However others may feel differently depending on what they believe and how strongly they feel about their beliefs. This novel showed me that as long as you have an ultimate goal and have faith in that goal, you will somehow in some unexpected way be provided with what you need to succeed. <BR> I would recommend Life of Pi, to readers who don't mind a choose-your-own-ending type of book. I personally did not like the way the book ended and wanted a concrete explanation of what really happened to Pi. The book provided two possible endings of what really happened to Pi, one that did not include Richard Parker and all the other animals Pi claimed to have shared his lifeboat with temporarily. When I finished reading I was left wondering if the story even happened at all. If you are one that likes to leave things to your imagination then you would enjoy this book, otherwise I might suggest picking another book to read.
B0000DZEA1|5.0|The Return of the King soundtrack is probably just as good as Fellowship in my opinion. Haunting melodies and a bittersweet yet beautiful song by Annie Lennox at the end to finish it off make this CD a worthwhile addition to any collection. Howard Shore has outdone himself. Listening to it makes one want to see the movie immediately! : )
0684800713|4.0|By utilizing his characters and their actions, Earnest Hemingway does an exceptional job at portraying the carefree, aimless life of the Lost Generation in The Sun Also Rises.  Lady Brett Ashley represents women who are liberated, who have numerous admirers and sexual partners yet do not feel any compulsion to commit to them.  Women like Brett are very independent and often utilize men to fulfill their necessities and empty, meaningless lives.  Jake, Cohn, Mike, and Bill represent men of the 1920's who are psychologically and morally confused, and who drink, travel, and engage themselves in miscellaneous entertaining activities in order to escape from reality and their inner selves.  None of the characters are happy with their dispositions, yet find means of suppressing and ignoring their feelings of un-fulfillment and misery exemplified very well by Jake's statement, \\"It was like certain dinners I remember from the war.  There was much wine, an ignored tension, and a feeling of things coming that you could not prevent from happening.  Under the wine I lost the disgusted feeling and was happy\\"(150).<BR>One prevalent theme, which intrigued me, is the power and destructiveness of sex.  Due to an injury as a result of the war, Jake is left impotent and is therefore sorrowful, depressed, frustrated, and insecure.  Knowing this, Brett shies away from a relationship with him, despite the fact that they mutually share strong feelings for one another.  Additionally, her reckless sexuality invokes jealousy, bitter disputes, violence, and ultimately, the ruination of friendships.  Ironically, I believe she is a victim herself of insatiable desire for pleasure, and by her charm and beauty.  Although I cannot relate, I never failed to be captivated by her strength and the fierce drama of their senseless lives.<BR>I highly recommend this novel to those seeking to be entertained by a vividly painted and beautifully told story of a group of friends living their lives to the utmostextent in a time when it seems there are no consequences to one's actions, and where affection, purpose, and sincere happiness is almost non-existent.
B000002UJQ|5.0|Musically, the perfect mediator between the traditional (yet original) rock-pop of The Bends and the experimental, atmospheric Kid A. In the same way, it is also the perfect mix of Pablo Honey's youthful innocence and Hail to the Thief's overwhelming bitterness. Radiohead has had a diverse and at times nonchalant career (*cough* Amnesiac *cough*), but at its warm heart you find OK Computer. The music is uplifting and happy; the subjects are dark and sad. It is one of the catchiest and fun albums to listen to, yet Thom's obscurity gives it the edge to last and have significance over the overplayed drivel out there (in Radiohead terms, that would be Creep).<br />The only complaint I have with the album is the inclusion of Electioneering, a excellent song but one that isn't quite consistent with the rest of the album. Even so, the power and beauty of songs like Airbag and Lucky shine so greatly that even this isn't enough to give it less than 5 stars. No one can deny this from their music collection.
B0000E1WKE|5.0|i guess many of us are definitely making a huge mistake comparing this album to her works of the past decade- I don't know a vocalist, whose voice doesn't undergo any changes, especially after forty. It's neither better, nor worse- just different. Probably, instruments get older, but their master's skill and talent can only improve, as presented o the record. The selection of songs is perfect, and in my opinion the album should not be judged, but be listened to. Forget all the prejudices of yours, just relax and listen to the glorious prayer. O HOLY NIGHT is my favourite. To my mind she is the first singer ever to FEEL and EXPRESS the ESSENCE of Christmas. When I listen to the song I can feel, she is not only addressing God, but talking to Him. That's what's  it should be about - The SOUL,The Depth, The Beauty- all brilliantly expressed by Whitney. An absolute must have for anyone with ears and HEARTS!!! Whitney, u'r on ur way home- just dontcha turn back!..
B0000TB03W|5.0|I'm a huge Shania fan.  I'm so glad I got this DVD.  It's the perfect gift for anyone who enjoys good music and a great performer.
B0000TB050|5.0|I'm not a big U2 fan but this is an amazing concert DVD.  DTS is a must.  Full of energy and feeling.  Click to &quot;KITE&quot; turn it up and play it over and over again.
B0000TB03W|5.0|This is a great DVD, perfect for any Shania fan.  But even if you're not a fan, you'll become one after watching it.  The DVD has hit songs from Shania's previous CD's and from her latest one, UP! Get this DVD, you won't regret it.
B0000DD7NL|5.0|Wow. . . I never imagined that ANY artist, whether he/she was my favorite or not, would be able to create an album as grand as this.  Alicia Keys was my favorite from the time she released &quot;Fallin'&quot; and this CD definately cements her position.  Alicia &quot;backtracks&quot; (for a lack of a better term) to the times of Motown for this CD, but also makes every song her own.  From the beautiful, strong harmonies in &quot;If I Ain't Got You&quot; (my personal favorite) to the Urban &quot;You Don't Know My Name&quot;, &quot;The Diary of Alicia Keys&quot; is a great sophomore album.  If you are a R&amp;B fan, or even if you are not, you would be crazy not to give this CD a listen.
B000002G60|5.0|Being a child of the new generation, I kinda swallowed all of Suzanne Vega's recordings into one full year of listening (even her latest stuff); each record being so richly layered and unique, I took my time with each and it was not easy to decide, but this record, 1996's Nine Objects Of Desire was most definitely my favorite.<br />For one, it's different; it's a jazz-tingled, blues sprinkled, funky instrumentalist love affair with seduction in general.  Each song is a short anecdote to passion; and this passion can be as exquisite, yet simple as a plum (My Favorite Plum), as supple as caramel during the envisioning of an intimate evening (Caramel), or a masculine figure to sweep her off her feet (Thin Man - a personal favorite due to its sheer exuberance); some of these songs denote so much sentiment that it makes you wonder how privileged Suzanne Vega was to feel these fundamentally rare emotions, or at least render such a rich retelling of them.<br />Nonetheless, the topper of the concept of the entire album is that they are really desires; she marvels in the sensations, but there is this prevailing emotion of yearning, which is how life is, for the most part.  The near 40 minutes that the album lasts will be like a breather, a snippet of the perfect erotic fantasy, the perfect evening, the perfect love affair, the perfect vocal savoring, even the perfect honeymoon.  The album really scratched an itch in me.  <br />Highlights:  Lolita, No Cheap Thrill, Casual Match, Caramel, Birthday, The World Before Columbus, and Thin Man.
B00003CXAE|5.0|My favorite feel good musical ever!! I have seen this movie about 12 times and I never get tired of singing along (I even bought the soundtrack!). The music, the sweet story line, and the nostalgia all make this a terific, uplifting movie. It's also funny to watch the stars of the film and think about everything they've done since Grease.<br />Ah, life was so much simpler at Rydell High...
B00008AOS5|1.0|This movie sssssuuuuuuuuucccccccckkkkkkkeeeeeeeddddd.  that is<BR>  right sucked. it was a sucker movie
B0000BWVCM|3.0|I loved the movie, but I would wait to buy the DVD.<BR>With the first X-Men movie, fox released a nice DVD set.  Then three months later they released the Delux edition version.  A few years later they released the 1.5 version.  After seeing Fox milk the fans for money three times, I'm going to wait at least a year or two before I buy X2 on DVD.

B00006RINF|5.0|I can't stop listening to this album. I've had it in continuous rotation for 3 months now and I still find myself singing along, air drumming, and bobbing my head at work. My co-workers are getting a little tired of it.<br />This is a brilliant album. Awesome hooks, fantastic vocals, operatic goth metal near perfection.
068484267X|1.0|This is the only book in many years that I decided I did not want to finish reading.  I'd heard how wonderful the book was and I actually enjoy slower, touching novels, but this one just didn't even seem worth the time I spent reading it.  I didn't think the writing was very good.  It was more like an endless, detailed list of all the tragedies that happened to these helpless kids and how no humane person ever tried to help them, especially their own parents and family.  It was excrutiating reading it, with no redeeming value anywhere in sight.
0804102988|3.0|Ah, to the days when publishers let you write a book longer than 384 pages!<br />This book essentially follows five different family's for a period of 10,000 years.  Each family has their own traits and talents that are passed through the generations. Rutherford sets out to create an epic masterpiece, but in rush (lol at 1000 pages!) to achieve that aim, he loses \\"heart\\".  I did not care about these people, but was kept at a distance.  The Wilsons, the Godfreys, the Masons, the Porteuses and Schockleys never really come to life for me.  The five families fates and fortunate interweave from primitive man to medieval Knights and ladies, through England's blood civil war to modern man.  The closer he get to modern man the more steam he seems to lose.<br />It's rich historical chronicle, that just misses.

B0000TB03W|5.0|Any Shania Twain fan will LOVE this DVD.  It shows how Shania interacts with her fans and band.  I was not crazy about Shania at first, but I liked some of her songs.  My husband liked her.  So I bought this DVD and she is assume.  I will diffently go to a Shania concert now.  Her band is so talented also.  This is a HIGH engery concert DVD.  She diffently made a FAN out of me.  If you are looking for a DVD you should buy this one.  Even if you are not certain about getting it, you will like it, I did.<BR>Posted by Rhonda McIntosh
B00006SFBD|3.0|Yeah, Yeah, I know its a two C.D. set (or at least it was supposed to be) and without its companion piece it seems incomplete. Don't get me wrong, I still absolutely love this piece of work, but it seems kind of unfinished... there aren't as many clean vocals here, which are really my favorite part of Opeth. The soft acoustical interludes in alot of their songs seem like almost like the calm in the middle of a hurricane. Mikael's growl will be heard over heavy almost thrash riffs, and then suddenly everything stops and an acoustic will start and Mikael will come in with the clean vocals, and its truely amazing. His growl is legendary, but his clean voice is absolutely AMAZING! Its these moments in their songs that make Opeth metals Pink Floyd. This is almost non existant on this CD. I think that seperating the two aspects of their music was an interesting venture, but in the end its these two styles of their music together that makes Opeth.but whatever. I still make a point to listen to the entire C.D. at least once a week. The riff at the end of Deliverance is hypnotising, and A Fair Judgement (the only song with lots of clean vocals) has one of the most amazing solo's I have ever heard, rivaling Dave Gilmores in \\"Comfortably Numb\\" for my favorite solo. Masters Apprentices, Wreath, and By The Pain I See In Others are straight up headbangers. The intro to BTPISIO sounds really good. Not my favorite Opeth, but still beats anything else out on the market.<br />One Word Review: Headbanger!
B0000508U6|5.0|I must say that this is really one of my favorite cds of all time.  I even had to buy another copy recently because I played out the first one I got in 2001.  That's a lot of listening, if you can imagine.  I really like Coldplay because I feel like listening to them really prepared me for the music I listen to now.  Radiohead is now a favorite of mine in addition to Coldplay, of course.  Coldplay is an easier-to-listen-to, toned down version of Radiohead, in my opinion.  So if you like Coldplay, definitely try out Radiohead's &quot;The Bends&quot;.  Still, no matter what, I would and always will prefer &quot;Parachutes&quot;.
B00008OLYN|4.0|...it doesn't work without its companion piece. I got this for my friends for his birthday after I got him into Opeth, and I've listened to it a couple of times over at his house. The music is extremely good, but, this side of Opeth really needs the Death Growl to really REALLY work. The switches between heavy headbanging riffs and soft acoustical passages is what I like the most about Opeth. They are my favorite band, and once again it is better than anything else out there, but it doesn't work without Mikaels other, brutal voice coming into play.<br />One Work Review: Pink Floydish (OK its two words, so what.)
B0000E1WKE|5.0|Regardless of the bad media that Whitney has recieved lately she steps above all that to give us a holiday album that will set a new standard for generations to come.  She breathes new life into old classics.  I've listened to this cd countless times and its by far one of my favorite cds this year.  Her voice is rich and has more depth then most are used to hearing from her but the quality of her voice is still MILES above any vocalist out there.  This is a great cd and reaffirms what I've always believed and that is that it is about the MUSIC!!!  Great job Whitney.
B0000DZ3IG|5.0|This is a wonderful 5* soundtrack filled with all manner of love songs.  It's great on its own, but then having the three distinctly Christmas songs at the very end captures the feel of the movie really well. And what a way to go out with a bang - &quot;All I Want For Christmas is You&quot; by Olivia Olson is perfect.
B00006F7S4|1.0|This is complete garbage.  Regression into the cliched lyrics and lackluster melodies that make mainstream music successful.  For a much better album, try &quot;Mutations&quot;.  For mediocrity, but this.
B00005JKCH|5.0|This was a great movie in many ways.  The hero and the villan were not too overly powerful (like superman or terminator 3).  It had a good ending and a great plot.  This movie is a perfect example of awsome movies because there was just enough action to keep your interest.  Defenitlly a movie to buy.
B000002J09|5.0|THIS limp bizkit fan is funny I was just reading some of his other reviews and he happened to review the NIRVANA best of album he reckons they copied Puddle of Mud. But how can you copy someone if you're music is 10 years older than theirs HA HA.<br />BY the way this Album is very important for rock very few other albums can be mentioned in the same breath
0345448898|5.0|This series presents a number of serious and deep issues, but does so in a fantastic, thrilling, and engrossing way.  I would recommend theses books to anyone who has an open mind and will not narrowly confuse a beautiful fantasy story with an attack on religion.<br />I think it raises some interesting points about religion, that's for sure.  As a Catholic I was impressed at the way some of the topics were presented but I never once thought it was an attack on religion.  It may have presented some criticims, but that is no reason to dismiss the book.  Rather it is a reason to read it and see if you agree or disagree, it will make you think.
B00008H2LB|1.0|linkin Park are the 2nd worst band in history only beaten by the great crap bizkit. F**k rap metal listen to hard rock grunge or punk just not this crap. Do yourselves a favour go to a store Buy NIRVANA - NEVERMIND LED ZEPPEILIN - IV AC/DC - BACK IN BLACK<BR>if you want something newer buy Foo Fighters. You will never be the same again
0811833887|5.0|This book is full of wonderful, imaginative illustrations that show the time and effort that was placed into Monsters Inc. The numerous different illustrators that have provided work make this collection of images a delight. There is very little text and explanation to go along with the images, but this is exactly what I was looking for. Its interesting to see how many changes the characters appearances went through to reach the final animated film. A definite buy for any fan of Pixar.
B0000DD7LB|5.0|Most of in the Zone is the work of some talented producers -- some up-and-comers and a few old hands -- and the heart of the album is a flashy hodgepodge of hip-hop beats and club tracks, a few of which will set butts a-grindin. In the Zone's first single, \\"Me Against the Music,\\" is a fine specimen of Britney 4.0-a fast-paced dance anthem, all grinding percussion shuttling through a traffic jam of synths. Most of the record's up-tempo bangers trace the single's footsteps, bopping raucously without slipping into chintzy faux rock or flavorless hip-hop. Gone are the spare Neptunes beats of Britney, replaced by a hectic sonic pileup. Spears hits pay dirt on \\"Toxic,\\" holding her own against a wall of drum breaks, strings, and James Bond surf guitar that warps and struts like it's been fed into the Matrix.
B00007ELEL|4.0|No movie has entertained me more in the past few years than this film. Jon Goodman and Jeff bridges are paired perfectly to produce a hilarious movie. The Coen Brothers have out done themselves once again. You almost forget that other great stars appear in this movie, including Julianne Moore, Steve Buscemi, John Turturro and Philip Seymour Hoffman. I highly recommend this film along with any other Coen brother film.
0385504209|5.0|I just finished &quot;The DaVinci Code&quot;, and I must say, it's the best book I've read in a while.  While I'm not going to call it &quot;great literature&quot;, it's a fast paced thriller/mystery that keeps you turning the pages long after you should have turned the lights out.
B000089CJI|5.0|i was first a fan of death cab for cutie, the lead singer ben gibbard's other band, when a friend introduced me to the postal service.  iw asn't sure if i would enjoy the more techno, less indie, sound, but i fell in love with this album and has been my favorite since i bought it when it was first released.  definetly their best work.  i highly reccomend this to anyone who enjoys good music, and is willing to give a different sound a chance.  the first, second, and third time through may sound too different for your taste but i am confident that you will come to enjoy it as much as i have.
B0000TB03W|5.0|she sings most all of her new songs and a lot of the songs from her come on over album, but only 3 from the woman in me. shes getting more and more towards pop. but its all good, she puts on the greatest shows.
B0000DD7NL|5.0|This is a great album done by Alicia keys.Great songs,great album.Well Done Alicia.
B0000TB03W|5.0|Singing all her hits, with all her live energy and band EVERYTHING IS LIVE this is no lipsinging. she makes you part of the show. this is a great christmas dvd get it for your friends.
B000089RVX|4.0|First off I would just like to say the Cd is great and I wouldn't think twice about purchasing it. Amy who is the lead singer of the band has an amazing and beautiful voice and should not be over looked. My only problem is with the song &quot;My Immortal&quot;. I love the song don't get me wrong, but the version on the cd is not like the one used in the video and that made me quite upset! The song is exactly the same in both versions until the ending when in the video (which i loved)they played a little more uptembo ending verse which on the cd it's softer. I like both versions but prefered the video version better and it's not on the cd. THE only reason why I rated it 4 stars instead of 5 is because of this, other than that it's an amazing cd. If anyone out there can explain why this is or where I can get that version, please write a review and let me know, thank you!!!!
B0000TB03W|5.0|i just got done watching this dvd it is awesome she has people that get married and little girls in the audience sing. she is very audience oriented which makes a good performer. BUY THIS
B0000VCZK2|5.0|Having been a huge fan of the Alien series since I was thirteen this set is the definitive collection for the series. Offering seperate versions for each of the films and the biggest collection of bonus materials I've seen since &quot;Terminator 2 Ultimate Edition&quot;. My favorite is &quot;Aliens&quot; and to finally have commentary for this film is excellent. Buy this set and I gaurantee you will be satisfied.
0385504209|3.0|I found the subject matter of this book most interesting  and fascinating but as a thriller I thought it was very average. In my view the book has been highly overrated
B00006LLOB|4.0|Although Mr.Wolf may be past his prime on this one there's still more than enough fire in his belly to make these songs fly.  Apparently there was some friction between Wolf and the english super star rockers during the recording of this cd?  And at one point you hear Howlin belittling Eric Clapton by telling him all ya gotta do is count it off?  Some great moments on this offering and for my money Highway 49 tops the bill here.  Although Sittin on top of the World and Poor Boy ain't half bad either.
B00005KHJM|5.0|&quot;The Wicker Man&quot; was always a bit of a disappointment to me because long before I got a chance to watch the movie, I accidentally learned how it ended. Therefore, the final devastating moments of this Christopher Lee/Edward Woodward horror-drama lacked the punch it probably has for most viewers who go into &quot;The Wicker Man&quot; totally unaware. Try to avoid learning a lot about this movie before you watch it because I assure you that you will be much happier with the results. Imagine a film about paganism and the philosophical implications of a modern day Christian encountering such a primitive religion, with all of its attendant rituals and colorful ceremonies, alive and well on a Scottish isle and you have the basic premise of this haunting movie. &quot;The Wicker Man&quot; is considered by many to be one of the greatest cult horror films ever made, and while I don't think this claim is necessarily true, I still found much to like here.<br />Police Sergeant Neil Howie arrives on a small island off the coast of Scotland on a mission to follow up an anonymous tip he received about a missing girl. We learn right from the start that the police sergeant is a devout, no nonsense Christian, but even he isn't prepared for the weirdness running rampant through the byways of this community. Right from the start, things on Summerisle seem downright weird. The locals drinking in the pub where Howie procures lodgings are extremely strange folk, as is Willow, the daughter of the inn owner. That very night the police sergeant has an erotic encounter with Willow that is sure to test the faith of the most ardent Christian. Further eeriness rears its head when Howie sees strange goings on at the local school, some of the bizarre customs practiced on the island, and finally meets with the wild haired eccentric Lord Summerisle. It turns out that most people don't seem all that concerned about the missing girl Howie is looking for. Howie rapidly goes from a state of perplexity to one of utter repugnance as he gradually learns the true secrets of the this island: the people here, led by the zealous Lord Summerisle, are practicing pagans who emphatically reject the Christianity so adored by Howie. But as much as the police sergeant thinks he knows, he is in for a very rude awakening as the movie twists and turns to its grim conclusion.<br />&quot;The Wicker Man&quot; is a very colorful movie, with plenty of dancing, singing, and great costumes. The music is quite unique, at least for me, and plays a big part throughout the picture. What I liked best about this film was the cast. Britt Ekland turns up in the small role of Willow, the pagan temptress who tries to seduce Howie with a rather sultry dance in the beginning of the film. Christopher Lee is a bit of a question mark here. In an interview included on the disc, he claims that &quot;The Wicker Man&quot; was the best role he ever had in a movie. Moreover, he loved the film so much that he personally called film critics in order to help get the film some much needed publicity. Most of what Lee says about his part in this production is a bit of surprise because his character really doesn't appear in many scenes of the film, and when he does show up, he doesn't really do much. Apparently, some missing footage contained several lengthy scenes of Lee as Lord Summerisle, so perhaps this helps explain his limited screen time. The real prize in the film is Edward Woodward in the role of Neil Howie. Like most people, the only exposure I have had with this actor was his stint in the American television series &quot;The Equalizer&quot; a few years ago. In &quot;The Wicker Man,&quot; Woodward shines as the hard-nosed Howie, a dedicated cop who adequately conveys the sort of outrage concerning the shenanigans on Summerisle one would expect from a deeply religious man. Even though I knew how the film ended, Howie's reactions to his fate still chilled me to the bone. Woodward alone provides thebiggest reason you should watch this movie. What a fine actor.<br />The DVD version of the film boasts an impressive array of extras, specifically interviews with principals Edward Woodward, Christopher Lee, and some background about director Robin Hardy and screenwriter Anthony Schaffer. You even get some information about the conditions endured by cast and crew alike as they filmed the project (poor, poor Edward Woodward and that scared goat!). The controversy surrounding the distribution of the film, which the studio cut and sloppily marketed, is discussed in some detail. Christopher Lee still looks mad over the missing footage, which he claims is probably in someone's basement or attic waiting to be found. The official explanation is that a mistake made while cleaning out a film vault resulted in parts of this film being thrown in the back of a dump truck. Even if this enigmatic footage never surfaces, the film I saw was still massively entertaining. I cannot say that this is the best picture I have ever seen, but its reputation requires all cinema fans to give it a watch. It's definitely unique enough to stand out in the old memory banks well after the closing credits fade to black. Any film that can accomplish that feat is worthy of a five star rating, wouldn't you saybiggest reason you should watch this movie.

B0000E1WKE|1.0|the people on here who say that whitney's voice is just as strong as ever are nothing more than die-hard fans who don't want to except the truth. whitney's constant drug abuse has clearly taken its toll on the diva's once flawless voice, making it very raspy and scratchy, a problem that she never had to worry about.<br />for those who have heard whitney's live performances as of late (especially the disgustingly horrific performances from VH1's 2003 Diva Duets) that is exactly what she sounds like on this album, only with the digital enhancements which still don't do any justice to the crystalline voice she used to have.<br />its such a shame that somebody so gorgeous and so talented has allowed drugs to ruin her life, and the worst part is she is still using, regardless of what she says.
B000002VMH|5.0|Hey Annie Lennox fans do you remember sometime back in the early 90's, The Grammy's, when Annie Lennox lost Best Female Artist to Mariah(Scary)Carey, well I sure as hell do. I'll never forget it! I was flabbergasted! I thought they said A-R-T-I-S-T! isn't that someone who writes their own songs, sings the vocals (including the backing vocals), writes their own music, or produce their own music, or plays an instrument. How could someone actually win an award for best artist when all they do is sing someone else's material. How naive of me...I've not watched the show since and I never will, Thank God.  Annie Lennox's \\"Diva\\" is creatively superior, sweepingly constructed, brilliantly written, musically flawless and the singing beautiful and enrapturing and she did it all, it's timeless!, and what a stunning achievement it is. Funny thing is?... I hear \\"Diva\\" more now than when it was first released, unlike Mariah's much honored first album which sadly... hasn't been heard from since, like her...it went the way of the Dinosaurs... PITY.
B000002KBU|5.0|In the late sixties and early seventies, a new style of music began to evolve.  Coming from the sixties folk music of Joan Baez, The Kingston Trio, and similar artists, Simon and Garfunkel headed up this musical movement, and quickly transformed folk into a more pop-oriented singer/songwriter style.<BR>  But Simon and Garfunkel only started the movement.  When they split in 1970, Paul Simon released his first solo album, in a full-fleged singer/songwriter album.  But George Harrison's \\"All Things Must Pass\\" would become the first great singer/songwriter album.  Since then, the style has given us over 30 years of classic albums.<BR> But to find the greatest of these albums, we go back to the early years of the movement, in 1971.  This is when Joni Mitchell released \\"Blue.\\"  Though not considered her greatest album, that title belongs to \\"Court and Spark,\\" \\"Blue\\" is Joni's greatest folk album; \\"Court and Spark\\" is done in much more of a folk-jazz album.<BR> The album begins with \\"All I Want,\\" a simple folky tune, which is one of the most lighthearted moments on the album, and is accompanied only by guitar.The album moves on to \\"My Old Man,\\" which, though not a light-hearted number, has a positive outlook.  This number is accompanied only on piano.  Every song on the album follows in one of these two fashions: there is not a single percussion instrument, and there is no mix: every song is either piano or guitar.<BR> Third is \\"Little Green,\\" a dark number accompanied by guitar, which focuses on adoption.  The lyrics in this are sung quietly and subdued, and helps the listener slip into the album.  Then comes \\"Carey,\\" the most popular song from the album, and the most lighthearted.  This is also accompanied by guitar, and is a bittersweet love song.<BR> The first side of the album closes with the title track, \\"Blue,\\" one of the darkest singer/songwriter songs in existence, and also is the darkest song on the album.  Surprisingly, the song is a love song, consoling somebody who is clearly depressed, hence the title.  The song is accompanied by sparse piano chords.<BR> Side two of the classic album begins with \\"California,\\" another popular hit, which is another bittersweet song concerning a return home from Europe.  Supposedly, Joni penned the entire album while vacationing in Europe.  Next is \\"This Flight Tonight,\\" one of the most lively songs on the album, while it's tone is dark and depressing.  The gons is accompanied by piano.<BR> Eighth on the album is \\"River,\\" a very dark song which brilliantly juxtapositions depression with Christmas.  Ninth is \\"A Case Of You,\\" a popular favorite, which is also very lighthearted, accompanied by guitar, and written seemingly half for a loved one and half for Joni's home, Canada.  She makes allusions of love to wine in this folky album track.  Finally is \\"The Last Time I Saw Richard,\\" a song which brilliantly closes the album as an epic folk classic.<BR> \\"Blue\\" is by far the greatest singer/songwriter album of all time, and is a must have for any fan of any kind of music, as it is electric, satisfying, and fulfilling.
B00004BZ0N|5.0|With London Calling, the Clash veered away from traditional punk rock and took their experimentation of other musical styles to new heights. In fact, after hearing their first two albums, one might wonder if it's even the same band playing, and because of this, 'true punks' often like to denounce this album. <br />But while this album explores a lot of new territory for the Clash, it still manages to incorporate all the messages of social and political change that punk is famous for, and pulls them all off remarkably well. There is not a single song on this album that I can fault, they are all produced to a point where they sound perfect and still raw enough to appeal to most of the punk crowd. <br />If you have any interest in punk, or just rock in general, I urge you to pick up this album, you will not be disappointed. This is one of the few 'classic' albums that actually lives up to the hype, and is a must in almost any CD collection.<br />I've always believed that the Clash are the most talented band to ever emerge from the punk scene, and London Calling certainly proves that fact. Quite simply, this is a masterpiece.
B000084T18|2.0|I will start this off by saying that I grew up listening to gangsta rap and all types of old school hip hop.  <BR>The ONLY good parts about this album are some of the beats (Dre made) and that he disses on murda inc. (I cant stand ja rule either!)<BR>That's why he got 2 stars.  That's it.  50 cent needs to actually open his mouth all of the way when he raps(sounds like his teeth; bottom and top are touching when he spits lyrics.  It puts me to sleep.  <BR>Plus I think the part about this that bothers me the most is that his songs get WAAAYYY too much radio play and I seriously want to throw my stereo out my 2nd story window when I hear his same song 10x's in 2 hrs!!!  <BR>To sum it up, good beats with a bad lyricist make a BAD rap record; bad beats with a great lyricist make a good record and tight a$$ beats with heavy bass, a great lyricist, and great placement of songs make a GREAT rap record; all of what this album misses.  <BR>Dre, try to get MC Ren to do an album with your production please!!!!  Put a great lyricist that truly deserves recognition for his influence on top for once.  I would love to hear him on the radio instead of 50 cent.
B0000DD7NL|1.0|WOW.. WHAT A WAIST OF MONEY, HOPEFULLY I CAN GET A FULL REFUND OR STORE CREDIT.. TALK ABOUT A GREAT CD TO SLEEP TO! BORING!!!!   ELEPHANT MAN'S.. GOOD 2 GO IS BETTER THEN THIS CRAP.
B00003CXHJ|2.0|First off, as a US Vietnam Vet I'd like to apologize to our British cousins for the audacity of Hollywood in pretending that the US captured the first enigma device in WWII. <br />But then after seeing an episode of the series &quot;MI-5&quot; on A&amp;E I'd like to withdraw 1/3 of the apology. Hollywood, by no means, has a corner on producing jingoistic claptrap. Another 1/3 of the apology gets withdrawn because of decades of the gutter-crawling British press blaming the US for everything wrong in the world from global warming (whoops, doesn't exist) to tooth decay. And the final 1/3 gets withdrawn after seeing Hollywood movies like &quot;Gunga Din&quot; and &quot;King of the Khyber Rifles&quot; that depict the British Army, along with the East India Company, as benefactors of India and Afghanistan. I won't even try to get into the British opium trade in China vs the fantasy special &quot;55 Days in Peking&quot;. So let's stop the finger pointing. Glass houses and all that, y'know, old chaps.<br />As for U-571.<br />I found too much of the movie to be irritating. If you've ever been on a WWII-era submarine you'd know just how claustrophobic those boats were. Naturally the constraints of movie making make it impossible to build an accurate set and still film in it. However the cavernous interior of U-571 was laughable. I mean you could have run laps in the control room.<br />And then the depiction of the Exec was ridiculous. The US Navy in WWII was run by professionals. Any officer has been through  at least OCS and one of the most important things taught is the importance of the mission and the possible necessity of ordering men to near certain death. There were no submarine service execs who weren't fully qualified officers with sufficient experience. Any officer who was as easy going as the one McConaughey depicts would never have made exec in the first place. Even if he were soft he would still know basic facts of command.<br />There were no black Americans serving on submarines in WWII. Leave it to the rampant PCism of Hollywood to require the token black... even when to do so is ludicrously inaccurate. Seeing how nuts Hollywood has gone in PCism lately we should consider oureselves fortunate that there isn't a woman crewmember aboard.<br />Generally the movie is entertaining, though it mainly uses well-worn plot devices. What can you do besides have mechanical problems, run low on breathable air, run low on battery charge and get depth-charged?
B0000CFW87|1.0|I have nothing against Josh. He has a good voice, but sadly, this album is no better than his first one. The selection of songs are so similar to his previous album, and its kinda like a repetition. Nothing as changed. Personally, I find this album boring, and prefered his first cd . Sorry Josh.

B0000DD7NL|4.0|Alicia finally becomes a part of the \\"Real Soul Sistas\\" club. <BR>When I first got her debut album, I thought that was \\"Soul\\"\\", but now I reckon it's soul mixed with commercialism. And that ain't Real! See you get a great different opinion of soul after hearing Jill Scott's debut, India.Arie, Lauryn Hill and Angie Stone. <br />This album is different. It doesn't have many ballads or \\"Streets of NY\\". I'm disappointed. But it does have some great songs such as \\"Karma\\"-a song about a break-up/make-up. \\"Heartburn\\"& \\"You Don't Know My Name\\" are songs about relationships with great melodies. But her debut single is really bad compared to her other songs and her debut. <br />One of the most interesting tracks on the album is \\"Dragon Days\\" -a song about a fairy-tale? Alicia are you serious? It does have a great hook and chorus, but I don't get it. \\"Diary\\" the song is so boring. \\"Wake Up\\" awakens the album when it's starts dying. Then it dies again with the \\"aparantly Alicia wanted to make a fresh-flavored track\\" \\"Slow Down\\" -written by Jill Scott co-writters. <br />\\"Ain't Got U\\" is such a sweet ballad. Something I expected from Alicia's album. It's very soulful and very simple. That's the beauty of it. I'm dissappointed that there wasn't a more better ballad on the album. <br />The final track -where's Streets of New York with Nas and Rakim -I was looking forward to that song. \\"Nobody Not Really\\" is like \\"Never Felt This Way\\" from her debut, but is linked to the intro. The final song really disappoints me, it's like \\"Miseducation of Lauryn Hill\\" song. <br />The album is much better than Alicia Keys' \\"Songs in A minor\\", which i ranked 5/5. But back then my standards were low. On a CD it said \\"Alicia Keys\\" my ranking would be 10/5. <br />What it lacks is firstly: a great debut like woulda/coulda/shoulda song: \\"Streets of NY\\", <BR>2nd: Lead songs. <BR>3rd: Ballads <BR>4th: There is no theme to the album. She should've added some more songs in to make the theme of the album clearer! <br />Still I hope everyone buys this album. I hope it'll win Grammy's R&B Album of the Year.
B00009TB5G|5.0|Anyone reading this already knows what the Lord of the Rings is all about - so relating specifically to this 4-DVD set, one word: AMAZING!<br />The LOTR DVD collectors sets have to go down in the short history of DVD's as the greatest collection ever. Even for the casual, non-geeked out fan, this set is worth it for the extra forty minutes of cut scenes not shown in the movie version.  Watching the extended DVD will make the entire trilogy experience more satisfying.<br />Those who are fans of the book and obsessed with the movies will agree with me that the additional scenes bring the movie truer to the novel.<br />In the end, the additional 40 minutes and the four commentary tracks, not to mention the two additional dvds (mostly for the LOTR geeks like myself) are well worth the additional ten dollars over the single dvd version released in the summer of 2003.
B00009M6VJ|4.0|The Life of David Gale is by far one of the greatest movies I have ever seen. It incorporates everything you can ask for in a movie into one edge-of-your-seat thriller. Academy Award winner Kevin Spacey (David Gale, American Beauty) and Oscar Nominee Kate Winslet (Bitsey Bloom, Titanic) star in this powerful film. David Gale is one of the leading activists for Death Watch, an anti-death activists group. After making a faulty decision at a party, Gale's reputation is scared for the rest of his life. This movie had many high points and a few low points to go with it. I believe that many people are not giving this movie the credit it deserves. <BR> Gale is a College Philosophy Professor before his reputation is tarnished and is looked upon as a different person. David is accused of rape and murder and is sentenced to the death penalty in Texas. Gales wish is to have reporter Betsey Bloom cover his story four days before he is to be executed. During those final four days, Betsey Bloom tries to discover the truth and has to decide if Gale is in fact being truthful or in fact lying. Betsy, along with her intern reporter Zack (Gabriel Mann) work together very uniquely through many jaw-dropping scenes to an even more astonishing conclusion. <BR> Some of the points about this movie that I felt were very well done include the eye-popping conclusion and the chronological order of events. I very much admire the way this particular films plot went in no obvious order. Flashbacks are always a great device to use in movies, and have a very powerful effect. The conclusion is the best part of this movie, hands down. If you don't enjoy any part of this movie, you cannot deny the power of the ending scenes.<BR> The low point in \\"The Life of David Gale\\" that really sticks out in my mind is the acting. Kevin Spacey did an amazing job playing a man on death row. The only time his acting was questionable was when he is drunk roaming around the neighborhood. Kate Winslet's performance wasgood as a reporter, except when she is obviously over doing it a little bit. I may say this is the low point in the movie, but that's only because the movie is nearly flawless. <BR> The power of this movie isn't only about what you see on the big screen. You have to look deeper into what the movie is getting at. Putting your life on the line for a good cause, speaking up for what you believe in, and finding out the real truth behind any story. This movie not only depicts our modern day society and teaches us a lesson about ourselves, but provides a very entertaining way of learning. This is a four star movie and I give it two thumbs up.
B00005JKJA|5.0|I've got kind of a love/hate thing with David Lynch movies. I've seen all of his movies numerous times, but I admit, with every movie like this he puts out, I'm stumped the 1st time watching it. Once I get it, I think &quot;another one of these??? argh!!&quot;. But I can't help myself. I love his work, even if it makes me want to slap him silly for creating ludicrous puzzles out of simple plots (which is an artform in and of itself he's mastered). To anyone else who still can't quite figure it out, the biggest clues to what this movie is REALLY about, I won't provide a spoiler here, just offer a few clues.<br />1. Pay attention to the camera closing in on the red pillow at the opening credits<br />2. Notice what happens immediatley after Rita opens the blue box<br />3. Notice the distinct differences in the charachters before the blue box is opened, and after (most notably, the director)<br />4. The very last scene at the end of the movie.

B00000ILDE|5.0|I'm not much of a Sci-Fi movie fan, but this one blew me away. The writing, acting and directing are phenomenial. Suspenseful from beginning to end, it will keep you on the tip of your loveseat. It is one of my favorite all time movies - one I've watched about a dozen or so times. Trust all the glowing reviews you've read here. If you don't have this movie, get it. You will not regret it!
B0000E1WNV|1.0|Hey Bruce, Merry Christmas Baby you sure did treat us BAD. You know when word leaked out that this Holiday season we would be treated to a full show DVD and the Essentials CD with a bonus disc I literally counted down the days. Now I'm counting the cash left in my wallet because someone just held me up without a gun! I feel like Chevy Chase at the end of Vacation when Wally World was closed! We buy his toys, we watch his show, he owes us! Well the same can be said here for both of these Holiday Cash-ins. Bruce, the champion of the everyman, clearly had little to do with these sub-par releases that bear his name and photo. How else can you explain the lack of quality control across the board? Correct me but doesn't re-mastering mean that this should be better than the old dog chow? The 5.1 surround sound is so shoddy that it makes the clicking interruption on an old 8 track far more acceptable. If that isn't bad enough, I have to wait 6-8 weeks for Sony to send me a replacement on Disc 2 of the DVD. Bruce has a very loyal fan-base that drowns him in adulation night after night. His shows are legendary and he deserves all of the praise heaped upon him. It's for those reasons and those reasons alone that he should care more about the products that hit the marketplace. If he keeps taking us for granted we should have this printed on our wallets and purses: \\"Sorry folks, we're closed, the moose outside should have told you!\\"

B0000AGWJ7|5.0|For anyone into black, thrash, death, hardcore and doom metal this is the release for you.  These guys take the old Iron Maiden sound and meld it with the brutality of death metal.  They don't try to sound like all the In Flames or At the Gates copy cats.  In fact the band at times sounds like Amorphis.  Especially when the lead singer uses his clean vocals.  There are also parts with in the song where the bass playing sounds like something from Helmet or Corrosion of Comformity.  In other words it not all out Thrash.  There are division of parts in each song where it goes from death, doom, hardcore and back to death.  It's the best arrangement I have ever heard from a band trying to meld so many styles together and it gives the band their own sound.  I'm glad there is something good like this coming out of Orange County CA. This is going to be my top rated album for 2003.
B00004TS0E|5.0|Let me say two things. <BR>1.  I love old movies. <BR>2.  I mistrust remakes. <BR>However, I loved this remake.  It has become a regular part of our Christmas for the past 10 years.  My wife loves it and I do as well.  Get it now!!
B0000DYJM6|5.0|For any Pearl Jam fan this CD is a must. It's a great collection of songs that span their entire career. I also love how each song has its own story and the band tells you about them inside the booklet. The two CD's are split up. CD 1 is fast paced and CD 2 slows it down. Stand outs on 1 are U, Alone, and the Stone Gossard sung Don't Gimme No Lip. CD 2 is remarkable. Stand outs are Footsteps (pick up the Jeremy single for this track also) Fatal, Other Side, and Sweet Lew is a very interesting song sang by Jeff Ament. If you don't own any pearl jam cd's pick up some studio albums first, then get this one, it's well worth it.
B0000TB03W|5.0|The Chicago Show is Shania's first concert in the states in 2 and a half years. The show is fast paced and full energy. Shania interacts a lot with the crowd. The band is by her side a lot mostly because Shania likes it that way. The songs are a mix of her past hits and some off the new album. The editing could have been better. Overall, I truly believe any Shania fan will enjoy this dvd.
B0000DIXDR|5.0|I can say this is my all time favorite movie of all times. This is a movie that I can watch over and over again, without getting tired of watching it. I highly recommend this movie to everyone.
B0000TB03W|5.0|A must for all Shania fans. A joy to watch as Shania makes her way through the crowd. Shania's dancing could use some work lol.<BR>The energy never fails. Songs easy to sing along to. Yes, for any fan this dvd is the perfect stocking stuffer.

B0000TB03W|5.0|The chicago show is a pleasure for any fan to watch. Shania's songs are catchy. The older songs stand out better, but in time the new songs will catch on more. There are great pyro-techs. The crowd sings along plenty and seems really into the show. How could any fan not add this to their collection
1587990717|5.0|i read this book twice and i have to say that is was even more entertaining the second time than it was the first.   true taleb sometimes gets into some bombast but he does not seem to take himself as seriously as other egomaniacs and he comes across as an entertaining fellow at the same time completely absorbed into his mapping of a world stripped of cognitive illusions.   there are so many things in this book one takes for granted that it questions then one realizes \\"hey I've been telling myself these things\\" but it is surprising how one forgets them (genetics of humans not made to introspect I guess is part of the message). taleb's point is that we are not made to understand probability yet have to live in a world with which we have a genetic mismatch.  one part of the entertainment is the following people taleb seems to take pleasure  trouncing:  1- rich traders who think that they are smart but in fact were lucky --the category extends to the rich businessmen who find causes to their success  2- journalists like george will (why so much dumping on george will?)  who think they see a cause when there is none  3-  people who read the press and think that they understand the world simply from seeing connections between things that may or may not have a connection  4- scientists who are not popperian -i.e. without self-doubt  5- taleb- taleb v/s taleb engaging in a war brain-genes. taleb trounces taleb though not as convincingly  now i happen to know the author and all i have to say is that he is just like the book --though he has very very smooth personal manners ...

0780020685|5.0|Farmers find themselves living in fear, knowing that their harvest will come and that thirty bandits will drift in soon after and claim it. They know that this will leave them nothing, too, and that the already meager lives they lead might soon come to a closing. So, in order to keep what is theirs, they opt to do what any rational farmer would do. They go to recruit themselves four samurai that would be willing to work for no glory, three meals a day, and for the knowledge that they are doing something grand. Thus it begins...<br />When I was a kid and watched Seven Samurai, I always enjoyed the theme being presented. I liked the thought of those Samurai taking a village set in the middle of a defensive wasteland, with fields on one side and approachable mountains on the other, and seeing how seven try to even the odds with thirty. I also liked the introduction of each character as they were meticulously blended into a story that carried itself for well over 200 minutes, crafting a tune for every flavor you would care to see. After picking it up this release some year later, however, I found something in the story I had missed when I was younger. I actually listened to the dialogue and absorbed the words being stated, saw the games being played and the poses for wince they came, and I noticed for the first time that this movie wasn't a story on nobility. It was a story on players and the chess games played behind the scenes. And that made me like this movie all the more.<br />While sitting the table with a well-rounded cast, an enemy that isn't simply something to wholesale slaughter, and tactical maneuvering from the most unlikely of places, Seven Samurai actually sets a viewer down and submerges them in a world that they think they know at first. It introduces the supposed &quot;good&quot; and the opposing &quot;evil,&quot; letting you taste the reasoning of those joining in the protection of those farmers. It also shows you their struggles and how hard it is to find an &quot;honest&quot; Samurai willing to help them, highlighting what it takes to live. In the process of definement moving away from that, however, it goes a step beyond that little gambit and it shows you that little world in a way you rarely see it. Here, the lines of &quot;love,&quot; &quot;good,&quot; &quot;ill,&quot; and &quot;helplessness&quot; are all blurred as an in-depth game is showcased and exposed. And that makes it truly stand apart from many films I've seen in my life.<br />Its really hard to find fault in this film unless you're looking for something short and easy to decipher. It does take its time in showing you all the details, in crowning its cast, and in illustrating the true art in war. That's really the beauty of the film, too, and is recommended to those wanting more from their movie than killing and faceless lines. This is what I would honestly go so far as to call &quot;a classic.&quot;find an &quot;honest&quot; Samurai willing to help them, highlighting what it takes to live.

B0000DD7NL|5.0|I have to admit that I bought this album on the strength of the single ('You Don't Know My Name') and reviews in The Times. I know next to nothing about the artist, and I'm probably far too old to understand all the nuances of her lyrics. But the music -- the tunes -- on this CD are really wonderful. It looks set to appear in many a 'Holidays' stocking -- for those who have the patience to wait three more weeks.<br />Given the single, and given the CD cover, I had been expecting Alicia's piano to be given greater prominence in the mix, such as it is. Is it just me, or has the production of this album been a deliberately low-tech AM-friendly affair? The melody of the single harks back to Marvin Gaye's classic 'What's Going on?', and the production seems equally muffled. Another example: on track #10, 'So Simple', Alicia has added some prerequisite scratching, which has been done a thousand times since Madonna's 'Erotica'.<br />Alicia's band is pretty small. There does not seem to be a drummer -- despite the frequent appearance of drums on most tracks -- so we must assume that drums come courtesy of 'digital programming'. This music is far more cerebral than Beyonce, who also uses a tiny musical team. Neither, to my ear, quite approaches the standard set by Jimmy Jam / Terry Lewis for Alexander O'Neal's 'Hearsay'.<br />But this is a great album to end 2003 on.
B000059QY2|4.0|The music is wonderful particularly the contrapuntal lines... the lyrics are profound too. Vixwell is superb and he simply eclipsed young Pavaratti: he alone is worthy of every cent of the price. This is an opera filmed with real settings and excellent acting as though it's a movie. It's so easy to follow the story.<br />The picture is far from striking but is nonetheless acceptable, but don't expect too much from the recorded sound, albeit that it's good enough to carry the beauty of Vixwell's and Grunberova's singing. Credit should also be given to Vienna Philharmonic under Chailly which mixed every sound so well.  <br />This DVD is a whole rather impressing. It's a shame that EMI haven't remastered it.
B0000DZEA1|4.0|Over here in the UK, the soundtrack of 'The Fellowship of the Ring' is still doing incredibly well in the Classical charts.  Listening to it again, it's impossible not to be struck by the variety of themes and genres laid down in that first part of the trilogy.<br />To my ears, 'The Two Towers' simply presented variations on a theme.  There weren't enough entirely new melodies, and the OST was as disappointing as the movie itself.  (Thankfully all the narrative problems in the cinematic release have been fixed in the extended DVD edition.)  Shore seemed to want to make the movie awash with music, in much the same way that Williams overfilled the more recent 'Star Wars' films.<br />In many ways, 'The Return of the King' offers further variations on a theme.  But it does this magnificently, and it winds up the whole saga brilliantly.  What I particularly like is at the end of the very final track, we hear a wonderful reference to another Ring Cycle -- i.e. the floating violins leitmotiv of Wagner's 'Das Rheingold'.<br />I don't think we can pretend that this album will still be regarded as a classic in 50 years' time.  But as a result of this OST, I am immensely looking forward to the movie itself.
B00000IBVC|4.0|As a Chinese with some idea about Chinese history and culture, I have the following reservations:<br />1) The Forbidden City-- the setting of the play-- was built in the wake of Ming Dynasty and was only used as the Imperial Palace in early Ching. The costume here is neither Ming or Ching, nor any suggestion of a mixture. The Palace anyway has completely faded and virtually colourless, making a stark contrast with the bright and colourful costumes. <br />2) The Chinese Kung Fu Scene ( as well as a number of other scenes for embellishment ) is totally unnecesary and the performer's costume in particular is peculiar. We also have too much zoom-ins and zoom-outs and then diversions (in the form of montages?) into irrelevant Chinese spectacular scenes or images like various shots of the Great Wall or other scenes taken from the Forbidden City itself, just to remind viewers that this is China. These may distract and annoy some viewers.<br />3) The actors acting and singing with full facial and body expressions in such costumes and in such make-ups ( particularly their funny beards or unnatural finger gestures) look funny to oriental eyes. Madame Butterfly ( the one with the Japanese singer ) is doing much better in these aspects.<br />4) More often than not, the setting is flooded with people, peole from both sides, people from everywhere: perhaps typical of any Chinese scene. But does it really help in a musical drama?<br />But a glance through some of the reviews seems to suggest that these are over worries, at least so from the eyes of the Europeans: most of them seem to enjoy it. <br />The part of Turandot is a difficult enough, perhaps even more impressing would be the singing of the supporting actress, the prince is marvelous too. All in all, suffice to say that in terms of singing, both the solos and the chorus or even the orchestra, they are all superb: they are even better than most of the Metropolitan performances.<br />On the music score, there might be some justification when Mahler slighted Pucinni as a song writer &quot;who just knows some orchestration&quot;. Althugh one might argue that in a way, the two are just 6 and half a dozen. the fact remains, as a whole, Turandot is rather noisy. It seems that the sense of drama in Turandot is not so potent, at least not as popent as Madame Butterfly. And of course, one could always turn to Verdi, like Pucinni himself did, for an alternative. And in any event, credits should be given to the excellent recorded sound and picture of the production.
B000077VPU|1.0|This DVD set is a huge disappointment. How could the DVD have FEWER matertials than the VHS version?! I was expecting to see not just what they have on the VHS, but also the ones they edited out, but no! They have 2 discs and this is all they could put in? I just couldn't believe it! Guess I should buy the VHS tape on eBay instead...
B0000CD5I6|5.0|If you're thinking this is one of those \\"Rudolph\\" or \\"Jingle Bells\\" things, you're going to be disappointed.  This is a GREAT Jethro Tull album.  After you're through clearing the dishes, putting your goofy relatives in their cars, planes, trains etc. and you finally have a moment to yourself, you'll enjoy this. It works any time of year.
B000002UJQ|5.0|Seamless production, insightful, thought provoking lyrics, and impressive technical proficiency blend together to ensure this album as a benchmark in modern pop music.  I simply don't understand the logic behind calling this album &quot;boring&quot; or &quot;drivel;&quot; the music is as dynamic and diverse as possible while maintaining a prodigious sense of continuity that simply bemuses the listener with two confronting paradigms; one of the dispondent nature of modern life, the other of the perpetual hope of humanity for the future.<br />In reality, the album isn't quite as good as all that.  It is still pop music which constricts it's ability to revolutionize music or even change it considerably but it is a solid album completely unprecidented in the last two decades.

Could you please remove the first review as it is now irrelevant. Thank you kindly. Michael Gillis.
B00006CXSS|5.0|Hanks and Spielberg embraced Stephen Ambrose's book,Band of Brothers and is faithful in it's depiction in this epic mini-series. The series is detailed and accurate with more enhancements in direction, sounds, and a haunting musical score.    A first time viewer is shown vets commenting on the occurences in each episode and the identity of these vets are not revealed until the last episode. What amazes viewers will be that the characters in the story are real, which draws them back to view the series again, more drawn to the numerous characters in it.   The story of Easy Company from it's days at Toccoa through Normandy, Holland, Bastone, and in Germany is one of the most complete in scope of the European Theater in World War II.    What makes this series powerful is not just the realism and attention to details but identification with the many characters in the story. Each episode takes the view of one of the characters.    Perhaps the best episode in the set would have to be Bastone which follows medic, Eugene Roe admist the chaos and terror of Easy Company's holding the line at Bastone, earning the 101st's title of the battered bastards of Bastone.    Each disc has information of the actors in each episode as well as information on the characters they portray. Also there are maps, chain of command,and a glossary.   Separate from the main story that makes this set worth having is the interviews with the actual participants of Easy Company. The connection of these men to each other can clearly be seen in their emotion and sharing of their experiences. The viewer gains an appreciation of what these men went through and strengthens the bond for the characters depicted.    Other features of the set includes a making of and a video diary, shamelessly promoting the series. Interesting, but somewhat self serving.   Saving Private Ryan helped to bring the reality of war to movie goers. Fans will know that this is but one episode in the war in Europe. (The story is actually based on events within the 506 PIR).    The fact that the History Channel will be airing these episodes shows the impact of the dipiction of World War II in Europe by the series.   The series is gritty and it will bring forth a diverse variety of emotions for the viewer.    Look for great perfomances of the actors, and an interesting flow of events seen from the view of the characters (different in each episode). The haunting score is non-traditional in the War Movie genre - it blends with the chaos and pathos.    All of the elements of this series make it unique and time well spent as the viewer soon identifies themselves with Easy Company.   What makes this a fantastic story is not only that identification with the varied characters in it, but the story draws them into the action, and the viewer will care about them. It is difficult to imagine another series or movie that will approach the quality and sweeping epic of The Band of Brothers.
B00005JMGC|1.0|Perhaps the one good thing about this movie is the splendid joke of casting Julia Roberts in a film with the title \\"Mona Lisa Smile\\". Whether she uses it to grin or pout, Roberts' wall-to-wall mouth has got to be one of the least subtle and mysterious in all of Hollywood. Jack Nicholson's might run a close second. <BR> Beyond that, there's really very little to recommend this film. The word \\"lackluster\\" isn't quite strong enough to describe what director Mike Newell has put together. There are plenty of movies out there with nothing to say, but this one has achieved a rare, almost perfect hollowness. Roberts plays Katherine Watson, a free-thinking \\"bohemian\\", who comes to the elitist Wellesley College in 1953 to teach Art History. What she finds is a training camp for future Stepford wives, and soon she is on a mission to liberate their minds by getting them to ponder such radical questions as \\"what is art?\\" Mixed in with this, we get several little mini-dramas involving her students and their romantic entanglements, as well as Katherine's ill-considered romance with Bill Dunbar (Dominic West). Dunbar seems to be the only male teacher at Wellesley, and he takes this as a license to use the school as his personal harem. Katherine knows he's a sleazebag, but, being a free spirit with nothing better to do, decides to sleep with him anyway. You go girl. <BR> What is so profoundly annoying about this film is that it pretends to be about non-conformism, a \\"dare to be yourself\\" movie, but it dares absolutely nothing. It's bad enough to subject the world to a watered-down version of \\"Dead Poets Society\\" made with an all-female cast, and it's especially bad to do so without adding a single original idea. But how dare Newell serve up a feast of cliches and try to pass it off as a homage to free thought? The students and their personal dilemmas seem to be pulled right out of the Hollywood-stereotype bag: we have the Overachiever, the Tramp, the Comic Relief, and the Stuck-Up-One-Who-Has-a-Dramatic-Change-of-Heart-and-Becomes-a-Better-Person-In-The-End. We get regrettably tired dialog, and occasional splashes of feminist ideas which, as feminism, might have been daring for the 19th century but not for 1953, and in 2003 they wouldn't even get you in the door of a Judy Chicago retrospective. (It's interesting to note that, in Watson's art history class, the only the works of male artists are shown. It's also interesting to note that the director and screenwriters are all men-- not that it means they've got any bias here, I'm just saying that it's interesting.) <BR> At one point in the film, Watson singles out for criticism a paint-by-numbers kit for van Gogh's \\"Sunflowers\\", lamenting how our society has replaced the passion of art with a regimented, follow-the-rules mentality. This film has more in common with that kit than it would like to admit. At the end, as Watson bids farewell to her class, each student presents her with a version of the van Gogh (each in that student's own style, we're given to believe). \\"How else will you remember us?\\" they ask. Good call, ladies. I was having a hard time remembering you twenty minutes after I left the theater.
B000002UAX|5.0|Since its initial release in 1968, much has been written and discussed on The Beatles self-titled double album commonly known as \\"The White Album\\".<br />A majority of the tracks for this album were written during The Beatles retreat in Rishikesh, India during the Summer of 1968. Upon returning to England to record the album, friction began to emerge within the band resulting in drummer Ringo Starr taking a temporary leave of absence. This was also the beginning of Yoko Ono showing up to the sessions with John Lennon thus creating more tension.<br />Upon listening to the \\"White Album\\", very little of the friction going on within The Beatles is apparent. Indeed, many of the tracks were recorded either completely solo (Paul McCartney's \\"Wild Honey Pie\\", \\"I Will\\" and \\"Mother Nature's Son\\", John Lennon's \\"Julia\\") or one Beatle would be in charge on a particular song using the others as their backing musicians. In spite of this, \\"The White Album\\" still comes off sounding like a genuine group-effort. Like always, John, Paul, George and Ringo combine their effortless talents and hit the nail on the head every time.<br />\\"The White Album\\" is also The Beatles most eclectic album. There is a diverse range of styles heard throughout the 95-minute, 30-song album. From Paul McCartney, there is the Beach Boys-inspired \\"Back In The USSR\\", the pure melodic pop of \\"Martha My Dear\\", the solo acoustic \\"Blackbird\\", the heavy rock of \\"Birthday\\" and \\"Why Don't We Do It In the Road?\\", the lounge-jazz of \\"Honey Pie\\", the joyous reggae of \\"Ob-La-Di, Ob-La-Da\\" and the hell-on-earth terror of \\"Helter Skelter\\".<br /> From John Lennon, there is the rich \\"Dear Prudence\\", \\"Glass Onion\\", the moody \\"Happiness Is A Warm Gun\\" and \\"I'm So Tired\\", the do-wop of \\"Sexy Sadie\\", the laid-back Dylan-esque \\"Cry Baby Cry\\", the lazy blues of \\"Revolution 1\\" and its notorious tape-collage counterpart \\"Revolution 9\\" (the closet thing to pure mayhem that has ever had The Beatles name on it).<br />From George Harrison, there is his greatest composition \\"While My Guitar Gently Weeps\\" which features a wrenching emotion-filled guitar lead from Eric Clapton, the Baroque-inspired \\"Piggies\\", the dreary sinicism of \\"Long Long Long\\" and his ode to sweet chocolates \\"Savoy Truffle\\".<br />Ringo Starr also takes center-stage on \\"The White Album\\" adapting his unique drum style to each of his other bandmates compositions. Besides this, Ringo comes forward as a writer with his Country and Western-tinged \\"Don't Pass Me By\\" and lending his lead vocals to John Lennon's sentimental lullaby \\"Good Night\\" which closes the album.<br />These are just some of the many highlights on The Beatles \\"White Album\\". Indeed, every track (including the nearly unlistenable \\"Revolution 9\\") has important merit in Rock history. Even after its release 35 years ago, \\"The White Album\\" is still one of the finest and most celebrated double albums ever released.

The band's instrumental musicianship comes to the fore not only on the aformentioned &quot;Level Five&quot; but on the rhythmically intense &quot;EleKtrik&quot;, &quot;Dangerous Curves&quot; and the atmospheric soundscapes of the four-part title track which is broken and interspersed throughout the album. &quot;The Power To Believe II&quot; is particularly striking with Adrian Belew and Pat Mastelotto's dual percussion and Robert Fripp's guitar ambience.<br />There is even a tender side to the band which is displayed with the gripping and haunting &quot;Eyes Wide Open&quot;. This track includes some great vocal harmonics and some of Adrian Belew's best lyrics.<br />King Crimson have once again outdone themselves with &quot;The Power To Believe&quot;. This album is the best from this particular line-up of Fripp, Belew, Mastelotto and Gunn. With the departure of Trey Gunn in November 2003, this is sadly also the last studio album by this line-up. However, the good thing about King Crimson has always been their strong musicianship in every line-up that has existed under their name which will probably continue on as long as Robert Fripp says so. This incarnation of King Crimson has definitely walked out on top with &quot;The Power To Believe&quot;. It is definitely worth the listen and the owning.<br />Truly Another Crimson Classic.

B00008H2LB|5.0|It's understandable if you don't like Linkin Park...it really is.  Many find it too mixed between rap, rock, and techno, but it't the perfect fit for me.  I expect that when many bought this, they were looking for a new side of Linkin Park, one that might give them a whole new dimension~well, METEORA doesnt give you that.  It's vertually an extension of HYBRID THEORY, which, along with this, is one of my favorite albums...ever.  Right up there with UNSTABLE by Adema and MORNING VIEW by Incubus.  I LOVE what Linkin Park did with this cd, I really do.  METEORA is awesome and well worth your money.  Should you listen to people who are paid to critique music genres they might not even like, or fans?  BUY IT!!!
B0000DD7NL|1.0|SIMPLY PUT:  RACHELLE FARRELL HAS NOTHING -- AND I MEAN NOTHING! -- TO WORRY ABOUT.<br />WHEN I THINK ABOUT HOW MANY GRAMMY AWARDS THIS WOMAN WON COMPARED TO HOW MANY TRUE ARTISTS LIKE RACHELLE (AND A PRECIOUS FEW SELECT OTHERS) HAVE NOT WON...IT JUST MAKES ME SICK TO MY STOMACH.<br />WILL YOU PEOPLE SNAP OUT OF IT!!  PLEASE, FOR THE SANCTITY OF MUSIC AS WE KNOW IT, SNAP OUT OF WHATEVER TRANCE YOU'RE UNDER THAT KEEPS FORCING YOU TO BLOW THESE &quot;CHILDREN&quot; UP AS IF THEY'RE SOME KIND OF MUSICAL GENIUSES.<br />I DIDN'T EVEN GO SO FAR AS TO BUY THE CD; INSTEAD, I SAMPLED IT ON A LISTENING STATION IN A LOCAL MUSIC STORE AND AS QUICKLY AS I PUT THE HEADPHONES ON, I TOOK THEM OFF AGAIN.<br />I SWEAR I DON'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT MS. KEYS BUT, ADMITTEDLY, I FOOLISHLY FEEL FOR HER 'YOU DON'T KNOW MY NAME' VIDEO, PRIMARILY DUE TO ITS OLD SKOOL FEEL -- NOT HER VOCALS -- THINKING I MIGHT GIVE HER A SHOT TO IMPRESS ME.  WHAT WAS I THINKING??<br />HER VOCAL QUALITY IS SUB-STANDARD AT BEST.  HER TALENT ON THE PIANO IS NOTHING YOU COULDN'T FIND AT ANY GIVEN PERFORMING ARTS HIGH SCHOOL.  ULTIMATELY HER POPULARITY AND APPEAL SEEMS TO FALL BACK ON ONE FACT AND ONE FACT ALONE -- ONCE AGAIN AS IT HAS DONE WITH COUNTLESS OTHERS BEFORE AND ALONGSIDE HER:  SHE MAKES GOOD EYE CANDY.  SIGNED.  SEALED.  DELIVERED.
B0000DJZA5|5.0|This CD is worth the money for &quot;Across the Universe&quot; alone.  Boy do I miss John.  What really struck me about these tracks is the beautiful vocals, which were overshadowed in the original by the heavy orchestration.  Few rock vocalists are as pure as Paul or as expressive as John, and it's a pleasure to hear them so clearly after all these years, sounding new again.
B00005JMFR|2.0|Somehow I feel disappointed with revolutions. Revolutions is a closure of all that began, its an end to the saga this in itself is a disappointment to a fan, but the fact that morpheus and the architects words don't pay off in the final installment doesn't help at all. Neo's abilities in the real world? no clue given to how he was able to do that, we have to believe that he can, as one of the council members put it. I feel that the level of complexity has risen with every film and this has alienated the fans. Revolutions (I think is very complex) has not explained what was promised in the first two movies and yet there are so many unanswered questions It will be difficult for fans to fully comprehend its underlinj=ing messages. Most viewers are more baffled to care about film all together. The film is an intense ride with the high point of the man/machine fight. neo/smith fight was not as good as in the Matrix or reloaded and yet it was bigger, faster and eventful. Drama between major charactors was justified but under used. Sequels is a definate NO maybe in the next 30-40 years later it could be appreciated for its complexity.
B00000K19E|5.0|This is a very, very well put together and interest grabber movie.  I liked this movie not only for the action, but for the plot also.  &quot;What is real&quot; and &quot;Free you mind&quot; are both mind-triping thoughts.  Most defenitlly a movie to buy.
0345451325|5.0|I don't usually like to read.  I was fairly reluctant when I picked this book up.  I had got it just because I liked Halo.  Well, since the first page of reading, I just couldn't put the book down.  I was so into it, reading this became a priority for me.  I LOVED it.  Nylund is an awesome author.  This book is sweet<br />HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!!!!
B00003CXXS|5.0|This movie was made so incredibly well that the dinosaurs looked like that they were not computer animated.  It looked like they were real!  Once the movie pulls you and your interest inside itself, it is impossible for you to pull yourself back out.  To my opinoin, this was one of the best movies I have ever seen, defenitlly a movie you must see and a movie you must buy.
B000089RVR|4.0|OK, so it's no \\"No Angel\\".  I have to say that I fell in love with \\"No Angel\\" because the music was almost haunting.  It was sort of dreamy and made you want to dim down the lights and [make out] with your significant other.  (Or take a bath, or drive in the rain,...)  That and it was just really different from other popular CDs at the time.  This album isn't quite the same but it still has a lot to offer.  My favorites are \\"Life for Rent\\", \\"Don't Leave Home\\", and \\"White Flag\\".  Dido doesn't have a wide vocal range, but even though she's limited I do think she has a very pretty and soothing voice.  What she sings she sings well.  <br />This CD is definitely one to play 10 times before making an opinion.  I will admit that at first I was disappointed.  Every song sounded the same - depressing and bland!  But the more I listened to it the more I heard...<BR>  <BR>There is still some element of No Angel that is missing from this CD, though.  It's hard to pinpoint.  The music and the lyrics aren't as powerful.  The lyrics on No Angel were more empowering/independent and these are more desperate/lonely.  \\"White Flag\\" - I'm in love with you and I always will be, no I won't move on... \\"Life For Rent\\" - another loner song... \\"Don't Leave Home\\" - most men would run like bandits if their girlfriend showed such desparation.  OK, maybe I'm missing something...  but where is a song like \\"Hunter\\"?<br />Overall, I think it's a good CD.  I just don't get the same vibe from it that I got from No Angel. BUT, I will still buy her next CD...
B00005JKC3|1.0|This movie was not good at all.  The way the movie would show three different things happening at one or three different views of one thing happening was very distracting to me.  I did not like the movie at all and I personally think that it was a waste of my time and money to go see it.  Not a good movie to buy.
B0000DD7NL|5.0|I love this album like I love The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill.  Songs in A Minor was a good CD, but I just wasn't feeling it like this one.  Kanye West is a genius, and these two have a chemistry that I haven't seen in a long time.  I love &quot;So Simple&quot;, &quot;Karma&quot;, &quot;If I ain't got you&quot; (one of my favorites), &quot;Slow Down&quot;, and of course &quot;You Don't Know My Name&quot;.  Word has it that Mos Def is gonna do a remix to that song, and if so--I'll be the first in line to cop it.  I love how she incorporates the piano in several of her songs, but it's not overwhelming.  She proves on this CD that she is more than just another singer who can play the piano.  This girl has skills.  I am now a very very BIG A-Keys fan:) <br />NOTE--she even brought Tony, Toni, Tone back on the scene--HOW SICK IS THAT!!!!!?????
B00005JM0B|1.0|This movie was not good at all.  There were too many car chasing parts and the T-X was too powerful.  I was thinking that the t-x could never be destroyed.  Too much action.  This movie could have been a lot better.
B0000DD7NL|5.0|This CD is a spectacular example of the talent pushed to edge. Alicia has done it again and done better. Songs in A Minor and this CD are neck in neck. If you like the first one, get this one, i promise you, you'll like it. <BR> <BR>-A True Alicia Fan
B0000DD7NL|5.0|Okay, I've listened to the CD twice and it's amazing. I think it's better than \\"Songs In A Minor.\\" I liked that one, but this one I love. Great job, Alicia!<br />My favorites in order:<br />Harlem's Nocturne (#1) [Too good for an intro!!!]<BR>If I Ain't Got You (#6)<BR>Samsonite Man (#14)<BR>So Simple (#10)<BR>Karma (#2)<BR>Diary (#7)<BR>When You Really Love Someone (#11)
B0000027RL|1.0|When I bought this album, I thought I was going to get a rip roaring rock album that rivalled Nirvana, AIC and Soundgarden as Seattle`s best Grunge band.  Want I got was a whole lot of filler with 2 killers.<BR> If you want an album that will be great to just sit and listen too, don`t get this.  It bores into your head and relly bugs the hell out of you.  This is not on par with Nevermind and Superunknown.  For Christs sake, even Dust by screaming trees could wipe the floor with this crap.  For all you PJ fans who say they were really successful and the best band ever, better than led zepplin and the beatles and even Nirvana for that matter, stop pulling the wool over your eyes and see them for what they are. crap.
B00005ASOC|5.0|The reviewer a few below me talks about how bad this movie was, but then goes on to trumpet how good Spiderman was.  That alone should be enough not to take his/her review seriously.  They apparently feel a need to brag about knowing an insider, yet give no reason as to why this movie isn't any good other than it's &quot;sloopy&quot; editing.  BTW, Jamal attended a prep school, not a college or university.  Regardless, this is an excellent movie about an unlikely friendship that is very entertaining.
B00000JCOV|5.0|SLipknot, 9 crazy SOBs in mask that creat some of the crazest music around. From the second you start the cd (well except maybe the intro) You'll be blow away by the power and agresiion of slipknot. If you like This you should probably pick up stuff by Mudvayne, Spineshank, or even Mushroomhead.
B000002LK1|5.0|Even though all of the reviews are saying buy it for Enjoy the Silence, really buy it for Blue Dress. It is one the best songs ever. You shouldn't even be reading the reviews for this, just buy it for pete's sake.
B00005N5VO|5.0|THE FRENCH CONNECTION is hands-down my favorite police movie.  Gene Hackman set a standard as Popeye Doyle.  This movie is completely satisfying as a thriller.  Watch it and compare it to any of the Lethal Weapon movies, for example.  The acting in T.F.C. is top-notch, from Hackman as well as Fernando Rey and Roy Scheider.  Direction from William Friedkin is super-tight.  The movie just rocks-- it's cliche to write this now, but the plot just won't let you go.  Friedkin was at the top of his game in the early 1970s, directing this as well as THE EXORCIST.  <br />Fans of police thrillers should see THE FRENCH CONNECTION at once-- it's a memorable movie that you'll enjoy, and you'll watch it every few years from then forward. <br />ken32
B00005JMJ4|5.0|This movie left a mark on my heart. If you are sick of \\"Hollywood\\" movies, then get this movie. Lost in Translation is like art. It moves you in so many ways. It covers every emotion of being a human on the planet. It is the best movie ever made, period.
B00008NRL8|5.0|After hearing nearly every song on Gotan Project's &quot;La Revancha del Tango&quot; on other compilations CDs that I own, I started not to get it.  BUT--being the compulsive CD shopper/collector that I am--I'm down to buying a CD every other day now--I decided, oh, what the hell? Won't be the first time I've bought a CD where I've heard nearly all the songs somewhere else.  TANGO is the order of the day when you pop this baby in...equally relaxing as it is energetic, &quot;La Revancha del Tango&quot; is a great CD full of Parisian/Brazillian flavor sure to impress and entertain all your friends, siblings, parents, neighbors and maybe even the cat!
0385504209|3.0|Maybe it's because I've taken too many lit course, but I had a hard time reading this.  Not because of its complexity, Brown does a good job writing to the average American, but because I felt that much of this book was just a convient vehicle for delivering a history lesson.  The plot itself is fasinating, but you have to wade through historical detail that holds the story down.
B000069AUI|5.0|I bought this CD for nine bucks at Target after hearing Clocks on the radio a couple times, finding it quite addictive.  It's been money well-invested.<br />One thing that needs to be cleared up: These guys are not Radiohead.  I repeat, COLDPLAY IS NOT RADIOHEAD, no matter what the guy who plays Cyclops (in the X-Men trilogy) may say.  Radiohead is also a good band, but really quite different.  Sure, they're both brit bands and they are both moody.  But beyond that, no one should perpetuate this tiresome rubber-stamp categorization, which was unwarranted in the first place.  Frankly, I had thought Coldplay was actually the Dave Matthews Band -- balladish pop crooned by Chris Martin, who happens to sound a bit like Mr. Matthews himself.<br />Next order of business:  There are not many albums I can name that are good through and through, i.e., no skipping of any tracks.  But this album is like that.  There are no weak songs on A Rush of Blood to the Head.  Not one.  It might just be that I happened to scoop up a moody breakup album shortly after ending a two-and-a-half year relationship, but I listened to these songs for about three weeks straight before I finally eased off.  Even now, months later, I sometimes seek out Clocks in my Windows Media Player just because I feel like hearing it.  But let me warn you, from experience, that you will not quickly work your way back to normalcy after your breakup by miring yourself in this album.  The Scientist alone will perhaps even be responsible for reversing whatever progress you made in your difficult (and probably necessary) process of separation.  Anyone who has been stuck on The Cure's Disintegration or Nine Inch Nails' Pretty Hate Machine can attest to one album's ability to keep you from actually moving on with your life.  A Rush of Blood to the Head is kind of like that.<br />If you're a moody sort, you will be drawn to this album.  You may get stuck on it in a big way.  You've been warned.  Five stars and zero equivocations.quivocations.
B0000DD7NL|3.0|This album by far is a ok album, but i think that Alicia has way more star power than this. her last album, that was great. it was full of power and emotion. this one has a few hits like track 2 and 5. the other sound almost the same and its hard to market alicia when her sound is a bit off key to what were used to. i think that this album doesnt showcase her full potential and for that i give 3 stars...i have mixed feelings about it.
B0000TB03W|5.0|Shania is up and on top of the world and her career. She is singing great and this could not be more evident than in this DVD. She is alive and feeling on top of the world and hse ahows this in the DVD by her actions. She is Shania and she is up and on top.
B0000584V3|5.0|Opeth has to be the greatest band in the history of....well...music.Akerfeldt's vocals are amazing...haunting....enchanting.....loud.The crunching guitars dominate all.The acoustic sections are very soothing and mellow.....sometimes haunting.I'll go over the songs quickly.<br />Leper Affinity-10/10<BR>This is one of the best songs on the cd.Full of great Opeth riffery.Lovely piano solo at the end.Very calm and eerie.<br />Bleak-9/10<BR>Kind of has an arabian tocuh to it...but another Opeth masterpiece.<br />Harvest-8.5/10<BR>Really great acoustic song.My favoorite Opeth acoustic.Very relaxing.Akerfeldt's vocals shine on this one.<br />Drapery Falls-9/10<BR>Excellent chorus.Put together very well.<br />Dirge for November-8/10<BR>My least favorite on the cd.Don't know why though.But still another Opeth gem.<br />Funeral Portrait-10/10<BR>My favorite song on the cd.Every time I hear that riff at about 3 minutes into the song,combined with Akerfeldt's voice(which sounds like a demon choking up blood) it sends chills down my spine.Very haunting.Sticks with you.<br />Patterns in the Ivy-8/10<BR>A nice little break after hearing the Funeral Portrait....which leads into the title track.<br />Blackwater Park-9.5/10<BR>Kick-ass.One of their heaviest in my opinion.The 2nd opening riff is so sludgy and hard,it just blows me away.Great song.<br />All in all,this cd is worth 3 times what you pay for it.SO BUY IT!NOW!
B0000TB03W|5.0|This DVD is so much of the talent and desires of Shania. She puts in so much to the music and singing the songs that she has made a DVD that is totally her. She has joined with the fans in a manner that is so her. She almost fell on her head getting down to see the fans. She is not concerned with a fan doing anything. She loves making the fans happy and that is why she has put so much of her into this DVD. Some say it is just Shania and it is and so much more.
B00005JLYW|4.0|Okay okay!  There is no plot really, the characters are pretty stereotypical, and the fights are live action cartoons.  But sue me!  I liked this one as pure gleeful entertainment.  It's an excuse for four ladies to look good - Drew Barrymore, Lucy Liu, Cameron Diaz, and the still buff and babe-worthy Demi Moore.  And do they ever look incredible!<br />The DVD has some extended violence (two minutes added to the fight scenes and that's the UNRATED material!), two commentaries, featurettes, trailers, a video jukebox, onscreen trivia, on-line features, and on and on.  It's loaded!  Picture is good and the sound is rocking!  You could not ask for more from a DVD.  So if you liked the movie at all - it's a bargain!  And it's too funny to hear the WRITERS of the movie (at least 3 of them) discuss how this mish mosh came about.  It's all cotton candy!  If I wanted depth I would not have gotten on this ride of a movie!  But in my book ... chicks who can look good fighting in heels?  Good time!
B0000DD7NL|5.0|When I first heard her first cd, I absolutely loved it!  She has a different tone in her music as opposed to other female artists and that's what I love so much about her music!  However on her sophomore album...IT IS BETTER!  The songs on her new album are more personal, I can actually relate to more songs on this album than the previous one!  I have alot of favorites on her album which are:  &quot;You Don't Know My Name,&quot; &quot;If I Ain't Got You,&quot; but my most favorite would be &quot;Diary&quot;!  I love the interludes she has also!  The cd is yet another classic!  If you do not like this album...YOUR CRAZY!!!  THIS IS WHAT I CALL REAL MUSIC!!!
B0000TB03W|5.0|Two thumbs up for up, shania's new released dvd recorded live in Chicago. You will like it.
B0000DD7LB|5.0|For those of you who gave this album 1 star, you did not buy the album or listen to it...you simply attack her because you do not like her personally.  Keep that in mind, readers.<br />After working on this album for nearly a whole year (January 2003 to October 2003), Britney gives us a very diverse and flavorful album in that ANYONE who listens to it will at least find one amazing song they love.  However, most people already love the whole album because of the fun, glittering beats and undeniably catchy chorus/hooks.  If you need to get a party going or just feel like dancing, &quot;In The Zone&quot; is the perfect choice...there's no question about it.  It's filled with dance, pop, rock, hip-hop, reggae, R&amp;B, and Asian/European influenced beats and each of the mentioned elements of this album are parlayed, or used, to such perfection.  Yes, a very few amount of songs will not exactly be love at first sight, but after repeated listens, they will be perfect.  Each song has a different sound and flavor to it, as Christina Aguilera's &quot;Stripped&quot; does.  Though Britney may not have the powerful voice like Aguilera, it is nowhere near horrible.  A danceable album like this one certainly doesn't require a powerful voice.  Britney's voice is average, and that is fine.  Her previous 3 albums have sold together more than 50 million copies worldwide because the songs were infectious, up-beat, and feel-good pop.  That is the main theme of this album, only chaning the music styles a little bit.  This is the same Britney Spears, only an improvement over her other albums.  There is something on this album to offer everyone.  <br />Also, whoever says she is fading away...how ridiculous.  &quot;In The Zone&quot; debuted at the #1 spot on Billboard, breaking her own previous record for most Billboard #1 album debuts by a female artist.  And first week sales were great: 610,000 copies.  It is a bit of a drop from 2001's &quot;Britney&quot;, which sold 745,000 in the first week.  But think about this...losing only 135,000 copies after a 2-year time period in between albums is incredible compared to the larger portion of artists losing 50% of their total sales due to illegal downloading.  Britney and her music are just as famous as 5 years ago, if not better publicity.  She has that &quot;it&quot; quality that very few stars have.  She will in the business for many years to come, whether you like it or not.<br />I suggest you buy this album and dance the night away.
B0000TB03W|5.0|shania is absolutley amazing in in this new DVD. As seen on NBC her concert in Chicago is a great watch. Shania's star is still shining bright.
B0000CD5I6|5.0|In a word, &quot;YES&quot;! ... I read the initial &quot;hype&quot; where this album was compared with Songs from the Wood and Thick as a Brick, two of my very favorite JTull offerings.  I took this with many grains of salt, but from the very first listen of The Jethro Tull Christmas Album, I am very pleasantly surprised.  It may just be the best Tull album in many years.  It harkens back to the peak era of Tull.  <br />This album is Folk-Rock at it's best with just enough jazz and prog to give it a nice edge.  The original tunes are great, the remakes are very tastefully done and the classical/traditional holiday tunes are masterfully arranged into Ian Anderson creations.  Every song from start to finish is a treat.<br />I'd highly recommend this one to all JT fans and really anyone who likes quality Christmas music with rock leanings.  I love the production on this CD.  The acoustic instruments really ring out but there is also much warmth and feeling ... mandolins, acoustic guitar, flute, piano, sleigh bells, accordion etc. all woven together in a beautiful tapestry.<br />Also, lyrically, Anderson employs his poetry and humor with the same ease he seemed to do it back in the 70's.  This is a very Christmas-Friendly album.  What I mean is, it is not in any way offensive and does not detract from the true meaning of the holiday.  On the contrary, it provokes thoughts of good cheer and goodwill to all people.<br />In conclusion, if you are a Tull fan, do not miss this one.  If you are just a fan of good Christmas music of a more contemporary flavor, this should be a pleasing title to pick up. <br />Highly recommended!!<br />Merry Christmas!<br />- Scriptor
B0000TB03W|5.0|Shania Twain's new DVD, UP! is a goodie.<BR>&quot;two thumbs UP!'
B0000AMRJC|5.0|What is the difference between the extras in the previous edition of scarface (50 min of making of and 17 min of out takes)  and this new one ( rebirth, acting, creating, deleted scenes) ??
B0000TB03W|5.0|Up! Is yet another great piece of work by Shania Twain.
B0000DD7LB|5.0|Have all of her CD's, and think that this one is by far the best!!  Touch of my hand is terrific, as is Everytime.  Give it a chance if you ever liked any of her cds.
B0000TB03W|5.0|Shania Twain's star still shines bright with her new DVD released last month. The concert is basically the one shown on NBC but with a few extras. I enjoyed it and continue to.
B0000DD7NL|5.0|This soulful mixture of old school soul, live instruments and soul stirring vocals have propelled Alicia to the head of her class. The treat recieved in Diary is a throwback to a time of real music, when instrumental music was equally as important as the vocals. Only few artist today achieve this, and Alicia does it with regality. She has exceptional talent!!!
B00003CWPL|5.0|If you're reading this, then you've seen this movie or are at least curious what all the hype is about?<br /><br />The late Stanley Kubrick, the only major filmmaker Lynch has cited as a direct cinematic influence, believed that ERASERHEAD was one of the most perfect \\"cinematic experiences\\" created to date.  This movie has enjoyed success on the midnight movie circuit for years, particularly in NYC where it ran almost every night for something like five years straight. I've seen it on big and little screens in three different states.  Insofar as interpretations are concerned, I've long since tossed all that out the window.  In terms of rational comprehension, ERASERHEAD is the fabled big fish that remains brilliantly elusive of any attempts to capture it.<br /><br />This movie gets better, and more humorous, every time I watch it: in my opinion - ERASERHEAD is the cinematic experience that comes the closest to capturing \\"dream logic\\", next to the equally brilliant WAKING LIFE.  If you ever get the chance, watch ERASERHEAD in a movie theater with a great sound system - you will understand why Stanley Kubrick was moved enough to make his statement.  It's like experiencing someone else's dream - the ultimate act of voyeurism?  As if I was granted audience to a demonstration of delicate brain surgery, and catching glimpses of the patient's face throughout the operation (particularly the opening scene).  It creates such a visceral landscape with its dark, peculiar selections of image and sound, that it seems to be constantly reminding you that the \\"soul\\" is helplessly sloshing around somewhere inside an organic bag of blood, bone, hair follicles, industrial shrapnel, dirt piles and antique radiators; a terrifying and beautiful delineation of a living creature suddenly made aware of its own being (birth imagery abounding).  It is a perfect symphony of sound and image, amazing work for a first time feature film director!  I've seen this movie placed in the HORROR section at local video stores; it's better suited for the COMEDY section, I fear.  The movie was created on the AFI campus in California; production beginning his last year there, and continuing on for several more years in secret.  Not for everyone, but certainly worth a peek.<br /><br />I own a copy of ERASERHEAD on DVD, finally.  Remastered sound and image, includes a few extras - the standout is a \\"stylized\\" interview with Lynch about the making of the film, the characters involved and anecdotes.
0385504209|5.0|WOW, this has to be the best Novel that I have ever picked up. It has a great story yes and it has taken me on a journey through history with an introduction to facts that has challenged a lot of the things that I have been taught growing up. I could not put this book down and eventually when i did put the book down I found myself picking it up again. This novel is more than a suspense thriller, its a history novel told aboard a very intriguing story....its a must read
B00004U8P9|5.0|Often referred to as &quot;Richard O'Brien's little slice of weirdness&quot;, Rocky lives up to it's legend as a cult classic. At fits when you see this movie, you're thinking &quot;Weird, but are lips really THAT weird?&quot; As it goes along, you don't know what you're in for. When Brad and Janet {the hero and heroine} have their car break down, they go to a castle a mile back to use the phone. What they find is a cast of colorful characters, but little do they know that nothing will ever be the same! Featuring oscar winner Susan Sarandon, it's a fun, strange journey. Not for everyone, though. Exclude kids under 15 and religious fanatics from this one!  Still, everyone besides the above exclusions should make a trip to Transylvania to visit Dr. Frank N Furter, Barry Bostwick, and the rocker Meatloaf. Be prepared, when it's all over, you'll be feeling done in, so give yourself over to absolute pleasure and don't judge this book by it's cover {Tim Curry resting on a large pair of lips may already scare you} and see The Rocky Horror Picture Show!
B0000039PW|5.0|Simply one of the best Rap albums ever made. Every song hits perfectly with his incredible lyrical skills. If you are a hip-hop fan, you owe it to yourself to get this album. The review by rap is poor music (just look at his name and itll explain his idiocy) is just moronic. Click his name and look at the reviews this moron has done. Just a lonely loser with no friends.
B00003CXDV|5.0|I saw this film in theaters when it came out 4 years ago and I really didn't care much for it. At the time I was only 15 and did not get most of the numerous jokes sprinkled throughout the film. I watched it again for the second time last night and loved every single minute of it. I never realized just how entertaining and funny this movie was. The entire cast was great, especially Tim Allen and Sam Rockwell(the expendable crew member!). If you haven't seen this film and you love sci-fi or comedy spoofs, check this one out.
B0000DD7LB|5.0|When one hears the name Britney Spears they automatically think lots o' skin, pop star, and teeny-bopper. 'In The Zone' is actually a pretty good album from a person who supposedly can't sing. She lends her Louisianna native voice to 13 great songs that would even make the toughest critic give her credit. I was extremely surprised to hear some pretty unexpected and quite amazing vocal talents that come from \\"a lyp-syncer.\\" She is definetly growing up and her music shows it with more of a mature style for an older audience. DO NOT waste your time reading these 1 star reviews. OVER 50 MILLION albums sold is quite an accomplishment for a 22 year old woman. Yeah she shows too much skin but for any and I mean ANY true music critic and/or fan, this album shows maturity and wonderful pop and sometimes soulful, NOT r/b, music. Here is a fairly descriptive review of this great piece of art.<BR>1. Me Against the Music 5/5 (pop queen and princess unite)<BR>2. Boom Boom 5/5 (GREAT dance song. Ying Yang Twins complete it)<BR>3. Showdown 4/5 (aimed at an ex with a deep groove and message)<BR>4. Breathe on Me 5/5 (my second favorite song. It is compact with deep drums, simple instruments, and a surprising vocal range from Britney)<BR>5. Early Mornin' 3.5/5 (produced by Moby and is an \\"ok\\" song.)<BR>6. Toxic 4.5/5 (it is definetly a fun, upbeat song that'd get anyone on their feet)<BR>7. Outrageous 4/5 (written by R. Kelly and really good. \\"outrageous is repeated too many times, though)<BR>8. Touch of My Hand 4/5 (the most sexual song about making due when a guy is absent.)<BR>9. Hook-up 4/5 (shows signs of a hip-hop style but she keeps to a \\"pop\\" sound. Really good)<BR>10. Shadow 5/5 (I COULD NOT believe the vocal talent she has on this song. The song gets better as it progresses. Stunning)<BR>11. Brave New Girl 5/5 (Reminds me so much of \\"Ray of Light\\" by Madonna. Really, really good.)<BR>12. Everytime 4/5 (the only real ballad on the album, but it shows that despite what other \\"true music fans\\" say, she can sing.)<BR>13. Me Against the Music remix 4/5 (great tribal drums and beats add to the background to make it well deserving of 4 stars.)<BR>Overall.... 57/65 I would give this album 4.75/5 stars but I gave it 5 stars to bring the average cust. rev. up. FYI...just because she is young, beautiful, TALENTED, sexy, and now mature doesn't mean these people have to criticize her music for it. Get over it. Welcome the new Britney. This album is the 1st Britney album that one can actually listen to every song and enjoy them. The most inspiring Britney collection yet.
B0000DD7NL|5.0|This album is sooo hot.  Alicia Keys has outdone herself.  Every song on this album is solid.  She is such an amazing and multitalented musician.  Anyone who had doubts about her ability to follow-up her first slammin' album should be throroughly satisfied with this album.  I bought two...one for the car, and one for home!!
B000099T2L|4.0|My title is true. I was pleasantly surprised by this album. Highlights of this disk include \\"crazy in love\\" \\"naughty girl\\" \\"yes\\" \\"baby boy\\" and \\"daddy\\". Even worthy of a Grammy or two. True R/B........
B0000DZEA1|4.0|Having listened to the previous two Lord of the Rings soundtracks, I entered this third installment with a predetermined expectation of both quality and content, but I was very surprised at the drastically different score found in the Return of the King. The only similarities between the Return of the King soundtrack and the rest of the Lord of the Rings soundtracks lies in the occasional borrowed thematic scores and the title of the album itself. The score in the Fellowship of the Ring really set in stone perfectly the Lord of the Rings universe, so it was to no ones surprise to hear its influence throughout the Two Towers soundtrack, and consequently the Return of the King soundtrack.<br />Like the previous soundtracks, the Return of the King showcases an unprecedented ability to convey mood, feelings, and atmosphere, and this all comes together to produce an emotional response (or several) in the listener. Listening to a Lord of the Rings soundtrack is almost like watching the movie or reading the book itself, the only difference being you don't know exactly what's going on -- you must rely on your imagination to determine that based upon what you hear - and the Return of the King doesn't disappoint. <br />From beginning to end, the Return of the King takes you on an exciting aural ride almost completely seamlessly, which is quite a feat considering the motion picture is 3 hours long versus the soundtrack only being 72 minutes and change in length. Granted, the score isn't present at every moment during the film, but when considering this fact and also the degree of variance in both the intensity and style found in the soundtrack, it is really quite remarkable that it all blends together so well. It comes together so well in fact that it is usually difficult to discern where one track ends and the next begins without paying attention to your stereo's display. There are few tracks that fade to a close, particularly near the end of the soundtrack, where you can clearly tell where the tracks begin and end, but on throughout the majority of the soundtrack this is not the case. <br />To compare the Return of the King soundtrack to any other soundtrack, even of the same genre of music, is simply an unfair comparison. Consequently I must make my final critic based upon the other two soundtracks in the Lord of the Rings trilogy.<br />The Return of the King soundtrack contains 19 tracks and features a vocal ending theme for the credits just like the Fellowship of the Ring and the Two Towers, the only difference being Fellowship only had 18 tracks. <br />The most influential and complex track on the Return of the King soundtrack would have to be the self-titled track: \\"The Return of the King.\\" This track masterfully interweaves so many new and familiar scores together into one package that leaves the listener in awe. It is easily one of the highlights, if not THE highlight of the entire soundtrack. The only other track from the previous albums that I would compare to its level of emotional response would have to be \\"Gollum's Song\\" from the Two Towers.<br />While remarkably well developed, arranged, composed and performed, I would still have to rate the overall aural enjoyment factor of the Return of the King soundtrack lower than the previous two soundtracks. The benchmark set by the Fellowship of the Ring overall is far too high to surpass even for something as good as this. But obviously that isn't a put down on the quality of this soundtrack by any stretch of the imagination - this is a fantastic soundtrack filled with plenty of memorable tracks. Unfortunately though, while the motion pictures have been getting progressively better, the soundtracks have not been able to do the same.
0061015725|2.0|Well, maybe not crap, but its nothing spectacular, either. Once again Michael Crichton brings to life a story that he once could have written so much better. Little tiny robots have been invented, and theyre smart. And they can learn. And adapt. And...do things that youd only expect in a horrible John Saul book. For the last 50 pages I kept expecting the alien's spaceship to come out of the clouds and end it all. Not that this book was about aliens (at all), but it had that crappy sci-fi feel to it.<br />I've no doubt that nanotechnology could become dangerous if used carelessly, but the scenarios Crichton imagines border on the ridiculous. This is the kind of book you buy at an airport, and when youre finished you leave it on the plane so the next person can have it. In some cases people do this to share a good book with a perfect stranger; in this case youre doing it 'cause its just not worth carrying around. 'Prey' will pass the time, no more, no less.

B000053VAF|5.0|Witty, irreverent, beautifully written and directed, &quot;Dogma&quot; is an instant classic! Anyone here giving it a poor review has no sense of humor, and in some cases, a too-large vocabulary coupled with an inability to spell correctly. <br /> I'll admit, the start of the movie is quite abrupt, and I didn't think I'd like it at first, but as it progressed, it quickly won my heart and landed a place amongst the greatest films I have ever seen. <br /> The humor isn't for everyone, and while I wouldn't go so far to say that the movie is anti-Catholic, I can see why this movie might offend those with delicate sensibilities. <br /> All in all, this movie definitely earns 5 out of 5!
B0000DD7LB|4.0|I'll admit, I am a hardcore Britney fan. I love her, and her music.. just like... almost an obsession.. But when she decided to take her hiatus, which really for her, wasn't a break... I was kind of skeptical on how she might be able to return back into the music scene. Sure, Britney gets a lot of publicity - but not for her music. Even though I own all her previous albums, I think they're not really that good. 'Britney' was the best, and that's not saying much. So literally, I counted down the days until 'In The Zone' came out, and I got it the day after. I was totally blown away by this more mature Britney! Her lyrics are better, the music is better, and even though her vocals are computerized on most of the songs, they're not as computerized as much as you think. 'In The Zone' exceeded my expectations, and for the first time in a long time, I am not ashamed to say I'm a hardcore Britney fan!<br />1.Me Against the Music - if you judged how you thought Brit's album would sound by this song as the first single, you really should take more time to hear her album. The other songs are way better than this. Good effort from Brit and Madge tho.<BR>2.(I Got That) Boom Boom - Great song, definitely catchy. It's great that Britney worked with the Ying Yang Twins. Cool 'crunk' (southern-hip-hop) beat!<BR>3.Showdown - I'm still debating on whether I really really like the song, or if it's just ok. The lyrics are really cool though.<BR>4.Breathe On Me - GREAT song. Very sensual. Britney pulls it off well.<BR>5.Early Mornin' - Britney's track with Moby. The song's cool, and Britney convinces you that she's had bad experiences with hangovers, lol.<BR>6.Toxic - I LOVE this song! It's 'intoxicating'. lol. Definitely a good track.<BR>7.Outrageous - Ah, here's the song R. Kelly wrote. Got kind of an Arabic sound/feel to it. The lyrics are a little repetitive, but other than that, it's cool.<BR>8.Touch Of My Hand - This is definitely Britney's most mature track on the album. She talks about 'indulging in herself', and the music just sets everything right. GREAT GREAT song.<BR>9.The Hook Up - I don't really like this song. I tolerate it, and I'll listen to it, but you know. The lyrics aren't that great either. Britney can do way better, and her songwriting on other tracks prove that.<BR>10.Shadow - I didn't like this song at first... I love it now. Britney's lyrical talent really shines on this track.<BR>11.Brave New Girl - Bits and pieces of this song remind me of Madonna's 'Ray Of Light'. The beginning sounds like 'Material Girl.' But hey, more power to Brit for that, right? I like this song, it's a feel good and fun song.<BR>12.Everytime - One word: Haunting. This is definitely one of the best tracks Britney has ever written, ever sung, and one of the the best slow songs she's ever had on an album. Everyone says it's a response to Justin Timberlake's 'Cry Me a River', but I have JT's album, and on his track, 'Never Again', he says &quot;and all you had to do was apologize...&quot; On Britney's track, it says, &quot;and this song is my sorry...&quot; So read into however you like. I love this song.<BR>13.Me Against the Music (Remix) - I like this better than the original 'Me Against the Music.' Not much is different except the music, but I like it!<br />'In The Zone' is Britney's best album yet. She shines on this album, and is more mature and in control of her musical direction than ever. I think she could pick up a new wave of fans, older fans, if they'd just take the time out to listen to her music and what she has to say. As for me, I'm gonna be with her until the end. And with this album, Britney proves that she's not going anywhere anytime soon.<BR>Go out and buy 'In The Zone.' It'll definitely be worth it!
B00000JKH2|5.0|Hello, I will now write a review for the album named \\"Vaya\\" by \\"At The Drive In\\". <BR>Sometimes you might know someone and they will grow their hair out long styled. You will see them everyday, and the fact that they have long hair is what you see them like in your head. All the time when you see them in your head their hair is long. Eventually you don't notice that it is getting longer, or that they have had the split ends trimmed and are now looking quite sharp. Then one day they cut it all off when you are not looking. Now they are all bald or the hair is just very very short, like a military kind of look. Then you see them and they are not like the same person you knew before the great haircut. You still like them, I hope, but the picture in your head has to change to accomodate them and their newer hair. Now imagine that your life is the person with the long hair. If you listen to this album it will cut the long hair off the life you picture in your head. <BR>Thank You!
B00000AFFF|4.0|Hello, I'm here to review to you this album &quot;Painted From Memory&quot;. It is made from Elvis Costello and Burt Bacharach. they are musicians. I liked this album. I don't own it but I have borrowed it from the local library system and listened to it that way. I am trying to buy it but I like to get a bargain always so I'll wait for it to be inexpensive on ebay. The songs on this one are good ones too. Thank You!
0156027321|4.0|Heloo, I'm here now to review to you the book titled &quot;Life of Pi&quot; I read this book when I was painting my mothers house in Oregon America. I thought it was good. It tells a good story. The reason why I only gave it four stars is because of the ending was like the author was giving up a little, which is something common in books, so it's okay. Otherwise it is a good book to read. Also, the book on the back, which you can read here, says it will make me believe in god. I don't understand that, because it is just a book and at the end you don't know if it is true or not. But I guess that is like what happens every time someone thinks they can make you believe in god. Thank you!
B000059MEK|4.0|Discovery as a stand alone work works. It's an electronica pastiche of a whole lot of influences that synthesizes into some heavy break beats and great dance grooves. The first time I listened to it, some of the tracks were lost on me. There were these crazy anime videos that came out with some of the singles, and they matched to the visuals so well that it made me wonder what the rest of the album would look like as music videos.<br />Well, now it makes sense--the album is the soundscape for Interstella 5555 The 5tory of the 5ecret 5tar 5ystem, a collaboration between the goofy Daft Punk kids and anime artist Leiji Matsumodo (Space Pirate Captain Harlock, Spacebattleship Yamato, a whole lot of cool stuff go look him up). There have been music videos, and long form works, but only DJ Q-Berts Wavetwisters has the same kind of visual audacity. Interstella does it one better, though, by creating a film where the music doesn't stop. <br />Some of the tracks that seemed to drag--they make sense once the visuals are in place. Daft Punk crafted the story for the anime work, so I don't doubt that the melodies and strange transgressions are intentional now--especially the copious use of rain sounds and such. <br />If you aren't into spaceage anime, wierd cartoons and dance music, stay away--you'll hate this stuff. If you want to see and hear what the coolest stuff of the 21st century should be all about, check it out. Listen to the album to groove on the sounds--then see the movie and witness a pop allegory about the current state of the music industry. <br />werd.
B0000DD7NL|5.0|I know Songs in A Minor won bookoo awards and all but to me it was well produced crap.  I loved the voice and the talent, that was hidden.  Though it was produced by Clive Davis who I idolize and hope to work with or for one day, it was a misstep.  I got lucky and received a promo of Diary and eagerly listened due to the fact that You Don't Know My Name snatched my attention faster than anything on A Minor did.  I played the intro which was gorgeous (even the name is) and then went to track 2 Karma and was again stunned by the growth in a short amount of time.  I went all the way through without skipping.  I can repeatedly play tracks 4,6,9 and 15.  They are the best.  They have great melodys and track 15 is full on smooth jazz which makes it doubly great in my eyes.  This is a sure thing for a good album and one of the better i've seen this year.  I also got a promo of Kelis's new CD and It too is phenomenal (review coming very soon)
B000094DUP|4.0|Well i thought that this cd was brilliant, just like delta. I loved the songs Innocent eyes, and lost without you... i just wanted to say to  &quot;Lucky im an australian&quot;, that i  am english and i live in america, and yes you are right-americans have no clue who delta goodrem is, but my family and friends in the uk know all about her! She has topped the charts, is on neighbours every day except for saturday and sunday, she has appeared on TOTP many times, and is very popular among many people. Now that she has come out of chemotherapy, i expect they'll see even more of her than usual!
B000002UAX|2.0|There is a great album buried within the White Album.  About 12 songs should have been on this release and the rest relegated to the Anthology series.
B00006JIA4|5.0|It makes me a little mad when people judge Queen by the few songs that are on american radio. I think it's great they've sold so many Greatest Hits albums, but there are so many more great Rock songs from Queen. If you're into a more hard rock/progressive rock/classic rock sound, I recommend you buy the first 3 Queen albums, 'Queen', 'Queen II' &amp; 'Sheer Heart Attack', instead of the 3 Greatest Hits albums as a first album. Queen's early sound shows why so many of the more modern rock bands like Queen (i.e. Metallica, Foo Fighters, etc)
B0000DJZA5|2.0|My two favorite groups, The Beatles and Deep Purple have put out new albums.  One is pretty good and one is excellent. Let It Be... Naked (yes, we are living in a Britney world) is a stripped down version (no strings & no horns) of the original 1970 classic. The songs are also in a new running order and have been digitally remixed to sound...GREEEEEAT! The clarity is breathtaking. It sounds as if the Beatles are playing right in your living room. It is less about Phil Spector and more about moving the Beatles into the 21st century. [...]Naked: 2 1/2 stars  [...]
B00008IAMD|5.0|Johnny Cash doesn't have the greatest voice, technically speaking.  He'll go flat or off-key frequently.  And are there many other artists who would allow that sort of thing to get cut to a master, burned to CD and sold?  The very rawness makes each of these tracks seem live, almost as though he started singing them at the perfect moment when he FELT the songs most, and no matter that it wasn't perfectly sung...it was perfectly emoted.<br />The results are some the most hair-raising songs ever released, in my opinion.  Cash turns each song into one of utter sadness.  This is a man who has felt deep loss, deep disappointment (mostly in himself) and doesn't really expect things to change.<br />What's wild is that many of the covers he does sound like they were songs written for him.  BRIDGE OVER TROUBLED WATER is the blandest of the bunch, but even that sounds new in his voice.  But PERSONAL JESUS!!  Who would have thought he'd cover that song...and yet in his hands, it is transfored.  No longer cold and impersonal, it is a heartfelt, non-cynical song about reaching for the forgiveness of Jesus.  It's a hymn.  And HURT????  Yikes...good luck getting through that one intact.  My skin is prickly just remembering it.  When Trent Reznor sang it, sure it was creepy, but did we REALLY believe this young guy had the life experience to sing &quot;everything I've loved goes away in the end.&quot;  Boy, you better believe Johnny Cash makes that line resonate!!  You don't need to see the video (thankfully included on DVD in this version...don't just buy the DVD single...it's only a few bucks more to add the whole darn album!!) to know this is a classic take.<br />I won't cover every song, but some of my personal favorites include IN MY LIFE (I'm a huge Beatles fan, and it's great to hear this cover...so melancholy) and I HANG MY HEAD, which I swear COULDN'T have been written by Sting.  It sounds like a classic western / folk tale.  Great stuff.<br />The title track, written by Cash, is all the affirmation I need that this guy wasn't just sitting around in the studio waiting for Rich Rubin to hand him a sheet of music. He was actively involved, and could still write a mean tune.  This one is based on the book of Revelations, and it's spritely, mischievous and more than a little scary.  Then man had chops right until the end.<br />The fact that this was Cash's final effort certainly makes the album more poignant, particularly also knowing that his love, June Carter, left this world before him.  I'm sure there will be tributes to Cash for years to come...but none will serve as a better tribute than this haunting masterpiece.  It's not for the faint of heart!
B00008J4P5|1.0|So very not good. So very Bad. If you love rock and really want to hear the next BIG THING, check out the American release of &quot;Razorblade Romance&quot; by HIM. You'll throw this album out, I promise.
B0000DD7NL|5.0|I bought this cd today and was simply blown away.  You can hear soul, jazz, touch of gospel, and r&amp;b all merged together.  Yes, Alicia has staying power.  Her first release was great but this new release definitely shows growth in her ability to express herself vocally and musically. All I can say is  to go out and buy the cd.  Each song will  sound better and better as you continue to listen to them.  There were a few tracks that I was not feeling in the beginning  but after playing  them a few more times everything started to make sense.  There are no weak songs on this cd.  They are all strong.  She will go all the way to the top with this album!!!!!.   Once again I'm astonished with such talent, creativity, and maturity on this new release.
B000000OSE|5.0|This is still one of the best album, much more historicial and interesting then that godawful nirvana's nevermind, november rain is terrific song much better than that lame teenybopping smells like teen spirit, this is the new led zeppelin and truly one of the last great rock bands ever.
B00000E2VC|5.0|This cd is a must have for all Chopin's fans. Michelangeli's rendition of Mazurkas is marvellous. The Ballade op.23 is simply the best ever recorded; i've got also Pollini's and Horowitz's versions... all great but Michelangeli get the absolute perfection. And the same is for the Scherzo op.31 played superbly (another great and similar version is that of Cziffra).<BR>One of the best piano cd you should listen to. Michelangeli is divine!
B000002JSP|4.0|I am sixteen years old at the time this review was written, so I wasn't alive in the three years between Presence and In Through the Out Door (ITTOD). Before the album came out, people figured that Zeppelin had either broken up, or where making their greatest album ever! Unfortuneately, even though they did make an album, it was definately not their greatest album ever. Still people just dismiss it, but it is still really good, just not subliminal. The album is dominated by John Paul Jones. He is credited in all of the songs except \\"Hot Dog\\" and his synth work dominates many of the songs. The first song is \\"In the Evening,\\" their usual hard rock song opener with excellent vocals by Plant (Even though some are hard to understand), great guitars by Page, and nice synth work by Jones; it is one of their best songs ever. \\"Fool in the Rain\\" is a good song, the only problem is that it is so overplayed on radio stations. \\"All Of My Love\\" is a song dominated by Jones' synthesizers, which are very nice and so are Plant's vocals. It was written about the death of Plant's son, not daughter (I don't think he even had a daughter at the time). \\"I'm Gonna Crawl\\" is pretty good too. \\"Hot Dog\\" is awful, their worst song ever. How 'bout using one of the outakes from this album that was put on Coda like, \\"Wearing and Tearing?\\" Even though this is weak for Zeppelin, it is better than most band's pretty good albums. If you take an honest look, this is really a pretty good effort. Too bad that Bonham died shortly after the album was released.

B0000E1WKE|5.0|I bought Whitney Houston's &quot;One Wish&quot; album, and can't stop playing it. &quot;One Wish&quot; has been playing all day in my house. &quot;One Wish&quot; is truly one of the best Christmas album, I've heard in along time.
0553579908|5.0|A Clash of Kings is as good as the first installment of this series.  Continuing in the shifting first-person perspective, the level of detail and care put into these novels does not go to waste.  Slightly longer than it's predecessor, Game of Thrones, and slightly shorter then the third book in the series, A Storm of Swords, this is a book worth reading.  Having read and enjoyed other epic series, like Terry Goodkind's Sword of Truth series, this series is at the top of it's genre.
B0000C6E4D|3.0|I purchase \\"Afterglow\\" and I love the album...My favorite songs are \\"Stupid\\",\\"Time\\",\\"Fallen\\" and \\"Answer\\"...I played the album like a hundred times after listening to Sara.. I put in my Christmas music. I turn on \\"One Wish\\" Whitney Houston Christmas album, and let me tell it definately the best christmas album I've heard in along time..She does a great job. My favorites are \\"Joy To The World\\", \\"Who Would Imagine A King\\", \\"Little Drummer Boy\\", and \\"O Holy Night\\"...I would definately recommend both of these album to anyone who loves good music.
B00005JKC3|2.0|The Hulk can be a complex character, so I'm all for making a movie more about his alter ego, Bruce Banner's dark, twisted soul at the expense of on-screen Hulk time. But, if you're going to take away the action-lime light of the film's star in favor of a &quot;deep&quot; film, it'd be nice if Lee actually developed a plot worthy of being &quot;deep&quot;. This movie did not move me in the slightest. Banner's angst wasn't developed from any source worthy enough to waste 2 hours exploring it. When the Hulk is finally unleashed, unlike every other media incarnation, I didn't feel that pleasure of power, of unleashing one's anger, to take on your bullies. David Banner's green eyes from the hokey television show did more for me in this regard than the movie's CGI monster which, while well done physically, didn't seem to have any personality. The fact that he was mute to the extreme didn't help matters, either. He didn't even growl most of the time. In sum, the movie had a lot of potential, was hyped to make us believe it would live up to said potential, but then fell flat in all aspects. But otherwise it was fine.
B0000E1WKE|5.0|I just purchase Whitney Houston's &quot;One Wish&quot; album after seeing her on Entertainment tonight. I didn't know she had a christmas album out. Anyways I think its a great christmas. I would definately recommend it to anyone who is shopping for good Christmas music. &quot;One Wish&quot; is definately the way to go!
0385504209|2.0|The title of my review says it all.  But for those of you out there who think Dan Brown has uncovered the truth about Christian origins--and there seem to be an astounding number of otherwise sensible, intelligent people who think he's done just that--I'll explain myself.<br />It's not that he doesn't have every right to construct a thriller based on perhaps the most egregiously bogus material ever assembled; one just doesn't expect the author (and his fawning followers) to act as if it's plausible and use it as a stick to beat up on an institution as venerable as the Catholic Church.  Really, his book is in a category with Erich von Daniken and the people who think the Holocaust never occurred. But hey, these are the days of &quot;advocacy scholarship&quot; a la James Carroll, Garry Wills, Elaine Pagels, John Boswell, John Dominic Crossan, and their ilk.  These are also the days, apparently, of open season on the Catholic Church.<br />Which is not to say that, despite its absurd premise so ardently put forward, the book is without merit; hence the additional star.  One must admit that Dan Brown can tell a story; that he writes engaging characters; that his pacing is deft; that his story arc and architecture rock.  Now, if only he could be won over to the side of the angels, but, alas, I fear that is not to be: There's simply too much of the chest-thumping alienated Catholic about his work for that to happen.<br />So, if you must read this nonsense, read it with eyes open, preferably alongside of N. T. Wright's The New Teatament and the People of God, Jesus and the Victory of God, and The Resurrection of the Son of God.
B0000CFW87|3.0|I like the Josh Groban &quot;Closer&quot; album its pretty good. I also purchase Whitney Houston's &quot;One Wish&quot; christmas album along with it. Whitney does a great job on her first ever christmas album. My favorites are &quot;Joy To The World&quot;, &quot;O Holy Night&quot;, &quot;Who Would Imagine A King&quot;, and &quot;Little Drummer Boy&quot; her voice is just amazing and the Christmas album truly does help me get into the Christmas spirit. I would recommend both albums to anyone who loves good music!
B000088E6D|5.0|This album really brings out the best of music. Buble's incogitable voice and riveting lyrics blend incredibly with the astounding music. This type of music is exactly what society needs. It's a vacation from all the &quot;suicidal&quot; rock and gangster rap. Buble is a turn in the right direction.
B0000E1WKE|5.0|Here's my review...<br />1.)

B0000AI44Q|5.0|A Classic! If You loved After The Gold Rush, and Harvest, This album blew me away.I bought a copy for each of my closest friends and family.Listen during your morning drive. I live in Greendale.......come for a visit!
B0000E1WKE|5.0|I like Whitney Houston &quot;One Wish&quot; christmas album. All the Christmas song Whitney Houston sings are classic, but she gave them such life, such meaning...You know you are truly bless if you can sing a song and just touch someone soul. Well, thats what Whitney did to me on this album I love it. I think everyone else will love it to she does a great job on it. Way to go Whitney, I love your Christmas album &quot;One Wish&quot;!
B000092ZYX|4.0|I have to agree with another viewer that compared to OK Computer and Kid A, this album is lacking a little bit.  However, what I like about Radiohead is that they change their sound constantly and are always trying to push the envelope.  <br />Despite what some people might say, this is an excellently produced album.  The vocals stand out and the guitars and all of the synth sounds have distinct clarity all their own.  At first it might sound like a bunch of muck recorded in a basement, but after a while it will grow on you and if you listen to it on a good system you will be able to tell its quality from its depth.  Not as deep as maybe Kid A, but still deep.<br />The main downer of this album are the middle tracks, which I agree, are kind of boring.  The album opens with 3 outstanding tracks, however, and that is why I give it a 4 out of 5.<br />I'm not a collector of Radiohead, but I own Pablo Honey, and I feel that the 4 star average rating is well deserved for this type of album.<br />Also, if you want a more popish sound, try Travis, although their latest album is not their best, either.<br />Sometimes a band just makes a great album that they can't surpass and so then if they quit trying to copy the same sound then they have a chance at making another good album.  It's just a creative regrouping is all.
B00000K3CM|5.0|Too many sequels suffer from Deja Vu. And hardly any of those carbon copies improve upon the original. Home Alone 2 is a carbon copy, but it's also much better and more complex a movie than the first. In another mad rush to the airport the McCallisters make a point of remembering Kevin this time. But he gets lost in a crowd at the airport and follows a man who looks like his dad onto the wrong plane. Thirteen of the McCallisters are going to Miami for Xmas (do they never stay at home?) but Kevin is headed for the Big Apple. And he's going to have that once-in-a-lifetime vacation he's been wishing for.<br /><br />There's much more for Kevin to see and do in New York. He scams his way into the Plaza hotel where a suspicious Concierge (Tim Curry) gives him mighty evil looks at every encounter. He goes to Duncan's Toy Chest, the biggest toy store in town and takes many scenic photographs. Though it is a little worrying now seeing Kevin on the roof of the World Trade Centre.<br /><br />But the Wet Bandits have escaped, and they have just arrived in New York with loftier ambitions and bigger heists to pull off. They even brush by Kevin a few times not knowing he's there. Typically though, once they get a hold of him the give away far too much info. Once Kevin escapes he takes matters into his own hands once more. His Aunt Georgette from the first movie is still in Paris so he uses her half-renovated home as a huge mousetrap for the bungling burglars.<br /><br />The booby traps this time are much more painful and nasty, so it's all the more amusing for us. Who can possibly fail to laugh at Marv getting the shock of his life when he tries to turn on the taps? If the movie were to be released now I doubt if it would be let away with a PG rating. Still, it's nothing for any parents to worry about. Unless you fear your child is going to set your head on fire with a blowtorch.<br /><br />Home Alone 2 has a more satisfying climax than the first. The film doesn't simply end once Harry and Marv are back in the slammer as there is more plot to it than that. Brenda Fricker has a (rather questionable) role as 'The Pigeon Lady' a woman who lives in Central Park and talks to no one-until Kevin reaches out. Plus Eddie Bracken shows up as Mr. Duncan and gives Kevin the best Xmas morning ever as a token of his appreciation.<br /><br />With a bigger story (okay some of it re-used) and more characters and a better playground for Kevin, Home Alone 2 manages to be a superior sequel. While not excessively so. There's loads of fun to be had in Kevin's antics, and Tim Curry is downright brilliant as the mischievous Concierge.<br /><br />It's a great movie on it's own but sadly it will always be called a copycat. Watch it now from a fresh perspective and you might like it more.<br /><br />The 1.85:1 1080p Blu Ray is a huge improvement on the DVD, but fine object detail is still lacking in a few shots. It's a minor quibble though. The strange thing about the DTS HD-MA audio is that, like the DVD, you have to turn it way up in order to get decent sound.<br /><br />Once more the only extras are standard definition trailers for all three movies. Phew! The effort Fox must have put into this Blu Ray (one of the highest grossing movies ever) must have been backbreaking work.lammer as there is more plot to it than that.

B00004U8H4|5.0|When I first saw this in the cinema in April 2000 I hated it. But I watched it with the wrong attitude. I was judging American Psycho as a horror film. Which it certainly is NOT. It's about (as the film constantly says) a complete [loser]. He's no friends. Unable to communicate on any level with anyone of his superficial, yuppie colleagues (some of which don't even know his name), takes far, far too much pride in his appearance and has way, way to much love for his material possessions. He is Patrick Bateman. And fitting in/looking normal/being just like everyone else is the toughest thing in his life. But murder, misogyny, degradation and mutilation is what he secretly longs for. It's really only Huey Lewis and the News that prevents him from doing so.<br />American Psycho is full scenes that are tough to watch. You'll be watching them through the gaps between your fingers. How can you not squirm as Patrick Bateman looks in the mirror smiling, flexing his muscles, while having sex with a call girl? Or taking the whole business card thing WAY too seriously? Other times the film is just laugh out loud hilarious. Bateman tells Willem Dafoe's detective he would love to help him with his case but he has a lunch meeting with Cliff Huxtable. Come on! Cliff Huxtable??? Or how about the scene in the Men's Room when Patrick attempts to strangle the gay guy?<br />Don't watch this as a horror film. It's a comic, drama-tragedy. Patrick Bateman is a disaster waiting to happen. And his inability to stay connected to the world around him is a wicked delight. Though his world of slick, cocaine-snorting, superficial, Wall Street yuppies of 80s credibility is not really the thing anyone would want to be connected to. Maybe he's better off as a psycho with no pals.<br />The DVD has a great looking 2.35:1 anamorphic picture and a loud, well produced Dolby 5.1 soundtrack.

0393307050|1.0|This is a simply terrible abridgement, as are several of the versions read by Robert Hardy.  There are huge gaps in the narrative that would leave one very confused if he or she had not read the book.  I love the book and the entire series, but this abridgement should be discontinued and the book re-recorded.  All of the Tim Pigott-Smith audio versions contain 4 cassettes and are excellent, but they do not include the first volumes in the series.
B0000E1WKE|5.0|Let me start off by saying, nothing is wrong with change. Everyone is commenting on the fact she sounds so different, but her voice is like fine wine. as years go on she is only going to get better, that is strenght you are hearing in voice. Her personal life has nothing do with her talent. we all know she is talented, Whitney Houston is nasty! people can say what they want, there is no one that can come out and say they can sing anything better then whitney. she has made these Christmas Carol's her own. just like everything she has ever sung. when you buy this album, you would see it was worth it. Get it, love it and stop judging people for the inperfection. o holy night is off the hook..Go get &quot;One Wish&quot;, and if you don't have &quot;Just Whitney&quot; grab that too. you will have a Merry Christmas, with Whitney on track.
B000002UAU|5.0|Anything I say about Sgt. Pepper's would be superfluous, so I'll just say that it is a classic slice of 60's psychedelic pop that is an essential part of any rock fan's collection.  Beatles politics aside, the band are as cohesive as ever.  The album runs more as an episodic song cycle than as a concept album.  The only downfall is that Martin's production has aged a little, but as they say, \\"A great song is a great song\\".  Well, a great album is a great album.  I can't recommend it enough.

B0000DYJM6|4.0|I really enjoyed the second disk on this release. From start to finish, it was awesome to hear songs that didn't make the cut to a album and they give good commentary on the inside sleeve as to why. There is a unlisted track at the end of disk 2 also. Not sure what it is but seems rather raw and sad. Pearl Jam always gives back to the fans.

B0000BWVCM|4.0|Movies can do several things for an audience. They can educate, inform and/or entertain. Ironically, perhaps the hardest thing to do is simply to entertain without informing or educating. A movie can educate the audience about a certain subject, and be critically praised, even if it is not very well made. If a movie is designed just to be a `popcorn' film or a blockbuster, then it damn well better know what it is doing. \\"X2\\" was produced, as far as I can tell, only for entertainment, but it does this exceptionally well. Its subject matter is banal because it is, after all, based on a comic book. No matter! It is one of the sleekest, best executed movies of 2003. The CGI effects and set designs are brilliant. The attention to detail is amazing. It is a fairly rare example of a sequel topping the original. I thoroughly enjoyed it.<br />In this episode the mutants find themselves reluctantly in a war with normal human beings over control of the planet. At first, they are not sure of who or what caused this conflict. Even after they find our what caused it, they are not entirely sure of what to do. Their quest to solve the problem makes for a riveting, nail-biting story.<br />Like the original film, one of the movie's assets is its cast, which includes Hugh Jackman, Halle Berry, Ian McKellan, Famke Janssen and Anna Paquin, all of whom reprise their roles. Somewhat like \\"The Lord of the Rings\\" trilogy, there is just enough character definition to let these actors give much more than cardboard performances. Still, it is the awesome scenes and sets that give \\"X2\\" much of its power. <br />\\"X2\\" may not contribute much to the education of the masses, but like an awesome fireworks display, it has a majesty and power all its own.

6305075492|5.0|A young man, Francis, relates to others this bizarre and amazing tale: Francis and his friend, Alan, visit a fair that happens to be in a small German town where some brutal murders have taken place.  Dr. Caligari is the proprietor of an exhibit that features a chronic sleepwalker named Cesare who supposedly can make accurate prognostications. Francis and Alan are amused by this particular spectacle, but when they ask for a demonstration, they are a bit unnerved when Cesare predicts that Alan will be dead by morning.<br />When Alan is, in fact, murdered during the night, Francis suspects that Caligari and Cesare were involved in making Cesare's &quot;prediction&quot; come true, and he goes to the police with his suspicions.  Unfortunately, the police have arrested another man for Alan's murder, and they give Francis the brush-off.  Undeterred, Francis follows Caligari in hopes of obtaining proof of his suspicions.  When they ultimately wind up at an insane asylum, Francis is shocked to learn that Caligari is the director of the institution.  But with the help of Francis, it is soon revealed that Caligari has himself gone mad, and the good Doctor is subsequently hospitalized in his own institution.  Or is he?...<br />THE CABINET OF DR. CALIGARI (1920; 1921 for the U.S. version) is one of the masterpieces of the silent era and, along with Fritz Lang's METROPOLIS (1927), is one of the best examples of German Expressionist cinema.  Though the story is entertaining, the real genius lies not so much in the narrative as in the bizarre and surrealistic mise-en-sc&egrave;ne.  The sets do not reflect nature or reality but are instead highly stylized--using an expressionist form that reflects both cubist and fauvist influence--and are meant to project to the audience the psychological discordance of Caligari and other characters in the film.  And the physical appearance of the characters, especially the principals, are also expressionistic exaggerations, making them more caricatures than characters and serving to heighten the sense of uneasiness and mental disharmony.  So to put it succinctly, the film conveys its underlying theme of ubiquitous psychosis as much through visuals as through narrative--an especially good quality in the era of silent films--and this fact elevates it above mere entertainment to the summit of high art.<br />Any film student, cinema aficionado, or collector of old classics will definitely want to add this movie to their collections. But some contemporary viewers may find it difficult to appreciate THE CABINET OF DR. CALIGARI.  Indeed, in this age of color &quot;talkies,&quot; it is sometimes hard for even ardent film students and aficionados to catch all of the nuances in the narrative and visuals of a silent film, and sometimes two or more viewings may therefore be required.  The wonderful collector's edition DVD from Image Entertainment offers a feature commentary by film historian Mike Budd, and a SECOND viewing with this commentary turned on will certainly help to clarify some of the more subtle aspects of this historical film.

B00008973Q|5.0|As I'm studying for a Ph.D and hoping to specialize in Renaisance English drama, it seemed a good idea to see this film, Kirosawa's adaptation of Shakespeare's King Lear to feudal Japan.  And I am very glad I did!<br />Kirosawa's tale may actually improve upon some of the things Shakespeare did in some cases.  We're given a good view of what &quot;Lear&quot; was like in his youth through ruins and the fact that his two older sons are both married to women who's families he conquered and slaughtered.  The Fool, a mainstay of the Shakespearean tale, is given a scene that shows the pathos of the man.  Lamenting that he's spent his whole life being nurse/entertainer to Lord Hidetora, the audience can see why he'd want to pack up and run away.  And yet he stays (more than you can say for Shakespeare's Fool, who just disappears at one point and is never seen again).  Kirosawa also answers the question of what happened to Lear's knights for his film.  Hidetora's retainers still follow him, they don't just disappear, and it's their fate the fact it is caused by Hidetora's two older sons, Jiro and Toru, that ultimately drive him to extreme madness.<br />What Kirosawa adds also makes for a much nastier ending.  Lady Kaede outscores all the Bard of Avon's shrews and masculine women as a manipulative demon.  Without her influence, perhaps her husband Toru wouldn't have decided to humiliate his father, and most certainly younger brother Jiro wouldn't have goen to war.  That she's punished for her actions is a certainty...that she was still successful adds an awful dimension to the film.  Compared to her opposite number, the dutiful Buddhist Lady Sue, we can see the world of Ran is one that rewards treachery and force, while the quiet contemplative life won't get you anywhere.  Hidetora's end was caused by his actions in life, and just as he's starting to finally come to terms with the man he was, the culture he lives in, and the events around him, it is far too late and all we're left with is a blind man almost stumbling off a castle wall.
B00005N7Z1|4.0|After a Detroit police officer (Peter Weller) is sadistically murdered by a group of thugs sometime in the near future, he is resurrected--well, sort of--when his head and brain are used as the CPU of the latest law-enforcement experiment: RoboCop, a high-tech cyborg police officer designed to be impervious to corruption and nearly indestructible.  RoboCop is a very effective law-enforcement tool, but when the thugs that killed him try to thwart the cybernetically revived policeman, their efforts backfire as they inadvertently unlock his repressed humanity and thereby make him an even better cop.  Thus goes the basic plot of 1987's ROBOCOP.<br />Though many filmgoers don't seem to &quot;get it,&quot; ROBOCOP is more than an action or sci-fi flick; it is actually a dark comedy.  Or rather, a darkly humorous satire.  Director Paul Verhoeven and writers Michael Miner and Edward Neumeier take pokes at several American institutions and subcultures, not the least of which are law enforcement, corporate politics, goverment, and mass media. In addition, they satirize a popular science-fiction and comic-book vision of the future, one in which society at large decays to near anarchy while science and private business still manage to crank out high-tech toys.  It could even be argued that, on a broader level, ROBOCOP is a parody of the popular 1970s TV show THE SIX MILLION DOLLAR MAN, with RoboCop as a dime-store reflection of the cyborg Steve Austin and corporate lackeys and degenerate street thugs filling in for the various threats to the American way of life.<br />The special FX in ROBOCOP are pretty cool, especially for their time, and the acting is just fantastic.  Die-hard genre fans will no doubt recognize star Peter Weller from 1984's THE ADVENTURES OF BUCKAROO BANZAI ACROSS THE 8th DIMENSION, as well as numerous other sci-fi and horror flicks.  In his performance as the titular character in ROBOCOP, he does a perfect job running the gamut of human emotions as he goes from man to robot to a cyborg who regains his humanity.  The adorable Nancy Allen is very effective as RoboCop's human partner, as she emotes genuine concern when she recognizes the human portion of RoboCop and subsequently helps him to get in touch with his humanity.  Genre fans may recognize her from her supporting role in Brian De Palma's CARRIE (1976) and co-starring roles in 1981's BLOW OUT and 1983's STRANGE INVADERS.  Other good supporting performances are delivered by veteran actors Ronny Cox (1972's DELIVERANCE and 1990's TOTAL RECALL), Kurtwood Smith (Red Forman on TV's THAT '70s SHOW), Miguel Ferrer (the 1994 TV mini-series THE STAND), and Ray Wise (1982's SWAMP THING and TV's TWIN PEAKS).<br />As one would expect from a movie depicting a grim future, ROBOCOP is very violent and there are some pretty gruesome scenes.  Fans of sci-fi action flicks or slasher films will probably not get put off the gruesome killing of Officer Murphy (who becomes RoboCop), and they may actually enjoy the scene where a thug starts melting after getting dowsed with toxic waste.  But the average viewing audience may want to consider the high level of graphic violence when deciding whether or not to view or purchase this film.<br />The no-frills DVD from MGM offers a nice widescreen transfer of the film but no extras.  Still, it's cheap enough that frugal sci-fi fans should grab it up for their collections.  The Criterion Collection DVD offers lots of extras--including a feature commentary from the director and other crew members, trailers and TV spots, and more--but its steep price may deter all but die-hard ROBOCOP fans.from man to robot to a cyborg who regains his humanity.

B00004SAJK|4.0|Even without Michael Schenker, MECHANIX is one of the best UFO albums ever, at least it´s one of their most focused efforts. Even the two ballads, &quot;Terri&quot; and &quot;Back Into My Life&quot;, are very well executed and pleasant. There´s also a cover song, &quot;Something Else&quot;, that sounds good, it´s pure rock and roll.<br />Ther rest of the songs have a special hard punch, with all the members delivering the goods. Phil Mogg´s voice is absolutely crystal clear and strong here. As for Paul Chapman, of course he could not compete with Michael Schenker´s virtuosity, but the good thing was: he did not even try! Instead of trying to emulate the master, Chapman instilled the songs with his particular signature and style, and the result was very satisfatory, displaying well constructed and melodic solos.<br />MECHANIX is one of those lost gems that sometimes we find around. A GREAT album!
B00005JM02|5.0|This is one of my favorite movies! I have seen it at least 10 times. And twice in the theater. It is very easy to love the characters like Dory, the blue fish with a short-term memory and cute personality. Definitely Pixar's best!
6305291446|3.0|I'm sort of &quot;blah&quot; about this film. I don't hate it, but I don't particularly like it. I suppose it's alright, but it's definitely a Scream ripoff and designed to appeal to the mainstream. Jamie Lee Curtis returns, which is a highlight, though the absence of the late Donald Pleasance as Dr. Loomis is greatly felt.
B00009V7T2|5.0|*#2 on Top Albums in 2003* <br />The Mars Volta. The name already implies something fresh and unique, something the rock scene needs REALLY badly nowadays. After hearing a couple tracks I decided to pick up &quot;De-Loused In The Comatorium&quot; and the result was pure euphoria! The artwork is abstract (and kind of wierd!) with sayings like &quot;when will you come convulsing to my basement&quot; to set an eerie tone. <br />The album is based on the life, times, and suicide of Julio Venegas, and so right from the start there is this building sense of paranoia, caused by Cedric's high-pitched yelling and the schizophrenic guitar playing by Omar Rodriguez. The opening track is a short track that builds to the catchy number 'Inertiatic ESP', released as a single in Europe (and NA I believe). This song focuses on a main guitar riff and a heavy chorus which sounds like the emo days of At The Drive In (the band from which the broke up). The feeling you get from the next track though, is that they've slipped some prog, 70s rock, and even a bit of jazz/fusion into the mix! 'Roulette Dares' has interesting dynamic contrasts, amazing drumming by ace Jon Theodore, and superb work by the famed Red Hot Chilli Peppers bassist Flea, who contributes as the studio bassist. 'Tira Me A Las Aranas' is a short guitar interlude that leads to 'Drunkship of Lanterns', laden with cool percussion beats, and off-key guitar playing with centering on a main bass rhythm. 'Eriatarka' is probably one of my favourites: Soft choruses with BEAUTIFUL basslines by Flea, and the crooning by Cedric turns into an assault during the choruses. This could do well on the radio! 'Cicatriz ESP' is the epic on the album. Just over 12 minutes, this is a thrill ride with catchy choruses, a couple of huge jams a la Zeppelin (with great work by keyboardist Ikey Isaiah Owens who is too far in the background on most of the <BR>album) and an interlude with guitar effects. 'This Apparatus Must Be Unearthed' is a shorter, energetic piece that precedes the monster ballad 'Televators'. Using string bass, a bongo beat, sensitive guitars, and amazing mellow vocals, this is the centrepiece of the album. The final track though, is one of the best closers I've heard: 'Take The Veil Cerpin Taxt'. It features three minutes of catchy mayhem, leading to quiet instrumental interludes, a bass solo (!) and then a guitar solo, before a furious ending!<br />This has to be one of the most unique efforts of the year and The Mars Volta deserves to be praised for this massively successful effort! All musicians were at their utmost creativity and talent, and this took a lot of vision to create!<br />***** (5 stars)
6305971099|1.0|I can't be bothered to write out a full review for this. I can't summarize the plot, because there really isn't much of one. Michael wakes up a year after the events of Halloween 4 and begins stalking his niece, Jamie, again. That's it.<br />A mind-bogglingly pointless film, even Donald Pleasance (who doesn't look at all happy to be there) couldn't save this trash.
B00005AQGH|5.0|Okay Buddy, You're from Montgomery Alabama! I'm surprised you even know how to spell, let alone speak &quot;correctly&quot;.  Who gives a crap how someone talks, why don't you go out and get a job?  I hope that someday you have to live in another country where they speak another language, so they can all tell you that YOU are an idiot and why don't you learn the language. Have you ever heard of racism?  Because you are obviously a racist, if you can't get past the fact that your fellow Americans might have their own dialect.  The problem with you is that you can't see blacks as anything else but &quot;them&quot;, when in reality, they are Americans just like you.  How can America be the best country in the world if they still oppress people because of their race?  I love Tupac, and even though i can't understand every word, i'm willing and able to learn what they mean.  And just because rappers lyrics don't talk about &quot;crying in their beer&quot; does not mean that they don't have talent.  I'm down with tha Gs, and i'm proud to know it, fo' sho!  <BR>                         Love from Someone stronger than you
0385504209|5.0|Having just finished Dan Brown's masterful religious puzzler DA VINCI CODE and John Mannock's heartwrenching WWII U-boat tale IRON COFFIN, I feel I've gotten a year's worth of top-quality fiction in less than three weeks!  DA VINCI is a tremendous detail mystery--a twisting, turning, maze of a book that provokes serious thought about the foundations of Christianity and the dirty little secrets the established Church keeps.  I won't give it away, but buy Dan Brown's latest--it'll keep you up all night finishing it!
0151008116|5.0|Life of Pi is truly a unique story. It is the story of an Indian boy who is the child of a zookeeper. When his parents make the decision to leave their country for Canada, Pi's life is on the verge of changing forever. Through a series of events, Pi ends up in a lifeboat with a Bengal tiger for several months. The book is primarily written in Pi's voice, although it is framed by the situation of Martel interviewing an extraordinary man.<br />Not only is this book extremely well-written, it is purely unique in its plot and characters. The book is masterfully constructed, especially when one considers that most of the book takes place with only one human character in the middle of the ocean.<br />Passages where Martel delves into discussing animals are most enjoyable and palpable. There are countless memorable scenes and characters, ones that will stay with me forever. The descriptions are so vivid, you can almost sense what the characters sense. For being extraordinary, the plot is believable - I wouldn't even categorize it as magical realism (not that magical realism isn't believable, it is just fantastical at times). Besides introducing you to a multitude of experiences and characters, Martel also runs the reader through the entire gamut of emotions, everything from hilarity to despair to religious ecstasy to love.<br />It is admirable that Martel resisted the trap of anthropomorphizing the animal characters. Instead, they stayed beautiful, real, and fascinating.<br />Definitely pick this book up and experience Pi's India, ocean, and survival!
0312319517|1.0|I've been a huge fan of Forsyth since reading The Dogs of War. I've always loved his work.<br />But now this.<br />This book is filled with a amateurish writing style, barely-plausible plot points, and various inaccuracies which make me wonder if the author actually researched the subject matter. The story isn't even that interesting, but this is probably due to the lack of believability.<br />The short, choppy writing style makes this difficult to read, exacerbated by the story line suddenly going back in time to explain something or other. And just as suddenly you're back in the present, and worse for the wear since the transitions simply aren't done well. They're more like afterthoughts.<br />It would not surprise me to learn that Foryth did not write this. The writing style isn't like his books of old, the plot is far below par, and it is just not very good at all.
B0000DD7LB|3.0|Not too bad for Brit's 4th album.  The disc has caught the attention of my ever lovin' musical ear.  &quot;Me Against the Music&quot; isn't all that bad, &quot;Showdown&quot; is awesome, &quot;Toxic&quot; is great, &quot;Touch of My Hand&quot; is another good hit.  These are my favorites.  All in all, the album isn't Brit's best, but these tracks that I've listed are VERY dance and club worthy (except for Touch of My Hand, but who knows)!!!
B0000CC5CS|4.0|Before I give my opinion, let me state something about Full Screen version of the DVD.  I own both the FS and WS and found that they are not the same.  The FS version has an extra sceen of the T-X as she wall nake across the street.  The sceen provides an above the waist nude shot that is not present in the WS.  I felt parents(as myself) would find this interesting as the WS version has no fontal nudity.  I returned my FS version because of this nude sceen.<br />Ok, as for the T3 DVD, I feel some of the reviews may be a bit too harsh on the this movie.  T1 was a good movie(not great).  The story line was good, but the special effects were weak.   However, the Terminator series became a house hold conversation when T2 hit the screen.  It was not the great acting or the great story line that made T2 a must see, but the special effects.  T2 had a unique enemy which left the viewer guessing about it's possible defeat.<br />It was T2 that created the excitement for the series(not T1) and the hope for a 3rd movie.  However T2 was so unique that it left little room to improve.  The writers knew this and hence the T-X is different and only slightly improved over the T2 terminator.  However, while the writers recognized the lack of head room for improvement, the audience does not and hence this opens the door for the disappointment.<br />Audience expectation is not a good measure for a movie review, rather the movie should be jugded on its own merits.  T3 has all the same elements as T2 with enhancements.  Same special effects, same action/fight sceens, same cheesy lines.  If we were reviewing T3 as a sequal to T1, we would be applauding it as a hugh improvement.  However we are comparing it to T2 and it stuggles to be as good and hence dissappoints.<br />Personally, I never watched the T series until recently(just before T3 was released).  From that persective, I must say that T3 is significanly more enjoyable to watch than T1 and is &quot;almost&quot; equal to T2.  But more importantly, I just don't see how you could close the door on this series at T2.  T3 does an excellent job of finding a way to close the series.  Hence, IMO, is a must rent and buy(if you own T1/T2).
B0000DD7NL|1.0|FIVE STARS, NOT!!!  I'm totally disappointed with the latest work of Alicia Keys.  I must AGREE with spoiled from Detroit...I waited in anticipation for this CD.  So, when, \\"You Don't Know My Name\\" dropped, I was like...I gotta get this CD.  An associate and I ran out on the very first day it was released and we each purchased this CD.  After listening to it for a couple of days, we asked each other what we thought of our recent purchase...and we responded almost in unison...I'm not feeling it.  <br />If this was a first run movie, I would say wait for the video, or better yet, wait for it to premiere on network television.
0790731940|4.0|PICTURE QUALITY = 4-SOUND QUALITY = 5+The overall picture quality is pleasant and satisfying. Color is nice but pxilazation is very present in the begining of movie. Improves as movie goes on. This being a very senic movie I was not completly happy but still satisfied. Could've been a bit sharper and remastered from high definition but wasnt.The sound quality in Dolby was awesome. Not in Dolby Digital but on a system with Pro Logic II it souded great if not better than most non-digital dolby surround. All surround sounds are present and really stood out. The soundtrack is placed perfectly and surrounds the room. Very happpy with this DVD sound quality.THE MOVIE - *note spolier. The movie was excellent in all entertainment areas if your looking for a FUN Western movie. Comedy, action, stunts, scenery, and many great actors. Everything you would want in a &quot;fun&quot; western film in the old fashioned tradition. Light on violence and good enough for the whole family.*Spoiler - The best (and my favorite) thing about this movie is the fact that James Garner still plays as Maverick even though the audience doesn't know it. Watching it over and knowing that Mel Gibson is playing his role as &quot;the son of Maverick&quot; and James Garner is still the orginal character he played in the past makes this a great movie to watch over and over.My overall review is that it is worth buying and I'd give it 5 stars if the picture was just a touch better. Don't be fooled though, I have a large projection widescreen tv with a progressive component DVD player so I see almost any grain there is if any is present. Overall this DVD was satisfying enough to make me happy I bought it. On any other tv it will display a perfect picture. Sound quality is great on a home theatre sound system.This is a movie that should be made on a Superbit DVD.
B0000B3FCX|5.0|If you listen to the 30 seconds of the first 5 songs a couple of them I think you'd really like this album. There's some harder songs like Flat on the Floor and some slower ones like Someday, Feelin' Way Too Damn Good but they aren't TOO soft like Norah Jones or anything...If you liked Silver Side Up this would be a good buy
B000058983|5.0|Warning, get two of these cds to last your lifetime!!!!    This will be in repeat mode often!!!!!! Not being totally crazy over most 60's music except for the Beatles, Kinks, Hendrix, Doors,some Beach Boys, and a few others, this 1967 album by Aurther Lee and Love is 1967 in all it\\"s psychedelic glory with acoustic, horns, etc, but this is not your typical 60's psychedelic album, the songs are wonderfully written and catchy in a progressive sort of way, not poppy. Forever Changes is a complete out and out masterpiece that can not be touched.  A Lee and Love constructed these tunes while being in California and things going on.  Some of the lyrics make you think about the themes and reveal times of the 60's and what he was writing about and are fabulous.  I will not go into the songs but check out Alone Again Or, And More Again, Maybe the People, Live and let live, The good Humor, and the one and only You Set The Score. I feel that this album by Love may have started the progressive rock movement in some way because this has not been attempted before with the mix of instruments and production. It is about life, love, emotions, and the music is put together and produced in a way that I feel has not been recreated since as well as not sounding dated like some 60's music seems to sound.  So, if u heard about it and thought it was a one time listen 60's psychedelic thing, think no more and get the new wonderful remastered version, just beautiful, try some Love.  Please start your Love collection with Forever Changes cause being a masterpiece, the other albums of Love are good but no where near the bombastic and timeless Forever Changes, nothing changes in this milestone in rock!!!!
B000002MY3|4.0|From the first track onward, Jagged Little Pill is in the face of all it's listeners.  Alanis Morissette has a voice that could take all the pain in the world and in one voice lift it up to heaven.  okay, so maybe thats a bit meldramatic, yet something about it is true.  Morissette combines alternative ripping chords and haunting vocals to produce a sound like no other. <br />The first track, &quot;All I Really Want&quot;, is a seeming release of the frustrations that come along with relationships.  Morissette sings &quot;What i wouldn't give to find a soul mate / someone else to catch this drift&quot; The harmonica mixed with Morissette's vocals immediatley makes the listener pay attention to what she has to say.  This song is followed by another angst driven song about a failed relationship.  In &quot;you Oughta know&quot;, Morissette wants to drive into the head of her ex-lover allt he things that he told her and didn't live up to.  Her vocals start off quiet and soft, while the music is only a bass guitar.  By the end she is angry and seems to growl the lyrics. <br />The CD slows down a bit with Perfect.  This song is something that everyone can relate to. It describes how it feels to have parents who push you and make you do things over and over again until you do it perfectly.  It's written as a child might percieve what his parents are telling him.  The music swells as Alanis reaches a breaking point and lets go.  Morissette doesn't ever say whether or not this happened to her, but her emotions are so real that it's believable. <br />The last few songs onthe CD are the best.  &quot;Ironic&quot; and &quot;You Learn&quot; were two of her biggest hits and are still played on somewhat heavy rotation.  But it's the song &quot;Mary Jane&quot; that shows Morissette's true vocal talent.  It is a haunting ballad that makes listeners wake up and realize that she can actually sing.  People who only hear the singles may think her composition syle only includes screamingvocals and loud angry guitar riffs, but &quot;Mary jane&quot; and &quot;Your House&quot; make youforget about he music.  It's all her voice, and it's beautiful. <br />All in all Jagged Little Pill is Morissette's best accomplishment to date.  She had fans all over the world and is one of the most well know female vocal talents.  In 15 months Pill sold 12 million records, coming in at fourth place on the highest selling debut albums.  Morissette isn't one to be overlooked, but if you have, it's definitely worth another listen.
B0000DZEA1|4.0|After hearing the soundtracks for the first two movies I was really looking forward to this release.  Sadly, I am a little disapointed.  Don't get me wrong, it's still good, but the first two were better.  It is a definite must-have for any fan of Lord of the Rings.  The music has a slower pace to it compared to the first two CD's.  Not what you would expect after hearing the music for the Two Towers.  Basically, this soundtrack is a rather anti-climatic ending to the best trilogy ever to hit the big screen.
B00012FXAE|3.0|Producers of this disc set claim there was not enough disc space to include the DTS track due to the 154 min. special edition run time.  I find this extremely hard to believe.  The Terminator 2 Ulimate Edition DVD is two minutes longer than Aliens SE and that disc has seamless branching, an audio commentary, Dolby Digital EX, DTS ES, and the picture was superb.  Bunch of BS if you asked me.  The lack of a DTS track on this release is a major goof and, as such, just dropped the title from my reference list.<br />Blunders like this are nothing new to 20th Century Fox.  Keep in mind, they are the same bunch of bozos that gave us the non-anamorphic special edition DVD of The Abyss.<br />Get a clue Fox!
B000000W5L|5.0|Most people would consider &quot;Let It Bleed&quot; to be The Stones' best album. I disagree; &quot;Bleed&quot; is merely &quot;Exile&quot;'s younger brother. Both records are Keith Richards tour-de-forces (before the drugs got too bad: &quot;Goats Head Soup&quot;, for example) yet &quot;Exile On Main Street&quot; is without doubt the best tribute The Rolling Stones ever made to the music that influenced them most. To me, it goes hand in hand with &quot;The Basement Tapes&quot;, the infamous collection of traditional and half-improvised originals Bob Dylan and The Band recorded in 1967 (released in 1975.) If &quot;The Basement Tapes&quot; are Dylan's homage to tradtional American music, &quot;Exile&quot; is the Stones. It was even recorded in Keith Richards' basement in France, with all the cluttered, cardboard-boxness basement recordings can have. For a change, Jagger takes a backseat to the rest of the band; Keith gets his open-G moments of glory with &quot;Tumbling Dice&quot;, &quot;Rip This Joint&quot; and &quot;Happy&quot;, while Mick Taylor's lead guitar has none of the showboating tendencies he showed on later records (Bill Wyman, as usual, plays bass on half the album, the rest of the bass playing split evenly between Taylor, Richards and upright bassist Bill Plummer.) The lead track, &quot;Rocks Off,&quot; is probably not only The Stones' best opener but the best example of their full 8-piece combo (the five Stones augmented by Bobby Keys' and Jim Price's horns and the typically excellent piano playing by Nicky Hopkins.)  There is the &quot;acoustic side&quot;,  which has clear country influences (no doubt courtesy of Keith's friend Gram Parsons), notably &quot;Torn And Frayed,&quot; an allegory foreshadowing Keith's eventual decline. There are some throwaways, of course: the covers of Slim Harpo's &quot;Hip Shake&quot; and Robert Johnson's &quot;Stop Breaking Down&quot; pale in comparison to the Stones' earlier blues covers, but, for what was originally adouble album, &quot;Exile&quot; doesn't really had a bad song to speak of; it has none of the tediousness of most doubles (&quot;The Beatles (White Album)&quot;, &quot;Physical Graffiti&quot;) and is probably the last Stones album where they still had a few original ideas left- it was all downhill from here.
B0000VCZK2|2.0|Buyer beware, no DTS audio on Aliens and Alien 3.
0679879269|4.0|I found the book The Amber Spyglass, by Philip Pullman to be really exciting. It is a mixture of fantasy and adventure. The reason why I chose this book is because I enjoy fantasy because it can take you to places that you have never even dreamed of. One of my favorite quotes is \\"because he is Will\\" on pg. 82, because it shows the trust Lyra has in Will and she knew that he was going to save her. Together they can accomplish anything. It shows they make a really great team despite the people who are after them, and the question about the thesis of what dust really is. <br /> One of the themes in this book is never give up and you can go far with teamwork. I definitely agree with the theme. I think those are some really good pointers for dealing with life that was put in the book by Philip Pullman. I believe that those are good points to go by in real life. I try to go by them. To me a little team work can go a long way. <br /> In conclusion, I would recommend this book to anyone who likes to read fantasy. It really is a book that will take you on a magical ride.  I would recommend this book because I think Philip Pullman wrote this book, he really let his imagination go wild. It really captured my mind and made me so I could not stop reading the book.  It is a book that is great to read and it is something I am sure you would enjoy.
B0000VCZK2|2.0|I have to agree with many of the other reviewers, only Alien and Aliens are worth watching.  After the first 10 minutes of Alien 3 the entire Alien series was summarily flushed down the toilet.  It was quite possibly the worst sequel ever made, that is until Resurrection was released.  <br />Most likely this is why Fox didn't release the single movie editions at the same time as the \\"Quadrilogy\\", hoping people will fork over the big bucks just to get the first two films.  They've also tried to attract the fence sitters by including a 9th disc only available in this set.  <br />Well, I'm not biting.<br />According to some on-line reviewers, this set took a year to produce and is claimed to be the ultimate.  Nevertheless, it didn't take me 10 minutes to discover a major flaw in the set.  Only Alien and Resurrection have DTS audio tracks.  Apparently, the Producers claim there was not enough disc space to include the DTS track on Aliens and Alien 3 due to the longer run time.  I find this extremely hard to believe.  The Terminator 2 Ulimate Edition DVD is two minutes longer than Aliens SE and that disc has seamless branching, an audio commentary, Dolby Digital EX, DTS ES, and the picture was superb.  Bunch of BS if you asked me.  The lack of a DTS track on Aliens is a major goof and, as such, just dropped the title from my reference list.<br />Also, the art and mile long foldout packaging is beyond comprehension.<br />These blunders are nothing new from Fox.  Keep in mind, they are the same bunch of bozos that gave us the non-anamorphic special edition DVD of The Abyss.  Get a clue Fox!
0553296981|5.0|I enjoyed reading what happened to the Jewish girl with the nice family in a crazy world.  I also enjoyed MY LAST REMAINS by Jill, which was like a \\"twisted anne frank\\".  Jill is a jewish girl whos family escaped the Nazi's, only to become like the Nazi's themself.  Anne Frank's family did not make it to the US.  Jill's family did, and the world Jill was forced to live in was just as crazy and in someway more so.  Jill writes her autobiography using her first name only.  She never wanted to be a writer.  Anne wanted to grow up to be a writer.  The books have similarities and have some ironic differences.  I highly recommend both.
B0000VCZK2|5.0|Fox has outdid themselves with this box set possibly creating the best set to date. I have been waiting for the extended version of alien for a very long time and also for an extended version of alien 3 the other two I don't really care about. I think this is what to expect the star wars trilogy to be like, If not a better box set, although it will be hard to top this one. Highly recomended!!
B00009TB5G|5.0|Oh, my. I cannot believe how much better this was than the theatrical release. Even that was nearly perfect. Now, I'd say this is the perfect movie. Extended and new scenes added so much to the film, and they were placed in perfectly. I'm very glad the Faramir scenes were added. Definitely fixed it a lot. Everything about this movie is great. I haven't watched the appendices yet, but I did find Smeagol/Gollum's MTV award. It was hilarious. Watch it. NOW!!!<br />Just 2.5 weeks til Return of the King!
0312263120|4.0|Digital Fortress by Dan Brown is a book that will make you think, not only about how powerful computers are and what people can do with them, but you will also think about the power the government has to eavesdrop on you. <br />If you have read other Dan Brown books, you will not be disappointed by his first novel Digital Fortress.  Digital Fortress is a fast moving thriller that will take you around the world, and also inside the NSA.  There are some twists and turns that make the story move along very well.  There might be a bit too much globe trotting to seem realistic, but all in all it makes for a very fun read.<br />Dan Brown uses very short chapters in Digital Fortress that makes for a quick read.  You keep thinking, ok one more chapter, and before you know it you are done with the book.  The climax is a bit unbelievable, but still makes for an interesting section of the book.<br />There were a couple of things that I did not really like about the book, first being that it seems like this book was written to be a movie, and sometimes that takes away from the character development like it did in this case.  Second the ending was very predictable, but all in all I would recommend Digital Fortress as a fun read!
B00009W0U4|4.0|I bought this because Time magazine gave it a high rating.  Now I honestly can't believe that I was able to buy it at Best Buy, or any large American retail store, for that matter.  You certainly wouldn't find it at Wal-Mart.  My stomach is still churning, and I believe the film's director would be very pleased to hear me say that; upsetting your stomach seems to be at least 75% of the film's intention, beginning as early as the presentation of the credits.  Within the first minute of the film, the camera's movements will make you queasy, and the majority of the scenes that follow are just more of the same.  But the brutality of the movie's two most shocking moments is unparalleled.  It made me sick to my stomach and sick in my heart, with my jaw dropping to the floor.  Monica Bellucci is an INCREDIBLE actress, and an amazing and courageous woman, but at the same time, the film's voyeurism feels so wrong; it almost seems wrong for anyone to have particpated in making such a harsh film.  Yet the director seems almost gleeful while explaining all of the painstaking effort that went into the film, and the dvd box is covered with accolades from movie festivals all over the world.  What does this say about our society?  We are becoming numb, adn there is a new breed of entertainment on the horizon, geared towards total sensory overload.  Let me put it this way: I could have lived my whole life without needing to experience this movie, but thanks to Time magazine, now I have to live with what I saw.  If you like intense movie experiences, you won't be disappointed, and I DO, but it was still too much for me.  My suggestion is to stay away, you'll be better off.  Because I do believe horrors like the ones depicted really happen to good people, and that is what makes the film even more unbearable.  If that was the message the film was reaching for, believe me, it's better for you if you just read it in this review.  It will be much easier for you than going through this nightmarish film experience.<BR>But if you REALLY DUG this film, may I also suggest:  The Bad Lieutenant, Killing Zoe, and the rollercoaster ride that is Requiem for a Dream; just bear in mind that all of these are outdone by Irreversible, in my opinion.  Is that good or bad?  What's next, for God's sake?  And is there an excuse for this kind of entertainment?  Should it be accessible to all on the video shelf?  Or maybe we should try to stop events like those depicted in the film from happening in real life instead of making movies about them.....The most haunting image in the film really is the pedestrian at the end of the tunnel, who has a chance to intervene before penetration even occurs, and instead sneaks away quietly, not wanting to get involved...
1567184855|5.0|Fascinating account by a hypnotherapist of accounts given to him by his clients of their recollections under hypnosis of their recollections of their soul decisions to incarnate and life between incarnations.<br />29 Case studies are presented and the fact that there are so many suggests that they all can't be &quot;making it up&quot;. This is how I came to believe that NDE's occurred...the constant case studies all saying the same thing.<br />I like the raw evidence rather than the subjective interpreation and theorising by the author. Would like to see more cases.<br />Also I am looking for my &quot;soul group&quot; Souls who decided with me to incarnate for a purpose. Hope I find them!
B00008DDRX|4.0|Sure, this film is not Citizen Kane or anything, but it is really quite good.  I guess people tend to write it off because it is a &quot;racing movie&quot;.  It does have a simple plot and, as many others have pointed out,  minimal dialogue.  But this film says a lot in a subtle way -- something you never see in movies today.  <br />The late 60's/early 70's were such a great time for cars and racing, and this movie captures the essence of that period in motorsports.  Actually the cars themselves would not look out of place at all today.  But this was a long time ago -- before NASCAR ;-) -- and these cars were not so high-tech as they might look.  Racing was far more dangerous then than it is now; drivers were getting killed all the time as I recall (I was 14 when &quot;Le Mans&quot; was released).  &quot;Le Mans&quot; really makes you feel what it must have been like to be a racer back then.  It is a study of contrast between dull, quiet &quot;real life&quot; outside the race and the vitality, urgency and danger of competition that motivates the drivers.<br />&quot;Le Mans&quot; is one of the only two good auto racing movies that were ever made.  (The other is Grand Prix, which is unfortunately not yet available on DVD.)  It is a completely visual movie -- you MUST see the DVD version in widescreen format, with its superior video/audio quality; way too much is lost in the VHS version.  The action footage is truly incredible, especially when one considers that this was 1971.  If you like cars/racing and movies, &quot;Le Mans&quot; should be in your collection.
B00003CWL6|3.0|Nearly every year there is one film that has a lot of good qualities, but critics seem to over-praise and over-hype it to the level of a Citizen Kane or a Casablanca.  In 1999, that film was American Beauty.  It is contains lots of morally charged themes and tangents, but not really that much to say. <br />The story itself starts out in the narrative-from-beyond-the-grave style like Sunset Boulevard, in which Lester (played masterfully by Kevin Spacey) describes his shallow and hopeless existence.  He is stuck in a dead-end job that he hates, his wife is an endlessly perky on the surface (but a vicious gold digger/adulteress beneath) suburban professional mom, his daughter is a sullen loner and he can only find solace from these suburban ills in masturbation.<br />Lester decides that he is \\"mad as hell and not going to take it anymore\\" and rebels against his shallow and oppresive suburban existence by: quitting his job and blackmailing his boss into giving him a year's pay, smoking pot, lusting after a girl more than half his age (and working out to impress her), buying a fast car without consulting the wife, and taking a fast food job (because it requires the least amount of responsibility).  In other words, he escapes a shallow and oppressive suburban adult existence by reverting to a shallow suburban adolesence.<br />If the quandry that Lester is in doesn't look all that oppresive to people, the writers ratchet up the oppresive quotient by introducing the Marine Corps neighbor: Colonel Fitts.  Fitts is a caricature straight from Hollywood's neurotic suburbia playbook.  (...)  Col. Fitts, along with Lester's wife, are the least satisfying and most stereotypical in the picture.<br />Out of the entire cast Jane (Thora Birch) seems to be the only one who recognizes the symptoms and the correct cure.  She knows that she desperately needs structure in her life and won't find it from her father or her mother (and most likely not her \\"beauty\\" obssessed boyfriend).<br />Among the muck described above, there are a few bright spots in the film.  Kevin Spacey is frankly riveting as Lester.  Even though the character is essentially a riff on the character he played in The Ref, he still acts with such verve as to truly deserve the academy award that he won for this role.  In fact, I think its primarily because of Spacey's greatness in this role that so many people have given the entire film such effusive praise.  The cinematography and the score are both excellent as well.<br />In conclusion, while I found some of the film to be excellent and beyond compare of most cinematic releases; taken as a whole, I found it to be less-than-satisfying.
B0000DD7NL|5.0|Alicia has done it again. She proves that she has staying power and a shelf life that will last well after all her counterparts have fallen by the wayside. What this album shows is her continued maturity and her refusal to be labelled or targetted by mainstream media. She does her own thing and does not need to compete with anyone. In fact, I can't see any female singer even wanting to test her. The success of \\"You don't know my name\\" will surpass even Alicia's expectations. We can all confess to having a secret admirer but how many of us were brave enough to act on those feelings. What can I say - track after track the listener is constantly in a state of anticipation and the album never falls to satisfy that anticipation either. <br />NOW FOR THE HATERS - because, no doubt, the haters will start filling up the reviews with their nasty comments.  Let me get a few things straight.<BR>Can anyone of you write music, sing & play piano at 22 ? - Well sit down.<BR>Can anyone of you get No.1 hits without having to resort to stripping naked and shaking ... all over your video ? -  Well sit down.<BR>Do any of you have the maturity and integrity that Miss Keys has ? - well sit down.  Right, how many of you are still standing ?? - WELL, I REST MY CASE.<br />Alicia is a humble, well brought up, unique & talented woman who will continue to make brilliant music for years to come.
B0000DCYVT|3.0|some crude jokes down it but there's always something good in this movie with Stifler dancing in the gay bar and the tension between Stifler and Finch while their pinting over Michelle's sister played by January Jones. the beginning with Alyson Hannigan under the table with Jim is just, wow, Alyson Hannigan is a crazy chick and again Finch gets Stifler's mom. The third slice is an ok view.
B0000B3FCX|1.0|This is in response to the reviewer who compaired this cd to Metallica's Black Album.  Compairing these two cds is about like comparing a Kia Sedan to a Ferrai.  What are you thinking, you idiot?
B0000A02TZ|1.0|Add me to the list of people who loved the original, but will not buy this post-fabricated POS loaded with commercials.
B0000CDLA7|4.0|Okay, all these negative reviewers, upset that this doesn't &quot;sound&quot; like what they expected, need to get over themselves. The band has every right to move in another direction if they want to. It's called &quot;growth.&quot; So if you don't like it, fine. But that doesn't make it bad ...<br />I'm just finishing my second time through the disc, and while I'll agree it's not what I expected, I DO like it. Granted I'm not your TYPICAL DT fan - &quot;Falling Into Infinity&quot; is my favorite album, I prefer the second disc of 6DOIT to the first, and I'm a sucker for their more ballad-y material. But I liked this disc right off the bat. And while &quot;As I Am&quot; sounds more like Metallica than even Metallica does these days, It's a GREAT track. And there's even a ballad-y track (&quot;Vacant&quot;) with strings even !<br />As you probaly already read, this is a much darker, more metal, album than DT has done in recent years. But as I said in my opening paragraph, if that's what they want to do - Great ! I like seeing bands stretching out. And on it's own merits, it's a great effort. But if you're expecting something like &quot;Awake&quot; or &quot;Scenes From A Memory&quot; you're in for a surprise. Just listen with open ears &amp; an open mind.
B00006SFBD|5.0|These guys blew me away!! Amazing musicians the Pink Floyd of metal. Go buy this right now its worth any amount of money.
068484267X|5.0|I always recommend this book to my friends by saying &quot;It's the most hilarious book about starving to death&quot;. Which is not too far off.<br />What makes this story so great is not what happens in it - it is the &quot;tone&quot; and how it is told. Everything being seen through the eyes of a little boy makes even the worst things seem humorous.<br />His sense of character is great. The people almost jump off the page.<br />I laughed and was very moved by this book. I highly recommend it.<br />PS: The movie has some good performances but never meets the magic of this book. The &quot;tone&quot; is missing.
B0000TB03W|5.0|SHANIA'S UP ( Live in Chicago ) DVD is a MUST-HAVE for any SHANIA fan, let alone, your DVD collection!  You can't beat SHANIA'S great music and UP-beat energy you get from watching this DVD!
B00006IUL7|3.0|Al Pacino does and excellent acting job in this movie. It is also a well written piece about character and &quot;choices&quot;. It just gets a little lost towards the end and not as suspenseful as it should be. (A near car accident is scarier than the confrontation with the killer etc)<br />The biggest problem is the casting or maybe the interpretation of the role by Robin Williams. He is so likeable that it's almost like Mr. Rogers the killer. It does not work and ultimately makes this a film that doesn't work. There is no menace to him - someone like Kevin Spacey would have been much better. (altho no one has ever really beaten Anthony Perkins' incredible acting job in Psycho as a likeable killer)<br />Rent or buy this because it is much better than the &quot;paint by numbers&quot; suspense movies we usually get. You know the &quot;Killer goes after the investigators wife and kids&quot; etc plot. It was actually written about choices of loyalty, Honesty and what matters the most. (Do ends justify means etc)
0312319517|5.0|Forsyth does it again and proves that he still is a master of suspense and intrigue.  As always, the book has you gripped in excitement and is informative as well.  Another new author who is worth reading for her informative suspense-writing, is Glynnis Hayward ,whose debut novel &quot;A TELLING TIME,&quot;(ISBN 1591295912)set in the violence of a troubled South Africa, is every bit as nail-biting as Forsyth's work.
0385720920|4.0|I will try not to give any spoilers here.  Its characters are classic chuck, the main character is a sex addict that works at a historical theme park, and they just get more interesting from there.  They are strange characters, yes, but easy to relate to and motivated by very primal instincts.  Not a book to read to your mother.  Its riddled with more of his very unique dark humor that is in Lullaby and Survivor.  Also, Chuck inserts his little \\"tips\\" in life that they dont teach you in school, they might be from the anarchist cookbook.  Things like what all the secret code phrases that are announced over PA systems, and how to make easy money at fine dining places.  Its a quick read, flows nicely, a few of the scenes are unnecessary, but a good book over all. In chuck we trust indeed.
B00005JM0B|3.0|I can´t really faind a reson why this saga should go on. Terminator 3 is weak, in fact, very weak, but I do consider that it does possesses a very strong ending. An ending that was not quite good put together with the rest of the movie. I think that being a third sequel to a very powerful saga that should had been keept in only two shapters, this third instalment has 3 mayor flaws. I won´t go deep into details coz I don´t want to spoil the movie. But you should keep this elements in mind when you watch the film.<br />1) Character development. The film starts focusing in the adolence of John Connor and then drops mercifully into a shallow grave of inconcistancy. The characters are way superficial, beyond any other mayor movie. John Connors character is weak, boring and unrepresenting. Even though he was expecting the terminators, he is unfabricated. Claire danes character was just a simple excuse to put John connor into a relationship. She´s incredibly predictable and I don´t think it was of any help for the story. the terminator has become a full time CLICHE machine of the past 2 movies...he repeats the notorius line I´ll be back like 20 times. The way he moves, act and tries to be funny is pathetic...what a waste!!It wasn´t Arnold´s fault, is just that the script was very ververy bad put together. And over all, the acting was horrible!!!<br />2. Plot. There is hardly any plot to tell you the truth, but the usual run and hide rutine now famous from the 2 previews films. In my opinion, the reason why skinet is trying to destroy the world is incoherent and I don´t think the movie shows any good intention to explain it. Now, the main reason why the machines attack in this movie is coMpletely PATHETIC!!!!!! <BR>To much repetitious action that leaded no where and there is ZERO TENTION  in any part of the movie. I think the plot was awful.<br />3. CGI effects. Almost every american film is crowded with tons of FX. There´s not a sinlge effect in the movie that you havent seen before done better...that´s all I have to say!!!!<br />If the movie would have been more character based, a better reason to fight instead of personal issues, a more nerver wrecking plot and better CGI effects, it would had been incredible because the ending was a mayor surprise to tell you the truth.<br />wacth it but do not expect too much!!!! you wont find it here....
B00005LOUP|4.0|I must admit, when I first saw &quot;Grinch,&quot; I didn't know what to expect. The critics completely apalled it, but most of those who had seen it said it was very good. All I can say is: The critics, as they often are, were wrong.         <br />Jim Carrey is his usual self in a role that no one else could have played as well. This part was the perfect match to his acting. His verbal and physical humour will have you howling.<br />And kudos to the set designer and the make-up artists. Both are slendid, and make this movie a holiday treat for the entire family. Ron Howard did a magnificent job bringing this beloved tale to the big screen. <br />Be sure to buy it, especially if you have kids. It will become a holiday tradition to watch... and enjoy.
B0000CDLA7|2.0|I'm never sure what to expect with each Dream Theater album, but I always know that I'll be treated to good, loud, origional progressive-metal music. Not this time, unfortunately. Guitar god Petrucci is just randomly playing notes during his &quot;solos&quot;. And didn't Dream Theater have a keyboardist? Can't tell by listening to this. <BR>Progressive rock doesn't just mean that you throw in a keyboard, it means that each album builds off of the previous--in a way, the band evolves. Each Dream Theater album has been like this...except for this one. This is more like de-evolution. It's almost as if they forgot that they're one of the greatest bands out there and said &quot;Hey, let's just throw a bunch of stuff together and crank the volume way up.&quot; Maybe the side projects are to blame, I don't know; I like all the side projects and I hope that those continue but not at the expense of the band.<BR>I know there's people out there who will tell me that if I want to hear an album like Images and Words that I should just listen to Images and Words...I say that this album is just a bad imitation of Metallica and if I wanted to hear a band like Metallica I'd listen to Metallica (but not anything released by them within the last 7 or so years...blah)

B0000DD7NL|5.0|I, like several million other people worldwide, had the pleasure of partaking of Songs in A Minor. It was great.  It was original. It's a classic.  So when I purchased Diary of Alicia Keys the day it came out I knew it would be good. But I didn't know of the extent.  This entire cd is THE BOMB. Every single song is amazing.  If you don't get this cd you are missing out on some of the best music of the year and probably the year to come.  You can't hate on pure talent.  Alicia's voice is even better on this cd. It's fuller and you hear her effortlessly hitting notes we haven't heard her hit. GO GET IT!!!!!

B0000E1WKE|5.0|Let me go on the record and say that personally I think this is Whitney's BEST album to date but that's just my opinion. I just love this new Whitney style. Sometimes I think she's using too many runs, but she still finds a way to make it sound great. :) <br />I know people still want The Bodyguard Whitney but there's something about this new Whitney that is so special. :p From the arrangement, the voice, to the production, everything seems to mesh together. There is something different about the way she hits the high notes though. It doesn't sound like she's struggling when she's going for it, but it's much different then the old high notes Whitney used to hit. But I still love the new Whitney voice much more. :D<br />Here is my review:<br />1. The First Noel - Great start and great song. 9.5/10<br />2. The Christmas Song - Warm and beautiful at the same time. 9.5/10<br />3. Little Drummer Boy - Good arrangement and very well done. 9/10<br />4. One Wish - I agree not the best song but not the worst either. 8/10<br />5. O Holy Night - ####!!! 10000/10<br />6. I'll Be Home For Christmas - Good!! 9/10<br />7. Deck The Halls/Silent Night - VERY well done. 10/10<br />8. Have Yourself A Merry Little Christmas - Not bad, but I'm not too crazy about the song though. 8/10<br />9. O Come O Come Emanuel - The best song on the album! And you can tell that she was emotionally into this song. 10000/10<br />10. Who Would Imagine A King - They should have left this off. 6/10<br />11. Joy To The World - Nice exit, and this song was the best song on The Preachers Wife, but not on this album. 9.5/10<br />The best is yet to come!<br />JOE :D

B00009XITP|5.0|I think this is a good film waether you are a boy or a girl, a child or a teen, or an adult or senior, there is something for everyone, but I guess the film is aimed at teen girls, for the plot(fairytale), and at teen boys(Amanda wears plenty of short tight mini skirts).  I creamed in my jeans when I saw Amanda in the 1st seen laying on the couch in a super tiny mini skirt!  In anycase everyone will love this film, it's good for the entire family.

Its the Last In Line, awakening the Elves inside of us all. Hear Vivian Campbell's greatest guitar work (IMO), Vinnie Appice's thundering drums, Jimmy Bain's subtle bass lines. This is one of the blueprints of POWER METAL! Better than the debut, arguably better than anything after. Metal fans- Buy it NOOOOOWOOWOOOWWWW!
B00008BXJG|5.0|AC/DC' HIGHWAY TO HELL is a metal classic.  Big beat, loud guitars, and a singer who sounds like he has been to hell and back.  All that combined with lyrics about women, booze, parties, drugs,  sex, and going to hell in a fast car. AC/DC was ripe for a good cd, and producer Robert Lang pushed them to that height.  I MAY NOT AGREE with the lyrics, because all of their lyrics are the same, but the sound will floor you.
B00000J048|4.0|My daughter has always been drawn to visual spatial toys and loves playing with gears.  She started getting independent with this around 3 years of age.  I love the Discovery toy version as well.
B000089RV6|5.0|BACK IN BLACK is a rock classic.  Not only did this group, make on of the best rock cds of all time, but they did it with a new lead screamer.  Many of these songs can still be heard on the radio today, YOU SHOOK ME ALL NIGHT LONG, BACK IN BLACK, HELL'S BELLS, and HAVE A DRINK ON ME.  The subject matter of the songs are still the same, sex, drugs, booze, and rock-n-roll, and rebellion.  But the sound has same, not just from a new lead singer, but prodution wise.  Again Robert Lang as worked his magic on this cd, as he did with their last cd, HIGHWAY TO HELL.  One has to wonder, if the group would have hit as big as they did, if it wasn't for Robert?
0060976624|5.0|Good job. Great fun!!!<BR>The ending is kind of weak,but before you there you got a lot of fun.
B000002AEN|5.0|Mississippi John Hurt possessed a gentle and timeless voice and guitar playing skill. His guitar work is considered to be some of the greatest, and most complicated, in all of American music, and his voice is immediately soothing to even the savage beast. Songs like \\"Frankie,\\" \\"Ain't No Tellin',\\" and \\"Avalon Blues\\" will surely leave many students of guitar simply breathless. To those who do not play any musical instruments, his flowing guitar technique is still dazzling, and his voice is more \\"homey\\" and \\"likeable\\" than perhaps anyone else's, even the great Louis Armstrong's. As a darling of the Blues/Folk Revival of the 1960s, Hurt often played the Pre-War songs we hear on this disc, and almost just as well as he did back in the old days, one might add. This is a great disc for both the musician and the listener in us all.
B0000DD7NL|5.0|Hands down, Keys has done it again. I'm in love with NeoSoul as it is, and here she comes raising the bar again. Way to go Alicia. Now just come on tour to Indianapolis IN and we'll be good to go. I like all the songs, but my faves are the single, You don't know my name, Dragon Days, Diary, HeartBurn and the interlude Feelin U feelin me. If you were reading reviews to make a decision on whether or not to cop this disc, let me be the one to tell you to go right ahead and do it. All Keys' fans should be very proud of her on this one.
0140271791|4.0|This book had me laughing and crying.  It's a great story, well written, very funny and very sad at the same time.<BR>I liked Lucy Sullivan better, but another score for Keyes with this book. If you like brittish authors and brittish humour, you'll like this one!
0783231032|3.0|If I continue saying that I love expanded editions and end up criticizing them, people will kill me.  Unfortunately I have to say that &quot;1941&quot; is one of those editions.<br />When I first saw the movie, I found it hilarious that I barely understood why it was a flop at the box office.  As a matter of fact I still do.  Now comes the expanded director's cut of this so-called &quot;comedy spectacular&quot;.  Hey, new scenes, new dialogue -I have no problem with that.  Once again, I have to criticize it because these new developments make the film longer and a bit boring.  The only new scene that I really enjoyed from this cut is when the Japanese soldiers are disguised as Christmas trees, and there is Hollis Wood (Slim Pickens) trying to cut them down -now that was hilarious.<br />In general terms, I love the &quot;Jaws&quot; spoof when the same girl who was attacked in Steven Spielberg's first hit is attacked by...gulp!...a sub periscope.  I also love the screaming when Wild Bill Kelso's (John Belushi) planes crashes down on Hollywood Boulevard.  I like many things about this movie.  However, as I said before, Spielberg's cut of the movie is somewhat dull.<br />As for the special features, I have to say that the &quot;Making Of&quot; documentary is insightful, but a bit long -was that necessary to record every Bob Gale detail regarding whatever happened after the attack on Pearl Harbor?  Interesting deleted scenes, some of them without audio.  Finally, I really love the isolated track of John Williams' spectacular music score.  All in all, this DVD is interesting and somewhat enjoyable.
B00000I9MK|5.0|Belle and Sebastian's 1996 debut still sounds as fresh today as it did when it was released.  If anything this proves the band to have been talented beyond their years when they recorded this, and shows that a timeless classic is a timeless classic, no matter whose bathroom it was recorded in...While often accused of being one-dimensional, the strength of this record lies in its diversity. Huge ranges in tempo, style and sound pervade this album, which in all its lo-fi glory is remarkably short.<br />For me the best song, and the best song they've ever done, is album opener &quot;The State I'm In&quot;.  As a manifesto and a call to arms it has never been excelled, and as a classic shaggy dog story, I doubt it ever will be!  You can almost feel the joy Stuart derives from telling his stories and spitting out his acutely observed and intricate lyrics (&quot;got married in a rush to save a kid from being deported, now she's in love...&quot;) and the album's sugar rush is insanely infectious.<br />The lyrical obsessions with buses, lesbianism and religion are already in place, and the band's charm is allowed to shine through the dodgy production.<br />This is a warm, heartbreakingly beautiful and affecting record and it deserves your attention.<br />PS.  Listen closely at the start of track two -  just before the vocals come in there's a weird noise. It's Stuart self-consciously zipping up his cardigan as he steps up to the mic to sing! How cute!!
0767817486|1.0|I watched the movie as a citizen of Turkish Republic. It is a true story? If it is, it is prefectly Ok to show the unfairness of a prison life however they can NOT generalize to its society what happened in the prison. My only recommendation those who are judging turkish people just because of this movie is to watch 'Sleepers'. Unfairness can happen in prison life but there is no need to have very racist dialogues in the movie.
B00000AFHM|4.0|&quot;The Boy with the Arab Strap&quot; for me shows a band unsure where to go.  After the success of the low budget &quot;If you're feeling sinister&quot; album the band finally have the money to record an orchestral masterpiece that showcases the range they are capable of.  Instead Stuart Murdoch bottles it. He lets his friends write and sing their own songs and the result is a somewhat incoherent and largely self-indulgent album.  The lack of direction is best illustrated by looking at the center of the album. The magnificent &quot;Summer Wasting&quot; is followed up by &quot;Seymour Stein&quot;, an attack at the famous record exec that comes across as childish and petulant, and &quot;Space boy dream&quot;, where Stuart David showcases his poetry skills for the last time before leaving to concentrate on his &quot;Looper&quot; side project. &quot;Dirty dream number two&quot; also has a certain filler feel to it, leaving the title track, which is possibly the best track on the album, horrifically unsupported and practically carrying the rest of the album.  Perhaps it was writers block, or perhaps the others nagged him for more record space, but compare &quot;Chickfactor&quot; to &quot;The Boy with the Arab Strap&quot; and then tell me this is Belle and Sebastian at their best...<br />&quot;It's good - but it's not right&quot;.<br />P.S. The titular Arab Strap is a marital aid that constrictively enhances staying power. I don't believe it's available through amazon.com...
B00009V8Z9|5.0|I had the chance to see him live (opening for Maroon 5), to be honest, i would much rather have him stay on stage for the rest of the show because Gavin is such an incredible performer, songwriter&amp;singer. His stage presence is endearing and it convinced me to buy this cd (confession: i previously downloaded the songs) and it has not left my cd player. i even grew to love the songs i previously thought of as 'mediocre'. There is nothing mediocre about Gavin DeGraw.
B00008H2LB|5.0|I loved the Hybrid Theory album. The track In The End sucked me into the CD and other artists such as Adema. When I heard about Meteora being released I was very excited. I have to say, this is no dissapointment. The songs connect to me even more than Hybrid Theory's (esp. Faint, Numb, &amp; Nobody's Listening). They each have their own unique tone and feel to them. To sum it up, get this CD if you liked Hybrid Theory, get it if you liked one song on Hybrid Theory, or get this if you've only heard one track from it (like Somewhere I Belong) and like it.
B0000DD7NL|3.0|I was somewhat dissapointed with &quot;The Diary Alicia Keys&quot;.  I was expecting it to be better then &quot;Songs In A Minor&quot;, which is one of the best albums of all time.  The songs seem real repetitious in this album.  &quot;The Diary...&quot; does have some gems, You Don't Know My Name and If I Ain't Got You.  I also really enjoy the two interludes.  The production and arrangements in all the songs are well done.<br />It is important to note that while this album may be a dissapointment to myself, it is definately better then 90% of the albums out in today's world of music.  Alicia certainly is a fresh sight to the scene.
B0000AQVCL|5.0|man o man this was an awesome cd i couldnt have pictured a better new band i mean if u like the old 70's and early 80's stuff but your tired of hearing the same old great songs from the past pick up this cd right now becaeu its is all rock and alljam baby so if u liek rock u willlove this cd and if u like the 70's this is what your talking about!!!
B0000E1WKE|5.0|For the guy who reviewed with one star..sir you are SADLY MISTAKEN! Whitney Houston is definitely back with her new Christmas Album. I was just like you, waiting for another horrible performance but I ABSOLUTELY LOVED IT!! This is a MAJOR STEP UP from \\"Just Whitney\\" . Whitney has had her problems and we are all human :)..anyway its proven in this album that her voice is back to what i recognize it being long ago. She still can vocalize well and the best songs on this album are: Joy To The World, Little Drummer Boy (w/ her daughter Bobbi Kristina), The Christmas Song... thats just for starters. You Will love EVERYTHING about this album! Her Daughter's featured solo on \\"Little Drummer Boy\\" was excellent and just shows that those vocal skills run in the family..shes going to be a great singer. Go and buy it and see for yourself!<BR>This is one of her best works yet.
0385504209|4.0|This is my first Dan Brown book and I must admit, I was a little leery reading this book because of the book's popularity. Sometimes popular does not always mean better. However, 'The Da Vinci Code' is the exception. You do not need an extensive background in art or religion to enjoy this book. Mr. Brown covers those areas in detail in an easy understandable format. If you come from a religious background you may (or may not) accept the writings in the book.<br />Please keep an open mind.
B0000C6E4D|1.0|Ok, how do you like paying full price for half an hour worth of music. not nice. she's done it before - again and again. she's known for ripping off her fans like this. she's mean. artists like these are the reason why the music industry is going down hill. this is why people download music for free off the internet and opt not to buy her cd's. she's contributing to the conflict in our recording industry by releasing left overs from previous sessions, and packaging it as a cd , to line her pocket book. this has got to stop. i wont support this artist and you shouldn't either
B00005JLRT|1.0|I am a huge star trek fan, and this is the worst star trek film ever, I promise.  As I said in the title of my review, I would rather suffer through a first season episode of Voyager than watch this tripe again.  Horribly written, with zero regard for continuity or the consistency of characters, this ranks as a horrible film in all aspects. I like Insurrection a thousand times more than this film, and Insurrection was no great shakes.  Avoid this film, it's a complete waste of time.  I guarantee!
B00008G9JN|4.0|&quot;Songs from the Wood&quot;, originally issued in 1977, is overlooked in the Jethro Tull catalogue. Perhaps this (very welcome) reissue (11 tracks; 53 min.) will reignite attention to this gorgeous collection.<br />I hadn't listened to this album in probably more than 15 years when I recently saw that it was reissued in a remastered version, and with liner notes from Ian Anderson to boot! I knew I had to buy it. &quot;Songs from the Wood&quot; boasts no hit singles (apart from the minor Christmas hit &quot;Ring Out Solstice Bells&quot;, which happens to be a very fine Christmas tune). It can be vaguely be described as a concept album, with songs celebrating life in the English country side. Musically, this album reminds me of the electric rock-folk of Steeleye Span and Fairport Convention, but of course with Jethro Tull's unique twist and Ian Anderson's instantly recognizable flute preminent. Stand-out songs include the title  track, &quot;Jack-in-the-Green&quot; (Anderson in the liner notes: &quot;It was all played by me one rainy Sunday afternoon, I wrote the piece in the morning, had lunch, and beetled off to record it while the idea was still in my head. I think we even mixed it in the same evening. Wow!&quot;), &quot;Ring Out Solstice Bells&quot; and &quot;Pibroch (Cap in Hand)&quot;, the only &quot;hard&quot; rocking song on the album, with Martin Barre's guitar upfront, but with an equally mesmorizing flute solo by Anderson. This reissue comes with 2 bonus tracks: &quot;Beltane&quot; is from the same sessions, but not nearly as delightful as the original album songs. &quot;Velvet Green&quot; is a live version of the album track.<br />If your idea of Jethro Tull is focused on/limited to &quot;Aqualung&quot;, &quot;Locomotion Breath&quot; and the like, then &quot;Songs from the Wood&quot; is not for you. If, however, you are looking for a great album featuring Jethro Tull music, then by all means buy this! You will not be disappointed.
0307120007|5.0|Our son inherited two identical copies of Pat the Bunny from his big sister (who adored the book equally), and he quickly learned all the fun things he could do with Paul and Judy. His favorite thing to do is to play peek-a-boo with Paul. We are disappointed that the binding has failed on both copies, but gladly, it is due to them being so LOVED. In order to keep our now-one-year-old boy happy, we are buying him a copy of his own for Christmas (and maybe a spare for the diaper bag for outings).A true favorite story-simple and fun! And a great gift to receive for a new baby.
B0000C7PSW|3.0|Unlike many here, I come here without any comparisons to previous Rufus albums, as this is the first Rufus album I have bought, and then only accidentally. I heard &quot;I Don't Know What It Is&quot; on the sampler CD  included in a recent Paste Magazine (great music magazine, incidentally), and was blown away, so I purchased the album.<br />&quot;Want One&quot; (14 tracks, 59 min.) starts off with a very intruiging &quot;Oh What a World&quot;, with an unmistaken inspiration from Ravel's &quot;Bolero&quot; if you can believe it. Then follows the afore-mentioned &quot;I Don't Know What It Is&quot;, for me the highlight of the album. The album's production is lush and rich, and it reminded me of eating Belgian chocolate: it's best consumed in moderation. There is simply so much here that after a while it becomes too much. Many tracks are good (&quot;Vicious World&quot;, &quot;Vibrate&quot;, &quot;Beautiful Child&quot; among them), and the closer &quot;Dinner at Eight&quot; is a nice way to close, with Rufus on piano, augmented by orchestra.<br />&quot;Want One&quot; is a good album, but overlong. I find myself playing  3 or 4 tracks at one time and then again some other time another 3 or 4 tracks. Supposedly Rufus is thinking about issuing a sequel (&quot;Want Two&quot;). I'll probably end up buying it as well, and will play that one in moderation as well.
B0000TB05A|5.0|This is one of the best DVD's I have ever bought. It has so much energy in it and is truly a awesome experience to watch this.Its got a awesome atmosphere with 160,00 odd screaming fans there, with about 60,000 more people more present than the Elevation DVD. Every track stands out and Bono's vocals. This is very, very good. Go out and buy it if your a true U2 fan.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|This was the best series to hit television in years, only to be cancelled by the bean counters at Fox who didn't even give it a chance (the same with Keen Eddie).  The overwhelming praise here is testament to the idiocy of the networks.  What is Fox up to now?  THE SIMPLE LIFE!?  If Paris Hilton in the new version of beauty, I envy the blind!  If Universal indeed picked up the option for a movie, perhaps one of the networks will cancel ENTERPRISE and replace it with this jewel!  NBC cancelled JAG and CBS picked it up and ran with it.  It's happened before, it can happen again.
B0000DD7LB|1.0|If she only would come back to Stockholm and work with her creators again, there is still some time to save her.. Im sorry, but i couldnt even hear that it was Britney on the record. I thought it was someone else when I first heard this cd at a friends house. I didnt like what I was hearing. I think it is very bad when there is so much mixing and producing going on that the artist vanish in the backup vocals and all the instruments. What are they trying to hide? Her career is over and has been for a while now. I like Britney and I liked her Oops I did it again album. But that was in the golden days. It is over now.
0156027321|5.0|When first hearing about the story, I thought it just a fantasy, a fairy tale with some kind of moral, and of course, it is. However, as I read Pi's tale, I was drawn in.  I liked Pi and Richard Parker and I gave the story the benefit of the doubt. Using animal psychology and a few well-timed storms and swarms of flying fish, it could happen.  As I was coming to the end of the novel, I was feeling satisfied and content.  Consequently, I was shocked when Pi, faced with skeptical interviewers, offers a different story of what happened, one of unspeakable cruelty, selfishness, murder and terror.  I felt silly for having been drawn into this fantasy, and a bit disappointed to have it shattered. But hey, that's life right?  I felt compelled to dismiss the &quot;story&quot;, for what appears to be the more likely &quot;truth&quot;.  But must I?  Pi asks the now satisfied interviewers to question their \\"choice\\" of what to believe.  The endings are the same, he survived months at sea, everyone is dead, there is no evidence supporting either story.  Does it matter which really happened?  And how do you know which is true?  Which is the better story? And with that Pi allows the reader to return to believing the, perhaps unlikely, better story.  Ultimately, it may be the truth, but if its not it doesn't matter.  In life, we can be skeptical and tend to accept ugliness as the more likely reality.  But when it really doesn't matter and you will never really know, why not choose your story, choose what to believe.  Pi shows us that we will never know so why not have faith.  One can have faith in people, the universe or God. The tragedy would be reaching the end of your life and realizing that the truth was the fantasy and you missed the better story.
B00004TJWE|5.0|It's a shame the Pretty Things' &quot;SF Sorrow&quot; never had the commercial impact of its Abbey Road contemporaries', &quot;Piper at the Gates of Dawn&quot; and &quot;Sgt. Peper&quot; (Pink Floyd and the Beatles respectively). Though sales were modest, the album spawned an interest in conceptual music and greatly influenced bands like The Who, CA Quintet and yes, Pink Floyd. And when you listen to the music, you can see why.<BR> &quot;SF Sorrow&quot; examines the life of Sabastian F. Sorrow. A young man who's seen war, loss and deceit and ultimately withdraws himself from society.<BR> It isn't your typical organ and fuzzed out guitar psych album. Most of the acid trip relies on the masterful production (very close to what you would hear on Pink Floyd's &quot;Wish You Were Here&quot;) and an appealing mixture of British folk and eastern music (of course, with a 60s twist). Still, it's not pretentious and boring like most concept albums. The Pretties never cease to serve up some tasty hooks to keep you groovin!
0671027573|5.0|I recently discovered Linda Howard and can only say I love this author.  She writes great romance intermingled with comedy and mystery, and is absolutely the best at creating sexual tension between her characters.  Cannot wait to read another one by Ms. Howard.
B0000CFW87|5.0|There are not enough superlatives to describe the quality of Josh Groban's offerings on this sophomore CD. There are 4 languages besides English, 3 songs cowritten by Josh with very interesting twists to his already gorgeous vocals, wider range, more complex music, he plays piano...there's so much more to this artist that we're just beginning to glimpse.  He has a very bright future, unlimited potential for success in his self-created musical niche. Thank God he was able to avoid the pidgeon-hole fate of some other talented artists so he can freely explore who he is and what he wants to say through music.<BR>I'll be eagerly awaiting his tour and look forward to supporting him and following his career for many years to come.
B000066NW0|5.0|So everyone's talking about her image and crowning her the &quot;anti-Britney.&quot; Love her or hate her image.  But I say: who cares! <br />I listen to all genre of music, so I tend to focus on the quality of the songs and not the background of the artist.  The bottomline is that this CD is good!  She may use the same 3-5 chords in her songs and her voice is above average at best, but we're not reviewing a classical composer and his orchestra. She's a pop singer! And her pop songs sound great. Every song, from the hugely successful singles (Complicated, I'm With You, Sk8er Boi) to her not-so-radio-friendly songs are incredibly enjoyable to listen to.  Not one song disappoints.  She puts emotion into her songs and her lyrics are actually meaningful, as opposed to the shallow lyrics most pop singers are coming out with now.<br />Forget she's pop punk and dresses weird (although I have to admit, she's cute!).  Forget she's Canadian and a bit flakey.  She puts out good music, and that's all that counts.
B0000CNY27|5.0|It took two long agnoying years but its finally here.. There a DVD GOD.I am so looking forward to buying the Escape from New York  Special Edition.But it seems now we have to wait to buy the Special Editions of our favorite movies... talk about being held DVD hostage by the companies who produce them..The one edition I will not be happy to see soon is the escape From LA that movie was god awful.. Anyways 2-Disc set should be entertaining for the right price...There is NO escaping the DVD Companies..
0385508417|3.0|Skipping Christmas is a really good book. It is short and to the point. Has a wonderful twist at the end and is heartfelt and enjoyable. I will say it is not the most interisting most adventurious or most gripping books i've read, but I really did enjoy it. I could sit down and read it in a day. The reader doesn't do much thinking in this book, but on a large scale the issue at hand makes a suprising impact. (Especially since i read it on December 3rd) The characters are delightfully average and really hit home. Like i said before i liked this book. It was corkey, fun, and an overall nice story.
B000059PR5|5.0|I had just turned twelve years old a month before this movie came out, and I had been enamored with atomic and thermonuclear weapons from about age 9 when I saw the movie Enola Gay.  My family and I watched this movie together, and I was awestruck by the devastation depicted on screen.  As a child of the eighties, I remember this movie setting the tone for a lot of anti-nuke movements, songs, art, and even more movies about the horrors of nuclear war.  I also remember thinking then, and now, that if this movie were even slightly true, why would the owners of such devastating devices ever use them?  Well, I believe that is the point of why the film was made.  I don't think that anyone in their right mind in 1982 would have ever called for unilateral disarmament in hopes that the other side would follow suit, and here's why:  Say I have a gun and you have a gun.  I pull the trigger to shoot you, and you have 30 seconds to pull your trigger and shoot me and neither of us can move from our position.  The first one to pull the trigger will die as well as the second one.  That's why this movie is important, because Ronald Reagan changed his mind about winning a limited nuclear exchange with the Soviet Union after seeing this movie.  He finally realized that the US could never win a nuclear war, and the only way to prevent one was to ensure MAD (Mutually Assured Destruction) by the proliferation of nuclear arms.  Pulling the trigger first didn?t matter, because the other guy was going to pull his trigger too.  I also remember how the Europeans were upset by our staging of nukes in their countries, but they never realized that it was those nukes that kept them safe.  The peaceniks were so scared of nuclear war, that they were ready to surrender to the Soviet Union and their (ultimately failed, thank you Mr. Reagan!) version of socialism (communism), but Ronnie?s nukes kept the Reds out of Western Europe and the Western hemisphere.  Frankly, I am glad that the US has nukes,and is ready to use them at any given time to defend our country, as well as our allies.  I am also glad that we have a no first strike policy to prevent the outbreak of nuclear war by some hothead a la Dr. Strangelove (my most favorite movie).  However, I would never want to see \\"the button\\" pushed, and millions people die horrifically.  So I continue to hope that the leaders of all countries who have nukes realize the dangers of an all out nuclear exchange, and adopt the same no first strike policy that the US has adopted.I had just turned twelve years old a month before this movie came out, and I had been enamored with atomic and thermonuclear weapons from about age 9 when I saw the movie Enola Gay.

B00009TB5G|5.0|This extended edition I feel is far superior to the theatrical release.
B00005JM02|4.0|The animation in this show is extraordinary. Disney, or more correctly Pixar, have achieved a stunning success (imagine if this level of animation were used in &quot;The Little Mermaid&quot;!) But there's more to an animated feature than the artistry and technical virtuosity, and that's where Nemo lets  us down a bit.<br />The secondary characters, Led By Ellen DeGeneres as Dory are outstanding and fully worthy of the artistry. Where I must quibble is with the main characters. The animation is highly three-dimensional, the secondary characters are three-dimensional, so why can't the two main characters be a little less from the Disney-esque mold of insipid two-dimensional wimps? I found the milquetoast father figure especially annoying. However, even Nemo himself isn't much better since he fails to fully grasp the cause and effect relationship between  his actions and their consequences. This is a common theme in Disney movies where a bratty kid gets in trouble and by the final frame all is forgotten. You never get the feeling that if another similar opportunity presented itself in the future that the kid would have learned enough to avoid it.<br />But, ah, those irrepressible kids, eh? Not a good life lesson for the little ones...<br />Otherwise, the story's pretty much straightforward Disney.  Engaging enough, but no real depth. An interesting contrast is the animated Sinbad movie released about the same time. Very idiosyncratic and somewhat disjointed animation, but a good story and characters with some depth. It even has a back story that unfolds as the adventure proceeds. I guess the suits at Disney don't give the kids enough credit to appreciate the difference.
0316666343|5.0|The Lovely Bones by Alice Sebold was a greatest book that I've ever read and I've read a lot of books it was happy and sad, it's still make me felt asleep, but this one I can read again and again.  This book is a fascinating novel from the beginning through the ending of chapter 23.  Susie Salmon is a 14-year-old girl, crime victim (raped and murdered), and spirit; Lindsey Salmon is a sister of Susie; Bucky Salmon is a 4-year-old boy, brother of Susie; and Mr. Harvey is a murderer, serial killer, and neighbor of Susie.  Whoever read this book I guess you like it too right?  The Lovely Bones was a good book, when I started to read for a few chapters I felt really bad for Susie and my favorite part was when she got to come down from heaven it made me cry and I had a smile at the same time she got to be with her first kiss.  <BR> What I like about this book is that a young girl that she been through a lot of things that people never been through those things likes her and people that never knows.  A young girl raped and murdered when she was only 14 year old.  When we first meet Susie, she is already in heaven.  She has to face her life in heaven and as she looks down from the strange new place, she tells us, in the fresh and spirited voice a young girl, a tale that is both haunting and full of hope.  \\"My name was Salmon, like the fish; first name, Susie.  I was fourteen when I was murdered on December 6, 1973.\\"(p.5) These are what I like this book about!!!  <BR> The Lovely Bones by Alice Sebold's haunting and heartbreaking debut novel, unfolds from heaven, where \\"life is a perpetual yesterday\\" and where Susie narrates and keeps watch over her grieving family and friends, as well as her own version of heaven.  The Lovely Bones works as an odd yet affecting coming of age story.  Susie struggles to accept her death while still clinging to the lost world of the living, following her family's dramas over the years.  In it holds the key to why she could write and transmit to us a nightmare horror, for she was raped on her way home.  I cried for Susie, because she was frozen in a child like a body, while watching her sister and her brother grow up, the end of her parent's marriage and eventually her mother's transformation.  Sebold orchestrates a big finish and though things tend to wrap up a little too well for everyone in the end, one can only imagine that heaven is indeed a place filled with such happy endings.  <BR> If you felt like to read then go ahead and read.  If you don't want to read and don't like this book then don't give me a word!!  Because I think it's a great novel to read.
B0000B1OFL|1.0|Noisy, Unimaginative, Poor acting. Need I say more?????????<br />Sorry I wasted 99 cents to rent this movie. One of those movies I watched to the end thinking it had to get better, but it never did. The sound was so irritating I turned it down to the minimum volume which I could still hear the talking. Don't ask me why I wanted to hear that, I haven't figured that out yet.
B000001EGA|4.0|...to me this is Elton's best album.  It represents everything good in Elton John music: chock full of memorable lyrics and tunes you find yourself singing long after they're done.<br />You get some of Elton's greatest hits (\\"Someone Saved My Life Tonight,\\" \\"Philadelpia Freedom,\\" and his cover of \\"Lucy in the Sky With Diamonds\\") along with lesser known masterpieces (\\"Curtains,\\" \\"Tower of Babel,\\" and \\"We All Fall in Love Sometimes\\").  All in all, the album as a whole is nothing short of fantastic.  I'm able to put it on and listen to it straight through without having to hit the advance button.<br />\\"Curtains\\" is probably my favorite song on the album: \\"I used to know this old scarecrow, he was my song, my joy and sorrow...\\"  You also get the added bonus of three singles that weren't on the original album: \\"Philadelphia Freedom,\\" \\"One Day at a Time,\\" and \\"Lucy in the Sky With Diamonds.\\"<br />I was digging through my old albums and found I had the original album.  The detailed artwork is amazing.  There also was a lyric booklet as well as a Captain Fantasic poster.  While I like CD's, you tend to miss out on this sort of stuff due to size constraints.  It's really pretty cool.<br />If I were to limit myself to only one Elton John album that I felt was representative of his career, this is the album I'd get.
B0000DD7LB|3.0|How can someone who has no vocal talent at all keep making cds that everyone is dying to buy?? I did not buy this cd, i listened to my friend's copy. Most of the songs would be great, if there was no singing. I think i liked &quot;Outrageous&quot; the best cause the beat so awesome and it drowned out her horrible voice. When track 10 came up, I couldn't handle it...it was almost worse then that not a girl not a woman song. The only place this cd should be played is in a club with the base turned up real loud.
B0000DD7NL|5.0|This CD is one of the best CD's I have ever listened to. It's up there with Mary's My Life (which is my favorite). Alica Keys really did her thing on this CD. She is so talented. Tracks 6 &amp; 11 are exceptionally moving. I can't listen to anything else. I know almost every song, and it just came out Tuesday. Songs in A Minor is a Classic but this is more than that.....It's a MOVEMENT......  LOL....Go and get this Album ASAP
B000002UAU|4.0|Loved the Beatles all my life (and I'm 50), but it's long overdue to put &quot;Sgt. Pepper&quot; into perspective.  No question that when it was released in '67, there was nothing else like it from any popular artist around (meaning the 13th Floor Elevators who maybe 13 people heard of don't count.) Since getting high (weed and acid) was just becoming popular with college kids and even down into high school, it was the first POPULAR music that sounded even better when high. Listening to music with headphones was also just starting to catch on, and because this was the first POPULAR record that had such unique production (such as the farm animal sounds following &quot;Good Morning Good Morning&quot;) it sounded even greater on headphones.   I know, old hat now, but again the first popular headphone album.  What about the production from today's perspective?  Bob Dylan says that he didn't like Sgt. Pepper when it first came out, because even though &quot;it had some good songs, the overproduction ruined it.&quot;  Didn't agree back then, today I do.  They talk of &quot;Let it Be Naked&quot; as stripped down, I wouldn't mind hearing some of these tracks on Pepper stripped down.  Not all these songs hold up 35+ years later. The best, of course, is &quot;A Day in the Life&quot; which is still maybe one of the top 3 Lennon-McCartney collaborations ever. And listening to &quot;Good Morning&quot; on the Anthology CD without the backing vocals and everything sounds much better as a song than the Pepper version.  &quot;Strawberry Fields Forever&quot; and &quot;I Am the Walrus&quot; should have both been included here to have made it a stronger album, while &quot;Benefit of Mr. Kite,&quot; and sorry George &quot;Within You Without You&quot; could have been scrapped. (Always thought that &quot;All Too Much&quot;, &quot;The Inner Light&quot; and &quot;Old Brown Shoe&quot; were better George Harrison tracks that were never included on major Beatle releases.)  I guess the psychedelic feel dates the album today (Dylan never put out a psychedelic album) to the same extent as &quot;Satanic Majesties Request&quot; sounds dated today.  And it's too bad because there are some great songs here, which may have been better recorded by the Beatles in 1969 instead of 1967.  I guess I just feel that the White Album and Rubber Soul are the two best albums that hold up today, and Sgt. Pepper (while revolutionary at the time) doesn't quite cut it today.
B0000DD7NL|5.0|ALICIA IS HOTT!!I cant say enough about this CD.  The first time i listend to it, it didnt really hit me.  Once I actually sat and gave it a good listen, this is a damn good CD, now I cant seem to get enough of it.  The best songs on here to me are Karma, Heartburn(The beat is tight), You Don't Know My Name, If I Aint Got You, Diary f/ Toni Tony Tone, Dragon Days, If I Were Your Woman/Walk On By....well you get my drift...I pretty much like the whole CD.  So my suggestion to you is to buy the CD, put it in the Cd player and just do yo thang to it (whatever that may be)....SO ALICIA KEYS DID IT AGAIN!!
B0000DD7NL|5.0|I LOVE THIS CD, ALICIA IS ONLY 22, IMAGINE WHAT SHE WILL SOUND LIKE 10 YEARS FROM NOW.. ALICIA IS TOTALLY PHENOMENOL!!!
B0000AI45P|2.0|Some of the guitar playing is okay, and there's a decent melody here and there, but basically this band gets lots of critics acclaim because they never had mainstream success. Sometimes the mainstream has the wrong idea, and sometimes the right. The bands from this era and &quot;scene&quot; that made it big were all better than Television. This is an incredibly mediocre record, and that's all there is to it. It's big with the name dropping hipster types because they can say, &quot;oh, you know about Blondie, but TELEVISION was really the best band from the CBGB era/scene!!!&quot;. BULLOCKS!!! Clean out your ears and stop being so pretentious.
B00005Y7AW|5.0|How much do I love this CD? Let me count the ways. I have two Poses CDs at any given moment, one that will never leave the house and one for lending and traveling. And when the loaned CD cannot be wrested back, I buy another for lending, because it must be shared.<BR>     Yes, I love the lush orchestrations, original and inventive. Yes, I love the haunting melodies, starting deceptively simple. I'm no music theorist, but Rufus knows his stuff. He creates chord progressions that give me goose bumps. The mood of a song can turn on a dime, on a single perfect note. The melodies build and release. (Oh, I've had a revelation! His songs are like that, I won't spell it out but think about it.) There is a majestic elegance to the CD as a whole that never fails to transport me. Headphones are recommended to savor every luscious drop.<BR>     His lyrics possess honesty and craftsmanship that are a beautiful thing all by themselves.<BR>     But that VOICE, oh my god! No, it isn't crystal clear, but because it quakes and rasps and even catches, what emotion that voice evokes! When that voice wants to convey deep ache tempered with hope and fierce determination, I am reduced to a puddle. There, I admit it, I am moved to tears by this CD. I don't know if because of the glorious construction of the music, or by lyrics so revealing, or an empathy and consolation of his yearnings that perhaps we all share. Who gives a hoot if he's gay? These emotions are universal to the human condition.<BR>     After you own this CD for a while (and you must!), and muster the audacity to sing along, you will realize and appreciate how the phrasing, words, and even single syllables so artfully and lovingly wrap the notes.<BR>     In case you think I'm just gaga over the guy and blind to imperfection, the very last, trailing notes of Tower of Learning (my personal favorite) seem to cut off before the fourth beat rather than after. There! My review is balanced, but I swear, it's the only flaw.<BR>Rufus knows it's a crazy and often cruel world. I hope he attains the success he deserves, but if the music career flops he can come live at my house forever. (I have a piano!) It is our good fortune that the same world has such a wonder in it.
076790592X|5.0|This book is very inspirational, and should draw a tear or two to your eyes.  Morrie Schwartz, who has the &quot;luxury&quot; of knowing approximately when he will die, uses his remaining time to impart much of his wisdom to one of his favorite old college students.  He teaches us what most of us should already know, be must be reminded of anyway - that our relationship with our fellow man is infinitely more important than what else we do in our hectic lives.  <br />But what really made me sad was Morrie is only half right.  Our relationships are the key - but it isn't only our relationship with our fellow man which is important, but also our relationship with our creator.  He put us here for a reason.  We are here for His glory.  <br />I highly recommend this book for all to read.
0451163516|4.0|This was my first Ken Follet book, and I couldn't have been more pleased!  Follet brilliantly takes the reader back to the pre-World War I/Russian Revolution era in a vivid, yet easy-to-read style.  The plot is fast moving and keeps the reader engaged throughout.  Follet's only shortfall, from my standpoint, came in his effort to make \\"the man from St. Petersburg\\" himself somewhat sympathetic.  But overall, this is a good thriller, set in an era which Follet masterfully brings to life.
B0000DZEA1|5.0|Waiting to listen to the Return of the King was like waiting to go to the dentist. I couldn't wait to get it over with, but at the same time i just hoped and prayed it was going to be satisying. The first two scores - especially the first one - really did show how the art of film scoring exceeds beyong any other art. The first score was fantastic, the second a rather heavily influenced score from the previous, but the third was quite a suprising one. <br />What made me go &quot;umm...&quot; was the use of themes that Score embedded into the score. He uses the main themes that he set up before sparingly and rarely uses the Rohan theme at all (but that's only on the album, the film might show otherwise)which was quite suprising. Shore uses these themes and emulates them in different forms. For example he uses the main hobbit hymn in a slightly different arrangement - not bad, but maybe a little too experimental for this score. The themes he sets up for the film alone are quite amazing. The battle themes though are simply amazing, the best i've heard as of late. Shore manages to weave in and out subtle hints of themes in the battle scenes which in turn make the tracks very dramatic. He is able to use the orchestra and the brass especially to really brutalise the battle sequences which is something i haven't heard since GLADIATOR by Hans Zimmer. <BR>Shore really does manage to get your heart pounding whilst listening to the score. The track SHELOB'S LAIR is a stunner and by the looks of it, the scene in the film is going to be one hell of a showstopper - and that's just listening to the background music! <BR>I was very impressed with the score as a whole and i am glad that Shore finishes off in style. As a score alone, it excels and i would strongly recommend it for this Christmas. When comparing this to the other two, i felt it was slightly better than the TWO TOWERS because Shore has tied up all the loose bits of string beautifully. In regards to the first score, it just simply doesn't hit the mark. The FELLOWSHIP was a fantastic score and it will remain a fantastic one, but i felt that RETURN OF THE KING wasn't as good as the FELLOWSHIP. Shore has made a decent attempt at outdoing the first one but i felt that the first one was a stunner. <BR>I was suprised yet glad at this score. It wasn't a score i was expecting which, in a way, distinguishes this one from the other previous scores, but i was happy with it. It's a great listen and after hearing Annie Lenox's song you'll be dying to see the movie!<BR>    I strongly recommend this score to you.
B0000042H4|5.0|This CD set is the finest recording one might find of Wagner's whole ring series.  The forging scene from Siegfried rivals the live one that I recently witnessed at the Lyric Opera of Chicago, as the hammer is more artfully, and subsequently, more powerfully pounded.  This CD set captures the pawky and peerless power of Wagner's work superbly. BRAVO.
B00006BTCA|3.0|NYC is a great song.  Hands Away excellent song.  However, after awhile this album starts to sound the same, and the limitations of the players start to show through.  The guitarists are very limited and pretty much play the same thing on every song.  The vocalist is also pretty limited and can sound tuneless at times.  Also, the album is so over-compressed that there are literally no dynamics and it gives you a headache when played at any volume.  Terrible &quot;make it as loud as possible&quot; mastering job.   Listen to the quiet parts and the loud parts.  There is little or no difference in volume.  &quot;Radio friendly.&quot;  Is Interpol ever really going to be huge with middle America?  Probably not.  So why master it like a Linkin Park CD?  I wish I could get my hands on a pre-mastered version, then maybe I'd give the album 4 stars.  <br />That being said, Interpol are a good band and I look forward to their next album and hope they expand a bit on what they've done here so they can kill the Joy Division comparisons.  Oh, and the first single off the album was a direct rip off of The Smiths &quot;This Charming Man.&quot;  Hey, they could have ripped off worse.
B00005JMF6|3.0|Ok, saw this flick Tuesday night.  I was not overly impressed with it.  It had a slow start, but then when it was off and running it went by pretty quick, then it dragged ass again.  Halle Berry is a shrink who, evidentally, works with prisoners.  She gets into a car wreck because she sees this girl in the middle of the road.  Next thing she knows she is waking up and her husband has been murdered.  Chopped to pieces.  Guess who the only suspect is.... of course, her.  Predictable, right?<br />See that was the problem with this movie.  I want a movie to leave me wondering and then show me before I have time to figure it out.  <br />Now, as far as mystery quality, this movie was not so great, obviously.  As far as horror quality.... it has a few pretty good \\"gotcha\\" moments... nothing I would recommend any award nominations for.  My advice:  If you wanna see the movie, go ahead.  I can't say I was completely unsatisfied.  Personally, if I had it to do over, I would still watch it... but after it came out on video.<br />Overall score:  C+
B0000DZEE3|4.0|I got this DVD today and watched it. It exceeded my expectations. The Peppers have truley become legendary !  This dvd ROCKS.<BR>peace...
B00006CXXU|5.0|Christina Aguilera is one of the most talented artist out there today. Unlike many other artist, Brittany Spears, Jessica Simpson and many other female singers, Christina can &quot;really&quot; sing. Not only does she stand above many but she brings her own fashsion syle and soul to her fans.<br />If Christina is one of the best then why does she recieve so much negative critizism from the media and even from many artist. When Christina was fist presented to the public she was a little sixteen year old,blone haired, blue eyed, tiny bopper who could do no wrong. Now that Christina has grown and developed her own sense of style why is she being critized.<br />Christina changeing her appearance was no difference from Brittany Spears changing her apperance back in 2000. Brittany changed her style to bigger bearst and less clothes. Her music stayed the same; her songs were still full of nothing,and still are.<br />When Christina changed her syle she also changed the way she presented herself. She started to sing about things that really matter which &quot;Genie in a Bottle&quot; didn't. She started to sing about love, life, pain and many other meaningful things that should not be other looked.<br />Even though Christina Aguilera has stripped off her clothing doesn't mean that her music has suffered. She is one of the best out there. She has her own opinion, style and soul, that's why I love her.
B0000CD5I6|5.0|Jethro Tull's Christmas Album is as fresh and exciting as all their other recordings.  I loved both their new songs and new interpretations of classic carols, all in the distinctive style of Ian Anderson.  They are very joyous, as the season should be.<br />You'll want to play this one all year long!
B000002H97|5.0|This is one of the greatest albums I have ever heard.<BR>From the awsome vocals and music in Enter Sandman right through to the Struggle within every track is as good as the one before it. Lars Ulrich's drumming through out the whole album is magnificent and James Hetfields singing just plain rocks!<BR>I recomend to buy this album ahead of any other albums you had in mind.
6305128952|3.0|I'm a sucker for a Robert Redford film and after watching the Horse Whisperer I cannot think of any other actor who could have played the lead role better.  <br />The film starts off innocently enough with two young girls Judith and Grace (played by excellent new actreess Scarlett Johansson) taking a horseback ride in the snow.  There's a terrible accident in which Judith dies, Grace is crippled and Grace's horse is injured.  The tragedy destroys both the horse's and Grace's trust and self-esteem.   <br />Grace's mother, a busy magazine editor, eventually decides to take her daughter and horse to Tom Booker, the Horse Whisperer (Redford), in Montana.  Tom's reluctant to help out but eventually gives in.  Over time and away from the bustle of the big city the family starts to heal.  Additonally, grace's mother gains a new perspective on life from Tom and ends up falling in love with him.<br />Despite being a long film it doesn't really get into the details of what horse whispering is, explain the troubled relationship between mother and father, or devle into why Tom falls in love with the mother (what was so great about her?)  The film however does have some fine acting and a very peaceful feel to it.  Recommend watching it after a hard days work, at the cabin, or on a lazy Sunday afternoon.
B00005JM0B|1.0|I am super fan of Terminator and Terminator II but when I watched Terminator III, I was super disappointed. No wonder James Cameron did not participated in this movie.<br />There are few things that were just too hard to bare. 1) Even Arnold hit the gym for this movie, you can totally tell he was an old man. He was sucking up his tommy. 2)Did anybody thought &quot;Talk to the Hand&quot; funny? Not me. 3) Is it just me or does anybody else think that John Conner looked like a monkey?...the list goes on.<br />If I were you, I will just rent this movie and return it.
B00005JKED|3.0|Well, some police action with a twisted Cop as the main bad guy inter forcing with a young Detective wannabe, somewhere between a Gangster story and a Police Urban flick. Training Day is about the thin line between the good protocol deed and the confusing brutal police methods in the every day patrolling Black and Latin ghettos, either you are the victim or the aggressor, and so the young trainee (Ethan Hawk), has a full day to learn the ways of brutality, a one in a life time shot to become a Wolf among Wolves, but is all about mind games. <BR>Training Day greatest quality relies on its two main characters; the story is constructed upon an ambiguous Police detective (Alonzo Harris), famously known by his unorthodox techniques, most meticulously malignant and disguised as effectively direct, masterfully planning the only one move that can saves his a..., Densel Washington does a wonderful and strong profile of this corrupted police man, both cruel and wise (this is the one role that is away from those alike idealistic and moral characters Denzel is used to portrait), his always imposing presence and sharp skills are a perfect match for the character, and Denzel expresses every glimpse and  words with a percuasive and frightening tone, the exact requiremend for this role that has the whole movie in his backs. Ethan Hawk does an equally fine job as the young but smart Rookie, not a supportive role but a main one (Denzel won the 2002 Academy Award for this performance, and Ethan Hawk was nominated for Best Supporting role). The film goes strong and intensive until the end, where it should have ended when the Rookie catches Alonzo at his lovers apartment, but Alonzo's death is to much stretched out and turn both silly and un-believable, slowing the pace and breaking all the roughness of the concept, a very unfortunately decision that turns Training Day in another movie with a good beginning and a bad ending. If the decision was taken because of the Studio feeling that the story needed to enhanced the ending by making it more unexpected (they thought), or because Washington put hand to save some of his more histrionic moments, it doesn't mattered (neither the alternated ending), because, this was decided to be the definitive Cut (that's why the other ending is labeled as Alternated), and so all the carefully constructed psychological atmosphere of Aggressive against the righteous public, falls down heavily, and you no longer feel seduced by the plot (maybe I am wrong, and this was the director's idea). Another thing is that the Alonzo character needed some more ambiguity as the story develops, but that's a little something. <BR>Antoine Fuqua sustains his good direction towards the ending, where it falls down by   the oppression of whatever situation with the Big shots, (remember, most Producers and Studio Executive, are nothing more than Bankers), no Pink Wallet saved the situation, and so Alonzo Harris falls by his own WEIGHT, for all the bad deeds he made, at the end they felt heavily on his shoulders, gravity is something terrible. <BR>A very smart blend between the original score and the songs (mostly Gangster's Rap), fulfills the action and still moments. Nice photography and perfect settings locations does some more goods for the film. What ever the film is a realistic portrait of Police Corruption or a blown up idea of the Truth because of its action possibilities and appealing, well only an L.A. Cop knows for sure, but the film is close enough to the real thing with some commercial inserts in it, but it can't be taken as a lesson or as an important film in that matter, nothing more than a nice action movie with something more to it.
B00005JLT5|1.0|I honestly couldn't be more bored or annoyed by this movie. It depicts the life and conditions of a Jewish family during the Nazi occupation of Poland during WWII, and probably does a very good job of showing what conditions were like, and the horror and suffering inflicted on the Jewish people, but it just isn't entertainment! There comes a point in the movie - about half way through - when you realise that nothing is actually going to happen. It almost seems as though only half a script was written and the rest of the movie needs to be filled in with a haggard looking pianist staring out of various windows. Yes, I know that the intention was to make the viewer feel the tedium and claustrophobic conditions that the pianist was enduring, but it just isn't interesting! I don't really think that the life story of...I can't actually remember his name so you see how much impact this movie had on me...was actually worth making a movie about in the first place! This was just an overindulgence of the part of some writer and director, and such a shallow movie with underdeveloped characters, not to mention the apathy! This film only really showed me three things about the nature of people. (1) Everyone in this movie cares for nothing other than himself - even the pianist who seems to care little for the fate of his family as long as he is OK. Everyone is on the take - even the \\"nice\\" guy who is supposed to be collecting for the pianist is creaming off the money and letting the pianist get sick - is there noone in this movie with any human decency? (2) The Jews simply allowed their fate to happen to them without so much as an attempt to fight back until it was all too late. Those thousands of Jews in Warsaw could have made a real problem for the Nazis if they had just had the backbone to do something about it! (Again, I'm not saying they don't - this is the message I am getting from this movie). There are so many hints that they are going to fight back, but the vast majorityend in apathy! (3) All Germans are evil. By the time we have witnessed the many horrendous acts of cruelty we see so many of the Germans comitting, the one German who is supposed to redeem the others at the end of the film, just doesn't have any significance. Also, as ALL the Germans are portrayed as evil and brutal, the kindness of the German officer who brings the pianist food is now way out of character. I am aware of the brutality committed by the Nazis, but the overindulgence in brutality this film portrays can have but one goal - to pit people against the Germans! Do we really need to dredge up all that hatred again and again as the world is supposedly becoming a closer community? I think not! If you want to be bored, depressed and feel very negative about humankind, then this is the movie for you! If you want to be entertained, then go and watch the Star Wars collection!
B0000028P8|1.0|People, stop with this Mariah Carey is the best singer to grace the earth malarki! When she sings, it is not pleasant to me. For each his own I guess, but when you have artists like Celine Dion, Whitney Houston, and Martina McBride out there, what possesses you to get all excited about Mariah and say she's the best singer in the world? I mean, Christina Aguilera can sing Mariah Carey under the table any day of the week. Could she not? Mariah's studio music is bad... and her live \\"unplugged\\" bunk is too. A friend of mind gave me this CD so I didn't waste any money on it. And it's not a music CD anymore, it's a nice coaster on which I sit my Celine Dion coffee mug. The fact of the matter is that Celine undoubtedly is the best vocalist out there, and to even mention Mariah Carey in the same manner is just ridiculous. If you want a live CD that won't make you bleed at the ears, I suggest any of Celine Dion's three live CDs. Get real, people.
B0000DJZA5|5.0|[...]The running order of \\"Let It Be... Naked\\" is very similar to the scrapped version.  I remember two of Paul's songs, \\"Teddy Boy\\" and \\"Junk,\\" were supposed to be on the original LP.    [...]The release of \\"Let It Be... Naked\\" is a logical step in providing fans with the album which Lennon threatened would show the group with its trousers down.  No need to worry, trousers down or up, the Beatles are the greatest, most creative band rock music ever produced!
1573301183|5.0|From the trenches of deaf-rendering metal comes a counter-acoustic set from short-lived, but eternal rock legends Alice In Chains. Beginning in an dreary, almost supernatural candle-lit room (all too symbolic of their music), the gentle acoustics of 'Nutshell' carry you in a head hanging trance as a reassuring introduction to possibly one of the greatest rock performances ever caught on film. Throughout the performance the ominous, crow-like presence of Layne Staley looms like a haunting manifestation of human decay, which by being succumbed to, you learn a greater appreciation for his music. Jerry Cantrell (leeched by a joint) manipulates his guitar as it near possesses the stage as a third voice accompanying himself and Staley. The broken down version of 'Sludge Factory' is a highlight in itself, as it then leads into 'Down in A Hole' the way it was meant to be played. The vocal duo's between Staley and Cantrell are perhaps the most alluring part of the entire performance, as the sounds of hope and the hopeless blend for a perfect mesh of rock-genre voice. In all, Alice In Chains becomes the epitome of what great rock music is.
B0000C6E4D|5.0|Ok, So it's Sarah and Surfacing (in many ways all over again), BUT what's wrong with that?  It's nice to hear an artist perfect something that obviously caught our attention the first time.  Kudos for refining a sound that works and adding something without - by the way - spoiling the recipe.
B00004X0Q0|5.0|While the band may have broken up shortly after this release, it still stands the test of time as At The Drive In's most successful and, quite possibly, most realized release. We all had heard young kids grinding their voice over distortion by the year 2000; it would take a phenomenal talent to not only reinvent this tired out wheel, but to bring about a respectability and new way to look at music that hadn't been seen perhaps since the early 90s. At The Drive In, however, does both; they combine the best of thier influences- the theatrics of the emo/hardcore bands, the textured artistry of Rage Against The Machine, and the stream-of-consciousness introspection of Dylan- to not only recreate the wheel, but an upgrade to the engine, as well.<br />The album opens with \\"Arcarsnal\\", a rip-roaring sonic opener that serves as a flood-gate for the rest of the album. In it's short three-minute duration, we're treated to more vocal gymnastics, intense drumming, strong foundations and anarchic energy then you can shake a stick at. Right from the get-go ATDI's sheer passion is made very clear.<br />Hot on it's heel's follows \\"Pattern Against User\\", a hypnotizing mesh of upbeat mantra and a one-two punch of a breakdown that shows off the true range of lead singer Cedric Bixler's unparalleled vocals, proving he can emote melodically as he can with his cawing.<br />Next up is \\"One Armed Scissor\\", the notorious single that single-handedly sent this album straight into the ears of countless music-lovers (ATDI even had U2's Bono as a fan at one point, if you can believe that) and up countless charts. It's epic, it's complex, it's got an amazing vocal breakdown, but most importantly, it contains an energy and saliva-dripping power that hasn't been so universally felt since Cobain roamed the earth.<br />There's a short, soft piano interlude at the end of this, complete with clocks ticking and glass breaking, that is quickly interrupted by the explosion of \\"Sleepwalk Capsules\\", another nightmare-ish rocker of eccentric rambling that breaks down into a eerie walk through reverberating guitars and a repeated pusedo-religious barking.<br />\\"Sleepwalk Capsules\\" completes the straight through rockers at the front of the album, and in it's wake is \\"Invalid Litter Dept.\\", a masterstroke of layered guitars, podium ranting that Bob Dylan would be proud of, and a sturdy, strong chorus to wrap it up into one strong, epic package. The piano bridge near the end of the song only helps to accent the beauty of this song.<br />Bouncing up next is the decidingly Rage Against The Machineness of \\"Mannequin Republic\\", a dark, decadent mesh of thick bass and heavy distortion with paranoid, precise drumming that adds an amazing sense of urgency to the track's feedback heavy punch. It's a close contender with the nosiest track on the album, but with the sheer thrill that's already been set by this album, it's perfectly welcomed.<br />Opening with a phone call between a voice-box and a weary mother, \\"Enfilade\\" is one of the most memorable tracks, taking textured rock to a whole new level as accordions, latin clapping, bongos, and hurried synth drums line the track's wet, rainy atmosphere. That atmosphere is owed largely to the lead singer's voice being ran through either a voice modulator or a guitar pedal, or whatever little trick they had up their sleeve.<br />Right up next is quite possibly the silliest, and yet most amazing and invigorating rock song on the album, \\"Rolodex Proaganda\\". With contributing vocals from, of all people, Iggy Pop, \\"Rolodex Proaganda\\" rocks out only like ATDI could- they squeak and sing in operatic voices and scream at intervals as random as their lyrics, yet some how manage to not only make it work, but make it one of their finest moments.<br />With rain drizzling at the beginning of the track, along with a thick, competent bass and bright guitars that could easily be mistaken for the soft thunder in the background, \\"Quarantined\\" might be abit slower then some of the tracks, but more then makes up for it with it's beautiful arrangements and confident vocals that attribute as much spirituality as it does ambiguity. The bridge of this song is one of the band's creative peaks, and yet another high point on this album.<br />Reuniting us with the fast paced rambling and erratic guitar crunch that opened Relationship of Command, \\"Cosmonauts\\" is one last blast of typical ATDI rock to peak interest and show off that `s patent ramblescream could make anything sound urgent and alarming.<br />Closing out the album is \\"Non-Zero Possibility\\", a supernatural, haunting, mournful melody driven by piano and Bixler`s gothic chorus. Perhaps the slowest track on the album, it's also the most complex and by far the most beautiful, closing out Relationship of Command, oddly enough, just as it began- with an untouchable, unidentifiable energy and prowess of human emotion and atmosphere that may not make much sense, but still manages to move and fascinate in ways never felt before.<br />While perhaps this was also the album that made the band implode shortly thereafter it's out-of-nowhere success, one could almost draw a line from the electric amount of atmosphere and experimentation to perhaps possible bickering as to what direction ATDI should head in. This is entirely possible, since the members split into two very different bands- drummer, bassist, and guitarist went to Sparta, which recounts ATDI's more classic true-to-form emo-head-bang side, while lead singer and guitarist bounded off to Mars Volta, which is certainly more experimental and texturized then either ATDI or Sparta. (and, incidentally, it seems, more well received)<br />No matter what directions or side projects they take (and how ever much success they achieve with them) ATDI's \\"Relationship of Command\\" will stand as the album that launched them into the world's faces and as one of the strongest albums of a new generation of music and mayhem. Whether or not it will be these members's opus or if Sparta/Mars Volta/What-Have-You will simply look back on this album as the \\"what started it all\\" album to a historic career, time can only tell. For the mean time, though, it's the fondest memory of one of the century's newest revolutionaries.bit slower then some of the tracks, but more then makes up for it with it's beautiful arrangements and confident vocals that attribute as much spirituality as it does ambiguity.

B0000DD7NL|2.0|Compared to her first album and all the time off that Alicia took to be able to sit back and watch these bubble gum, naked girls with no vocal skills...well let's just say I have been waiting and hoping this album would blow them out of the water!  You Don't Know My Name got me like whoa!!!!!!!!!!!!! &amp; kept in anticipation for the other songs. When listening to this album I was not really impressed.  Slow Down &amp; When U Really Love Someone are a couple of songs that people might be like that is nice.  If you are a fan just due to Alicia's piano skills just know that everything she plays on this album is sampled (not original) and the beats sound the same as her last album.  Thank goodness I listned to my sisters advice and just copied the whole album from her CD.  She gets 2 stars for 1 asounding song (U Don't Know My Name) &amp; u can pick the other.  These other songs just did not catch my attention.
B00005JMFO|4.0|Well, as a man who was dragged to this film by my girlfriend  on the same day we saw Kill Bill, I hate that I actually liked it more than the latter.  Men are supposed to take blood and violence over smooching middle-aged paradigms, not  have our sensitive sides manipulated by touching storylines. I have let down my forefathers!  Reluctantly I admit that the film is incredibly good, and any man who doesn't walk away with a somewhat renewed sense of hope for relationships and love is a very bitter man indeed.  <br />The movie focuses on a series of relationships in various stages of growth, with the majority of them in infant stages --the exceptions would be Emma Thompson and Alan Rickman's marriage and Liam Neeson's struggle with widowhood (that's not a spoiler, the movie opens with it) Some are more prominant than others, and while I expected that each would in someway be related to the other, some of them, in a very unconvetional way, stood alone. A few of them could have been cut out as they are a bit underdeveloped, but all of them are worth following and are very charming. (Just dropped another rung on the masculinaty ladder with that statement.)<br />Ther'se been some hype about the nudity in the film. As a man, ha ha, I had no problem with it. But, in terms of gratuity, I think it serves its purpose, because these are poeple dealing with lust as much as love. There are some scenes where two film stand-in charatcers are asked to engage in faux sexual activity in the nude, but when you include it in the film's premise of how some people meet, it works as an amusing adult situation, not porn. It's funny, it's quirky, if you're offended then you're probably not getting the joke.<br />Anyway, my final comment is to add that Liam Neeson's father/son story is worth seeing this movie for alone. I found myself routing for this little boy the way i route for the Red Sox.
B000002UCN|3.0|Casual George fans really don't have it good. 'The Best of Dark Horse' is out of print, and this is the only compilation to cover his years on Apple. But of the 13 tracks on this album, over half are performed by the Beatles, not by George as a solo artist. You've got two from 'Abbey Road,' &quot;Something&quot; and &quot;Here Comes the Sun&quot;; two from 'Rubber Soul,' &quot;If I Needed Someone&quot; and &quot;Think for Yourself&quot;; and one each from the White Album, 'Revolver,' and 'Let it Be'. It would be a travesty if &quot;Here Comes the Sun,&quot; &quot;Something,&quot; and &quot;Taxman&quot; were missing from such a collection--as fortunately they are not--but it's almost as bad that &quot;I Need You&quot; and &quot;Within You and Without You&quot; are missing. That is to say, this isn't even an adequate best-of-Beatle-George collection. Not that there should really be *any* Beatles tracks on an album by this title.<br />To the proper solo George tracks, we're given two from ATMP, &quot;My Sweet Lord&quot; and &quot;What Is Life?&quot;; &quot;Bangla Desh&quot; from the concert album; &quot;Give Me Love&quot; from 'Living in the Material World'; and one each from 'Dark Horse' and 'Extra Texture': the title track and &quot;You,&quot; respectively. Again, setting aside the fact that 'The Best of George Harrison' only contains six solo George songs, this is somewhat disappointing. The title track from 'All Things Must Pass' is missing, which is a real shame; so is &quot;If Not For You&quot;--both are solo George classics.<br />To sum up, what is needed is a REAL best-of collection, one that spans George's entire solo career, and one which OMITS his work with the Beatles. They didn't even do that for *Ringo's* best-of album released about the same time (and it would have been very easy to replace some of his solo work with &quot;A Little Help from My Friends&quot; and &quot;Octopus's Garden&quot;).<br />George's music is stellar; this album is quite sad--so five stars for the music and one star for the album itself average to three.ve stars for the music and one star for the album itself average to three.
B0000CD5FN|3.0|I read all these reviews and I get excited then buy the CD only to be let down. I love everything the Clash ever did. I thought earthquake weather was very good. The Walker soundtrack was excellent. Loved Trash City and Love Kills. Rock Art was OK (Yalla Yalla's a great tune), I didn't like Global as much as I tried to. Same deal for streetcore. Get Down Moses is very good, the best song on the album. I thought his version of Redemption song was quite awful to be honest. I like Arms aloft and Coma girl could be a great tune but I cant get past the lyrics. The other tunes just seem to ramble lyrically and melodically and don't go anywhere. If it weren't Strummer I'd only give it 2 stars. Oh yeah- try listening to his vocal on the Blackhawk Down version of Minstrel Boy-- It'll send chills down your spine. RIP joe<br />P.S. don't bag on me for being honest..I'm just as much a fan as you are
B000002H97|4.0|The Black album isnt a bad Metallica album, its just not as good as the previous four. If you are joining the Metal Militia at this level, you missed the best stuff, but not to worry just back track and listen to the catalog in progression from Kill em All to ...And Justice for All. <br />Cliff's spirit lived on in the &quot;near-tribute&quot; album ...And Justice for All, unfortunately at the expense of the talented Jason Newstead. Lars keeps the sh*t together for Metallica at that period and you can hear his double kick drums loud and clear, sometimes too loud. This time around, the production is slick, and professional and the band was kept to a strict recording regime by producer Bob Rock. Exactly what they needed at the time in order to survive.<br />What I like about the black album is you can hear Metallica's true originality here, they arent covering Diamonhead, Mercyful Fate, Tygers of Pang Tang or Budgie on this one, its all 'tallica. Many fans were disappointed by this, they wanted to hear the same repetitive, anthemic metal, but Metallica was smarter than that. <br />Some &quot;die hard&quot; Metallica fans say that the greatest hard rock band of the 80s and 90s sold out, I say they did not. They didnt sell out to their fans who would have kept them stagnated, frustrated and without any musical challenge or direction. The black album stands right where it should.
B000002AHC|4.0|&quot;The Notorious Byrd Brothers&quot; is not the Byrds best album.  That title would surely go to &quot;Mr. Tambourine Man&quot; or &quot;Younger Than Yesterday.&quot;  It is, however, their most interesting album, and therefore the one I pop into the CD player the most.<br />With David Crosby (who is replaced with a horse's backside on the cover photo) leaving during the sessions after battling over the song Triad, which did not make the final cut, and Michael Clarke also making his exit, &quot;TNBB&quot; is the work of a band in trouble.  The final album doesn't show this so much as the high points are among the best in the Byrds catalog.  Despite leaving the band, Crosby gets to shine with the sweetly trippy &quot;Dolphin's Smile.&quot;  McGuinn has some of his best and most poignant vocals on the anti-war &quot;Draft Morning&quot; and &quot;Wasn't Born to Follow.&quot;  While most of this album is on the experimental side, the classic Byrds sound makes its final appearance on the folk rocking &quot;Goin' Back&quot; and &quot;Old John Robertson.&quot;  Of course, the band really wasn't unified enough to create another true masterpiece, and &quot;Natural Harmony,&quot; &quot;Get to You&quot; and &quot;Space Odyssey&quot; serve as little more than filler.  None of these are particularly offensive (well maybe &quot;Space Odyssey,&quot; but it's the final cut on the album and easily skipped), so they do not detract to0 much from the listening experience.<br />Of the bonus tracks, &quot;Triad&quot; is by far the keeper, as Crosby did have a point and the song should have been on the album (it would have been one of the highlights).  The Byrds' version really is superior to the Jefferson Airplane's better known, and still fine version.  There's an interesting alternate mix of &quot;Draft Morning&quot; which has some noticible changes in the war sound effects, and if you leave the disc running after &quot;Universal Mind Decoder,&quot; you'll hear hidden studio chatterof the Byrds battling in the studio.  It's rather fierce and a bit painful to hear, but illuminating in regards to the Byrds serious internal problems.<br />This is a fine disc (and the remastering remains very fine), and although I cannot give this but a four star rating, I would recommend it higher than some five-star ratings.
0380788624|4.0|Good book. Great story. Interesting writing style. Ending could've been stronger.
B00000JLWW|1.0|Only James Cameron could make such a bloated movie like \\"Titanic\\". If there is one thing I can't stand about the guy is that he makes movies in the vein of Jerry Bruckheimer and Michael Bay, lots of special effects and no plot. As much as I enjoy Kate Winslet as an actress, even she couldn't save this turkey of a movie. I have never seen so much hype and bad parodies over this atrocious mess. I only saw this movie when it was aired on NBC a couple of years ago. Needless to say, I wasted three hours of my life and I want them back. The only good scene was when Jack kicked the bucket. I was waiting for that moment to happen. Now \\"Casablanca\\" is a classic. \\"Silence of the Lambs\\" is a classic but \\"Titantic\\" is anything but a classic. This movie stands for everything I can't stand about mainstream Hollywood, big budgets, over the top special effects, bad acting, and awful scripts. Leonardo DiCaprio is not all that and a bag of chips. Billy Zane is no much better than Leo. His cartoony acting belongs in a soft porn flick, oh wait. Billy has already done soft porn. It's called \\"Lake Consequence\\". I can't believe \\"Titanic\\" made so much money on so little writing and imagination.
B000003TA4|5.0|First of all, this album is hands-down great, and anyone with a heart for music will realize its value.  Now, to say that Pearl Jam gave rise to Nirvana is ridiculous.  Pearl Jam didn't begin to pick up speed until well into Nirvana's career.  Next, to say Jane's Addiction was revolutionary is far-fetched.  Most of thier appeal came from the shock value.  Finally, this band is way more passionate than any macho, power metal.  Guns N' Roses is just commercial fluff, Megadeath's music is drowned by cheesy solos, and Zeppelin's lyrics are overrated.  If you'll recall, Mr. Plant doesn't even know what &quot;Stairway to Heaven&quot; is about.  Look, if you want an album that is rock,  passionate, and easy to relate to, Nevermind is universal, which is the way Kurt made things.
B0000C9ZLD|2.0|So I bought &quot;Room On Fire&quot; the day it came out (actually the day before; those pesky independent record stores), threw it in my car CD played, and listened.  It seemed fine and dandy, much like a continuation of &quot;Is This It?&quot; with well-written songs and Television-like guitars.  I decided I'd have to listen to it a few more times before really passing judgement.<br />But you know what?... IT'S BEEN A MONTH-AND-A-HALF AND I HAVEN'T FELT THE URGE TO LISTEN TO IT AGAIN!!  So I guess that's my final judgement; it's a pretty &quot;blah&quot; album so to speak.  I don't dislike it, I'm just really apathetic towards it.<br />The Strokes haven't failed or put out a horrible album with &quot;Room On Fire,&quot; but they've defined the term &quot;holding pattern.&quot;  If you need to feed your rock and roll mojo for 2003, I would like to direct you to Guided By Voices new disc &quot;Eathquake Glue.&quot;  It's everything that you want the Strokes to be (that goes for GBV's live act too).
B000002MI4|5.0|I am a great admirer of Elvis Costello. Like many of us, I like it better when he is with the Attractions, rocking out than when he is with Burt Bacharach getting self conscious and arty. I am also a classical musician, deeply skeptical of &quot;crossover&quot; albums. In fact, I don't think I can name one crossover album I like. Except this one. And I love it. I think this record has several of Costello's best lyrics AND melodies. &quot;Taking my life in your hands&quot; would make Lennon, McCartney, and Mahler all equally proud. It defies genre and comes scarily close to what I am tempted to call &quot;pure expression.&quot; Of course, that's a ridiculous notion, but this song is such an emotional and aesthetic slam dunk that I am awed. Also I love &quot;Damnation's Cellar&quot; and &quot;Who do you think you are?&quot; There are some duds here, and I'd have to say the first two tracks will scare a lot of people off. Hang in there. It was a year or two after this album was released that I learned to love it, and time after time, it holds up better for me than any other Costello release.
B0000DJZA5|1.0|LIBN is an album that only a hopelessly nostalgic baby boomer could love. But if you weren't born between 1946-1961 and/or you've retained your critical faculties, AVOID THIS MONEY-GENERATING PRODUCT. <br />&quot;Let It Be&quot; is average by Beatles standards; &quot;Let It Be...Naked&quot; is awful by musical standards. These stripped-down versions of songs you already know reveal what the Beatles had become by 1969: bored and boring.

0385507755|5.0|There is plenty of drama built into both addiction and an individual's professional or personal interest in addicts.  Even though the subject has been done before, the effect of addiction on society, family and the addict is so damned monstrous not enough has yet been written or filmed or sung. The account of the addict's process of wrapping his own mind around a personal recovery philosophy was unique. Altogether, as a chronicle of addiction recovery, this book is dynamic. While including the required ugly self disclosures; the work is also entertaining on a less sensational level and in places, lovely to look at (I even enjoyed the cover). Writers and artists should provide more high quality accounts of addiction recovery.
B0000B3FCX|5.0|This band is by far one of the most solid rock groups in the music industry. The Long Road does not dissapoint. Every song (except the bonus tracks), are single material. It's good to know some bands improve cd to cd. Nickelback has mastered the rock formula and I hope they will continue to pump out great songs. This is truely a cd worth every penny.
B000024KBA|5.0|Ok, so it's more like disintigration on CD these days.  Syd Barrett's first solo album is the work of a man completely falling apart.  As the founder of Pink Floyd, Barrett ingested enough LSD to drive a medium sized country mad, and by 1968 and 1969 (when this album was recorded) his mental state was very schizophrenic.  Even with these problematic mental disorders (or maybe becasue of), Barrett managed to create a classic.<br />Following Barrett's dismissal from Pink Floyd in early 1968, the band's managers followed Barrett, assuming that the band could not survive without their creative light (oops).  While time has obviously proved them wrong, they soon set Barrett to work with producer Malcomb Jones and the trippy combo The Soft Machine to create a pop album.  Barrett's performances soon proved to be erratic and strange, and it was soon apparent that the music was not going to set the teen scene on fire.  The sessions were shelved (although temporarily as many tracks are included on the album) and &quot;Octopus&quot; was unleashed as a single.  It unsurprisingly did not go far.<br />Cut forward a few months and former bandmate Roger Waters and Syd's own replacement David Gilmore wheel Barrett back into the studio for some more fun and games.  These sessions were acoustically based, and allowed Barrett to do pretty much whatever he wanted to do, even if it was endlessly strange.<br />The final album is a somewhat daunting listen, but quite phenomenal if you can get your mind into Syd's world, where things like rhythm are rather amorphous.  &quot;No Good Trying,&quot; &quot;No Man's Land,&quot; &quot;Octopus,&quot; and &quot;Late Night&quot; are strange but amazing masterpieces of psychedelic rock.  On the first two especially, the backing musicians sound like they're furiously trying to keep up with Syd (no good trying?) and the music is always on the verge of flying apart at the seams in a wonderful and interesting sort of way.  &quot;Terrapin,&quot; &quot;Dark Globe,&quot; and &quot;Golden Hair&quot; are the more acoustic classics.<br />Now I'm guilty of a bit of blasphemous resequencing in regards to my own copy of &quot;The Madcap Laughs.&quot;  I've taken out &quot;Feel&quot; and &quot;If It's In You,&quot; which I think qualify as acoustic shambles, and replace them with &quot;Opel&quot; and &quot;Silas Lang.&quot;  These are outtakes from the Malcomb Jones sessions that I think are amazing (especially &quot;Opel&quot;) and bewilderingly left off the album.  They can be found on the otherwise hit or miss odds-and-sods complation &quot;Opel.&quot;<br />Although more expensive, I heartily recommend the EMI reissue of this disc.  The remastering is far superior to Capitol's disc, and the alternate takes are illuminating.  Barrett never played a song the same way twice; that was likely part of his madness.  Better yet, get all of Barrett's remastered studio legacy in the &quot;Shine On Crazy Diamond&quot; box set (which may be a bit difficult as I think it's out of print).rk Globe,&quot; and &quot;Golden Hair&quot; are the more acoustic classics.<br />Now I'm guilty of a bit of blasphemous resequencing in regards to my own copy of &quot;The Madcap Laughs.&quot;  I've taken out &quot;Feel&quot; and &quot;If It's In You,&quot; which I think qualify as acoustic shambles, and replace them with &quot;Opel&quot; and &quot;Silas Lang.&quot;  These are outtakes from the Malcomb Jones sessions that I think are amazing (especially &quot;Opel&quot;) and bewilderingly left off the album.

B00009TB5G|5.0|This version, in my opinion, was better than the theatrical version. It stays closer to the book and has more depth and drama. If you only like the movies because of the ultra cool action sequences than you might want to stay away because most of the new scenes are just a bunch of talking.<br />There is just one thing i dont understand. The scene where they are burying Theodin's son is kind of cut off on my dvd. I dont know if its like this with all of them but on my dvd it goes from Eowyn singing and the people puttin Theodrid in his tomb to Theodin holding a flower in front of the closed tomb. The scene ends very abruptly and i just simply want to know if all the dvds are like that or if mine is just messed up.
B000099T2L|5.0|Personally, I'd been getting a little tired of Beyoncemania. I hadn't any intentions on buying this cd. Not because I think she has a lack of talent, because she doesn't, but because I thought it was going to be basically be every Destiny's Child Cd mixed up in a blender and poured out. Then one night I was at my friend's house listening to it. I was pleasantly shocked to hear how good it was. That next morning, I was in line at Target buying it. And that was months ago. I listen to it almost every day. The highlights of this CD are Speechless, Dangerously In Love and Naughty Girl.<br />If you haven't bought this CD yet, stop reading now and go out and get it!
B00009TB5G|5.0|OK, as almost everyone else has said, this version blows the theatrical version away. Critical is:<br />-MUCH subtext to Faramir's behavior. His behavior was completely non-sensical (if you are a fan of the books) in the theatrical release, but this version makes a lot more sense.<br />-LOTS of special additions that make the Merry/Pippin/Treebeard/ents scenes MUCH more satisfying<br />-the inexplicable Wargs scene is still there, but it seems diminished in importance in light of the other additions<br />You must pick this up. YOU MUST PICK THIS UP!<br />One note: I haven't read all 1500-plus reviews here, but I wonder if anyone picked up on the brief homage to the book's Tom Bombadil/Old Man Willow scenes that Jackson could not include in Fellowship of the Ring. Look and listen again to the added ent-draught scene!
0312305060|1.0|I started to read this book with great expectations. It received many good reviews and was a best seller. the first few pages were fine. The story seemed to be heading somewhere. But as i continued reading the story became much too boring and pointless. What is the bottom line of the story? I feel that reading this book was nothing but a waste of time. It is the worst book i've read in years.<BR>Do yourself a favour-don't read it!
B0000A36J5|3.0|Ive been reading a lot of people's reviews and they say that disks 3 and 4 won't work on their dvd player. I have an Apex dvd player and the disks both play fine. Is this problem with all of the dvds or just the ones of the people complaining? Does New Line even know their dvds are messed up? I mean... i dont want a dvd that won't play on others. I plan on getting other dvd players in the future. Nobody wants a defective disk.<BR>When will it be fixed???
B00005JMJ4|5.0|This movie was magical.  Most movies show the story, but this film is made in such a manor that you feel the story.  The confusion of being in a land where people don't speak or write your language, where the culture and customs are strange, and being thousands of miles away from your family would make anyone grab on to anything familiar, which is what Bill Murray's character does.  He finds an American girl who is struggling with the same issues, and they find sanity in each other.<br />The way this movie is written and filmed makes you live the experience with the characters instead of just seeing it happen to them.  Brilliantly done.
B00008PW2D|5.0|And my boyfriend is buying this DVD for me as soon as it comes out, though I will tell him to buy it online where the price is cheaper.  First of all, one person said that the other seasons were entitled to be priced so high because they all had 18 episodes -- but that person clearly has no idea what they're talking about because the first season, priced exactly the same as the rest, had 12 episodes, but no one complained then.  If you love the series, and were willing to pay for season one, then there is no reason not to buy season five.  Soon SATC will be over forever, and you will have all your favorite episodes to look back on... and with characters who grow and change from season to season, how can you skip one?  It doesn't work.
B00007AJF9|4.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this movie, and quite frankly am at a loss when I read the negative reviews of folks upset by the historical inaccuracies. Who expects a history lesson from a Hollywood film? That's what reading is for.The point for me is, was the film an engaging and entertaining costume drama? My answer is a resounding yes. My only 'historical' problem was the insertion of the selection from the Mozart Requiem at the end of the film. Talk about a glaring anachronism!
B00005JLTN|2.0|It seems the second movie of the matrix failed in a very big way that the movie even managed to get their fans the the theater becuase of how much hype it had and all the dissapointment that comes with it, now you learned your lesson that things are not what they seem. First of all the movie fails in poorly directed fight scenes and in a complicated plot or poorly done script, In fact i was finding the movie boring to watch except the big chase scene which was probably the most exciting part of the movie, besides this the movie is just a filler between the first and third movies. <br />And its sad but true if the movie did not have special effects i'd give it 1 star.
B0000VCZK2|5.0|To the silly people who refused to acknowledge 3 and 4 WAKE UP! I didnt care for them as much either but to ban them from my collection is to throw away part of the story no matter how bad the storyline went, Its still part of the Alien story. It was the total direction that the story took that stunk. Undoing everything that James Cameron did in 2 was a discredit to him and the story.Thats really where the direction of the story went wrong. And &quot;Number 4&quot; was SIMPLY &quot;How do we save this franchise?&quot; WE SCREWED UP. So it only made perfect sense to clon her. To bring her back, after all we couldnt just place her in a shower and make it all a bad dream.&quot;Bobby Ewing in Dallas&quot;.<BR>In regards to this set though<BR>Guys Ive gotta tellya if you havent purchased this superb collection by now then do so. It has to be one of the best most comprehensive compilations Ive seen to date. The overall video quality is flawless. 2 different renditions to each movie and tons of informative material. Every cast member except 2 are in the commentaries for Alien which really brings a smile to your face when seeing them on screen and listening to their familiar and most endearing voices. Such a treat to see and hear,  it really makes you feel like part of the Alien family. Gracious as ever Sigourney delivers her signature tone to all of the detailed explanations of the film. Not to be outdone Ridley intelligient and very suave adds to this feast for the senses. Veronica beautiful as ever adds realism by showing what the artists were thinking during the different difficult segments in the film Stanton Dean adds comic relief and Tom Skerrit adding warmth and charm. Yaphet Kotto and Ian Holm were the 2 not present in this spectacular presentation. Sad but it doesnt take away from this collection. Time schedule, other commitments who knows. I havent seen the rest of my collection yet. It took one entire night just to view the first 2 discs. I already own the firstAliens set but I gotta tell you I havent seen the same footage yet. In fact more attention was given to the genius behind the monster HR Giger and proper respect was given to the superb writers of the original script. If the rest of the set is anything like the first 2, my hats off to the 20th Century people for giving us Alien diehard fans the treat of a lifetime. The only other thing that could top this is in what was mentioned at the end of Alien Commentary by Sigourney......A POSSIBLE 5TH INSTALLMENT to the story. Nothing definite but if enough of us show our commitment by purchasing this great collection and voicing our opinions the better the chances of seeing our favorite heroine in action again. Ridley mentions that a great story would be to explore the various questions that the series prompted such as the Where when and why concerning the Alien and the derelict space craft. I only have to say...well Sigourney does have a strong link to the alien species now.. so this alone would give her a purpose for a 5th installment and at the same time answer the questions raised by the story. It would only make perfect sense that her character (now a clon) would be left with tons of questions of her own. She could never be completely happy in her earthly environment until all of the questions were answered concerning the side she now shares with the Alien. The biggest question in my mind is How much of the alien is truly left inside of her.<BR>Woe I see a story unfolding........:) And lets not forget the people responsible for bringing her back as a clon. They need their come-upins too.
B00009V8Z9|5.0|I first heard of Gavin DeGraw three days before I saw the concert at House of Blues in Chicago where he was opening for Maroon 5 and I must say that after listening to a few songs online, I was completely hooked.  He did an amazing job at the concert and I was amazed that he sang, wrote his own songs, and played both guitar and piano.  He had a great personality in concert, refering to himself as the &quot;bumble bee&quot; because he was wearing a yellow and black striped scarf.  He did a cover of Marvin Gray's &quot;Let's Get It On&quot; which was simply hilarious.  As to the CD, I will listen to all of the songs and like all but two.  Chariot has amazing lyrics and Chemical Party is a fun pop song that most anyone should like.  There is not one person I can really compare him to because each of his songs has a different feel, but I'd say he's a little like John Mayer, Ben Harper, Everclear (or at least in Chemical Party), and Bruce Springsteen in I Don't Want To Be.  Overall, he is very talented and I await his next CD.
0385504209|3.0|Brown has a long way to go until he reaches the class of Eco. If you have read any of Eco's books and expect a similar nail biter, this is not it. If you have never read Eco and like historical thrillers, you will probably enjoy the book, as long as you do expect historical facts.
B0000CC5CS|4.0|the only thing that i didn't like was the length of the movie it was a bit short around 80 minutes like the first one. The third one is a great sequel to the second, unlike that matrix reloaded crap wich was one of the worst movies of 2003 in my opinion. This wasn't by far, i saw it in theaters when it first came out and the audience got a thrill and a few laughs as it was funnier than the other movies which was great idea. <br />Don't blame the movie's making on mostow, the guy did his best to come up with the 3rd installment of the franchise as there was no way cameron could do it because he was ocupied with other duties as arnold said in an intervew, so before you bash mostow why don't you try to making a movie of this capacity and try to make it work becuase its not an easy job being a director for a movie like this.<br />other good parts of the movie were the stunts, awesome stunts in that crane chase scene but i wish the movie had more stunts like in the second movie or maybe a darker tone like the first one but the bottom line is THIS IS A GOOD MOVIE, BUY IT NOW!.
B0000VAFO0|5.0|Underworld is awesome and it will make you guess whats going to happen next so if you havent seen the movie you should go rent it when it comes out it is a really bloody movie and this is not for the kids. When u first see it predict whos goin to win Vampires or werewolves.
B000089CJI|4.0|What's not to like. You got the best elements of both the 1980's synth-pop and the early 2000's post-rock. The marriage of Ben Gibbard's lyrics, voice, and guitars plus Jimmy Tamborello's electronic melodies and nibbling puts you in some kinda' musical heaven. I'd go out on a limb and say 3 spins of this disc to unsuspecting, unfamiliar will make them believers and fans. This is the most enjoyment and fun per rotation of any album this year. It holds up to scrutiny, critical acclaim, and your own personal prerogatives. You could have this CD front and center of your collection and not loose face with any hardcore friend. They'd just say\\" \\"Cool man, you got that album too\\"! The District Sleeps Alone Tonight, Recycled Air, and Natural Anthem are just three of the many terrific cuts. Like a good Boy Scout, you should be prepared because it's not often, that funny and ironic happen in the same year. These Postal Service guys exchanged ideas and recorded tracks via the US mail, building an album's worth of material as they went, thus the band name. So get your wallet out, your ears on, and throw down for Give Up.
B000000HTK|5.0|Man, if ever there was a band that earned the label &quot;acquired taste,&quot; it's VDGG. This album was my first exposure to them back in '75, and upon first listen I wasn't sure if I loved it or hated it. Thankfully, I quickly grew to love it. But it's a tough listen, to be sure. The dark lyrics, Peter Hammill's twisted vocal approach (one minute a whisper, then a moan, followed by insane screeching at the top of his lungs) and the bizarre instrumentation (think Traffic with a bad hangover). Scary stuff, but definitely worth it in the end. Practically every song on this one is a classic, especially the intense &quot;Undercover Man&quot; and &quot;Scorched Earth.&quot; Lots of great Hammond organ and sax work. My only quibble? Why, in the year 2003, has the VDGG catalog NOT been remastered yet, while some artists' CD catalogs have been remastered two, even three times over by now!? That's just downright shameful.
B00008PW2D|1.0|This DVD only has 8 episodes on it (from what I've read) and is still being sold at the regular price!!! I've been such a devoted fan and own all previous seasons...I feel like I'm being ripped off! I think I'll wait until it's in the bargain bin...from what I've heard there'll be plenty of copies.
B00008PW2D|3.0|I'm a big fan of this wonderfully acted and written show.  However, season five was a BIG disappointment.  The shorten season, due to Sarah's pregnancy, never really got going anywhere.  It is as if the writers did not want to start anything because they could not finish it in the eight epidsodes allowed. <br />Also, the girls were different in this season, as they had to be.  Each had life changing moments in season, that could not really be played out in season five.  Samatha, heartbroken from Richard, is more subdued than normal.  Miranda is adjusting to life as a mom.  Carrie is recovering from her second break up with Aiden.  Only Charolette seems to be moving forward in her life, thanks to her divorce attorney.  It would have been nice to have had a \\"bonus\\" season for season five, so that we could have a continuation of the story lines.  <br />Also, the issue with the price tag on this set is a pressing one.  Only eight episodes is going to call for only two discs.  They should not be more than $30 bucks at the most.  We'll see how well sales do, with the price tag is does have.  I think it would have been better for HBO to have released this set with Season Six.<br />Overall, I have truly enjoyed this series, and will miss it when it is gone.  Thank God for my DVD collection!
B0000025DV|5.0|This is ELO's masterpiece--a major step above everything they did before and after.  All the other records they made were good and had several excellent songs, but they all had several weak songs as well.  Although Out of the Blue is a double album, it's solid from start to finish and, in my opinion, either half of it surpasses any of their other albums--even their greatest hits package.  It has a wide range of styles and tempos, yet flows fantastically.  The songs are catchy, yet complex.  On every song, the arrangement of the band, the orchestral instruments, and the vocals is stunning.  If you want to own ELO's two best records, buy Out of the Blue.
B0000DD7LB|3.0|Like most people, I am of the belief that Britney Spears markets her rock hard abs instead of her less-than-stellar voice.  There is no reason to refute that.  For that very reason, I've never been a fan.  Actually, I can't stand her for that.  I tend to lean toward singers with real voices.<br />As this release drew closer, I got more irritated.  I didn't want to hear more cheesy pop.  But, I have been converted, at least musically, with this album thanks to my teenage sister.  Sure, it's not Grammy material, but it's decent.  The tracks are all transy and vibey with less emphasis on her voice and more on the feeling.  It works for her.  <br />Also, with this CD, she's not trying to be some sort of dichotomy: a sexual virgin.  This CD owns up to the fact that she's grown up and grown musically.  The lyrics aren't overtly sexual, but they play on sexuality which is completely appropriate for a girl of barely 22.<br />I have more respect musically for Britney with this album since she wrote most of it and worked with talented artists like R. Kelly and the Ying-Yang Twins.  It gives her more cred as an artist over just some Barbie on strings.<br />Overall, this album is fun and makes you want to dance.  It's never going to go down in history as life-changing or mind-blowing, but is serves its purpose as a fun club-ready album.  Take it from one anti-Britney supporter, this album will convert you.
B00004YW6I|5.0|My good friend Gillian Anderson introduced me to this band.  i think this is the cd i have.  Good rock and roll with an &quot;edge&quot; to it.
B0000BWVCJ|1.0|I am being generous with this 1 star. That's merely for the special effects and good opening scene.<br />However, after that it all boils down to almost 2 hours of boredom. The action is bland and all has been done before. The acting and script, if you can call it that, is so plain and painfull. The talent that is there is completely wasted on this follow up.   <br />Troma studios would've done a better job than this.<br />Not worth buying, only viewable if you are completely and utterly bored and there is nothing left on the shelves of your local video store.
B00008US8R|5.0|wow this is one of the best cd's i've ever heard! I can't believe how beautifully amy's voice and the music blend together to make songs that can't even be categorized. I'm gonna rate each song so here it goes:<BR>1. Going Under 5/5 will always be one of my favs!<BR>2. Bring Me to Life 3/5 I loved this when it first came out but it's not that great compared to others<BR>3. Everybody's Fool 3/5 very catchy<BR>4. My Immortal 5/5 so beautiful<BR>5.

Hello 3/5 this one is very haunting and dark<BR>10. My Last Breath 5/5 THIS ONE IS MY ABSOLUTE FAV!!!!!<BR>11. Whisper 4/5 nice
B0000C9ZLD|5.0|Yes they have funny names, lots of hair, sharp cheekbones, heavy new york accents &amp; a host of celebrity fans &amp; groupies (amanda de cadenat, drew barrymore, winona ryder) but boy do they make good music. &quot;Room on Fire&quot; has the same basic formula that made &quot;Is this it&quot; heavy twangy guitars over casablancas' heavily accented vocals but to a finer degree. The album really does belong to Albert Hammond Jnr &amp; Nick Valensi whose guitar solos are reminiscent of keith richards &amp; ronnie wood at their finest.Stand-out tracks are the hit single &quot;12:51&quot; &amp; the wonderfully titled &quot;Meet Me in the Bathroom&quot; &amp; &quot;You Talk Way Too Much&quot;. There is a little bit of reggae in their (Automatic Stop &amp; Between Love &amp; Hate) &amp; for all the girlies out there a fantastic ballad &quot;Under Control&quot; curtesy of the puppy-dog eyed, tortured soul that is lead singer julian casablancas. Boy into the hype.
B0000CAQ27|5.0|Pink is hands down the single most talent in the music world today.  This is a great cd.  With this new cd pink flaunts her new style!!  So buy it and Check out the emporer's new clothes!!!
B0000DD7LC|5.0|If you love her debut cd you will really love this cd. Alicia Keys The Diary of Alicia Keys is off the hook. From beginning to end this is a beautiful cd. The singing and songwriting is excellant. Love the classical piano undertones and the use of real instruments. Miss Keys even had the help of Toni Tony Ton'e, Kayne West and Timbaland. I see more Grammies in her future.
B00004X01U|5.0|Although utterly different from such past albums as Erotica, and Ray of Light, there is one similiarity. All three albums exhibits a new and improved Madonna setting a new Trend. In the Early 90's Madonna shocked us with her wild sex appeal on the album Erotica. In the Late 90's she gave us a new apperciation for a music genre, electronica, that wasnt mainstream yet in Ray of Light. Finally, with Music, Madonna proved that, whatever she was going for it was different and she could work it and sell it, and make her fans smile with a ghetto cowboy chic thing...
B000003S0I|5.0|How did they do it?  4 years and 4 lineups after essentially inventing progressive rock with \\"In the Court of the Crimson King,\\" King Crimson finally lived up to the promise of their 1969 debut.  They had to rip up the playbook to do it, however; \\"Lark's Tongues\\" is every bit as fresh and innovative as their first album.  While most progressive rock bands were perfecting their style (ELP's \\"Brain Salad Surgery\\") or summarizing past successes (Yes' \\"Yessongs\\"), King Crimson courageously broke with their past in search of a new style.<br />For Crimson Mark V, Fripp recruited ex-Yes drummer Bill Bruford, veteran bassist/vocalist John Wetton, and violinist David Cross.  Percussionist Jamie Muir added his unorthodox talents to this record before departing for a Buddhist monastery.  Many have rightly considered this the finest array of talent assembled by a progressive rock band.<br />In many ways, \\"Larks' Tongues\\" is even more impressive than Crimson's debut.  This album marks the band's successful entry into the realm of improvisational instrumental composition.  The mind-blowing opening title track is an unprecedented long-form exercise in progressive deconstructionism.  \\"The Talking Drum,\\" Arabesque in rhythm and tone color, builds magnificently to a chaos of guitar pick slides.  The abrupt segue from this into the chunky power chord intro of \\"Larks' Tongues in Aspic Part 2\\" might be the most euphoric moment in the Crimso discography.  The rest of \\"Part 2\\" deftly brings its hypnotic main riff through an series of ascending key changes, before culminating in yet another grand climax of controlled chaos.   <br />The more traditional, vocal-based numbers impress equally.  Jamie Muir's irreverent percussion highlights the whimsical rocker \\"Easy Money.\\" The epic ballad &quot;Exiles&quot; undulates gently yet grandly like ocean waves, echoing (without imitating) Crimso's earlier classic \\"Epitaph.\\"  The acoustic \\"Book of Saturday\\" bounces along nicely without percussion, andfeatures an eloquent backwards guitar solo and chilling violin passage during its final verse.<br />As with all Crimson masterpieces, \\"Larks' Tongues in Aspic\\" is certainly an acquired taste.  But the time invested in experiencing this record will be rewarded many times over.

B0000DD7LB|1.0|...and do NOT buy this. I liked Britney after her first 2, (\\"Oops! I Did it Again\\" and \\"...Baby one more time\\") but this is really not worth your dollar. Like that person with the helpful review said, the only reason she has a record deal is her \\"sex appeal.\\" In case you haven't noticed, she poses in nude magazines. Pop stars like Hilary Fluff are only here because they are pretty; they do not need vocal talent to get in. But this girl, it's like whoa!, even with a computerized voice, she doesn't sound good. In some songs, she tries to rap, but she fails. The background music (if you can call it that) is tiresome and boring, and sometimes you can't even hear Britney. It really does sound like she's \\"going against the music.\\" And no, she does not have that \\"boom boom.\\"<BR>I'm not going to lie and say I have this CD, because it's really that bad. Like many, I listened to the music at a friends' house. If you want to waste your money, go ahead and feel free to buy this. But I reccomend that if you do like pop, you should buy \\"Stripped\\" by Christina Aguilera or \\"Coverage\\" by Mandy Moore, because at least there's some vocal talent there. If you like \\"Me Against the Music,\\" then I suggest you buy the single (I know I said that singles were a waste of money before, but you're saving money with this deal).  <br />Once again, maybe if the record-people start giving us some GOOD music with actual substance, then we will buy CDs instead of downloading. <br />So, do yourself a favour and do NOT buy this waste of paper and plastic. Not only will you be saving yourself and the music industry, but you'll be saving the enviroment too.
0688163173|1.0|Having loved Lehane's previous books, I was really looking forward to this one.  What a disappointment!  Whereas his Kenzie/Gennaro series pushed the boundaries of its genre, and Mystic River transcended it altogether, Shutter Island reads like a first draft.  The situation is contrived, the characters are one-dimensional, the dialogue is replete with cliches, and the writing is just plain clunky.  I wanted to abandon the book long before the \\"surprise\\" ending, but having taken it on a plane with me I was stuck with it all the way to the bitter end.  Don't make my mistake! Reviewed by debvh for Amazon.com, 12/4/03.
B00005JM0B|2.0|This is a mediocre movie by any means, less than mediocre compared to The Terminator, and unwatchable compared to Terminator 2.  I don't care how many lasers the T-X fires while in that crane truck, the action was no where as riveting as the T2 18-wheeler vs the dirt bike.  An utterly uninspiring villian, barely a few threads of plot- many of which unravel once you start asking too many questions . . . (i.e. if Ah-nold has two hydrgen cells in him, why didn't he use one to off the T-1000 in the last movie?)  <br />All attempts of humor seemed campier and far less appropriate than the dark humor we have seen in the previous movies.<br />&quot;Talk to da hand!&quot; ?? where the hell is that coming from?<br />Edward Furlong made the best decision of his life to not be in this movie.  If this sequel was ever really worth making, James Cameron would have done it and he would have done it right. This should never had been made.
B0000AUHPG|5.0|A must see. Charles Bronson, Henry Fonda, Jason Robards, and Claudia Cardinalle. Currently voted as the number 2 western (of all time) on the international movie data base's website, and it is number 40 of any movie in any genre with an average score of 8.3/10. The first 10 minutes of the movie sells it all, so rather than me give away the plot, buy it, watch it, enjoy it for years to come. Directed by Sergio Leone and composed by Ennio Morricone, it couldn't fail.  It has everything one would expect from a Leone film, from the tight close-ups to the wide panaramic shots.
B0000E1ALR|4.0|Finally, a 2-CD set I can recommend to anyone who wants a career-spanning overview of Bruce's best work.  All of Bruce's albums are represented, remastering gives the earlier material a crisp, clean sound, and while you can quibble with the song selection, you can't really argue with it (with the exception of Mary's Place - yuck!).  5 stars for the essential Bruce CD's.<br />But what about that 3rd CD, you wonder.  Well, it's hardly Bruce's most \\"essential\\" non-album work, but with its range of themes and styles, it's not a bad bonus for fans already pining for something new (memo to the whiners: nobody is forcing you to buy this).  There are a few that make you say \\"wow!\\" and a few that make you say \\"huh?\\" A 3-star effort.  Also contributing to an overall rating of 4 stars instead of 5 is the packaging.  Liner notes are minimal and the bulk of the photos appear to be from the Lonesome Day video shoot.  Comments about each song (a la Greatest Hits) and more photos documenting Bruce's 30-year career would have been more informative for newbies and made this set something special even for fans who already have all these songs on CD.<br />Caveats aside, this set achieves its primary goal of providing a 2-CD \\"intro to Bruce.\\"  Whether you are new to Bruce or a casual fan upgrading to CD, this is a great place to start.
B0000DD7LB|1.0|I am not surprised this CD debuted at number one.  Anything Britney Spears would have released would have done so, that is the point where this teen sex symbol is at in her career.  The videos, the sex appeal, teen pop idol Britney Spears.  That is all fine and good, BUT no how about the music????  Well it stinks plain and simple.  I really thought Britney would get better with advancing albums, any good artist does.  Remember Madonnas 3rd album after her pop disco albums Madonna & Like A Virgin?  But there is a big difference between that sex symbol, she had some talent, she could sing, she found some good producers, and songs.  Britney has NONE of that, this is pure pop trash.  Moaning, heavy breathing, every song sounding the same.  What a bore, after 3 songs I am ready to break the CD.  I dont care how popular Britney Spears is, yea she will probably crack DOUBLE platinum on this one simply because of her present popularity.  But if this is the best musically she can do, it wont last.  The teenage girls are going to get older, and the new teenage girls are going to find someone else. Eventually devoted fans will buy music for just that MUSIC.  This could be the last hit by BS, next CD will go platinum and be a dissapointment, after that she'll be lucky to make gold and everyone will be saying what happened to Britneys career, can it be saved?  You have your answer ahead of time, not a chance!!

A bonus is the film was restored much to it's original length, adding in many minutes cut out of the US version.  The widescreen format is amazing.  The audio is very clear for what they had to work from, and the fact that they have 2-discs with bonus materials shows how much they cared.  Some interesting commentary, and nice features on the second disc.  This is one of my favorite DVDs.

B0000DD7NL|5.0|Thi album is incredible. If youre a soul and RnB fan, you will definetly enjoy this cd.  overall, there are no skip tracks, and the skits are kept to a minimum.  A definite buy.
B0000DD7LB|4.0|Well, I'm going to be honest with you. I have not heard this CD as yet but from the success of all her previous albums, I have no doubt in my mind that this album is superb. Britney Spears is a multi-talented woman and therefore she deserves a measure of respect from everyone, whether or not that person is a fan of Britney!!!
B0000DD7NL|5.0|Beautiful... gorgeous... exquisit... decadent... just what you'd expect from the godess of popular music
B00008PW2D|1.0|I'm a fan of this series, and I have the DVDs of all previous seaons. Yet I cannot fathom why Season 5, with so few episodes, is priced as much as the longer seasons. And I thought the price of Manolo Blahniks was inflated....
B00009V7T2|5.0|I love rock music, i love spending my freshly earned $ on new Cd's.  Even unwrapping that clear shrink wrap all leads to the enjoyment of getting a new CD, there is always that anticipation and excitetment as you take out the disc for its first time and prepare the player to start track one.....For the past long while that whole process has diminished for me, its seems like there has been nothing that turns my crank lately almost like the dark ages of rock.....till this.  At first listen all i could do was lay down, and enjoy.  My head rang in disbelief and the CD has been sitting in my sony ever since.
B0000DD7LB|3.0|She should've released &quot;Touch Of My Hand&quot; as the first single being that it's the best single on the album, but overall I don't see why it's gotten such a bad rap.  &quot;Breathe On Me&quot; is 2nd, &quot;Showdown&quot; is 3rd, and &quot;Boom Boom&quot; is 3rd.  It's not as good as her first album, but it's not bad.  Her all-time best song is near unheard of &quot;E-mail My Heart&quot; from her debut LP.
B000003TA4|5.0|Growing up as an early nineties kid, this was one of the most inspirational albums of my era.  The songs were anthems for young kids looking for some sort of &quot;niche&quot; to belong to that meant a little more than the previous neon wearing, syntho beat eighties.  Alot of critics say Kurt Cobain was nothing but a drugged out manic depressive.....maybe so, but first remember Morrison, Joplin, Vicious....(just to name a few)  Alot of the greatest artists out there could never solo like Clapton, or Lifeson...but the songs they made can still send a chill down our spines as we get sent back to remember what we might have been up to at those times.
B0000027F3|5.0|Bone crushing, mind numbing...this album kicks soooo much a**. Glenn and KK reached their peak here. The solos positively rip...I can't really think of a twin guitar attack that packs as much punch (save for Mustaine &amp; Friedman on Rust In Peace). <br />The singing and drumming is also awesome. <br />Top notch effort, possibly Priest's best. Can't go wrong with this one, folks.
B00005JSGK|5.0|HATARI! may be the most enjoyable of the Howard Hawks/John Wayne collaborations (their other pairings produced the classics RED RIVER and RIO BRAVO, and the RIO BRAVO 'remakes' EL DORADO and RIO LOBO), and is exceptional in several ways; at 157 minutes (2 hours, 37 minutes), it may be one of the longest 'buddy' films ever made; nearly all of the animal 'chase and capture' sequences involved the actual cast members (professional handlers serving as stunt doubles were only rarely used); and the filming began with virtually no script (which was written based on the 'on location' footage in Africa, after the cast returned to California). At 65, director Hawks was still in top form, and the risks he took paid off...HATARI!, despite it's length, is never boring!<br /><br />The story focuses on a season with a team of professional hunter/trappers, capturing animals for zoos and circuses. With a breathtaking opening scene of a rhino chase, costing them the use of veteran driver, 'Indian' (legendary actor Bruce Cabot), the 'family' dynamic is quickly established, with rugged Sean Mercer (Wayne) both boss and father-figure to the group. As he and the rest of the 'family' (Red Buttons, Hardy Kr&uuml;ger, Valentin de Vargas, and Mich&egrave;le Girardon) meet 'Indian's' replacement, 'Chips' (G&eacute;rard Blain), Mercer has an even bigger headache to deal with; beautiful photographer Anna Maria 'Dallas' D'Allesandro (Elsa Martinelli) has arrived, to shoot a magazine spread. A 'traditional' Hawks leading lady, 'Dallas' is feisty, sultry, and attracted to Mercer, and the older man, uncomfortable with the ease by which she fits into the group, as well as his own stirrings, tries to make it clear that romance has no place on his agenda (in much the same manner as he did with Angie Dickinson in RIO BRAVO...and with the same results).<br /><br />While some elements of the story are dated and politically incorrect (shooting a baby African elephant, even as a 'mercy killing', would be a major offense, today, as it is an endangered species), the combination of spectacular 'hunt' sequences, and the warmth and easy camaraderie of the cast in the subplots make HATARI! a rich, rewarding experience.<br /><br />A major plus for the film is a very atypical Henry Mancini score, combining tense, African-influenced themes for the chases, and the very funny 'Baby Elephant Walk' to punctuate 'Dallas's' relationship with her adopted pachyderm 'children'. The baby elephant scenes are film highlights, as is the rocket capture of a tree filled with monkeys, and both rhino chases (which clearly shows Wayne in some real danger!)<br /><br />From the opening rhino sequence to the closing 'Honeymoon' scene, HATARI! is a grand entertainment, and escapism at it's best!endangered species), the combination of spectacular 'hunt' sequences, and the warmth and easy camaraderie of the cast in the subplots make HATARI! a rich, rewarding experience.

B0000025YM|4.0|With the exception of Love Bites and Eat Me Alive (both of which are tedious and as such qualify as filler tracks)...this album rocks. HARD. <br />The first track I heard off this was The Sentinel and it blew me away. Awesome riffs, cool singing...couldn't ask for more! The rest of the album is much the same, all songs except for the two I mentioned at the beginning are consistently good. <br />Two best tracks are probably The Sentinel, and Rock Hard Ride Free...which has AWESOME solos. Though like I said, the rest are all great too. <br />Heavy Duty/Defenders Of The Faith is a great way to end this album as well. <br />3 thumbs up.
0792841344|5.0|I became a huge fan of the &quot;Phantasm&quot; franchise without ever watching the first film in the series. Cable channels around these parts used to show both &quot;Phantasm 2&quot; and &quot;Phantasm 3&quot; constantly, so those two films formed the basis of my knowledge about this weird horror series. With the advent of DVD, I finally decided to see where it all began and acquired a copy of Don Coscarelli's 1979 cult classic. Sure, &quot;Phantasm&quot; is about as low budget as you can get, even for a horror film, but the amazing thing about this movie is that a lack of funds did not hurt it at all. In fact, some of the plot holes that a bigger budget would have filled in actually work in the movie's favor. By not really understanding who the Tall Man is or why he does what he does, &quot;Phantasm&quot; assumes enigmatic dimensions that practically beg for explanation through further sequels. Coscarelli, who I think is planning yet another sequel in this franchise, has also made a few other films over the years: the recent &quot;Bubba Ho-tep&quot; and the ubiquitous cable favorite &quot;The Beastmaster&quot; are the most memorable.<br />Reggie, Jody, and Jody's younger brother Mike soon learn strange things are afoot at the Morningside Funeral Home. After a funeral service for a friend of Reggie and Jody, Mike sees the eerie undertaker at the funeral home heave a three hundred pound casket in the back of a hearse all by himself. Intrigued, Mike begins to investigate the funeral home and this puzzling figure, fondly known to fans of the series as the Tall Man, and unearths a whole heap of weirdness. Before long Jody and Reggie get caught up in the madness of the Tall Man's world. What they discover behind the walls of the funeral home is a nightmare of endless dangers: twisted, angry little creatures clad in robes, a portal to another dimension, and small flying spheres that seek out human flesh with disastrous and bloody results. As the three attempt to put together the odd pieces of this puzzle, the Tall Man and his minions always lurk in the background ready to do serious bodily injury to the interlopers. What Reggie, Mike, and Jody discover is hardly reassuring: the Tall Man is some sort of other dimensional being roaming our world in search of corpses. He then reanimates the bodies and transforms them into stunted little creatures so he can transport them into his dimension. Why does he do this? Who knows, but it is fun watching our three heroes battle the Tall Man in this film and the subsequent sequels.<br />One of the best elements of &quot;Phantasm&quot; is the characters. You have the Tall Man (Angus Scrimm), a lumbering giant of a man dressed all in black and sporting a perpetual scowl. He delivers his lines, of which there are few in this movie but more in subsequent films, in a growling tone full of dark menace. Scrimm is creepy as the Tall Man, and I think this character may well be one of my favorite horror film bad guys. The actors who play Reggie, Jody, and Mike appear in all of the sequels (with a minor switch in two), an important continuity because it gives the &quot;Phantasm&quot; franchise a real &quot;contained universe&quot; feel lacking in most horror series. It was fun for me to watch the original film after seeing the later sequels because the guys are so much younger here. Jody sports a '70's coif that would do Starsky and Hutch proud, and Reggie looks so young that it is almost frightening.<br />&quot;Phantasm&quot; films always contain elements that make for a great, downbeat atmosphere. The music is absolutely fantastic, and if I had to compare the background beats of &quot;Phantasm&quot; with the sound of another horror film it would have to be something along the lines of Kubrick's &quot;The Shining.&quot; The movie sounds creepy, and when matched with the mostly shot at night scenes and the wickedly gory rampages of those metallic spheres, the whole film takes on a most memorable feel. Coscarelli does not rely solely on gripping horror, however, as there are many humorous scenes throughout the film. The scene where Mike and Jody do battle with the severed finger is one of the funniest I have seen in a horror movie. Even the fake looking bug and the gruesome little minions of the Tall Man are amusing in their own right.<br />If you want to buy just one DVD because of the extras, you should get this one. I couldn't believe how much stuff they packed on one disc! You get lengthy deleted scenes, a commentary with Coscarelli and the film's actors, a long interview with Coscarelli and Angus Scrimm made years ago with some film professor, a short film of an appearance Angus Scrimm made at a horror convention, trailers, a disco version of the theme song (!), poster and lobby card pictures, a kooky promotional ad made by Angus Scrimm for the Australian market, and a widescreen picture transfer. I especially enjoyed the footage of Scrimm speaking at a horror film convention. Even though it was a bit corny, he quickly ran through all of the lines the Tall Man said in the &quot;Phantasm&quot; films, and since most of his dialogue in these movies is so memorable it was great to hear him say them in character. Overall, it felt like it took longer to view all of the extras on this disc than it did to watch the film! If you haven't delved into the dark world of &quot;Phantasm,&quot; start here and rapidly move on to the excellent sequels.scarelli does not rely solely on gripping horror, however, as there are many humorous scenes throughout the film.

B0000025RQ|5.0|This is a great album, no doubt about it. Great riffs n solos, plenty of hooks. Not a single filler track here. <br />As great as this album is, I can't understand why people say that after it, Priest went downhill. That's simply not true. Defenders Of The Faith is just as good as this album if not better, so is Painkiller...and Ram It Down has plenty of great songs to offer as well. <br />I'd recommend this to anyone into ACDC all the way to some of the newer metal bands such as Children Of Bodom (who owe a lot to the likes of Priest). <br />Best track? My favorite is probably Fever.
B00005QDW5|5.0|This literally only covers one-forth of their career! Where is Fat Old Sun? Where is Welcome To The Machine? WHERE IS JUGBAND BLUES??? But I guess it does cover their greatest HITS. Radio hits anyway. (It's even missing some of those) But thats okay. I still give it 5 stars for being FLOYD. The almitey. <br />This is my opinion, buy this if you are new to Pink Floyd. If you don't like forget it and throw it in the back of your closet. If you do like it (which i'm sure you will), BUY AS MUCH FLOYD AS YOU CAN! Every one of their albums are great!<br />Either way: BUY THIS
B0000DD7NL|5.0|This album is a soulful melody that just have me jamming from beginning to end and back again to the beginning. She has an old soul. My favorites now is her remake to &quot;If I was your woman&quot;, &quot;Diary&quot;, &quot;Dragon Days&quot;, and of course &quot;You don't know my name&quot;. She came back and let people know that she's not going to give it to us once.  She hit it hard.  I definitely recommend this album.

B00009RDG8|5.0|I enjoyed this movie primarily because of the survival skills underscoring the plot.  Tommy Lee Jones, in my opinion, always makes his characters interesting.  Del Toro, too, was engaging in this role - given the limited confines of the script.  The extra features included on the DVD edition made the whole experience richer and even caused me to want to read the books of Thomas H Brown Jr. who was a consultant for the film and the real life basis for Jones' character.
B00008PW2D|3.0|Of the 6 seasons, this one has to be the weakest. After the amazing fourth season, this one seemed to be treading water. That's not to say it didn't have it's moments. Charlotte's storyline regarding the Jewish attorney was hilarious. Miranda's motherhood was explored realistically. However, Carrie and Samantha stories seemed to be repetitive.I did like Carrie having to do a book signing with that \\"alien\\" dog a highlight. I wished there was more of Amy Sedaris. She should have been a bigger character. Maybe if the season had been longer there would have been more time to flesh out the stories. Understandably, Sarah Jessica Parker's pregnancy had something to do with it. Overall, I enjoy this show over most on regular television. However,this DVD should not cost as much as it does for only 2 discs and 8 episodes.I don't believe the quality alone justifies the price.

0385334206|5.0|I have used this book on several occasions to introduce friends and family to Vonnegut.  In this fast and easy read, you have all of Vonnegut's strengths, all the elements of his masterpieces (Slaughterhouse-Five, Cat's Cradle, etc.) in one amazing novel.  It is hilarious and ridiculous at times (he illustrates the novel himself with hand-drawn pictures of underpants and wide-open beavers), but always there is the genuine love for human beings and the deep feelings of hope and loss which Vonnegut and his fellow WW2 soldier/writer Joseph Heller are famous for.  <br />     Read this book as an introduction to his other works.  If you've already read some of Vonnegut's works, you can find all the threads of his philosophy come together here.  Make it the beginning and the end to a Vonnegut study-- die-hard fans, read it again!  You will discover something new to enjoy every time you read it.  <br />     Ah, and this is one of those situations where the film adaptation should NOT be substituted for the real thing, nor should you judge the book by the horrid movie of the same name.
B00005JM02|5.0|This is the most profitable animated movie of all time and there's a reason for that.  The plot is excellent, the voices of people like Ellen DeGeneres, Albert Brooks, Willem Defoe, and Geoffrey Rush are skillfully done, and the scenery is just amazing. . .so beautiful and realistic that you simultaneously feel like you could swim in the water and that you want a print of every scene for your wall (well, maybe not the scene when they're in the dark. . .)<BR>I took another look at this one the other day and, although Disney/Pixar went with a special features format that doesn't make it the easiest to access, the special features it does have are really quite good.  See, the special features are split up, with some on the full-screen DVD and some on the wide-screen DVD (both versions are included).  I found that the better features are on the wide-screen DVD.  That one has an amazing visual tour with such highlights as watching Ellen DeGeneres and Geoffrey Rush reading their lines (surprisingly entertaining) and snippets on the evolution of the characters and story.  There are also pictures of the models that they used for the characters and the aquarium feature on the wide-screen DVD has different scenes that you can choose.  On the full-screen disc, Msr. Cousteau's \\"documentary\\" is a highlight.<BR>This is a truly wonderful movie.  Everyone I know who's seen it, loves it.
B0000DD7LC|4.0|I loved alicia keys'e first offering and predictably her second offering wasn't going to be as good.BUT don't fret for it is still a good album.<br />More chilled out then her debut it's more slow jam oriented with more classical tones(particularly on 'karma')so some myabe dissapointed if they are looking for stunners like 'fallin' or 'a woman's worth'.Overall the best track is her new single 'you don't know my name' but there are also gems to be found in 'karma','if i was your woman','if i ain't got you','so simple'(very catchy babyish vocals)and 'slow down' with it's beautiful cascading bridges.<BR>I would recommend anyone 2buy this record.it's very nice 2listen to while chillin out and what goes without saying is ms.keys is an amazing artist with an amazing talent!
B00008PC2O|5.0|This is one of those movies I just had to have in my DVD collection. Even though it's an action movie there is also a story to it. I find T2 a much better movie thatn T3. T2 was a well executed movie, whereas T3, with a completely different director, was just an attempt to cash in during the summer box office season.
B00000IAU3|1.0|I listened to this after the awful Life For Rent. After the reviewers there generally said it was better.....hah couldnt be worse. <br />No Angel, no passion, no strong songs, no emotion, no insight, no sign of life. Ok My Lovers Gone is starting to get there. But its all too much for Dido and she slips back down the slope into the bland pit again.<br />I know Eminem is fond of trying to steal choruses from outrageously anodyne stars, Sir Elton and Dido are two. I suppose its his way of being ironic, who next, Donny Osmond or Barry Manilow? <br />All I can say is if there was a talent/emotion/invention fight between the Red Team; Dido, McLachlan, Dion, Carey, Enya and the Blue Team; PJ Harvey, Amos, Orton, Nova, and we'll throw in a gamble Pink. My 1 million bucks would be safe on the Blue Team to win in the first round.  <br />Come on life has got to be about more than is emoted on this album!
B0000DD7LC|5.0|Don't get me wrong, I like Songs In A Minor but I really LOVE this one. Alicia has truly matured over the past two years and she has a lot more variety on here. She truly sings from her heart and soul and is very genuine about what she does. Not to mention she is the FIRE ON THOSE KEYS! MAN! I have never seen someone play like her since Roberta Flack! <BR>There are not many real artists out there like her and she is one that exemplifies what a REAL artist should be. Also, I have never seen someone take some classical music and modernize it and make it so enjoyable. I now LOVE some Beethoven and Chopin! I also love the way she takes old school tunes and put her own touch to it. She's not like any of these other artists who try and put some recycled beats to an old school tune no less try and SING them. PURE GENIOUS! Her production team is AWESOME.

0345446798|5.0|Patricia McConnell's book is packed full of information to help people understand their dog's behavior. The truly delightful and and helpful ingredient is that McConnell gives us a very good look at human behavior. McConnell is very good at showing us where we match - companionship, meeting nurturing needs, enjoyment of a foreign species, and most importantly, showing us where we don't match - heeling, resource guarding, comprehending verbal instructions. <br />I use the information in Patricia McConnell's book in the dog training classes that I teach to help my clients understand the world through a dog's eyes. Dogs are delightful in many ways, but they are not interested in viewing the world from a human perspective. Once my clients are able to understand why dogs do the things they do, training can really progress.<br />Patricia McConnell's book does a great job of telling personal and professional dog stories as well as providing valuable information. Her love for her own small pack of dogs as well as the dogs she meets in her practice shines through.<br />I love this book. I have given it to many of my teen volunteers and have recommended it to my entire dog training club. It's a definite five stars.
B0000CFW87|4.0|I think this is a very wonderful CD. Josh's singing is gorgeous, and even though it is over produced at times, it is well worth having and sharing with others.<BR>  <BR>I cannot understand why there are no translations for the songs in Italian, Spanish and French.  The liner notes are difficult to read and provide inconsistent information that is at best confusing. <br />Considering the careful attention paid to all other aspects of the production of this CD, I find this missing detail to be very odd.
B0000DYJM6|5.0|Pearl Jam certainly dont seem to take their fans for granted, releasing this and a live DVD on the same day a few weeks ago. As the alpha exports of the Seattle scene which exploded  a decade ago, they have always been prolific, but for the first time this compilation of b-sides, rarities and all sorts finally puts into perspective just _how_ prolific these seemingly invincible veterans are. Not only that, 'Lost Dogs' is a searing testament to the breadth and extraordinary wealth of talent the band posseses. This being Pearl Jam, their compilation is not just any old collection of ragtags. What we have here is cuts that never made it on to the bands studio albums, perhaps because they did not adhere to a specific mood or tone the album was intended to evoke, or perhaps because they simply would have pushed the albums running time out too far. This should make it plain that a lot of the unreleased material here is easily as good as anything on their studio efforts. Of course, die-hards would already be aware of this, having been engrossed in singing the classic 'Yellow Ledbetter' at concerts for years now. This song finally sees the light of day here, along with forgotten gems like 'Black, Red Yellow' and 'Dead Man'.<br /> What makes 'Lost Dogs' special for me though is not the effortless consistency present in the material, or the joy of hearing old standards re-packaged and produced, and heard as they were meant to be heard. The songs on 'Lost Dogs', presented in this format, transcend any of the tired cliches surrounding 'grunge' and all its trappings, displaying the raw wealth of Pearl Jam's talent and stripping their entire ethos back to its roots. Theres a distinct pleasure, not to mention satisfaction, in hearing gorgeous 'Binaural' era cuts like 'Sad' and 'Fatal' alongside classics like Alone' or 'Wash'. Even 'Riot Act' outtakes like 'Down' shinelike diamonds in amongst these gems. Indeed, one feels like this is the archetype form for a Pearl Jam release: songs like the relentlessly sombre and delicate 'strangest tribe' rub shoulders so well with exuberant covers of 'Leaving Here', or the silly 'Gremmie out of control' that a sense that the band are really enjoying themselves and letting, well, it all hang out so to speak permeates the record.<br /> I shouldnt really have to preach to fans here: this record is utterly mandatory for you. The highest accolade I can bestow here is that, for future beginners, fans like me may well see fit to direct them to 'Lost Dogs' to locate the apex of the bands career. An enduring and essential testament to a formidable talent, 'Lost Dogs' recieves my highest possible recommendation.like the relentlessly sombre and delicate 'strangest tribe' rub shoulders so well with exuberant covers of 'Leaving Here', or the silly 'Gremmie out of control' that a sense that the band are really enjoying themselves and letting, well, it all hang out so to speak permeates the record.<BR> I shouldnt really have to preach to fans here: this record is utterly mandatory for you.

B0000DD7LB|4.0|Don't judge a CD by its cover or a review by its title.  This is a relatively good CD for what it tries to accomplish.  It shouldn't win any awards, but its fun fluff music with no real meaning or message.  <br />1. Me Against the Music (featuring Madonna) - Against the Music, the first few times, is a pretty good track.  But boy does it quickly spawn an earworm, can't get it out of my head.<br />2. (I Got That) Boom Boom (featuring Ying Yang Twins) - A tad too bubble gummish, but fun.<BR>     <BR>3. Showdown - Okay<br />4. Breathe On Me - Without those &quot;extra&quot; sounds Britney throws in, its an ordinary track<BR>  <BR>5. Early Mornin'  - Lyrics were.... meh, but it was a good track.<br />6. Toxic - Good beat on this one.<br />7. Outrageous - Not one of my favs on the album.<BR>        <BR>8. Touch of My Hand - Once again, the lyrics could either make you wretch or cry.  But I liked the sound of this track.<BR>       <BR>9. The Hook Up - Fun track.<BR>    <BR>10. Shadow - Comme Ci Comme Ca<BR>        <BR>11. Brave New Girl - Mixing and producing helps cover up flawed singing voice on this one.  But overall presentation was quality.<BR>        <BR>12. Everytime - Much too common of a track title.  Check Kazaa =).<BR>        <BR>13. Me Against the Music (featuring Madonna) Rishi Rich's Desi Kulcha Remix - Didn't like the Remix as much as the original, but its a bonus track, so its alright.<br />Nothing mind-blowing or revolutionary.  But a very serviceable album once one puts aside certain bias towards the artist.  But honestly, most of the credit should go to the producer of the album.  Britney is the front, but she fills that role admirably.
B000099T2L|4.0|It has been obvious since her days with Destiny's Child that Beyonce had what it took to make it in the business, but could she prove that she could make it on her own??? Beyonce has answered that question with an absolute &quot;Yes&quot;! This is a great CD and shows that Beyonce has grown not only as an artist, but also as a young woman. My personal favorites are &quot;Me, Myself, and I&quot;, &quot;Signs&quot;, &quot;Yes&quot;, and above all &quot;Thats How U Like It&quot;.<br />Great CD!
B00003CXA6|2.0|This movie was excellent except for the depiction of General Robert E Lee which was absolutely horrible.  Martin Sheen's depiction of a snivelling, second guessing, wimp was so off base.  Casting Sheen as Lee was a total blasphemy of Lee's character.  Regardless of his service to the Confederacy, Lee was an outstanding leader, intelligent and strong,  You would expect to see a bigger then life man motivating and captivating his troops while standing strong and true. Whoever made this casting decision made the wrong one.  Every other character and aspect of this film was almost true to life...it is an excellent experience if you can get past the scenes with Sheen.  ...but, to be truly honest, Martin Sheen really ruined the film for me which is the reason why I have never viewed it again since it was released.
B00005B36H|5.0|i've read a few reviews, and it appears that i've been listening to a completely different lateralus the past two years.  some \\"reviewers\\" mention that this album is for \\"urbanite teenage depressed rock wanna-bees\\". i guess i fit into that category considering that i am a brown skin brooklynite(new yorker) who grew up listening to hip hop. but reading these lame reviews i see that people judge music in boxes. tool is not obeying conventional laws of hard rock that were consciously established by the forefathers of the form. i'm sure the gods of rock you are a slave to are furious with this fact. listen cloesly. this album is a masterpiece of art not because it is the best tool album ever or the best album ever or the best hard rock album in a long time, but it is an experience in itself. if any of you reviewers have ever done any creative work that is from your soul you would know that what the end product is barely resembles what lies in that part of you that was inspired to create it. the album does not even need to be segmented into the songs i liked and the ones i did not understand. i need not discuss technical structures of songs and the meaning of lyrics. the album goes beyond what you normally conceive of as an album. it builds up to something. it is a journey through an experience.

B00003CX9Q|5.0|I was a boy of 7 the first time I saw E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial, and I remember being so completely engrossed in the story and so completely moved by the tender relationship between E.T. and his human friend, Elliot, that I longed to see the film again.  Little did I know that it would be over 10 years before the film would be released for sale in any form.<br />As an adult, I had the privilege of taking my son to see this same film in the theaters.  The new release, which featured scenes that had been filmed but never seen, was as much a treat for me as it was for him.  I found that E.T. had lost none of its innocence, none of its poignancy, and none of its beauty in the 20 years it had been out of the theaters.  In fact, it brought with its anniversary a new found wonder-that a generation that had changed so much in 20 years could and would still embrace a film that focused on love, innocence and friendship as its common themes.<br />I was also thrilled when Stephen Spielberg released his classic film on DVD later that same year.  <br />This collection is great.  It features the film in its original format, and in its 20th anniversary reworking, with new effects and scenes added to enhance the classic that the world knew and loved.  While some critics have argued that the changes and additions detract from the movie, I think that they are fun, and add an element of joy to moviegoers who were already familiar with the film.  For those that had never seen it before, the new scenes do nothing to detract from the film, or alter the storyline, and so their addition should be of no consequence at all.<br />For those of you who aren't familiar with E.T. (is there anyone out there who isn't?), it is the story of an alien who is left behind on Earth, after his spaceship is discovered by the U.S. government and departs before he makes his return to the craft.  It is the story of a boy who befriends this alien and learns that love has no earthly bounds.  It is the story ofchildren, who unite to help save the little alien, E.T., from his would-be government captors and return him to his own people.  <br />The movie features state-of-the-art effects from its era, and the newly released special edition also features cutting edge effects from today, enhancing the film where limitations of technology left some scenes looking less than realistic.  With a soundtrack that has been enhanced by Academy Award Winning Composer John Williams (who wrote the original score in 1982), this film has a fresh look that makes it look as current as any film shot today.<br />The DVD collection does contain extras, including an hour-long reunion video that was shot for the re-release of E.T. in 2002.  The video features the original cast, reunited for the first time since the movie made its debut in 1982.  The interviews offer insights into the making of the film along with the dynamic relationships the cast and crew had with each other.  <br />This is a great movie for the whole family.  It is one of those rare films that audiences of all ages will enjoy.  It is truly a piece of cinema magic, with a heartfelt story at its core. <br />-Scott Kolecki
B000084T18|1.0|He gave the message out that if you want to become popular diss on a well-known artist. That already shows his ignorant talent. Can't you rap about something else than car with rims, drugs, money, and girls? He needs to go buy some education he sounds like a total MORAN when he talks with double, triple, cuadruaple negatives and uses words that are not even in the English dictionary. I grew up listening to rap oh yeah Thank you for making me feel better when I am down and come home and you are rapping about  nice cars, clothes, and jewelry that I don't even have. DONT JEOPARIZE YOUR EDUCATION BECAUSE YOU WANT TO IMITATE THIS ILLITERATE RAPPER YOU DON\\"T HAVE TO GO BROKE TRYING TO HAVE MORE THAN YOUR NEIGHBOOR. Don't support this garbage.
B00005JKQZ|2.0|Unfortunately `A Beautiful Mind' sums up all that is wrong with Hollywood. Director Ron Howard takes the true story of Nobel laureate John Nash (played by Russell Crowe) and retells it in mawkishly sentimental and unconvincing fashion. That mathematical genius Nash overcame acute schizophrenia to win the respect of the academic world is undisputedly a story worth telling. But it is handled so clumsily, that it really does make you laugh out loud sometimes. The cinematic device Howard uses to explain how Nash `sees' numbers - they mysteriously light up and lift off the page - really could have been a little more complex and imaginative. How the awkward, anti-social, charmless Crowe manages to woo a stunner like Jennifer Connolly (I assume the real Mrs Nash was a little more ordinary looking...) - apparently because he was a numbers genius, which is clearly what all women look for in a man - is again wholly unconvincing.  And the make-up artists responsible for ageing Connolly thirty years should be fired immediately!<br />There are some good element to the film. The scene where Nash uses a mathematical hypothesis to maximise his and his friends chances of `scoring' with some ladies, is amusing. Crowe is actually pretty good in the role, and none of the actors deliver bad performances. The responsibility for such an obvious, cliched interpretation lies squarely on Howard's shoulders, and the fact that he won the best director gong at the Academy Awards says all there is to say about the Academy. Commercialism and sentimentality win out over originality and imagination. Again.
B00008WG3U|4.0|There are only two songs on this CD I didn't like (&quot;We Got Two Jealous Again's&quot; and &quot;13 Stitches&quot;), and that's only because they were slightly boring.  &quot;Mattersville&quot; and &quot;Anarchy Camp&quot; are such fun, ska songs, I really love how NoFX did them.  &quot;Irrationality of Rationality&quot;, &quot;Franco Un-American&quot; and &quot;American Errorist (I Hate Hate Haters)&quot; made me so happy because it's rare to find a band that completely agrees with the political views that I hold.  And I have an interesting theory about &quot;Whoops, I OD'd&quot;:  I think that this is their last CD because of this song.  NoFX never does emo-type songs, this is the first emo song they've done.  Also, the last line mentions okiedogs....hmmm...so I think NoFX isn't making anymore albums.

The reason that Aliens does not have a DTS soundtrack is because DTS did not exist back in 1986 when the movie came out.
6303012140|5.0|This movie is a sort of RoboCop 3 comic adventure. John Spartan, a soldier of our time, was arrested because he was accused responsible for the lives lost in a building that exploded. A new method of imprisonment was found and he was put in it. He was encased in ice. His enemy Simon Pheonix is too imprisoned, and years later, Pheonix escapes and reeks havoc in the futuristic la-la land Los Angeles. The only person capable of beating him is Spartan because in the future there are no guns except in museums.<BR>This is a humorous, action packed but somewhat light-hearted action/adventure. Stallone and Snipes play awsome enemies against each other. This film is rated R for uh...uh...good question. The content is so limited. I guess there's some very mild language, gunplay and somewhat intense sexual content. Why not PG-13 at least?
B0000E1WKE|3.0|Whitney Houston has been blessed with a remarkable voice, and I was excited to see a Christmas album from her.  She is, without a doubt, one of the most talented singers ever, but I agree that her voice is not up to par.  I expected her to belt out every song, especially &quot;O Holy Night.&quot;  You NEED a voice like hers to sing that song, but it just didn't get there.  Not like &quot;I Will Always Love You&quot; and other songs that sent a chill up my spine when she would hit those notes - which are few in this album.  It seems the songs are purposely softer for that reason.  I enjoyed her take on some, but expected more of the classic versions.

B000002KBU|5.0|In the career of every celebrated artist there is one work of art which stands above all others, one that is celebrated as the pinnacle of artistry, the apex to which all that preceded it has led, and against which all that follows it will forever be compared.  &quot;Blue&quot; is that album in the gallery of Joni Mitchell's musical masterpieces: it is THE masterpiece, so much so that when all the other Mitchell albums have faded from the mind, it is &quot;Blue&quot; that persists in the memory.  Every (and I do assert EVERY) song on the album weaves unique melodies with profound lyrics.  The acoustic and piano arrangements are, by turn, eminent, sparse, twisted, and flowing.  But the music becomes the secondary element on an album that delivers an overwhelming amount of philosophy, tragedy, and poetry.  The album starts with &quot;All I Want&quot;, a proclamation of the love-and-hate duality of all relationships.  From there, Joni celebrates her much-too-absent lover in the anti-establishment &quot;My Old Man&quot;.  One of the most personal songs on the album, &quot;Little Green&quot;, tells Joni's own story of having to give away her infant daughter.  &quot;Carey&quot; is the most upbeat song on the album, telling of strange and special encounters, and her &quot;mean old daddy&quot;.  The title track is, expectedly, searing and sad, a musical mourning that echoes later in the album.  &quot;California&quot; is essentially a love song to the state in which Joni honed her art in Laurel Canyon.  &quot;This Flight Tonight&quot; is one of my favorite Mitchell songs, though it gets very little notice.  The acoustic playing is very rousing and the song is almost furiously temperamental.  The final three songs on the album are the unoffical &quot;Great Trilogy of Tragedy&quot;.  NYT Critic Stephen Holden recently said, &quot; 'Blue' went to a level of psychic pain and tragedy that no one had sung up to then, and that no one has sung since.&quot;  These last three songs prove why.  The dull ache of &quot;River&quot;, a holiday song that is about anything but the holidays, is the essential song of hope when there is really nothing to be hopeful about.  Perhaps the best song on the album(and perhaps the best of any Mitchell song) is the profoundly mournful &quot;A Case of You&quot;, a retracing of the death of Love and the lament of what was and what will never be again.  There is no other song I can think of that so perfectly captures the grief that accompanies the end of a relationship.  &quot;The Last Time I Saw Richard&quot; is a reflection on a man and on Love, sharing much the same theme as 'Both Sides  Now'. Needless to say, &quot;Blue&quot; is as profound as it is melodic, the truly essential Joni Mitchell work. If ever there was a substantial popular album that worked as well as verse as composition, this is it.

0812550706|5.0|There has been a few times in my life that a book has hit me so hard that it almost left me staggering from the blow.  Ender's Game by Orson Scott Card is one of those books. It is so full of insight and amazingly developed characters that it feels real. This is despite the fact that the main characters are very young children with intellects that are higher than your average adult.<br />The story takes place in Earth's future.  The planet has been attacked several times by an alien race known as the \\"buggers.\\"  The attacks took place years before the novel opens, and the surviving humans fear that another may occur soon.  Since humanity won the last war by a stroke of luck, they are trying to find a leader that will have the fortitude and skill to win the next war.  They search for these leaders among the children of Earth.  This is where Ender Wiggin comes into play.  It is determined that he might have the ability to be \\"the one\\" that could rise up to defeat the aliens.  The book is all about this discovery.<br />I would not want to give away any of the delicious plot of this incredible novel.  Suffice it to say that it is a dark and sinister work full of suspense.  It is not a book to begin at night in bed unless you plan on getting no sleep.  It is simply impossible to put down.  The premise almost sounds laughable.  Believe me, it isn't.  Card's greatest strength is character development.  If you go into this book expecting typical \\"action\\" you will not get what you are anticipating.  It is not a simple \\"fight the aliens\\" book.  It is full of deep meaning, and it spoke straight to my heart.  I identified with the main characters so much it was scary.  The themes and motifs in this novel stay with you.  It is impossible for this review to do the book justice.  I, honestly, often tell people about it when I am browsing in a bookstore and find another person looking for a novel standing beside me.  I have caused several strangers to by the book because of the praise I give it.  I think everyone should read it.  Even if you do not like science fiction, you would like this book.  It is honestly my second favorite book of ALL TIME, and, trust me, I have read more than your average bookworm.raise I give it.  I think everyone should read it.  Even if you do not like science fiction, you would like this book.  It is honestly my second favorite book of ALL TIME, and, trust me, I have read more than your average bookworm.

B000002HEP|5.0|This album shows rock at its absolute greatest.  I've owned 5 different copies of this CD, after having one 'borrowed' by a friend or donating it to a favorite bar's jukebox.  Whether or not you've heard of or about this band, buy this now.  This is what rock is all about, it is why people cling onto it with such zeal and abandon.  After repeated listenings, you'll wonder why this band never broke.  They are the Nirvana of the stoner rock category.
B0000C6E4D|3.0|I give this album 3 stars because Sarah McLachlan is extremely talented in whatever she does.<BR>  It is a good album, great for Sarah fans...some of the songs sound almost like filler..which is not good because it only has 10 songs on it. Possibly this album just needs to grow on me. Honestly I was expecting more out of this CD..I think she could really mix things up and I know she has the potential, but her simple ballads become tiring here..Overall a good CD, nothing phenomenal..<br />Chris
0385504209|5.0|This book is one of the best, well-written novels i have read in a long time. It combines mystery with history, and takes you on an incredible journey which leaves you wanting more. I could not put the book down. Through reading the book, i have instigated researching more on the topic and it has changed the way i veiw the Church now. I recommend it to everyone!!!!!! I convinced my friends, who don't like to read, to just glance over a chapter or two, and when i tried to get my book back, they told me,&quot;Wait! Just one more chapter!&quot;
B00005JM02|5.0|Finding Nemo is a wonderful underwater fairytale - unique in that it is one of those few movies that fully lives up to the hype it has received. The animation is incredible - you feel like you are right there under the sea with them! The voice acting is superb and you get the sense that the actors really put themselves into the mindset of the characters they are playing. The story captures both the attention of young and old, mixing humor and drama equally as a desperate father teams up with a quirky, crazy new friend in a search for his lost son.<br />If you are a fan of classics like &quot;The Little Mermaid&quot; and &quot;Beauty and the Beast&quot; then you will love &quot;Finding Nemo&quot;. The primary difference (that in my opinion makes the story better) is that there really is no &quot;bad guy&quot; trying to foil the main character - he just has to overcome the overwhelming odds against him in his search. It's a truly delightful story for both young and old.
0345452577|4.0|In &quot;The Conspiracy Club, Jonathan Kellerman departs from his Alex Delaware series with a new protagonist who is moodier and has more of an edge. Jeremy Carrier, a staff psychologist at City Central hospital, is a loner who becomes emotionally distant when his lover is brutally slain. He is unsure of his worth as a psychologist and mistrustful of the motives of others. When he is approached by an elderly eccentric pathologist named Arthur Chess, Jeremy tries to avoid him. However, through persistence and an invitation to a sumptuous but odd dinner meeting with a group of retired intellectuals, Dr. Chess draws Jeremy into pondering violence and virtue and leads him to question his role in this strange circle of friends. Jeremy begins to receive cryptic journal articles and postcards that draw his attention to a series of violent murders. He suddenly finds himself the prime suspect of these gruesome deeds and harassed by a homicide detective. As the clock ticks down, Jeremy must track down a psychopath to protect the new love of his life and to prove his own innocence.<br />This is typical Kellerman fare, reminiscent of his previous novel &quot;The Murder Book.&quot;  In both stories, the protagonists are given a series of enigmatic clues by persons unknown and then left to follow their crooked trail wherever it might lead. Although the story starts off slowly while developing Jeremy's tortured soul, it picks up speed and ends with a twist. The book contains thought-provoking ideas on the nature and origin of violent behavior and is an entertaining story.

055370026X|4.0|Grisham's books have been progressively less good after A Time to Kill, The Firm and The Pelican Brief.  The Pelican Brief, particularly as read by Anthony Heald, is quite good.  Once the reader accepts that Grisham's plots are absurd, these early books are well written with clever characterizations and very enjoyable.  Heald's work is especialy good.  The book is better by far than the movie version.

0385504209|4.0|The DaVinci Code is an exciting, well-paced, and intriguing mystery.  Readers are taken through a whirlwind plot that is chock full of information about Christianity, symbolism, and the Grail.  I picked up this book to see for myself as to whether or not it &quot;debunks&quot; Christianity as so many have claimed.<br />The important idea to remember while reading this book is that it is a work of fiction.  The book is well-researched and is a great mystery.  While some of the facts that Brown includes are true, the story itself is fiction.  Simple as that.  I feel that those who are critical of the novel are afraid...afraid of what they themselves do not know or understand.  I appreciate any work of fiction that compels me to go out and learn MORE--The DaVinci Code does this.  Being secure in your own beliefs is also important in truly enjoying and appreciating this book.<br />Sure, there are some holes in the plot and the &quot;truth&quot; about Sophie's family didn't come as much of a surprise.  I still enjoyed the story because Brown does a wonderful job of describing the historical structures and figures, from DaVinci to Alexander Pope and from the Louvre to Westminster Abbey.<br />So read The DaVinci Code...Enjoy it for what it is--a fascinating and exciting work of fiction that will keep you reading long into the night.
B0000BWVCM|5.0|What a dramatic improvement from the last X-Men movie. This film had a great plot. And while it was much closer to the original comic themed stories, it was still a movie adaptation. I'm not sure why producers, writers, directors, or whoever is responsible feel the need to try and rush several years worth of writing genius into 2 films ..... but they try to anyway.<br />The addition of Nightcrawler was beautifully done. More exploration into Wolverine's character and a slight hint to the arrival of the Pheonix in the near future were tastefully implemented as well. Add in little glimpses of several other characters that are yet to be unveiled, and this was an overall entertaining movie.<br />The second disk is full of histories &amp; backgrounds for the original X-Men comic line and several deleted scenes. Some of which were a waste and some that really could have been left in the film, given there was time available.<br />Overall the DVD is well worth buying and I highly reccomend it to any fan of the original X-Men.
B00007K02F|1.0|While I have great affection for many of Zefferelli's films, mostly his Shakespeare adaptations, this is possibly the worst film he has ever made.  He just does NOT get 'it' about Charlotte Bronte's famous novel - a blonde Rochester?  A brunette Jane? And tall in the bargain?  And NO passion?  Gainsbourg may be a well known actress in her country, but her work here was possibly the most wooden acting by the part of an actress that I have ever seen.  Joan Plowright made a 'fair' Mrs. Fairfax, and Amanda Root was good in the Lowood school section, but mostly this film did NOT offer any improvements on the Timothy Dalton/Zelah Clarke version (the BEST and MOST faithful to the novel) or the Orson Welles/Joan Fontaine version, since Welles and Fontaine embodied the characters of the novel brilliantly, though in a much edited (probably for time in those days) script, like the original black and white Pride and Prejudice with Sir Laurence Olivier and Greer Garson.  However, the Welles/Fontaine version captured the gothic creepiness of the novel better than any other version, while the Dalton/Clarke combines all the elements, including my favorite part of the book, where Rochester embodies the gypsy woman telling fortunes at his home.  <br />Stay away from this one - stick with Dalton/Clarke, Welles/Fontaine, or even the respectable version by Hinds/Morton/A and E (though with anachronistic dialogue, NOT in the book).  Even the Susannah York/George C. Scott one is preferable to this - Scott simply CANNOT give a poor acting performance, and his physicality embodies Rochester, though without the dark, brooding, rugged looks which the book describes him having - as Dalton and Welles DO have, though obviously both are too handsome to be the perfect Rochester.
B0000AXE8I|3.0|The dvd version is good but I truly think that this trilogy was worth watching in the theaters because of the special effects and sound.  For the bonus features, I like the behind-the-scenes look for the freeway scene.  The time and effort the directors, stunt ppl and actors took just makes me appreciate those scenes a lot more.  I also liked how they included the MTV Movie Award Opening.  I didn't give the movie a 5 because, eventhough it's a movie w/ no beginning or ending, it was mainly pure action till the end w/ the Architect.  Character development also dissapeared.  Neo doesn't seem like a guy w/ a lot of emotions.  I'm not saying he should act like how he did in #1 but I didn't like the cold distant look.  He just seemed so artificial in this one.  There are other things that bugged me but to me those are little things that I can look pass by.  It's definetly a trilogy that has to be watched more than once.  And you need patience to look for how they link up together.  I really do think it's at least worth watching.  I've seen worst movies (Legally Blond 2) this year so Matrix Reloaded isn't really all that bad.

B00009XITP|2.0|Considering I don't really like Amanda Bynes, Hilary Duff, or the retched Olsen Twins, this really isn't the kind of movie for me. However, I agreed to see it with my Aunt and little cousin for some fun and a few laughs and that's what I got. But if it wasn't for my Aunt making cracks at the movie I just might have barfed, for this is the kind of film that makes you wonder &quot;Gee, can this story numb my brain any further?&quot; <br />I mean, is there a &quot;Movie Making For Dummies&quot; book that the writers followed or something? Come on, you could have added a little more creativity than this guys. Anyway, maybe if you got stoned you might get a kick out of it but otherwise, you better leave it for the Bynes devotees.

B00003CXWV|5.0|Blow, a Film directed by Ted Demme premiered in 2001 in all theaters. The movie staring Johnny Depp and Penelope Cruz who are both great actors made this movie a success. This movie was based on a true-life story of George Jung and how he became successful over night.  <BR> George Jung was a notorious drug dealer in America. In fact George makes connections with drug lord Pablo Esbar. Esbar was a Columbia drug lord, he is said to be the most dangerous drug dealer ever. George and Esbar are both millionaires when it came to the drug game. <BR> The movie talks about George at a younger age. Georges' father had his own successful construction company. When business was slow for his father, Georges' dad filed for bankruptcy. George Jung at that point decided as a young child, that he always wanted to have money.<BR> George Jung started selling Pot which later turn into him selling Cocaine. He transported Cocaine from Columbia to Holly Wood, California. Blow is a interesting an educational movie. What I mean by educational is it shows you ups and downs of the drug game. The most interesting thing about this movie is trying to figure out weather or not, if George would get caught by the law from selling drugs. <BR>If you haven't seen this film on DVD then now is the time to see it. I gave Blow two thumbs up and so will you.
B0000TB03W|5.0|Shania knows just how to rev up the crowd. From top charting classic hits like You're Still the One and Honey I'm Home to new and sure to be classics songs UP! and In My Car Shania has everyone on there feet start to finish.

B000099T2L|2.0|I really did'nt care for the solo efforts of Miss. Knowles. I think Kelly Rowland has a much better voice. I only found two songs on the cd that I really enjoyed and I listened to the entire cd. She should stick with her group because in my opinion this was a waste of money. As much as cd's cost I expected more than two hits. She's no Alicia Keys. Right now Alicia Keys is the best thing going.

0486282147|4.0|The novel I read is called \\"The Hound of the Baskervilles\\" by Arthur Conan Doyle. I liked this book because of the characters, how the story developed, and how it was written.<br /> The main characters in the book are Sherlock Holmes and Watson. Together they solve the mystery of who killed Sir Charles Baskerville. I think they make a good team because Sherlock does more of the thinking about evidence and theories and Watson goes out and does the leg work of asking questions and gathering information. Even though Sherlock knows the answer to the mystery, he wouldn't be able to do it without Watson and he doesn't act like the superior of the two.<br /> I also liked the book because it was a mystery so the more I read, the more exciting it got as the killer's identity was revealed. I did not know who the killer was or what his motive was until the end.<br /> Finally, I liked the way the author wrote. When Sir Henry was being chased by the hound, I almost felt like it was after me. He had the characters say things like \\"By Jove\\" and \\"Good Heavens\\". Also, instead of writing \\"he said\\" all the time, it was sometimes written as \\"said he\\". Lastly, words would be repeated which I thought made it funny such as: \\"The brute, the brute\\", \\"His wife, His wife\\", and \\"A beard, a beard\\".<br /> In conclusion, I enjoyed this book and agree with those who say that this is one of the best detective stories ever written.
B0000DYJM6|5.0|Lost Dogs is a tremendous compilation from one of the best bands of the modern era.  The great thing about Pearl Jam is that they allow their musical offerings to evolve and change as they mature.  Lost Dogs allows us to listen in on ten years of their evolution.<br />And can we stop the Pearl Jam vs. Nirvana battle going on here?  I personally respect each band for what they are/were.  And I'm sure that if Kurt was alive today, his music would have evolved into something much different than Bleach, Nevermind, and In Utero.  Who would want to listen to 8 albums of the same exact sound?  Dave Grohl didn't.<br />And to trendhitman, who decided to use his reviews as a forum for Pearl Jam bashing, I'll remind you of what you called Pearl Jam in one of your many otherwise worthless reviews of Ten...&quot;One of the most talented and influential bands of the past 10 years.&quot;  I agree.
B0000VCZK2|1.0|At 1:08:58 into the film, the DVD pauses for about 5-10 seconds then jumps backwards several minutes. The short mechanic with the cap had just gotten killed and the crew of the Nostromo is talking about it. Dallas mentions that the ventilation shafts could &quot;work to their advantage&quot;, then a few words later, the DVD falls apart. <br />I exchanged the set for another set, and the exact same thing happened at the exact same spot in the movie! <br />This surely can't be a coincidence. It looks as though a whole batch of these are defective. <br />Has anyone else had this problem? Does anyone own the set, watched the director's cut of Alien, and not had this problem?

B00005AQF7|4.0|This is snoop doggs best album and his new album sucks compared to this one.This is old school rap at its best and dres beats make every song a classic.He used to rap about different things now he only raps about being a pimp.Yeah he is a 100 lb pimp yeah right.Snoop needs to stop selling out by releasing stupid dolls of himself and appearing on commercials.
B0000DD7NL|5.0|Why is it in life that some things seem to come very easy to some people? &quot;The Diary of Alicia Keys&quot; is a case in point. I was going to write about how great the album is. But instead I'm going say this, if you don't own this CD, then you're wasting your time reading this review. Go out and buy the CD, then write a review of your own. Happy listening!!!!!<br />P.S.Track #7-&quot;Diary&quot; and Track #8-&quot;Dragon Days&quot; are getting my full attention at this moment, but that could very well change in the next hour because this entire CD is &quot;THA BOMB&quot;.
B0000DJZA5|3.0|This is something any fan of &quot;Let It Be&quot; should own.  Besides the stripped Spector production, the sound quality is greatly improved and it's nearly impossible to tell that most of the songs are &quot;live in the studio.&quot;  That being said, these are still the mediocre songs from &quot;Let It Be&quot; that The Beatles themselves weren't happy with.  No amount of sound improvement is going to turn something like &quot;For You Blue&quot; into &quot;A Day In the Life.&quot;  It's interesting to hear &quot;The Long and Winding Road&quot; in it's original form, but frankly, I still think the Spector-ized version is more emotional and stronger.  &quot;Across the Universe&quot; benefits from the stripped production, but it still doesn't hold a candle to the pre-Let It Be version (available on Past Masters Vol. 2) before it was slowed down and the female back-up vocalists were removed.<br />Interesting, but in the end it's still &quot;Let It Be,&quot; the low point of the Beatles songwriting.
B0000CAQ27|5.0|Pink has done it AGAIN!!....she has shown she is a recording artist of deep roots and talent.  This CD is a departure from her last album, but make no mistake....it is VERY LISTENABLE.  Tim Armstrong of Rancid (Punk Band) worked with Pink here and there are some very rock oriented songs....but there is enough funk and soul to keep any Pink fan satistied.  GOD IS A DJ....is just off the hook GREAT!   And to any of her detractors, what would you be saying if you got another version of Get This Party Started ?? You would be saying she just re-treaded the past....that's not the case and if anything she has shown she can do it all now....soul,rap, dance and rock....Go Pink!!
B0000DD7NL|5.0|This cd is better than her first.  I especially like track 2 (Karma) this one is really good, but I have to say the whole cd is worth buying.  You can tell she's grown since her last cd.  A little soul, some r&amp;b, a little bit of jazz and a bit of old school, u can't ask for a better mix.  GO GET THE CD.....
B000069AUI|5.0|When i went to Britain earlier this year, i was asked if i knew who Coldplay were. And i told them i didn't, and then cast the band off as some sad pommy music trying to get famous. <br />I got back, and when i turned on the radio, i heard this music. <BR>the lyrics, beat, instruments, the entire music is so beautiful, calming but at the same time so fun to listen to. i dont know exactly how to describe their style, but i know why they're such a hit, and especially why no one in this forum area has reveiwed it any less than 4 stars.
B00009TB5G|2.0|Well, as I suspected upon watching this in the theater, this movie reveals the lack of appreciation amongst the director and cast for Tolkien's books. At several places they mention how little they think about the way Tolkien developed this or that character or plot element. They completely misunderstand what Tolkien was saying about Faramir's character, and where they do retreat to an almost-Tolkienian love story between Aragorn and Arwen, they admit that this was after trying to make Arwen into a warrior and failing.<br />The movie is entertaining, and the casting, staging and effects are superb. It's just a shame they decided not to make Tolkien's story into a movie. This one is along the lines of &quot;inspired by&quot; fluff.
B0000DJZA5|4.0|The Beatles had and have written much about how disappointed they were and are with the original \\"Let It Be\\" album. The feelings were adequately summed up by Lennon when he said \\"I was surprised. When I heard it I didn't puke!\\"<br />The Beatles have now drifted into legend. Half of the group are no longer with us, but each new generation seems to rediscover the group with unbelievable ease (I was born the year the \\"Let It Be\\" sessions were recorded, and the Beatles nonetheless comprised a huge part of the attention of my teenage years despite the fact they hadn't recorded a note in almost fifteen years and Lennon had been dead almost ten years). The original \\"Let It Be\\" album always stood as one of the group's weakest efforts, which isn't to say that it's a bad album, it's just not as strong as the rest of their catalogue. Nonetheless, the album was released, sold the usual millions, and is now almost an archetype in the minds of Beatles' fans, warts and all. Releasing a re-mix is then a challenge from the get-go.<br />[...]Still, this release is interesting. It's by no means a necessary purchase, but it is intriguing listening to the bared-down cuts of \\"The Long And Winding Road\\", \\"Across The Universe\\" and \\"Let It Be\\". More of the Beatles themselves come out in these versions, much of which was lost in the famous or infamous \\"wall of sound\\" of the original versions.<br />\\"Across the Universe\\" probably fares best of all the re-mixes. This mix reveals the true beauty of the song bared down to acoustic guitar and John Lennon's vocals (the 1968 backing vocals have been completely removed). The version of \\"I Me Mine\\" also rocks harder here; the original version was more pretty than gritty. This one is more gritty and powerful. Removing the chatter, tuning, and warming up from the rooftop concert tracks was probably not a great move. It ruins the spontaneity and fun of the recording session that was so evident on the original.<br />The \\"bonus CD\\" is interesting, but it probably won't stand up to repeated listenings. Some of the audio and music from the \\"Let It Be\\" movie can clearly be heard (Paul's great piano piece that marks the beginning of the movie is happily included here). A better bonus CD would have been the entire rooftop concert as seen in the \\"Let It Be\\" movie (which was almost impossible to find even on VHS, and is still difficult to come across) and would have increased sales exponentially by labeling it \\"The Beatles' Last Live Concert Now Officially Available For The First Time!\\"<br />Lastly, why the corny title? People who don't know any better could pick it up and say \\"What's this? An homage to nudity?\\" Not to mention that it's misleading. Many of the tracks are not \\"naked\\" but simply remixed. Also, the removal of a lot of the spontaneous studio chatter that permeates the original album makes this album feel more polished, not more stripped down. Apart from the Spectorization of certain tracks, the original recording sounds and feels more \\"naked\\" by comparison. A more apt title might have been \\"Let It Be... Cleaned Up\\". It never will in no way replace or push aside the original album (it was likely not meant to anyway).<br />In the end, the Beatles are one of the few very bands in rock history that would be deemed worthy of such treatment (i.e., re-releasing and remixing an album some 35 years after its original release). The fact that this CD set exists speaks volumes of their longevity and the quality of the music they produced during their brief reign as pop's biggest band.tand up to repeated listenings.

B00005QZWI|5.0|&quot;The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring Sdtk.&quot; is one of the most amazing movie score compilations recorded.  Such intense orchestral music drives deep into everyone's hearts.  The scary music gives the specific movie scenes their added edge.  They make the chase and dark scenes much more intense.  The lyrics, &quot;evil, dark evil....horror, dark horror&quot; are sung by the choir amazingly, adding their own taste to those scenes.  The bright music adds light to the beautiful scenes.  Such beautiful sounds make the waterfall more lively, the Shire more cheerful, and Frodo's awakening after having been stabbed more miraculous.  This CD alone offers an accurate taste of the movie's theme.  Its mass quality deserved Howard Shore the Oscar win for Best Original Score for 2001.  Enya's performances of &quot;The Council of Elrond&quot; and &quot;May It Be&quot; are amazing.  Such quality deserved her the Oscar nomination for Best Original Song for &quot;May It Be&quot;, heard in the movie's end credits.  &quot;The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring Sdtk.&quot; is worth buying.  Many listeners will continue listening to these tracks for a long time.  Many of these tracks will be classics like what &quot;The Godfather&quot; is now.  They are and always will symbolize the movie.  These songs are a wonderful way to do that.
B0000DD7NL|5.0|I've always thought that it's gonna be hard to follow up a debut like Alicia's but with &quot;The Diary of Alicia Keys&quot; she has proven herself to be in a class of her own. It is more mature and a great follow up to &quot;Songs in A minor&quot;. Love the whole album but &quot;You don't know my name&quot;, &quot;So simple&quot; and &quot;When you really love someone&quot; are my absolute favourites. Way to go!
B00001U0DP|5.0|&quot;Life Is Beautiful&quot; is one of the best movies released in 1998.  It received seven Oscar nominations and three rightful wins: Best Foreign Film, Best Original Score, and Best Actor(Roberto Benigni).  Its plot is brilliant.  Such chain of events rarely fit as one credible movie.  Benigni's writing brilliance makes everything fit.  Amazingly, the plot takes a severe historic tragedy and offers more hope of survival, namely Guido telling his son that this is a game of trying to win the tank.  Though nothing about The Holocaust was good, this accurately desplicts the trials of its victims.  The movie combines tragedy, magic, and love.  The acting is wonderful.  Everyone pours their heart and soul through their characters.  Their previous research about the real-life victims shines through every scene.  Such rough emotions are never held back for a second.  The set and the costume designs were manufactured wonderfully.  They accurately desplict the styles of 1939-1945.  The elaborate settings give the added magical or tragic vibe, depending on the individual scene.  &quot;Life Is Beautiful&quot; is a great movie for those looking for a unique, powerful drama.  The italian version is much better than the english version.  The english version takes away much of the intended emotion.  This movie will rightfully become a classic in the near following years.

B000055ZDT|4.0|&quot;When you get into one of these groups, there's only a couple of<br />ways you can get out. One, is death; the other, is mental institutions.&quot;<br />Absolutely awesome doom, and I'm not even a doom fan...at least not until I heard this! The album kicks in with the hypnotic bashing of Vinum Sabbathi, veering off into the three part solar psychedelia of &quot;Weird Tales&quot;--one of the best tracks on the CD, besides &quot;I, the Witchfinder.&quot; I recommend this highly. It's unfortunate that their latest album, &quot;Let us Prey&quot; is so substandard--in general and in comparison-- to the mighty DOPETHRONE. DOPETHRONE is dynamic, creative, and focused. And, if you listen closely, you can hear a bong gurgling under the maelstrom of guitar/drums/bass.<br />&quot;You see man as a rather dismal creature.&quot; &quot;Yes. Why not? Look around...you'll see what's there. Fear, and frightened people who kill what they can't understand.&quot;<br />Yes. The musical equivalent of Eldritch horror.
B0000DJZA5|3.0|I saw this advertised,and thought WOW! ,like the CD was different<BR>cuts of those great songs. Nope. I must say by reading the liner notes, it is a very clear,pleasant sounding &quot;remix&quot;. &quot;The Long and winding Road&quot;,sounded wonderful! The second disk I really was<BR>not impressed with. But I say listening to the Beatles as long as I have,buy it! I did compare my Let it Be cd to this and sure enough<BR>it was pleasant to the ears!
B00005JM02|5.0|This was a wonderful movie, geared as it was towards younger watchers. There was no added in adult humour to attract an older audience, because that simply wasn't necessary. In this day and age a really children-themed movie is very rare, and this one carries the day with its memorable well developed characters and original plot. This isn't just, as most new disney movies are, a rehashing of an old plot, or a sequel to play off of the popularity of a previous hit, but it was a refreshingly new idea with amazing digital animation.
B0000TB03W|5.0|A great buy for the shania fan. Shania performing after almost a 3 year break. Shania always has fun singing in front if the crowd and it shows. Shania get the crowd to sing along. The editing of this dvd could have been better. It's just that somethimes the costume changes don't quite flow natually and stuff like that. but it's still an extremly entertaining dvd. Certainly a must for any Shania fan.

B000002GK1|5.0|I recently bought this album because my brother who has been a longtime Soundgarden fan told me it was amazing.  My favorite bands include Lamb of God, Meshuggah, Burnt By the Sun, Dillinger Escape Plan, etc... so I bought it thinking it would be a good classic to have however it wouldn't be in my cd player everyday.  I was wrong.  This cd is absolutely amazing.  I can't believe people were doing this in 1991... songs like Face Pollution and Jesus Christ Pose are easily as technical as any Dillinger or Meshuggah song and at the same time heavy as hell.  As far as Chris Cornell goes... he has never done anything like this again and never will.  Great riffs, vocals, songwriting, drumming, drumming, and did I mention drumming make this a must own classic.
B000003TA4|5.0|Ah, the celebrated Nevermind.

They are all, (in my mind), somewhat incorrect.<br />Nevermind is obviously the most popular Nirvana CD, as many of its' songs made it into the rock charts of that era.  It was a good cd though.<br />Pros<BR>-Creative lyrics<BR>-A &quot;heavier&quot; sound<BR>-Dark melodies and creative lines that i would never of thought<BR>-Plain heaviness and coolness, with the underground feel (whoa there, i only said feel, not that it is underground).<br />Cons<BR>-Everyone has it (you are not special to own this cd)<BR>-Rather inconclusive guitar playing (ah, i guess this is what made it grunge . . .)<br />All in all, good stuff.<BR>Then again, maybe not so good stuff.<BR>But for the 90's junkie, good start (or finish).
1558216847|5.0|I would like to add another voice to the &quot;fake/nonfake&quot; debate, especially because The Long Walk is truly an important historical contribution to WWII testimonies, and one that does not deserve to be discounted for its seemingly unbelievable tale.  The trek from Siberia, which was made by many Poles who were captured in the late 1930s and early 1940s, is a well-documented phenomenon, and one might consider looking into further scholarship on the Polish Free Army if this book caught your interest.  Their paths were not identical, but many of them ended up in the middle-east where they were later trained as combat soldiers or paratroopers by the British (particularly in Iraq).  There are several documentary films that have been made on this trek, with supporting evidence, but the problem remains that most of them are in Polish.  Moreover, the deeds of these Polish officers and soldiers are often passed over in favor of the stories of the official victors (America, Britain, France, Russia) or their victims (Japan, Germany).  <br />The historical phenomenon is by no means false or untrue.  I have interviewed too many survivors of these treks from Siberia and seen too much supporting documentation not to believe that these events occured.<br />That said, when reading any &quot;survivor&quot; account, one must keep in mind that memory itself is a construct that is pressured by several factors: duress, psychological state of mind, hunger and hallucination, the passage of time, loss of mnemonic capability as one ages, and political/historical/religious world view.  No memory is &quot;truth,&quot; per se, but the manner in which it is remembered tells us something about the event and the person who endured it.  One must also keep in mind that &quot;survival&quot; has proven itself capable throughout history of inspiring deeds that seem unimaginable, and just because a story seems fantastical does not mean that it is fake.  After all, this book is about the &quot;memory of a long walk&quot; and not a &quot;nothing but the facts&quot; account of a historical act.  It is one man's story, which has immediate cultural, historical, and personal implications.  <br />Denial of the historical merit (and honesty) of this book is truly a shame, and a step backwards in understanding the experience of Polish detainees during WWII, a generally forgotten history in the first place.  I would encourage those with an interest in WWII to add this book to your shelf.  This experience seriously scarred many of the men who endured (and survived) it.  Their memory deserves our respect and not our denial of their suffering.
B0000027RL|5.0|Well, well, Pearl Jam's Ten, the most positively reviewed album from their massive entourage.  Ten is a good cd.<br />Heaven<BR>-Good, good, GOOD lyrics and songwriting<BR>-You can really feel the pain (or fake pain, depending on your viewpoint)<BR>-Darkness and heaviness complete the package<br />Hell (uh, not too much to say here)<BR>-Kinda cheesy if taken to heart and analyzed<BR>-Voice gets kinda annoying after a while<br />I don't like to take sides, it only separates good people.<BR>I recommend this album, but be wary, it might not be what you expect.<BR>Good addition to 90's collection.
B0000DD7NL|4.0|Real rating of 4.5 because I couldn't get into a couple of the cuts but I got Alicia's cd/dvd yesterday and love it!<br />Favs are Heartburn, If I Was Your Woman (great remake), You Don't Know My Name, If I Ain't Got You (will undoubtably be a classic in years to come), Diary, Wake Up, So Simple, When You Really Love Someone, Feeling U, Feeling Me, Harlem's Nocturn, Slow Down & Nobody Not Really.<br />Feeling the beat on but have to grow on me: Karma & Dragon Days.<br />Some people really don't like r&b and that accounts for some of the ridiculous reviews I've read giving this disc 1 or 2 stars. I think it's great that Alicia & Musiq both declared a love for the sound of 70's music and have incorporated those sounds in their music.<br />I think that a lot of reviewers stating that she used too many samples either did not buy the disc or are repeating what they have heard others say because according to my liner notes, she only used samples on 2 songs: If I Was Your Woman/Walk on By and You Don't Know My Name.<br />I think that given time and the opportunity to grow as a musician, Alicia will continue to make her musical mark on the world. I also love the dvd addition as it gives insight to her world and how she went about writing this disc. I would seriously recommend it to anyone who truly enjoys r&b - this disc was one of the top 3 released of 2003.
B0000DD7NL|5.0|This girl never disappoints me ever. This girl is truley talented, and the songs are crazy hot. There is truley no sophmore jinx here. I think that the younger and older people will be  VERY happy with the sucess of this album. This is a cd that everyone should go and buy and rock to. Good job Miss Keys, My girl has did it again. Excellent album. Alicia keys is truley a very talented  singer/entertainer.
B0000DZEA1|5.0|I have enjoyed Shore's music with FOTR and TTT. ROTK pretty much keeps to expectations and stands on its own. I could almost smell the action as I heard the music - Shelob's Lair really has an Ungoliant feel and had me on edge, The White Tree is regal on a grand scale, and Cirith Ungol dark! Like a master magician Shore has weaved another brilliant tapestry deftly using themes from the grand scheme of LOTR to keep this album vibrant and smooth. Lennox, though good, just does not provide the climactic finale as did May It Be, or Gollum's Song.
B0000VCZK2|5.0|It is my opinion that Alien and Aliens were the definitive films of the series and like James Cameron says in his interview, the next two films were an alternate universe. 4 stars for the whole collection if it weren't for the presence of Alien and Aliens, and the 44 hours of extras more than makes up for a super disappointing third installment in this series. I didn't mind the extended/ alternate versions of Alien 3 or Alien: Resurrection either, but neither feel like they belong with two of the greatest sci-fi films ever made (the first two films of course).<br />Buy this DVD set, you won't regret it.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I just bought this from my local Best Buy, they had it early :-)  Anyway, the set itself is put together like the Boxed Sets of 'King Of The Hill', 'Futurama' and 'Family Guy', NOT like the Buffy, Angel, and Simpsons Boxed Sets.  It's got the slimline DVD cases in a cardboard slipcase.  The picture and sound quality ROCKS and is presented in Anamorphic Widescreen.  It includes 3 episodes that FOX never aired (STUPID!!) and bloopers (which I love). The show is the perfect mix of sci-fi, comedy, suspense, and drama (like you'd expect from Joss Whedon, creator of Buffy & Angel and writer of Alien: Resurrection)  I can only hope that when the upcoming movie comes out, FOX kicks itself for cancelling such a great show!  I blame FOX for not giving the show a chance, the promos they created for it did NOT do this show justice, this is NOT a space-western!!!  FOX, hopefully the sales figures of your TV DVDs have shown you that you've cancelled some very popular shows: Firefly, Futurama, and most of all, FAMILY GUY!!!

B0000TB03W|5.0|Order this excellent DVD of Shania Up Live In Chicago and if you want you can see the best show every night. It is an excellent quailty DVD with the best sounds you could want from the Queen of Country music Shania. Her and her husbands song writing ability comes through in the new songs but what really makes this DVD is Shania and her ability to sing with the grace of the morning lark and the up most in beauty. She will sing her way into the hardest of hearts. This DVD is all and completely Shania and for her fans.
B0000DBJDM|5.0|i saw this years ago when i was younger and easily blown away by stuff for one reason or another, but i just got this dvd and it's still awesome!<BR>     the director's cut is a little incongruous what with the planets and rockets and stuff, but the interviews are great. needless to say, the original film is where it's at, it just captures an atmosphere that's pretty damned amazing. for example the first shot in echoes where it zooms in really slowly, it's so simple yet is just mesmerizing. the director's cut breaks up this long shot, which really sucks so it's one good reason among many that they have the original.<BR>     i've heard so many people say that pink floyd sucks live because it's just four guys standing around with their hair in their faces, and that's essentially what they do in this video, but that's the whole point i think, that four guys just standing around can exhude so much intensity and emotion just by being so into the music and their environment. it just shows that music isn't just about sight and sound, it's about atmosphere...
B0000TB03W|5.0|Shania has such a soomth, soft voice that is very beautiful. There are none like it today. In this DVD her voice is the best and it seems like she may even be able to get better. For the ones who truely love Shania for her talent this is the DVD to get. It is a showcase of her ability to sing.
B000089CJI|4.0|Am I the only one who thinks Ben Gibbard sounds like Ian Broudie's little brother?  For that matter, the whole album sounds the best album The Lightning Seeds never recorded.  Many comparisons here to Depeche Mode, but Tears for Fears debut &quot;The Hurting&quot; may be more accurate.  Whatever.  Shoegazer is back, so why not Brit Pop.  All you 30-somethings that left the music scene, alienated and alone, get back in the game.  This is the CD for you.  And bring your kids.
B0000TB03W|5.0|Have you ever seen Shania live in concert? I have not seen her live either but I will tell you this the DVD is the very next best thing to seeing her live. It is clear has excellent sound and no commericals. You can see Shania from every camera view without looking through over or around anyones head. You can hear without all the other noise at a live concert. You can really enjoy what you are seeing and hearing. This DVD is the very best next thing to seeing Shania live on stage.
B00003CX8Y|5.0|Tales as old as time..... This is a all time favourite that cartoon fans should possess. Not only the movie is the only animation movie nominated for Oscar BEST PICTURE, the movie theme song 'Beauty and The Beast' was and is still all time favourite love song [by Celine Dion and Peabo Bryson]. I admit that I am a Celine's fan. But, putting away this, I think this animation movie worth to be placed on your DVD, VCD or VHS collection cupboard.
B0000TB03W|5.0|Have you got a boy/girlfriend, husband/wife, brother/sister, best friend then you now have the best present to get anyone of them for x-mas and that is Shania Up live in Chicago on DVD. There is no better CD/DVD by Shania then this one. It has a good combination of hits and new to make the Shania lover happy. So if you want to impress those closest to you get them this DVD and they will love you forever.

B0000TB03W|5.0|Shania is like her favorite flower on stage the &quot;wild rose&quot;. She changes from a quite person to one who is all over the stage. In this DVD you get to see the other side of Shania and that is the one of a women alive in her music and her voice is just outstanding. The new songs are fun and serious but done with only the excellent voice that Shania could bring to them.
0448060191|4.0|Little Women was a fantastic book. It's a story about the life of the four March sisters, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy. The girls and their mother are very close. Mr. March is away in the Civil War. The book tells of the adventures of the girls as they grow up. It tells of their poverty and how they shouldn't take anything for granted. It shares stories of bad moments in their lives. A teacher hit Amy as a punishment therefore causing and uprising. The girls mother then pulls them out of school. It tells of their love lives and the conflicts between Laurie and the sisters. They also try to find a happy medium of good and bad. They want to be bad and do mischivous things, but need to be the proper ladies that they are expected to be. They spend their lives trying to balance the two ideas. They try to learn the difference between dreams and reality. They dream of a life of riches, where they get everything they want. But in reality, they are not even close. They try, throughout the whole story, to be good sisters to one another. They also try to be good to their mother, since she is struggling while her husband is away. At Christmas, the girls planned on buying eachother and themselves gifts. Later, that changed to buying presents for their mother to show her how much they appreciate her hard work and love. The author, Alcott, portrays they life and society during the civil war superbly. This book is good for boys and girls of all ages because everyone can learn something from it, wether its about love, lust, money, pride, education, or anything else. This book shows us the reality of life. It deserves all five stars, if not more.
0060977493|5.0|So many aspects of this novel are exquisite. Firstly, the language and style itself; Ms. Roy enthuses her story with a lyricism which draws on and enlarges the richness of the English language; the repetition enhances the sense of the story's inevitability, while the conning of new phrases and the unusual combinations of words and sounds fleshes out the internal worlds of the central characters. The way in which the author refers to the central events in epic terms also brings home the scale of the tragedy that afflicts this otherwise ordinary family.<br />Though others here have decried the way in which the novel shuttles from past to present to future and back again, any attentive reader cannot fail to discern the care with which this structuring has been made. In order to fully grasp the central tragedy, we must understand as deeply as possible the characters of Ammu, Rahel anbd Estha, and this is why Ms Roy shows us everything before she reaches the pivotal moment of the story. The very final word - 'tomorrow' - is a powerfully simple and yet moving comclusion to the story; we know exactly what will happen tomorrow, we know exactly how the characters will deal with and be influenced by the events of tomorrow, but we are left at the brink of the tragedy so we can savour at once the rapture of the Ammu's love for Velutha and the grief of the tragedy it leads to.<br />The story is a simple one, and deliberately so; Roy does not intend to present us with a complex story, but instead wishes to explore every aspect of one straightforward tale, to examine the characters and motives of all the characters involved. The joy of the God of Small Things is not in any elaboration of plot, but in the intricate manner in which the author unfolds this simple story for us so that we see the vast richness of human experience contained in even the most humdrum of domestic tales.<br />The structure of the novel also lends it tremendous suspense; as we move torward the central event,Roy leads us closer and closer to realising what happens, without revealing all until the very end. At the same time, as she describes more and more about the subsequent lives of the characters, she further stokes our desire to know exactly what happened and why their lives turned out so. Moreover, our growing affection for Ammu, Estha and Rahel makes the sense of impending doom all the harder to accept. This is a very dramatic dynamic.<br />The children are not shown to be wise-beyond-their-years, as one reviewer has claimed; but they are shown to be in possession of the full range of human emotion. They are not belittled by Ms Roy; they are as completely involved in the story as their adult relatives. Their understanding of the situation they find themselves in and their reaction to that situation, as well as their motives and biases, are as important in deciding the outcome of the story as are those of the adult characters of the novel, and in this Ms roy demonstrates clear and unsentimental insight into the complex and subtle workings of family. <br />Incredible.
0380789035|1.0|I bought this book when it first came out. I was at the airport and I was travelling cross country and had lots of time on my hands. I gave this book a  really good try but it was so incredibly boring, depressing, and frankly disgusting that I ended up throwing the book in a trashcan at the airport.. something I have never ever done. I didn't even want to pass it on to anyone in the event they might enjoy it even though I hadn't. It was just THAT bad.<br />At the time I bought it, it hadn't won any awards. In fact, as I was browsing Amazon, I was shocked to see the rating this  has book acquired. I just did not find a man consumed by a prostitute, in a very disturbing manner, all that entertaining (I won't describe it beyond that because I want to keep this review clean). It was, quite simply, gross. The story is depressing, too. Blech. It's just a loser.<br />I am an avid reader and I treasure books. This was not worth the paper it was printed on.
B00005QGAZ|5.0|Thriller is a classic, one of the ten best albums of all time -- and that's even though I have a severely negative view of the singer personally for reasons we've all read of.<br />The additions are hardly essential, but they are interesting. The interviews are informative, especially explaining why Carousel was booted from the LP (a choice that makes sense after Q describes why). The Vincent Price &quot;rap&quot; is a hoot. I think the Billie Jean demo is a throwaway, being so incomplete, but others disagree. Someone In The Dark I really like... and it *is* complete to my ears. (It's, per a source I located, longer than one of the two versions released on the ET Storybook, barely so, though I have no clue if this is that version or an edit of some sort.) And as for Carousel... yes, including a severely edited version on the CD is incomprehensible. The full version has a chorus that is probably too repetitive, but why cut out a verse? That said, the full version of Carousel *is* available in MP3 format at MichaelSembello.com.
B0000C9ZLD|2.0|I am desparately trying to love this group.  Every magazine I pick up has their pictures on the cover, and I keep reading that they are the coolest band on the planet.  Cool guys.  I want to be cool to, so I bought the disc.  I adored the first disk; a pop classic.  I play it constantly.  The difference between the first and second disc, is that they made the mistake of opening the music up for individual playing, a big mistake.  These guys really can't play their instruments very well.  The guitar players talk about some guy teaching them how to solo after they got in the band.  Aren't you supposed to learn that first?  But these guys are cool.  The bass player cuts his own hair and plays simplistic bass lines.  He's cool too.  The drummer, who drums along competantly, lives with Drew, so you know he's cool.  The singer is great, though.  I love the way this guys screams.  He is one of my favorites.  He doesn't look like a screamer, but I would love to see him live.  His writing on this disc is another story.  The first 2 songs belong on the first disc, they are that good.  Then this disc falls into a valley of boring, dull, hookless, shapeless, muddy drivel.  The first 2 songs sound like the sound of this band, the rest is their attempt to move on and sound kind of different, and I hope they don't move on to this the next time.  This is like the Cars second album, not even close to the first one.  They seemed to exhaust the style of the first two discs, and so has this band.  The rest of the songs from song 3 to the end sound like mud.  Really poor writing, Mr. Julian.  I keep reading about how everytime one of these band members make a move, they need a beer in their hand.  Julian must have been drunk when he wrote this mush.  Oh, also, bands that drink and drug, (oh, and also smoke) aren't cool in '03.  That guy with the cigarette hanging from his mouth looks really out of touch with the fact that smoking is totally out of style.  Not cool at all.  In fact, he looks like he's in a band from the 60's.  He looks moronic.  Maybe these guys aren't that cool after all.  Also, stop taking pictures and start learning how to play your instruments. I think this band is becomming a media creation, kind of like the Monkees.    The real star of this band is the Whiz Kid.  Anybody who can get a band like this as much publicity as they have, is a genius.  Imagaine, a mediocre band being  hailed as the second coming of the Beatles.  Changing Rock music forever.  The Whiz Kid is the man of the year.
B000089RVR|4.0|This is the album for the woebegone, the heartbroken, and the insomniac. If you enjoyed Dido's previous effort, &quot;No Angel,&quot; I trust you'll find this similarly engaging along the same &quot;Is it pop or synth-folk?&quot; lines. Ultimately, who cares? It's a good listen.<br />Production here (once again) is key. Thank Dido's brother (Rollo) for pulsing each track with the common thread of ethereal otherworldliness. Yes, it's been done, and no, it doesn't challenge very many boundaries musically, but it IS cohesive as an album (increasingly rare today) and qualifies as daring (*winces*) when one considers the landscape of pop music.<br />A few interesting points:<br />Keep listening after &quot;See the Sun.&quot; There's a bonus track about three minutes after it ends.<br />&quot;See the Sun&quot; (track 11) is a good tune, and it's the only one on which Dido is credited solely as songwriter.<br />Start with tracks 1 and 3 on repeat, and then move on. The best tracks here are 5 (&quot;See You When You're 40&quot;--any cynic will die laughing midverse) and 2 (&quot;Stoned&quot;--now an incredible club remix as well).<br />Enjoy!
B0000VCZK2|1.0|I was going to buy this till i saw how cheaply made the package is. It will scratch up fast if it is not already scratched from shipping in this cheap carton. Fox needs to look at parmounnt's indiana jones set to see how to put a box togetther, it has reguler keepcases and a nice box to go with it,Even the Godfather collection was packaged better then this, my advice wait till Jaunaury and purchase the movies seperetly and send fox a message. The only bad thing is you won't be able to get the 9th bonus disc.
B00005JMF6|5.0|I couldn't stop jumping at every little thing.  It was a suspense thriller that gives you big surprises.  I never expected what happened at the end and the dead girl in the movie scared the crap out of me!  I can't wait for this movie to come out on DVD because it was such a great movie.
B00005JM0B|1.0|I might consider it just to make a loud noise with my sub woofer. Otherwise all I can say I already got suckered in at the theatre and once is enough. Might rent it if I was really bored. This movie is just plain bad. Bad plot..Bad acting....Real bad ending. The terminator should have stayed terminated.
0783229526|4.0|&quot;Eyes glazed insanely behind tiny gold rim greaser shades.&quot; So goes one of my favorite lines in a book recommended to me by a buddy named Douglas Mallach (we call him Doug Mallach for short), an Irish name to be sure and thus the literary sensibility. For anybody who hasn't read Hunter's famous story of excess and depravity in the once desolate and simultaneously luxurious oddity known as Las Vegas, this is a quick read and one perfectly suited for road trips and travel. Though be careful if you're flying by air. Others will hear you laugh out loud. <BR>In spite of its wit and borderline sanity, the author has one eye on history. As my friend Doug pointed out, he's writing at the time when liberalism in this country hit its &quot;high water mark.&quot; There's a sensitivity to the forces behind culture that moves this book as much as its characters' ridiculous predicaments. <BR>I think the movie hits the book on the head (I'll blame that on Doug Mallach). Gilliam is right man for the job. With tilted angles, wide angle closeups, and some special effects work (though you little not realize it) he manages to put his audience in that state of catatonia that befalls not a vegetable but a truly well baked mind. So where the book is frenetic, the movie is a trip. One very worth taking. In fact why not do both?!
B0000CDLA7|2.0|don't get this CD. Nothing grabbed me. I've listened to and been a fan of DT since '92. I've seen them on every tour, sometimes multiple times per tour. I can appreciate the artistic endeavor, and I can't fault them for doing the music they want, but I just don't care for the writing on this album. The musicianship is nothing short of stunning, but who cares if the song isn't worth listening to in the first place. <br />Jordan's performances were great. His restraint and new sounds worked well. James's performance is also quite good. Those were the two bright spots on the album for me.<br />I was so disappointed in this cd that I gave it away. I hope it is appreciated more by the new owner. I'm passing on this tour. Sorry guys. I just don't think this is your best effort to date. In fact, I liked Falling into Infinity more.
B0000029DD|5.0|After hearing endless praise for the late Jeff Buckley's album Grace, I finally decided to buy it and hear what all the ruckus was about.  Got home, popped it in my discman, and for the hour or so that this album lasts, I didn't know how to make sense of anything I was hearing.  At the end of the closer, \\"Dream Brother\\", I just sat there, stunned, not being able to fully comprehend what I had just listened to.  This is one of the best albums ever recorded, and definitely in the top 5 best albums of the 90's.  Buckley's angelic, passionate voice (good lord, he could sing) and his knack for transcendental songwriting make the music on this record unbelievable to listen to.  None of the chord progressions and such are revolutionary by any means, but the way the songs are arranged is very interesting and somewhat unusual.  It seems on first listen that the album has very little continuity, since Buckley will often jump from hard rocker to soft ballad at a moment's notice.  However, upon completion of the album, the whole vision is realized by the listener, and everything makes sense and flows quite well.  Mojo Pin is a great opener for an album, setting a somewhat dreamlike introductory mood.  Then, without notice, it makes left turns into a series of cacophonous, guitar-shredding climaxes that help thrust Buckley's vocal range into castrato levels, letting you know that this isn't some typical mid-90's whine-rocker.  This man could SING.  And with PASSION (something that his father Tim and many other classic rockers seemed to understand, but something that 99% of modern rock has NONE of).  The title track's uplifting verse riff is about the catchiest and most contagious thing I've ever heard, and Last Goodbye's bass riff sounds strangely like Phish's \\"Sample in a Jar\\", which is nice.  Last Goodbye showcases the incredible production on this record.  Just listen to the way the accoustic guitar strumming flows alongside the ride cymbal.  Pure sonic perfection.  Other highlights include a BEAUTIFUL cover of Leonard Cohen's \\"Hallelujah\\" and the album's middle-eastern-influenced closer, Dream Brother.  This is one of those records that is bliss from start to end, and I love the album more and more every time I listen to it.  Unfortunately, this is the only actual studio album that Buckley ever released (released in '94, three years before he died in an accidental drowning).  If he was still with us, this masterpiece may have been a mere stepping stone in a potentially expansive, progressive, and brilliant musical career.  After having this album completely blow my mind, I'm a converted fan.  Funny how I always catch on to brilliant music years after the artist has either died or faded from the spotlight (I started listening to Pearl Jam, my now favorite band, around 1999).  If you are a fan of brilliant, beautiful music, buy this record as soon as you can.  RIP, Jeff.
B000001EL3|2.0|I use to love kiss till i got into real music.Now they to me are a joke.This album is there best and i only give it 2 stars.Why you ask?Well punching out power chords all the time is boring.The song writing is not good at all.Aces solos a 5 year old can do.he bends the same string 14 times.The songs chorus never ends, half of most of the songs are just repeated lyrics.But i like a few songs so thats why i give it 2 stars.if your 18 dont buy this album.If your 5 up to 17 you mite like it.
B00006L7XQ|5.0|I truly enjoyed this CD. Not pretty music. Some of the songs have a real edge on them. But listening to Johnny Cash cover some old American classic songs and also some newer songs has been a delight for me.
0316666343|5.0|My amazement about this novel is how well it was written.  Throughout I did not feel a bit of vengeance or meanness from this young girl that was brutally taken from this earth.  Is this what heaven is like?<br />Suzie, this wonderful character, watches the lives of the ones she loves and the one that was brutal to her.  She watches as her family and friends cope with her death the best way they knew how.  This book seemed so real and tangible even though it was fiction.  I really like that about this novel.<br />My favorite part (I must add this in my review) is when she had a chance to return.  What would you do if you were dead and had a chance to go back?  She did something so unexpected.  I would have told who killed me.  I would have pointed him out and seeked my vengeance, but not Suzie, this character that scales on fictional perfection.  She sought love.  She sought her heart, and I thought that was amazing.  She let her killer be and didn't even worry about it.  That's how strong love is in this book.<br />Alice Sebold has created a major achievement in fiction novels.  I have never read anything so compelling and fresh and painful.  I recommend buying this book if you believe in the great side of human nature (dead or alive), and the love you carry beyond life into death.  Wonderful.  Wonderful.  Enjoy.<br />Joy
B00005JLT5|5.0|I'll preface this by saying that a) I have studied the Holocaust quite a bit, particularly in relation to the modern media, and b) I am not Jewish, and feel that I therefore can never have a full understanding of the Shoah and its implications. That being said, this is probably the best drama that I have seen about the period. <BR>  It drives me to distraction to hear people say that this film is \\"slow\\", \\"not engaging\\", or \\"unemotional.\\" Those who think this is slow should probably not even be watching it, because they clearly don't have the capacity to even attempt to glean insight into the Shoah (which is of course, impossible for anyone but survivors to understand, as Primo Levy said). This is not a subject that should be trimly packaged to pander to American's ridiculous attention spans. This is not a long film. I shudder to think what people who say this is long would say in response to Lanzmann's \\"Shoah.\\" Those who find that it is not engaging are not seeing the exuisite subtlety of the film. Adrien Brody's performance is absolutely beyond description, and probably beyond the abilities of 90% of today's actors. All I can say is that this film is driven (particularly in the second half) almost entirely by his eyes and the way he moves, down to the finest detail. It could be missed if you are not paying this film the rapt attention it deserves. As far as this film being unemotional, I'd say that it is mercifully and tastefully lacking in pathos. If you need a director or an orcestra to tell you how to feel, watch Schindler's List, it's perfect for you. Spielberg is more than happy to help you avoid all that mental and emotional work, and to tell you when to cry and when to stop. <BR>Another aspect of this film that makes it all the more deserving of the cultural-icon status that Schindler's List occupies in America is that it does not attempt to gather up the entire Shoah into 2.5 hours. Polanski isn't trying to tell the whole story, which shows a great deal ofhumility where Spielberg shows hubris. Without denying that film is, intrinsically, pop culture, this film is something beyond pop and marketing (this mentality is so sadly lacking, particularly in the currently climate of the Bush regime). When I first went to see this film, I had zero expectations, other than supposing that Adrien Brody would perform well. I hadn't \\"prepared\\" myself for it at all. Within five minutes, I was absolutely alone in that theater with this movie (figuratively). I found myself crying throughout the film because I was so moved by Brody's performance. I could rhapsodize about this film for much longer, but I'll try to be more succinct. This is *the* drama (though it is a true story, and an equally laudable book) to see about the event. There are documentaries (Night and Fog, and again, Shoah) that should not be missed, either, but this is a good example of how best to portray these events for mass audiences. I can only hope that this will be shown in schools sometime in the near future as a learning tool, and thus give young adults a more healthy viewpoint than they get from the usual suspects - Schindler's List and Life Is Beautiful. If you are able to read German, I highly recommend reading the article \\"Die Seele In System\\" by Georg Seesslen, which is archived at the website [...] It offers even more reasons why The Pianist is a uniquely valuable film, and some good thoughts on media and the portrayal of the Holocaust.
B00000GAGT|4.0|Yes, this is a &quot;classic.&quot; Though not the musical muscle flex of their later works (you MUST go endure my ranting review of the Blaze of Glory Album if you haven't already), Slippery When Wet not only 1) generated the mass hits that for many people are the only Bon Jovi songs they know, 2)saved Bon Jovi's career and ALLOWED them to make better albums later on, 3) defined an era, and 4) unified a &quot;band sound&quot; for them, but it was the embryo of what would become the most profound emotional journey as the band marched onward to later albums. This is an essential album both for the band to have made, and for anyone's collection. I don't care how many copies it sells (though please go by another copy so we can see the thing push another platinum level), it's not as good as Jersey, Blaze of Glory (the holy grail), or Faith, ... but it IS good, and when in the right mood, it can still serve emotional functions even after having been listened to for a decade and a half. If you don't have it, would you please just go get it? Enough said about Slippery.
B00003CXXJ|5.0|Shrek is a hilariously funny love story that would be enjoyed by anyone age 1 to 100.  The movie combines life-like animation for the children, and wild humor for adults.  Known for their riotously funny and naughty humor, it's incredible how Mike Myers, star of Austin Powers and Eddie Murphy, star of 48 hours pulled off a movie for kids.  Murphy really delivers the donkey character.<br />     I laughed through the whole movie.  I'm not one to watch a movie over and over again, but each time the kids wanted to see it again, I was right there with them holding my side from the laughter.  The cast includes the voices of Mike Myers (Shrek), Eddie Murphy (Donkey), Cameron Diaz (Princess Fiona), and John Lithgow (Lord Farquaad).<br />     The action really starts when Lord Farquaad decides to rid the kingdom of all the fairy tale creatures by dumping them into a swamp area belonging to a fearsome orge, Shrek, who just wants to live peaceably and ALONE. <br />     In an effort to reclaim his swamp, the orge agrees to go on a quest for Lord Farquaad to rescue the princess and slay the dragon that guards her.  Farquaad would then marry the princess and become king.  Tagging along side of him is the sweet but chattery donkey.  Piece of cake!  This action pack movie never has a dull moment!<br />     Parents will enjoy the trip down memory lane with all the favorite fairy tale characters like Cinderella, Snow White, the seven dwarfs, Robin Hood, the gingerbread man, Pinocchio, the three blind mice, the three little pigs, and many, many more.  <br />     I would definitely recommend buying this movie on DVD.  The game and music video is a must see.  For those looking for morality, it sends a wonderful message that beauty is in the eye of the beholder, and that God has a special someone for everybody.<br />Was this review helpful to you?

0312263120|2.0|After reading DA VINCI CODE, I figured any other book Dan Brown wrote would be great. Wrong. DIGITAL FORTRESS has a great and exciting premise but the writing was horrible. Many, if not all, the paragraphs start out the same way with the same sentence structure. A lot of the sentences are actually the same thing with different words in place. <br />Read it for the story but don't expect a decent writing style. Don't waste your money. Borrow it from the library or a friend.
0385504209|4.0|This is the second fiction book in a row I've read in which Opus Dei and their practice of mortification of the flesh through a cilice has played a role (Tom Flynn's Galactic Rapture is the other). Dan Brown has taken the claims of Baigent, Leigh, and Lincoln's Holy Blood, Holy Grail and made them into a murder mystery novel, full of codes, enigmatic verse, and tales of the Priory of Sion, Knights Templar, and the bloodline of Jesus. It's an entertaining quick read which may also stimulate further research into some of these claims. (For the record, I think the notion that Jesus was married is somewhat plausible, but not substantiated; the stories of the Priory of Sion being carriers of Jesus' bloodline almost certainly false; the stories of an ancient time of peaceful pagan goddess worship are probably bogus--Brown seems to be relying on Riane Eisler's The Chalice and the Blade, a work of pseudohistory.)
B000089RVX|3.0|this CD is good in the musical sense that amy lee's voice is haunting and beautiful, almost like the wake after a funeral.  but the CD dosent flow as well as it would seem, and most of the songs on it sound relitivly the same, evanesence has a unique sound that is enjoyable, just not in such large doses.  it is a lovely CD if you can take that.....as a personal reccommendation the song &quot;Imaginary&quot; is beautiful and hard hitting.
B00005JM0B|1.0|I liked the first movie, and loved the second. But there's so much dumb stuff in this movie it's impossible to list it all here.  This is truly a disappointment, especially with all the time they had to work out the story since T2.
B00003CWLF|5.0|It didn't surprise me when this first came out that it didn't get very good reviews. I almost didn't see it myself, but once I did see it, I just kept coming back. It's a glorious film.    The film itself is done with tremendous diligence -- the costumes, the scenery are fabulous. More importantly, the script is good -- the story itself is a good story. Some films have a really deepening story so that the characters and events are well understood and interconnected, and this is one of those. But the language is also beautiful. It's full of good lines. I think above all, it is Chow Yun-Fat's acting which makes the film -- his humanity, his depth and his nobility. I'm also astounded by the acting of the woman who plays Tuptim... And Jodie Foster fully holds up her end as well.    However, I can see many reasons why people would avoid it. The most important of these is that it's banned in Thailand. The Thai people regard it as an very Westernized take on the story. King Mongkut was in fact an old man at the time this happened, and not the charming young Chow Yun-Fat. There's apparently no evidence from King Mongkut's private diaries that he had anything like the feelings expressed in this film. I can easily believe this is true. The film is fiction. At the very least, I doubt very much that Mongkut's heroic stand on the bridge happened like it's portrayed in the film.     But I also can't buy that the film comes across as putting down Eastern culture. Unlike in \\"The King and I\\" (of which it is by no means a simple remake) where Anna clearly has the upper hand, this is an even match. She has as much to learn from him as he from her. England has as much to learn from Thailand as the other way around.    My mother didn't like it, because although she's the sort of person which appreciates a good story, she can't stand graphic beheadings. And others of my friends don't like it, because although the like a good battle scene, they can't stand little girls dying in their father's arms -- way too gushy. I loved it all.
B0000BYM3K|3.0|Kevin Shirley dropped the ball here. So many songs here are clearly good (if you can forget the Steve Harris´s recent trademark of repetitive chorus all the way), but the overall impact is destroyed by an incredible bad production by master Kevin Shirley, resulting in a muddy, mixed sound, where the instruments and the voice of Bruce does not sound strong and clear. Very weird.Maybe that´s because Steve Harris was co-producer...<br />I´ll not comment about the cover art. The worst of their career.<br />I´ll comment about Janick Gers. He needs to go. No technical improvment for him here, but at least he wrote the tittle track, one of the best of the album.<br />I´ll comment about Nicko´s lack of inspiration here. There´s not one single great drum fill here. He´s playing safe and uninspired. I did not understand that.<br />I´ll comment about Adrian Smith´s guitar playing. He steals the show here. His solos are by far the best. This guy is pure genius and technique and feeling.<br />I´ll comment about the songs. Three fillers in my opinion: The horrible opening track, &quot;Gates of Tomorrow&quot; and &quot;New Frontier&quot;. Best songs: &quot;Paschendale&quot;, &quot;Dance of Death&quot;, &quot;Montsegur&quot;.
B000002OX5|5.0|The summer of 1967 was described as the Summer of Love by a bunch of journalists covering the emerging Haight Ashbury music scene. For most of us, it was the summer of the Beatles &quot;Sargeant Pepper's&quot;, the Mothers' &quot;Absolutely Free&quot;, the Doors self titled debut, the Airplane's &quot;Surrealistic Pillow&quot; and the remarkable debut of Jimi Hendrix with &quot;Are You Experienced?&quot; The Who's explosive performace at Monterey eclipsed that of Hendrix, whose somewhat contrived guitar burning, generated far less heat than the Who's anarchic destruction of all of their equipment at the end of their set. Hendrix learned early on about the hazards of closing a show with the Who on the bill. &quot;The Who Sell Out&quot; which was released before the momentous summer of 1967, is still a fan favorite, but it understated the Who's ability to deliver the goods on stage. Only a few fans, who saw the Who cursed with the thankless task of opening for the Monkees' &quot;Yes, We Can Play Our Instruments&quot; tour, in 1966, knew of the inspired anarchy of the Who's live performances. &quot;The Who Sell Out&quot; is a great collection of songs in a satiric parody of banal the AM radio format, but it won't be another year before the Townsend takes off the gloves and shows the world what he's capable of with &quot;Tommy&quot;.<br />&quot;The Who Sell Out&quot; also suffered mightily when it was transferred to the compact disc format. It's apparent that the orginal vinyl masters were not available, or were in horrible shape when &quot;The Who Sell Out&quot; made it's debut as a compact disc. Now after over 20 years this crucial early Who album has been restored to the orginal warm analogic glory of vinyl, ironically because of digital remastering techniques. The muddy mix is gone and the overtones are cleaned up and you get a true, blue Who. There are nine additional cuts are suprisingly good  particularly &quot;Jaguar&quot; and &quot;Glow Girl&quot; which are early test runs songs using themes from the &quot;Tommy&quot; overture. This beautiful remastering, along with the excellent remastering of &quot;A Quick One&quot; aka &quot;Happy Jack&quot; completes a full remastering of the early Who albums. This is beautiful music to the ears of hardcore Who fans.rly test runs songs using themes from the &quot;Tommy&quot; overture.

0226264211|1.0|This books seemed to me just a world of lies. Besides the bad writing style of the author, this books just su...ks.<br />Friedman seems to live in a world where there is no monopoly,  where the companies do not almost anything to get richer, including faking their accountancy (as recent scandals show); firing thousands of employess in the name of &quot;reengineering&quot;; creating conglomerates to dominate a specific market; destroying foreign countrie's currencies with specultative atacks made by &quot;investors&quot; that does not constroy nothing, just speculate; pressing governments to abolish hard earned social rights, even if they are minor ones; charging the common people with scorching interest rates when giving loans; etc, etc.<br />Friedman book is the worst thing you can get if you are interested in reading something about ecnomy. This obviously capitalism-corrupted writer simply can't have a sense of seeing the two sides. Here in this book he's on a race to glorify capitalism, nothing more. I despise this book.
B0000DD7NL|5.0|Alicia has once again dropped another hit on the world.  It is something very difficult to top songs like \\"Woman's Worth\\" and \\"Fallin'\\" but she has and will continue do so for a long time.<BR>She really hits hard with \\"When You Really Love Someone\\" and \\"You Don't Know My Name\\" and still keeps you wanting a next album.  Don't buy this album because Alicia Keys is sexy or because she has a nice voice, buy this album because her passion for music is real and it's who she is.
B000002I2G|5.0|The Soft Parade by the Doors is an album that boldly and cooly demonstrated that this group's musical directions were not limited to the raw, amped, hard sound that they had honed and perfected in their pre-Electra days.  The album is well-orchestrated, contains excellent material, and while not necessarily a \\"concept\\" album in the mold of Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band, it is a collection of songs, in my critical opinion, that are superior to any of the Beatles \\"wall of sound\\" offerings.  <br />The Doors were very unique and accomplished musically.  The basic guitar-organ interaction has never quite been completed as nicely than by this group and a similar arguement, perhaps, can be stated about their integration of horns and string into hard rock.  The music (specifically The Soft Parade) is tonal and refined yet the lyrics can be somewhat dim to the non-cognitive thinker.  The overall feeling generated is very much less commercially appealing than any other Doors album and for that reason the beginning Doors listener should probably pass on this album unless he/she wants their trademark blues-based rock presented under the lights on stage at Carnegie Hall.     <br />While the Soft Parade was not this group's greatest commercial success and certainly not their most critically acclaimed album, it was important for many respects, not the least of which was the idea of simply providing music listeners with a different Doors sound.  A more orchestrated and complex music that still captured the bluesy, psychedelic feel of the more recognizable Doors material.  In my opinion, the Doors were at their best in a more simple, live setting with only Ray, Robby, and John providing a musical avenue for Jim to energetically explore.  But The Soft Parade provides great music and that is its only intended purpose.        <br />Here's a brief song-by-song alaytical review of The Soft Parade:<br />\\"Tell All The People\\"---A song that really jumps at the listener and quickly sets the unique tone of this album.  The basic premise of the lyrics fit very well within this group aside from the line \\"get your guns, follow me down\\", which Jim Morrison objected to, and as a result, song-writing credits were distributed individually instead of by \\"the Doors\\".  The music is catchy and, as is common with over-looked Doors material, gets better as the song progresses.  Very appropriate in length.<BR>B<br />\\"Touch Me\\"---The biggest commercial success of this album was also the least divergent, at least in terms of arrangement.  This song is nearly always included in \\"greatest hits\\" packages and rightly so.  Morrison performs exceptionally well with his voice and the band is tight.  One only wonders if the extended Curtis Amy sax solo near the end in some way inspired the Stones for their sax inclusion with \\"Brown Sugar\\".  Many people feel that \\"Love Her Madly\\" was a re-write of this song.  I don't know but they are both great songs.<BR>A<br />\\"Shaman's Blues\\"---A mystical, mysterious piece that highlights the interplay between Robby and Ray.  It has a driving sound that is reminicent (or at the time, revealing) of some of the material included on their next album, \\"Morrison Hotel\\".  One of the better songs on this album.<BR>B plus<br />\\"Do It\\"---A jazzy concoction that certainly wasn't produced with radio airplay in mind.  Optimistic but limited lyrics combine  with great drumming to...well....perhaps a soaring interlude would have really set this song apart.  This is definitely the egg of the album but can be jammed to with some intent.  Not a bad song.<BR>C     <br />\\"Easy Ride\\"---This is a fun song to listen to.  It has hints of sexuality, the organ is carnivalistic and there are some good lyrics here and there.  This is a bright song that in Ray Manzarek's words was, \\"a country-rocker--by way of Muddy Waters 'Got My Mojo Working'\\".  The ending verses are classic Doors and the highlight of this track.<BR>B<br />\\"Wild Child\\"---This is a Doors songthat, along with \\"Moonlight Drive\\" and \\"Hyacinth House\\", are not largely known to the general populace but very, very good.  The song opens with a hard guitar riff and quickly builds up to the full-band sound and, later, to a fully raucus organ-based rocker.  All hands are excellent in this track.  The lyrics are autobiographical for Jim and highly poetic.  Maybe if this one had an easier-to-understand lyrical body it would have gone to a high chart position --(this can probably be said about a good many of the Doors songs, but the depth and purpose of their lyrics are one of their hallmarks and greatest strengths as a band)-- Like \\"Touch Me\\", this song has an interesting ending.<BR>A-<br />\\"Running Blues\\"---A lot can be said about this song.  It has elements of jazz, rock, bluegrass, and a big-band feel but it is not to be taken seriously.  It uniquely bounces around musically and in short, sounds good.  I think that a person can listen to this song more than once in a row.  Creatively, what did the Beatles or Stones have on this band? <BR>B plus<br />\\"Wishful Sinful\\"---A more serious song that is magnificently put together with its classical elements.  This song provides the best representation of the band's success with this album.  Jim's voice is deeply involved and emotionally tragic to perfectly fit the overall theme.  A song like this really sets apart the Doors from 60's psychedelic standards Jimi Henrix, The Grateful Dead, or the Jefferson Airplane.  Listen to this one.<BR>A     <br />\\"The Soft Parade\\"---The album's title track was envisioned by the Doors to be a grand sonic spectacle that would be another culmination of their musical vision like \\"The End\\" and \\"When The Music's Over\\".  It is interesting and unique.  It was done well and has great moments but the transgression of this four-part suite didn't quite elevate this song into the upper-strata of Doors material.  It is a song that is clearly the Doors and they do a good job.  I think the version on\\"Essential Rarities\\"  may be a little better than the original album production.<BR>B plus<br />Overall album rating---B plus
B0000AQVCL|4.0|These guys are great.  They and a number of other new bands like them are bringing back good solid rock.  If you like these guys, you should check out Supagroup out of New Orleans.  Like Jet, they a are no frills guitar driven rock band.  Awesome!
B0000E1WKE|1.0|This cd isn't good at all.  Whitney has lost her voice along with her public image.  She wheezes her way through tracks and cracks when holding notes in 'O Holy Night'.  Don't let these good reviews by her die-hard fans fool you, she's NOT the Whitney Houston we once knew.
B00004BZ16|5.0|I was going to write another review of this record, but I've decided instead to include a list of quotes from the 98 existing reviews (I actually only read 70 of them).<br />Quotes on &quot;Sandinista&quot; from other reviewers:<br />- &quot;THE FINEST MOST PERFECT ALBUM OF ALL TIME&quot;<BR>- &quot;It's the greatest multiple album ever recorded.&quot;<BR>- &quot;There aren't many rock albums I listen to twenty years after release, but this is one of them.&quot;<BR>- &quot;Definitely one of my top five of all time, and maybe number one.&quot;<BR>- &quot;Possibly the greatest c.d. of all time&quot;<BR>- &quot;Some of the greatest moments of rock lie in this set.&quot;<BR>- &quot;The Clash's best work and one of the all-time great records.&quot;<BR>- &quot;If I could only own one cd...&quot;<BR>- &quot;...this is a true classic, a desert island disk.&quot;<BR>- &quot;This is my all time favorite album and it's never sounded better.&quot;<BR>- &quot;It belongs in the canon of the greatest works of rock and roll.&quot;<BR>- &quot;Sandinista was the greatest rock album ever.&quot;<br />I wonder how many other rock albums on Amazon.com are described by so many people in terms like these.<br />On the other hand, be warned:  this record might not be for people looking for more of &quot;The Clash sound&quot;.    This album has no &quot;sound&quot;.    To quote yet another review:<br />&quot;Like the Beatles' WHITE ALBUM, SANDINISTA finds a band at the height of its creativity taking on a myriad of musical genres and succeding on virtually every attempt.&quot;<br />Another reviewer expresses it this way:<br />&quot;Despite its genuine greatness, Sandinista! is really only for true fans of music that defies any one genre or label.&quot;<br />Finally, in my own words:  this album is an explosion of intelligent, creative ideas created by a band that was consciously seeking to create music that was fresh, new and unlike anything else--including anything of their own.   It contains as many good musical ideas as any rock record I've ever heard.   Some of the ideas--horrors!--aren't successful.   But there are just enough successful ideas for this to be among the greatest rock albums I know of.   And yes, I still listen to it 20 years after its release.
0060527978|5.0|It's difficult to find Warriors in this era. People with old souls who try and see things for what they are as opposed to what they should be. This book is amazing. I own both the English and French version; which is very well written. I am a huge critic of books and this book is definately one of my favorites along with: Le Guerrier interieure, Shambhala Warrior and the Four Agreements. A book that really disappointed me was &quot;Soul sword&quot;...horrible. If you like books which teach you something about yourself, then you might want to grab this one. Paulo Coelho did it again!
B000092ZYX|5.0|I have to admit that i was warry that Radiohead was going to go with the Kid A type sound, but when i listened to it... wow. It blew me out of my head. With some of the most challenging musician ship and vocals radiohead is definetly the best band of this millenium. I just love it so much.
B00006V9A0|5.0|hey this cd is great. do give it a bad review just because of you know you're right. that song is the whole ancholada of this cd. that is the last ever recording of this band. those who dont like this song thats ok. its your opinion. if you dont respect that the fact they recored this song then your not a nirvana fan what so ever. if you have any coments email me at brandonh692000@yahoo.com
B000002HRE|2.0|ReLoad is both the same album as, and the opposite of Load. The new sound of the band will be instantly recognizable from the opening riff of Fuel - but wait. Fuel goes along at a rapid clip that fans of Metallica's older, speedier works will appreciate way more than anything on Load. It's this first impression that made a lot of people hail ReLoad as a return to form after the disappointing Load.<br />Unfortunately, that's where the speed metal stops. The rest of ReLoad is the same mid-tempo country grooves in the heavy parts. Again, these grooves become tedious - but this time, there's no redemptive uber-ballads like there were on Load, except for Fixxxer. As a result, ReLoad drags on much more than it should. <br />The bright spots come in the aforementioned Fuel and Fixxxer, but The Memory Remains is another good track here. The lyrics are sadly ironic in the post-Napster and post-St. Anger period of Metallica's development, as in a sense they seem to be foretelling their own demise. It's probably the most tragic track Metallica has ever written - but nobody ever said that was a bad thing in metal.<br />At the end of the day, though, ReLoad is a rehash of the much-maligned Load with fewer bright spots. Buy with extreme caution.
B0000069NM|5.0|John Scofield falls into place as the fourth member of Medeski Martin and Wood (back up band (organ,bass,drums trio) in the jazz masterpiece that everyone should own. It's compliments the mood of every season in its consistent style and mellow flow. This album transcends time and everything decadent through its perfection. You must buy this album!!
B000062YAZ|5.0|Reign In Blood has almost every element that has ever made a truly great metal album - and what it lacks in melody, it more than makes up for in sheer violent energy. <br />Right from the opening lightning-fast riff of Angel of Death, it is clear that this will not be any Black Sabbath drag through mid-tempo grooves. Clocking in at less than 30 minutes, there's no track on Reign In Blood that remains anything less than thrashy for long. Hanneman and King make their guitars growl like demons and scream like the damned while their intensity never falters for a moment. The extremely technical and devastating guitar attack is more than matched by the punishing Dave Lombardo on drums. As the album progresses, Slayer never lets up, never trips off through artificially mellow passages and, amazingly enough, never grows monotonous, despite the absence of much variety. <br />The lyrics match the fury of the music with violent depictions of Nazi death camp medical experiments, defiant statements of rebellion against religion, society, etc. and in the closer, Raining Blood, a nightmare fantasy like no other. All throughout, Araya's voice is as furious as the words. You can't doubt Slayer's conviction or raw power for a second as they make anthems out of what a lesser band would turn into cheese. <br />Reign In Blood, the whole album from beginning to end, is a masterpiece. Recommended strongly not only as one of the Holy Trinity of thrash metal (which also includes Master of Puppets and Peace Sells), but as the gold standard and ultimate testament to the power of metal.<br />HAIL SLAYER!
B00008H2LB|5.0|Look people, first of all you cant compare Linkin Park to any genre because they have their own type of music. It sounds like techno/rap/rock which is something people dont understand. Anyway about the album. Hybrid Theory was a great album that jump started this band but, in my opinion, Meteora is like an upgraded Hybrid Theory. The first time I heard faint, guess what, I nearly fainted! I was at my friends house and the song started playing and I was just entranced. This combonation of rap/techno/rock I loved so much was back! I then bought the album and listened to the whole thing. Somewhere I belong was another song that caught my attention (but sadly since I listened so much on the plane to London whenever I hear it I think of that smelly cramped aircraft). When I reached Numb for the first time, I thought it sounded a little too much like Nstink but I listened to it again and I loved it. I can't explain it but it just gets better every time. Meteora is definetly one of the best albums I have ever heard and anyone who is a fan of Linkin Park and hasn't bought this yet is missing out
B0000CDLA7|4.0|From minute one, Dream Theater's eighth full-length album was meant to be a classic, no-holds-barred metal album - and Train of Thought delivers on that plan. <br />While the legendary prog-rock masters have hinted at uber-metal power before on tracks like The Glass Prison, never before have they ratcheted the assault up to this level and sustained it for 70 minutes. As I Am and This Dying Soul, a sequel to The Glass Prison, kick off the album with a Metallica-esque groove followed by a monster 7-string/double bass riff of amazing strength at the beginning of the second track. Endless Sacrifice, by far the album's strongest track, builds and builds up to a magnificent and supremely satisfying climax. The other standout tracks include Vacant/Stream of Consciousness, a pair of songs built around the same chord structure and milked to 15 minutes of great effect. All throughout, John Petrucci's guitar solos are technically amazing enough to stun even long-time fans, and John Myung's bass lines are forceful and virtuosic. Jordan Rudess puts in his perfunctory (but still impressive) keyboard work, almost an afterthought in a metal work as fiery as this one.<br />The problems with Train of Thought arise when you stop and think back to where you've heard it all before (and you have). Petrucci's solos, while they've never been more technically amazing, can get to be a bit sterile after a while. A little more slow material allowing the band to stretch out and demonstrate their awesome sense of melody would have been welcome. As it is, we only get the 3-minute Vacant, which doesn't even involve the full band. In The Name of God's gigantic finish, with James LaBrie's vocals soaring above long arena-rock power chords and keyboard textures, is almost textbook Dream Theater, so much so that one starts to wonder whether some of the band's spark is fading.<br />In the end, while this album is an excellent effort and a big step up from the overly pretentious Six Degrees of Inner Turbulence, it runs the risk of becoming Dream Theater's &quot;Black Album&quot;, literally and by comparison with Metallica. Still strongly recommended though.
0767817478|1.0|Looking over Maria Pitillo's career, she has done rather well as an actress. But as soon as GODZILLA, the bomb of 1998, arrived, her career took a nosedive. Perhaps it was because she won a Razzie Award for worst supporting actress. Or maybe it was because her critics were unkind. It is true that Ms. Pitillo's sub-par performance was just one distraction in this monumental piece of celluloid crap. But I am not going out of my way to compliment Matthew Broderick's acting. Nor was Jean Reno helpful. And thank goodness for The Simpsons or else Hank Azaria might be out of work. None of these performers impressed me. And yet only Ms. Pitillo has been directly affected by Roland Emmerich's GODZILLA, easily the worst movie of 1998. Ms. Pitillo should not be blamed for her performance in a movie filled with poor acting. The writing was bad. The direction was bad. Even Godzilla (herself???) seemed embarrassed by this  fiasco. How can you blame one actor when you should be pointing the finger at the whole production? As for Maria Pitillo, I expect she will one day bounce back from this unruly treatment some day soon, and win an award for her many acting skills, and it won't be another Razzie.
B0000DD7NL|5.0|Wow! How does she make this so easy, there are other artists who have problems following up to a successful beginning and for Miss Keys to come up with such a brilliant album, says alot! I looooove this album, better than the first...
B000089CKH|5.0|Let Go is the masterpiece that Nada Surf has always been threathening to deliver and comes at a time where rock `n' roll requires reinvention without sacrificing the basic foundations of melody and passion. Whilst eclecticism is always to be prized, Let Go does not stray too far from the folk-infused arousing power rock that Nada Surf excels in.

B0000931OG|2.0|Misleadingly, the first couple of tracks may lull you into a false sense of security as the atmospheric \\"Ambulance,\\" the pleasing \\"Out of Time\\" and the raucous \\"Crazy Beat,\\" whilst never touching the stature of classic Britpop at least maintains an air of freewheeling brilliance. <BR>However, after this short starburst, the rest of Think Tank meanders meaninglessly before dropping off badly into distracted, self-indulgent and mundane chaos. <BR>To think that I found Oasis' Heathen Chemistry a more rewarding and satisfying experience. How sad.
B0000E1WKE|1.0|I would use caution when reading the reviews here. While some are legit, there are some (including this one) whose ranking means nothing. If you take a look at reviews for a lot of the Holiday CDs that have come out this year, as well as previous years, you will notice that someone (or several people) having been using the reviews to advertise for Whitney's album. It is sad. I haven't heard the album, I'll bet it is great, but I don't like the tactics her fans or her &quot;people&quot; are using. It is wrong and rather pathetic.
B00005JM0B|5.0|The Terminator series is a rare series indeed. Each movie keeps getting better and better! Prior to the third movie release, T2 was my obvious favorite out of the series. But now T3 is cleary my new favorite in the series! <BR>The action is non-stop and the story is one of the best out of all of the movies that came out this year! The extras on the DVD are excellent and will keep you glued to your TV. Too bad Arnold is Governor right now. I am really wanting to see a fourth film in the series!
B00008NRL8|5.0|To all those who think tango is Brazilian, it is not. It is from Argentina. If tango is from Blazil, then caipirinha is from Russia. Anyway, a very nice CD. Tango for the electronic masses...Ay! Milonga de amor...
B00005JM0B|5.0|The story itself takes places about 10 years after Sarah &amp; John Conner along with the T-101 defeated the ruthless T-1000 &amp; prevented Judgement (or so they thought). Now in T3, Sarah is deceased, and John is lone warrior. John becomes a drifter with No Identification, No Phone, no friends, nada, zip, nothing. Now a new threat has come back from the future to wipe out John Conner. This new modified Terminator is Cyberne's most sophisticated creation, the T-X. The TX is sent back to murder Conner, his Lieutentents, and future spouse Kathryn Brewster. But alas, John has a savior, the now absoulte T-101 returns to protect Conner &amp; Brewster from the T-X's unstoppable rage. The war against the machines begins &amp; the time for Judgement Day looms.<br />Terminator 3 Rise of The Machines is without question, the best action-packed movie of 2003, and for it's $170 million budget ya it's almost certain. Lot of special features from all sorts of stuff. Although T3 will never equal the T1 or T2 in terms of dynamic storyline, it's huge budget gives you good movie to kick back, relax, and enjoy. The only flaw of T3 is the fact that's not directed by it's creator James Cameron, but still Johnathan Moscow does a fairly decent job filling the gigantic shoes of Mr. Cameron's baby. I am looking forward to seeing T4, hopefully in the future, but now with Schwarzenegger's induction as Governor of California, the chance of T4 happening anytime soon is very slim. So I'll guess we'll just have to wait. Heck we had to wait 12 years for T3, I think we can wait for T4.
B00005BK3M|5.0|I sat down to watch this movie when I was a lot younger than I am today. I liked it, but tried to hide it and spoke negatively about the film and some of the actors and actresses. But, to tell you the truth, this may very well be one of the best movies I have ever seen in my life.<br />E.T. isn't what one might call a pretty picture on the outside. But they say true beauty is on the inside. After watching this movie, I couldn't agree more. This movie is about a young boy named Elliot (Henry Thomas) meeting and becoming friends with an alien who was mistakenly left on Earth. Elliot is a lonely boy who is still searching for the meaning of true friendship.<br />I believe this is the best movie Steven Spielberg has made. His idea of creating E.T. was ingenious. This movie will touch your heart if you let it. I was touched by the bittersweet ending of the movie. Every person involved with this great movie is to be commended. I didn't like some of the personalities depicted at the beginning of the movie, but this movie was great. God bless America and God bless E.T.
B0000AXE8I|1.0|If the W brothers handed this sequel over to a small group of professional hacks, the result would have been the same: a parody of the original Matrix. No, make that half a parody. This isn't even a complete story. Sure, the special effects are good. But the look of the movie is too green, and the best special effects are simply bigger versions of the stuff we saw in the first film. This time, the fight scenes were conceived before the plot --- and the much-talked-about philosophical underpinning of the Matrix was discarded in favor of gibberish about 'purpose' and 'choice.'<br />I did enjoy seeing Zion. The underground city looked good --- except for the rave scene . . . and the speeches that took place in apartments and on balconies. The W brothers could have used this moment to explain how Zion functions, but they didn't bother. The scenes that follow are a jumble of pointless fights and chases, intercut with long philosophical discussions. None of it goes anywhere. There are at least three fights that could have been cut with no effect on the plot. And the endless talk just confuses things instead of clarifying. (Honestly, I think the Oracle was just mocking Neo with gibberish in her scene.) They saved the worst for last. An hour's worth of action, fights, characters, and explanation is squeezed into the final twenty minutes. <br />The Matrix Reloaded takes a science fiction world millions of people love and it removes everything that made them love it. The mystery (&quot;What is the Matrix?&quot;) is gone. We all know what it is, and there's no new mystery added to keep us interested. The philosophy we enjoyed is reduced to the repetition of key words like 'choice.' But there's always the third movie, right? Maybe it will redeem this one. But don't count on it.
0385504209|1.0|In short I wish I could give negative stars for this book. For someone who is trying to &quot;expose&quot; things, the author gets several of his so called &quot;facts&quot; wrong. First Constantine did not make Christianity the official religion of the Empire, he merely LEGALIZED it, his successor Theodosius made it the official religion. Second, SOPHIA is spelled with a ph in Greek, attic or otherwise, not with F as it is Latin. Finally, the ending was both predictable and nonsensical. He spends about oh, 300 pages establishing the DCPJ chief as the &quot;Teacher&quot; then about 20 pages near the end decides no wait, i'll make it Teabing because that just seems cooler. He's been watching THE SUBSITUTE and many other movies that have this hackneyed plot device too many times. As a professor of ancient and medieval history, Brown has done a grave disservice to my profession. While one would think that it should end with this, it doesn't. In future I will be forced to teach students who have read this tripe and believe it was real or that the author did any reasearch outside of a 100 level course textbook. One more thing, Saturnalia was the ancient festival of Saturn, one of the Titans who did not die and come back to life after five days, the five days refer to the lag time between the end and the beginning of the Roman political calender. It was also the festival of about every other eastern deity. I hope Catholic bashing goes out of style soon and its very sad that Brown will profit from both this book and the future movie which will be spawned by Satan himself. But im sure WICCA will love this one
B000001FS6|3.0|When U2 made Rattle and Hum, they confused people. They started out with a live album to go with their concert film, but then they added some new live tracks --- one of their own (Silver and Gold) and one by the Beatles (Helter Skelter). They cut 6 or 7 new songs. Some of them were with guest stars like BB King and Bob Dylan. Then the Edge got a lead vocal. Then they added a bit of Jimi Hendrix playing the Star Spangled Banner.<br />Okay guys. Are you really wondering why people were confused and/or disappointed? You have to commend the band for taking a few chances, of course. They took a perfectly good live album and squeezed an EP of &quot;American roots music&quot; songs into it. They thought it would work, but it didn't.<br />The whole thing would be an afterthought, but this is U2. When they make an album between &quot;proper&quot; albums, they have trouble making it modest. It happened again with Zooropa: After a big tour, they tried to make a little post-tour CD of outtakes and experiments, but it grew into a  full-sized album.<br />In the end, just about everyone likes half of Rattle and Hum. But few people agree on exactly which half. I prefer the studio tracks that either sound like Joshua Tree outtakes (like Heartland) or the noisy stuff like God Part 2. I don't have any use for live versions of the Joshua Tree songs. They're overproduced and dull. Fans will always come back to this CD for their favorite parts. Non-fans can probably live without it.
B00000HZFP|5.0|Lyricist &amp; composer wrote an amazing collection of music!
B00008VGL6|3.0|My general feeling is that this is an album for those who wanted more of Gore's voice than Depeche Mode fans have been accustomed to, especially the last few years. Anyone not a fan of Gore/Depeche Mode probably isn't going to become one now.<br />The album has a consistent tone (albeit skeletal), but that is often part of the nature of electronica, I suppose. <br />The songs are very interesting, and Gore does seem to vary between being under- and over-emotive. While not ground-breaking, this album is a collection of eccentric songs as performed by a talented artist. I enjoy this album, but I do consider it to be an acquired taste not for everyone.
B000002BQK|5.0|I am an absolutely fanatic Mariah fan, but this is probably the album for music lovers in general, probably one of the greatest albums ever written. Mixing soul, RnB and pop, adding ballads and more up-tempo numbers with one or two adult contemporary numbers, this album has it all. The emotion felt put into this album is undeniable and inspiring. Whether a fan or not, buy this album as it is both sophisticated and lyrically complete. A true classic
B00000HZH7|1.0|Out of all the albums that I have heard, this is one of the worst when it comes to production. It literally sounds like they hung up a mike in their rehersal room! It sounds terrible! If somehow you can get though the ransid production, then you find out that the band has no real talent. Sorry Possessed fans (the few of you out there), but there is much better material out there than this. Poor lyrics, poor riffs, and poor guitar playing! Yes you read right! Possessed is talentless and only got notieced for a VERY short time because of their evil image. I'm not buying into it and intelligent listeners shouldn't either. Go listen to Testament, old Metallica, Megadeth, etc, anything but this. There is no enjoyment on this album. You can't even feed off of the aggression like on Slayer albums. I'm glad Possessed is dead. These guys gave metal a bad name.
B00001ZWBQ|5.0|rated 5 star's -sound extraordinary,performance-super.If you like the Bee Gees, thsi is the DVD that you are looking for.
B00004RJ74|2.0|this movie started out like it was going to be a really good tarantino movie, then up and turns into something else. i'm also not a fan of the fact that cheech plays like three different characters. it's just confusing. probably wouldn't highly recommend the movie...
B0000DJZA5|4.0|the title of the  release? stupid. the cd cover art? terrible! the music inside the cd jewel case? outstanding! disc one clocks in at 35+ minutes, so i can't understand why they opted for a 2 1/2 minute version of Get Back. the original is much better, IMO. why remove maggie mae and dig it? there's still 45 minutes of free disc space left. <br />disc 2 totals twenty minutes. not much here, and again allot of wasted blank space. an opportunist must have saw $ signs when thinking of releasing this. still, the music on disc 1 makes it worth owning.
B0000C1733|4.0|This is the first time that a compilation CD of the Red Hot Chili Peppers has been released with a large number of their great songs. What Hits?! is good if you like their early to mid eighties songs, most of which are excluded on this disc. Almost all of their great songs are here including &quot;Higher Ground,&quot; &quot;Under the Bridge,&quot; and &quot;By the Way.&quot; The only disappointing part is that they left off &quot;Around the World,&quot; which is understandable since it was never a hit single. It is also great that they left off the heavily overplayed &quot;Zephyr Song&quot; which was played alomst 3-6 times on every rock radio station from September to late December 2002. Still a good hits compilation for the second half of their career.
B0000D96NX|5.0|This cd is amazing.I like everything that they have done but I'm glad to see them go back to there roots.Through the Ashes of Empires is a must buy to any Machine Head fan.
B00004Y7SF|1.0|I'm so happy I didn't buy this album. I was over my friends house, and he purchase this cd. He was telling me how AWFUL this album was. I just couldnt believe it, so I told him let me listen to it. I played &quot;My Kind Of Christmas&quot; and to sum it up in one word. It's TERRIBLE, total waste of money. There is no reason to buy this christmas cd. I wouldnt recommend it its CRAP!
B000002UJQ|5.0|This album is one of those rare works that simply moves you.<BR>It's great electronic and effects-driven textures provide the listener with a blissful atmosphere. The one thing I particularly liked about this album was that you hear something new every time you listen to it. Although I admit, you have to listen to it a few times to truly appreciate it. It will please most casual listeners who don't even usually listen to Radiohead.<BR>It's just one of those great, atmospheric albums that you can enjoy every time you listen. Now here's an individual analysis of each song:<br />1.&quot;Airbag&quot;- The opener is a good song that pretty much  represents the album's sound.Not one of my favourites, but nonetheless a great song.<br />2.&quot;Paranoid Android&quot;- A great song that blends the band's great acoustic sound with the electronica of keyboards and electric guitar. A very dynamic (and long) song that is definately one of the best songs on the CD.<br />3. &quot;Subterranean Homesick Alien&quot;- This song best represents the band's use of effects-layered guitars and keyboards to creat that sonic bliss of this album.<br />4.&quot;Exit Music (For A Film&quot;- This is a excellent, classic Radiohead song that is very good. It is mostly a great acoustic ballad, and one of the more emotional songs on the record. Definatley want to check this song out.<br />5. &quot;Let Down&quot;- I don't particularly like this song, but it takes a few listens to get used to. Not one of the CD's better songs.<br />6.&quot;Karma Police&quot;- A great melody-driven acoustic song that uses mostly piano and acoustic guitar. The most familiar song on the album and for a good reason. You'll probably like this song at first listen.<br />7.&quot;Fitter Happier&quot;- Just an interlude with a robot talking.<br />8.&quot;Electioneering&quot;- A great rock song. One of the faster songs and also very listener friendly. Very electric-guitar driven and sort of has a jammy vibe towards the end. <br/>9.&quot;Climbing Up the Walls&quot;-This is the album's masterpiece. It is my personal favourite from this album and also one of my favourite songs of all time. It's a very emotional, acoustic song with random sounds in the background and a great electric guitar line going in the background. The vox are very distorted and anmost cry. A symphony comes in at the end of the song. Definatley the best song on the album, the most epic, and the most emotional.<br />10. &quot;No Surprises&quot;- I don't like this song at all. WAY too happy.<br />11. &quot;Lucky&quot;- Like Karma Police, a very meldody driven song, but has more emotion and cool electric guitar lines. Another one of my favourites. Great song.<br />12. &quot;The Tourist&quot;- The closer is very emotional and boring. Not a very good song<br />Overall, this is my 2nd favourite album of all time (nest to Tool's &quot;Aenima&quot; and well deserves 5 stars.<BR>Great album. Essential alt. rock CD. Buy it now!
B0000E1WKE|5.0|I just bought my copy yesterday. Whitney Houston does a great job on &quot;O Holy Night&quot;, &quot;The First Noel&quot;, &quot;Joy To The World&quot;, &quot;Deck The Halls/Silent Night&quot;. &quot;One Wish&quot; is just a great holiday album. I'm happy I took you guys advice, and purchase this masterpiece!
B000002J09|5.0|Guys, just ignore that idiot who spazzed and claimed Limp Bizkit surpassed The Zep. He obviously has no culture, and is probably mentally challenged. Leave him to his own, its good to see someone as obviously stunted as him facing the world without fear. You go superstar! <br />Anyhow, the album. I mean, I'm only 15 so I can't say I've been with The Zep for half as long as many of you, but man, if the ground beneath me didn't give way when I first listened to this compilation of musical genious. Up there with Pink Floyd, The Who and The Rolling Stones. Rock lives, well, actually, &quot;lived&quot;. Oh well, not all good things last forever.
B0000E1WKE|5.0|If you're looking for a great christmas album that will touch your soul, and keep you wanting more look no further then &quot;One Wish&quot; its a great christmas album from begining to end. Every traditional song Whitney sung she did it with such classy, style. I will definately be playing Whitney's &quot;One Wish&quot; every year for christmas.
B000002TQV|5.0|who are you trying to fool? \\"The Bends\\" is the quintessential '90s rock album as well as Radiohead's best album. \\"High and Dry\\" and \\"Street Spirit\\" got some airplay but other songs (Sulk, Just, The Bends) are better. This album comes from a time and place when Radiohead were an actual BAND, not a whiny hermetic weirdo and a guy on a Macbook.<br /><br />This is just my opinion. I also love the album that comes after this (of course), which is when most people checked in on Radiohead. The one benefit of the fame attained from OK and their following albums is that it leads those unfamiliar with the The Bends to discover it and hopefully appreciate it.

B00003CXXO|4.0|I understand that Steven Spielberg took over this project started by the late Stanley Kubrick, which would explain the uneasy edge to the usual Spielbergian treatment.  The remnants of Kubrick's message, namely that humans are soon-to-be obsolete beasts, contend with the usual Spielberg formula of corn syrup, tears, and awe, so that the result is unsettling and more than a bit curiouser and curiouser.<br />First of all, be aware that, despite the fact that there is a full serving of the Spielberg recipe here (cute kids, dazzling special effects, a beautiful score by John Williams, social consciousness seen largely from a kid's POV, etc.), this is not a &quot;feel good&quot; movie that will appeal to the mass audience at which Spielberg usually aims.  The heartland of America will find this film disturbing and will tell their neighbors to stay away.  Sci fi afficionados of the hard science variety (like myself) will have mixed feelings since some of the science is, shall we say, unlikely.  The fantasy/sorcery crowd will probably be disenchanted for other reasons, although there is a glorious ending that might mist up one's eyes (it did mine).  Overall, however, this is an unsettling look at humanity and where we're headin' (&quot;Is that Lincoln County Road or Armageddon?&quot;), and the treatment is definitely NOT something for the kiddies.  It's liable to give them nightmares.<br />The central hook of the film is that we are made to identify with the robotic mechas, especially Haley Joel Osment's David and Jack Angel's Teddy and Jude Law's Gigolo Joe, while being reminded that they are not human, or more properly, that they are more admirable than human.  In a way the robots resemble the have-nots of the current society, the handicapped and the poor, while the humans in the persons of Monica Swinton (Frances O'Connor), her son Martin (Jake Thomas) and the Flesh Fair entrepreneur (Brendan Gleeson) represent respectively the privileged, the cruel, and the exploitive.  Monica's compromised morality is made clear in the scene in the woods (which I won't describe for fear of giving away too much).  One also gets the sense that she and her husband (who portray the usual kid-show parental mentality) are not actually bright enough to figure out what has happened when siblings and friends have conflicts.  Monica simply sides with her biological child and throws David to the wolves, as it were.<br />On another level this is a movie about a child's undying love for his mother, a love that lasts for two thousand years and a day and is never compromised.  It is about believing in fairy tales and the miraculous, a modern day Pinocchio in Wonderland as might be dreamed up by admirers of Blade Runner (1982).  In the Spielberg canon, echoes from his cinematic predecessors mesh with echoes from his own movies in a sometimes all too obvious way.  Note the return of the moon (in sinister splendor) from E.T. with Teddy (who could have been retrieved from the set of Blade Runner--as could Prof. Hobby, AKA Geppetto) trudging across the top of a rise in front of it.<br />The sets and the animations are sumptuous and beautiful.  The robots and the aliens are ingeniously crafted.  I very much liked the vision of a drowned Manhattan with the upper stories of the skyscrapers rising above the level of the sea (presumably from global warming), giving us a very quiet and almost contemplative Manhattan, and then the skyscrapers immersed in ice as the earth falls into a prolonged ice age.  The sense of the rapid passage of awesome time reminded me a bit of Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey (1968), while Dr. Know (voice of Robin Williams) recalled The Wizard of Oz (1939), and the Blue Fairy (voice of Meryl Streep) something from Disney.<br />This is a substantially compromised masterpiece, as it certainly had to be coming from the ghost of Kubrick as fashioned by Hollywood's most powerful and most commercially successful director, but an engaging, ambitious spiral into the future, one well worth watching one, one that will linger in the mind awhile.<br />See this to encourage Spielberg to emphasize creativity over formula, to encourage him to make more movies that dare to offend the mass mind while intriguing the rest of us.spiral into the future, one well worth watching one, one that will linger in the mind awhile.<br />See this to encourage Spielberg to emphasize creativity over formula, to encourage him to make more movies that dare to offend the mass mind while intriguing the rest of us.
B0000E1WKE|5.0|When I purchase Whitney Houston's &quot;One Wish&quot; album...All the good reviews, I've read about her product is true. Whitney really have out done herself on this christmas album. I have so many favorites on &quot;One Wish&quot; thats its so hard for me to just pick one that stands out. When I play Whitney Houston &quot;One Wish&quot; I keep it going from start to finish. I would recommend this Holiday cd to anyone its good.
0156027321|4.0|I found The Life of Pi to be actually rather slow in the beginning.  For the first 100 pages of the novel, I found myself wondering what the fuss was about.  It was the latter 230 pages or so that opened my eyes to the greatness of this book.  It's clearly one of the best, most intelligently-written, thoughtful books I've read this year.  <br />Pi's struggle for survival in the open sea is a story that I thought would be a struggle to make interesting for an extended period of time, but Martel really makes the story work.  Every hardship endured by Pi is felt profoundly by the reader.  Every struggle Pi goes through so thoroughly enraptures the reader that the ending is a complete, although logical and pleasant, surprise.<br />Martel does a wonderful job of giving the reader their choice of alternative endings.  The remarkable thing about this is how effortless he makes it appear.  This is a powerful story of the strength of the human spirit and what a person can do to survive.
0844663662|4.0|This book was rather interesting. This being the first book I have read by Vonnegut, I wondered if this would be a difficult book to read or not. &quot;Slaughterhouse Five&quot; was a fairly easy book to read, no more difficult than most others were. The most difficult part of this book was following the story. The story is told through the memories of a   day-dreamer. The story jumps around from topic to topic with the author popping in  with his own insight every so often, much as the mind of the main character Billy.<br />   The story of Billy Pilgrim twists and turns through experiences in his life that have greatly effected him, which you can see through out the book. Experiences such as the bombing of Dresden in 1945, a devastating plane crash, and other small but integral glimpses through out his past come back to haunt him in his daily life.  <BR>Coming in to this book I thought this was going to be a book about war, death, and other atrocities,  but was I fooled. As you read this book, you can tell this is anything but a tale of war. The subject of war was a traumatizing and atrocious part of his life, which furtherd the feeble, and weakening mental state of the character.<BR>While reading this book, I realized the lack of form in his writing and the spuratic thought paterns are used to futher illistrate the emense mental tolls on Billy`s mind.<BR>   To say I recommend this book is to say the least. The dynamics of this book take you through different emotional states, which help you relate to the character on a personel level as well as a phisical level.Although, the lack of form in his writing was new to me, it doesnt make the book any more dificult than most others. Since I have read this particular book from Vonnegut, I plan on reading more of his books to see if they are as interesting as this one.

B0000TB050|4.0|This is the same concert that aired on CBS last year. A very different edit though. I actually liked CBS' version better because it included greenroom interviews with Bono. In one he said that he buried his father the day before the concert. From there we see him on stage emotionally yelling into the mic for the intro of the song. It made a lot of sense and was quite moving. The DVD does not have this interview and Bono just looks like an animal yelling into the mic. No where on the DVD did it mention *specifically* the death of his father.<br />Basically the guys looked tired, probably due to Bono's father's death and the end of a long tour. The quality isn't great as they were not planning on releasing it. For early fans, you will appreciate the show for what it is. You will like the documentary of their early work in the castle and in the studio. For we later fans, well...just don't watch the documentary. It has permanently jaded my view of Bono and Adam.<br />If you were going to get just one DVD of the Elevation tour, I'd get Boston. Hands down. Techies and TV people will appreciate the behind the scenes work and the concert edit is incredible.
B000002UJQ|5.0|To put it simple I love this record, I listen to it regularly and find that it represents the peak output of Radiohead. After this one, Radioheads music changed. I recommend you to be open minded if you decide to get any of their later CDs.
B0000E6I1J|5.0|5 star rating - truly moving.<br />the highlights<br />* Jeff Lynne's reading on THE INNER LIGHT (do check it out, it is from disc one)<br />* Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers take on TAXMAN<br />* Eric Clapton, Billy Preston and all on ISN'T IT A PITY - (I think the stand out performance)<br />too bad Paul McCartney is becoming such a pampered publicity hound. of course he had to be the last guest to join the band on stage. also check out the end when he interupts Joe Brown on the finale. this you will see on the DVD. he just had to jump in front of the microphone to make one last stupid comment.<br />The DVD includes one track that didn't make it onto the CD which i thought was pretty good too!<br />If anyone knows why Bob Dylan wasn't there I would like to know.

The best four songs on the cd were &quot;Ride the Lightning&quot; &quot;Fade to Black&quot; &quot;For whom the bell tolls&quot; and &quot;Creeping Death&quot;. My favorite two songs from those four are creeping death and ride the lightning. The other four songs are still very good. Overall, Ride the Lightning is a great cd, and one of the best of Metallica.
B000000XCA|4.0|John C. Fogerty is the Huck Finn of rock n' roll (and for as long as he cared to, brother Tom served as his Tom Sawyer foil on rhythm guitar).  If Samuel Clemens were alive today, he no doubt would be toe tapping to 'Born On the Bayou' and laughing about Huck \\"runnin' through the backwoods bare\\" with his \\"old hounddog barkin'... chasing down a hoodoo there\\".  And J.C. delivers the vocals on 'Born...' with more gusto than even John Lennon summoned for his gravel-voiced marvel, 'Twist and Shout'.<br />This to me is the finest CCR album.  It doesn't have the most hit songs ('Proud Mary' was [and still is] mercilessly overplayed as a number two hit), but this set hit me square between the eyes between my freshman and sophomore years in high school.  I don't know if humans imprint, but indelibly etched in my brain cells is the memory of this album being played while I soaked up a warm summer evening at a beach on Lake St. Clair.  Some freaks in the parking lot had 'Born On the Bayou' blaring from their car stereo, and it was one of those moments in early adolescence when you savor your budding sense of autonomy.  Of course, in the early 1970's, all manner of freedom was breaking out everywhere, helping to frame this as a touchstone experience for me.<br />That's not to say there isn't great music on this album which speaks for itself.  'Born On the Bayou', 'Good Golly Miss Molly' (comparing it to Mitch Ryder's #4 hit version is like comparing apples and oranges, so I won't go there... suffice it to say that it rocks every bit as much, and features a driving lead guitar that cannot be denied), 'Bootleg', 'Penthouse Pauper', and 'Keep On Chooglin' (I guess they go chooglin' instead of truckin' down South) hold their own with any other highlights from Creedence albums.<br />Even more than their first album, 'Bayou Country' is a blues recording, with a thick overlay of the 'pop/swamp sound' that became their signiture.  'Bootleg' and 'Chooglin' are up-tempo blues, while 'Graveyard Train' (the only weak link in this set, and the primary reason this album is being denied 5 star status) and 'Penthouse Pauper' are more laid back.  Fogarty's lead guitar solo's bend, fold, and mutilate, and several songs also include John belting out mouth harp (I call it a harmonica) solo's as well.  Ironically, the 'odd-song out' is 'Proud Mary', the only composition (aside from 'Good Golly...') with enough 'pop' to make it a Top-40 candidate.<br />At under 35 minutes (8 1/2 claimed by 'Graveyard Train') this CD won't strain how you budget your time, so take the time to strain your budget to own it.  The album declared CCR to be a major playa, and together with 'Green River' and 'Cosmo's Factory', solidified their status as an elite band in rock n' roll's glory years.
0061015725|5.0|Of all the books in the world to pick up Prey would have to, at this time, be the most wonderful read.  It was very suspenseful and from the ending, right when they get stuck in the cars outside and must make it back to the lab, the book is non-stop intense, suspenseful, thrilling action.  It becomes irrisistable.  I find it amazing how it goes from starting with Jack at a grocery store buying placemats to him fighting nanotechnology with scientists.  <br />     Prey, as I said, starts off at a grocery store where the main character, Jack Forman, a stay-at-home dad caring for his children, is buying placemats for the house.  It goes on to tell how Jack begins suspecting an illicit affair arrising from his perculiarly acting wife Julia.  When Julia gets into a car accident and is taken to the hospital, Jack decides it's time to find out what's going on at her super hush-hush &quot;fab-lab&quot; called Xymos in the Nevada Dessert.  Upon arrival it seems that everyone is very uptight and worried and there are only a few people led by Jack's friend who is acting very odd.  <br />     Within the first day of arrival Jack is notified that the lab tried building nanorobots as spy cameras for the army.  When they escaped it was a hurry to find and collect these robots...they failed, and now they want Jack to help them to better understand these creations which are multiplying and getting much more dangerous by the hour.  Soon they are extremely technologically advanced yet if the people succeed is for you to read, and leads to the books amazing and climactic ending.<br />     This book wins me over on all fronts.  It was extremely well written and somehow manages to be extremely suspenseful and thrilling.  What the people decide is sometimes so out of the blue and so crazy that you can't believe they went through with it, but that is the beauty of this novel which keeps you riveted from nearly beginning to end.  Each new time zone/time frame of the novel delivers somethingnew to worry about and gives you a nice boost in your knowledge of technology and the worlds evolution.  Most people I know of that read it (which accounts for twelve people) love it and have already read it twice.  I'm now buying this book to own and read as many times as I want.  You'll fall in love with all the screams and suspense and thrills it delivers, and boy oh boy does Prey deliver.<br />     5 out of 5 stars. One of Michael Crichton's Very Best and second only to Jurassic Park.  It is on my top five Best Books Ever List as number four.  Outstanding.  A read well worth it.
B000002BE9|5.0|I love this album because it is not &quot;Britney Spears,&quot; get up and dance, snap your fingers music. &quot;Tidal&quot; represents the part of life that makes you sit down and hold your head in your hands, and it is a much needed breath of smokey air in a bubblegum society. Songs such as &quot;Sleep to Dream&quot; and the wonderful &quot;Shadowboxer&quot; show that this young woman has much to offer in the future.
B00005MNP8|5.0|The point where Blondie's mix of punk,pop and even disco came together like it never would again.<br />Blondie never was a true punk band,the keyboards they used and the occasional ballad they made set them apart from punk's most purist bands(Ramones,Wire)but made their appeal to the public larger,hence they sold more.But commercial doesn't necessarily mean worse as this finely crafted new wave masterpiece clearly shows.<br />HANGING ON THE TELEPHONE-Powerful and with a trully widescreen chorus.Blondie at its best.<br />ONE WAY OR ANOTHER-My personal favourite,has a great guitar riff and a darker chorus than they used to do.<br />PICTURE THIS-Poppier than the previous but still great.One of their best known tracks.<br />FADE AWAY AND RADIATE-Robert Fripp's distinctive guitar turns this ballad into something more,giving it an ethereal an slightly scary ambience.<br />PRETTY BABY-100% pop but still good,especially the guitar playing.<br />I KNOW BUT I DON'T KNOW-Strange song with Stein's backing vocals making their first and only appearance.Cool,though not the best in here.<br />11:59-A fast one.The keyboards are the standout here.Great.<br />WILL ANYTHING HAPPEN?-Outstanding speed and instrumental parts.Debbie's voice is here at its best(especially in the chorus).<br />SUNDAY GIRL-Another pop single filled with Debbie's sweet voice and dreamy keyboards.<br />HEART OF GLASS-Their most successful single yet.Could be called Debbie's song since it all here floats around her voice;only with a disco beat as backdrop to her singing.<br />I'M GONNA LOVE YOU TOO-Kinda silly but still acceptable.<br />JUST GO AWAY-Nice song with a touching feel of sadness to it.<br />Possibly the best album to come out of New Wave.
B0000DD7LB|5.0|&quot;Britney&quot; was a big step for Ms. Spears, but it was lacking. &quot;In the Zone&quot; is no artistic masterpiece, but a very pleasant album none the less. Up-beat tempos and naughty slow jams make this album a guilty pleasure, and just in time for the Holiday season. Not one for the children, but a feel good album for young adults.
B0000DD7NL|5.0|I was one of those people who thought that Songs in A Minor was good but not great and that the summer single \\"Streets of New York\\" was OK at best. But when I heard \\"You Don't Know My Name\\" drop I knew that The Diary of Alicia Keys was gonna be off the hook. <br />I love it when I'm right!!! <br />Words cannot express how good this album is. I have not stopped playing it since hearing it on AOL last week and subsequently buying it this week. Every song is excellent but standout cuts are: <br />#3 - Heartburn (Funkdafied flava)<BR>#5 - You Don't Know My Name (Old soul gold)<BR>#6 - If I Ain't Got You (Gorgeous lyrics, lush instrumentation, and beautiful vocals. The NEXT defining song of her career)<BR>#7 - Diary (Passionate)<BR>#11 - When You Really Love Someone (Deep)<BR>#12 - Feeling U, Feeling Me (Sexy)<BR>#13 - Slow Down (Cool)<BR>#15 - Nobody Not Really (Pure artistry)<br />Amazon needs to create more stars just for Alicia Keys. No one can touch her, so they may as well not even try. Now THIS is talent. (This should carry me until Jill Scott or India Arie drop their next releases.) <br />It took all year for the album of the year to get to us, but thank God it did.
B0000DD7LB|5.0|I still don't get why ppl hate to admit they're britney fans. I'm a big big britney fan ever since she came out with her first album and she's been improving ever since. This album is so different from the others. A bit of a disappointment for me as a brit fan but a great good surprise on the whole. <BR>Clearly, the onestar reviews were written by people who listened only to the samples or Britney haters.<BR>It;s a good album. I don't understand why ppl are writing about Britney's kiss with madonna here. It's a review column not a message board for pete's sake! Besides, the kiss was madonna's idea and she kissed Christina too. Why does britney have to get it all the time. Ans about posing for magazines, almost everyody does that sort of stuff. If you don't see your favorite stars posing like that doesn't mean they are dignified and Britney's not. It's just that they were never asked to pose for those sort of poses because noone's really interested to see them.<BR>Forget all that crap about Britney's image and all. The album is good and you should buy it.
B0000DJZA5|5.0|This is an album that the world has been waiting for forever now. Purists have been violently split over which is better: is the original &quot;Let It Be&quot; better because it was what was originally intended? Or was Spector's better because it rescued what was otherwise lousy performances?<br />My personal opinion: the answer is both.<br />John was absolutely correct when he says that Phil Spector took material that was recorded with a bad attitude and actually made something out of it. But it is also true that while I love Spector's production of, say, &quot;The Long and Winding Road&quot;, the original piano recording has a grace and poignancy that the other version lacks.<br />This recording does indeed show how exhausted The Beatles had become under the load of pressures and internal squabbles. At this point, they were bickering at each other so horrendously that they had no real enthusiasm (except maybe Paul) for the material, and this attitude shows in the material.<br />I give the album 5 stars because it is a historically signifigant recording and thus an important addition to The Beatles' catalogue. But which version of &quot;Let It Be&quot; is better? I can't accurately answer that question on a universal level, but in reality that question isn't really important. What must be of concern is that both versions are now available to the public, and buyers are now free to make up their own minds and enjoy whichever one pleases them best.
B000067CPX|2.0|This is not good chilli peppers music! It's simple- the songs they released from it are excellent and the rest of it is pants! Wait for the greatest hits album out soon- at least you get value for your money
0385504209|2.0|I would have enjoyed \\"DaVinci\\" a lot more if the basic premise had a leg to stand on.  It was disappointing, especially since I really liked \\"Angels and Demons\\".<br />Brown's protagonist, Robert Langdon, takes it as historic fact that Constantine the Great invented Christianity as we know it.  According to Langdon and his friend, Sir Leigh Teabing, Constantine decreed that Christianity would become the official religion of the Roman Empire at the Council of Nicea, and he decided which of the gospels would become canon and which were to be destroyed.  The marriage of Jesus to Mary Magdalene, and the existence of their child, was to be suppressed--by force, if necessary.<br />However, as any thirty-second search on the web will tell you, Constantine only *legalized* Christianity.  It was *Theodosius* who made Christianity the official religion of the empire about 65 years later.  In between them came Constantine's nephew, Julian the Apostate, who tried to dismantle Christianity during his brief reign.  Julian was convinced that it was his destiny to restore paganism to primacy.  Would he not have used Jesus' marriage to Mary Magdalene as part of his campaign to discredit the \\"myth\\" of the chaste, holy Jesus?<br />In addition, the bishops of Rome did not exert primacy over western Christendom until more than one hundred years after Constantine's death.  The Eastern patriarchs *never* accepted the authority of the bishops in Rome.  A monolithic Roman church, able to squash all dissent, simply didn't exist until maybe the time of Charlemagne, around A.D. 800.<br />In short, there were too many people, too many places, and too many years that the \\"secret\\" of Jesus' marriage to Mary Magdalene could have been preserved and spread for Brown's theory to work.  Suspension of disbelief requires throwing out basic facts of Western history that any intelligent person should have learned in high school.<br />I realize that Brown didn't set out to write a history, but the book would have been more enjoyable if Brown had done some basic research.  Even if he'd just made Theodosius the originator of the conspiracy, instead of Constantine, the plot would have been more plausible!<br />Finally, Brown's attacks on Christianity in general, and the Roman Catholic church in particular, go beyond what's required to advance the plot.  The book comes off as a thinly-veiled device to present pagan goddess worship as more spiritually pure and historically accurate than what's been preserved in the Bible and other first century sources.<br />But maybe that's why it's selling so well.d have been more enjoyable if Brown had done some basic research.

B0000029GA|4.0|No doubt about it this is the finest debut album ever made. I didn't give it 5 stars because it lacks good beats, but just listen to nas and you will know what all the hype is about. But i'm writing this in 2003 and would recommend that you buy this in the sale and listen to it and be impressed by the lyrical genius that you are listening to and then buy his latest album 'God's Son' and be totally amazed, because if one album beats this- it's that! For this album though, the lyrics you hear on this album will never quite be matched by another artist.
B0000DJZA5|4.0|So yeah, maybe Paul Mc Cartney tampered with history or maybe he just finally finished an album started all those years ago.  Either way, everybody wins!  Buy the one you like :)  I just wish there was a Mobile Fidelity version onn SA-CD!
0515127485|2.0|Archangel started out as good novel, but the author couldn't keep it up. There was too much down time and not enough action or mystery. The book overall is not very exciting. And the ending was rushed and incomplete. The author could have expanded more and made a better story. I felt as though he didn't have courage enough to finish the story. This book fell short of my expectations and I would not recommend on the fact that the ending will disappoint any reader.
B00005Y7L4|4.0|I thought the movie was awesome but I do recommend that you read the book first.  The characters may seem a bit juvenile and naive, even dispicable (i.e. Kazuo) but you'll understand better because the book goes into very descriptive details about each student.  The movie moved along much quicker than I expected and I guess for the sake of cinema they extracted only a few dramatic scenes from the storyline.  The one thing I have to point out is that the book dehumanized the adults but the movie made me sypathize with them a bit more.  Watch it you'll like it!
B00000JG41|5.0|Up until I heard &quot;The Director's Cut&quot; by Fantomas, I was never a fan of Mike Patton...at all. Really the only thing I'd heard from him at the time was some Faith No More, and it just didn't do it for me. But after hearing (and loving) Fantomas, I got the opportunity to see Tomahawk and the Melvins in concert. My main reason for going was to see the Melvins, but I stuck around for Tomahawk...and was absolutely floored. I bought both their albums on the spot at the show.<br />A couple weeks after that show, I had a party and a friend of mine was going on and on about &quot;California&quot; by Mr. Bungle. He couldn't impress upon me with enough emphasis that I HAD to hear this record. Ironically, I found it shortly thereafter in a bargain bin at a local CD store. The first time I listened to it, I wasn't able to digest it 'cause it was on in the background. I liked some of what I heard, but it didn't blow me away.<br />A few nights later, I was going to pay some bills and put some Bandai Godzilla gashapon figures together, so I decided to give this album another shot -- listening to the whole thing. By the beginning of the third song, I was absolutely engrossed in the record. I stopped what I had intended to do and just sat and listened to the rest of it. In my opinion, this album is the best album I've heard since &quot;Lateralus&quot; by TOOL came out, and this one was released in 1999. How the hell had I never heard this record?<br />I can't get enough of this album quite frankly. I recommend this record to anyone and everyone. If any record could ever be considered objectively &quot;good&quot;, it's this one.
B000068OSK|4.0|This is Rock &amp; Roll. I mean this is raw and meaningful rock. I felt like I was listening to a old 60's Classic Rock record. This is what I have been looking for for the past 2 years in Rock music. Jimmy The Exploder, Sugar Never Tasted So Good and Do are records that belong in their Obituary when they die as songs that can take the new sugar saturated Generation Y of today, and make them love raw real Rock Music. 4 stars only because i got a glimpse into the future first with White Blood Cell and Elephant and see that they top themselves over and over again!
B00005JKC3|4.0|Not the best movie in the whole wide world, and I can understand why alot of people didn't like it.  But in my opinion, it stayed more true to any comic, than any of the other comic book movies I've seen thus far.  And as all Ang Lee movies are; it's pretty slow moving, so be prepared.
0226264211|1.0|Seldom have I read something so stupid like this book. IT's badly written, false, it seems almost that the writer was paid by Wall Street to write it.<br />This is just capitalist junk written to attend capitalist's demands. Yeah, take the government away from every business on Earth, so we can take our profits freely and slave the poor population forever.<br />Man this book is so stupid it makes wanna vomit.
B0000BWVCM|4.0|Good movie, but it seems like the time it starts, it's all over.  I saw this and Matrix reloaded in the same day, and man, I thought this movie was twenty times better.  To bad it was overshadowed by Matrix's opening.  Definitely a good movie that's a must see for any action fan.
6305971145|5.0|I loved this movie.  The characters, Santa and his wife, were so well casted and you believed their story. I cry everytime they show him his sleigh for the first time and he flies away.  It does rate right up there with Miracle on 34th Street
B0000AXE8I|1.0|man, I hated this movie.  It seemed like there was so much pointless stuf in this movie.  Like, what's up with stupic rave sequence?  Was that necessary at all?  I agree, that the highway fight sequence was awesome, but otherwise, doesn't it seem like alot of this is reminiscent of dragonball z?
B000000OU0|4.0|The 4 stars are for the CD, 5 stars for the DVD.<br />Oooooo I felt compelled to write after reading the first few abject comments! (please forgive me if I repeat others, as I have only read a few reviews)<br />I bought the album a few years ago (after seeing the concert on VH1) and it is one of my all time faviorites, and have yet to tire of it.<br />To put it simply.......if you consider yourself to be an audiophile I cannot see why you would not rate the album as stunning.<br />These guy's musicianship is AWESOME ... and deserve our unreserved respect. This album is true music, but even better is the DVD.........<br />Now that is really stunning!<br />All the old faviorites are there and performed, in my view better when heard live.<br />The extra tracks include, Help Me Through The Night (Joe Walsh).<BR>Beautiful ballad (if you don't like ballads, you won't like the album).<br />The Heart Of The Matter (my faviorite along with The Last Resort)<BR>sung and co written by Don Henley is gorgeous and shows the band's wonderful voices and how they all blend together beautifully.<br />Awwwwwww bands just don't come like these any more!<br />I unreservedly recommend the DVD as a classic. In fact, that disc (on it's own) convinced me to invest a considerable amount of money on a home cinema set up and it was well worth it.<br />Hey, get them both..............brilliant!
0385504209|5.0|I could not put this book down.  What a great many things to think about!  There are a lot of interesting theories presented.  I would recommend this book!
B00005JLD4|5.0|I think I was equally moved at the story of how these three girls with no acting experience were chosen to do this movie and after I watched it was compelled to watch the movie again!  This was a tour de force for the director and, I hope, his best experience making a movie in his homeland.  I have seen it 4 times and everyone I have loaned the DVD to has watched it over and over.  I have bought movies that are entertaining, but this is one of the best and when I show it for company, just as another reviewer said, they are so drawn into it they never leave their seats and there are discussions long after the movie is over.  This is definitely a favorite!!!
B00009TB5G|5.0|Well gee....P.J and Co. only spent 7 years of their lives putting LOTR on the screen. Instead of screaming about this change and whining about that change, why not try sitting back and just enjoying this story. That's all it is, folks. A story!! If the book had been followed to the letter the movies would have been horrendously boring and rambling. Tolkien takes pages just to describe a road fercripessakes!! Sharpening up the plot, eliminating superfluous content and tightening the tension between characters is essential in keeping the viewer(NOT reader)interested. For example, if Faramir had simply met Frodo and Friends in the woods and let him go on his merry way, the power of the ring would have really been demonstrated, wouldn't it? Nope! Books and movies belong to completely different worlds. Purists need to figure out how to see beyond the frontispiece and expand their ideas of interpretation and possibility. <br />/end rant.
B000089RVX|1.0|Then I thought with Avril Lavinge, Justin Timberlake, Britney Spears, Simple Plan and 50 Cent can music get any worse? And then Evanescence comes along.  Seriously where are all the one stars? Where are all the bad reviews? Why are people even calling this nu metal or goth? This is plain r&amp;b whith a bad annoying voice, guitars and they throw that with good lyrics. I admit  the lyrics are good but everything I mean come on? Why do people listen to artifcial crap like this? The media trys to get teenies listen to Avril and Evanescence calling it 'the new wave' or whatever. Music use to be good but once the 21st century came roop music went. One good bad I say is worth while that is new is The Strokes. About two years new they are but ver real.
B00005JM02|4.0|I've never seen a more heart-filled, will-powered, animated production such as Finding Nemo. Slithering slowly upright to the edge of my seat, I felt the amount of fear Nemo father's heart embedded when Nemo disappeared. It was as if Nemo's father and I were both on this never ending search to bring Nemo back home.<BR> Nemo's father displayed the strength of his will to find his son as any loving father would. Nemo's father never gave up and once he felt like there as no hope left, his cries were answered. Although finding Nemo is a cartoon, it relates to everyday situations. It lets people know that no matter how hard or impossible a situation might seem, ther is always an answer and a way out.<BR> When Nemo's father found Nemo, it brought tears of joy to my eyes. To know that Nemo's father never gave up hope,inspired me to have a strong will through all of my triumphs. I know it will touch the hearts of many parents as well as bring entertainment to children.<BR> This movie also teaches children about disobedience. Nemo didn't listen to his father and got lost. Luckily he was found, but no telling what could have happened to him if he wasn't found. Parents are only here to help and love their child. I believe that the message was very well stated throughout the movie.<BR> Finding Neomo is a movie that everyone can learn something from. Not to mention the excitement and adventure that comes along with it. This movie teaches many lesson and brings families closer. Finding Nemo will always be rated number one on my scale!
0671449028|5.0|My daughter and I love this book. I have it memorized and often recite it to her at bedtime while she is drifting off to sleep. I think that this book is a must for anyone with small children. I must admit, I'm a bit concerned about those reviewers who express concern about the realism in book. If they are so concerned about excerising after bathing, shouldn't they also be concerned about animals that can brush their teeth? I mean, it is a children's book!
B000089CJI|1.0|This sounds like songs an 8 year old would make on one of those Casio pre-programmed keyboards.  Add a few wimpy guitar lines and the \\"sensitive\\" vocals of that chubby guy from Death Cab and that's all this band is:  boring.
B0000WN0ZK|5.0|I first saw this film while in college, and was fascinated with its message, plot and cinematography. I still am. I love the illusion-versus-reality central theme, and its development through the twin vehicles of photography and the mime troupe. I was, and am, completely enthralled by the sound and cinematography of the park/murder scene with David Hemmings and Vanessa Redgrave. But, I'm a photographer, and Antonioni's development of the plot through the sequential enlargement of photos resonated with me more than it might with others. It's also fun to see the Yardbirds in a cameo role, when they had both Jeff Beck and Jimmy Page playing guitars. One of my favorites, and, hopefully, the long-overdue DVD will feature the great sound and video that the film deserves.
0694003611|5.0|I wasn't surprised when the kid wanted to hear the book over & over. I wasn't surprised that I ended up memorizing the text. I WAS surprised, that on a particularly fussy car ride, with no book in sight, when I started quoting the thing from desparation, the kid fell asleep. The effect has been repeated, though not quite as dramatic every time.<br />\\"As effective as codine, but not narcotic\\"<br />And I liked looking for the mouse.
B00004LN16|4.0|Wish I could say AC/DC gets better with age, raelly they don't change much, having survived for 30+ years is an amasing feat for any band.  This group has had it's ups and downs, and this cd hits just a little above the middle, just about where are their songs aim for anyway.  STIFF LUPPER LIP is the best song on this cd, and there are few others too.  Nothing on here that's another YOU SHOOK ME ALL NIGHT LONG, or DIRTY DEEDS, but all are listenable except for DAMNED and SATELLITE BLUES.  Cd is a little long for them 13 songs, could have 2 or 3 songs shorter and had a better cd.  Good production on this cd makes the music go down better.
0688156819|5.0|I don't know if the book could be any better although I wish it would have more pages of Burton's unusually magical works.  I think this would be a great book to read to children.  The stories would teach them about diversity, life and acceptance.  For adults, this book would be quite entertaining.  This is one of those books that you should get and keep within the family as a treasure for future generations.  I hope you enjoy it as much I did.
B00009MGR6|3.0|AC/DC has always had a problem of their music sounding like music off any other of their cds, with lyrics changed.  You get the same feeling upon listening to this cd.  But this time around, unlike their last 2 studio cds, they have more than one good song on the cd, they have 3.  THIS MEANS WAR, THAT'S THE WAY I WANT TO ROCK-N-ROLL, and HEATSEEKER.  This time also Johnson, sounds like he is singing with the gusto of his first two cds with the band.  Prodution is also better on this cd.  But for the rest of the cd, same old AC/DC.
B00006879E|5.0|this CD is a very good way to mix 2 diffrent kinds of music. they do a good job in giving people what they wont in a song. if there are people who like more then one kind of song this is the CD to do it. its so much fun to dance to and sing at the top of your lungs!
B00008WT5M|5.0|AC/DC returns to top form with this cd.  From the opening credits of THUNDERSTRUCK, you know your in for a ride.  And the songs keep coming and keep the pace up.  Only a couple of stinkers on this cd, MISTRESS FOR CHRISTMAS, and GOODBYE AND GOOD RIDDANCE TO BAD LUCK.  The songs are sharp and crisp, with the best beat I've ever heard on an AC/DC cd.  Production is the best since Mutt Lange left several cds back.  Which could mean AC/DC is only as good as their producer.  Lyrics are less on drugs and booze this time, which a good change of pace.  Indeed a welcome return for the boys down under.
B0000DD7LB|1.0|Another hodgepodge of unlistenable beats and the prime example of the lowest common denominator of pop music. Why do I need to go into a 900 word review on this?<br />If you agree with me, vote yes. If not, vote no. Thanks!
B000127LW2|5.0|At last, Voyager on DVD! This is, to me, the best of all the Star Trek series (except for the current Enterprise, which is excellent and getting better every week). I've always loved strong women and Janeway is a great character played by a great actress.<br />Now, for the price... I think the price is well worth it for what you are getting. Sure, it was a short season, but it was a great season. And the extras on this set makes the price more than worth it. I never thought I would ever see Bujold clips that were filmed. The angels must have smiled when Bujold quit because I can't imagine anyone but Mulgrew playing Janeway.<br />All the characters were great, and the story lines were thought provoking and exciting. This is a show I can watch over and over and over.<br />(...).<br />Thank you Paramount for finally releasing the BEST Trek series!
0385335482|5.0|I honestly thought this book was brilliant.... <br />Once I started reading I couldn't put it down.  It is written with an incredible British humour (Bridget Jones type... but  funnier), plus it is filled with very realistic situations, and real life places making it easier to picture.<br />The book is about the very complicated life of a superficial Becky Bloomwood, who lives to shop and shops to live... <BR>What I loved about her was that she could be anyone... of course... she goes a bit too far.. but I am sure most of us have used our credit cards when we shouldn't have, or  bought things we didnt actually need but convinced ourselves we couldn't keep breathing is we didn't have them, and afterwards couldn't figure out how to pay for them, and so on...<br />The book is also filled  with very specific details (which proves the author did some research concerning shops and prices) and is, in my opinion a wonderful insight into Becky's  mind, especially when trying to justify her shopping habits.... simply fabulous!!  <BR> <BR>It kept me laughing from cover to cover... and thats a bit hard to achieve.<br />READ IT!  You won't regret it!!!
B0000VCZK2|3.0|The picture-quality is beautiful on all disks. The extras are great. The sound is superb. There really isn't more you could want. The problem is overkill. At what point is too much simply \\"too much\\"?<br />I mainly bought the set for the 2003 Director's Cut of the original \\"Alien\\" from 1979. This is the director's cut of the film that was screened in theaters in the Fall of 2003. Primarily, I was interested in the restored image from the original negative and as I compared this with a previous DVD release, there is recognizable improvements in picture-quality (less grain, better highlights, sharper image, blacker blacks, etc). The original Ridley Scott \\"Alien\\" is one of my all-time favorite movies - and it has never looked or sounded better! Watch the brilliant bright reds of the splattering blood from the now legendary kitchen scene and you'll see \\"Alien\\" like you haven't before. <br />I am not as much of a fan of the sequels, as they work primarily as science-fiction films exclusively, nor do any of them stand-up on their own. For better or worse, sequels were eminant in any case; but let it be said that none of them live up to even half of the brilliance of the original 1979 Ridley Scott masterpiece, some being completely silly and others being just average.<br />The decision to originally make a B-rated monster movie into an \\"A\\" movie of the highest quality was a major innovation and brought back a level of film as a thrilling good time. (We must remember that the original Universal Studios monsters films from the 30s and 40s were not \\"B\\" films in their day, but big-budget blockbusters).<br />I do think that 9 disks is a little ridiculous, nor will I likely ever bother to even view half of the footage included in this box set. It's entirely overkill to the point of decreasing impact rather than strengthening it. I would safely guestimate that over 50% of the material presented in this box set is unecessary and you wouldn't likely ever watch it.<br />The packaging, (I completely agree with one reviewer here), is too creative and structurally isn't sound. Why not just give us 4 clamshell boxes inside a strong outer box? The roll-out of 9 disks is absurd and cumbersome, and because of the weight the glue starts to give and your CD caddy will soon come apart. It's a valuable lesson in how NOT to package DVDs! Please don't get too creative with packaging.<br />Personally, I wouldn't spend the money UNLESS you absolutely adore the ENTIRE \\"Alien\\" series, (or are Sigourney Weaver's mother). Otherwise, you'll be left with WAY too much info and extras and stuff. Otherwise, just buy the films indivdually. Case in point: these remastered director's special editions will be available in early 2004 individually.<br />In my opinion, only the first 1979 original \\"Alien\\" is a great film. The sequels are Saturday afternoon rainy-day fare, and don't make the exhorbitant fee worth it in the end.
B0000CDLA7|4.0|Why are all these people writing reviews about how it is an unexpected album.  If you had truly listened to 6DOIT, you should have seen it coming!  This CD isn't supposed to have any hidden guidelines or rules, it's just a straight forward, heavy rockin album.  6DOIT was a killer album, and so is this.  The direction they're are going in is the right one.  Afterall, they are a PROGRESSIVE rock band, they are progressing.  But if you want to listen to the bad reviewers, go right ahead and miss out on one of the albums of the year.
B0000AUHQT|4.0|I don't know if I agree with most reviwers here. I rather enjoyed this rendition of the great novel by F. Scott Fitzgerald. I just read the book for the first time in my life several weeks prior to watching this film [also for the first time], so it was fresh in my memory. I found the movie to be fairly acurrate to the book in most ways, even in tone.<br />In my opinion, the novel &quot;The Great Gatsby&quot; is one of those art pieces that, like the Disco music and leisure suits of the 1970s, hasn't dated well. But that, is precisely what keeps it alive now. For better or worse, there are fewer things created during &quot;the roaring twenties&quot; that define the era in present-day peoples' imaginations more than &quot;the Great Gatsby&quot; by F. Scott Fitzgerald.<br />But what I wonder, is how relevent this story is anymore? Perhaps it's the story of the Great Gatsby that fails to move modern audiences any longer that makes this film not the masterpiece that it should be? I wondered that as I watched this movie. Because all the elements are superb: Robert Redford is inspired as Gatsby and all the casting, the costuming, the music, etc is wonderful here. This is a strong film! In other words, I am suggesting that if the film bores you, so would the original novel likely bore you as well.<br />The DVD is fine - it isn't a spectacular treatment, nor are there an overwhelming amount of extras, etc. But the picture-quality is nice and the sound is average for a modern-day DVD. I can't call it a five-star DVD restoration, but nor is it a bad treatment either. The low price makes it accesible. It's a perfectly fine DVD.
B00004Y635|4.0|this is a good trilogy..becuase it has style and originality. This one envolves Sydney Prescott(Neve Campbell) again and this time its personal. another Stab movie is in production and the actors are getting bumped off one by one and who happens to work on the movie set then Dewey(Arquette). He is teamed up again with Gail Weathers(Cox Arquette) and Prescott and also a cop played by Patrick Dempsey..who becomes Sydney's boyfriend in the end and in the beginning we see Liev Schreiber(Cotton Weary) get killed off in this one. other actors include Matt Kesslar,  Jenny McCarthy, Patrick Warburton, Deon Richmond, Emily Mortimer, Kelly Rutheford, Scott Foley(who is the killer), Lance Henrikson, Jamie Kennedy, Heather Matarazzo, Parker Posey and cameos by Kevin Smith and Jason Mewes(Jay and Silent Bob). more chills and thrills till the very end where the secret of all the clues unravel. dont miss it
B0000BWVCM|5.0|Although I was very hesitant about a Bryan Singer-directed version of X-Men, this series is the first comic adaptation since Batman to be truely faithful to the comics.  And the great thing is that it makes for an excellent movie. As with Aliens and Godfather 2, the sequel is just as good, if not better than the original.  Wolverine's background is explored and the film endsw with an incredible climatic battle scene.<br />Since I don't own the DVD yet, I can only speak for the quality of the film. But if X-Men 1.5 and the list of extra features is any indication, the DVD looks like an excellent product.
0790739356|3.0|filled with some great action scenes including the part where Russell emerges out of the water and guns down a lot of guards. but the laging is the other people like Jason Issaacs and Gary Busey. for Russell fans and he's really not talkative that much in this one up until the point where he talks.
B00008PW2E|5.0|This is the best show/series I have seen in HBO besides that of OZ, which i am also anticipating the release of the third season dvd in feb of 2004, but Six Feet Under is the best, i love the story and how it portrays death and life, release this, people are &quot;dying&quot; to see it, no pun intended
630505116X|3.0|some good moments in a film directed by Stephen Sommers(directed the dreadful Mummy movies). this one is his best one so far with Treat Williams and Wes Studi and Studi's shipmates and Williams crew go and highjack a luxury cruiseliner but find something different on board thats eatting alive all the crew. so they race against time and try to stop it and survive. Kevin J. O'Connor sparks some laughs alongside Williams. dont get to caught up in the moment, the beast at the end is stupid but the ship exploding is great and Anthony Heald is way funky in this pic.
B0000CDLA7|1.0|DT said they felt under pressure writing Falling into Infinity, and that they almost broke up after that tour. Well, that album still sounded great.<BR>What kind of pressure must they be under now, for writing such horrible stuff? The pressure of selling more? The pressure of their brainwashed american minds? Yuck!
6304244347|1.0|come on people, 5 stars for this junk. yes it has Val Kilmer and Marlon Brando in it but they dont save it, not by a long shot. it starts off good but then when they get into all that beast and grotesque situations..it downs the movie big time and did we have to see that mother beast giving birth I mean come on now!! the only good part is when Kilmer's and Brando's characters die. a mess of a movie
6305882592|2.0|after seeing this movie, i was scared.  not screaming at the top of my lungs scared, but the scared where you sit there and think - oh my goodness.  this movie is about a rich teenage boy (harold) who is obsessed with death.  he attempts suicide multiple times and likes going to funerals.  then he meets an old lady (maude) at a funeral and falls madly in love with her.  theres gap of over 60 years between them, but they fall in love.  it was horrifing in my opinion.
6303109950|5.0|Kurt Russell(Dark Blue, Breakdown) is Wyatt Erpp and Val Kilmer(Gore Vidal's Billy the Kid, The Salton Sea) is Doc Holiday...how great can that get...with great shootouts and some fantastic direction..this one makes a bullseye... Kilmer as the drunken Holiday is great and he perfectly imbodies him..plus when he kills Michael Biehn(The Terminator, NAVYseals) that was good..and Russell and his gang trapping Powers Boothe(Frailty, U-Turn) and gunning him down was also great as well. other cast members include Dana Delany(Exit to Eden), Sam Elliott(The Hulk), Bill Paxton(A Simple Plan), Jason Preistley(Calendar Girl), Charlton Heston(Any given Sunday), Stephen Lang(Eye See You), Thomas Haden Church(George Of The hungle), Billy Bob Thornton(Bandits), Jon Tenney, Harry Carrey jr, Joanna Pacula, Michael Rooker(Rosewood), Billy Zane(Dead Calm), Robert John Burke(Fled), Paul Ben Victor, John Corbett(Tv's Lucky), Robert Mitchum and many others. a round um up..shoot um up good time.
B00005K3OT|2.0|Any film that combines Juliette Binoche with Johnny Depp seems worth seeing just for the absurdity factor. This one is *such* a Hollywood-esque take on small-town French life. You know you're in trouble when the opening voice-over (in English, as is the entire film) describes the &quot;tranquillite'&quot; of the village ... and then feels compelled to translate &quot;tranquillite'&quot; into English. And then there's the foolishness of Johnny Depp playing an Irish traveler who plays steel guitar - including a very uptown version of Django's &quot;Minor Swing&quot;.      This is another example of an interesting and slightly strange slice of European life made innocuous and comforting for American audiences.      Nonetheless, I'll confess that the film is fun, predictable fluff. It's probably worth watching on a flight to Europe, if only because your actual experiences there will be *so* much more thought-provoking and rewarding.
6305089957|4.0|the second serving is thrilling and great but the badguy or I should say badwoman is a let down. the cast includes Neve Campbell, David Arquette, Courteney Cox, Jamie Kennedy, Sarah Michelle Gellar, Elise Neal, Timothy Olyphant, Laurie Metcalf, Portia deRossi, Rebecca Gayheart, Duane Martin, Jada Pinkett Smith, Jerry O'Connell, Joshua Jackson, Liev Schrieber, Luke Wilson, Tori Spelling, Heather Graham, Omar Epps and many others star in this successful sequel. Laurie Metcalf as the killer, come on..Timothy Olypahnt was doing just fine until you had to pop in. dont miss it.
B00005U2JL|5.0|HOLY FU*KING SH*T!!! (pardon my French) Can you say explicit!? The warning on the cover isn't nearly big enough. This DVD would probably burn up if holy water was cast on it... But I don't friggin' care! This is the best DVD ever! Despite what your local priest tells you, Manson Rocks! I would of enjoyed it more if it were from one whole concert instead of each song being cut from a different one. Theres a Hell of a lotta' explicit content on this DVD, In the extra &quot;The Death Parade&quot; 30 minute documentry. you'll see everything from Manson and Twiggy setting a dressing room on fire, to Manson getting John5 two chicks (im not quite sure if they were hookers) for his birthday (I personally prefered Daisy Berkowitz as a guitarist). <BR>Anyway... This footage is pretty good, Manson pulls down his pants showing his arse to the crowd (that may seem weird to you, but its awsome to me). In conclusion... If your a manson fan, <BR>GO FOR IT!!!, if your not a Manson fan, and not very open minded. Don't. If your under 13, and a Manson fan get it anyway... fin
B00005QDW1|1.0|I know this has been said countless times, but is this the same group that did the past four albums? It can't be. I grew up listening to this band, Tragic Kingdom was the first album I ever bought, back when I was just nine years old. But now, they've gone from ska to......hip hop? Are you people deaf? How can you say they DIDN'T sell out? Why would they even think of doing something like going hip hop? How would they think their rock fans were going to react to this? What would the late Sublime frontman Bradley Nowell say if he saw them today? Even by standards of pop, or hip hop, or whatever this crap is called, it's still awful. The lyrics downright horrible (refer to \\"Hey Baby\\"), they have reggae singers now (remember, this used to be a ska band) and the songs have awful hip hop beats. What the hell? Sure, they're more popular now than ever, more power to them, then. They were obviously shooting for a teeny-bopper image instead, and that's just what they got. I wouldn't be surprised to see them on tour with Justin Timberlake and/or Britney Spears sometime soon (if they haven't already).<br />R.I.P. - No Doubt
B00008J4P5|1.0|It's hard to believe Rolling Stone acts like the White Stripes are the saviors of rock.  Two words: passing fad.  Minimalistic is another word for lazy and talentless.  <BR>Strong reccomendation to avoid.
B0000DD7LB|1.0|This has basically nothing of musical content worth listening to. &quot;Everytime&quot; is respectable but it's more a song for someone like Celine Dion.  Britney stuggles to get it out.  The rest of the CD is junk.  Personally, I really like Britney.  But, this is really bad.  She should stick to the style she's good at.  Forget the notion of an &quot;image makeover&quot;. She can't be something she's not. The supporting cast is to blame for trying to force that issue.  Reflects the pathetic state of the music industry in general.  Don't waste your money on this one.
0140042520|3.0|Westerners tend to have under-adjusted encounters with Buddhism, because they are usually attached to the `idea' of their being detached-- a fallacy because Buddhism asserts the `end of self' altogether. Thus, it is difficult to write about Buddhism in a western context, especially in a first person narrative, which is what Kerouac rather successfully has done. Kerouac is self-aware of this dynamic and creates two characters (Ray and Japhy) who start off traveling together, but become more adverse as their philosophies clash. Japhy becomes deeply attached, almost smug, to his spiritual evolution, while the more modest Ray continues the search for self, without the stringent belief system of his former companion. Readers may find it a tad convenient that Kerouac appropriate himself as the closer to truth Ray. Whatever the case, the polarity is an affective device.<br />Similar to On The Road, Kerouac writes with ease and eloquence, and at times, profound insights. Some of the more predictable scenes in the book feature hippy parties, road trips, and drug use, for which the author is famous. However, the book is just as full of sweet, quirky, and new ideas on Zen Buddhism that are slipped in between the sentences, along with a dozen or so lovely haikus. The crucial redeeming quality with this book is that Ray doesn't become too heady or obsessed with his philosophical inclinations. He simply goes about his way, making light comments about things without becoming the author's mouthpiece, an unfortunate aspect of many books.<br />From Oregon, California, Ohio, and the Carolinas (to name a few), Ray ends up home with his family, a failure in the context of the bohemian life he strived for. It is at this unlikely place he undergoes an experience that perhaps is as close and earnest as one can ever get to a selfless experience.<br />Kerourac manages to write a book about truth and God without being pedantic or self-righteous. Ray is humble and friendly, so readers are notintimidated, rather, they are that much more eager to join the quest. This is a warm, hope filled, and youthful novel written by an author who embodies the search in all of us.
B00005JME0|4.0|I had the opportunity to see \\"The Butterfly Effect\\", and this could well be the movie that will take Kutcher to a new level in acting. The plot was complicated, spanning a lifetime. It is based on the theory that the flutter of a butterfly's wings can result in a tsunami on the other side of the world and someones's birth can have the same ripple effect. Thru' time travel Kutcher replays his life over and over again until he rights the negative effects of his birth. I would be interested to know what ending they used for the movie, as I viewed the director's cut. I was told that the movie slated for release has a different ending. I HOPE NOT!! The ending I saw tied the whole plot together and made for a very good story. Didn't get up to pee once!!
B0000DZ3IG|4.0|I loved this movie and especially the music.  I felt that there were songs on this cd that were not in the film (and I've seen it six times), and that there were songs in the film that should have been on the cd.<br />I ended up getting the UK soundtrack as well.  The UK version has  a different version of &quot;Jump for my love&quot; (a really rockin' version!!!) that is by &quot;Girls Aloud&quot;, it has the whole song of &quot;sweetest goodbye&quot; (for some stupid reason the US version cuts it off halfway through to go into some other song), it has some other song I don't remember from the flick called &quot;sometimes&quot;, plus two orchestral themes that are not on the US soundtrack. <br />What kills me is that neither soundtrack has the opening theme, the one that branches off from the &quot;christmas is all around&quot; recording scene.  It's such a great piece! But then, I'm a music freak and most people probably don't even care or notice.  But I miss it and it drives me nuts that I can't hear it without going back to the theatre.
B0000DJZA5|5.0|I haven't stopped listening to this CD.  I LOVE it!  I have loved the Beatles ever since I was in my crib, and I've always loved Let It Be, but this cleaned up version, where you can actually hear the Beatles and the way the songs were written, WOW!  John singing Across The Universe is awesome, and I never particularly cared for I Dig A Pony, but it is SO GOOD on this CD!  And I LOVE Don't Bring Me Down.  John, Paul, and George are all in GREAT voice, and I just have to say that I am SO HAPPY that I bought this CD!
B0000AXE8I|5.0|Matrix Reloaded DVD<br />Let me see how I can define what I think about Matrix Reloaded... Let's say that it was simply the most wonderful movie I've ever seen, absolutely fantastic. It is not exactly how I felt because what I felt is just beyond words, but let's keep moving on... You probably have already heard about Matrix otherwise you're not from this world, anyway let's see what Matrix Reloaded is all about. Basically it is the 2nd movie from the trilogy and it revolves around Zion (the last human city). Neo, Trinity and Morpheus have to save the city, but to accomplish that mission Neo has to fight Smith and his clones. There are some other interesting scenes but to know about them you'd better watch it!!<br />Now talking about the DVD itself. Never again will I see such a complete DVD. Let's say it is complete because of the Special Features included in the second CD. For you to have a certain idea of how complete it is they've included the MTV Movie Awards parody of the movie, and a commercial designed on the film. There are some other special features that show the production of the trilogy, such as the Highway Pursuit and some interviews with the actors, producers and directors.<br />I think that's what I could say about this incredible movie. All we have to do is wait for the end of the trilogy. Like the poster of the 3rd movie says \\"everything that has a beginning has an end\\". All we have to do is wait for it!!!
B0000C6E4D|5.0|While not always an active listener of her, I've always respected Sarah not only for her voice, but for her sonwriting talent and unparalleled aesthetic.  She has always seemed not only completely serious about her music, but amazingly comfortable as well.  I've always suspected she is a closet perfectionist.  Her music seems carefully crafted and sculpted to the slighted nuance - no loose ends here.  Not only that, but she is the only person who has pulled off a cover of Tom Waits' &quot;Ol' 55&quot;, and managed to make it her own.<br />I dont' know what Sarah was doing over the five years since her last album, but it seems to have worked for her, giving us what is almost surely the best and most mature album of her career.   Her music retains the same beauty we've come to expect, but it is hardly stale and recycled material, while still retaining her distinctive touch.  Old fans needn't worry about radical changes, nor need they worry about &quot;Fumbling Towards Ecstacy part 2&quot;, or &quot;Surfacing Once Again&quot;.  If i'm any judge of artistic talent, and I like to think that I am, Sarah is only getting better with time, and &quot;Afterglow&quot;, I hope, despite its title, is only the beginning of what will almost surely be her best work.  Let's only hope that we won't have to wait another five years.<br />Perhaps the best testament I can give to this album's power is this - I work in a bookstore where this is one of the promo cds we were given to play in the store.  On any given day, I hear this album three or four times, on a given week - twelve to twenty times.  It's safe to say I've heard this album around 50 times in the past month, and I love it even more every time I hear it.  Every other cd we play I am either sick of or indifferent to at this point, but I still always look forward to this one.
B00005UOXL|5.0|New Wave may have been on the way in and punk may have been receding (for a bit) when Billy Idol released this, his solo debut album, but both gained new ground because of this album's release.<br />Those may sound like strong words for a solo album from someone that many either revile or revere.  But that is exactly the case.<br />Billy Idol announced his presence with a snarl.  He was no longer a pretty boy stuck in a punk band (Generation X), nor was he a pretty boy playing synthesizers ala Duran Duran (who would come later).  Billy Idol carved a niche for himself.<br />Today, many people consider his music to be hard rock rather than either punk or new wave.  And while that is probably a fair assessment, Billy Idol never rested on his laurels and gave us the same type of music for too long.<br />On this album, as I said before, his solo debut, Billy gives us the chart topper - White Wedding  - and a song from his former group (Generation X): Dancing with Myself.  These are only two of the great songs on this album, but they are the most easily recognizable by those not familiar with his music.<br />This album no doubt gained even more popular play and attention due to Billy's snarling good looks and the fact that it was released just as MTV was debuting, allowing the world to experience the visual experience of White Wedding.<br />Not all of this albums songs are &quot;hits&quot;, but none of them is bad.  Often gritty, and frequently obnoxious, &quot;Billy Idol&quot; is a music &quot;must have&quot; for anyone serious about ground breaking music.
B0000DD7NL|4.0|I have to admit that when I first bought this album I was still on a high from YDKMN and so I was expecting everything to sound like this. Truthfully, it took me at the most-five spins to really get into EVERY song on the album and once I did, it was like a door opened up for me. Where her first album was r&amp;b/hip-hop tinged with old school, this album is more old-school tinged with hip-hop/r&amp;b. I love Harlem's Nocture, because it is very similar to the intro track on the first album. My other favorites are &quot;Diary&quot;(LOVELOVE this song),&quot;Slow Down&quot;,&quot;Dragon Days&quot;,&quot;Nobody Not Really&quot;(even if it is only an interlude-a three minute one at that) and &quot;When You Really Love Someone&quot;. The rest of the album is an absolute confection of sounds. I agree with another reviewer when they said they wanted more piano, but the album is still perfect.
B00008XEOI|5.0|OK... the extended version sucked... but duh that's why they cut the extra stuff... the platinum version is remastered in dolby 5.1 that should be in itself worth the extra bucks... and the special features... there's all these &quot;adults telling you that they're boring and dumb... the movies from Disney... he was a communist what do you expect?... Lion King still is king of the Plains... so you better recognize!!
B000003TAL|5.0|A gentle guitar riff, joined by Kim Gordon's sweet mumbling, obliterated by a silver riff of indie magic.  From the sky, an epic falls, Thurston's rant for the ages, it gets busy in his city head, takes a teenage riot to get him out of bed.  Riding the silver rocket, slicing titanium riffs crushed beautifully by cacophony's white slate, you can't stop it.  Sprawl of genius, Kim's store from which you can never buy enough, shuffling, grinding harmonies elevating a story to the highest heights.  Across the breeze, sailing on a minor key through crystalline beginnings, finding the source of genius,  I wanna know--should I stay or go?  Lee's brilliant Eric, he cares only about himself, that's enough, just me and that's all.  The profundity of total trash, grinding axes into wondrous dust.  Joni leaving it all behind, finding something even better, back in 1963, putting it all behind her.  A candle for the ages, a light in the darkness of the 80s.  King of the rain, Thurston's thunderstorm of discordancy.  Yet, darkness with a strange kissability, an admirable feat of genius.  Wonders and hyperstations, riding hazy melodies into space, eliminating the competition, reaching a plane of purest daydreams, a nation unto themselves.
B0000DD7NL|4.0|I really like this album because of the musicality.  The song's don't use the current &quot;pop&quot; formula that usually leads to predictability of songs on today's radio stations.  Each song has its own unique surprises which adds structure to the songs. I appreciate the time spent perfecting the quality of these tracks. You can tell how much feeling has gone into the writing of these songs.  I think Clive Davis said it best when he stated that you can't force real musicians to create music quickly. They are constantly creating, and when it is complete, they will let YOU know.  I'm glad that she's with a label that gives her time to adequately create music like this.  However, with every CD that you purchase, there are some songs you will like and some you won't.  I reserve my 5 star rating for CDs with all tracks favorable or with no more than 2 tracks unfavorable.  So keep it up Alicia, and we'll be ready and waiting for the next one.  I chose not to include my favorite or disfavorite tracks in the review because I believe readers should decide for themselves by getting the album.
B000002LVB|5.0|\\"The Velvet Underground and Nico,\\" \\"White Light/White Heat,\\" and \\"The Velvet Underground\\" all seem overrated to me, yet VU's swansong, 1970's \\"Loaded,\\" is one of my absolute favorites 70s rock albums.  Whereas the band's first three albums dabbled in obtuse guitar freakouts, lo-fi folk, and brittle garage rock, \\"Loaded\\" goes all-out baroque--it's loaded with swooning harmony vocals, ornate melodies, and some of Lou Reed's most complex lyrics and vocal performances.  The relatively accessible and straight-forward nature of this album has long drawn the ire of many who are too staunchly \\"indie\\" to acknowledge brilliant conventional pop music; nevertheless, \\"Loaded\\" is a masterpiece of songcraft and eclecticism.  If I had to chose between \\"The Velvet Underground and Nico\\" with its angular noise and \\"Loaded\\" with its unforgottable melodies, I would certainly pick the latter.  Starting with \\"Who Loves The Sun?,\\" \\"Loaded\\" jumps from one pop gem to another--if this indeed the \\"sellout record\\" that so many purport it to be, then it is undeniably the best sellout record of all-time.  \\"Sweet Jane\\" makes wondrous use of a three-chord progression, \\"Rock N Roll\\" is garage rock at its purest, \\"Oh! Sweet Nuthin'\\" is an epic, sprawling guitar anthem that beat Lynyrd Skynyrd to the punch by almost two years, and \\"I Found A Reason,\\" shockingly enough, was once sampled by the trip-hop ensemble Massive Attack.  This album is crisp and smooth, retaining the Velvets' knack for artsy pop while also adopting a more melodic approach that romances the ear.  Baroque, hummable, and blackly cool, this is The Velvet Underground's definitive statement.
B000066NW0|5.0|I like just about every kind of music, I have hundreds of CDS, and this is one of my favorites. I bought it for &quot;I'm with you,&quot; and at first I thought it was a weird CD, but the more I listened to it the more I loved it. I'm not a huge fan of her Sk8er boi song (however she spells it)or a couple of the others that made her famous, but the other songs on the CD are great. Whether she writes her songs or not, I think a lot of people can relate to what she's singing. I think her attitude sucks and she's not the hottest girl on the block, but she has talent, and I think this is a great CD for anyone who really gives it a chance and doesn't judge it based on the two songs that made it big.
B000003TAR|5.0|I can say almost nothing that will do justice to \\"In Utero,\\" because it is an album that is so far removed from conventional rock 'n roll as to be on a divinely inspired plane.  It is, in a way, music's answer to Faulkner's \\"As I Lay Dying\\"--a dark, purloined wasteland that captures the very sound of decay and rot.  Throughout these catharticly venomous songs, Kurt Cobain unearths a musical truth that is as raw as an exposed nerve and as repulsive as an infected cut: life is a contradiction, and only those who can balance this contradiction can be considered serious human beings.  As he writhes about on \\"Serve the Servants,\\" he intones \\"I just want you to know that I/Don't hate you anymore\\" atop a musical background that seethes with hateful, aggressive guitars.  During \\"Heart Shaped Box,\\" he says \\"Hey wait, I've got a new complaint,\\" so as to mock the perception of him as a whiner--yet he never surrenders this discontent image, because that would be \\"selling out.\\"  As one can see, he is both black and white at once, both yin and yang.  Furthermore, the main lyric of \\"Dumb,\\" (I think I'm dumb/or maybe just happy\\") though rudimentary, conveys a profound meaning--that happiness itself disgusted Cobain.  It is because of such messages that Kurt was an unparalleled and tortured genius.  In effect, he did not give into the naive American conception that one must always be optimistic and thus must block out all darkness--he spoke passionately for the depressed masses (\\"I miss the comfort/In being sad\\") that society skipped over in its characteriscally shallow and non-understanding manner.  In razing the world and spewing his dissatisfaction, Cobain delivers a set of throat-ripping narratives (\\"What is wrong with me?\\" he howls during \\"Radio Friendly Unit Shifter\\") and tortured messes that carry such sincere weight as to shame all those pretentious emo-screamer copycats who have followed Nirvana's inimitable example.  \\"Radio Friendly Unit Shifter,\\" the central song here, isso vitriolic, so dark, so authentic, that is can almost make me cry, so profound is its message.  While Cobain's swarthy lyrics are the towering centerpiece, the sludgy guitar melodies--which are among the finest tunes ever penned by a pop-punk ensemble--and thunderous rhythms are also interesting.  But even their brilliance takes the back seat to Cobain's revelatory state--his screams, so drowned in pain, are shocking canticles for the ages.  Forget all those other classic \\"hard rock\\" albums, all those overblown epics by Led Zeppelin and Aerosmith--\\"In Utero\\" is the real deal.  It is a record whose unsettling intensity communicates so much more than any one riff or note; it is, in effect, a well of darkness that reflects the sky (and the world) in perfect detail.
B000002INR|5.0|Ahh...Skid Row - New Jersey's second favorite sons... However, unlike Bon Jovi, the 'Row were always more about the music that the girls. In fact, put away that Aqua-Net: Skid Row aren't even a hair metal band at all!  Like G'n'R they fall more into the Hard Rock category, concerned more with life on the backstreets and sleazy motels than big cars. For me this adds an extra edge of credibility to this album that keeps it fresh even today...<br />Revisionist history aside, the main focus of the band (until his departure for Broadway of all things!) was Sebastian Bach. With his long blonde hair and tight leather pants he was guaranteed to draw screams from young girls, jealous, respect and throbbing homoerotic desire from young boys, and a terse \\"Is that a man or a woman?\\" from worried parents across the globe. Yessir, Seb could scream with the best of them and it's no wonder his scowl decorated a million teenager's walls.<br />Dave \\"the Snake\\" Sabo's chops were always more rock than metal, even if not especially technically amazing, giving them the power and the radio-friendliness to break out to a wider audience. However, the real star of the band, and the guy who saved them from typical hair metal oblivion, was Rachel Bolan.  The main songwriter in the band, his piercings gave away the fact that he was a punk at heart and that this metal nonsense was just a vehicle to get his ambition on the radio and his message out to the masses.<br />So the music itself is a mixture of rock and metal, with the punk edge that's uniquely theirs (and GnR's...).  The big singles \\"18 and Life\\" and \\"Youth gone Wild\\" defined a generation (for at least the 2 years until Nevermind was released and the face of music changed overnight...), while \\"I'll remember You\\" was the quintessential 80's rock ballad, even as it built on, and drew heavily from, Poison's \\"Every rose has it's thorn\\".<br />Outside the big three though, there's loads more hooks and fun to keep you coming back for more. \\"Big Guns\\" and \\"Making a Mess\\" belie Rachel's punk fascination, wile \\"Rattlesnake Shake\\", \\"Sweet Little Sister\\" and \\"Here I am\\" could've graced \\"Appetite\\" and certainly give \\"New Jersey\\" a run for it's money. For me the only disappointment is album closer \\"Midnight/Tornado\\", but hey, every rose has it's thorn, to coin a phrase.<br />Anyway, Skid Row rocked, and this album's amongst the top 3 rock albums of the eighties.and \\"Making a Mess\\" belie Rachel's punk fascination, wile \\"Rattlesnake Shake\\", \\"Sweet Little Sister\\" and \\"Here I am\\" could've graced \\"Appetite\\" and certainly give \\"New Jersey\\" a run for it's money.

B00008J4P5|3.0|After the promise of the Stripes last 2 albums, I was expecting more great things from these two.  White Blood Cells and De Stijl were really great albums and a nice change from the garbage being put out these days.  But, alas, the Stripes have taken a few steps back with this release.  Many of the songs a drawn out with the same beat or groove or lyrics repeated for 3 or 4 minutes.  People are calling this brilliant.  I don't understand.  Brilliant was appropriate on the last 2 albums, but unfortunately not this one.  I can't say not to get it, because there are some good tunes on this album.  They are just too infrequent to warrant a 4 or 5 star rating.
B000088E6D|5.0|I first heard his music on the web and I thought it was Frank.  When I found out that it was Michael Buble, I immediately started researching this new Classic voice. I went out and got his CD and have been a devoted fan ever since.  I now recommend his album to both family and friends because he is so versatile.  Probably the best CD purchase I've made in a long, long time. Can't say enough about him!
B0000DJZA5|4.0|When I first listened through this CD, I was happy with the much improved sound quality and the naked version of Long and Winding Road. Then I got curious and turned to play back the original Let It Be for the first time since early this year. It only took me two or three seconds to realize how superior the original album was, despite the inferior sound quality. As I can now tell, the strings in the original Winding Road unnecessary masked Paul's vocals. It is those chit-chats before and after the each song that made the original album so vivid and live. For instance, Get Back, for me, is not a complete song without Paul's &quot;One, Two, Three, Four&quot; at the beginning and John concluding, &quot;I hope we passed the audition.&quot; <BR>Disc 2 is a documentary disc that almost meaninglessly contains a bunch of short dialogues with bits and pieces of rehearsed songs. It did no good to compensate for the lost conversations and voices in the Disc 1. Original Let It Be was, I mean IS, indeed, a lively album, while the Naked version sounds dead in comparison.
B000060P79|1.0|Ok, this is complete crap.  There is no better way to describe it.  So of course hundreds of little preteen girls are going to rave about how easy it is to identify with.  It is only easy to identify with if you sit at home and whine about everything wrong in your life.  The people who are obsessed with this album are the same people you see trying to dress hardcore and under the impression they're a rebellious outcast because they listen to a band who sings about what it wants for Christmas.  Listen to Pennywise.
B0000AQVCL|4.0|What to say but &quot;Hell Yeah!!!&quot;<BR>Within the past 7 or 8 years music has been rather drab. Everything has seemed to have been replaced by annoying whiney rap-singers and just seems like it all has been going down the crapper. <BR> Now with the resurgance of real Rock and Roll things are looking up. This release is an excellent example of Rock and Roll for the 21st century.<BR> For all those who are into the classics like The Stones, The Who, The Beatles you'll surely to be impressed with this band.
B0000C9ZLD|5.0|And I'm going to say that &quot;Room on Fire&quot; is better than The Strokes debut. There's just something about this album that captivated me that &quot;Is This It?&quot; seemed to be missing. Altogether the album possesses great energy and many of the songs have fantastic hooks. <br />What I would disagree with is many people's claims that this album sounds exactly like &quot;Is This It?&quot;, because they don't sound the same. Not exactly anyways. It's evident in songs such as Reptilia, Automatic Stop, 1251, Under Control, and Between Love &amp; Hate that The Strokes were at least trying something new (for them, though not necessarily original). Although not incredibly impressive, the guitar work in this album is also a step above their first album. Altogether, &quot;Room on Fire&quot; isn't groundbreaking, but it is a small step towards something which The Strokes may be able to call their own someday. It's an improvement. <br />Ultimately, &quot;Room on Fire&quot;, like &quot;Is This It?&quot;, won't do anything to change the face of rock music. There's no life-altering experience to be had in listening to this CD. But why is that a bad thing? Why does good music have to be &quot;deep&quot; (read pseudo-intellectual)?&quot;Room on Fire&quot; is a lot of fun to listen to, and shouldn't that be enough? Your answer is your own. My only advice is to not buy into all the hype. Just listen to the music. If you don't have impossibly high expectations you won't be so disappointed.
B00000HZH7|1.0|Wow this album plain sounds sounds bad. This sounds worse than any other album I have ever heard, and I have heard plenty! This sounds worse than a cheap demo on a worn out cassette tape. I guess it doesn't matter because the songs are crap too. The vocals are terrible and so is the musicianship. This has to be one of the worst albums I have ever had the unpleasure of listening to! If you like metal, go listen to Slayer, Metallica, Megadeth, Testament, Iron Maiden, or Anthrax. Anyone but Possessed!
0156012197|2.0|The review by J.V. is a must-read if you're considering buying this translation.  Save yourself the trouble of Howard's translation, and head to a used bookstore.  I have read \\"The Little Prince\\" in its original French, and while Katherine Woods' translation is at times too literal, Howard's version is absolutely appalling.  I once bought it for a friend without having read it, and seriously considered returning it because it was just that bad.  <br />\\"The Little Prince\\" is my favorite book, but is not worth the money in this \\"improved\\" translation.
B00008NRI8|4.0|Not sure why everybody is yawning over this one. I bought it sight unseen because I like both of the stars. I was not disappointed, and have watched it three times already. <br />There is strong chemistry between these two, reminiscent of Day/Hudson and Roberts/Gere. Yes, the storyline is far-fetched, but if I wanted to be smacked with reality, I'd have bought a documentary.<br />There are a lot of laughs in this film, and a fairy-tale ending. Things I remember most: Mom's body language around Grant; the RV scene; the Milk-Dud shrew; &quot;What baby?&quot;; the waterfront party; &quot;Don't be silly. Have you MET everybody on earth?&quot;, and on and on.<br />Loads of bonus material, too, including two deleted scenes and a bloopers version of the movie (great fun).<br />I also have Miss Congeniality; frankly, I like this one better.
B0000CFW87|5.0|In reading the (few) negative reviews, it struck me that when a talented artist becomes immensely popular, the standard bar is raised proportionately.  So really, the fact they are worth being held up to close criticism is actually a compliment in reverse!  Here is a haunting hour of quality music, without cheap fillers, that improves with each playing and sticks in your head all day.  It's pure and true Josh and I wouldn't want it to be otherwise.

0156027321|4.0|The first half of the book up until the &quot;shipwreck&quot; is a bit boring, however once that part has ended the story is very exciting and graphic. You very much feel as though you are there. The ending will baffle you and have you thinking about it for days. I loved it! I did not give it 4 stars only because the first half of the story was so dull.
B00005JMFO|3.0|The sole redeeming qualities of this film -- other than Hugh Grant dancing -- are the beginning and the ending.  The story is soft to the point of mushy.  The characters fall in love predictably and with as much melodrama as two characters running towards each other on the beach in slow motion.  I found the stereotypical European anti Americanism to be irritating.  While the beginning and the ending have a feel good quality, I found the film to lack inspiration.
0767817486|1.0|As a Turkish citizen living in US, I agree strongly  there are many human rights issues that need to be improved in Turkiye. However I don't think it is fair to generalize to its people the system problem or politics. Some narrow minded people want to be judgemental with Turks just because of this movie, well I would say go ahead and see your own history with human rights, no need to go through detail here.
B00005JMFO|4.0|\\"Love Actually\\", directed by Richard Curtis (Notting Hill, Bridget Jones) is one of the most heart-warming films of the year; just in time for the holidays!  This charming British comedy boasts an all-star ensemble cast featuring Hugh Grant, Colin Firth, Emma Thompson, Liam Neeson, Alan Rickman, Bill Nighy, Martine McCutcheon, Keira Knightley, Laura Linney, and Rowan Atkinson.  The cast alone is a reason to go see it!<br />This film is what I would call an epic romantic \\"dramedy\\".  Spanning two and a half hours, it sometimes gets difficult to sit through in those uncomfortable theater seats.  But I'm here to tell your numb bum is completely worth it!  Yes, this is a comedy.  And yes, it is also a drama.  This film brought tears to my eyes, both from laughing so hard and by being extremely touched.  <br />The plot is tremendously intricate and I don't feel it necessary to go through.  All you need to know is that there are multiple storylines that all end up being interwoven with one another.  It's surprising to see how (nearly) all these very different people end up being connected to each other.  You know what they say; we're all seven links away from one another (or whatever it is).  All kinds of love are dealt with in this film; forbidden love, new love, young love, friendly love, passionate love, secret love...  \\"Love Actually\\" has it all!
B0000VCZK2|5.0|Wow! This set managed to give me appreciation for the ENTIRE Ripley/Alien trilogy, and even some respect for &quot;Resurrection&quot;.<br />I remember my dad and I watching &quot;Alien&quot; when I was 10 years old or so in a hotel Spectravision, and I remember being terrified by &quot;the perfect organism&quot;, (as Ash put it), and the conspiracy and duplicity of &quot;The Company&quot;.<br />Then in 1986, I remember seeing Sigourney Weaver and the Queen on the cover of Time with the caption &quot;Horrors!&quot; - and my dad and I just HAD to see it! Everything about it was great - Cameron executed this perfectly. One of the best examples of this is when Ripley, after rescuing Newt, stumbles into the Queen's chamber. The dramatic score suddenly stops, the camera pans around, and I'll bet there wasn't a single audience member who didn't gasp upon seeing the multitude of eggs and the egg-laying itself. I still shudder when I see it.<br />For a long time I thought Alien 3 and Resurrection where just pieces of junk, more Hollywood attempts to squeeze money out of a good franchise (and in the process, squeezing the life out of it as well). To me, those movies never existed - I thought they shamed Ridley Scott, Cameron, Weaver, and the xenomorph.<br />When I bought this, I gave the special edition of Alien 3 a whirl, and I found I liked it a lot better than the original. Yeah, so some of the Alien CGI isn't great - so what. By now we've seen the creature enough we know what it looks like. I came to enjoy the starkness of the movie, and the feeling of finality and despair for the inmates and Ripley. (Not to mention I like the way the Alien was born in this one...I don't like movies with canine casualties.)<br />Resurrection was pretty much the same. I never really liked it, and it was useful only in explaining more of the creatures life-cycle, which I always found interesting.<br />The extras are great - I usually skip them, but the &quot;Aliens&quot; disc, with all theinterviews, commentaries, etc. was FANTASTIC for a fan like me.<br />Since the original &quot;Alien&quot; and &quot;Aliens&quot; are out of print, I think this is the only way to get them on DVD now. But those two films are worth the price of admission.

B000002OMN|5.0|The only thing I can compare to the pleasure of buying Bat Out Of Hell II (Back Into Hell) was perhaps watching the Star wars Trilogy (the original).  Great drama, special effects, sound affects, and in the case of the CD bombastic glory! Longer songs, elaborate chorus, great orchestration, Jim Steinman is a genius plain and simple!  I have been waiting for 10 years for Part 3 (Bat Out Of Hell 3) where we find out how it all ends.  I recently heard the final saga is about to be made and released in 2004.  Weather it matches the commercial success of the two previous Bats really doesnt matter.  Considering Meatloafs new 2003 CD didnt even crack Billboards top 200 doesnt promise a whole lot for another multi platinum success.  If he pulls it off, Jim really will be considered a genuis.  But in either case, it will be a great end to The Bat Out Of Hell saga.  No way Jim Steinman will make a bad CD.  I have my $20 saved and will buy it the day it comes out.
0385504209|5.0|There are so many reviews already written on this #1 bestseller, there's no point in further summarizing the plot. It should be enough to know that Dan Brown's &quot;The Da Vinci Code&quot; has already inspired a TV documentary on the possibility that the book's premise is true. Not many works of fiction accomplish that. My general thoughts are that, simply put, this is the best thriller I've ever read. This is the book I want to write when I grow up. The action begins almost immediately, and never lets up. There are no weak spots. No points at which one loses interest or wishes the author wouldn't go off on some tangent in search of &quot;literary excellence.&quot; This is straight, old-fashioned story tellin'. And what a tale.<br />Critics can claim that the book is too &quot;commercial&quot; and formulaic, but while that may be true, it is the quintessential example.  The book is neither character nor plot driven; it's premise driven, and though the devices employed by Brown to transfer the enormous body of research to the reader become less than transparent, the concept is so intriguing that the book works. It more than works. He makes believable an otherwise preposterous and controversial supposition: that the Holy Grail is a highly guarded collection of documents proving that there are living ancestors to the offspring of Jesus Christ and Mary Magdelene. My single complaint is one that can't be fixed. One gets so swept up in this history lesson and Grail quest that a letdown is inevitable. Neither Brown nor his protagonist know the definitive truth or location of the Grail, and therefore, despite the growing feeling that you're about to learn some fantastic universal truth, you're left at book's end with the rather depressing realization that you've simply read a good book, and nothing more.<br />I generally avoid the New York Times best seller list. Not because those books aren't good, but because it's often a mystery why those select few have been filtered out of the pack and afforded full support and attention by the industry, media, and reading public to the detriment of the thousands of worthy midlist writers left behind. This is one book that in my opinion deserves its place at the top. And Brown deserves every penny for his effort. --Christopher Bonn Jonnes, author of BIG ICE and WAKE UP DEAD.ut of the pack and afforded full support and attention by the industry, media, and reading public to the detriment of the thousands of worthy midlist writers left behind.

B0000E1WKE|5.0|This is a wonderful album. Let me say the only bad reviews I see are from mariah nuts, that tells me a lot! Whitney holds notes for as long as 15 seconds on this album. She Belts, she hits High Notes, Low notes on \\"I'll Be Home For Christmas\\", Low notes that I didn't know she was capable of hitting!. The girl sangs her butt off on ONE WISH and No One can deny it. Just read the NewYork Times Review, or the NY Post ect..ect, they are all singing her praises, along with me,lol. It's a shame to see mariah fans are this Evil because I've met mariah and she would not approve or encourage this of her so called \\"fans\\". Anyway, add Whitney Houston to your Christmas list, you'll be happy you did. After all..she is as Oprah Winfrey put it...THE VOICE!!!

0446677450|2.0|This is not a how-to book. <br />It has, as already mentioned by many reviewers, more of a motivational effect on its readers than an educational one. The motivational effect of the book most likely comes from Kiyosaki's salesmanship of his ideas. He writes to emotionalise, not to proove, his principles. I have found most of these tactics (like insider trading) to be illegal (thankfully not from personal experience). Following this book word for word as gospel, as a how-to-book, will get you into trouble. Jail, problems with tax authorities, the government, your family and friends, homelessness etc. I bet that Kiyosaki doesn't (/isn't naïve enough to) follow his own advice. Why am I sure that he doesn't do this? Simple; he's not in jail! <br />As an educational product, I wouldn't recommend it. Why? Most of the principles (and Kiyosaki's supposed implementation of them) are exaggerated. They are not factual, but often contradictory or self-aggrandising. And, as many people are coming to suspect, they are probably totally fictional. <br />IMHO, this is one of the most fictional books ever categorised as non-fiction. <br />For instance, he recommends one should own a corporation and write off buying a Porsche (on behalf of the corporation's owner, i.e. you) as a corporate expense. This will save you taxes. However, he does not (as all demagogues do) talk about the disadvantages of using his teachings, such as the increased suspicion of the tax authorities that audit your business and then possibly fine you severely or making you cough up the money. They will question you - Porsche or not! <br />He boasts of wealth (real millionaires don't flaunt their wealth at every opportunity) and is clearly very materialistic. He says that \\"money buys me freedom,\\" yet he is caged in his limited perception of true wealth. To underline this statement; he teaches that the reason you should have friends is to profit from them economically (like people doing insider trading for you =illegal). This is a totally mercenary attitude. I can't believe that someone who writes a best-seller harbours such limiting attitudes.<br />A lot of the book contains his and \\"Rich Dad's\\" teachings about the inferiority and weakness (= we're so great, since we're rich) of people who choose to be employees, for whom job security is a prime factor in choosing one's life path. In Cashflow Quadrant, the sequel to RDPD, he teaches that each kind of path in life has its own advantages and disadvantages. No path is better than the other; all are subjective. Clear contradiction - sadly not an exception to the rule. <br />This is a man who, supposedly following his own teachings, retired at the age of 47 and now slaves away selling his books and products. He probably works more now than he did before. Some freedom...<br />The stand that is taken towards people who aren't trying to become like the mystical Rich Dad is quite degrading. But then, Rich Dad believed in giving to charity and being generous. These are extremely amiable traits. I'm puzzled; if one is charitable and generous, then why would one act self-righteously and degrade other people?<br />Many people say \\"This book made me think about finances!\\" Doh! The tax people make you think about finances each year! Some might even quit their job because of what Kiyosaki sells them during the course of reading this book. That would be sick. Do yourself a favour and educate yourself to become a businessperson, not a Kiyosaki-cult member, before setting up shop.<br />I bought the ebook version of RDPD. I learnt how NOT to do things and how NOT to think. And then I bought Cashflow Quadrant and it reinforced what I had learned NOT to do to a great extent. However...<br />... I didn't do my homework before buying them. Now I've been taught a lesson in how to buy books about finances and wealth, I think that the twenty dollars that I spent on both ebooks was not a lot. After all, I won't be falling for this stuff in the future and will save myself a lot of unnecessary risk and wasted money. <br />I bought it because I had `heard many good things' about the book. Then I made my discovery and learnt my lesson. The lesson: <br />Study both the praise and criticism of a book before you buy it - no matter how hyped or popular it is, ALWAYS. <br />I was ignorant enough to buy it without doing my homework first. I hope that you're cleverer than I was. <br />Where should you go to find out about the science of wealth creation and success?

B00005AAFS|5.0|this album is damn cool!it's not quite as heavy as sehnsucht, but it makes up for it in musical quality. i listen to majority of death/black metal(go CoF,go dimmu borgir!) and i even love this. now simplified: buy this album, it's great(ya, eat that Tony!)
B000062YB1|5.0|This is my all time favorite Slayer record. The once CD I will never be without.
B0000DD7LB|5.0|All I could say is &quot;man, this cd rocks!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!&quot; This is Britneys best album ever! All the songs on this cd rock so much that I dont have to skip through songs to find a favorite! Britney has done it again with this cd! The first time I listened to it, I did'nt really like it but the seond time, I loved it! I listen to it every day, on my way to school, in school, on my way home, and before I go to sleep! My favorite song is &quot;I got that boom boom&quot;, this song rocks! I also like &quot;toxic&quot;! All I could say is &quot;BUY THIS ALBUM!!!!&quot; Please dont burn it help Britney out and just buy it! It's way better than Christina Aguileras Cd! Christina Aguilera has the voice but she doesnt have the body or the moves Britney has, and Britneys songs are better to listen to than Christinas. At least Britney keeps her mouth shut about other people! So please buy this cd because it rocks my world and it will also rock your's!
B000069CWE|5.0|I was very hesitant to buy this CD when it first came out because I thought an album of remixes can't possibly be good. But I bought this anyway because I am a big LP fan. I was very surprised to find that this CD was f*cking great! I loved Hybrid Thoery, don't get me wrong. But this CD...they went all the hell out remixing these songs! They do not even sound like the same songs on the first album...this isn't even like a remix CD! It's a whole new album. LP did everything they wanted to on this CD. The songs do not sound like your typical remix where they add more bass or take bass out or add a hook featuring some other artist...NO! They reworked everything...more guitar, different lyrics, more drums, more bass...louder. You can definately tell they had fun on this one. This CD definately showcases their many many talents. This is CD to bump in the car!
B00000DCHD|5.0|52nd Street was the very first Billy Joel album I ever owned, having convinced my older sister to part with her bulky eight-track cassette (remember eight-track tapes?) when she moved out on her own.  For a while, I adopted &quot;My Life,&quot; Joel's ode to independent thought, as my own anthem of (lukewarm) teenage rebellion.  Then, the eight-track craze died -- as did my stereo system -- and 52nd Street was consigned to my dustbin of discarded debris.<br />I rediscovered my love for Joel's eclectic style in the last few weeks of my senior year in high school when I heard a few songs from the then-current Nylon Curtain at a friend's house, and slowly my Billy Joel collection grew, first in cassette format, then in compact discs.  Most of the latter are from the tail end of Billy's pop-rock days, but when I saw the remastered version of 52nd Street, I just had to get it.<br />52nd Street's set of nine songs ranges from the aforementioned &quot;My Life&quot; (which Tom Hanks fans may also remember as the theme song to his 1980s vintage sitcom &quot;Bosom Buddies&quot;) to the lyrical and insightful &quot;Honesty.&quot; I like its melancholic melody and comments on human nature (&quot;Honesty is such a lonely word/Everyone is so untrue....&quot;)  I also enjoy the biting sarcasm of &quot;Big Shot,&quot; the descriptive narrative of &quot;Zanzibar&quot; and the Latin-inspired rhythms and melody of the lovely &quot;Rosalinda's Eyes.&quot;<br />The one thing I did not like about this 1998 re-issue was the inclusion of CD-Extra software that was supposed to play videos on PCs using Windows 95-98 operating systems.  While I haven't tried running this enhanced CD on my e-Machines T2482 computer, all other attempts to do so on my previous PCs failed. Granted, the CD comes with a disclaimer warning that the software will not work on all machines, so not everyone will have problems like I did.
B0000DJZA5|3.0|Instead of giving the fans even ONE full CD of alternate takes, busking and jamming excerpts from the LIB sessions, Paul gives us this skimpy, pathetic attempt to rewrite history - and doesn't even do it in a fortright, honest manner.  &quot;The band's cut&quot;.  Oh come on!  Is there anyone out there dumb enough to fall for that?  Were John and George there for the edits and remixes done in the past couple of years? And if this was &quot;the band's cut&quot;, why didn't they pick the best takes of the songs?  The original single version of Don't Let Me Down (on Past Masters)is perfect.  I agree - it should have been on the original album.  The version on LIBN isn't bad but if you're going to sell the album as if its been remixed to reflect the way it should have been, then wouldn't you have used the best version of all the songs?  So what is LIBN then?  Alternate takes? Or the way the album really should have been?  My theory: Neither. Paul wanted LIB remixed the way he wanted it but someone at EMI/Apple realized that since Spector-less versions of the songs were previously released (Anthology, Past Masters) LIBN would sell better if some alternate versions of songs were substituted to give the fans something &quot;new&quot;.  Like the orginal, then, it became a mish-mash.  The second disc is suspect too:  it's full of chatter about how they were going to do the album - like Paul is trying to provide some &quot;evidence&quot; to support his claim that LIBN is the way they meant LIB to be.  Please - give us more outakes, jamming, alternate song versions, etc. - but no more albums rearranged to support one band member's version of history.  And don't tell us that this is supported by all the band members when we know darn well that's both not true and impossible.
